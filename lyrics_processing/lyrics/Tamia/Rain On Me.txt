Wasting time running from my fears
When all the while you've been right here
Waiting on me
If I'd have told you what I'm going through
You would have let me know just what to do
And now I know the answer lies in you
This is my pain cuz
I've been hurt so bad
Sometimes it makes me sad
Would you rain on me?
Woudl you please rain on me?
I don't understand
This was not my plan
Would you rain on me?
I'm beggin' please
(Don't stop the rain)
Sometimes I felt all alone
Nothing or no one to call my own
But you're the only one who will be
Faithful forevermore
Deep down inside my soul
You're the only one who really knows
What I need to make me whole
So I can smile again, I
You might also likeI've been hurt so bad
Sometimes it makes me sad
Would you rain on me?
Would you rain on me, oh yeah
I don't understand
This was not my plan
Would you rain on me?
Would you please rain on me?
(Don't stop the rain)
I've been hurt so bad
Sometimes it makes me sad
Would you rain on me?
Would you please take my hand?
I don't understand
This was not my plan
Would you rain on me?
How could we ever be apart, oh rain on me
(Don't stop the rain)
Rain on me
Show me love
I'm raining on you
Yes, I know sometimes it's rough
Tell me what to do, oh
Rain on me
You showed me love
I'm hanging on you
You said that I could trust in you
That's what I'm gonna do, oh
I've been hurt so bad
Sometimes it makes me sad
Would you rain on me?
I really need you, I really need you
I don't understand

I've been hurt so bad
Sometimes it makes me sad
