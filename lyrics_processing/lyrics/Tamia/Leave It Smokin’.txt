Closed eyes open wide
Do you get the message I'm tryna send to you
I'm not one to waste time
So baby let our mind set vibes split in two
I don't wanna talk
I just wanna lay in silence in your arms
I don't wanna play it safe, no
I just wanna break every rule like criminals
Savage individuals

So let's give into our temptations
Every minute with you
Let's exceed our expectations
Every moment with you
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'

Maybe we need a shot we can chase with lime
Whatever it takes to unwind
I wanna make you leave your comfort zone
Take everything off, put my body on you
You might also like
Let's give into our temptations
Every minute with you
Let's exceed our expectations
Every moment with you
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'

I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
I want you out of my comfort zone
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
I want you out of your comfort zone
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
Leave it smokin'
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
Smoking, you on the way, you on the way
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
I want you out of my comfort zone
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
I want you out of your comfort zone
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
Leave it smokin'
I'm on the way out, I'm on the way out
Leave it smokin', you on the way, you on the way
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
Leave it smokin', leave it smokin'
I need passion like fire (fire) fire (fire)
