I noticed you ain't been around lately
I recognize there's a sudden change
I noticed you haven't been calling me
I'm starting to see things aren't the same
Lately I've been reaching out to you
Boy, you haven't been returning my calls
And even when I say I love you
I notice there's been a slight pause

Please tell me what do you think it could be
Headache, tired, or cheating on me
I'm tired of this up and down mystery
Please answer questions from one two three

Do he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?
Ooh, ladies, help me out
Do he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?
Said I'm tired of all these ups and downs
Do he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?
Fellas, tell me what y'all think
Do he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?
Here's the reason why I ask these things...

I was giving him the best of me
But my best stopped being good enough
I'm telling you I would do anything
Talk about a woman who loves tough
And now he's coming home real real late
I let him know it's starting to bother me
He never once even touched his plate
And no response, he just went to sleep

Can you see why I ask these things?
Used to take me shopping (all the time)
Used to go club hoppin' (all the time)
Where you were, I would be (all the time)
Now all you do is leave me (behind, boy)
I used to be your best friend (remember)
We were close like cousins (remember)
Used to give me lovin' (and now)
Now all you're doing is trippin'
