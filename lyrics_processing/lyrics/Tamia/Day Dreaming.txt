Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Look at my mind floating away

He's the kind of guy that would say
Hey baby, let's get away let's go some place, huh
Where I don't care
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
Your trust, your heart, share all of your love, 'til death do us part
I wanna be what he wants when he wants it, whenever he needs it
And whenever he's lonesome and love starved
I'll be there to feed it
I'm lovin' him a little bit more each day
He turns me right on when I hear him say

(Hey baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh, baby, can we)
Where I don't care
(Hey baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, oh, baby, can we)
Where I don't care
