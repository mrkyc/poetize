Could I be falling for you?
Is this a fantasy come true?
Is this a dream that I've waited for?
Am I the one that you adore?

Whoa, whoa, I think I'm falling for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what am I supposed to do?
'Cause you make me feel like I'm falling in love
Am I falling for you?

Could it be love? Tell me, boy, is it true
I get a rush when i think about you
Lose control of my body and my soul
And when you hold me I don't wanna let go
You give me reason, every reason just to love you, baby
Everything that you do is so amazing
I can't believe what your body makes me wanna do
I'm having visions of me all over you

Whoa, whoa (Whoa), I think I'm falling for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, what am I supposed to do?
'Cause you make me feel like I'm falling in love
Am I falling for you? (Oh) (Doo-doo-doo-oh)
You might also like
You must've known though I tried to disguise
The way I feel was there fire in my eyes
On that night when our bodies intertwined
Knew right then and there that you will be mine
