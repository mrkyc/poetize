Can you tell me how can one miss what she's never had?
How could I reminisce when there is no past?
How could I have memories of being happy with you, boy?
Can someone tell me how can this be?
How could my mind pull up incidents
Recall dates and times that never happened?
How could we celebrate a love that's too late
And, how could I really mean the words I'm 'bout to say?

I miss the times that we almost shared
I miss the love that was almost there
I miss the times that we used to kiss
At least in my dreams, just let me take my time and reminisce
I miss the times that we never had
What happened to us? We were almost there
Whoever said it's impossible to miss what you never had
Never almost had you

I can not believe I let you go
Or what I should say is
I should have grabbed you up and never let you go
I should have went out with you
I should have made you my boo, boy
Yeah, that's one time I should have broke the rules
Should have went on a date
Should have found a way to escape
Should have turned it almost into if it happened, now it's too late
How could I celebrate a love that wasn't real?
And if it didn't happen, why does my heart feel?
