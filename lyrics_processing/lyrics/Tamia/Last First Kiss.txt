Can I talk to you for a second?
I just a have a few things I wanna tell you
Don't be nervous

When it comes to you, I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't even change the things I could change
'Cause baby, you're perfect, perfect to me
Simply means that you are perfect for me
You're the answer to a prayer I haven't prayed
Got me ready to settle down
I think I wanna say I'm fallin' in love with you
I'm so feeling all of this
Baby, I'm praying that you're

My last first kiss
Baby, won't you be my last time
Kissing somebody for the very first time
All my ladies say (La la la la la la)
Our first time making love
Baby, I pray that this is the last time
That I make love to for the very first time
My ladies say (La la la la la la)
You might also like
Feel what I'm saying
I hope that you're the last
Somebody to take me home
To meet his mom and dad
I hope that its the last first time I say I love you
Hope that its the last first time you say you love me too
Don't wanna ever kiss and say goodbye
If you just wanna kick it then
You're wasting my time
'Cause my plan is to not just have a hit and quit
My plan is to make you

My last first kiss
Baby, won't you be my last time
Kissing somebody for the very first time
All my ladies say (La la la la la la)
Our first time making love
Baby, I pray that this is the last time
That I make love to for the very first time
My ladies say (La la la la la la)

The first time I kissed you I just knew it felt right
Then when I'm with you I'm walking cloud nine
Just being with you makes my whole life shine
Whenever I'm with you, whenever I kiss you
The first time I kissed you I just knew it felt right
Then when I'm with you I'm walking cloud nine
Just being with you makes my whole life shine
Whenever I'm with you
My last first kiss
Baby, won't you be my last time
Kissing somebody for the very first time
Ladies say (La la la la la la)
The first time making love
Baby, I pray that this is the last time
That I make love too for the very first time
Ladies say (La la la la la la)
My last first kiss
Baby, won't you be my last time
Kissing somebody for the very first time
Ladies sing it (La la la la la la)
The first time making love
The first time I kissed you i just knew it felt right
Then when I'm with you I'm walking cloud nine
Just being with you makes my whole life shine
Whenever I'm with you

My last first kiss, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
