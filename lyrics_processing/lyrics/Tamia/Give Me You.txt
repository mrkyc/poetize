Sexy words (Sexy words)
Don't mean that much to me
'Cause I've heard just about everything
That a man could ever say
To me to make me stay, before
Now I need more

So don't bring me roses, bring me the truth
Don't buy me diamonds 'cause that just won't do
Material things I can buy myself if I really want to
I need something special, I need something new
Just give me you

Spare me the part (Spare me the part)
When you shower me with gifts
Don't send me cards, no box of chocolates
And don't promise me the world
I'm not that type of girl
That needs that to feel complete

So don't bring me roses, bring me the truth
And don't buy me diamonds 'cause that just won't do
Material things I can buy myself if I really want to
I need something special, I need something new
Just give me you (Give me you)
Just give me you, yes (Give me you)

Oh, things of this world don't mean that much to me
I need your heart and I need honesty
If all you've got is flashiness
Then please turn around and leave

Don't bring me roses, bring me the truth
Don't buy me diamonds 'cause that just won't do
Material things I can buy myself if I really want to
I need something special, I need something new
Don't bring me roses, bring me the truth
Don't buy me diamonds 'cause that just won't do
Material things I can buy myself if I really want to
I need something special, I need something new
Just give me you (Give me you)
Just give me you, baby (Give me you)
All I need is you (Give me you)
Give me you (Give me you)
