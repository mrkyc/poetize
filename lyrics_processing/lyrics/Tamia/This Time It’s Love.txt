Out of this heart of mine
Never letting no one in
Didn't think I need a friend
Until now, feeling this way won't do
I'm ready to give all of me
The question that I have of you
Will he say the things he needs to say?
Or touch me in a certain way?
I told myself just to be strong
One day the man will come along, so
What will I do?
Where will I go?
When it's my turn
How will I know that you're the man
I'm dreaming of?
I hope this time it's love
(Repeat)
Now you've opened up this heart of mine
You made me feel like no one else
Showed me there's someone besides myself
That I can depend on
Looking back I finally see
Exactly what you mean to me
You touched me in that special way
Said all the things a man should say
I kept my faith and I just stayed strong
My man finally came along
You might also likeWhat will I do?
Where will I go? (where do I go?)
When it's my turn (when it's my turn)
How will I know (how will I know)
That you're the man I'm dreaming of?
I hope this time it's love
What will I do?
Where will I go?
When it's my turn
How will I know that you're the man
I'm dreaming of?
I hope, I hope this time its love
Every single day we knew
My love grows deeper and stronger its true
'Cause you've shown me things I've never known
You gave me strength to carry on
'Cause sometimes I'm afraid to let you in
Even though I know you're a good man
Still thoughts of doubt run through my mind
There's questions I have so tell me what to do
What will I do?
Where will I go?
When it's my turn
How will I know that you're the man
I'm dreaming of?
I hope this time it's love
