I look in the mirror with you in my arms
And I see a reflection of a smile that says
You believe in love
And just for a moment
I drifted away, but I couldn't stay, darling
A hint of love, a bit of fear
I'm tryin' to say

If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you, I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
Because I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here
(Ooh, yeah)

I'm tryin' to protect you
From the lies that your heart tells
Even though it says that you want me
All I see is pain and misery
Seasons may change
But I can't forget the days of old
My heart ached when he walked away
I said I'd never love again
You might also like
If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you, I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
Because I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here, ooh

Days go by
And I feel that you can make me happy
Time goes on
And I feel that love is at my door
And though I tell myself that you're the one
I've said those words before, though it hurts too much
I can't trust in love
Again, again

If I were you, I wouldn't be here (Oh, if I were you)
If I were you, I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here (Oh, ooh)
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
'Cause my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you, I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love (Make sure that she still believes)
In love, in love
If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you, I would stay right where you are
I wouldn't come near this broken heart
Just turn around and leave here
And find someone who won't hurt you
Make sure that she still believes in love
My heart has given up
I can't be here
If I were you, I wouldn't be here
If I were you, I would stay right where you are
Because I think my heart has given up
If I were you, I wouldn't be here, ooh
Oh, if I were you, I wouldn't be here
