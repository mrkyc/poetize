And I don't need another conversation about the way we're supposed to be
Now I see that you're gone and I don't believe after everything
I have to get over you
How could you make me love you and then just walk away
Like you never did a thing to lead me on in any kind of way
How could you make me feel so helpless every day
From the path you laid before me
These are things I've collected along the way
I got tears in my eyes sometimes
And I got a bad case of sleep less nights
And I got holding you on my mind
And I try to think of ways I can get you back all the time
Oh baby, that's a lot of weight to carry every day
These are things I've collected along the way
Every time I think about it I hate it in every way
Said I thought I couldn't live without you but I live with it every day
Never thought I'd see the day that you would ever leave
But now I'm here sifting through memories
How could you make me love you and then just walk away
Like you never did a thing to lead me on in any kind of way
How could you make me feel so helpless every day
From the path you laid before me
These are things I've collected along the way
I got tears in my ears sometimes
And I got a bad case of sleep less nights
And I got holding you on my mind
(Holding you all the time)
And I try to think of ways I can get you back all the time
(I gotta get you back in my life)
Oh baby, that's a lot of weight to carry every day
(That's a lot of weight to carry, lot of weight to carry)
These are the things I've collected along the way)
I got tears in my ears sometimes
(I cry)
And I got a bad case of sleep less nights
(I got a bad case)
And I got holding you on my mind
And I try to think of ways I can get you back all the time
(All the time)
Oh baby, that's a lot of weight to carry every day
(You see, it doesn't matter any way)
Every day, every day, every day
I got tears in my ears sometimes
(Every day)
And I got a bad case of sleep less nights
