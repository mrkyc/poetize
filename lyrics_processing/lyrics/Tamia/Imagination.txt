What makes us do
The things we do
That keeps me lovin' you?
Imagination
And when you're in need
Ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free

Everything you want is real close when you close your eyes
And the things you think about the most
They come to life (Come to life)
When your relationship is headed for the rocks
Gotta use your imagination to get you back on top

What makes us do (Ooh, yeah)
The things we do
That keeps me lovin' you?
Imagination (Imagination)
And when you're in need (Ooh, yeah)
Ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free (Oh, yeah)

It's the place you look when you wanna have some fun
When you see it, say it, before it's done, uh-huh
Imagine you and me, and how it would feel
Explorin' new ideas in what's gon' keep this lovin' real?

When you get lonely (Lonely)
It'll make you get to a phone and tell me how much you want me (Get to a phone and how much you want me)
And when you have a bad day (A bad day)
A little bit of imagination goes a long way, yeah

Uh, true boss player, that's the Chichi
Wanna get up out the store, you need to see me
Now I got you wonderin' what's behind the slouch
If you get too close, will you get turned out?
No doubt, it won't be the same if I hit it
'Cause you always gon' want it the way I did it
I'ma keep you fresh, make sure you stay kitted
See, once I got it, can't nobody else get it
From the bottom to the top, till you say stop
You and me, with the freaky south, my gray drop
I'll kiss everything, I don't miss a spot
Stuff you ain't never seen from the man you got
I ain't hatin', my imagination's just more advanced
So when you wanna dance, I'ma make you dance
Tamia, I see ya, I'm still waitin'
You make me wanna, leave that to your imagination
Yeah, yeah
What makes us do (Oh, oh)
The things we do
That keeps me lovin' you? (Keeps me lovin' you)
Imagination
And when you're in need (Oh)
Ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free (Sets you free, free)
What makes us do
The things we do
That keeps me lovin' you?
Imagination
And when you're in need
Ain't got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free
What makes us do
The things we do
That keeps me lovin' you?
Imagination
And when you're in need
Ain't got nobody
