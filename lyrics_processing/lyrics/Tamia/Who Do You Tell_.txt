There you were in a crowded room
With someone at least I assumed
How did I know I would fall in love
With you so soon
Just one look in your eyes
And I see the truth
And I try hard to hide that I'm made for you
But I know deep inside things that we could do
Just as long as we're together
But...

Who do you tell when you love someone
Hoping that someone's in love with you
Who do you tell when you love someone
I think I might as well tell you

I can't believe that I feel this way
There is so much that I want to say
I wanna (Touch you) hold you
(Feel you) please you
As we're making love all through the night
We would talk to each other
We would laugh and play
We would claim it's forever every night and day
We would share every minute 'til the test of time
(In my mind)

Who do you tell when you love someone
Hoping that someone's in love with you
Who do you tell when you love someone
I think I might as well tell you
Who do you tell when you love someone
Hoping that someone's in love with you
Who do you tell when you love someone
I think I might as well tell you

I've hesitated much too many times
And I won't let you slip away from me no
I know you're for me
And me for you
But I don't know what to say or to do
So now that we're together I'm telling you

Who do you tell when you love someone
Hoping that someone's in love with you
Who do you tell when you love someone
I think I might as well tell you
