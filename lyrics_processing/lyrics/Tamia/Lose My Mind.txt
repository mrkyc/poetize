Is it morning already? Damn
I was just getting used to you by my side (Don't go)
I'm having trouble getting past
The part when I have to tell you goodbye

I know you got a job to do
And I understand that you gotta go, oh
But I don't ever get to sleep
A moment of peace 'til I get u home
And it hurts so bad to miss you like that

Every day my baby's gone away, I just lose my mind
Yes, I lose my mind, lose my mind (Lose my mind)
Even when I know that it won't be for long
I just lose my mind, yes I lose my mind
Lose my mind

Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side (Oh no)
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind over my baby, baby
Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind
You might also like
You just can't imagine, no
The way that you got a hold of my heart (Ooh ooh)
And I just can't stand it, no
Every time I have to watch you depart (Ooh ooh)
I know it's kinda selfish
But I really just want your love to myself, yeah
'Cause every minute I'm alone
It feels like I am going through hell
And it hurts so bad to miss you like that

Every day my baby's gone away, I just lose my mind
Yes, I lose my mind (Lose my mind)
Even when I know (I know) that it won't be for long
I just lose my mind, yes I lose my mind (Yeah)

Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side (No, no)
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind over my baby, baby
Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind
What can I do? (Hey)
I'm crazy over you (Hey)
I hate to see you go (Hey)
I'm so outta control (Hey, hey, hey)
I miss you bad (Hey)
Soon as you turn your back (Hey)
It happens every time (Hey)
I start to lose my mind (Hey, ooh ooh), oh

Every day my baby's gone away
I just lose my mind (Lose my mind)
Yes, I lose my mind (Lose my mind)
Even when I know, I know that it won't be for long
I just lose my mind, yes I lose my mind, oh oh

Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side, oh
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind over my baby, baby
Drip drop, tears don't stop
When he ain't by my side
All day, all damn night
Start to lose my mind
I start to lose it
Over my baby, baby
Over my baby, baby
