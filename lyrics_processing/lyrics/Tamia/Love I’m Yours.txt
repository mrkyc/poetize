I'm hiding deep in my shadow
Hoping that love won't look for me here
I know I have to keep moving
Or I could be found by the scent of my fears

Because love and I
We broke up one night
And the sad thing is it was my fault, my call
I cry late at night
Though there's tears in my eyes
I know myself, I'm ready to try again

Love, how did you find me?
How is this happening?
I ran so far away
How did you catch me?
But now that you found me
I'm ready to love again
Ready to give him
What's left of my heart
I won't cry anymore
I won't close no more doors
I guess what I'm saying is
Here, love, I'm yours, oh
You might also like
I spent some time alone working
Looking inside and working on me, yeah
I know I called you the stranger
Like it was your fault but now I can see

Because love and I
We broke up one night
And the sad thing is it was my fault, my call
No more crying at night
No more tears in my eyes
I know myself, I'm ready to try again

Love, how did you find me?
How is this happening?
I ran so far away
How did you catch me?
But now that you found me
I'm ready to love again
Ready to give him
What's left of my heart
I won't cry anymore
I won't close no more doors
I guess what I'm saying is
Here, love, I'm yours, ooh
No, no
How did you find me?
How is this happening?
I ran so far away
How did you catch me?

Love, how did you find me?
How is this happening?
I ran so far away
How did you catch me?
But now that you found me
I'm ready to love again
Ready to give him
What's left of my heart
I won't cry anymore
I won't close no more doors
I guess what I'm saying is
Here, love, I'm yours
