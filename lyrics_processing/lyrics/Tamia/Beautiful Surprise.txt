For the first time in my life
I just might be tongue-tied
For me to wake up with you kissing me
Saying you've been missing me
What a beautiful surprise

'Cause I wasn't expecting you 'til late tonight, no
And I didn't hear you come inside
But there's nothing in this world that I want more
Than to have my baby back in my arms
All I can say is

Ooh, ah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, ah, my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise, yeah

I ain't that easy to shock
But it looks like you hit the spot, hoo, ooh
For me to wake up with you holding me
And telling me you're loving me
You've got my heart on lock, yeah
You might also like
Yeah, 'cause I wasn't expecting you 'til late tonight, no
And I didn't hear you come inside
But there's nothing in this world that I want more
Than to have my baby back in my arms
All I can say is

Ooh, ah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, ah, my man is back at my side
What a beautiful surprise

Yeah, I was needing you so bad, you know
It feels like I'm dreaming, my mind is blown
For you to be the first thing that I see when I open my eyes
Such a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful surprise

Ooh, ah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, ah, my man is back at my side
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, ah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Ooh, ah, my man is back at my side
What a beautiful surprise
Beautiful, yeah (Yeah yeah)
Beautiful surprise, yeah (Yeah yeah)
A beautiful surprise, yeah (Yeah yeah)
A beautiful surprise, yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
