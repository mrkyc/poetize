Fell in love, had everything that I wanted
What a life for me...
Now a thing don't mean a thing
Since we've parted
Meant the world to me...
And though my heart's still beatin'
When will I breathe again
And when will someone wake me from
This awful dream I'm in?

If you could see the way I live my life
If you could see the way I cry at night
If you could understand the reasons why
That I'm loving you still...
If you could hear me when I call your name
You gotta know it's driving me insane
I know I'll never ever love again
'Cause I'm loving you still

I had someone watch over me, my protector
Kept me safe and warm
I had someone makin' love to me
I thought forever
But forever now is gone...
So I spend my days pretending
I spend my nights alone
I've never missed somebody so
I've never loved so strong
You might also like
If you could see the way I live my life
If you could see the way I cry at night
If you could understand the reasons why
That I'm loving you still...
If you could hear me when I call your name
You gotta know it's driving me insane
I know I'll never ever love again
'Cause I'm loving you still

And now that you have gone away
Lord knows that I must pray
That we will meet again
But until then...

If you could see the way I live my life
If you could see the way I cry at night
If you could understand the reason why
That I'm loving you still...
Could hear me when I call your name
It's driving me insane
No I'll never ever love again
I'm loving you still
Live my life
Cry at night
You could understand the reason why
That I'm loving you still...
Could hear me when I call your name
It's driving me insane
No I'll never ever love again
Cause I'm loving you still
Live my life
Cry at night
Loving you still
Call your name
