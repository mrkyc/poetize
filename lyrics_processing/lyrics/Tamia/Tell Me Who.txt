Wait a minute!
There's something on my mind
I can't hold it in any longer
Turn around
Don't just turn the radio down
I don't wanna hear a-
Or a-
Or a-
Or a-
No, no, no
Wait a minute
There's something I wanna say
Tell me who joined us in the bed last night
Don't look at me crazy, it did not feel right
A little to drink, but had a lot to say
Tell me who it was, tell me who it was
Whoever she was, she was on your mind
You stuttered a name that didn't sound like mine
This silence right now could jeopardize you and I
Tell me who it was
Who? Tell me who it was

Tell me who joined us in the bed last night (Ooh)
Don't look at me crazy, it did not feel right (Ooh)
A little to drink, but had a lot to say (Tell me who)
Tell me who it was, tell me who it was (Who)
Whoever she was, she was on your mind
You stuttered a name that didn't sound like mine
This silence right now could jeopardize you and I (Tell me who)
Tell me who it was, tell me who it was (Oh, tell me who)
You might also like
You left home early
And you came home late (again)
I know there's something goin' on
Tell me what it is
What does she have that I
Don't? Try to even lie
I just wanna know the truth
Last night while you were in my bed
You brought Cathy, Tracy, Trina home with you
Tell me

Tell me who joined us in the bed last night
Don't look at me crazy, it did not feel right (No)
A little to drink, but had a lot to say (Tell me, whoa)
Tell me who it was, tell me who it was (Tell me)
Whoever she was, she was on your mind (On your mind, oh)
You stuttered a name that didn't sound like mine (No)
This silence right now could jeopardize you and I (Tell me who)
Tell me who it was, tell me who it was (Tell me who, tell me who)

(I'll tell you how I knew)
I could feel it in your touch
Ain't lovin' good enough, no
(Baby, who's foolin' who?)
You come home tired all the time
And you don't let me get mine, no
(But before I say we're through)
She played you for a fool
She can't love you like I do
You can say what you want to
But last night you brought someone home with you
Tell me
Tell me who joined us in the bed last night (Oh)
Don't look at me crazy, it did not feel right (No, no, no)
A little to drink, but had a lot to say
Tell me who it was, tell me who it was (Tell me)
Whoever she was, she was on your mind (On your mind, oh)
You stuttered a name that didn't sound like mine (Who)
This silence right now could jeopardize you and I
Tell me who it was, tell me who it was
Tell me who joined us in the bed last night
Don't look at me crazy, it did not feel right
A little to drink, but had a lot to say
Tell me who it was, tell me who it was
Whoever she was, she was on your mind
You stuttered a name that didn't sound like mine
This silence right now could jeopardize you and I
