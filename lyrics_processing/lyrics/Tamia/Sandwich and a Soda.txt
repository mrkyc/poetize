Spend spend
Spend the night
That's what I'm talking bout boy
I'm just saying
And I ain't playin'
It ain't like that with me when we be layin', oh oh
Let me love you
You're looking tired of these basic levels, ooh
And I know there's several
You got the highest
You don't got to settle

See I'm the type of girl
To kill to love you down
Like you can be the king
And I'll bring you your crown
Like shimmy shimmy coco puff
Shimmy shimmy plow
Me and you on the ground
Baby now

If you wanna ride these curves
Hop in your Chevy Nova
And if your gonna drive with nerve
Baby I'ma be your chauffeur, oh
See I can make you feel good
And when it's all over
I'ma fluff your pillow baby
Bring you a sandwich and a soda
Be my lover
I dig you hard like a metal shovel
They don't shine, I could be your gold
You had okay, let me give you better
You might also like
See I'm the type of girl
To kill to love you down
Like you can be the king
And I'll bring you your crown
Like shimmy shimmy coco puff
Shimmy shimmy plow
Me and you on the ground
Baby now

If you wanna ride these curves
Hop in your Chevy Nova
And if your gonna drive with nerve
Baby I'ma be your chauffeur
See I can make you feel good
And when it's all over
I'ma fluff your pillow baby
Bring you a sandwich and a soda
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh
Yeah
Cause if you wanna ride these curves
Hop on this Chevvy Nova
And if you gonna drive with nerve
Baby I'ma be your chauffeur
See I can make you feel good baby
And when it's all over
I'mma fluff your pillow baby
Bring you a sandwich and a soda
