Oh, Carole with an E
She's the finest trucker I have ever seen
Though only five-foot-three
You might say that she's the highway queen
In her big rig, haulin' freight
All the way trom Santa Fe to New Orleans
She's a long haulin', diesel burnin', road doggin' machine
Carole with an E

Oh, Carole with an E
She used to live right next door to me
But she'd roll home in style
And I knew she'd be back in town a while
'Cause her man stayed at home
Brewin' bathtub moonshine all alone
He's a chain smokin', reefer tokin' billy goat and he
Loves Carole with an E

She ain't afraid of any grade
She's doin' her thing in the left-hand lane
There ain't no town clown gonna slow her down
Or rain on her parade
In pearls and kitten heels
She'll slam that hammer down on eighteen wheels
Red Sovine blastin', everlastin', how I'd like to be
Like Carole with an E

She ain't afraid of any grade
She's doin' her thing in the left-hand lane
There ain't no town clown gonna slow her down
Or rain on her parade
In pearls and kitten heels
She'll slam that hammer down on eighteen wheels
Red Sovine blastin', everlastin', how I'd like to be
Like Carole with an E
Red Sovine blastin', everlastin', how I'd like to be
Like Carole with an E

Breaker 1-9, this is the canary from the prairie
Haulin' two hundred head of frou-frou Nubian goats
Mile marker 1, right by Texola
I'm west-bound just a-gettin' it, do you copy?
10-4, come on
This is Carole with an E in a little pink freight shaker
Got the C&W comin' on nice and clear on that old radio, thank God for that
You got a clean shot all the way to OKC
Look out for them swervy pervys around about Elk City
You can back off the hammer once you hit Sayre
