When they threw me out
I heard the slammin' of familiar swingin' doors
And as I stumbled 'cross that parkin' lot gravel
Heard 'em say don't come around anymore
I'll have to find a new place for my boozin'
Those uptight highbrows don't know what they're losin'
My last cold one on them has been drank
The bar should say thanks

The bar should say thanks
For all the good times I brought with me
Even when my mind was a total blank
I was the life of the party
Before me, it was just a quiet place
A couple of guys cryin' along with Hank
Now it's the happenin' place to be
And it's all because of me
The bar should say thanks

Don't they remember each closin' time
Whose tab is always open?
And who can they always count on
To hold the hand of a friend who's barely copin'?
Who's the queen of rehashing her hard knocks
Who drops all her spare cash in the jukebox
When I could have been puttin' it in the bank
The bar should say thanks

Who'll they wake up each night when they turn on the lights?
Tell me, what do they think they're gonna do without me
Who'll leave the parkin' lot last when they're takin' out the trash?
They'll be lost without my bar room philosophy
I guess l'll be lost too to be totally frank

The bar should say thanks
For all the good times I brought with me
Even when my mind was a total blank
I was the life of the party
Before me, it was just a quiet place
A couple of guys cryin' along with Hank
Now it's the happenin' place to be
