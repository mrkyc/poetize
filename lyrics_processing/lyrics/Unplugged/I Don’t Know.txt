Ooooh, yeah (CMB don't twist it, don't tangle it)

She looks like any other girl that I seen from place to place
But I know she not like any other girl
'Cause I couldn't take my eyes off her
She had a cowboy hat (What else), a sun-greased tan (What else), pants with the ass just right
Now I can tell that me and her are gonna make a baby, a baby tonight

I don't know why she's affectin' me
Or why this situation's stressing me
I don't know why nobody's callin' me
It makes me wanna give her all of me
And now she's asking what I want it, how I want it
Where I want it, and when I want it
And what I want
Somebody tell me what's going on, going on

Now it's time to make my approach 'cause its almost two 'o clock  (Bling, bling)
But I gotta do it now 'cause I'ma get mine when I hit the parking lot
She said I know your name, I know what you do, not impressed by the things you got (Yeah right)
But I ain't gonna lie, yeah I wanna ride, so baby lick the spot

Where I want it, and when I want it
And what I want
Somebody tell me what's going on, going on

She looks like any other girl
But not like any other girl
I can tell by when she looked at me
She wanted me, and it's not the green
Now I wanna make her mine (What)
I gonna waste no time (What)
I wanna know if you want me like I want you (Listen, Weezy, come on, now)

Now as walk up in the club, It's real dark up in the club
But, and what, my diamonds still spark up in the club
I see a biznite in the corner, by midnight I'ma own her
Say what, your name is Sonya? Pshh, bet I bone her
I'm going to get rid of this last bag of marijuana
So won't ya come outside with me, how bout you take this ride with me
It's gravy so we hop in the no top, four dot
She fasten it like, "Ooh, this car is so hot", she got
And we stopped over at the Ramada
And I got her to come out of all that prada
And jump right on, and just swallow
And swallow and drain damn she wild
Make a trick holler, "Lil' Wayne!" Damn she loud, now
It's all over 'cause I'm finished with mine
Would tell her I'll call her tomorrow but, then I'd be lying
But that's all in pimpin' baby, and pimpin' is me
Hot Boy Wheezy-Whee, what
I don't know why she's affectin' me
Or why this situation's stressing me
I don't know why nobody's callin' me
It makes me wanna give her all of me
And now she's asking what I want it, how I want it
Where I want it, and when I want it
And what I want
Somebody tell me what's going on, going on
I don't know why she's affectin' me
Or why this situation's stressing me
I don't know why nobody's callin' me
It makes me wanna give her all of me
And now she's asking what I want it, how I want it
Where I want it, and when I want it
And what I want
Somebody tell me what's going on, going on

Look, Unplugged, Lil Weezy
CMB doin' it one more time
You know from Philly to the N.O
Don't twist it and tangle it
They don't understand, it's like the hottest of the hot
