Like something from a dream
I don't believe every tail right now
But you could make me believe
You're all I've ever wanted
Everything I loved to be
I might believe that your my soul mate
But with you, I feel complete
But baby I've got issues
I'm tearing at the seams
Baby, I've got issues
You should stay away from me
My heart is too broken
To give you what you need
Baby, I've got issues
I've got issues
You should stay away
You should stay away
I've been thinking 'bout you
I'd like to  have a talk with god
Maybe he sent you down here he picked himself to heal my hurting heart
But you deserve better
In time that's what you'll see
How can someone feel so empty?
Give you all of me

You make me feel so damn beautiful, you do
You, you make me think about the rest of my life with you, it's true
You make me feel so damn beautiful, you do
But everyone that I love leaves
Baby, I've got issues
I'm tearing at the seams
Baby, I've got issues
You should stay away from me
My heart is too broken
To give you what you need
Baby, I've got issues

I'm no good, I'm no good, I'm no good
You should stay away
You should, you should, you should
Should, stay away
I'm no good, I'm no good, I'm no good
But you make me feel so damn beautiful
You do, it's true
But you make me feel so damn beautiful
