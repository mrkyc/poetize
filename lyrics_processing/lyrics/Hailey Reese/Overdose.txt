I wanted you laced in my oxygen
I won't move until I get more of you
And your a snake coiled back
Dangerous but I wanna grab
I can't move
I don't have a good excuse
Ooo
And maybe I love you
Well maybe I need to get a clue
The more burns that I find the more I find that I'm hot for you
Just wanna knock you up one more time
And mine your heart through to nine
I can't get over what you do
I can't get over
How you melt be wrong inside
Like a kaleidoscope you mesmerize
If its the last thing I do
I wanna overdose
Overdose on you
Overdose on you
Overdose I wanna overdose
You might also likeOne touch and my world it spins
So come back last to the top again
I want you
Cus' baby you a 100 proof
Ooo
And maybe I love you
Well maybe I need to get a clue
The more burns the more I find that I'm hotter for you
Just wanna knock you up one more time
And mine your heart through to nine
I can't get over what you do
I can't get over
How you melt me wrong inside
Like a kaleidoscope, you mesmerize
If its the last thing I do
I wanna overdose
Overdose on you
Overdose on you
Overdose
I wanna overdose
Overdose on you
Overdose on you
Overdose
I wanna overdose
Ain't no air to doubt that I'm strong enough
Ain't no magic words that can get me off
I just need some more baby gimme some
Got me in too deep losing all control
Don't tell me that you I Don't wanna know
I won't give you up til my heart is
Just wanna knock you up one more time
And mine you heart through to nine
I can't get over what you do
I can't get over
How you melt me wrong inside
Like a kaleidoscope you mesmerize
If its the last thing I do
I wanna overdose
Overdose on you
Overdose on you
Overdose
