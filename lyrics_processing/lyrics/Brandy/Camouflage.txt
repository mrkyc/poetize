Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I

I'm a work in progress
I'm a seed growin' into a flower
I'm a storm that's risin'
And gettin' stronger with every hour
And God knows I ain't perfect
Tell me, who in the world is?
All I know is that I'm searchin'
For somebody to love me with...

These flaws I've got
They're a part of who I am
Take me or not, but I finally understand
That I'm so done tryna be everything you want
And I had to stop
'Cause baby, you ain't worth it
If I gotta camouflage for love, for love
No, I won't camouflage for love, for love
I won't camouflage
You might also like
I need a lot of improvement
Not even halfway to destiny
But I'm a train that's movin'
And every day, I'm pickin' up speed
And God knows you ain't perfect
So who are you to put pressure on me?
That's why I'm still searchin'
For somebody to love me with...

These flaws I've got
They're a part of who I am
Take me or not, but I finally understand
That I'm so done tryna be everything you want
And I had to stop
'Cause baby, you ain't worth it
If I gotta camouflage for love, for love (No, not anymore)
No, I won't camouflage for love, for love
I won't camouflage

I've learned from my mistakes
The only way you're gonna be happy
Is if someone's down to take
Take you when it's good and it's made you see
I tried givin' half of me
In the end, I came up empty
And that's why I'm searchin', yeah
For somebody to love me with these flaws
These flaws I've got (Yeah)
They're a part of who I am
Take me or not, but I finally understand (Understand)
That I'm so done tryna be everything you want (Everything you've wanted)
And I had to stop
'Cause baby, you ain't worth it
If I gotta camouflage
These flaws I've got (Oh)
They're a part of who I am (Ah)
Take me or not, but I finally understand (Yeah, yeah)
That I'm so done tryna be everything you want (And I'm so done trying, yeah yeah yeah)
And I had to stop (Whoa-oh)
'Cause baby, you ain't worth it
If I gotta camouflage for love, for love (If I gotta, if I gotta, if I gotta)
No, I won't camouflage for love, for love (If I gotta, if I gotta, if I gotta)
I won't camouflage

Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah (If I gotta camouflage, yeah-yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah (Oh, whoa-ooh-oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah (Oh, oh, oh-ooh-ooh-oh)
'Cause baby, you ain't worth it
If I gotta camouflage
Oh, I
Yeah, yeah-eah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-eah, yeah-eah, yeah-hey
Baby, you ain't worth it
