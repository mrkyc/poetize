I know that it's late
And maybe I shouldn't be so into you
It's just that tonight
I am so taken, I'm fallin' for you
When I look in your eyes, I can see a million possibilities
And I know you'll be leaving me soon, but tonight

Come a little bit closer
Let me hold you, baby
I will be good to you
And we can try to forget tomorrow
And make it last forever tonight

So if you must go
Know that I'll be missing you, wishing you closer, whoa-oh
So let's make the most of these moments together
We'll never forget
And it's breaking my heart
'Cause I know that tomorrow you'll be miles away
And I catch myself wanting so much more tonight
Come closer

Come a little bit closer
Let me hold you, baby
I will be good to you
And we can try to forget tomorrow
And make it last forever tonight

So if you're leaving me now (Leaving me now)
Baby, I don't know how I will ever get over you (Over you)
Because you opened my eyes to this love that's inside
(Opened my eyes)
Oh baby, baby, don't ever leave me

Come a little bit closer
Let me hold you, baby
I will be good to you
And we can try to forget tomorrow
And make it last forever tonight (Need you in my life)
Come a little bit closer
Let me hold you, baby (I need you here with me)
I will be good to you
And we can try to forget tomorrow
And make it last forever tonight
Come a little bit closer
Let me hold you, baby
I will be good to you
And we can try to forget tomorrow
And make it last forever tonight
Come a little bit closer (I need you here with me)
Let me hold you, baby
I will be good to you (Baby)
And we can try to forget tomorrow (We can, oh, whoa)
