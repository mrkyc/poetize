I ain't gettin' no younger
So boy, when I say love
I don't say it just to say love
I know better
If you never showed love
Don't think I woulda known love
Gotta put it in my song, love
And sing it over and over

I told my mother that I love ya
My brother asked where I met ya
Said I saw you last Tuesday on the
Corner of 1st and Love
I heard ya, whistlin' my favorite song
When I saw ya that morning on the
Corner of 1st and Love

Right there, right there, oh
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there, right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

My heart was beating like a bass drum
I heard Cupid in my ear
He said he never saw better
I gave him a straight shot
And it hit me like a moving truck
I howled like an animal
But it never felt so good
You might also like
I told my mother that I love ya
And Ray-J asked where I met ya
Said I saw you last Tuesday on the
Corner of 1st and Love
I heard ya, whistlin' my favorite song
When I saw ya that morning on the
Corner of 1st and Love

Right there (right there), right there (right there), oh (oh)
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there (standing right there), right there
(Saw my baby right there)
On the corner of 1st and Love

This ain't serendipity, no
Know that it's meant to be love
Don't feel like luck to me (luck to me), no
Know that it had to be love

Like our names carved on a tree
The memories inside of me
Don't know how long forever is
Would you stay with me and find out with me?
Oh, if the sun don't rise for weeks
Baby, that's alright with me
I can't add to infinity
But if you stay with me, you can count on me, oh
Right there (I saw him right there), right there (oh), oh
(I saw at 1st and Love, when I saw my baby)
And I wanna sing it to the world (oh, whoa)
He's right there (right there), right there (right there)
On the corner of 1st and Love

I saw you by the street signs
Oh I, I saw you by the street signs
They read 1st and Love
