Brokenhearted
Ooh-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah yeah yeah
Oh-whoa
Oh, oh-oh

I'm young, but I'm wise enough to know
That you don't fall in love overnight, oh yeah
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right

But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love, "Goodbye"
But I guess I'm

Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

No more cryptic conversations
Next time I will be totally sure, oh yeah
Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure, ooh-oh

And remember each time I cry
That I guess I'm
