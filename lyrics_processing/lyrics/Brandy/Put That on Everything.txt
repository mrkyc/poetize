If you're looking to find
A love that will stand till the end of time
Baby, relax your mind
My love is here, yeah-yeah
I'll do everything, I swear
I'll take the pain and the hurt
You won't know it's there
Wants will be nothing
I'll put that on everything, put that on everything

I will pull a star out of the sky for you
Yes, I would
To the edge of the earth, I'll go to see you
Yes, it's true
If you're anywhere, and I'm not there
Just think one thought of love
And I'll appear, oh baby

If you're looking to find
A love that will stand till the end of time (till the end of time)
Baby, relax your mind (relax your mind)
My love is here (my love is here), yeah-yeah (yeah)
I'll do everything, I swear
I'll take the pain and the hurt (and the hurt too)
You won't know it's there (you won't know it's there)
Wants will be nothing
I'll put that on everything, put that on everything

Before I dream, I lay and think of you
Every night
Honest to God, I'm tellin' you the truth
Oh yeah
I wish you can see
How much your presence means to me
You will love me so much more
Each day, oh-ooh ooh

I'll walk with you through the desert heat
I'll climb a mountain's highest peak
I'll swim forever in the deepest sea, ah
Just for you this song I sing
For all the love and joy you bring
For you, I'll try to do the impossible things
I'll put that on everything

A love that will stand till the end of time (that will stand till the end)
