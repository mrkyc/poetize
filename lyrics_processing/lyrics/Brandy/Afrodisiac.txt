Whatever you want, I got it, papi
Don't hesitate, holla at me
What I'm lookin' for is simple, you see
Love and support and sexuality
When I'm with you, I don't wanna leave
I need you just like air that I breathe
But when I'm not with you, I'm missin' a piece
I got a lot inside, need to release

You fulfill my every desire
When I'm with you, you take me higher (Ooh-whoo)

You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin' (Oh, yeah)
When I go, I'll come back
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'
You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin'
When I go, I'll come back (Oh, yeah)
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin'

There is no way you'll be gettin' away
I need your love every day
Medicine can't cure the way that I feel
What I need is not in a pill
Bein' without you, it's makin' me ill
It's stressin' me out, I need to chill
Somethin' this strong has gotta be real
Nothin' or no one can show my skills, oh
You might also like
You fulfill my every desire
(Oh yes, you did)
When I'm with you, you take me higher (Oh, you are)

You're my afrodisiac (Yes, you are)
You're the only one I'm needin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I go (When I go), I'll come back (I'll come back)
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin' (You are, are)
You're my afrodisiac (I need you)
You're the only one I'm needin' (Don't go)
When I go, I'll come back (Yes, I'll come back)
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin' (No way)

I admit that I'm a prisoner of your sex appeal (Sex appeal)
And I can't seem to find a way to escape how I feel (How I feel)
I can't wait no longer, please come give a dose to me (Dose to me)
The craving's getting stronger, I need you now, close to me

You're my afrodisiac
You're the only one I'm needin' (You're the only)
When I go, I'll come back (When I go, I'll come back)
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin' (Oh, yeah)
You're my afrodisiac (Yes, you are)
You're the only one I'm needin' (I'm needin')
When I go, I'll come back (Oh, I'll come back)
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin' (You're my afro)
You're my afrodisiac (You're the only one)
You're the only one I'm needin' (I'm needin')
When I go, I'll come back (I will come back)
'Cause there is no way I'm leavin' (You're my)
You're my afrodisiac (Yes, you are)
You're the only one I'm needin' (Needin', oh)
When I go, I'll come back (Oh, I'll come back)
