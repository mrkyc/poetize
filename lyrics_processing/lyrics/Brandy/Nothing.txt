Hey, love is everything
And without it, I'm nothing (Nothing, nothing)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Nobody knows the pain I feel
Nobody knows, but it's for real
I can feel it (Yeah, yeah), I do
Nobody knows that I miss you
Nobody knows, but it's the truth
I can feel it (Yeah, yeah), I do

You cannot pretend that I don't even matter
You and I know better
You've been away from me for too long
It's time for you to come on home
No one can say what is right for me
They don't have to live my life
I need for you to come on over
I'll be waiting

I am nothing without you, baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone
Nothing without you, baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone
You might also like
No one can see inside of me
No one can see how much I care
I need you (Yeah, yeah), I do
Nobody sees the tears I cry
No one is there to dry my eyes
I need you (Yeah, yeah), I do

You cannot pretend that I don't even matter
You and I know better
You've been away from me for too long
It's time for you to come on home, yeah
No one can say what is right for me
They don't have to live my life
I need for you to come on over
I'll be waiting

'Cause I am nothing without you, baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone
Nothing without you, baby
(Nothing without you here with me)
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
(Can't be without you, can't be without you, can't live without you)
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone
I don't care what they say about you
They don't know how I feel for you
I don't care what they say about me
They don't know and they can't see
I am...

Nothing without you, baby (Nothing)
It's driving me (And it's driving me, yeah, yeah)
I'm so alone, I'm so alone
Nothing without you
You're driving me crazy, you're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy
I want you in my life, I do
You showed me what your love can do
And for that I'm so, so thankful for you
So thankful for you
I'm so alone

Nothing without you, baby
Nothing, it's driving me crazy
Nothing, no one, I'm so alone

I need you in my life, I need you in my life right now
I need you in my life, I need you in my life right now
Don't you leave me baby, baby
Don't you leave me, never leave me, never leave me
I need you in my life, I need you in my life right now
I need you in my life, I need you in my life right now
Don't you leave me baby, baby
