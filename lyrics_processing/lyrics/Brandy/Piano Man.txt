Do you have a request book handy I could flip through?
"I do," he said, "My name is Rodney, good to meet you."
"What do you wanna hear tonight?", he asked me
I said, "Something I can feel inside," oh-whoa
"I got what you need, I know exactly...
Why don't we give this a try?"

He played a song filled with sadness, I believed him, oh-whoa

He was goin' for hours, people cryin' showers
No one ever really tells how it is
I sang about hopeless, 'cause everyone knows it, knows it
And it was so honest
Finally breathin' some clean air, been through it and seen that
I've witnessed all the pain, oh
And as the spotlight was fadin', he just kept on playin', oh-whoa
