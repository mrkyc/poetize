I didn't notice the signs
You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yellin', "damn, she's blind"
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yellin', "Not the space

I could say that I knew the whole time, but I would be lyin'
You'd have to be a hidden camera, recordin' each take of cryin'
I would say that I would just go to your part, to stop the taping
But the end's here, and I can't change it

The suspense is buildin'
Sittin' on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickenin'
I was hangin' off the cliff, love
You said it's a surprise, what's the surprise ending?

You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missin' it, homeboys visitin')
The audience yellin', "yeah, that's right"
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me
Don't buy you were gone
Stopped goin' through your phone
The audience yellin', "'bout damn time"

Everything was okay when I was the victim
Had me made out to be so naive
Never knew I was workin' on a masterpiece
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
So now as the credits roll
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds
