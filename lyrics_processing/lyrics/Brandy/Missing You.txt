Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find a way to get through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by

Who would've known, that you'd have to go
So suddenly, so fast?
How could it be that sweet memories
Would be all, all that we'd have left?

And now that you're gone, every day I go on (I go on)
But life's just not the same (Life's just not the same)
I'm so empty inside, and my tears I can't hide
But I'll try, I'll try to face the pain

Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find a way to get through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by
You might also like
Oh, there was so many things (Mmm, mmm, hmm)
That we could have shared, uh-huh (We could've shared, yeah)
If time was on our side (If time was on our side)
Ooh, yeah

Now that you're gone, I can still feel you near (Oh, still)
So I'll smile, with every tear I cry (I cry)

Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find a way to go through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by

How sweet
We were the closest of friends (Ooh, yeah)
But I'll wait for the day (Ooh, mmm)
When I'll see you again
See you again
Yeah, and I'm
(Although I'm missing you)
But I'll find a way to get through
(I'll find a way to get through)
Living without you
'Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
Although, I'm missing you
(I'll find a way to get through)
I'll find a way, I'll find a way, I'll find a way, hey yeah
For you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by
