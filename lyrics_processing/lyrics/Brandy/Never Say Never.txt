Who would have ever thought a guy
Would want a girl like me?
Who would ever thought that I
Would fall so easily?
Who would ever have thought that we
Would finally come to be?
I guess they just don't know
How much you mean to me
Who would ever thought that they
Would have some words to say?
We'll go on anyway
It's alright, it's okay
Take what ever comes our way
Together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never

I can't believe they'd stop our happiness
By tryna pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out of all this crazy madness?
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

Now baby, they can't believe that (They can't)
You and me are together
That's why they should have never
Never said never (Yeah)
There were times when we thought that (Thought that)
You and me could never be together
That's why we should have never
Never said never, never said never

Who would have ever thought a guy

Would have some words to say? (Much to say)
We'll go on anyway
It's alright, it's okay
Take what ever comes our way
Together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never
Now there's a lot of talking goin' 'round
About the way me and you gettin' down
What, are they jealous? Are they hatin' me?
I guess they all have their own PhD's
I wish that they would just stop sweatin' me
Stop tryna get the best of me
No matter what they say, baby
We gotta move on 'cause we're gonna be happy

We didn't let the thoughts that we had (No, no)
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never (Yeah, yeah)
Simple (Simple) for me to see when (See when)
Never would've been never if allowed
Now that we are together
Never say never, never say never
