Off the train tracks
I can slow it down (Whoa)
Just when you think you're 'bout to turn back
Scared you might crash
I'll be your ground (Whoa, hey)

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears are dry from cryin'
And the world has turned silent
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me

And the walls are closin' in

And when you feel alone, I'ma be your home
When others come and go, you know I got you
