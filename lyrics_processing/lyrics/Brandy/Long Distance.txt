There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
And I'm runnin' out of things to do to get you off my mind, oh-oh
All I have is this picture in a frame (Ah)
That I hold close to see your face every day

With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me

It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me

Now the minutes feel like hours and the hours feel like days
Whoa, while I'm away
You know right now, I can't be home
But I'm comin' home soon, comin' home soon
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face every day
You might also like
(With you)
With you is where I'd rather be (Where I'd rather be)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (Oh), you're so far (Oh)
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me (You were here with me)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (Oh), you're so far (Oh)

Can you hear me cryin'? Oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Can you hear me cryin'? Oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Can you hear me cryin'? Oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-whoa, oh
Oh-oh, oh-whoa, oh

With you is where I'd rather be (Where I'd rather be, whoa)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (So hard), you're so far (So far)
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
(I wish you were here with me, you were here with me)
But we're stuck where we are (Stuck where we are)
And it's so hard (So hard), you're so far (So far)
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
