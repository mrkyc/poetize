All I can do is sit and think about
The way you used to love me
The way you used to hold me
And the way you used to touch me
And all I want is another moment
I'm waiting, and I'm ready
Touch me

Wish I could hold you just for a little while
Let me
I wish I could see you right now, but you're so far away
It's driving me crazy
I'm missing you, baby
And the way you touch me
It's unlike anything I've ever felt before
That's how I know I am yours

Now is the time to relax your mind
Let go and unwind
I've waited for too long, I'm ready
Tonight's the night for loving you right
You know what I wanna do
I wanna give into you
You might also like
Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
And I can hardly wait 'til you touch me
How I want you so
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby
I'm gonna ask you for sure
Will you please touch me?

I'm coming to see you
I'm wearing the dress that you like
I'll be on the first plane
I'll call when I get there, I promise
I haven't been sleeping, no
I've been thinking about the way you touch me
I'm losing all self-control
Feels like I'm letting go
And I'm loving every minute

Now is the time to relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Let go and unwind
I've waited for too long, I'm ready
Tonight's the night for loving you right
You know what I wanna do
I wanna give into you, baby
Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
And I can hardly wait 'til you touch me
How I want you so
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby (Baby)
I'm gonna ask you for sure (Ask you for sure)
Will you please touch me?

I'm still here
I'm still waiting
What time are you coming?

Day and night, I'm yearning for you to touch me
I'm thinking of you only, you are my everything
Said I gotta be your lady
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you

Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
And I can hardly wait 'til you touch me
How I want you so
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby
I'm gonna ask you for sure
(Will you please touch me?) Will you please touch me?
Really miss you, baby
And ways you touch me
And I love it when you're lovin' me
And I can hardly wait 'til you touch me
And you're kissin' me
And you're huggin' me
And you're touchin' me
How I want you so
Driving me out of my mind
Yes, you are, yes you are
Thoughts of you make me lose control
Soon as I see you, baby
I'm gonna ask you for sure
And soon as I see my baby love
(Will you please touch me?) Will you please touch me?
He will touch me
Really miss you, baby
