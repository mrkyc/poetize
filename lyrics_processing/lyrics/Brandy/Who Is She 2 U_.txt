Don't even think about callin' me crazy
You know you peeped that lady, yeah, yeah
And when I turned and looked at you, you tried
To play it off, but I could tell that you two were friends
But you was just too nervous
And she was lookin' like she was hurt
Like the memory had surfaced
It kinda got her pissed off
I'm kinda wonderin' myself, and you're really no help
Tell me how you two know each other so well
'Cause I wanna know now, you better start talkin'

Who is she to you? (Yeah)
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
There's something going on between you two
Think you better let me know
That's for sure (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Don't lie)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
There's something going on between you two (Something)
Think you better let me know
That's for sure (Oh)
You might also like
No matter how hard you try, you can't hide it
There's no way you can deny it, oh, no, no
Then, you wanna flip and call me insecure
I'm only buggin' because you are so suspicious
Well, then you say I don't trust ya
Can't understand why I would cuss ya
And come off so demandin'
But baby, I can be, yeah
Don't tell me what I should not say
You're wrong in the first place
For lookin' too hard over that way
And you better tell me what the deal is, oh

Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Who is she?)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (My eyes)
There's something going on between you two
Think you better let me know

Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see
There's something going on between you two (Something going on, yeah)
Think you better let me know
That's for sure (Think you better)
Damn right, I wanna know her name
Tell me how you know her, baby
Why did she make that face?
You look so ashamed
What are you not sayin', boy?
I'm really not playin', boy
Gotta know right now
You better start explainin', boy

Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Who is she?)
Who is she to you?

That's for sure (Did you touch her?)
Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Did you love her?)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (Did you ever do her?)
There's something going on between you two

There's something going on between you two
Think you better let me know (Go on, back to her)
That's for sure
