And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you, baby
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you, baby
And I love you, baby
And I, and I love you
And I love you

An angel has always been thought
To be one of God's most precious works
I guess that's how she had you fooled
Because she was an angel in disguise
Hurt and pain could never come from her
So you left me only to find that
Hurt and pain involves her
But now you see your mistakes
And now you see your angel was a fake
But my love was never misplaced
See, baby, my love is true
And most importantly, still, I love you
(Still, I love you)

An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
You might also like
I found it quite strange
The way you said her name
And when you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny
It's more to this than what you said
'Cause in your sleep, you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then 'cause the rain began, oh-oh

An angel in disguise she was (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But somehow you fell for her (You fell for her)
And though she broke your heart that day (She broke your heart)
And left you in the rain (Yeah)
But still, I love you (Oh, I love you, baby)
An angel in disguise she was (Oh, I'm with you, baby)
But somehow you fell for her (I'm ready for you, baby)
And though she broke your heart that day (And left you in the rain)
And left you in the rain (Yeah)
But still, I love you

She seemed so familiar the day that I met her
Who was she foolin'?
I had a clue of what she was doin'
Thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention
I fell in her game, and I'm so lost
Please stop the rain, oh-ooh
An angel in disguise she was (Oh, you hurt me, babe)
But somehow you fell for her (Yeah, but I'm still here)
And though she broke your heart that day (Still lovin' you)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you (Oh, I might be crazy, babe)
An angel in disguise she was (But I love you, babe)
But somehow you fell for her (Somehow you fell)
And though she broke your heart that day (She left you in the rain)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you

And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again
And when my music stops
And when my tears dry
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again (Ooh baby, oh, darlin')

An angel in disguise she was (I know it hurts)
But somehow you fell for her (Oh-ooh)
And though she broke your heart that day (Broke your heart, oh)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you (I love you)
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her (Somehow you fell for her)
And though she broke your heart that day (She left you in the rain)
And left you in the rain
But still, I love you
I love you
I will never do the things she did
Take your heart and run away with it, no, no
'Cause I really, really love you (Still, I love you)
An angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
And though she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
