You're sorry, you're sorry (Sorry)
What would you do if you're alone? (Yeah)
Would you think about me?
I know there's something wrong with you
On my mind all the time
It is what it is
Feelin' crazy (Feelin')
Wanna be with me deep down (Deep down)
You can feel it, you can't help it, baby
I'll give you this heart of mine

Ooh
I'm on the borderline, yeah yeah (Oh)
Ooh
Don't wanna be schizo this time (Oh)
Never ever cheat, never lie to me
I'm the most jealous girl (Girl)
In the whole wide world (World)
Don't you ever hurt me
I'll change on you
I will do, me and you, how
You might also like
Cause I'm falling in love all alone (Oh, I)
Come on home
Never treat me the same, I ain't the same
I'm like nobody else
Oh (Ooh)

In the whole wide world (Don't you ever)
Don't you ever hurt me
I'll change on you (Oh, I will do)
I will do, me and you, how

I'm so dangerous, baby
I need you to see
Believe what you see
Feel what I feel
And my feelings don't die
It's why I cry (Cry)
I need to heal
Got another lady, havin' a baby
Goin' crazy, but I'll be your friend, baby
Take what I can, baby
Back then, I couldn't take no chances
Karma is a bitch, baby
Ooh
I'm on the borderline, yeah yeah (Oh)
Ooh (Ooh)
I don't wanna be schizo this time (Schizo this time, ah)
Never ever cheat, never lie to me
I'm the most jealous girl (Girl)
In the whole wide world (In the whole wide world)
Don't you ever hurt me
I'll change on you
I will do, me and you, how

Heart drops to the floor
'Cause there's no you and I
Maybe in another lifetime (Right place)
Caught me at the wrong time (Wrong time)
In the end, I'm the only one
Gon' get torn apart (Oh)
In the end, I'm the only one (That's gonna)
Gon' be torn apart

Ooh
I'm on the borderline, yeah yeah (Oh)
Ooh (Ooh)
I don't wanna be schizo this time (Ah)
Never ever cheat, never lie to me (Woo)
