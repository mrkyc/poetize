How could you lie to me
After all that we've been through?
It's just so sad to see
Me in love with you, I gave you all of me
Still, it wasn't enough for you
Is this how love's s'posed to be?
Now I'm trying to get over you

You ain't missin' me at all
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't know me, like you used to
Tell me, what is goin' on?
You got me standing here alone
You don't know me, like you used to

Oh yeah (Uh, goin' and takin' me down)
Uh, come on
Oh yeah (Brandy takin' me down)
Come on, come on
Oh yeah (No, Darkchild, I'm wit your thangs)
Come on, come on
Oh yeah (So don't tell the task, do that thang, uh uh uh)

Remember what you said
When you stepped up on the scene

Had me stressin' like a fiend
No, I just can't forget
How you put that thang on me
I wish we never met
This way I wouldn't be lonely
