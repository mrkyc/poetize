For the ladies
Holla back
(Chorus: Lil Wayne)
Hey there, mama (lady)
I'm on my way there, mama (lady)
So you should just lay there holla if ya hear me
Know ya man wanna kill me
Tell him, here I am, but damn
You are such a (lady)
Can I touch ya (lady)
Can I cut ya (lady)
I got a box of bandaids in my Escalade
I ain't playing, c'mon
(Verse 1: Mannie Fresh)
Damn the rest, I am the best
Mannie Fresh, always fresh
From the shirt to the pants stay fresh
Starburst on the wrist and the chest
I ain't drunk, I ain't dancing yet
I'm trying to get to where the ladies at
It's going down like value jets
So I pull up in my brand new red corvette
That's the one that she ain't saw yet
So she gon probably catch the wall for that
And I'm behind her, you know where I'm at
Yeah, yelling to the DJ, run that back
I gave it to her, she brung that back
An ass like that don't come like that
Go on get a couple drinks and I'ma come right back
Yup, and it was done like that
You might also like(Chorus: Lil Wayne)
Hey there, mama (lady)
I'm on my way there, mama (lady)
So you should just lay there holla if ya hear me
Know ya man wanna kill me
Tell him, here I am, but damn
You are such a (lady)
Can I touch ya (lady)
Can I cut ya (lady)
I got a box of bandaids in my Escalade
I ain't playing, c'mon
(Verse 2: Mannie Fresh)
I pull up in an Impala, homie
With the polo with the collar on it
We tell the bartender, bottles only
Now we're telling housekeeping, towels only
I get a shower on me then there's no more words
And I got no vowels on me
Got a girl in Texas that ride on ponies
We be in (?)
We do it one more time in the morning
Right before I take that drive to New Orleans
Thinking that her boyfriend is probably on me
Telling mama hold me, I'm not an opponent
I just let baby girl smoke and party
Give her little rope and we choke the moaning
And now she like lotion on me
Splash, I feel a white ocean forming
(Chorus: Lil Wayne)
Hey there, mama (lady)
I'm on my way there, mama (lady)
So you should just lay there holla if ya hear me
Know ya man wanna kill me
Tell him, here I am, but damn
You are such a (lady)
Can I touch ya (lady)
Can I cut ya (lady)
I got a box of bandaids in my Escalade
I ain't playing, c'mon
(Verse 3: Mannie Fresh)
So what you wanna do?
Girl, I got a pocket full of Magnums
And Weezy Baby do, too
Dodge Magnum, grand blue, boo
Baby fresh ...(?)
And I'm fresh like a new suit
Stepping out make the bitches go goof troop
You know, fruit loop
And if I'm ever down in St. Lou
Put your girl in a rain suit (ha-HA)
Now I'm going to see my California angel
She drank cardis and she gang bang, too
And I just tell her, do your thang, boo
As long as I keep Chuck Taylors on them ankles
And when I'm on the east coast
I be lying to them broads like Pete Rose
Mannie Fresh, tighter than some speedos
I love women, but I hate these hoes
(Chorus: Lil Wayne)
Hey there, mama (lady)
I'm on my way there, mama (lady)
So you should just lay there holla if ya hear me
Know ya man wanna kill me
Tell him, here I am, but damn
You are such a (lady)
Can I touch ya (lady)
Can I cut ya (lady)
