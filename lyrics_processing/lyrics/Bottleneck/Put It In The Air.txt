Put your trunk in the air
Put your drink in the air

Put your middle finger up like you just don't care (Yessir)
Put it in the air

Put your truck in the air
Put your drink in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put that mother trucker up like you just don't care (Yessir)

Put it up for my country folks, way down them old dirt roads
Orange blaze we keep it hot and yeah we got gun control
Big old truck, eight point buck
Sippin' shine, solo cup
That's how we roll us country folks we keep it crunk
Deep in the hood, way in the woods
Rowdy on them Friday nights
Put it in the air we got lift kits on cold bud lights
Some outcast white trash way back rebel flag
Camouflage wearin' country folk with some southern swag
Yes sir we all of that, twelve pack and trucker hats
Pure white trash, Bottleneck is on the map
Swoll like a buck and rut, pimp like a turkey strut
When I see eyes in the field my scope, I put it up
Bonafide super cracker certified country boy
Fifty-five inches, tractor tires on Tonka toys
We keep it in the sky, we keep it ridin' high
You know we keep it lifted until the day we die

Put it in the air I keep it fly like an eagle
I took the track when it's hot like a beagle
I bust the briar block, buckwild if you're not
Let's put the fire in the air I got a lot of knock
Come on get high with me
They call me the breeze
I got the heart of a buck, big buck on my sleeve
You crackers love me now
I'm high above the ground
We got fifty-five inches, the hole can't bog us down
You know I'm country dog, the realest in the game
I got a little fame and I'll never change
I put my drink in the air at the mud bog
You best believe I still get dirty with y'all
I'm just a southern boy stuck in my southern ways
I got the hundred proof lifted runnin' through my veins
Shot guns and nuts hangin' off the hitches
Dirty ditches mouth full of Grizzly's
