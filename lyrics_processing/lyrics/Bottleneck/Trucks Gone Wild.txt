Trucks gone wild, they stay jacked up
Trucks gone wild, keep slingin' that mud
Trucks gone wild, better lock them hubs
Trucks gone wild, don't never get stuck
Trucks gone wild, they stay jacked up
Trucks gone wild, keep slingin' that mud
Trucks gone wild, better lock them hubs
Trucks gone wild, don't never get stuck

Truck real high, high in the sky
Trucks gone wild, you know you wanna ride
Big ol' tires deep in a mud pit
Watch out 'cause I spray with this mud grips
Straight from the woods country boy, big block
Snatch rope with a big ol' mud knot
20 foot rooster tail, mud rut rider
We done road high, but now we're ridin' higher
Never get stuck in the deepest of mud
Got a six foot ladder to get in my truck
Trucks gone wild, they love to get loose
And they rock every pit that they trucks run through
Hit the hole on go, we here to party
Man drive her easy, no not hardly
Trucks gone wild they just keep on truckin'
Pack up the cooler and let's go muddin'

Mud fun, big truck, let's go to the hole
Redneck girls up and down them stripper poles
Hell yeah buddy, hey looky there
That damn truck's 30 foot in the air
Big winch, I pull out like a fat fish
And this here is a party you can't miss
Trucks gone wild, they play dirty
Mud slingin' everywhere, beer goggles blurry
Big trucks beefed up in and out of mud ruts
Mack tough, never stuck, keep doin' donuts
What's up? I think trucks gone wild
And I keep thinkin' which hole Ima dive in
As long as my tires spin and make the mud sling
We'll make a truck out of damn near anything
Bottleneck "Trucks Gone Wild" and them Jawga Boyz
High in a pit, yes sir, we makin' big noise
Trucks gone wild, they stay jacked up
Trucks gone wild, keep slingin' that mud
Trucks gone wild, better lock them hubs
Trucks gone wild, don't never get stuck
Trucks gone wild, they stay jacked up
Trucks gone wild, keep slingin' that mud
Trucks gone wild, better lock them hubs
Trucks gone wild, don't never get stuck

These are big ol' trucks that make noise
Clumps of mud fallin' like some asteroids
Jawga Boyz, we here to have some fun
With some jacked up trucks underneath the sun
Yeah, y'all better get ready, it's time to get it right
'Cause when I hit the pit the mud'll take flight
I pull out with a brand new paint job
They say I stole the show like a bank rob
Fifty-six inch tractor tires
If I get first place Ima jack it higher
Hell why not, it's all that I've got
So while I'm still hot I'll keep it on top
You won't find these trucks in the road
Unless they're in tow on the way to a show, so
If you're lookin' for trucks that went wild
Follow the convoy we ridin' in style
Trucks gone wild, they stay jacked up
Trucks gone wild, keep slingin' that mud
Trucks gone wild, better lock them hubs
Trucks gone wild, don't never get stuck
Trucks gone wild, they stay jacked up
Trucks gone wild, keep slingin' that mud
Trucks gone wild, better lock them hubs
