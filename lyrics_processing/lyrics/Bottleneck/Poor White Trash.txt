See if y'all was born like me then y'all bleed like me
That's right
That's right

I'm poor white trash I was raised down here
P-p-poor white trash I was raised down here
I'm poor white trash I was raised down here, down here
Come on get it
C-c-come on get it
I'm poor white trash I was raised down here
P-p-poor white trash I was raised down here
I'm poor white trash I was raised down here, down here
Come on get it
C-c-come on get it

Born in the bottom they labeled me an imperfection
But let me tell you a little something, my own impression
I'm still stressin' on what I seen in adolescence
A lethal weapon, I fly my flag I still rep it
A sole survivor and showin' mercy is for the weak
But let 'em bleed for condemning me for being me
The same bitches who labeled me is on they knees
They split between praising me and jealousy

Well let a cracker fly or please give me death
Cause Ima keep it real to the end until there's nothing left
I'm still blowin' in the pine trees when I'm dead and gone
'Cause I got poor white trash that's bangin' my song
So come get it if you want to, you bunch of bitches
You know who I belong to I represent it
I was raised down here and ain't nothing to me
You can find me where the rebel flag blows in the breeze
