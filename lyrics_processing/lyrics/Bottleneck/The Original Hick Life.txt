Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up a-doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar, swimin' in a water hole
Livin' this hick life wild as a rodeo
Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up a-doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' that jar, swim in that water hole
Livin' this hick life wild like a rodeo

Country boy hick life, white tee, rebel flag
Catch me dirt road ridin' John Deere Cadillac
Just a country boy living like my Pappi said
Hustlin' these fields cause I gotta keep the family fed
Hit the back road pick a case of firewater up
Mamas keep 'em close cause I might pick your daughter up
Hick life boy with a redneck attitude
Daddy got me in the right, Pops here's my gratitude
Stayin' on the trail, you can call me a huntin' dog
Big country boy keep it hotter than a fire log
Keep that grease hot, now I'm squeakin' like a wild hog
Lit the K3 puff, puff like the mornin' fog
Drinking on the farm no we don't even need a bar
Hick life, drinkin' shine straight from a Mason jar
Double wide thick smoke hick life you feelin' it?
Big country white boy backwoods killin' it

Raise 'em up for the South one more time
You know we from the woods but we still on the grind
Got my double-aught buck, 'bout to take that aim
You know the hick life, 'bout to kill that game
We the P.I.M.P. southern supreme
Still baked, getin' biscuits with my homegrown team
Croppin' the green, the cattle we got 'em
If you want a snow  come straight to the bottom
Gotta dig in the dirt just to find my bone
Gotta dig in these wrongs and you can find my chrome
Moved on from bailin' hay to makin' country tunes
Big Smo and Dubblewide, we lettin' it loose
Kickin' Rama boots, drinkin' and suds
Country livin' hick life that's what's up
Hop in the hog pen stank on my boots
Hick life, country style, with the southern roots, yeah

True south living, welcome to the country y'all
Born in the southern sticks, raised on a cattle farm
Fishin' down at Duck river, sippin' on apple pie
Smokin' cedar shrub, got me feelin' super fine
Keep a couple super dime home grown cuties
Their prize winnin' fairground Tennessee beauties
With a Boston butt booties slow cooked and seasoned
Lift a skirt like a mud buggy, give me one reason
I swear no teasin' I take 'em down a dirt road
Straight through an open field where the moonlight glows
Skinny dippin' in the pond underneath the open sky
Frog gig chicken on the bank with them super dimes
Damnit boy I'm super high, K3 Kush
Rubbin' dock hit the spot like High School nookie
I'm a monster out the cage you can call me Honky Kong
Big boss of the sticks and I'm hick life strong, come on
Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up a-doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' from a jar, swimin' in a water hole
Livin' this hick life wild as a rodeo
Hick life raised on a dirty road
Grew up a-doin' what my daddy told
Sippin' that jar, swim in that water hole
