(What) Beer, shine, get low, shots (What)

Out in the country we know how to party
Drop the tailgate down and shake it Shawty (Damn)
Tip your cup up and yeah, drop it low now (Drop it Low)
Out at the honey hole we 'bout to throw down (Yes sir)
Out in the country we know how to party
Drop the tailgate down and shake it Shawty
Tip your cup up and yeah drop it low now
Out at the honey hole we 'bout to throw down

12 gauge automatic, country twerkin' workin' at it
Throwin' down fill your cup, snipe huntin' ride them ruts
Take that little tractor trail down past the skinnin' rack
And if you on a beer run shut the gate and lock the latch
Country is what country do, corn whiskey ninety proof
Gettin' loose with Florida Georgia Line, we can let it cruise
I'm down at the honey hole we raise some hell and waller
Shawty lookin' so fine dancin' on them boggers (Damn)
Drop the tailgate down get your drinks in the sky (Put 'em up)
Yessir we gettin' right 'til late in the night (Yeehaw)
Everybody's feelin' fine the party's gettin' rowdy
Out in the country you know we 'bout it 'bout it

Raisin' hell, rebel yell, yes sir we live it up
Gettin' loose off the chain in the boondocks bangin' Hank
Barefooted country girls they sweet like some sugar cane (Oh lawd)
Tailgate dropped down keg just got tapped
We keep that thing jumpin' like some frogs in a cul de sac
We keep it hell yeah yeehaw we sayin' it with southern drawl
One things for sure in the country we party y'all
Drink a little beer and sip a little shine (Oh yeah)
Yeah we get our buzz on all the damn time (All the damn time)
Red blooded country folk a hundred proof homegrown
