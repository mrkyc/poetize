Yeah
It's that time of year again
It's time to get them dogs in a box
Get up early on the weekend
Get out there in the woods
Find yourself the old big buck
Maybe put him on your wall or something
Y'all know what I'm talkin' about

Have you ever dumped a box on a big old buck
Have you ever knocked the mirror off your brand new truck
Have you ever left the dogs in the woods for days
And hit the only water hole sideways
Have you ever dumped a box on a big old buck
Have you ever knocked the mirror off your brand new truck
Have you ever left the dogs in the woods for days

Got the puppy dog ready 'bout to bust the gate
Five o'clock in the mornin' and I can't be late
I got a fresh bag of chew up in my dash
I gotta stop at the store for some beer and some gas
'Cause I'm ready for a buck chase, hell yeah
I make my own no days, hell yeah
Got an old shotgun full of three inch mags
And an old lemon dog that can damn sure track
Let 'em jump in the pine rows, let's go
Gotta get there quick 'cause he done crossed the old cut through
Yessir got my boot on the gas
And my whole pack of dogs is burnin' his ass
We swervin' through the pine trees yessir
They yellin' on the CB, if you hear  word
We ridin' through the woods dogs lightin' him up
That's how we do it the cut when we runnin ' a buck

Posted on the dog box I gotta get 'em done
I'm good for a hundred yards on the run
Them puppy dogs talkin' comin' up the hill
I got my hand on the trigger and I'm ready to spill
I got the whole row covered at a hundred yards
But them big old bucks are damn sure smart
He done seen us and he turned back
The big rack was bouncin in them black jacks and tall grass
Made a runnin' to the camp row cut 'em off
We can't let the big boy mossy cross
I hope we hit the big deer cut hammerin' down
'Cause my double-aught buck 'bout to knock him down
Dumped the whole damn box to hell with it
If he cross into the big swamp we'll go get 'em
Live and let die at the big old buck
That's how we do it in the club when we runnin' them ruts
