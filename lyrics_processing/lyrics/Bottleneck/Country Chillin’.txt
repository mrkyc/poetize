Hah Charley Farley, Bottleneck That's right
Let's go, go
Country chillin' (Go, go) (Go, go)
Come on

Hell yeah we out here chillin'
Country livin' and some moonshine sippin'
Pop a top and bring it on back
I'm from the woods what you know about that
Hell yeah we out here chillin'
Country livin' and some moonshine sippin'
Pop a top and throw it on back
I'm from the woods what you know about that

When I'm out in the sticks with the BBQ pit lit
Guzzlin', funnelin' alcohol quick get, another fifth lifted
Let me sip sip it 'til I can rip rip it the rhymes with Bottleneck (Yeah)
Y'all wanna party well get off your ottoman
Out into the bottoms with nothin' but Dixie condiments
Follow me, those plastic cups plates and spoons
Laughing with friends, howlin' at the moon
Packed out back just like a cocoon
Hell yeah rap but I'm country as raccoons
Gettin' into your white bred stash at noon
You can assume I'm ill, ain't no pill that can cure me
Got a deer I killed on the hill curing
Man I must be like gas fumes
Every time I'm near a hot drink Jack I just boom

Sunnin' in the cut with the four wheeler ruts
Singin' to a Hank instrumental with a buzz
Deep in a jug hell yeah we like to party
Run like an old Ford truck with no car keys
What you know about that, where they keep the hogs at
Dog collar wrapped around my beer 'fore I get slapped
Yeah it's time to kick back out past deer tracks
Down in the woods, you know we keep it bushwhacked
Two or three six-packs mixed with the corn mash
Pop a top off your beer glass and the pine ash
A little country livin' moonshine sippin'
Yeah we gettin' tore up backwoods lifted
Dirt road cul-de-sac deep in the pine trees
I'm close to the bone and that's all I'll ever be
Out here rebel yell drinks in the air
Country folk chillin' like we just don't care
Hell yeah we out here chillin' (That's right)
Country livin' and some moonshine sippin' (Come on)
Pop a top and bring it on back
