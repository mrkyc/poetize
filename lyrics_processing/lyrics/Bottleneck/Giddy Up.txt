In the bar girl, I got beer on tap
Grab that pole baby make it clap
You a rodeo ho lemme be your clown
Lookin' at you pop it up and down
I'm sweatin' you got me twerkin'
Girl you fine as hell keep workin'
Tap the keg I'm a redneck wonder
Grind me and feel like thunder
Pop that, rock that, lock that, drop that
Daisy dukes cut real short can't top that
Nuh uh now they starin' you down
Sniffin' you out like a blue tick hound
I'm Babe Ruth baby,  let me hit it
Don't quit girl, get it, get it
Get crunk girl its a Dubblewide world

Give a dog a bone I'm Paddywack
Go 'head let loose big straw hat and them country boots
Daisy dukes cut real high
Girl get ready for a pony ride
Slip and slide on the ground
Girl get low you know you're mine
Love your eyes love your thighs
Diamonds like they make 'em nice
Giddy up girl you rock my world
Let me see you shake that pearl
Yeehaw show it off get butt naked take it off

In the woods girl  this how we do
In the barn and we gettin' loose
I'm off the chain with my redneck crew
Gridin' out in my steel toe boots
Hop in, pop it, lock it
Bounce like you ridin' the bull no stoppin'
Giddy up girl now you know what I mean
Decked out in my John Deere green
Heal toe, do-si-do
Giddy up with the Dubblewide Boys let's go
She country, he country, we country
Do what we want a free country
Drink shine straight from the jar
Deep in the cut and it's never too far
I'm a nut little girl chew me up like a squirrel

Don't stop just twerk with it
You know I'll make you split it
You heard me y'all  I said it
Giddy up girl now saddle up
Just shake that rattle up
Better yet just back it up
Them jeans are sexy cut

So sweet as a-a pumpkin

Shake yo, shake yo rump, rump
