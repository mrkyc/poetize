Every now and then we get in a rut
But we gotta keep 'em spinnin'
Gotta lock it in 4-wheel drive baby (Yessir)

Keep 'em spinnin' keep your hands on the wheel
Stay true to yourself, believe half what you hear
Real talk, gotta keep movin' on
And when the vibe ain't right you gotta leave it alone
So pop a top don't stress too much
And don't let yourself put yourself in a rut
Life might throw a little mud on your tires
You gotta kick back son and enjoy the ride

Go head pop a top, drop a tailgate
'Cause life get's a little sideways (That's right)
It might throw a little mud on your tires
But keep 'em spinning in 4-wheel drive
Pop a top, drop a tailgate
'Cause life get's a little sideways (That's right)
It might throw a little mud on your tires
But keep 'em spinning in 4-wheel drive

If you get knocked down pick yourself on up
Dust yourself on off make it through these ruts
Drop your tailgate and enjoy your view
And think about the good life that was gave to you
A couple ice cold beers make you reminisce
Make you think way back 'bout the people you miss
So let it roll and hold on tight
Keep your head held high and drink a few for the ride
