Yes Sir!
Where my dirt road riders at?

This how we do it in the country
This how we live in the woods
That's how we roll down them dirt roads
In the country it's all good
This how we do it in the country
This how we live in the woods
That's how we roll down them dirt roads
In the country it's all good

We keep that country bangin'
We keep it bangin' hard (Bangin' hard)
Better hold on to your hat
Better hold on to your mason jar (Mason jar)
I'm just a southern boy, stuck in my southern ways (Southern ways)
And I buy that hundred proof, I keep it running through my veins (My veins)
Up and down them dirty roads I'm in them ditches every day (Every day)
Fill my cup with southern pride and it won't never fade away (Fade away)

This how we do it in the country
This how we live in the woods
That's how we roll down them dirt roads
In the country it's all good
This how we do it in the country
This how we live in the woods
That's how we roll down them dirt roads
In the country it's all good
You might also like
Friends and fam, BBQ and beer cans
Big bonfire and we sittin' on in
While the kids run around barefoot havin' fun
Knockin' down cans with their bb guns
And the grownups gettin' drunk, just a good old time
Chuggin down beers and some good ole shine
Never name a pig that your 'bout to eat
And my trailers on the dirt not no city street
And I'm creepin' like I'm Eric Church
Four wheeler through the trails on some muddy dirt
Wake up and we do it again
This is how we do it in the country, my friend

This how we do it in the country
This how we live in the woods
That's how we roll down them dirt roads
In the country it's all good
This how we do it in the country
This how we live in the woods
That's how we roll down them dirt roads
In the country it's all good

We walk that walk, we talk that talk
We country as the day is long
Only time you country is when rap about it in your songs
Stackin' wood, catchin' hogs
In the middle of the swamp runnin' dogs (Runnin' dogs)
We giggin' frogs wearin' camouflage
And shinnin' deer at the chicken farms
Oh hell yeah I'm the one
The redneck that you love to hate (Love to hate)
They call me big fish and y'all just some spinner bait (Spinner bait)
This how we do it in the country
This how we live in the woods
That's how we roll down them dirt roads
In the country it's all good
This how we do it in the country
This how we live in the woods
That's how we roll down them dirt roads
