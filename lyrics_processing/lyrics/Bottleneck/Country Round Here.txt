Yeah, y'all know we keep it country, that's right

You know we work hard and then we play harder
Down in the south with them dirt road riders
Passing that jar, sippin' that clear
You know, we keep it country 'round here
All jacked up and redneck proud
Flyin' our flag, either free to get loud
Don't get bowed up, we got no fear
You know, we keep it country 'round here

Yeah, big old trucks jacked up to the sky
Country boys 'round here don't lie
Pretty much do anything we want
I grew up with nothin' but now I'm stuntin'
Out on these backroads fishtailin'
Slingin' up rocks 'fore the neighbors yellin'
Callin' me a no good crazy hellion
I did a lot of shit but I ain't no felon
I tried to stay underneath the radar
Sippin' moonshine from the mason jars
But these days it's kinda hard to be a redneck superstar
Still you can find me in the woods
Livin' good up in my hood
We keep it country 'round here just like we should man

I keep it country, yes sir, I got my country ways
I'm just a redneck by birth, and from the dirt I'm raised
Home of that orange blaze, down where them roads are clay
I keep my rebel flag in the air, and let him blow for days (haha)
We keep it redneck proud, we just some country folks
Yeah I know where the good liquor's at, but I keep it on the low
We throwin' bows where the sticky grows and pine tree rows
We keep it country 'round here, yeah ya hear me though

You know we work hard and then we play harder
Down in the south with them dirt road riders
Passing that jar, sippin' that clear
You know, we keep it country 'round here
All jacked up and redneck proud
Flyin' our flag, either free to get loud
Don't get bowed up, we got no fear
You know, we keep it country 'round here

We come jacked up and redneck proud around here parts
