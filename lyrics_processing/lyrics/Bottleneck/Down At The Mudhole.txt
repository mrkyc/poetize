Yes sir

Gettin' stuck down at the mudhole (At the mudhole)
Kickin' back and drink a few (Drink a few)
Gettin' stuck down at the mudhole (at the mudhole)
Jack 'em up is what we do (What we do)

Sweet home dirty road, big truck muddy hole
Redneck from the woods, dirty what you need to know
Deep in a mud rut, high like some moon dust
Raised in the bottom where everybody tip they cup
Yeah we some country boys, Bottleneck makin' noise
Keep it lifted up, big trucks on them 44's
Let the tailgate down, you can let your legs swing and
Giddy up country girl, momma shake your derriere
Raised in the woods, you know that we home grown
Bottleneck and Skynyrd 'bout to bring this thing home
On point like a frog, gettin' dirty like a hog pen
Truckin' like a big rig, and struts like a game hen

Gettin' stuck down at the mudhole (At the mudhole)
Kickin' back and drink a few (Drink a few)

You might also like
Raised up on little honkey tonk and some hip-hop
But when I'm muddin' I love to hear the beat drop
Here we go gettin' rowdy at the mud pit
Do it dirty it's time to let the tires hit
Dirty south, good times, let's yell yee-haw
But watch out make room for the big dogs
Keep 'em jacked up, ridin' in the sky
We got 'em blocked in, hey that's how we ride
That's how we do it y'all, we keep the cooler filled
That's how we do it in the mud baby down here
You know we do it right, we 'bout it all night
We gettin' stuck in the mud yeah that's right

Haha

D. Thrash from the Jawga Boyz gettin' stuck in the mud
Hot summer day in my jacked up truck
All four wheels spinnin' you can see my grinnin'
With a truck bed full of some redneck women
We some good ol' boys raised up in the sticks
Drink my first beer at the age of six
I keep my truck wet, Bud Light on deck
And I can't think of anything I regret
Down here there's no rules, just a bunch of fools
Nothin' I can't fix with a bunch of tools
So throw the hog on, man it's time to eat
Bottleneck tell them folks where we be, haha
