Yeah
Y'all ready to do that country walk baby?
Yessir

I shake them badonkadonks
I move them Honky Tonks
A little bit of back wood music
It make ya get up and country walk
I shake them badonkadonks
I move them Honky Tonks
A little bit of back wood music
It make ya get up and country walk

A little bit of music that make you wanna tip your cup
Drive your truck way in the woods yeah, and get it stuck
We keep them speakers bangin'
We keep them tweeters singin'
Down at the old Honky Tonk we keep them donkeys shakin'
Make that beer and liquor spill
Welcome to my Natty-ville
Country walkin', donkey talkin' party at them hay fields
Get barefooted y'all let's party 'til the dawn
Get a hundred redneck chicks with one Donkey Kong

Lookin' for Badonkadonk it's your boy Danny Duke
Droppin' that Honky Tonk
Look like Ed Hardy, drink like fish
Don't give a God dirty boy who he is
Sure got a 6 boy sling 'em up high
Straight from the south boy, country-fied
Dirty dirt road boy, it's muddy pop holes
Buck shot shells boy fishing poles
Hole in the wall 'cause they love our shows
Known to get buck anywhere we go
Mackie on the drums, Bobby in the back
Busta rippin' chords this country rap
Moonshine sipper, fresh water fisher
Down a whole pitcher boy, take a picture
Throw the keg but the party don't stop
Get your tail on up and do the country walk
I shake them badonkadonks
I move them Honky Tonks
A little bit of back wood music
It make ya get up and country walk
I shake them badonkadonks
I move them Honky Tonks
A little bit of back wood music
It make ya get up and country walk
Yes Sir
I shake them badonkadonks
I move them Honky Tonks
A little bit of back wood music
It make ya get up and country walk
I shake them badonkadonks
I move them Honky Tonks
A little bit of back wood music
