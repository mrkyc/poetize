Redneck on get your redneck on
Scream yeehaw and get your redneck on
Get your redneck on get your redneck on
Scream yeehaw and get your redneck on

Song, song, new song of the south
Get your redneck on is what I'm talkin' 'bout
Got my welding hat and my steel toes kickin'
Grandma's house for some fried up chicken
Dinner's all gone now I'm on the phone
Headin' to the sandpit to get my redneck on
Hit the woods stacked up, my gun racked up
Ride a country road where a car never backed up
Breaker breaker 1-9 you're loud and clear
Where I come from huntin' season lasts all year
I ride through the pits with some backstrap flying
January buck you know I ain't lying
Got a crooked game warden in my right hip pocket
Do what I wanna do man you can't knock it
Double wide crew keep it real in the sun
Got my redneck on so watch your mouth

Redneck on get your redneck on
Scream yeehaw and get your redneck on
Get your redneck on get your redneck on
Scream yeehaw and get your redneck on

I gotta spit got a big chew up in my lip
I'm 'bout to slip started early on my chicken tin
Got Hank Jr. bangin' out the radio
We on them 450s headin' to the water hole
Later on party at the mud bog
But first I gotta get home so I can feed dogs
I'm a redneck I ain't even lying man
I got a brand new single wide on piece of land
Run a back-ho, man, with my eyes shut
And my best hog dog got a beer gut
I'm from the dirty dirty I like to say it proud
You know we play "Sweet Home Alabama" loud
I got a 2-wheel drive truck with a big lift
And a big pair of balls on my truck hitch
Two big wings in my Levi jeans
Get your redneck on boy you know what I mean

Redneck on get your redneck on
Scream yeehaw and get your redneck on
Get your redneck on get your redneck on
Scream yeehaw and get your redneck on

I Got my redneck on, my camo on
Got my dogs loaded up and now its time to get on
Got my CB fixed, Got my hubs locked tight
Bout to hit the backroads and watch a bulldog fight
The yeehaw crew, the boys come through
Now what you gonna do when they come for you
Got my 30-30 sighted, sittin' in my lap
I got my redneck on with this country rap
Copenhagen can in my hand no plan
Woods at night for some big buck slant
Truck a few nanny goats and dress 'em up quick
Put 'em in the cooler and take 'em straight to the fire pit
Yeehaw I'm tellin' all y'all all weekend long this is how we ball
Many talk trash but they'll never try us
'Cause we mix Snoop with Billy Ray Cyrus
Redneck on get your redneck on
Scream yeehaw and get your redneck on
Get your redneck on get your redneck on
