Y'all gotta move on, baby
This for my dirt road soldiers
Where y'all at?
I know you on them dirt roads
That's right
That's right
Yes Sir!

Ridin' down a dirt road, sliddin' through the mud
"Simple Man" on the radio, spittin' in my cup
Got a pull off the Jack, spinnin' up them ruts
I'm a dirt road soldier I got in it my blood (Yes sir)
I'm the last of a dying breed, I'm country to the bone
I was raised in them pine trees, that's where I call home
I come from a dirt road I got it on my own (Aw yeah)
I'm a dirt road soldier, it's time to move on

Well it's time to move on, split the real from the fake
I got what it takes turnt dreams into fate
Few racks in the bank yeah, I got 'em on my own
And I'm the big buck got a head full of bones
Hit the dirt road hell I'm redneck ridin'
Cross on the rearview, cooler right beside me
Talk like a big ole pup stuck in them briars
All a man needs is a good set of tires (Hah!)
A good set of pipes to get your life in the grip
Keep it in the ruts, don't go in the ditch
Even when you itch keep your faith and move on
And stay in the dirt even though the road is long
I'm a dirt road soldier, a hick hop general
The road so hard the stress can make you miserable (Amen)
Yeah I'm still the same, there ain't nothin' changed
And yeah I'm still here still scratchin' at the game

I got it in my blood, been a rebel since birth
And Ima stay this way until the day I leave the Earth
The pine trees raised me, camouflage baby
Yeah you damn right that the southern way made me
Redneck crazy, I'm dirt road clean
Granny told me boy that I saw her at the dream
Beer cans in my truck bed, yeah they gettin' stacked up
Known to get rowdy, never scared to put 'em up (I ain't scared)
Dirt road baller, truck sit taller
Bonafide redneck on dirty ass boggers
I'm a turkey caller, sliddin' through the mud
Got an old grey beard, gettin' real country love
I'm the last of a dying breed, dirt road born and raised
Tighter than a knot down there in them river swain
Well I spit southern flame, sippin' on one-hundred grain
Gotta have some pull in your heart just like a tractor chain (Come on!)
