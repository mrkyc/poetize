Let's take a ride back

When I'm singin' to these old Hank songs I'm feelin' this buzz again
I'm lookin' in the rear view thinkin' 'bout life and where I've been
When I'm singin' to these old Hank songs I'm feelin' this buzz again
I'm lookin' in the rear view thinkin' 'bout life and where I've been

Thinkin' 'bout my days, just starin' through a window
Wouldn't change one thing, no complaints tenfold
Whiskey dreams and drinkin on, just bein' slow
Got me throwin' up all my country heros
Hank, Merle, No Show, Waylon, and Cash
Sometimes I just I think I'd like to stay in the past, ayy
Lookin' back they'll probably just laugh
Pass that bottle yeah, you on the right track
All this gonna take is a little less late nights
And a few more visits to the gravesites
Great minds think alike, just try to live life
Have a little fun but try not to stay high
Keep livin' it up and give it everything you got
At the end of your days if you're hot, you're hot
'Cause man made money, money never made the man
Faith, family, and friends, I gave it all that I can

Take a sip of the Turkey burn me a quirly of grass
Mister Cash 'bout to help me out on chasin' the past
Let's remember the 90's I try not to remind me
Got me reminiscin', better get your mind and rewind it
Now bendin' on the diamond, mama right there in the breeches
Not too bad of a pitcher, I could get you with a sinker
It was Greg Maddox and Glavine,  Avery and Smokes
A lot of memories of missin' but I'm humbled the most
All you gotta do now is click on the mouse
If I do forget a day it's saved there on the cloud
Only problem with that is that I hate a computer
So either way if I'ma do it need some beer and a cooler
I ain't thinkin' 'bout the future, need a way back buzz
I want the good times called before they're lost in the dust
So I keep on drinkin' so I never forget where I been, yeah

When I'm singin' to these old Hank songs I'm feelin' this buzz again
I'm lookin' in the rear view thinkin' 'bout life and where I've been
When I'm singin' to these old Hank songs I'm feelin' this buzz again
I'm lookin' in the rear view thinkin' 'bout life and where I've been (Yes sir)
Reminiscin', take it back with the Lac boys (Yeah)
Been in the game we some true southern cowboys (That's right)
Hold it down, take a look in the mirror
I take another drink of Jack, Hank's message is clearer (Yep)
We gotta ride for the cause, a country boy can survive
Can't let the south down we gotta keep her alive
Lookin' back where I been, all I see is the struggle
We kickin' up mud now, I left my paths in the puddle (Yes Sir)
Thinkin' back on the years (Damn), shed so many tears
I finally got where I'm goin', I thank God that I'm here
I've got a mission in life, singin' for southern pride (Woo)
I'm just a redneck son bitch 'til the day that I die
Got few more "woos", raise my jar for a toast
I'm deep down in this bottle, I think I see Hank's ghost
I sing along with my buzz, I think of back where I been
I think about where I'm goin' it's all good in the end (That's right)

When I'm singin' to these old Hank songs I'm feelin' this buzz again
I'm lookin' in the rear view thinkin' 'bout life and where I've been
When I'm singin' to these old Hank songs I'm feelin' this buzz again
