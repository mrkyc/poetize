44's, muddy hole, rebel flags, work that pole
Nice backstrap, keep it jumpin', slang that thing, keep it muddy
Dirty dirty, tractor ruttin', country folk gon' show y'all somethin'
Out in the sticks, you know we get loose and we keep a little deer blood on our boots
Big tires spinnin', music twangin', jacked up buggies, speaker's bangin'
Southern pride, yeah we love it, never hide and run from nothin'
All damn day cold beer in my cup and I keep on swiggin' on that jug
Country lovin', drunken chicken, big old truck and keep it kickin'
Keep on sippin', look at them dimes, cricket  done lost their minds
Gettin' crunk at the old mud hole, we ride 'em high and droppin' 'em low
Redneck bucket, country vibin', if you want some come and try me
Gettin' loose and throwin' that mud, yeah I think you know what's up

Down at the mud hole, everything is off the chain
Sippin' on that apple pie, you better watch out it might get you mayne
Gettin' right and gettin' loose with a good beer buzz and a hundred proof
Hands wrapped 'round that Mason jar, I ride like a mud hole superstar
Gettin' rowdy, jack it louder, mud hole queens all 'bout it 'bout it
Yeah, we go hard 'til the sun comes up and we keep a little drink up in our cups
Shake your right just go crazy, we can build it, you can break it
Scrub your ass on that dirt, make it hurt, my 4-low work
Us country folks we ride it rough, we bust the nuts off tractor hubs
Girls in the mud let 'em soak, then hit 'em hard like a blackjack oak
Get a rope, I need a tow, hold up girl, get off the choke
This is the life let's go muddin', get real dirty and learn you somethin'

Yee-haw talk that talk, push that gas and make it walk
Redneck Nation, hick vacation, come to the sticks and get real wasted
Country girls they shakin' it good, they cornfed and from the woods
Throw some mud, let it ride, them mud grips spinnin', let it fly
Bonfire burnin', big wheels turnin', super cracker, yeah I earned it
Throw a little mud, get 'er done, shake that thing, three-quarter ton
Watch it run, it's got some bounce, and country folks 'gon' turn it out
Yeah we waller, hoot, and holler, damn them trucks can't get no taller
Chains gonna jerk, watch it work, lose your mind in that dirt
Sip that shine, sip it slow, hold your beer, don't let it go
Can you feel it in your veins, mud holes is off the chain
Country folk, ridin' high, gettin' loose and gettin' right
