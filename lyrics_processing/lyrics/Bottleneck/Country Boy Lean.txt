Yeah you know how it is out here these boys livin' that country boy lean. With them trucks leaned back with those dog boxes in 'em baby. You know what I'm talkin' about

I got my country boy lean (Yeah)
My country boy lean (Yeah)
I'm so damn dirty in my country boy lean (Yeah)
In my John Deere green with my redneck team (Yeah)
My 44s scream makin' rutts in the beams (Yeah)

A muddy old huntin' truck with dogs in the back
I'm from the booger bottom got "Rowdy" on my tag
Got a rebel flag sticker on my rusty old tailgate
Cooler filled with Bud Light, less feeling taste's great
Couple bags of corn right on my toolbox
I gotta put in some work at my food plot
Later on got a party at the huntin' club
But right now I'm checkin' out a buck rug
County boy swag rollin' on a dirt road
I stay true just like a gun scope
Corn whiskey home-brew we let it ferment
The country boy lean yeah I got the permit
Man I ride like a bush-hog
Horny like a horn frog
Yeah I chase deer just like a hound dog
Catch me ridin' high deep in a mud hole
My truck bed wore out with some rusty holes

Still bakin' mud pies John Deere ride by's
Find me at the chicken pen while haters do fly by's
Sweet smell of Georgia pine moved up from nick and dime
Yeah you know a southern boy, uh 'bout to get mine
Slick like a river cat you don't want none of that
44 muddy water whip it up bring it back
High like a hog leg scale with a fish smell
Got 36 inches comin' Peter cotton tail
Got an old killer blue nose in my truck box
Got to keep the good shit safe 'til we make a drop
Down in the sticks we live by the G-code
Keep your big mouth shut then no body know
Bottleneck comin' through leanin' on a country beat
Boy you're too damn soft to even be an enemy
Country like a poppy seed, tag it like a bag of feed
Somebody tell your kin folk I'm the A-team

Country boys raisin' hell out in the country mud
We livin' life big like some tractor rutts
Big trucks, four wheelers ridin' tough
Dirty face got a beer and big snuff
My hat jack back jeans and my ridin' boots
And in my heart a redneck a hundred proof
Country folk we poured from a good mold
My country lean cat walkin' down a dirt road
Hit the gas we love to watch the mud sling
If you ain't heard this here's a hit thing
Yes sir certified southern tip
We from the dirty like a dip in a farmer's lip
Tailgates buggies with them stripper poles
Cowgirls moonshine in a muddy hole
See me in the cut tires keep spinnin'
A country boy lean with the mud still drippin'
