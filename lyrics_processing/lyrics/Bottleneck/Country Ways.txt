Some country ways

Where I live
Where I was raised
Where I'm from country ways
Where I live
Where I was raised
Where I'm from country ways

Yeah, a small country town, three stop lights
A little bit of pride on them Friday nights (Aw yeah)
Hell yeah let's party down at the new house
Or just take it to town and we can ride around
A little bit of beer sippin' hangin' in them parking lots
A couple fights but folks never called the cops
Just country ways every day we country made (Country made)
And yeah we pray hey that's how we was raised
Damn right I'm proud of where I'm from and where I live
I work hard, I write songs to feed the kids
Do what it takes to keep 'em warm and keep 'em safe
Some southern comfort for us yeah that where it stays
From the booger bottom out to the old Georgia line
Underneath the southern skies and them Florida pines
We raised here, this our home, this our town
Country ways yeah that's how it goes down

Remember where you got your first kiss and a black eye
Playing hide-and-seek in the woods yeah that's right
First pinch of snuff first little swig
Catching them red belly brim down at the trucker's ditch
Everybody know everybody down here
And yeah we know when you ain't from around here
Yes sir you know we look out for our own
And we pray when God calls somebody home
Country ways shine on me with your country grace
I give my thanks for every damn country day
That's how it is that's where we live the country life
I'm drinkin' cups but hell I try to live it right
And all I need the breathe in me and the southern breeze
My country ways, my rebel soul to stay at ease (Yes sir)
I love it here it's who am a part of me
I'm southern bred and yeah I won't ever leave
