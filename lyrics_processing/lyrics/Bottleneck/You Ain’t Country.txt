Got it in my closet like you posers fakin' every day
I'm out here shootin' deer, I'm out here drinkin' beer
You out here with them virgin boots your daddy bought, you lookin' queer
Poppin' hogs, flippin' frogs, runnin' dogs and gettin' lost up in the woods where you don't belong
Don't even think about it boy we gon' get you son bitch

Boy you ain't country (Pow, pow, pow), you're damn right I'm talkin' to you

You ain't country (Country), you don't live out in the pines
You ain't country (Country), 'cause out here we do it right
You ain't country (Country)
