Yeah
We gonna kill it Bottleneck
Redneck Nation, bitch
Woo
Upchurch (Upchurch)
Bottleneck (Bottleneck)
We 'bout to get it
Oh yeah

Redneckified, dirty boy I'm certified
Slingin' mud, bottled up, we ride on tractor tires
We in the mud and yeah we kick it southern style
A country boy, yeah, the dirty kind

Muddy water in my veins
All of my jeans got deer blood stains
All of my trucks got rust on the frame
With a big light bar and some dents in the paint
Gun in the glass, tinted my windows
I am the truth bitch I am no pretender
And all of my Dixie chicks sweeter than Splenda
Gon' be a rockstar, what's my agenda
I'm tougher than most and I don't even try
'Cause I'm catchin' good traction like I'm four-wheel drive
I'm gone like Earnhardt I leave 'em behind
And I flip 'em a bird from way up in the sky
Country as cornbread and big red tomatoes
I stare through my phone in some sick Aviators
Country rap prince I'm the Intimidator
And fuck all my haters with two middle fingers bitch

Dirty boy with a dirty kind
Raised in the bottom straight from the vine
If you come down here runnin' that trap
You're ass outta gas, fuck with a gaffe
Whatcha gonna do? Where you gon' run?
We some dirty motherfuckers we used to the mud
You played with wrong knife, that's right
I'ma hit like bird fight, get sliced
Rebel flag raised get your honky up
Ever look close at a Dixie cup
All white inside, certified
Spittin' on you motherfuckers redneck style
Got it in my blood, dirt in my heart
What do I even mean when I fart
Yes sir I'm rednecknecktified
I'm a filthy ass cracker 'til the day I die
