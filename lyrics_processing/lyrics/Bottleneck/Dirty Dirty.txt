Dirty folk broke and the pipe is on lean
Squeeze a quarter so tight boy, he can prolly scream
Got him dancin' with the devil like a rebel with the pedal to the metal
Barkin' at a hottie I ain't talkin' Molly
Got a twelve pack crushin' cans
Sippin' on some shine man drunker than a skunk
Ass swingin' off a rope jumpin' in the creek
Swimmin' in the lake, dirty feet
Where the water deep, thirty feet
Wrestlin' the gators, smokin' on a tater
Grannie pickin' maters out the garden
Try me like some  barkin'
We can crank it up and get it startin'
I'm a backwoods certified baller with a pedigree
A Pitbull a  Rotweiler ain't the hog waller
In the mud bog gettin' somethin' stuck (Somethin' stuck)
Muddy in the rut, and we muddied up truck (Muddied up truck)
Dirty girl by my side ain't scared to get dirty
Let's ride

Got a little shine and I'm workin' on a buzz
Yeah, out here you know we do it right
Yeah, we do it good and we do it all night
Hat pulled low, dip in the lip (Yep)
35 inch mud grips on the whip
That's southern fire and big old tires
Turned way up and get buck wild
That's how we get dirty way in the woods
Rebel flag way up there on the hood
We play with it son we ride them buggies
And every-damn-body's gettin' muddy
Oh yeah, off the chain

Truck's sit high like eagle nuts
So come on down and get you some
