We feelin' good on them Bud Light nights
Just kick 'em back and let's have a good time (Yeah)

Pop a top, let's kick it back
A little Kid Rock and some Johnny Cash (Okay)
Hit the clay road and we ready to play
And them Bud Light nights start everyday, hey
Back in the cut with my cup and my drank
And my tires in the mud and we doing okay
We do it all day that's how we get down
I'm feelin' that buzz you know we gon' clown
Hit a mud hole 'til the morning light
And a cooler full of beer got you feelin' right (Feelin' right)
Sling a little mud and chillin' with my folk
It's a redneck party down at the mud hole (Yessir)
A couple old friends made a couple new friends
Yeah we all here by the fire drinkin' beer
Pop another top, get 'em up high
Everybody buzzin' on them bud light nights (That's right)

Hey, beer thirty, I started with a six-pack
Now I'm on about twenty can't turn back (Turn back)
I'm doing work gettin' turnt feelin' cloudy
Everybody sippin' on bud gettin' rowdy (We get rowdy)
Howdy, let the good times roll
Hand around a beer 'til we hear the rooster crow
Let's go hard, funnel 'til we fall
And the Bud Light got me sippin' like a Large Mouth
Straight tore up ready for a selfie
Lord there ain't no help, nothin' can help me
