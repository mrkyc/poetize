Down there on the Georgia line
That Florida line where they ride real high
Them boys with the drip in the lip and they dump the box on a power line
44s make 'em roar with mud on the door when they chasin' boars
Gotta break a stick ran the pit, catch dogs we love that Ford
We just some country folk, we out here and we gettin' shitty
And in the woods is where I be if you got business with me
Dirty road super star, game to the bone is what we are
Get 'er done yeah bitch-sum, got a case of beer and a mason jar
Mud bogs and pine trees, yeah, my truck don't get stuck
This cracker right here is straight from the woods
If you want you some come get some
We can battle in the mud or throw 'em up
It don't make a shit to me, 90-1-4 playin' wide Ka de ville on 33s
Catwalk my 4-wheeler up and down that Florida dirt
Watch out now, don't get hurt 'cause I'm runnin' dogs and I'm chasin' birds
You ain't heard Bottleneck I am from the woods son

Next time you think of a country boy big son think of me
You know we hard on 'em
My truck I'm hard on 'em
You know I'm country one-hundred I put my heart on it
We hunt damn near anything: Deer in the fall, birds in the spring
Better quite talkin' that shit we might hunt you too mayne
Yes sir we gonna let 'em loose on ya
Hah! we gon dump the pops on ya
Big tires and the country lean
Whippin' tear it up in the trees
I'm just a country boy but you don't wanna fuck with me
You know how we do it in the woods
I make this shit look good
I'm out here in the sticks I'm a country boy, that's understood
Sideways bottle of liquor, I like shine, beer, and shots
I'm creepin' through the thicket late at night on my 30-ought
I got them high beams lookin' for them big bucks
I'm from the woods Buck
