Alright, y'all got me, I'm a redneck haha

I like catfishin' and Beech-Nut spittin'
I like cow tippin' and bullfrog giggin'
I like mud boggin' and apple pie swiggin'
You're right, alright, I might be a redneck
Honky tonkin' and redneck women
I like bush hookin' and old buck skinnin'
I like slow sippin', just listenin' to the crickets
At night, alright, I might be a redneck

I like livin' that simple life out in the woods (Yeah)
Drinkin' a cold beer up under a truck hood (Haha)
Turnin' wrenches and tryin' to get the motor right (Y'all know)
So we can hit the mud (Yeah), and watch it take flight (Ha)
Sittin' on the back porch with my shotgun (Uh-huh)
And if I see a buck (Yeah), I'm gonna pop one (Haha)
Because I got one, maybe four or five
Hangin' up on the wall, that's how we all survive (That's right)
Yeah, I don't need much (Nah) to keep me happy here (Nah)
I keep the freezer packed (Hah) and crack a cold beer (Yeah)
And I got no fear up under these pine trees (Nope)
Yeah, I'm a redneck, no need to remind me

Rebel flag so damn high, can I get a "hell yeah"?
I'm southern rockin', lockin' me in and poppin' tops and
Hick-hoppin' and, yeah, I keep the country knockin'
Lockjaw I hold it down like a bulldog
I eat 'em up with southern drawl, I'm a bullfrog

I drink 'shine, might get into a big bar brawl
