Sometimes you just gotta ride on
Not worry about nothin'
Yes sir

Can't you hear them pine trees talkin'?
Don't you miss a little mud bogging?
Can't you hear them dirt roads callin'?
Tellin' you to come right on
Can't you hear them pine trees talkin'?
Don't you miss a little mud boggin'?
Can't you hear them dirt roads callin'?
Tellin' you to come right on

Missin' me a dirt road
And a beer between my knees
Starin' at my rear-view
Rollin' through the pine trees
Deer tracks, in the dirt
Good lookin' game trails
Heaven gonna feel like this when we get there
Big ol' pine trees talking to me in the breeze
Man I hope they don't cut 'em down in the spring
Ride on, I guess that's the way it goes
They try to hold down anything that's gonna blow
I took my dreams and now I pay the bills with it
I took some criticism but I can deal with it
I just cruise real slow down a dirt road
Take another sip and put it in the console
Little ol' mud hole coming up on the left
You know I gotta ride through 'til there's nothing left
I'm just a country boy, them dirt roads are calling me
Just keep it in the ruts, yeah, you can follow me

You ever dropped a tailgate and drug your feet in the sand?
Draw the line, had to fight and become a man
Ride on, and slow up before the curve
Don't let the ways of the ride throw you in dirt
Don't let the ditch get ya, navigate the potholes
And when the road splits, know the one to follow
Sometimes we all need a pick-me-up
Ride tough on a dirt road in ya truck
Camouflage koozie is here to keep my beer cold
And I tell my kids the same thing granny told
Creepin' through the mud while I'm headed to my deer stand
My mind on some red-bellies and some some deer hams
Stay strong like the line of a bush hook
Keep the faith and ya nose in the good book
Feel the breeze, be free through the pine trees
Country boy for life and that's all I'll ever be
Can't you hear them pine trees talkin'?
Don't you miss a little mud bogging?
Can't you hear them dirt roads callin'?
Tellin' you to come right on
Can't you hear them pine trees talkin'?
