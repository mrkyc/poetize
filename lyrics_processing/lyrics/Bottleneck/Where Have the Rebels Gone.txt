A hundred years in the makin' has changed over the generations
This thing that they call country ain't country anymore
The way I see if you ask me I think things oughta go back
To when we had Waylon, Jennings, and Jones and a whole lot of Johnny Cash, yeah
There's a whole lot I don't agree with like why they banned my flag
They talk about privilege and we're too good but in the same breath we're just white trash (White trash)
And I don't agree with that Hollywood scene I think they're doin' it wrong
And all it boils down to I gotta ask Lord where have the rebels gone

I'm kinda outlaw, kinda John Wayne like Brantley said is country wide
And like Haggard said God bless my mama 'cause Lord knows that she tried
And I don't expect for you to agree or see what I see eye to eye
But you're damn well gonna respect my country pride, yeah

Little bit of country pride for you, oh yeah
Country pride, rebelized and bonafide (Yes sir)
We never run we wear it proud and never hide (That's right)
No reason to talk trash and blow smoke (Nope)
Our word is true yes sir we country folk
Uh, I'm still wondering where my privilege at
I think it's time for us outlaws to take it back (Yeah)
Stand up get respect when you say somethin'
And if you don't they damn sure can get somethin'

You best damn well respect my country pride
