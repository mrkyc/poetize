Yeah buddy
I got a shotgun riffle and a four wheel drive
An old cage dog sittin' by my side (By my side)
Forty-four inches sittin' way up high
And I'm 'bout to pop a top on a cold Bud Light
I got a shotgun riffle and a four wheel drive
An old cage dog sittin' by my side (By my side)
Forty-four inches sittin' way up high
And I'm 'bout to pop a top on a cold Bud Light

My truck's so high you might catch a nose bleed
My old cage dog sittin' at my feet
My grandaddy's mossberg on my lap
Hangin' low in the woods like a guitar strap
Bottleneck and Brahma Bull just some low rent livin'
Bud Light sippin' and some Copenhagen dippin'
Redneck country boys from the booger bottom
All them bone heads on the wall yeah, we shot 'em
On the Florida Georgia line, and we ain't talkin' bout a cruise
Boots or barefoot, we don't wear no shoes
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Sittin' 'roud a camp fire playin' old Hank too
We've been known to raise hell and make a little bit of noise
When we want to crank it up we jam them Double Wide Boyz
Y'all remember, yeah we go way back
The Super Cracker and the Bull yeah that's a fact

Me and Brahma Bull go shake them gun racks
Let's go 'head and pop a top and kick it way back
Old cage dog, rockin' the beer gut
And an old pair nuts swingin' on my truck
Them forty-four inches the treads about gone
And like a creek buck the thing still runs strong (Yessir)
Old Double Wide sticker still stuck on the glass
And some beechnut wintergreen stains on the dash
And my daddies old riffle shoots long and true
And my twelve gage pump still lettin' 'em loose
At the hog wild mud bog stuck in the mud
And every damn buggy was showing us up
We got them big old tires we was high like an oak limb
And yeah we got some big old nuts we run this hog pin
Bottleneck and the creek yeah we go way back
No big hats here and that's a fact
