And be a simple man

I'm a simple kinda of man on a country back road
With shot guns and fishin' poles
I'm a simple kinda of man I'm running the land
It made me who I am
I'm simple kinda of man on a country back road
With shot guns and fishin' poles
I'm a simple kinda of man I'm running the land
It made me who I am

I grew up poor and country down a dirty road
My southern soul 'bout to bring this mother country home
I'm from the land and the home where country be
We got them sweet sticky leaves and them magic beans
You ever looked to the stars on a southern night
You ever looked real close at a bull dog fight
You ever been toe to toe with a thug
Back in the woods knee deep truck full of mud
We go stuntin' down at the gator hole
Drop a hook in they ass then we watch them roll
We drink shine straight from a moonshine drip
Have you ever lost your soul to this country shit
Got drunk decked out in camouflage
We ain't huntin' we lookin' for some plants to crop
Get some drank and the one eyed dog
Let's raise a little hell at that old mud bog

You ever shot a bucket 300 in the dark
Get greasy then shutdown the bar
You ever rode on the roof of a Cadillac
At 95 with them police chasin' fast
That's why they want me but I'm above the law
I'm from the country yeah that's how I ball
And if you want it draw a line in the dirt
Or throw 'em up or walk away with your feelin's hurt
I'm country born homegrown with the country pride
And I reckon Ima stay that way until I die
You can find me still runnin' them country roads
I'm feelin' Dixie down here that's the way it goes
Get rowdy lit up raisin' hell
We yeehaw and sometimes rebel yell
At the river in the moonlight stackin' cans
We drunk as hell it's the life of a simple man
I'm a simple kinda of man on a country back road
With shot guns and fishin' poles
I'm a simple kinda of man I'm running the land
It made me who I am
I'm simple kinda of man on a country back road
With shot guns and fishin' poles
I'm a simple kinda of man I'm running the land
