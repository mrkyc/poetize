Just take me home, where I belong
I've been gone too long, I wanna sing my song
Just take me home, time keeps on rollin' baby
Walkin' down an old dirt road just singin' my song
Just take me home

Take me to a happy time, country livin' Friday night
A real country boy spittin' flame, that's southern fire
Somewhere in the moonshine I'm sippin' I lost myself
Now I stand alone and I'm drinkin' from an empty well
Deer tracks in the dirt all across my drive way
How'd I get drunk away far from my special place
God, won't you bring me home I know you won't steer me wrong
I'm gonna let my past (Yeah) marinate in this song
The open road pushin' me close to the river's edge
I'm just a country boy: what you see is what you get
Nothin' up my sleeve but a true, hey,  southern way
Strong like a rock been known to handle anything
I done seen so much pain but I can never change
I'm just a rebel boy backwoods born and raised
Bet it on my life everything's real in this song
So I'm gon' stay strong and hey

Just take me home, where I belong
I've been gone too long, I wanna sing my song
Just take me home, time keeps on rollin' baby
Walkin' down an old dirt road just singin' my song
Just take me home

Hick life in my soul, small town slow your roll
You ever looked into the sky from a dog's water bowl
Wash it out, clean your pen, think about all your sin
Where ya at, who you with, family, and where you been
Who you keepin' close and who really got your back
Givin' tough love to my kids like a briar patch
Dented up and bruised like a '95 Evinrude
Ride like champ steel toed like a Brahma Bull
Barefoot, cut off jeans, swimmin' in the fishin' creek
I can't explain what home really means to me
Clothes lines, pine trees, backroads, four-ways
Walkin' in the woods, I'm ridin' on them tailgates
Sun shinnin' through the leaves, sittin' in my deer stand
Jumpin' out a Jon boat, toes in the river sand
You damn right this my song, southern rap standin' strong
Straight from my roots but now it's time to

Take me home, where I belong
I've been gone too long, I wanna sing my song
Just take me home, time keeps on rollin' baby
Walkin' down an old dirt road just singin' my song
Just take me home, where I belong
I've been gone too long, I wanna sing my song
Just take me home, time keeps on rollin' baby
