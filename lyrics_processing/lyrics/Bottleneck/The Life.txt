Well this redneck life is for me
And my favorite color is real tree
I like to drink a few beers and shoot a few deers at night
I been known to leave my shit in the yard
And have talks with my best bull dog
I like to jump in the truck and go get stuck in the mud
I love a good chicken fight
And a Honky Tonk on Saturday night
Or just a red cup chillin' sippin' on that home made wine
I live down an old dirt road
It ain't much but I call it my home
I'm just a backwood chillin' livin that redneck life

Well my redneck ways the life of a country man
I am what I am and I can't see a better plan
Out in the woods we let the day roll by
Out in the woods we live that redneck life
Ridin' on them big wheels shinnin' hay fields
Down at the pond came fishin' for blue gills
Take 'em to the skinnin' rack
Love to hear the water run
Down at the barn dippin' in a corn drum
Pull up my boots one at a time
The redneck nation, a redneck life
Something 'bout a breeze blowin' through the pine trees
And hangin' you a deer stand deep in the creek
Man you gotta love that: deer tracks
Waitin' on a big buck with a big rack
The redneck life, the one for me
And the redneck life is where I wanna be
