We just some homegrown country folk straight from the backwoods
Dirty dirty southern drawl yeah we make this look good

We party with a southern drawl, we scream yeehaw
Up and down them backroads we ride 'em like a seesaw
Find us in a mud ditch, chains on my truck hitch
Sippin' on a cold beer I'm hooked like a mud fish
Ride like a 35 stayin' on that country grind
Bottleneck is hot like a backstrap southern fried
Find us where the gettin's good down in the deepest woods
We do this thing homegrown like those country folks should

We can run a trot line and we can skin an big buck
Party 'til the daylight, Redneck Nation join the ride
Hicks from the sticks do it dirty old southern style
Way out in the huntin' club hell yeah the music's up
Have a little fun big truck in a mud rut
Country to the bone 44's got 'em spinnin' chrome
We exist some country folk 'bout to bring this thing home

Hotter than a lighter nothin' tougher than a tractor chain
Get 'er done that's what we do, we'll shoot you just like an old .22
We hunt and fish ridin' high, we take big swigs of the apple pie
Tailgate down and the music up, home-brew in my dixie cup
Old dirt road is all we know, country folks now here we go
