'Bout ready to wing it
I'm ready son, let's do it

Well it starts out on a Friday night
A cooler full of beer and a gal in the shot
Me and my boys just tryna get out and ride again
After a long hard week of grindin' that clock
Make you wanna grab your girl and pop you a top
Jump in the old truck, cash the check then we at it again, yeah

Just wingin' it
We're just wingin' it tonight

And grab all your friends and kick it on back
Slingin' up the mud and singin' and laughin'
We bout our a beer who's going on a run again
We ain't got no plans but feelin' pretty good
I got a sweet little thing straight from them woods
The bonfire's ablazin' ain't no tellin' where the night'll end

I'm just wingin' it
We just wingin' it tonight

Yessir
We just wingin' it and kicking 'em back
The beer's ice cold and everything's on track
To hell with the plans, let's start us a fire
Tonight might end with little dirt road ride
Feelin' pretty good with redneck friends
And then we started takin' them fire ball swigs
Damn it's gonna be one hell of a night
And you can't call it good 'til we see us a fight
Let the party keep going, let's get turnt up
Take it easy on the shine, don't get burnt up
Well that all right 'cause we got plenty of beer
Well this is how we do, we just wingin' it here

Haha we just wingin' baby
You know how we do Bottleneck
Yeah
Tyler you about ready
Yeah boy

If you ever down here in my part of town
Where the dirt roads are rockin' and the crickets are loud
A'toastin' red cups and we singin' that Simple Man, yeah
Well we done got right, can't remember the song
Got all my drunk buddies just singin' along
It's a pretty good night and I'm guessin' this is where it ends
Just wingin' it
