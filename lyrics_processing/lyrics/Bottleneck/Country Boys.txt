Yeah
Aye Bottleneck
What up dog
We bout to get drunk tonight boy
Well lets get it then son
Let's go and turn it out one time

We ride them dirty roads (Dirty roads)
We rock that camouflage
We drive them big trucks
Country boys is what we are (Come on)
We from the east and west
We from the north and south (North and south)
We from the woods
Yeah, country boys can turn it out (Come one)

True in my drawl and some southern swag
Mud on my tires and a rebel flag
Got 'em locked up tight, never know which hole I'ma hit tonight
You ever seen a country boy ride so clean
I'm dirty but you know what I mean
I reckon I'm a boss from the woods, big buck
This cracker look good
I'm a country boy and I'm country raised
Stay in the sticks, drink shine for days
Any kind of huntin' I do it all
Got a country pimp with a southern drawl
Keep it real high on them big ol' wheels
Country boy is in my grill (Hey)
Got a red cup up in my hand
Its a country thing you understand

I'm just a redneck
Roll to the liquor store to cash my check
Prey the oysters, burlap sack
Beer on ice with a dog in the back
Got an ATM in the back of the shed
It's called a Mason jar you touch it and you're dead
Bury my shine in the back of the yard
Hide my stash in an old junk car
Possum huntin', coon dog runnin'
City folk let me show you something
Speakers in the grill, you can hear me thumpin'
Swamp buggy you can see me comin'
Stop the truck and shine the light
Got a boonie  in my sight
One shot, all right, load em up and we'll ride all night

A lot of country folk talk with a twang, might walk with a limp
'Bout to get ripped way back in the sticks
If you ain't all in then get your ass out
We drink til the sun comes up in the south
Like hardcore Hank, Merle, Waylon, and Willie
Got old cash money workin' on the millie
Might get someone comin' through with the shine
I'll ake two or three swigs losin' my mind (Yeah)
Look at all these dimes in the mud
Ridin' through slow in the black and red Bronco
Bottleneck bumpin', gettin' into something
Take a few swigs, right on the money
We keep it country, laid back low
An Evinrude strapped to my old John boat
Little small town life and there ain't no doubt
Just some good old boys finna turn it out
We ride them dirty roads (Dirty roads)
We rock that camouflage
We drive them big trucks
Country boys is what we are (Come on)
We from the east and west
