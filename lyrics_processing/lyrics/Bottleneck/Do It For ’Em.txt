Let me get on this thing Bottleneck
I told you man, I got you brother, come on
Well lets do it for 'em son

I do it for the rednecks in the mud
I do it for the rednecks ready to roam
I do it for the rednecks it's one love
I do it for 'em, yeah, I do it for 'em
I do it for the rednecks in the mud
I do it for the rednecks ready to roam
I do it for the rednecks it's one love
I do it for 'em, yeah, I do it for 'em
I do it for the rednecks in the mud
I do it for the rednecks ready to roam
I do it for the rednecks it's one love
I do it for 'em, yeah, I do it for 'em

Jawga Boyz and Bottleneck comin' from the dirty south
Makin' music for out people ever since we came out
Do it for the country folks, do it for the rednecks
Do it for the trailer parks, we all livin' check to check
Back when I was comin' up, all the yuppie rich punks
Laughin' at the way I talk, always tryna make fun
Callin' me a redneck, thinkin' they was dissin' me
Now they see me poppin' and they reachin' out listenin'
I ain't tryna hear it 'cause I know what they was all about
Smilin' in my face, when they walk away they talk about
Me, and my family and how we just some honky's (honky's)
Fakin' they my friends but they real as Willy Wonky
So I had to represent and give y'all some music
Something for the soul, so y'all can use it
When you take all you can take from the city (haha)
Hop up in the truck, I'ma take you back with me
'Cause

Yes sir, I'm a gritty boy, always got my swag up
Rep the Redneck Nation, go ahead get them flags up
The white trash president, from the mud I'm heaven sent
I do it for the red on my neck it's what I represent
Call me white lightning, don't talk about what ain't the truth
Y'all ain't even on my level here, y'all can hold my boots
Need someone to blame, put my name on that 4x4
Stand up for the change, this the realist shit I ever wrote (yes sir)
Yeah I'm a country boy, don't drag my faith through the mud
Take my rights, take our guns, but you can never make us run
I'm the blood of a rebel heart, run deep down the dirt road
Deep inside this Carhartt, shoot for cracker, 10-4
Yeah them crackers never scared, rebel flags up in the air
Jump to the left you know I got a hundred rednecks everywhere
Bonafide hillbillies way up in the hill really
Bottleneck and Jawga Boyz redneck to the bone with it
I do it for the rednecks in the mud
I do it for the rednecks ready to roam
I do it for the rednecks it's one love
I do it for 'em, yeah, I do it for 'em
I do it for the rednecks in the mud
I do it for the rednecks ready to roam
I do it for the rednecks it's one love
