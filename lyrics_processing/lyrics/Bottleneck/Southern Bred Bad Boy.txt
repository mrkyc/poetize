Y'all get them dixie cups up and get rednecktified baby
We from the dirty south
We southern bred, baby

I am a southern bred bad boy raised by the grace of God
(We keep it dirty dirty, we keep it homegrown)
I am a southern bred bad boy straight from the sticks, yeehaw
(Yeehaw)

Spray like like buck shots
Stain like some moonshine
We watch the still drip in the moonlight
I think the moon's right, we 'bout to get tight
We 'bout to throw it up, we 'bout to start a fight
Make them haters slit their wrist when they wanna listen in
I'm country like some southern grits so put me on your wanted list
Stay on that southern shit
Mouth like a gator pit
This is Bottleneck Cuz crackers have you heard of him
Big buck T-shirt, got my best huntin' hat
I'm from the woods, what you know about that
J-jumpin' like som frog legs, belly like a beer can
You know I keep it country to the bone 'cause I'm southern bred
Grindin' like a spit stone, knife made with deer bone
Southern like a Skynyrd song 'cause I'm the only Honky Kong
Mud in between my toes down here that's how it goes
Deep in the woods drinkin' beer watchin' 'maters grow

My hat jacked back, dip in my front lip
Them big tires damn sure make the mud rip
These dirt roads are where these country folks live
You can find me in the creek where the bow bends
I'm from the woods, a true heavyweight
I'm like a bull heard about to bust a gate
This is my way of life, I keep it homegrown
They call me Super Cracker, the redneck Al Capone
I am the dirty south I am the Fat Man
But when I put in work its for my Southern land
Sharp like a bush hook hangin' in a tree limb
But when a cracker's camo-ed out you cannot see him
I'm like a navy seal, I am a muddy wheel
I'm tighter than a SpiderWire on a fishin' reel
Dirt roads, tall drinks, trucks in the low gear
Tearing up the mud while I'm sippin' on a cold beer
I am a southern bred bad boy raised by the grace of God
(We keep it dirty dirty, we keep it homegrown)
I am a southern bred bad boy straight from the sticks, yeehaw
(Yeehaw)

We keep it dirty dirty
