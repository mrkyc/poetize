You know we live it
Worried about what we ain't got
What you do if you had more night (One more night!)

If you had one more night
Make sure its a good one, uh huh
(Just one more night)
If you had one more night
Make sure its a good one, uh huh
(Just one more night)

Well Ima get Johnny Cash on them mother-truckers
And I'm talkin' Men in Black on them mother-truckers
Y'all ain't never seen an outlaw like me
'Cause Ima ride 'til I die, get the best of me
And Ima say a prayer with my drink in the air
With my head held high, it's too late to be scared
I'm gonna waller on out 'til the morning light
And then I'm gonna shine in the glory light (Yeah)
Ima be me and as long as I believe
Keep the faith in my heart, love my friends and family
What else really matters
There ain't nothin' else that matters
As long as I keep it real, hold it down and stay at it
Stay on my grind with both eyes on the prize
I shed a tear for you boy 'cause I had a good ride
Yeah it's my time, I had a good time ballin'
Now I hear my friends that left before callin'

If I had one more night with y'all (Yessir)
And if I  had one more night to ball
I ain't 'gon lie I'd probably spend it with my kids
Sit around thinkin' about stupid shit I did
But anyway there ain't no need to cry
'Cause Ima hold it down and go where the free birds fly
These old dirt roads made a rebel man
And you gotta live your life the best you can
Forgive your enemies, reminisce on memories
As you prepare to leave, leave a hell of a legacy
And ride it on out you better cowboy up
And if you livin' fast you better tighten 'em up
I'm just a redneck son on the streets of gold
And we don't never know what the future holds
You gotta be your own man, gotta live your life
What would you do with it, just one more night
If you had one more night
Make sure its a good one, uh huh
(Just one more night)
If you had one more night
Make sure its a good one, uh huh
(Just one more night)

That's right (That's right)
Yes sir (Yes sir)
You gotta live your life (Your life)
Yes sir (Yes sir)
That's right (That's right)
You gotta live your life
