You were lookin' too girl you know it
Can't help but notice you
Don't like the way your night is goin'
Stirrin' your drink, takin' a sip, glued to his hip
He ain't payin' no attention baby
He's doin' his thing, watchin' his team, winnin' the game
With no idea of what he's losin' baby
So I was thinkin' maybe
If you wanna take a ride in a Silverado
Down a dusty road where the wild things grow
We can park when the sun starts to fall
And if you wanna real man that knows how to hold ya
Then there's a side of me that I'd like to show you
Girl if that sounds good to you at all
Then you know who to call
Underneath the drink in front of you
I put my number on a paper napkin
I tipped the waitress a 10 or two
To play it off like nothin' happened
It's your move, it's up to you
Whatever you wanna do lets' do it baby
'Cause he wouldn't know if he was alone
Why don't we go do somethin' a little crazy

Then you know who to call
Then you now who to call
If you wanna kick back underneath the stars
Feel what it's like to feel a spark
Steal a heart that wasn't mine at all
Then you know who to call
You know who to call
If you wanna real man that knows how to hold you
Then there's a side of me that I'd love to show you
Girl if that sounds good to you at all

You might just see what its like to be
Treated like a lady
And you know who to call
