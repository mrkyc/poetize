Isn't it funny how people in this world count you out? Hey, hey, hey
But it's okay 'cause I don't let it get me down in no way, no way

Skip to my lu, dip do, dip da da, dip do, dip do, dip da da
I'm gonna make it through today and tomorrow
Dip do, dip da da, dip do, dip do, dip da da
I'm gonna make it through today and tomorrow

If the sun stops shining today
I have a feeling that everything will be okay
I heard you made a bet on the L to lose
Slide off, easy, I don't bruise
L-I-S-A L-I-S-A has got something to say

Skip to my lu, dip do, dip da da, dip do, dip do, dip da da
I'm gonna make it through today and tomorrow
Dip do, dip da da, dip do, dip do, dip da da
I'm gonna make it through today and tomorrow

Doot doot doot doot doot do do
