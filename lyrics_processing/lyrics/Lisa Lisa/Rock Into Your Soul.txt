Rock it, rock it, yeah
Shake it, shake it, c'mon, yeah
Rock it, rock it
Shake it, shake it, ah

You're getting tired of everybody that you know
And everyday somebody else is hangin' on
Just turn off the phone
Time to get your shit together
There's funky music on the radio, uh
So kick off your shoes and blast it through the wall
Screw the neighbors callin'
Gotta let that rhythm get'cha

Let the music rock into your soul
It's about the funk tonight
Feel the music, feel the music
Music's gonna get you through it all (All)
Let the music rock into your soul
(Rock it, rock it)

Once you let the rhythm take control
It doesn't matter if it's blues or rock n' roll
If it's new or if it's old
It's just gonna make it better
You ain't got a reason not to let your body go
It's only you and your own four walls
Listen to it callin', the beat is gettin' hotter
You might also like
Let the music rock into your soul
It's about the funk tonight
Feel the music, feel the music
Music's gonna get you through it all (All)
Let the music rock into your soul

Take off your clothes (Take off your clothes)
Dance around the room
You're all alone
Ain't nobody watchin' you (Ain't nobody)
Put on a show, only your mirror knows (Only your mirror knows)
Just work it out
Feel the music


Feel the music
Let the music rock into your soul
It's about the funk tonight
Feel the music, feel the music
Music's gonna get you through it all (All)
Let the music rock into your soul (All)
Let the music rock into your soul
It's about the funk tonight
Feel the music, feel the music
Music's gonna get you through it all (All)
Let the music rock into your soul
Yeah, let the rhythm take control
Yeah, c'mon, yeah
Ah, yeah, let the rhythm take control
