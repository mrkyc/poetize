Seems just like I fell into your ocean
It's so very cool and so very blue
Quicker than waves, almost as smooth as lotion
Just what am I supposed to do?
Over and over, I've made mistakes
Now that I'm older, I know the stakes
Higher than ever, a risk I take for only you

When I fell in love
I never thought I'd fall this hard
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd go this far
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you

You are my sweet symbol of elation
All I need is a flash of your sweet smile
Don't need no more of the infatuations
That scene is really not your style
Looking back now, a few regrets
Many happy days, but with you I'd let
You take me further that I've been before for only you
You might also like
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd fall this hard
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd go this far
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd fall this hard
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd go this far
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you

When I fell in love
I never thought I'd go this far
I love you

Finally, an answer to my questions
Oh and how I want it to be
Now that we've got a positive relation
It's as plain as anyone can see
Over and over, I've made mistakes
Now that I'm older, I know the stakes
Higher than ever, a risk I take for only you
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd fall this hard
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd go this far
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd fall this hard
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you
When I fell in love
I never thought I'd go this far
When I fell in love
I fell in love with you

Ooh-hoo, when I fell in love
Ooh-hoo, fell in love with you
Ooh-hoo, when I fell in love
Ooh-hoo, fell in love with you
Ooh-hoo, when I fell in love
Ooh-hoo, fell in love with you
Ooh-hoo, when I fell in love
