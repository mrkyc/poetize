I don't know about you
As for me, I'm through
Through with always standing still
'Cause now, now I'm on the move
And I can finally see
The path was right in front of me

It was hard, I broke down (Ha-ah)
I was kicked to the ground (Ha-ah)
I gave up, I gave out (Ha-ah)
I was lost, but I found (Ha-ah)
I was strong didn't need (Ha-ah)
Anyone else, but me (Ha-ah)
In my heart always knew (Ha-ah)
That in time, I'd let my spirit carry me

Booyah, booyah
Now I'm ready, I'm open so
Booyah, booyah
Let it go, let it blow over
Booyah, booyah
If it don't work just throw it away
Booyah, booyah
Because life is too short to play
You might also like
I guess I had to learn
The tables always turn
You just gotta roll with it
I press on, it's just another day
Whatever comes my way
I know I can handle it

In the blink of an eye (Ha-ah)
Dreams can melt in the sky (Ha-ah)
And the love that you give (Ha-ah)
Is the life that you live (Ha-ah)
But I won't change a thing (Ha-ah)
'Cause I'm still gonna dream (Ha-ah)
You can come for the ride (Ha-ah)
But if not look out my train is coming through (Ha-ah)

Booyah, booyah
Now I'm ready, I'm open so
Booyah, booyah
Let it go, let it blow over
Booyah, booyah
If it don't work just throw it away
Booyah, booyah
Because life is too short to play
Look out now, I'm on the move
Jump on my train if you want to
Just let your spirit carry you
'Cause you can dream if you want to
Life is too short so don't play
If it don't work throw it all away
Press on, it's just another day

Booyah, booyah
Now I'm ready, I'm open so
Booyah, booyah
Let it go, let it blow over
Booyah, booyah
If it don't work just throw it away
Booyah, booyah
Because life is too short to play
Booyah, booyah
Now I'm ready, I'm open so
Booyah, booyah
Let it go, let it blow over
Booyah, booyah
If it don't work just throw it away
Booyah, booyah
