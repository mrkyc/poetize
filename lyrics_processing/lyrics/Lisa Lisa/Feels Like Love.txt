Baby, baby

Some kind of change is goin' down
'Cause I feel so lonely when you're not around
I keep on thinkin' (Keep on thinkin'), 'bout yo smile
And the way you truly make me happy all the time

My heart is fallin' for you (Fallin')
I can't explain how I adore you
Got me hopin' got me thinking
That we're gonna be makin' plans (Yeah)
I just wanna be around you, baby
I can't wait

I can't wait until I'm back in your arms (Oh, no)
'Cause I miss you every minute you're gone
Time is endless when you stay away too long
(When you stay too long)
I can't wait because you feel like love

When I see your face everything feels all right (Feels all right)
But when you're gone it's like I'm just wasting time
Say the word (The word), and I'll be yours (Be yours)
Because I know exactly what I want and you're the one
You might also like
Your heart is calling for me (It's calling)
It's sayin I'm not really (Could be love)
Got me hopin', got me wishin'
That you gonna stay in my life (In my life)
And I know you wanna tell me, baby

I can't wait until I'm back in your arms (Back in your arms)
'Cause I miss you every minute your gone (Every minute your gone)
Time is endless when you stay away too long (Stay away too long)
I can't wait because you feel like love

Baby it's you, I want by my side (My side)
Because nobody's ever made me feel
The way that I feel around you
You're one of a kind one love for all time (Time, time, time, time)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, I can't wait

I can't wait until I'm back in your arms (Back in your arms)
'Cause I miss you every minute you're gone (I miss you every minute you're gone)
Time is endless when you stay away too long (Baby, it's you)
I can't wait because you feel like love (You feel like love)
I can't wait until I'm back in your arms
'Cause I miss you every minute you're gone (Feel like love)
Times is endless when you stay away too long
I can't wait because you feel like love (Feel like love)
(You feel like love, you feel like love)
