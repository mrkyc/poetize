My heart was filled with love and devotion
I gave it all to you
And in return you gave me nothin'?
It's always been 'bout you
Now it's done
Finally won my freedom from the pain I was in
I'm takin' back my life and my pride
I've got nothin' to give 'cause you took everything

I've had enough now
(Don't say a word, don't make a sound)
(Don't you even look at me)
I'm fed up now
(Just call your boy, you can call your girl)
Don't care just let me be
You turned me inside out
(I believed in us, now it's just disgust is all I got for you)
I've had enough now (Enoughs enough and it's)
It's so over (Enoughs enough)

I don't know why I stayed and waited
I fell for you no doubt
I tried and tried to be so patient
But this is my final bow
Shame on you, how could you deceive me?
I was so good to you
Don't tell me that it's all gonna change
'Cause I won't back down, there's no turning around

I've had enough now
(Don't say a word, don't make a sound)
(Don't you even look at me)
I'm fed up now
(Just call your boy, you can call your girl)
Don't care just let me be
You turned me inside out
(I believed in us, now it's just disgust is all I got for you)
I've had enough now (Enoughs enough and it's)
It's so over (Enoughs enough)

I blame myself for not demanding more
I let it go too far
Maybe you'll find somebody else
Who'll put up and shut up, but I know for sure

I've had enough now
(Don't say a word, don't make a sound)
(Don't you even look at me)
I'm fed up now
(Just call your boy, you can call your girl)
Don't care just let me be
You turned me inside out
(I believed in us, now it's just disgust is all I got for you)
I've had enough now (Enoughs enough and it's)
It's so over (Enoughs enough)
I've had enough now

I'm fed up now
