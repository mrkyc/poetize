It's kinda hard when you're tryin' to stay (With the best love)
That your body's ever known (It started off good)
But the love hasn't grown and stickin' around isn't workin'
Your hearts' sayin' walk away ('Cause everything's changed)
Right before your eyes (And everything's strange)
Between you and I
Because we were lovers before we were friends

Right now I think we need a time out
Baby, all we do is fight now
And baby, that ain't my style

So I gotta move on (Gots'ta move on)
'Cause the love is done (I wanna trade it in)
And get a better one ('Cause now it don't fit me)
For either one of us (So I need to get a refund)
Can I get a refund?
(I gots'ta move on) 'Cause the love is done
(I wanna trade it in) And get a better one
('Cause now it don't fit) For either one of us
(So I need to get a refund) Can I get a refund?

Like shoes that are just too small
You try to break 'em in anyway
You try to wear 'em and forget the pain
But you can't ignore that it's hurtin'
And it's just like me and you
We bit off more than we could chew
Make the same mistakes most people do
We need to pack it up and return it in

There's nothing else we can do
(But say goodbye and walk away)
I made the wrong choice in you
(So I'ma pack it up pack it up)
Boy, nothing's changed, what's the use
In stayin' unhappy
I gotta leave, (Want to) you're not the one
Here's my receipt to get a refund
(I wanna trade it in)
