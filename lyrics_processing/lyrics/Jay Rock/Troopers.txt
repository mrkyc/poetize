Cardo got wings

It's work on the phone
Tell my mama that I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers
I said it's work on the phone
Somebody tell my mama I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers

If that's your real nigga, he gon' slide for you
If that's your real nigga, he gon' die for you
You ain't gotta question when it's brackin'
Just point me in the direction when it's action
Day ones in the sandbox, from breakin' through them padlocks
To burners in the stashbox, your whole hood mascots
My whole hood mad Watts, that's gang, gang, gang
We politic, on missions, don't hang, hang, hang
We got bad bitches too, huh, and they blast bitches too, huh
And they shoot the fair one too, huh, we can take it there too, huh
Niggas win some and lose some, just went half on a new drum
Summertime is overdue huh, double back when the news come

Back door, back door, East Side, we go back door
What you wanna act for? You get what you ask for
Ballin' in the game now, East Side, we go back door
(East Side, East Side, East Side, East Side, East Side)
Nothing is the same now, motherfuck the task force
Came up and I went back, changed up, never did that
If it's taped off, yeah I did that, blew a half a mil', yeah, I did that
On the blade, girl, is you with that? Ten toes on the pavement
Sell your soul in the Days Inn, shacked up like a caveman
Troopers on deck, secure the bag, we plant the flags
So what we on next? What we on next?
Rock bottom from the NG's, handguns on the ten speed
RIP to my dead homies, loyalty is all we need, yeah
It's work on the phone
