Count the days when we can be together once again
I'm far away, but you are in my head
You are all I think about
You have all my time
You and I should be together
But I will be denied simple life
So we say goodbye
So long, I'll see you again
Close your eyes and go to sleep
And dream about the day we'll be together again
Sacrifice so we can be free without a struggle
Looking back again, there's fortune in the wind
Some will say that I'm insane but I do it all for you
Contemplate this game, a simple life for fame
You are all I dream about
You are on my mind
You and I should be together
But I will be denied simple life
So we say goodbye
So long, I'll see you again
Close your eyes and go to sleep
And dream about the day we'll be together again
Sacrifice so we can be free
From all the struggles that are coming our way
Close your eyes and go to sleep
And dream about the day we'll be together again
Sacrifice so we can be free without a struggle
You might also likeJust want you to know
That I'm empty inside and I miss you like crazy
How long will you go?
Oh I don't really know, but I'll try to get home
So please come back home
The struggle is holding me back
Close your eyes and go to sleep
And dream about the day we'll be together again
Sacrifice so we can be free
From all the struggles that are coming our way
Close your eyes and go to sleep
And dream about the day we'll be together again
Sacrifice so we can be free without a struggle
