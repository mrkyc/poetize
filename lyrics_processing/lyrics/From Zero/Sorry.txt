Cuz you ain't laughin'
And I'm sleepin' on the couch again
And all this arguing was back and forth
And I wish you could just see things my way
Wouldn't it be nice
I'd be king for a day, but that'll never happen
I realize I put you to the floor, now you're out the door, and you don't want no more
It's just my jealousy, thats got to me
And I guess I know I'm wrong
Could you forgiven me, just talk to me
Cuz I'm begging you this time
I'm sorry that I said those things I said you were
But I guess I'm all stressed out
I'm sorry that I never let you finish what you need to say
Forgive me, we'll work it out
Well I know I can be a big pain in the ass sometimes
But sometimes I feel like telling you to stick it where the sun dont shine
And all that means is that we disagree, and its fine with me
And our little girl dont need to be seein' the shit we do
Regardless if who's right or who's wrong
It just ain't cool
But I'm just here to say I'm sorry
And to hope that you accept my apology
You might also likeIt's just my jealousy, thats got to me
And I guess I know I'm wrong
Could you forgiven me, just talk to me
Cuz I'm begging you this time
I'm sorry that I said those things I said you were
But I guess I'm all stressed out
I'm sorry that I never let you finish what you need to say
Forgive me, we'll work it out
And all this arguing was back and forth
I realize its always me creating it
And all this arguing was back and forth
I'm sorry that its come to this
I'm sorry that I said those things I said you were
But I guess I'm all stressed out
I'm sorry that I never let you finish what you need to say
Forgive me, we'll work it out
So dont let go
So dont let go, please
So dont let go
