Tried... or you get what we give
I feel like I'm stuck in between
Again, again, again and again
Loath, I've been subjected to what you've said
You're pissing harder than what you know is right
A joke where you stand, no thought overflow
Look down on the upside
Take, you've taken more than enough away
You say tomorrow is just another world
That'll choke in you throat, so you dope up the flow
And look down on the upside
Slave... you get what you bring
Tried... or you get what we give
I feel like I'm stuck in between
Again, again, again and again
Break, a broken spirit is what you gave
You hold the pieces of what you know are mine
Crawl back in your hole, and choke on the bone
Of what's left on the outside
Never again, never again, never again
You might also likeJust leave me what is mine
Throw you away
Test me over time
Just leave me what is mine
Throw you away
Test me over time
Too bad things aren't what they seem my friend
To be my friend
Too bad this is all I try
Too bad things aren't what they seem again, seem again
I've washed right out, of my dear old past
That was the filth on me
Loath, I've been subjected to what you've said
You're pissing harder than what you know is right
A joke where you stand, no thought overflow
Look down on the upside
Take, you've taken more than enough away
You say tomorrow is just another world
That'll choke in you throat, so you dope up the flow
And look down on the upside
Slave... you get what you bring
Tried... or you get what we give
I feel like I'm stuck in between
