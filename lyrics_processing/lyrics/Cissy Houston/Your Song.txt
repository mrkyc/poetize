It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

And if I was a sculptor, but then again, no no no
Or a woman who makes potions in a traveling show
Oh, I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

So (And you can tell everybody) tell everybody that this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words, mmm
(How wonderful life is) How wonderful life is
(While you're in the world) While you're in the world

You know I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, hmm, a few of these verses, well, they've got me quite cross
Oh, but the sun's been kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
You might also like
(So excuse me forgetting) Excuse me forgetting but
(But these things I do) But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
(Anyway, the thing is) Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
That yours are the sweetest eyes that I've ever seen

Oh, you (And you can tell everybody)
So go and tell everybody that this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
(How wonderful life is) How wonderful life is
(While you're in the world) While you are in the world

(I hope you don't mind) Oh no (I hope you don't mind)
Please don't mind that I put down in words
(How wonderful life is) How wonderful life is
(While you're in the world) While you are in the world
(I hope you don't mind) Whoo ya (I hope you don't mind)
Please don't mind that I put down in words
(How wonderful life is) How wonderful life is
