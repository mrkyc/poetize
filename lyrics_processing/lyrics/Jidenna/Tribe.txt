Who you with?
Who your crew, who your clique?
Who your fam, who your Set?
Who your gang, who you rep?
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all?

That my tribe
That my crew, that my clique
That my fam, that my set
That my gang, that my rep
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
That my tribe (Ayy, yeah)
That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
Feel like one of the crew, feel like one of the crew
Ain't got nothin' to do, ain't got nothin' to do
Feel like super glue, feel like one of the crew
And I'm runnin' with you, we got money to move

Put your pride in a trash bin
Too much ego in the captions
Don't get swept up, like a Tesla
You ain't really need the gassin'
Hate to see my niggas clashin'
Hate the plot, love the casting
Tryna catch a nigga lackin'
Bet the tribe will outlast him
Every nigga got a accent
And a funky way of dancin'
And we give the world our passion
And they still afraid of black skin
Niggas tryna split a fraction
It's mo' money for the trappin'
Stadiums full of vibranium in the land of the black skin
And it's time that we cash in
Fill the hunger like I'm fastin'
Less thinking and more action
I'm so motherfuckin' tapped in
Black star on the cap and
Babylonian assassin
Fake woke niggas nappin'
Tuck 'em in like a napkin

That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
That my tribe (Ayy, yeah)
That my tribe (Yeah)

"Travel wide, travel wide"
That should be my battle cry
That should be my alibi, now (Yeah)
Travel wide, travel wide
I and I, by and by, that my tribe (I and I, by and by)
They tryna conquer all the tribe
We laugh and multiply, divide
Let 'em try, let 'em try, let 'em try
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all
That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
That my tribe (Yeah, ayy)
