Beware Interlude
I feel it in the air
Do or die, nigga, do or dare
Caught a nigga in the trap, catch a nigga in a snare
Been there, been where most niggas wouldn't dare
Yeah, niggas wouldn't dare
Young nigga, beware
I see the light in you, my nigga, ah yeah, I see the glare
My nigga, beware
You a rocket, you a rocket
I can see it, you a motherfuckin' flare
Yeah, nigga, we rare

Young nigga, beware, yeah
Young nigga, beware
Young nigga, beware, yeah
Young nigga, beware

Tell 'em I see them, we bucking
Tell them I need 'em to rush it
Been on time and under budget
It ain't up for no discussion
Made you look me in the mirror
When I sent you la mujera
I met with Mr. Miyagi
Told me the higher we go
Nigga, beware

Young nigga, beware
