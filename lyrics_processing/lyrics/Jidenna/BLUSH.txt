Shit
I ain't even gon' hold you
You got me giddy with your pretty self

You got me drivin' from the Valley to the LBC
The homies sayin', "Damn, you spendin' gas on that?
Is the pussy made of juice? Is the ass so fat?" (Ooh-wee)
My nigga, please believe
Yeah, my love's tatted on my sleeve, my sleeve
The heart is just a muscle, gotta squeeze the squeeze
And if it breaks, you rebuild it, if it bleeds, it bleeds
(I) Make you yell to the sky
When I'm grabbin' around your hip with my head in your thighs
Called my dog in Khartoum, he said, "Bruh, that was soon"
She ain't even moved in yet, but you call it y'all room
I'm in love with your pearl, comin' up in this world
I mean, your boys would call you gay when you crush on a girl
That's the way we was raised, in a way, we was hazed
Keep it cool, pimpin' your feelings must stay in the shade
(I) It's what it is
When I love a woman, I ain't afraid to commit
Only when we fuckin' am I gon' call you my bitch
Though I really hate to admit I know I need ya
You might also like
(I) I came with my mask off
Your kiss won't disappear
Baby, it's crystal clear
(I) Niggas don't blush no more (Blush no more)
But they wanna fuck you raw
Baby, but for you, I'd cry
(I) Niggas don't blush no more (Don't blush no more)
But they wanna fuck you raw (Raw)
Baby, but for you, I'd cry
Cry, cry
Cry, cry
I'll take off my cool for you, babe
Cry and cry

Haha, you got me singin' off in a corner
I can't even talk to you on the phone in public no more
'Cause you make me talk, baby, talk
But the real thing is, um
It don't matter if I go into the other room or
Slide in your womb or
