You'd better clean up your mind
'Cause I can see no reasons why
You should be stepped in line
Don't you think it's time
To do it, do it, do it, do it better
You can do it better if you try
You can do it, do it, do it, do it better
Do it better if you try
Why don't you try, try
Why don't you try, try
Give it up a little
Try, try
Try, try
Everytime we walk
And everytime we talk
Everytime you make me feel so slow
Why don't you shake it up
Why don't you break it up
Why don't you shake it up
Why don't you give it up
You're a slowmotion girl
Slow motion
You're a slowmotion girl
You're in slowmotion
Girl, girl
You make me feel so slow
Girl, yeah

Take a look around
I don't believe the spy in the sky
Will save your life
Don't you think it's time
To do it, do it, do it, do it better
You can do it better if you try
You can do it, do it, do it, do it better
Do it better if you try
Why don't you try, try
Why don't you try, try
Give it up a little
Try, try
Come on let's...
Try, try
Everytime we walk
And everytime we talk
Everytime you make me feel so slow
Why don't you shake it up
Why don't you break it up
Why don't you shake it up
Why don't you give it up
Why don't you get yourself together
Why don't you get yourself together
Tell me why
Why don't you get yourself together
Tell me why
Why don't you get yourself together
You're a slowmotion girl
Slow motion
