Yeah yeah, that a the sound when the rhyme reach me
Inna me mind if the rhyme please me
Then me take time fi put it pon the right beat fi it
Diggy digging 'bout nine feet deep fi find it
And if him find it, him affi go provide it
Any beat me collide with, me pick a fight with
Tump up the kick, cut the snare with me knifey
Lyrics them hot like grabba a Standpipe
It nuh easy now, fi find lyrics like these yah now
Hol' a seat a mek we reason now
Cause me without the rhyme is like weed without the THC
Doctors without the PhD
Officers without the gun pon waist, so when me buss a rhyme
Me have it lock and me a cut it like Busta Rhyme
Me buss a line like me skip to the front of it
Do it for free cah me spit fi di fun of it
Yeah, so me a vocalise
Cause nuff a them a spit total lies over mics
And now with me them waa fi socialise
Because me music it nuh localise
Is no surprise
Seh
Me nuh have no hook pon dah chune yah
But when me done them ago hook pon dah tune yah
When me spit me next line
Every woman inna di dance ago ask what is number of me next line
It ago tek time fi me buss
Big, no mini bus
Yesterday you see me pon the mini bus
Crush linen stuff, no tight skinny stuff
Down to me wallabees
Gyal I hear yuh holla please
Cause all of these artist fake
Them nuh see seh this artist great
Weh them a orchestrate
Them tell me seh me Clarks is fake
And when them the the touch stage, bokkle cross them face
Them feel seh them a di toppa thing
And one year pass and mi figet seh them did drop a thing
Wannabes true them drop a Sting
Now them head hot, like a top a spin
True them drop a Sumfest them a confess
Them a di real thing
Sizzla Kalonji dem, a dem a di real thing
Buju, Capleton, yow a them a the real king
