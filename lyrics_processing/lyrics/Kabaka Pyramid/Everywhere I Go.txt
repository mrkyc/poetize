Well, everywhere where I-man look, I see, pollution...
Violence and crime, disease a spread
Ah, yeah
Pyramid
Yeah, na-na-now

Everywhere I go
I see pollution and disillusion, oh yeah
Where is the world I know
We falling like a domino
Huh!
Everywhere I go
I see pollution, what's the solution, oh yeah
Where is the world I know
I say, we reaping what we sow

I see innocent faces behind prison cages
Civilized slavery, immunized babies
Living live crazy, all these sugar cravings
Man-made diseases dem released inna the trade winds
Where is the world that I was raised in, things so quickly changing
Lost inna me timeline, no more books and pages
Religious wars raging, for these corporations
Bargaining and trading, hell fires razing, oh
You might also like
Everywhere I go (cha)
I see pollution and disillusion, oh yeah
Where is the world I know
We falling like a domino
Everywhere I go
I see pollution, what's the solution, oh yeah
Where is the world I know
I say, we reaping what we sow
Huh

Look at what is happening, natural hair flattening
GMO patenting, the people for the slaughter
Medicine developing, placed inna the guillotine
Tumour start swell off and you run go check the pastor
If we no do something now, then what will happen after
Human race running and the finish is disaster
And as I ask the, oracle about the future
She said, "You listen to the past", I tell her, say

Everywhere I go
I see pollution and disillusion, oh yeah (how true)
Where is the world I know
We falling like a domino (uh huh)
Everywhere I go
I see pollution, what's the solution, oh yeah (so so true)
Where is the world I know
I say, we reaping what we sow
Bang bang
From the place weh test your faith
Weh the only thing a rise, a double-murder-a-day-rate
Some people stay, some people leave
Mama pray while sister grieves
And nobody no assist the people
The system does trick the people, me see dem, no fi dem
Dem come yah with bad influence, gi' dem
Stop fight fi dem fight back
Nuff woman a cry and Bob wouldn't like that
I bite back, it used to carry a girl with round ass
Now it carry youths dem weh rounds blast
Don't tell, then I won't ask
About last week, one year past is me last weep
So ask people, pass evil
Pastor pass fast, nah response fi lost people
People lost and bodies never found again
And you a tell me say, the devil no deh 'round? No, man!

Everywhere I go (everywhere)
I see pollution and disillusion, oh yeah (you know)
Where is the world I know (oh where, oh where)
We falling like a domino
Everywhere I go (uh huh)
I see pollution, what's the solution, oh yeah
Where is the world I know
I say, we reaping what we sow
Huh

Everywhere I go
I see pollution and disillusion, oh yeah
Where is the world I know
We falling like a domino
Everywhere I go
I see pollution, what's the solution, oh yeah
Where is the world I know
