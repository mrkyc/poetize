Dem say the signs of the times are showing
Look at the way the youths dem growing
(Na, na now, now, now, Kabaka P., hey)
Accurately speaking again
Come mek we reason again, yeah
Kabaka Pyramid I'm talking to the youths dem (aye, aye)

Dem see the love and wah come drive in hate
Many youths cyaan even read a license plate
We send dem go a school
But dem bound to the brain's limitations of time and space
We nah teach dem fi meditate and find that place
That happy state jus' dilapidate
If the youths is a conception immaculate
Why so many youths get decapitate, hey

Di youths need fi know
Say knowledge a di key
To any possibility dat dem can achieve
Di youths need fi know
The ways to the truth
So many growing up fi be a slavery recruit
Di youths need fi know
About dem family
Dem ancestral lineage an what dat really means
The youth need fi know
The right seeds weh fi sow, yea, yea
Hear mi now again

So many youths a get stifle with rifle
No know nuttn bout life cycle
Dem confidence coulda taller than the Eiffel
But a just di bleaching cream dem a get eyeful, aye
Dem haffi think about survival
So the school never witness dem arrival, no
We neva teach dem say unity a strength
So a bare competition with dem rival

Still di youths need fi know
Say knowledge a di key
To any possibility dat dem can achieve
Di youths need fi know
The ways to the truth
So many growing up fi be a slavery recruit
The youths need fi know
About dem family
Dem ancestral lineage an what dat really means
The youth need fi know
The right seeds weh fi sow, yea, yea
Na na now
