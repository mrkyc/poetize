Dem seh dem ago run through it
Dead body drop a gong when dem don do it
Buss it dem a buss it, no confuse
A just bullet dem a bump you with
And conk you with
Politician dem no give a dyam
Fuss ting pon them Chris must listen 
Oh they coulda be so wrong
Now its hopeless the grotesque
It's just a part of the process
Like how the youths dem smoke cess
Just fi rise up high
Above the lies of the high socie'
Some a dem a get caught
And dem ain't no giving Christ a try
A try fi say that him die for I
While the ghetto youths a die for ploy
Upon the site
This unconstructive  and shot bridge
Mi country politician fi run this
But we better haffi beg the bossman fi conduct this (hahaha)

Blood a spill like H to O
When guns ring out the slums
Taking souls
The ugly road
None shall escape the cold
Everyone's gotta pay the toll now
And it's a mission when you living in this soldier town
Believe me
Politicians waan fi hold us down
Believe me
Create a Guinness' fi the vote amount
It grieve me
Cah dem left the youths dem floating round the scenery
Now dem fed up on the joke around fi squeeze it
It inna the ghetto where the hope no found so easy
Under the pressure cyaan  now he feels it
He's more stressed with a potent pound it heal me
No make dem use you like no pawn
You play dem game and you get caught
Inna dem maze and lose your path
And when you stray a who for fought
One day betta mus come
So we haffi mek a way
Shadow must run yeh
Politicians seh we betta buss gone
Fi go mek the blood run
Tell him get accustomed to it
One day betta mus come
So we haffi mek a way
Shadow must run yeh
Politicians seh we betta buss gone
Fi go mek the blood run
Tell him get accustomed to it

Kabaka
Forgive me if this verse offend you
Food for thought, we a serve the menu
Get a good start dem a work fi enyo
Lock of the dance and we a work the venue
Denyo,  a couple a youth fi a stock
Revolution time a truth we a talk
Mek we tek it to the ghetto where the Uzi a spark
Street psychology and dem a shoot inna class
Dem a shoot fi a Clarks again
And a break the law fi wear a suit like Gargamel
Now the woman dem a balanced well
Babyfather him gone soon as the belly start a swell
But the betta days soon be here
Cah mi watch mama bang her belly through the years
Fi mek sure seh the food fi the youths prepared
When the gideon start tell babylon to beware

One day betta mus come
So we haffi mek a way
Shadow must run yeh
Politicians seh we betta buss gone
Fi go mek the blood run
Tell him get accustomed to it
One day betta mus come
So we haffi mek a way
Shadow must run yeh
Politicians seh we betta buss gone
Fi go mek the blood run
Tell him get accustomed to it
