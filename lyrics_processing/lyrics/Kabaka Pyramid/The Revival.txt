This is a lesson from the valley of the kings
A page from the pyramid text me a go bring
Unity alone can stop the suffering
So beg you listen to the words weh me sing

Inna this ya movement
None a weh no rival

Much more than them tools and jewelry
Inna this ya movement
Just listen weh mi talk
A babylon a  inna the dark

Tell ya now, watch dem

Dem woulda do anything fi see we fight and cuss

And love and harmony that a weh I-man lust
So while some artist a stack up dem riches
Inna the community the yutes a build bridges
