Trodding the valleys and the path ways
See seh dem endorse hate
Fi mi life dem wah fi gamble like a horse race
Heart racing, when mi start lace up mi boot
Wid no fear

No scissor, no comb hair, no shear
No sleep at times, hungry belly till we weak at times
So mi people can have peace of mind
But this peace of mind is very relative
Dem wah fi tek a piece of mine and sell wi relatives
When we combined dem see how dread it is
Cutting off we enemies energies, yeah
