(Verse 1 : Kabaka Pyramid)
This a di energy the people dem been lacking
The reggae beat dis a nuh trapping
All who feel like dem a tapping
Really sleeping and dem napping
While mi flying roun di world
Think man a genie like Aladdin
And for water down the message just for streaming I'm not having
People inna foreign seh dem nah get nuh good music
So mi gwaan inna di booth and then record
Like man a cupid
Hit the target when mi shoot it
It nuh hard fi execute dis
Lyrics God mi done tell yuh fi watch mi prove it

Hear mi now
Three colours run the four corners of the earth
The five oceans, seven seas, seven wonders of the world
Jah buss the seven seals and sound the trumpet have you heard
Of 1892 the seventh month the 23rd
Unto us a son was given unto us a child was birthed
The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, Haile Sellassie I the First
Some a dem a wear the colours and dem nah do dem research
Now sing along just like we rehearsed
(Chorus: Damian Marley and Kabaka Pyramid)

Lock off Babylon dem heart beat
When the Rasta start speak
Nuff a dem a blaspheme

Until we walk in
With the Red Gold and Green
An every man turn inna king
Every woman turn queen
The Red a fi di shedding of the blood weh set we free
The Gold stand for justice and equality
The Green is for abundancy and fertility
And the Lion stand for sovereignty
