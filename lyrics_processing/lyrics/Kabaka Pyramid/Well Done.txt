Well you fi get a round of applause, fi all the work you doing
Decisions weh you mek weh lef di country inna ruins yow
Strictly personal gain yuh pursuing
So di tax rates higher dan di planes weh yuh flew in

Di hotels and the beaches, di Spanish dem go screechie

You done a wonderful job a tear down we country, demolition man
Well done, Well done, Mr. Politician Man
You done a such a great job selling out we country with you business plan

A wah kind a plan
Which is to keep poverty and unemployment on the rise
Corruption and not to mention the lies
Elections a wen the tension arise
So you buy we Kentucky not to mention the fries
Anything fi secure your votes
And then you rob the people fi secure your boat
Fi go a Goat island weh the Chinese own
The whole Jamaica is a Chinese loan
Me tell you

Well done, Well done, Mr. politician man
You've done a wonderful job a tear down we country demolition man
Well done, Well done, Miss politician lady

And you still nuh pay we
But still if inflation was a test you woulda get A+
So when me mek the US the exchange rate buck
For the dollar getting weaker
And the solar light bill it woulda cheaper
But a JPS you prefer keep yah
Ebenezer, so you Scrooge pon the ghetto people
Weh you starve and every year you buy a better vehicle
Di things you do a beat we bad
But still you manage fi keep your job
So me ah tell you

Well done, Well done
Mr politician man (Tek we money and you gone)
You've done a wonderful job and tear down we country, demolition man

Comeen like Humpty Dumpty now

Congratulate dem enuh

Yah man a nuff tings unno a gwaan wid enuh
But the youths dem see it still
So we give thanks
