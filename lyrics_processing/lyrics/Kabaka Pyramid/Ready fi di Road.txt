I hear the calling
Now mi giving them a warning
Seh mi ready fi the road from morning

Mi seh mi ready fi di road
Put mi pon the radio
Mi ready fi di road
Mi no come fi play here
So mi touch the stage show
And the fyah just a blaze
Seh dem never did know
I&I a run the place

Listen me now
Rebel music pon the riddim
I a chant it
When dem see me near the microphone them seh mi haunting
I a meditate by the rivers Jah jah planted
A seed inna me soul mi works mi must perform this
Consciousness it is the key
If you deh pon the mic it's your responsibility
To bring the truths and rights up
It's the youths dem got to feed
To reach to the heights of Rastafari livity
