We ready now I and I deh pon a mission
The younger generation have the vision
Pressure Busspipe and Kabaka Yuuuuhh (Accurate!)
To all my sons and daughters yuh

Mi go say
Make way
Rastaman bursting through your gateway
Trod a Mount Zion that's the safe way
Trodding through the narrow and the straight way (skibbilibeng)
So mi go say
Make way
Ghetto youth bursting through your gateway
Holy Mount Zion I a maintain
Trodding through the narrow and the straight way

Watch yah now, Pressure
That one yuh name
Make way 'cause a hurricane a pass
Me sorry for anything we come inna we path
Dem a go call we terrorist
When time we drop this like a bomb
The Kontraband
Off the pain upon 
Whenever I perform
See the youths dem form like Voltron
We no programmed
With dem slogan
Everyone strong like Hulk Hogan
Stronger than the Ganja round a Oakland
We stronger than the pyramids weh stand upon mi homeland
Jamaica where we born the situation kind of sticky
The youths dem a the future
But the leaders are over sixty
I try shall lead the way
And then impurity pon mystic
When the revolution start yeah
That one now going down in history

Ay
This natty dread a move on
The fyah yah no look warm
Let me take some time fi clarify all this confusion
There is too much pollution
Inside them institution
Rastafari is our alternative solution
Some things you cannot run from
Like energy consumption
Non-renewable energy inna every area of production
The climate in dysfunction
Vulcanic eruption
Earthquakes and tsunamis cause catastrophic destruction
The people inna crisis
Blaming it on ISIS
Terrorist dem funded by the same ones weh a fight it
The Russians and the Chinese
The States that are not united
World War Three and everybody is invited
So hey
Make way
Rastaman bursting through your gateway
Trod a Mount Zion that's the safe way
Trodding through the narrow and the straight way
So mi go say
Make way (skibbilibeng)
Ghetto youth bursting through your gateway
Holy Mount Zion I a maintain
Trodding through the narrow and the straight way

This is a warning to
The one dem a go dem a distribute
One dem a running the institute
Tired fi see dem a diss the youth
And a move like say dem invincible
I and I study the principal of life
Weh manifest in triple
Nuff a dem eyes dem in cripple
Capital dem third ventricle
See dema come in dem tentacles
Dem seeking after life
Like dem no know the youths them sensible and a pree the afterlife
That is only just a phase in the circle of return
In the fever of destruction
I am the fire that will burn
Watch the food and what you eat
The schools and what you teach
Know the universal laws are never the rules of what they preach
Watch your own and watch your speech
The company you keep
Be aware of the pollution that dem dumpin' inna the street
Low the dumplin' and the wheat
Just reach towards the greens
The youths not hungry for no meat
We no dumb we no retreat
This is no something for the tweet
The fyah I release
A make
Babylon just drop it a we feet
Pressure say
It a go say
Make way
Rastaman bursting through your gateway
Trod a Mount Zion that's the safe way
Trodding through the narrow and the straight way (skibbilibeng)
So mi go say
Make way
Ghetto youth bursting through your gateway
Holy Mount Zion I a maintain
Trodding through the narrow and the straight way

Dem Rastafari youths dem taking over
Man ah trod it like a soldier
