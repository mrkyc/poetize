When we speak of love
It's not just something you have for one person
Love is impartial, it's immaterial
It can't be divided, you know?
Kabaka Pyramid again..
Telling them again now
Whoo, whoo, whoo, yeah, yeah
So weh me talking
World wide love, take note

I'm singing of a world wide love
From the seeds in the ground to the skies up above
This is a world wide love
Not just my family and friends, all me enemies me send
This ya world wide love
You coulda rich, you coulda poor
Still me give you more
Of this world wide love
Do away with the hate and grudge

We are one human race
Many different colours, many hues and shades
Some hair picky, some smooth and straight
But the same blood a flow in our tubes and veins
Tell me if you ever saw love a separate
Living as one that our ultimate fate
I no see why them ah try dominate
Love, it a the source where the I life create
No matter what's the time or place
You might also like
In this world wide love
From the seeds in the ground to the skies up above
This is a world wide love
Not just my family and friends, all me enemies me send
This ya world wide love
You coulda rich, you coulda poor
Still me give you more
Of this world wide love
Let's do away with the hate and grudge

You love, you no partial
Love for the soldier, the police and the corporal
This next generation of youths a not normal
Love and I-nity what how you live it to royal
Love inna soul and your soul is immortal
Don't get me wrong, me love my blackness
But spiritually there is only one exactness
What is immaterial can never be separated and that's a fact

Yes, me say we need world wide love
From the seeds in the ground to the skies up above
This is a world wide love
Not just my family and friends, all me enemies me send
This ya world wide love
You coulda rich, you coulda poor
Still me give you more
Of this world wide love
Let's do away with the hate and grudge
Love ah the power of attraction
Bind us together like the web the spider sat 'pon
It different from affection
It different from infatuation, any verb or any action
Many lurking, many factions
Many religions try fi tell you what is love and them no got none
I beg you look inna heart
Be careful what you put in inna thought, be smart

And sing for the world wide love
From the seeds in the ground to the skies up above
This is a world wide love
For all my family and friends, all me enemies me send
This ya world wide love
You coulda rich, you coulda poor
Still me give you more
Of this world wide love
Nah, nah, nah, hey, hey

World wide love, that is what I'm giving
World wide love, naah do no killing
World wide love never pay no shilling
No, no, no, hey, hey
World wide love, take it ah China
Hmm, dung ah to Australia
North and South America
Then a Europe share, but to Africa we spreading

This ya world wide love
From the seeds in the ground to the skies up above
This is a world wide love
You coulda rich, you coulda poor
Still me give you more
Of this world wide love
Not just my family and friends, me enemies me send
This here world wide love
Nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey

Ooh yeah, world wide love
It's all we need
So fall on your knees
Whoa, gosh
