Me lyrical from me born ya
Bun the fire red and yes it hotter than a sauna
Style just a chop like a proper marijuana
Grow me natty dread no afro, no Valderrama
Tour non-stop from  to Santa Barbara
Left Colorado and stop a Alabama
Mi haffi catch an international flight to Ghana
Tell dem fi put the boarding pass inna mi palm ya
Nuff a dem no like me so dem head a get warmer
If them a the snake, well me a the snake charmer
Snap a pick quick, let dem know what a gwaan ya
We a give them PTSD that a trauma
Tell them the B-E-B-B-L-E on ya
Solid as a rock when we a rock and come on ya
Touch a stage show and we haffi go perform ya
Women dem a faint tell dem we no want no drama becah...

Don't know the style and dem don't know the pattern
From New York, Manhattan to Tokyo, Japan
Flows that me lock, on the globe me a trod on
Me lyrics dem a kick like the boy weh named Zlatan
Real rastaman no take no talk nor no chat from
No crazy ballet dem get boxed with a bat an'
Haffi lyrically fit fi step on the track an'
Dem a run fi dem life, dem get overlapped an'
Dem a move like a menace, like Dennis to the Rodman
Give dem the teachings of Haile I the godman
Teach dem the truth of Kemet, which is the black land
Empress Menen personify me at an'
The mic inna me hand is like a axe to a logman
Chopping down every avertable counteraction
We inna babylon but have a plan fi extraction
But all weh me chat it in nothing Anglo-Saxon
Mek dem know seh

Nice and easy, me just keep it simple
Me sit back and watch all you buss like a pimple
Artist a rise, music sink like a dimple
Me hotter than the sun, some starboy a twinkle
Watch all the ting dem wha you nyam and weh you drink to
Nuff a dem a stray from the grid and them a swing to
What kind of  you into
The real Congo natty certain things you nah fi bring to
See we pon the mountain peak and beat the Kete drum
Fire weh me burn not a soul cyaa get we from
Touch inna di place dem a beg me fi settle down
Artists astray, but the Ras nah let you down
From Rebel Music base 2011 come straight outta 2018
Me never dun it down
In the lyrics weh me chat up inna every song
Lyrics god, ready fi start a rebellion
Me tell you know seh...
