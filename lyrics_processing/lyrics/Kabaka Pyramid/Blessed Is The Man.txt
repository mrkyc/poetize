Remember I tell you
Blessed is the man

Blessed is the man
Blessed is Selassie I (ay)
Haile...

Ithiopia stretch forth her hands and gave us the redeemer of all man
Defender of the faith, and an Ethiopian, he's the captain, the chief, field marshal, sergeant
Bowing at his feet, 72 nation, Ras Makonnen was crowned conquering lion (king)
Ababa Janhoy father of Africans with Empress Menen I stand at his right hand
Meanwhile, inna Jamaica land, whole heap a trial and tribulation
Chastisement was upon all African, Bustamante seh kill all rasta man
Wah kinda Selassie that unuh a call 'pon, trim dem and bring the whole a dem a station
Never in the name of my king of England, will I ever live to see the rasta man redemption
But when the two six clash, that's when the plane land, King of all Kings touch down in Kingston
Would you believe, so said so done, Bustamante blind, couldn't see when the King come
Some a dem deaf and mi seh some a dem dumb, when them rise up against Haile Selassie kingdom
You politician with yuh evil agenda, any how yuh diss jus' remember
You might also like
Remember I tell you
Blessed is the man
Blessed is Selassie I (Rastafari)
Memba I tell you (remember)
Blessed is the man (so blessed)
Blessed is Selassie I

Dem seh blessed is the man that walketh not inna the counsel of the vagabond dem
Selassie seh fi dash it, put the fire pon dem
Lava splash, lightening flash, thunder crash upon dem
Queen Elizabeth and dem a plan it from when, a seh Jamaica prison we a drop it pon dem
'Cah fi we prison yard, man a pack it from when
Tell Cameron seh that is not we problem
Pope Francis and all him Vatican friend, a spot we tourbus and put the tracking pon dem
A check we schedule and dem a map it from when 'thru the power of the trinity we slap it pon dem
Selassie I a God and we a God's children, eventually we grow to be Gods till then, we affi gwaan do the works wah Selassie intend
Empress Menen she a the strength fi women, divine feminine that a the vibe weh she bring
When Sec mek a sting, she destroy everything, yet still inna the womb life is within
She a di melanin absorbing light in my skin
Haile Selassie slew Goliath with the sling, Mussolini foot get tie up with the string
Dem seh them require mi fi sing, nah follow them evil agenda, beg unuh remember

Remember I tell yuh (Rastafari)
Blessed is the man
Blessed is Selassie I (Haile Selassie I)
Memba I tell you (hail him I)

Blessed is Selassie I

Ooohh (hail him I)

Blessed is the man, blessed is the man
Blessed is the man, blessed is the man
Blessed is the man, blessed is the man
Blessed is the man, blessed is the man
Blessed is the man, blessed is the man

Bablyon could never take away Jah Jah blessings, never
Rastafari goodness endureth forever, through all generations
Even in the 21st century, Ethiopia still unconquered
And the Lion of Judah still slew Goliath...
Yeah remember
Please remember, I tell yuh
So, blessed is the man
Blessed is the man
Blessed is Selassie I
