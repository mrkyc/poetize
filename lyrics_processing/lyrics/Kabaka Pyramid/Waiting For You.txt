I'm just a soul on a journey
Need to find someone to help me know where my work is
Relationship's full a ups and downs
But if you're patient, baby girl, me know say it worth it
Shed a tear, here's my kerchief
And if you don't see me cry, no bother feel say me hurtless
Obstacles me we hurdle it
And if you look your door, I've got the tools, I'm a wordsmith

Yeah, I've been waiting for you, girl
Meditating for you, girl
To find my place in this earth
To lend a  in this urge
Now, now, now
I'll been waiting for you, girl
Meditating for you, girl
And I'll been walking alone
Until I see you walk in my zone
Now, now, now

Me know say me no perfect
And me a go say some things weh mek you perplex
Dem say me egotistic
But know dem have me ego twisted
True, dem only pree the surface
When me look 'pon the book dem weh you purchase
Me see say knowledge a self kind a urgent
Your heart clean, it no need no detergent
Garden of Eden, you never get mislead by the serpent
You might also like

Meditating for you, girl
To find my place in this earth
To lend a ?? in this urge
Now, now, now
I'll been waiting for you, girl
Meditating for you, girl
And I'll been walking alone
Until I see you walk in my zone
Now, now, now

And until that day, that you walk my way
I'll be patiently holding firm, yeah
So many gone astray, with me they wanna play
Put up a sign weh say, 'don't disturb me'
You are the one for me, to keep my company
To stand beside when the tables turning
This ain't no fantasy, is you I plan to see
Over land and sea
Now, now, now, now



It's a lonely trod, you know
Until you find that one to create the perfect balance
With I and I, you know
So no make sense fi run down love, you know wha' I mean?
Yeah
No bother heed the temptation, a you me a wait 'pon
On this occasion
