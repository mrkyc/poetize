I'm just a man yeh
Accurate!

I'm just a man
Not trying to be nobody's saviour
Just be up on mi best behaviour
And never let the system break me down
I'm just a man
Not trying to be nobody's saviour
This music is my respirator
And never let no one come slave me now

Yeah yeah
I just through the love a the music
So many years weh mi suffer just fi go through this yo
Just fi deh pon the stage
The Bebble rockers a play
And then your hands a go up and a move it you
So many feel seh man a bathe inna money
But more time makin' tours not makin' no money
If me never have a band mi coulda done buy a place fi mi mommy
Still me just a wait till it coming my way
Cah me is a man weh just want a piece of land fi farm
And go breed a one woman
Voice couple songs and release it pon the fans dem fi free
That a just the least me can do man
Cah when the see the hands dem come out
When dem looking fi a dollar
Mi waan fi do it better cah dem coulda be a scholar
Or an artist performing at the Apollo
But dem still a go begging me tomorrow
Damn

I'm just a man
Not trying to be nobody's saviour
This music is my respirator
And never let no one come slave me now

I remember school days when we start up the sound
In the street with the blunts we used to walk up and down
Bang squad true that was the talk of the town
Some cute-faced gyal dem woulda always surround we
Whole heap a friend we roll deep when we step
Opportunities fi get grief get reject
And when the chalice start beat them mi get
Rastafari teachings weh mi pree seh reflect
And from that day I've been searching fi truth
Regurgitated weh mi learn in the booth
So many people in this world confused
But I could never do your work for you

'Cause I'm just a man
Not trying to be nobody's saviour
Just be up on mi best behaviour
And never let the system break me down
I'm just a man
Not trying to be nobody's saviour
This music is my respirator
And never let no one come slave me now

Yeah
Huh
I say dem nah go slave I now
Could never slave I now, yeah
Accurate, immaculate!
I'm just a man, yeh
