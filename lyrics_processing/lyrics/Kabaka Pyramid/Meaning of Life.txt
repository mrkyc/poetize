Come let us have a reasoning
It nuh matter what you believing in, now
Accurate, immaculate
Skibily bang, da one ya name

What is the meaning of life, If you only have one chance to live
Not even twice, without nuh choice
What is the meaning of life, when the earth has been around for so long, a couple billion, and mi seh
What is the meaning of life, if you only have one chance to live and some die as a kid, mi seh
What is the meaning of life, do you go to heaven and live eternally with all your bredrens, huh?

Some say we only live once, dat nuh make sense to I
Every time a new soul is born, is like dem meant to die
Some live to see hundred and one, some dead at 25
Some die as a infant, while some dem aids infesting (why?!)
Some black, some white, some rich, some poor (why?!)
Some four foot five, some six foot four
Why we all created equal and some born without feet
And some blind and some cannot speak
I guess we all a get a sequel

What is the meaning of life, If you only have one chance to live
Not even twice, without nuh choice
What is the meaning of life, when the earth has been around for so long, a couple billion, and mi seh
What is the meaning of life, if you only have one chance to live and some die as a kid, mi seh
What is the meaning of life, do you go to heaven and live eternally with all your bredrens, huh?

So many people know how to get away with murder
While so many innocent accused
If them don't get nuh justice, in this life
Then is it so absurd that in another life they get what they are due
And if you seh that God nah sleep and him nuh snooze
Then what about the little baby girl that get abused, by her father
And all the slave master weh put people through disaster
A coulda slower, or faster, dem haffi get them karma

Mi memba Christ seh that John the baptist was once Elijah
So maybe each of us beyond the grave is a survivor
And the afterlife is where you prepare for the next life
That see the good you do return and the wrongs you pay the price fah
So when you see a stranger that's feeling so familiar
They could've been your lover, or may someone that killed yuh
We always keep returning, the purpose to build you
Until the hate is gone and only love alone a fill yuh
What is the meaning of life, If you only have one chance to live
Not even twice, without nuh choice
What is the meaning of life, when the earth has been around for so long
A couple billion, and mi seh
What is the meaning of life, if you only have one chance to live
And some die as a kid, mi seh
What is the meaning of life, do you go to heaven
And live eternally with all your bredrens, huh?
