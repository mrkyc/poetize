Nah nah now, nah nah now
Them want them rebel music now
Give them some rebel music now

Well this ah rebel music, don't you confuse it
With that crap that the bulk ah them producing
This ah rebel music, don't you confuse it
Mi ah the baddest lyricist so watch me prove it
Yo, mi use to bun di weed alot
Now mi start fi read a lot
Out loud, 'bout how the system wan fi keep us
Locked up in the prison mentally them wan defeat us
In the streets weh mi feet touch
Cah the school them never teach us
Nothing bout we African features
Now them wan fi turn we into claffys and divas
Officers, preachers, doctors and lawyers and liars
The royal alliance I ah keep up
From I was a fetus from Jesus to Negus
Use to rock a reba now mi locks ah creep up
Babylon mi buss up all your kneecap
Mi grab di microphone and tell the pretty black women dem nuh fi bleach up
Nuff youths mi teach bout the knowledge
Weh mi read about
Nuff ah them grew vex ah di college
Weh mi leave out
Mi bun the bleek out
And can mek the youths ah seek out
I have a dream and it's not to own a beach house

So free the ghetto youths from the chains
Kabaka Pyramid, it is my name

So free the ghetto youths from the chains

The youths them got no way out
So we plot the lay out
Got a lot to say out
A nuh nothing fi u buss a shot an rail out
Babylon mi wah fi chop you brains out
But me rather teach the people if each one side say equal rights
We take it to equal heights
Whether you Hebrew, Israelite or Rastafarian
Weh heights up di king we take a seat up high
Just listen the lyrics them we provide
Take a seat, meditate, make sure you're breathing right
If life is a book this a reading light, 360 degrees in night

Kabaka Pyramid, it is my name
The game, it will never be the same
Rebel music ah bring the change
So free the ghetto youths from the chains
Kabaka Pyramid, it is my name

So now we start fi make them tune yah pon a regular basis
Babylon dem'a go say the rebels abrasive
Embracing my ways just face it I'm a black man in the situation weh find myself placed in
Cya get a work cause me hair no comb
Even though mi go a college wid a Florida area code
Hear you now this a hit me hard just imagine all the youths weh never go a school then
Rebel music is a educating force them devils waging war them seperating more
That's why the king me haffi rate him more
Him say the black race is pure

Kabaka Pyramid, it is my name
The game, it will never be the same
Rebel music ah bring the change
So free the ghetto youths from the chains
Kabaka Pyramid, it is my name
The game, it will never be the same
Rebel music ah bring the change
So free the ghetto youths, so free the ghetto youths, yow
