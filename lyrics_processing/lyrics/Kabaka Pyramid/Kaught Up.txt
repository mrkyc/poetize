You got me caught up
Now I wanna know what it feels to be loved by someone like you
I've been all around and I've seen many girls, but

You got me caught up in the moment
Before I met you, my heart was frozen
Man a straight shooter like Derozan
Many were called but you were chosen

You have a style weh me like
And a body weh me love
And you light just a shine like the stars up above
Nuff a dem come a hype, you dem a grudge
Cah you skin so smooth, it no got not a smudge
Buy you owna things and you nah tek no talk
And no guy cyaan match weh you got inna your vault
That no compare to the love inna yoru heart
You mek me all a laugh cah' me...

Caught up in the moment
Before I met you, my heart was frozen
Man a straight shooter like Derozan
Many were called but you were chosen
You were chosen
You might also like
And me no really think you know just what you do to me
It's like you stuck inna me mind and this is new to me
And now me friend dem just a tell me dem no used to this
Me would a love it if you could a bear a youth for me
No fake this, no fake that, you stay true to me
So when you wake up in the morning you still cute to me
And then you ready fi go gi' me what is due to me...

You got me caught up in the moment
Before I met you, my heart was frozen
Man a straight shooter like Derozan
Many were called but you were chosen
You just bulldoze dem

You got me caught up, feeling like I'm starstruck, baby
Looking in your eyes got me hypnotized, maybe
The look you gave me on the dancefloor changed me
Now my palm's all sweaty and my hand's all shakey
Yep, I call this living in the moment
Stars are aligned I'mma listen to the omen
I'm having visions of you holding me
So can you know this please, you got me
Caught up in the moment
Before I met you, my heart was frozen
Man a straight shooter like Derozan
Many were called but you were chosen
You were chosen, yeah

You got me caught up
Now I wanna know what it feels to be loved by someone like you
I've been all around and I've seen many girls, but

You got me caught up in the moment
Before I met you, my heart was frozen
Man a straight shooter like Derozan
