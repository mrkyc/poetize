Is there a better place
(Cast into the open, with nowhere else to go)
I feel right now that I could rest my bones
Or should I stay awake
(Tired of going in circles, trying to stay alive)
(Because it keeps on working, that don't make it right)
I'll try anything that could somehow free me from
The ball and chain
If I can hold out, for I've nowhere else to run
Or person to blame
I may be weary, but I'm on my feet again
On my feet again
I had a love that I could call my own
But I had no choice
(Who's afraid of nothing, must be clinging to the vine)
Clinging to the vine
(Because it keeps on working, that don't make it right)
(Because it keeps on working, that don't make it right)
Don't make it right
(Because it keeps on working, that don't make it right)
I raise my head high and make a toast to the fallen saints
Bless their souls
It's been a long ride
We've all endured some aches and pains
Heaven knows
Could have been easier, but misery loves me so
Yes, she loves me so
