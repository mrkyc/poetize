Put me baby in the county jail
Do my time, lord, and i won't tell
Everybody, everybody going to hell
Pick back my fat, skin my bones
Thirty-two teeth crack throwing stones
Call on jesus, bring us home
I ain't done nothing but love
I ain't done nothing but... hey love
All hands are calling the maker
Dirty with the salt from the undertaker
Damn, i hear john the revalator
Mama's in the kitchen dancing and singing
All hands are calling the maker
Dirty with the salt from the undertaker
Damn, i hear john the revalator
Mama's in the kitchen dancing and singing
Get my money back, i pay my bail
Put me baby, put me baby in the county jail
Do my time, lord, and i won't tell
On everybody going to hell
Pick back my fat, skin my bones
Your teeth crack throwing stones
Call on jesus, bring us home
I ain't done nothin' but love
I ain't done nothin' but love

White witch playing on a tree trunk gong
