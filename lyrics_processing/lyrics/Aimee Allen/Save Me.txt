I'm gonna ride this out
My little girl heart breaks apart
From your big mouth
And I'm sick, of my sickness
Don't touch me, you'll get this
I'm useless, lazy, perverted
And you hate me
Chorus:
But you can't save me
You can't change me
I'm waiting for my wake up call
And everything, everything's my fault
Went to the doctor, and I asked her
To make this stop
Got medication, a new addiction
Thanks a lot
I had a relapse, I'm bad at rehab
Ruins everything
So point your finger at the singer
She's in the pharmacy

You can't save me
You can't change me
I'm waiting here for my wake up call
And everything's my fault
And you can't save me
You can't blame me
I'm waiting here to take the fall
Singing everything, everything's my fault
Oh, oh oh oh oh, It's all my fault
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm a death treat, haven't slept yet
Baby, why the wake up call?
I'm the bad girl, tell the whole world
Everything's my fault, oh oh oh oh
Yeah, write it, write it, oh oh oh oh
Everything's my fault, oh oh oh oh
It's all my fault, oh oh oh oh
I went to Heaven, I couldn't get in
For what I have done
I said, 'Please take me', they said 'You're crazy'
You had too much fun
Chorus:
But you can't save me
You can't change me
I'm waiting here for my wake up call
And everything's my fault
And you can't save me
You can't blame me
I'm waiting here to take the fall
Singing everything, yes everything's my fault
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (It's all my, it's all my)
It's all my
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (It's all my, it's all my)
It's all my fault
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (It's all my, it's all my)
