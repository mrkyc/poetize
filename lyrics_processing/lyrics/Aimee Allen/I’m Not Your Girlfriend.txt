You sweat upon my sheets and then you run
But I'm not done
You tell me I'm the one
Just long enough to come
You think I'm dumb
You think I'm dumb
I lose you every day
And I know I'm getting played
But I'm having fun
Let's have some
Let's have some fun
I'm not your girlfriend
I don't have to call
I don't want to need you
I am not your girlfriend
You don't have to call
I don't want to need you
I just want to-
I just want tonight
I fuck you then I leave
You dare to question me
Before I run
You come undone
I tell you you're the one
Just long enough to come
You think I'm dumb
You think I'm dumb
You might also likeI lose you every day
And you know you're getting played
But you're having fun
Let's have some
I'm not your girlfriend
I don't have to call
I don't want to need you
I am not your girlfriend
You don't have to call
I don't want to need you
I just want to-
I just want tonight
When I'm done
I'll let you know
I want you
To come and go
When I'm done
I'll let you know
I want you
To come and go
I don't want your number
I don't want your last name
I don't want to meet your mother
Unless she's better or the same
Just stand there don't be gun shy
Just be dangerous say goodbye
I'll be okay I'll be alright
I just want you for tonight
I don't have to call
I don't want to need you
I am not your girlfriend
You don't have to call
I don't want to need you
I just want tonight
Tonight
I just want tonight
Come and go
Come and go
Come and go
