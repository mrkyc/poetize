Revolution (ost. Birds of Prey)
Hey kids, rock 'n' roll
That's how I lost control
Hey kids, go get high
I can't remember why
Up all night, I waste my time
I am fine, but a day behind
Up all night feelin' stupid 'n' happy
But the days are overlapping
My days are overlapping...
I'd start a revolution
If I could get up in the morning
I'd start a revolution
If I could get up, get up
Start a revolution
Start a revolution
If I could get up, get up
Start a revolution
Start a revolution
If I could get up in the morning...
Hey, every day is the weekend
I stay up, so I sleep in
Hey, everyday there's a reason
To just do it all over again
Up all night, I waste my time
I am fine, but a day behind
Up all night feelin' stupid 'n' happy
But the days are overlapping
My days are overlapping...
I'd start a revolution
If I could get up in the morning
I'd start a revolution
If I could get up, get up
Start a revolution
Start a revolution
If I could get up, get up
Start a revolution
Start a revolution
If I could get up in the morning
If i could get up in the morning
Get up, get up, get up
Get up in the morning
Get up, get up, get up
All the things I do
That you tell me not to
Try walkin' in my shoes
But you stumble, don't you?
4-5-6 a.m
I'm up all night again
I'd start a revolution
If I could...
I'd start a revolution
If I could get up, get up
Start a revolution
Start a revolution
If I could get up in the morning
Start a revolution
Start a revolution
If I could get up in the morning
I'd start a revolution
Get up in the morning
I'd start a revoluiton
If I could get up in the morning
I'd start a revolution
I'd start a revolution
