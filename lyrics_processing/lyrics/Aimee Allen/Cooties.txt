They came from way far out in outer space
She's hardly missing so they landed on her face

She's got cooties, cooties
They've found a place to nest
She's got cooties, cooties
If I were her I'd be depressed
Long-tailed, sharp-nailed, fuzzy legs, laying eggs
Oh no, get 'em!

In science class, she's like a walking show-and-tell
Her pet skunk ran away 'cause it couldn't take the smell

She's got cooties, cooties
Nobody wants to sit by her
(She's got cooties, cooties) She don't need a coat 'cause she's got fur
Circle, circle, dot, dot, dot
Glad I got my cootie shot
Come on boys, let's stamp 'em out

Cooties, cooties
Come on, boys
Cooties, cooties
Cooties, cooties
Come on, boys
You might also like
Oh, oh, no-no, no
She's got cooties
She's just as friendly as can be
She's got cooties
She shows them cootie hospitality
She's got cooties
She's like a living twilight zone
She's got cooties
Quick uh, can you get Rod Serling on the phone?

Black, white, red, green, every color in between
Dresses like a circus clown, somebody oughta hose her down
Grew up in a cootie zoo, I bet her two-ton mama's got 'em too
She-she's coming!

(She's got cooties)
Somebody oughta hose her down
(She's got cooties) Oh yeah, ooh!
(She's got cooties)
Somebody oughta hose her down
(She's got cooties) Yeah, yeah

She's got cooties
She's just as friendly as can be
She's got cooties
She shows them cootie hospitality
She's got cooties
This girl is sure to catch your eye
She's got cooties
She surely like to let her freak flag fly
Come on boys, let's dance (She's got cooties), let's stamp 'em out
Come on boys, let's dance (She's got cooties), let's stamp 'em out
Come on boys, let's dance (She's got cooties), let's stamp 'em out
Come on boys, let's dance (She's got cooties), let's stamp 'em out

Black, white, red, green, every color in between
Dresses like a circus clown, somebody oughta hose her down
Grew up in a cootie zoo
