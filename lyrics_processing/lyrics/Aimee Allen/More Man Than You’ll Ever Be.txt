More than me, you told me so
Your Jesus pushed me out the door
You took your love now take my war
More man, more man
Mo-mo-mo-mo
More man than you'll ever be
I'm tired and I'm bleeding, but I'm following my gut
You're following the leader, rather die than not keep up
You bottle up so nicely just like all the frat boys
Listen to your singing, pretty singing I call noise
Serve protect your suspect, guilty 'til proved innocent
We all know little boys never question government
Nothing's fair, nothing's fair, nothing's fair in love and war
Can't believe I left her, you just spit me on the floor
Shut your mouth and swallow this down
My finger's down the throat of your small town
Go, go, give up for me
I'm more man, woman than you'll ever be
Generic, generic, show me how you rock
You're nothing special, sucking corporate radio cock
You think you're 'fraid of me? Well, you're afraid of yourself
I'm a thinker, big dreamer, you're like everyone else
You're boxed in, frozen in a simple mind, fine
But I'm the one who's stupid wasteing all of my time
We were in love, that's how it was, see how you forget
You need a christian rock virgin, out to get you head
You might also likeShut your mouth and swallow this down
My finger's down the throat of your small town
Go, go, give up for me
I'm more man, woman than you'll ever be
More man, more man
You're everything I love to hate
My own private, please stay
You're everything I love to hate
My own private, please... stay
Please stay
Please stay
Please stay
Please stay
Please stay
Ugh
Shut your mouth and swallow this down
My finger's down the throat of your small town
Go, go, give up for me
I'm more man, woman than you'll ever be
(Go, go)
More man than you'll ever be
More man, more man than you'll ever be
More...
(Go, go)
Man than you'll ever be
More, more
(Go, go)
More man than you'll ever be
More man, more man than you'll ever be
More... man than you'll ever be
