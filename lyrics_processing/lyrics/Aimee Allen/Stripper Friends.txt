All my ex-boyfriends
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing
Daddies in the bars
Reaching up for stars
We all want the same thing
Doesn't matter what you need
To get you through your day
If you buy it or just sell it
Or just give it away
It's the same at the end of the day
Doesn't matter if you pray
Or you just got pray
Songs are spinning in your head
And they just won't stop playing
It's the same at the end of the day
All my stripper friends
All my ex-boyfriends
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing
Daddies in the bars
Reaching up for stars
We all want the same thing
(We all want the same thing)
You might also likeDoesn't matter if they care
Or if they don't care less
You got your finger on the trigger
Of your favorite black dress
It's okay at the end of the day
Doesn't matter if you're reaching up
For all the stars
Or if you find them buying drinks
For you in the bars
It's okay at the end of the day
All my stripper friends
All my ex-boyfriends
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing
Daddies in the bars
Reaching up for stars
We all want the same thing
All my stripper friends
All my ex-girlfriends
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing
Folks in this small town
Beat boys under ground
We all want the same thing
We all want to live
We all want to learn
How to love without getting burned
We want to be loved
Are we good enough?
All my stripper friends
All my ex-boyfriends
We all want the same thing
