There's a little girl-girl-girl-girl-girl just a-swingin'

Let's think about it here just for a second
Ain't nothin' better than a country girl I reckon
Been around the world and I've been checkin'
Better listen close to this redneckin'
Sittin' on the front porch do a little courtin'
Radio bumpin', John and Colt Ford 'n'
Little remixin', now it's bangin'
Come on everybody let's do some swingin'

There's a little girl in our neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson and she's really lookin' good
I had to go and see her, so I called her on the phone
I walked over to her house and this was goin' on
Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie
Her mama was in the kitchen, cuttin' chicken up to fry
Daddy was in the backyard. rollin' up a garden hose
I was on the porch with Charlotte, feelin' love down to my toes

And we were swingin', (Swingin') yeah just a-swingin' (Swingin')
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin')

Now, Charlotte, she's a darlin', she's the apple of my eye
When I'm on the swing with her, she makes me almost high
Charlotte is my lover, and she has been since the spring
Just can't believe it started on her front porch in this swing

We were swingin', (Swingin') yeah just a-swingin' (Swingin')
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on the front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin')

Sittin' there swingin', stars that shinin'
Take another sip of some good time shinin'
Get a little closer, now we're cookin'
Steal a little kiss when no one's lookin'
Country lovin', turtle dovein'
My heart's singin', sure love swingin'
Come on country girl let's do our thing
Big John gon' sing and we gon' swing

Swingin' (Swingin'), yeah just a swingin' (Swingin')
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin'), yeah just a swingin' (Swingin')
Yeah, just a swingin' (Swingin')
Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin')
I said Little Charlotte, she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swing
Just a-swingin' (Swingin', swingin')
