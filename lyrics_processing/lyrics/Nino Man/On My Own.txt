Gotta go and get that bag, what you on?
Mama grinding when my dad wasn't home
Had to go get that cash on my own
Now I'm running up a tab on my own
I got all this pressure on me
And I got all these hustlers on me
And you know a check is on me
You won't even know if the  on me

Fuck friends, I'm tagging alone
I'm winning, get that bag on my own
 tryna drag me on
Cause I be  off that  and Patrone
I get it lit
Cause I'm the shit
Look at me now
Smuggling bricks
Fly to the next
I'm on the blocks
Serving the feends
Ducking the cops
Keeping it clean
Cluching the Glock
Fuck up the scene
 on the opps
Get in between
I'm  shots
Since I been doing good, they been doing extra hating
I been getting bread, go check the expiration
Went and got it on my own instead of waiting
When I dropped out of school, my mother said "you better make it"
You better take it, let these niggas hear that real shit
That's why to this day I'm always gonna talk that real shit
Always been a trapper, before I became a rapper
Shit I'm not an actor, hit a bitch, you gotta smack her

And you know a check is on me
You won't even know if the  on me

Had to learn how to stash on my own
Used to get it with the mask and the chroam
Nigga get a little cash, then he think he grown
Running up will get you splashed in the dome
I got all this pressure on me
More that you spend, less you gon see
All you can be is the best you gon be
Took what I made, invested on me
Could never predict what tomorrow is gon be
The clip is still full, but the foreign is on E
Everything else is irelevent
Just don't let your emotions  your intelligence

Gotta go and get that bag, what you on?
