Nino Man

Nobody was usin' these instrumentals til' I made it official (nope)

I feel like a re'd up an finished in 2 days (yup)
Wearin' some new J's (yup), truies, cool greys (wooo)
See I'm Harlem all day, I'll admit I barely had shit (naw)
Drove my mother crazy everyday I got my ass whipped (facts)

Slow money's no money, I'm tryina be the fastest (juuuu heard)
Niggas kept they distance from me with no involvement (word)
But now they tryina get in the picture they photo bombin' (haaaa)

Then when you step your game up they be mad at you (word)
They fakin' the funk, I take it and shrug
