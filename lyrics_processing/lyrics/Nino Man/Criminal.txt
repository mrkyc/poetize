Yuh, Nino Man

I'm a motherfuckin' criminal
I'm a motherfuckin' criminal
I'm a motherfuckin' criminal

You can't judge a nigga 'til you find out what my life like, I'm a criminal
And I can't trust a nigga 'cause I know I ain't livin' life right 'cause I'm a criminal

Uh, I ain't here to tell you who's who and who isn't (I'm not)
But I'm from the hood so I move a lil' different (Yuh)
See, I'd rather go to job sites and start applyin'
I'd rather hit the block with hard white and start supplyin'
'Cause I'm a mother fuckin' criminal (Yap)
I got no time to apply for them interviews (Yap)
I'd rather hit the block and go grind with the generals
You can't look at us the same way, we not identical (Nah)
I'm not here to judge nobody, this is me (No)
These niggas ain't used to outside, I'm from the streets (Facts)
They say they call shots but call cops when it's beef
But we carry more Glocks so call S.W.A.T., not police
I'm a motherfuckin' criminal and wifey know it too (Yuh)
My side bitch stepped it up, now wifey number two (Yuh)
She said she feel some kinda way, I feel offended too
But I told her I don't even give a fuck 'cause I'm a criminal (Curve)

I got a job at the bank, 'bout motherfuckin' time
Now I'm 'bout go to rob that motherfucker blind
I can't help it, grimy shit is always on my mind
When you get a little change, niggas always droppin' dimes
It's always dumb moments when these niggas see you shine
Fuck a man to a bitch 'cause we out committin' crimes
I'm a motherfuckin' criminal and no I'm not pretendin'
I speed down Lenox like my license ain't suspended
But fuck jail time 'cause I heard you could get sentenced
But it ain't mandatory, it's just highly recommended
I thought I learned my lesson when I did that lil' bid or two
Came home, did the same shit 'cause I'm a criminal
Got a court date but I ain't goin', I'm a criminal
'Cause if I go to trial, I might blow it, I'm a criminal
I don't give a fuck so understand what I'm sayin'
They put me on child support, I'm never gonna pay it
I take care of mines, they could keep sendin' payments
So fuck they affidavits and all they payment arrangements
I do what I want without askin' niggas
What the fuck niggas thought? I'm a ratchet nigga
I don't care how you feel if you think that move pitiful
I ain't never gonna give a fuck 'cause I'm a criminal
I'm a motherfuckin' criminal
I'm a motherfuckin' criminal
I'm a motherfuckin' criminal
I'm a motherfuckin' criminal

You can't judge a nigga 'til you find out what my life like, I'm a criminal
And I can't trust a nigga 'cause I know I ain't livin' life right 'cause I'm a criminal

Yeah, I'm a motherfuckin' criminal
International but I wasn't wanted by INTERPOL
Bally shoes on, Bally dinner coat
Work on deck then the homies lookin' to rent a boat
From the West side to the East side
Backseat, gun out makin' the police drive
I know the plug that your plug use
Your outleted from an outlet that let the gun shoot
Met they acquaintances with some train robbers and some wild ass niggas that'll run up in the bank and shit
Me? I'm a work mover, stick-up kid, first shooter
I don't like your wave then a bullet'll probably surf through ya
Nino Man, Space Ghost
Whether it's the work or the gun, I keep the tape close
I wanna kill a nigga but I wait first
Go 'head and move that weight first
Then I give 'em wait work
