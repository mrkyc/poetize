I can't believe I made it this far
But I was just tryna work hard
'Cause I started with nothing, yeah
I started with nothin', yeah
I can't believe I made it this far
But I was just tryna work hard
'Cause I started with nothin', yeah
I started with nothin', yeah
I told 'em believe in my grind
But people didn't pay me no mind
'Cause I started with nothin', yeah
I started with nothin', yeah

Wish my mother could see me right now
Wish my grandmas could see me right now
I'd do anything to see they smile
Rest in peace, I ain't see them in a while
Since my moms died I've been on my own
Lil' nigga holdin' down home
A teenager feeling like he grown
I'm too deep to feel like I'm alone
Do you remember?
I was makin' cassette tapes, do you remember?
How you said I should've pressed play, but you would never
Give me a chance, but rather listen what you call it
Sometimes the people close to you is the least supportive
I'm wishin' on shinin' stars and reaching for them
Real niggas live through me and I'm speakin' for them
Curb the bullshit and just stack paper
'Cause niggas don't help you, they just want favors
All of that fake love shit is what I don't like
Strangers show more love than people I knew my whole life
I still hit the block, smoke weed and role dice
Hungry for success even on a slow night
You might also like
I can't believe I made it this far
But I was just tryna work hard
'Cause I started with nothin', yeah
I started with nothin', yeah
I told 'em believe in my grind
When people didn't pay me no mind
'Cause I started with nothin', yeah
