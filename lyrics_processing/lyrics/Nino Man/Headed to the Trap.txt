Never trust a nigga that can never get his cash right
Fuckin' up his bread cuz he be tryna live the fast life
Homie claim he broke but always higher than the gas price
They ain't give me mo- wait, look
They ain't give me money so I went and got my own shit
They ain't share they weed, I had to go and get my own zips
On the corner givin' fiends a sample so my phone click
When they leave I guarantee they come back like they homesick
OT, with a quarter brick, I need all of that
Duckin', football, never tryna bring this quarter back
Niggas say my ex a freak, fuck you think who taught her that?
Bitches don't curve me, I just never call them back
Lotta people broke, it's a joke, shit ain't funny and
Don't say you wanna trap if it ain't no money here
Gotta go through them dark days till the sunny end
Stacked up, 12 months, straight up had a bummy year

Headed to the trap, I'm really tryna get my bands up
Niggas, they be talkin', I just told em get them grams up
Yeah, I got my hands up
Yeah, I got bananas
You run up on me, Imma have em shootin' at your nana

Gotta keep the code while I'm on the road, doin' shows
Tryna get this dough, I be stackin' cake runnin' late
These niggas fake I told em, "Get up out my fuckin' face"
It's so much pain I swear these niggas they just can't relate
Out of state, I'm just really tryna get my bag right
Mad ice, bitches be like "Lil Tjay mad nice"
I'm in the lab and I'm just cookin' like I'm Walter White
I'm off the Sprite, you run up on me, Imma off ya life
I ain't playin' games now, I ain't sayin' names
You run up on me I might have to put you on a chain
Call the gang, they gon bang, and that shit gon be the same
I'm a Stain, see my chain?
Couple thousand in my mane

Headed to the trap, I'm really tryna get my bands up
Niggas, they be talkin', I just told em get them grams up
Yeah, I got my hands up
Yeah, I got bananas
You run up on me, Imma have em shootin' at your nana

Headed to the trap, I'm really tryna get them bands up
Keep the pockets full, it's hard for me to keep my pants up
Cops be tryna jam us, Judge wanna remand us
