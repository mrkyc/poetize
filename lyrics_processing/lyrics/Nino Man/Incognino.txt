They ask me where I get the hunger from, it's funny (Why?)
I ain't get it from nowhere, I really was hungry (Facts)
If I did somethin' illegal then I needed the money (Word)
I'm tryna break bread, look, no need to be buddies (Nah)
Livin' with my moms, four brothers was fuckin' brutal (Word)
We was doin' bad, they ain't bring us a Cup of Noodles (Nah)
Joints that used to curve wanna come back then wanna do you
And Netflix & chill but I told her I fuck with Hulu
Call me Kyrie Curvin'
Wasn't feelin' the drive, now I be swervin'
When they left I said, "I'll be servin' to every fiend I see till I find my earnings" (Juu Hurd)
Did everything I supposed to (Mm)
'Cause they ain't gonna put you in the game or coach you (Nah)
You heard I was pop, it's so true
Ain't have a piggybank, if I did, that shit'll be broke too (That's crazy)
I remember the days I was pop
Pissed off, I couldn't afford the J's when they dropped
Clothes was dingy, I had stains in my socks
Couldn't pay for a cab, I took train to the block
I talk about the struggle so I can motivate niggas that's just like me (Just like me)
'Cause if you think it's over then it just might be (It just might be)
Gotta visualize the main goal and just write heat (Just write heat)
If you take this shit serious, you just might see
Go hard with no fear
They all could be talkin' shit about me, I don't care
When you're doing somethin' that they're not, they go weird
Pay them no mind, let 'em stay with their broke peers
They hate the god so they gotta be devils
You got off on the wrong floor, you not on my level
Cookin' on the stove right next to the kettle
They waitin' on me like a lawsuit that's 'bout to be settled
Don't compare me to fam, the love different
I robbed, I scammed, I ran the drug business
How can I dub pitchin'?
Connect like the outlets out the country
Just know that my plug different (That's different)
Nino Man from them blocks in Harlem
Don't care if you don't like me, that's not my problem (Word)
'Cause I'm always showin' love and that's not gon' solve 'em (Mm)
So Glocks I palm 'em, fuck the cops, I dodge 'em (Juu Hurd)
I'm focused on the glow (Word)
Anybody try to throw me off gotta go (Bye)
That includes family, friends, and the hoes (Word)
Curvin' anything that tries to fuck up the goals
It's slow!
