Streets is crazy

It's a lota bullshit goin' on in my city (yup)
Shit could get ugly if you tryina look pretty (yup)
That's why I keep the hammer on me so they don't get me (facts)
The 40 got my pants saggin' like it don't fit me (woooo)
Listen money the root of all evil, but we plantin the seeds
I was 8 years old and couldn't stand the police
Look I do it for the hood I like the lamp wit the G's
I can't wait to cop a private jet an land in them P's (juuuu heard)
It's a lota funny shit goin on I'm not jackin' it (naww)
That's why I keep my gun off safety, I like clappin' it
Came home left the game, went right back in it
Some shit just don't chance that's quite accurate
The more you get old the more you gotta watch your back though
Heart get colder every time you let the strap go
Friends killin' friends can't believe they was that close
Who woulda thought that because of money niggas would stoop that low (damn)
Talk behind my back they be thirst tellin' me (yup)
Beefin with a friend is worse than your worst enemy (yup)
I was 17 when I caught my first felony
Lemme break it down for you I convert memories
So you could understand an feel like you in it
Listen to every bar you gonna feel like you lived it (wooo)
A nigga got you for all of ya dough
How he set you up an he was jus callin' you broke, But oh
A nigga was jus with you in the dope house (dope house)
Then they tryina get you cuz you broke now (broke now)
Hang yourself somebody bring the rope out (rope out)
Try to cut throat on me I'm cuttin' throats out
I came from the hood where you can't chill or play (naw)
Where niggas steal iPhones at and kill for J's (damn)
I'm used to this shit people still amazed (word)
I had people close to me put in their graves
So rest in peace Chinx we all know how wrong this is
I'm sorry for your lose French y'all got my condolences
The streets don't love nobody it's just lust
That's why I only fuck wit my niggas it's just us (us)
That bitch don't look that good it's jus blush
These niggas got that stank it's jus must (ahh ahhh)
Y'all niggas don't shoot y'all guns y'all shits rust
If money talk, talk your shit lets discuss (juuuu heard)
NIggas can't make it out the hood no more, out the hood no more (naw)
Everybody beefin' wit each other shit ain't good no more (word), shit ain't good no more (word)
All these grimy niggas out here goin' bananas
That's why I only feel safe when I got the hammer
It's sad cuz it could put me right back in the slammer
But that like life you live in the hood bein' a rapper
