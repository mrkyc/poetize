What you heard?
Nino Man Harlem
Ya ready?
Saint John's, look

Yo, since they didn't believe I'ma make them pay
I'ma eat in front of their face and won't make a plate
If I do it it's on purpose, I don't make mistakes
Who want beef I'ma grab the heat and make a steak
I'ma leave a clown well done and soon as his shells dumb
Got so many hammers I'm ready to sell some
Stop it who I'm fooling I won't even sell one
You could always use extra who know how to spell run
'Cause when them shots fired, better run like you not tired
In your hood out the next day a whole block quiet
This new .44 alone stop riots
We don't need no chemistry, this is not science
Tell Flex play some Nino Man, don't be missing out
Keep you ears to the streets Flex please listen out
The love people dishing out, it was like this amount
So I'ma keep rapping in this bitch 'til they kick me out
Whiling I'll be standing up sleep like a cone head
I'll be writing raps in my notes 'til my phone dead
I was in Miami thinking raps on a moped
Wondering when I get back how I'ma get some mo' bread
Grew up listening to the radio, now I'm on it
Barely had a bike as a kid, now I'm in foreigns
Hammers leave a convoy drenched like it was pouring
All the dudes around me either on the run or got warrants
I'm a different breed Flex, I'm in a different league
Hitch had to box me and Flex I had to stick and weave
They know I'm with the G's and they got some shit to squeeze
I get a rat killed as soon as he sniffed the cheese
Listen B, I grew on up Lenox Ave, you was never there
If I say ayy, hard blows gon' be everywhere
L in the loss, never worry, yeah, we heavy here
If I see a snake I'ma turn his shit to Metal Gear
Started off with scraps and pennies, now they see me stacking Benjis
I don't care what faggots envy long as they know that's a fendy
When I was broke some people had it, didn't ask for any
Now all of a sudden I'm Hollywood in an accidenty
Keep it a buck don't try to be no pretender
You know what I had to sacrifice to be a winner
I chose to put my life on the line, than be a quitter
Know how many times I ate peanut butter and jelly for dinner
I didn't think so, your lonesome being bitter
I was a good kid but I was forced to be a sinner
'Cause back then my mom's had a lot of back rent
So I had to find out the value that the crack went
While y'all was in the crib playing tic tac toe
I was outside trapping tryna get that dough
They having snowball fights, I'm tryna flip that snow
I know money talk but I ain't tryna chit chat though
Right now everybody in Harlem got this on blast Flex
Even got Saint John's mob and all on that add Flex
All of these other rappers is corny, I think they mad Flex
Always screaming out independent but wish they had Flex
I wish my mom's could see me right now
I could see her in her room chilling in her night gown
Finally her young son is in the light now
I'm about to take off, I'm booking the flight now
Shout out to my mom's, you my favorite
I just want to tell you three words "I made it"
You not here to see it but your son is getting famous
And those fake friends you told me to watch started hating
But now I'm on vacations, to get out people's faces
It's all about green, you damn right I'm racist
People hit me up so much it's getting more real
So real they try to call my phone while it on air
Showed no support claiming they was all there
Before the buzz I didn't get a text the whole year
But anyway I got real ones I'm close with
Real ones I smoke with and real ones that smoke shit
I be getting focused, tryna get emotion
You always tryna jump ship, now you want an ocean
Look Flex peepers Nino Man's a good vote
Someone talking funny about me must be a good joke
He better swallow his pride or he gon' get choked
'Cause after I'm done with money he gon' look broke
Leave it up to the gram, they all ballers
I seen you outside with your fam in a Ford Taurus
First you gotta grind and have flows and more order
Look to get in this game you need more than four quarters
Look, I was tryna kick back, sit back
Conversate with y'all about some big stacks, if that
Reminisce when I was going crazy when Kiss rapped
What about the tunnel album rest in piece big cat
I be tryna get racks, I ain't tryna get rapped
So whoever thought I fell of this the get back
I did a lot for the money even the savage days
I was in my bag so heavy I'd need baggage claim
Everything was straight until the baggies came
Want the money, y'all can have the fame
Built the money on violence, better respect your jaw
Growing up on Lenox, aw, damn, B, hold up
