No home

This is not any form of home
Home, home is where the heart is
No home, no heart
No home, no heart

This is your viewing room
Your room, no view
Nothing seen, nothing heard
Your home, no heart

Can (I don't know what it means)
You (I've lived here for so long)
Trust me? (and I can't leave now, I can't leave)
Can you trust me? (I can't leave you)
Can you trust me? (no, I can't leave you)
Again (I've been here for so long)
Can you (it's always been my way)
Trust me? (and it's always been the way to be like myself)
Again (now you want me to change)
Can you trust me anymore? (I can't change to you)
Can you trust me anymore? (I can't change, I can't change for you)
Can we just be enemies? (I've lived here for so long)
Can we just be enemies? (I can't change)
Can we just be enemies? (so long sometimes)
Can we just be enemies? (even though you've said goodbye so many times)
