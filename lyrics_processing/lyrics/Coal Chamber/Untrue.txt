Where have you been?
I've been here
Waiting, anticipating
Coping with tears
Where have you been?

You've been untrue
I've seen it before and I see it again
You've been untrue
I've seen it before and I see it again
You've been untrue
I've seen it before and I see it again
You've been untrue
I've seen it before and I see it again

It's quite clear now
Your phone rang all night
I waited here
Waiting anticipating
Coping with fear
Where have you been?

You've been untrue
I've seen it before and I see it again
You've been untrue
I've seen it before and I see it again
You've been untrue
I've seen it before and I see it again
You've been untrue
I've seen it before and I see it again
