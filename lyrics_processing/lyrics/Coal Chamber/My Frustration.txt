Where was I when God had shown
How to make a happy home?
And where was I when God had shown
How to make a happy home?
God, make

Lie in bed and sleep don't come
Have some peace then give me some
And I know the reason why you hold me down
I won't let this fear of loss make me drown
In my bed I lie alone
Scrape together bone to bone
And I can't seem to seem to find my way
I can't seem to find the break of day

I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away

Where was I when God had shown
How to make a happy home?
And I have become my worst enemy
I will survive this instability

Scrape together bone to bone
Again I have become my worst enemy
I will survive this instability

I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away

I need to breathe the breath of life
You constantly drain my life
Why can't you see the breath in me
I constantly need your need
My butterfly don't fly away
My butterfly don't fly away
My butterfly don't fly away
My butterfly don't fly away

If I could just take this simple breath of life from me
You couldn't take it motherfucker, eternity
If I could take this breath of life and come inside of me
You wouldn't take it, I need to breathe
As I creep the monkey's back
Now she's gone and oh he's back
And I know the reason why you hold me down
I won't let this fear of loss make me drown
In my bed I lie alone
Scrape together bone to bone
And I can't seem to seem to find my way
I can't seem to find the break of day

I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away
I'll stay just a step away

I will stay, I'll stay a step away
I will stay, I'll stay a step away
I will stay, I'll stay
