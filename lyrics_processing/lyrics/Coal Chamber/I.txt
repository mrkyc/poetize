I let down through the breakthrough
I travel as I hunger for the darkness below me
When I'm praying for the light above (I)
To save this soul inside me
I let down through the breakthrough
I travel as I hunger for the darkness below me
When I'm praying for the light above (I)
To save this soul inside me (I)

Should I? I
Would I? I
Could I? I

Outcast from my own kind never knowing (I)
Soaring through my own mind never knowing (I)
How could they live with what they're doing (I)
Twist of my spine (I)
Outcast from my own kind never knowing (I)
Soaring through my own mind never knowing (I)
How could they live with what they're doing (I)
Twist of my spine (I)

Should I? I
Would I? I
Could I? I
Could I?
Should I? I
Would I? I
Could I? I
Could I?

Oh God, fuck

I don't get it, I-I don't get it
I don't get it, I-I don't get it
I don't get it, I-I don't get it
I don't get it, I-I don't get it
Breathe with me
Just breathe with me

It's up to me as I hunger (just breathe with me)
Lay slow and still as I wonder (just breathe with me)
Pray for darkness down in this hollow
But I try to grope
It's up to me as I hunger (just breathe with me)
Lay slow and still as I wonder (just breathe with me)
Pray for darkness down in this hollow
But I try to grope
It's up to me as I sleep again (just breathe with me)
My body lays down as I holler (just breathe with me)
It's all inside but I confess in me
I like me

Should I? Would I? Could I?
