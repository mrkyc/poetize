Godless lot, it's not a lot
But it's my lot in life
No fear is my weakness I hear
When faith has been denied
Godless lot, it's not a lot
But it's my lot in life
No fear is my weakness I hear
When faith has been denied

Walkin' through sticks usin' walkin' sticks
I've stuck to this so long
What I feel is so hard to deal
So I say, "So long"
Walkin' through sticks usin' walkin' sticks
I've stuck to this so long
What I feel is so hard to deal
So I say, "So long"
