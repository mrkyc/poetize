Keep my enemies close to me
And I've been watching you closely
Yes, I despise you mostly, yes you
You think you're tall for dogging me
You're small you see, a wannabe
A mirror of me is stolen, identity

Why'd I do it?
You drove me to it
Why'd I do it?
You drove me to it
Why'd I do it?
You drove me to it
Why'd I do it?
You drove me to it

You think you're tall for dogging me
You're small you see, a wannabe
A mirror of me is stolen, identity
Keep my enemies close to me
And I've been watching you closely
Yes, I despise you mostly, yes you
