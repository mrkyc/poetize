There's a point in time when you can't think for yourself

I'm placeable
Listen to the dreams you're dreaming
Untraceable
Tell me now what are you scheming?
I'm placeable
To the place where you most fear
Untraceable
So help me dear

I'm placeable
Innate yet surely substantial
To repay your fade-away
Sweetness smells so sweet
At your feet
Just to repay your fade-away

I'm placeable
I have no place now
Untraceable
To your jaded vows
I'm placeable
No more of your face
I'm placeable
So help me please
