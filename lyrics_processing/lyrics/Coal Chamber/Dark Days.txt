So subtle the noose (the noose, the noose, the noose, the noose)
So subtle the noose
There is no light, hat's what they say
I'm checkin' out, not checkin' in
Drawing lines - Growing out of favor, out of favor
Out of favor!
Out of favor!
Out of favor!
Out of favor!
Out of favor!
Out of favor!
Out of favor!
Out of favor!
If it's meant to be, then set it free
If it's meant to be, it'll come back, you see
If it's meant to be, then set it free
If it's meant to be, it'll come back, you see
Watch what you say, and what I don't
Heard what you've asked, and no, I won't
Drawing lines, growing out of favor, out of favor
If it's meant to be, then set it free
If it's meant to be, it'll come back, you see
If it's meant to be, then set it free
If it's meant to be, it'll come back, you see
