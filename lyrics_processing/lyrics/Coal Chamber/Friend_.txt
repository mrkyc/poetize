Living a lie, let's not pretend
That you like me, or we are friends
We can call it for the few that are listening
Tonight we'll divide the dream
Cut the loss - Feel no pain
You can fuck the fame
You can fuck the fame
For the ones that are listening

All this time that I called you friend
I won't be there for you again
All this time that I called you friend
I won't be there for you again
All this time that I called you friend
I won't be there for you again
All this time that I called you friend
I won't be there for you again

Your future's bleak - You better save your skin
It's that flesh you smell - It's that skin you're in
Your soul is rotting, as well as your inners
Your mind and teeth, they're getting thinner
Selfish, self-sustaining
Regrets, unmistaking
Fuck the fame
You can fuck the fame
For the ones that are listening
