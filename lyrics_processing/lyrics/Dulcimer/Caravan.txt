Frankton Lane was still Frankton Lane
Time had changed not one branch
Elderberries were hanging where elderberries had always hung
Deadly Nightshade rode the wall she had always ridden
With her "Touch me if you dare"
Still beating from her heart-shaped leaves
And I stood as I had stood as a boy
And looked to see what I had seen as a boy
The passing caravan
And as its wheels slowly turned
The ribbon of road on which I stood
Became a fairground of sounds, gypsy sounds
Mingling jingling gypsy sounds
Wandering roads that have no bounds
Wrinkled walnut crystal gazing lady
Reins of leather brush the ground
Shining brasses, fortunes found
Do you know my future, lady? Maybe
Spoken:
And as the pilgrims of a dying race
Cast their smiles upon my face
I followed swaying curtain lace
From country road to fireplace
Where flames began their midnight chase
You might also likeLight your fires to the sky
Sparks may leap but ashes lie
The hearth was warm but stones grow cold
The road still calls but you grow old
Light your fires anyway
Certainties for yesterday
Light your fires
Dance and sing tonight
Mingling jingling gypsy sounds
Wandering roads that have no bounds
Wrinkled walnut crystal gazing lady
Can you see my future pass?
Clouded crystal made of glass
Why are you so sadly gazing, lady?
Maybe, maybe
Spoken:
As the Indians of England
Settle in their oak tree reservations
The old lady sets aside her age
As the caravan sets aside its road
While mandolins hang their spindly notes
Upon every branch and leafy tassel
High upon roof within caravan castle
Down to a boat, afloat on a stream
Into the water that washes them clean
Then high in the trees so as not to be seen
And the tale unfolds where the gypsies have been
I've travelled many roads
And I've wandered many a trail
I've seen the light of Tolser
With soldiers clad in mail
I've even seen a crow fly
Taking bread down to a jail
The sky withdrew its mantle
For the moon to take as sail
And I've seen a sky of blue
Where the sun once shone so warm
I've seen that sky then turn to black
And I've seen the planets form
I've held a glove of water
That I stole from above
I gave it to my lady
And she gave me her love
And I've heard the cannons roar
And I've seen a castle fall
I've seen an arrow pierce the skull
Of one who hit the floor
I've seen a young girl on the street
Who turned into a whore
I was the one who took her
I am the eagle's claw
Spoken:
And I turned as I had turned as a boy
To leave as a passing caravan
Mingling jingling gypsy sounds
Wandering roads that have no bounds
Wrinkled walnut crystal gazing lady
