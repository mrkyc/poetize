Sleepy Gilreath is probably the best dressed man in Trouble. In fact, there ain't no probablys, he is. Sleepy's our undertaker. He's a quiet little man, he don't bother any of us. Every day at 12 noon, you could set your watch by it, that's if you got one, Sleepy takes a walk down the main street of Trouble. He says "Howdy," he never smiles, that is unless he sees one of the old folks looking kinda pale. Now, every day when Sleepy takes his walk, he'll take a few steps and turn and look over his right shoulder. Now, he does this so he can keep an eye on his assistant, a full-blooded Indian named Charlie Flood. And Sleepy makes Charlie take a walk with him every day, 'cause if he didn't, Charlie would sneak back and drink up all the embalming fluid. And Charlie Flood's drinking is 'bout the only worry that Sleepy Gilreath has, 'cause he knows we'll all be giving him a little business sooner or later

Cowards and heroes, listen my, friends
If you have money or nothing to spend
It'll make no difference in a hundred years or so

Sooner or later, we all make the little flowers grow
Sooner or later, we all make the little flowers grow

Wise men and fools, two'll get you five
You'll never get out of this world alive
Don't run and hide, it's no use, I know

Sooner or later, we all make the little flowers grow
Sooner or later, we all make the little flowers grow

Short men and tall men and all the rest
Please don't blame me, I didn't start this mess
Some of us stay and some of us go
You might also like
Sooner or later, we all make the little flowers grow
