Today was gonna be the day
He'd already wrote the note
And parked that Chevrolet
At the end of that dead end road
Had his finger on the trigger
Just about to end everything
He was taking one last long breathe
When he heard his cell phone ring

And his best friend said man where you been?
We're headed down to the lake this weekend
You better not miss it 'cause buddy I swear
It won't be the same If you ain't there
And I told that girl that you like so much
You were coming along and her eyes lit up
I better let you go, man
I really hope I didn't catch you in the middle of anything
He said you kinda did but I don't mind at all
I'm glad you called

In another town down the road
In the backseat of a car
Two 18-year-olds had let a kiss go top far
He said how are we gonna have this child
When were both headed off to school?
He convinced her late one night there's only one thing to do
She was scared to death in that waiting room
When the nurse asked how far along are you
She said five weeks and just about then
Her phone lit up and his call came in
You might also like
Saying baby I was wrong about everything
I've already bought you a diamond ring
We're gonna start a life, would you be my wife?
Boy or girl; pink or blue; yeah either way
All she could say as she felt those teardrops fall
I'm so glad you called

If someone you know is weighing on your mind
And needs a friend on the end of that other line
Don't hesitate what you say may seem so small
But who knows? They might be glad you called
