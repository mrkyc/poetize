I know it's been a couple of years
But more and more you've been on my mind
I know it hurt when I took off
And I don't know which way your life has gone
But if you're free it's a beautiful day to ride
My bikes got a tank full of gas
And room for you on the back
We don't even have to talk about us
I just wanna listen to the sound of
The wind rushing and the engine humming
A song that will set us free
We don't have to think about forever
Just spend a little time together
All I'm asking you to do is ride with me
Ride with me
We'll find us a little town
Where the speed of life slows down
Grab a couple of beers and roll back the clock
God, I sure miss that smile
Enough to drive five hundred miles and back
What a little vacation time I've got
You might also likeSo come on, baby, let's hit the road
It's up to you how far we go
We don't even have to talk about us
I just wanna listen to the sound of
The wind rushing and the engine humming
A song that will set us free
We don't have to think about forever
Just spend a little time together
All I'm asking you to do is ride with me
We'll take the twist and turns
Where the black top river bends
Sail right through the curves
To whatever's at the end
We don't even have to talk about us
I just wanna listen to the sound of
The wind rushing and the engine humming
A song that will set us free
We don't have to think about forever
Just spend a little time together
All I'm asking you to do is ride with me
Ride with me
Yeah, ride with me
