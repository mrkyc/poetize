When the weight of this world is just too much
God knows she'll be waiting with open arms
She'll take me in once again, get me on my feet
And then I'll walk away with her heart
If I was any kind of man I'd let that woman go
Move it on down the road and I wouldn't look back
Put the pedal to the metal in this Pontiac
If I had any kind of strength she wouldn't have to be strong
Think she needs me, she just needs me gone
Only one of us don't know
If I was any kind of man I'd let that woman go
Maybe I'm afraid to be alone
Or just scared as hell to think of her moving on
It'd kill me to see her with another man
I should've done the right thing, put a ring on her left hand
God knows she gave me every chance
If I was any kind of man I'd let that woman go
Move it on down the road and I wouldn't look back
Put the pedal to the metal in this Pontiac
If I had any kind of strength she wouldn't have to be strong
Think she needs me, she just needs me gone

If I was any kind of man I'd let that woman go
She'll lose her little sleep waiting on me tonight night
But tomorrow will be the first day of the rest of her life
I hope she understands why I couldn't say goodbye
If I was any kind of man I'd let that woman go
Move it on down the road and I wouldn't look back
Drop the hammer down in this old Pontiac
If I had any kind of strength she wouldn't have to be strong
She thinks she needs me, she just needs me gone
God, I wish, I didn't know
If I was any kind of man I'd let that woman go
