Whose bed have your boots been under?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
But whose bed have your boots been under?

Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

I heard you've been sneaking
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walking
With long-legs Louise
And you weren't just talking
Last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

Come on, boots
Oh yeah (Come on)
So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

I wanna know whose bed, baby
Whoa baby
Tell me
Whose bed
Yes, I wanna know
You better start talking
