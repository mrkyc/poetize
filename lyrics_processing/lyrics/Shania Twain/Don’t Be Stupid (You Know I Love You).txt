Cool
Yeah
Uh-uh, yeah

You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys, you think they're on my tail
I get so aggravated
When I get off the phone and get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me?
And you'll see

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax, Max

Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible
No, no, no
