When you forget where you belong
I put on my favorite song to remind you
You're my best friend, that's who you are
You're my best friend, that's who you are
Just remember who you got
When you feel a little lost, I'll find you
I'll remind you that's who you are
You're my best friend, that's who you are

No matter what, yeah, I got you
And I know that you got me, you got me too

(Yeah, you) When I trip, you pick me up
(Yeah, you) When you know I've had too much
(Yeah, you) You're the one to call my mom
You always take the blame and you know I'd do the same
(Yeah, you) Each time I go too far
(Yeah, you) Hide the keys to my car
(Yeah, you) And like the friend you are
You always take the blame and you know I'd do the same for you

We've both made the same mistakes
Wakin' up in the wrong places wasted
Naked, that's who we are
Yeah, we're best friends, that's who we are
Remember we've still got the shirts
That we probably should've burned in Vegas (Let's go out to Vegas)
I bet they hate us at that casino bar
But it made us who we are

No matter what, yeah, I got you
And I know that you got me
All the years and the tears that we've been through
Still, I know that you got me, I got you, too

(Yeah, you) When I trip, you pick me up
(Yeah, you) When you know I've had too much
(Yeah, you) And like the friend you are
