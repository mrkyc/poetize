I wasn't just broken, I was shattered
I trusted you so much, you're all that mattered
You no longer love me, and I sang like a sad bird
I couldn't move on, and I think you were flattered

Oh, life's about joy (Joy)
Life's about pain (Pain)
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved (Loved)
And love the way I should (Should)
Life's about, life's about to get good

Oh, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)

The longer my tears fell, the wider the river (Good to love you, baby)
It killed me that you'd give your life to be with her (Good to love you, baby)
I had to believe that things would get better (Better, better)
It was time to forget you, forever

It took me so long to be strong
But I'm alive, and I hold on
To what I can feel, it hurts to heal
Oh, when love lies
