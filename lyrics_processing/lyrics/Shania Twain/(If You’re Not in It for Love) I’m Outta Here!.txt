Mind if I sit down?
Can I buy you a round?
Haven't seen your face before
Are you new in town?
It's the same old line
Oh every time
Are you here alone?
Can I take you home?

Now every woman sees
With every "pretty please"
There's a pair of lying eyes
And a set of keys
He says, "come be a star" (Ooh)
In the back seat of my car
Oh, but baby, slow down
You're going way too far

Let me make it clear
To you, my dear, yeah

Let me make it clear
To you, my dear
