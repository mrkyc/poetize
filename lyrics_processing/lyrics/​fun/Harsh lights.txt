The barkeep's in a bad mood
Playing with his chains
Talking about a blood moon
Asking how I found this place
My eyes are drained
From the one that got away
So tonight I'm going out, tonight I'm gonna stay out
In walks lady long boots
Looking for a date
I would make the first move
But I'm too drunk to enunciate
They're moving on
Don't wanna hear about someone's day
So tonight I am going out, tonight I'm gonna stay out

And it's so hard just to breathe
There's such a fine line 'tween the things you want and the
And the things that you need
So I'm not going to sleep

Slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing gets me down
Running into old friends
I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show them
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
So
I'm slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing here is bringing me down
You might also like
My heart is always breaking
For the ghosts that haunt this room
We fall asleep to revolution
And wake up to another sad excuse
Oh, what a shame
How we got it our way
So tonight I'm going out, tonight I'm gonna stay out

And it's so hard not to scream
There is such a fine line 'tween the things you are and the
And the things that you've been

Slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing gets me down
Up above the past loves
I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show them
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
So
I'm slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing here is bringing me down
I'm scared that I'm becoming a satellite
On the sadder side of the moon
Convinced that anyone stood by my side
Now you're on the other side of the room
But I get this funny feeling
That tonight is gonna end
Much better than it's been
I thought I'd have to keep my eyes open
Until the light shines in

And it's so hard just to be
There's such a fine line
There's such a fine line
Such a fine line
But I'm not sleeping tonight

Slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing gets me down
Running into old friends
I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show them
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
So
I'm slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And Nothing here is bringing me down
Nothing here is bringing me down
