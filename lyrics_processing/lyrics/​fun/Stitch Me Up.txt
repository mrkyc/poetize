It's how we do it! Our feet in the sand
It's how we do it! Our heads in our hands
It's how we do it! I'm not looking for a reason to go
It's how we do it! We did it, we done it, but never before, oh, I know

You put the keys in the car and drive
I'm gonna make sure the money is right
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive

(It's how we do it!)
It's how we do it, if I lose you, I'm losing control
So snap your fingers, pull the trigger 'cause I figure we're better as ghosts
It's how we do it on a satellite, looking for a signal to space
It's how we do it, we did it, we done it, let's do it again

You put the keys in the car and drive
I'm gonna make sure the money is right
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive
I'll find somebody who will stitch me up
Though I've never been better then when falling apart
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive
You put the keys in the car and drive

For all that I know, it's gonna come back tenfold
For all that I know, it's gonna come back tenfold
But darling, oh no, I don't think that we'll make it out alive
Darling, oh no, we won't make it out alive

Now I'm lost with each passing day
So if you're coming then come quick 'cause I'm scared I'm floating away
It's how we do it! For the first time, I don't need a reason to go, yeah
It's how we do it! We did it, we done it, let's do it some more

You put the keys in the car and drive
I'm gonna make sure the money is right
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive
I'll find somebody who will stitch me up
Though I've never been better then when falling apart
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive
You put the keys in the car and drive
