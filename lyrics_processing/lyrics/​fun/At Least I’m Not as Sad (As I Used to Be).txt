Have you ever wondered about our old nu-metal friends and what became of them?

Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing on
(Come on, can you count all the notches in your belt?)
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself
(Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper)
I don't want no savior, baby, I just want to have a good time
(Oh-oh-ooh-whoa, oh-oh-ooh-whoa)
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be

And they said, "Hey Nate!"
(Yeah, it's been a while, are you gonna stay?) And I began to smile and I said
"You should've seen me a couple of years ago
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing on"
(Come on, can you count all the loves that didn't last?)
It's such a gas when you bring up the past
(Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper)
I don't want no savior baby, I just want to get it out

(Oh-oh-ooh-whoa, oh-oh-ooh-whoa)
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be
(Oh-oh-ooh-whoa, oh-oh-ooh-whoa)
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be
You might also like
Just get it out
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be
And they said, "We would've seen you too, years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show"
But you was taken over by rock and roll
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing

So I left, that is it
That's my life, nothing is sacred
I don't keep friends, I keep acquainted
I'm not a prophet, but I'm here to profit
That's all, I'm gone
That's my life, nothing is sacred
I don't fall in love, I just fake it
