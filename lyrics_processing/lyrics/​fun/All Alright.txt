And it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright

And I got the call soon as the day hit night
As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside
I stopped the car and came outside
'Cause I know that tone
I remember the first time we wished upon parallel lines
Waiting for a friend to call and say they're still alive

I've given everyone I know a good reason to go
I was surprised you stuck around long enough to figure out

That it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright

And now all my loves that come back to haunt me
My regrets and texts sent to taunt me
I never claimed to be more than a one-night stand
You might also like
I've given everyone I know a good reason to go
But I came back with the belief that everyone I love is gonna leave me

And it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright

And I know, oh no, you've fallen from the sun
Crashing through the clouds, I see you burning out
And I know, oh no, that I put up a front
But maybe, just this once, let me keep this one

Yeah, it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
Yeah, it's all alright, I guess it's all alright
