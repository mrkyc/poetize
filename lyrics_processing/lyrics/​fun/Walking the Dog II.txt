Walking alone 'cause the night is dead
Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge
How you lost your mind, your wrist got bruised
You wanted better love when it was sleeping in your bedroom
Hold on, stay on my side, don't go

I wish you could see me, whoever I am
It's not like the movies, it's not all skin and bones
So come on love, come on, come on, go
No, no, no, I will not let you go, I will not let you go

Now I'm walking alone 'cause the night is dead
My feet don't glide like they did back then
When I would call you up so we could shoot the moon
These days I'm left to howl in tune
Hearts do break, I must admit
I got a better set of chords, I might have been faking it
Think I really only cried just once

I wish you could see me, whoever I am
It's not like the movies, it's not all skin and bones
So come on love, come one, come on, go
No, no, no, I will not let you go

(After all the shows, after the boys of summer did go)
Amid all the confusion (These friends I've been losing)
I always thought from the start (I'd be the one moving on)
I guess I'll never know where all the boys of summer did go
(But I'll miss what we made) I know the days were not wasted
(There are some things that I may never know)
How you lost your mind and your wrists got bruised
You wanted better love, sleeping your bedroom
Hold on, stay on my side, don't go

I wish you could see me, whoever I am
It's not like the movies, it's not all skin and bones
So come on love, come one, come on, go
