The amount of pills I'm taking
Counteracts the booze I'm drinking
And this vanity I'm breaking
Lets me live my life like this
And well, I find it hard to stay
With the words you say
Oh baby, let me in
Oh baby, let me in
Well, I'll choose the life I've taken
Never mind the friends I'm making
And the beauty that I'm faking
Lets me live my life like this
And well, I find it hard to stay
With the words you say
Oh baby, let me in
Oh baby, let me in

And you can cry all you want to
I don't care how much you'll invest yourself in me
We're not working out
We're not working out

And you can't touch my brother
And you can't keep my friends
And we're not working out
We're not working out
This time, I mean it
Never mind the times I've seen it

Well, I hope I'm not mistaken
By the news I heard from waking
And it's hard to say I'm shaken
By the choices that I make
And well, I find it hard to stay
With the words you say
Oh baby, let me in
Oh baby, let me in
Well, I'll choose the life I've taken
Never mind the friends I'm making
And I get a little shaken
'Cause I live my life like this
And well, I find it hard to stay
With the words you say
Oh baby, let me in
Oh baby, let me in

And you can cry all you want to
I don't care how much you'll invest yourself in me
We're not working out
We're not working out

And you can't keep my brother
And you won't fuck my friends
And we're not working out
We're not working out
This time, I mean it
Never mind the times I've seen it
Never again
Never, well, never again
Never, never, never, never again
You can cry all you want to
I don't care how much you invest yourself in me
Never, never, never, never
You can cry all you want to
I don't care how much you invest yourself in me

Oh baby, let me in, oh baby, let me in
Oh baby, let me in, oh baby, let me in
Oh baby, let me in, oh baby, let me in
