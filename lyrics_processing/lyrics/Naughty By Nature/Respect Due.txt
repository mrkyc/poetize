We're on wax and it concerns ya that makes us eternal like a picture
Ya bitch ya, I'll fix ya, raise a rapture, rips ya scripture
I'll mack a meal, in fact until I stack the bills to rack the skills
To get a track to kill then rap at will
The I is capital, double-L, lower case t-o-w-n
No trouble, I'll bust your bubble then leave you for ruins
Such come a dime a dozen, fuck some
You lost the race by a dick, slut's cum 'cause nuts won
What fun freakin' it frequently, freak wit' me, slick to freak quick
Your girl's punani's packed like tha freaknic
We get redicu-down-diculous and devious, believe me, bitch
Now your fuckin' soul ain't so mischievous
Diss who?! We're the hip-hop rap pounder founders
Ricochetin' PM to AM, fryin' freestyle flounders
Big as bouncers, ounce to ounces
Don't make us check you; yes, you!
Just know respect due!

Check it out
I'm hearin' niggas in the game yappin' this, yappin' that
Talkin' Vinnie don't write, and Vinnie can't rap
But I bet if you put a pen and pad in my hand
I could write it in your face, my friend, put it on tape and then
Give it to my nigga Kay Gee, he produces me
Pump it through the Flavor Unit, spread it through the industry
The next three weeks, my single done peaked on the rap sheets
Sounds knockin' from malls to swapmeets
And then there's oh mad tours and oh mad whores
We sign autographs by the G's in the in-stores
And then there's oh mad sex and ASCAP checks
So when I, um, plex it, it's me, I'm in the Beamer or Lexus
Guess which nigga is next to flex this
Style that I be ripping's authentic, so don't test this

You can fool some of the people some of the time
But not all of my people all of the time
Some of 'em rhyme some of the time
'Cause some of 'em 9, some of 'em mine
And 'bout as Brown as Bobby, wit' a trolley to bury Halle
It's chocolate, so pardon Dolly as a hobby
When it comes to harm me, ya don't alarm me
'Cause I roll wit' Double I and Ron G's army
So that's 235 on a slang bang
And see Ron wit' a nigga for fuckin' A-Train
And that's deep like the Minds of Minolta
Deep just like the Swedishness on John Travolta
If you don't look good, we don't look good
Deez nuts that soon clear the room
So BOOM! To the break and break, ah, to the snap
And snap to the beat, I'll freak to bring it back
Plus I had no choice but to roll wit' the flow
