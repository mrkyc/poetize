I'm telling you, I want this done quick, in and out
I want all that black market shit, everything
Grab all the tapes, all the cassettes
Who is it?
Where the shit? Everybody on the floor, nobody move
Where the shit? (Yo, Treach)
Yoke the joker

(New style, new style)
(My name is Treach and I'm a triple-star MC)
There are too many overnight MCs, one
And too many who haven't paid they dues (My name is Treach and I'm a triple-star MC)
You have now entered the frost of the Flavor Unit
And we, Naughty By Nature, will get our just due
By terminating you
(My name is Treach and I'm a triple-star MC)
(New style, new style)
I can snap, rap, pack, click-clack, patter-pat-pat
Take that ass to the point you have to ask for your ass back
A fuckin' joker smoker, taunted by no one
If I was born in Chun Li's temple, I would've turned out a shogun
Smack the any-and-all talk, jokers I can't hawk
And all that shit I hear about me losin' is small talk
I ain't a punk or slouch and furthermore, I don't scare chief
The reason I called you pussy 'cause you are what you eat, each
Lick is a little closer to the center of a Blow Pop
Don't speak when I am talkin', this is my fuckin' show-op
How dare you even try me? Don't you know you'll be funky while
He's smilin' backstage doin' your mother, ugh, doggystyle?
I'm wild, raw, a whore and still suave
Check out the style that I've
Soul-simulated, sounds from a stocky
Semi-social, never seem sloppy
See, silly-slappin' suckers, sorry saps, and slouches
Straps slam in style, smackin', this man's a savage
Least see so-so-songs and some shots, so
Snatch seven samples, start slowly, go solo
Set the cassette stereo, sounds diffin'
Strip the Sagittarius and marriage is a system
Smoke the joker three times over
And owe her
Go with the flow or I'm about to yoke a joker

All that straight-faced shit like your heart had been through
Smile and give your face somethin' the fuck to do
You ugly, smugly, squiggly, dilly-wrinkled faced bastard
Someone needs to hit-and-run it and run your ass over backwards
Let's giddy up, yep, yep, another fuck up
Grab your microphone, battle time, sure 'nough (New style)
Any freestyle I see while I prowl
I dial a new style, tell me 'bout ooh, child (New style)
Another victory, it's mystery
I smoke your skull, your brain'll come blistery
All fuzzy, dirty, dizzy, does he
Get the fix he needs? Remember how blistery? (New style)
You ain't ready for the Freddy of rap
You can't kill me, I step into your dreams, you feel me
Slicing your life away, just like my mic today
I eat you the psycho way, I'm rippin' shit right away (Rippin' shit right away)
I treat you like a bitch in a ditch off of angel dust
Take you to a roof, sure you can fly, just jump, slut
You think you might say a rhyme, then someone might order like
You couldn't wet shit up in a motherfuckin' water fight
All lockjaw, look at the props, y'all
So proud of, sure, suck my encores
Swingin' a bolo, the flow go solo
I'ma smoke ya
It's time to yoke the joker

The only way you wouldn't be gettin' dissed, jumped like a girlie (New style)
Is if your father would've bothered to pull it out early (New style)
You ain't got a single drip drop, you're stripped of hip-hop (New style)
If I see ya disagree, you'll be gettin' your shit dropped (New style)
It's the extended version, the side you can't fuck with
You'll get the jimmy, MC, you're swift to kick the bucket
I'm tired of Mr. Nice Guy, place your price high
Bet on a battle rhymer, tell my chances are sky high (New style)
Never would you ever get the thrill to say, "Yo, sweat
You know that kid Treach, I took him out, he was no threat"
Because you know I'm better than that on my worst day
Dickin' competition's what I do in the worst way
Quick to do a hit for you, most likely, I spoiled you
Or brought you, ignored you, then broadly floored you
The proof is in the puddin', my collar ain't wooden
It takes more than an axe to tax, bless the children
Physically, facially, racially made to be
Crazily paid, a G, what a fuckin' way to be
Hot damn, I'm a man with a hand plan
Pimp smack that, then attract the new game plan
Eat your big beef, digest the rest, test
Shit, I was slept yet, then go to the next step
That's what I do, that's what I say, that's what I live (That's what I live)
That's what I prove, that's what I move, that's what I give (That's what I give)
Makin' other brothers wanna go home and write shit
Bite what I might get, then up and say, "I quit"
Me gettin' got? (New style), oh, what a beautiful thought from you
Ain't it amazing what some paper plus a pen and tongue can do? (New style)
Yoke the joker
