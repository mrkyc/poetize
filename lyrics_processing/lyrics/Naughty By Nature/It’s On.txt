Once again it's on...

Pu-put me on the planet, dammit
Where all the slamsters look like Janet
Slick consider this how I lick it and then fan it
Pick, rub and ran it, how I run it, yeah, I ran it
And it ran frantic rub put new poonanie panic
Plan it, as a package, pick it and then pack it
Trick it and attract it, throw a crack then catch it
Quick as Ricochet Rabbit, quick 'cause it's a habit
To rap it as fast as another brother runnin' rapid
Never call you Sir, who gives a damn if you Mix-a-lot?
East Coast gets the props, producers rock your knot
Baby ain't got back, baby got black
That's why you see the black baby and you respect that
Checka-check it out, on and on and on, rock on
To the breaka-breaka dawn, it's on!

"On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"
"On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"
It's on

Make room for one rude boy
Bad mood boy, new and old school, boy
Now, watch a true man take out all the schoolboys
And don't get out of touch 'cause you just get a slut
With a "Closed For Repair" sign on your nuts
Yeah, we're the thing slangers, body boom bangers
Breakin' in your shit with a hanger
Damn, real, I'm gonna live it up
Never forgive your cut on my back
Watchin' your girl's gap give it up
I touch you where it hurts first
Brutalize you with a verse, true to size, my lyrics work
Think about a lost block, black stop
I'd rather make a wack drop then slap you with my backdrop
The boom-bang slap papper's fat fat
Step in my path and get that ass cr-crack-cracked!
Checka-check it out, on and on and on
Rock on, to the breaka-breaka dawn, it's on!

"On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"
"On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"

Singin' like the buddha bang
Hang out with a true crew down with the coochie bang
Brothers come to do the same
But monkey see, monkey do
Get your monkey ass brained!
Individuals get original 'cause a this a be critical
And pickable and pitiful
I ain't with the big con heart
Rippin' other rhymes apart, here to spark me some iron parts
I stick to a city with some ripple, hit a bitty from the middle
Hang on kitties like a cripple nipple
Checka check it out, on and on and on
Rock on, to the breaka breaka dawn it's on

"On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"
"On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"
"On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"
"On and on and on, on and on and on
