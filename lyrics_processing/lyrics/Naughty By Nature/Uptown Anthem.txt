Hey, you could smoke a spliff with a cliff
But there's still no mountain high enough
Or wide enough to touch
The naughty, nappy, nasty nigga, the nasty, trashy, ho-happy pappy
That's happy to be nappy
Me and Vin Rock win spots, hit flocks
In groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I roll when my hairdo don't
When the will I got wantin' competition ain't dope
Beat ya, break ya, broke ya, smoke ya, take ya
Send you to your little group on mute sooner or later
He wanna flip, tell him full, semi, half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty, naughty, hi, bye, greater than nature, why I
Shin slam the flim-flam and then jam
You can run, but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are

We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

Here we go, yo
Hit a nigga, kill a nigga, we'll come back
See a sucker, stretch a sucker, guard your naps
Cussin' wasn't nothin' 'til a Black man rapped
See a forty, suck a forty, guess who's back
You might also like
You're chillin' with a titty-feelin' villian
Steppin' to the puny, puddy punks catchin' feelings
I hit so many guts, call me gutter, I'm the bread and butter
Punk motherfuckers, I'll cut up, workin' from the gut up
Brand new steady, heavy as a Chevy
Ready for the piddy-peddy, I'm Friddie Freddie
Place your bet on a vet, the three-man threat
What you see is what you get

We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

Comin' round the corner with my Uptown bunch
I bet your bottom dollar that you're bottom-bunk chumps
Give it up, it's a juice thing, I'm steppin' for the rep and
Wreckin' all the rest and weapon testin' on who's steppin'
Ain't no bluff for the niggy-nuff, for the rugged rough stuff
Nigga, if you're tough, knuckle up
I'll cut your ass like class, then blast you by the trash
After I laugh, then I'll dash
You can't handle the scandal of an uptown vandal
Shootin' up your toes, makin' sandals
Somebody told me that you own me, but can't nobody hold me
I do my dirt all by my lonely
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

We gonna
We gonna
We gonna
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna, we gonna
