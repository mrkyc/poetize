Ayo, Vin, come take this ride to Sandwiches with me
I'ma let you check out this new tape I just did (Alright)
Yo, I'm rollin' with y'all, man
Alright
Put that tape in
Check this out, Vin
How long you been workin' on it?
Last night, check this out
Yo, that's soundin' kinda def
Damn, kid, here come the cops again, man (Word?)
God, you better pull over, man
Alright, alright, I'ma pull over
Fuck they want? (Hide that forty)
Yo, yo, Vin
Put the Benzi Box under the seat
Cool out, cool out, cool out
Yo, you got a problem, cop?
You got a problem with blastin' that damn music?
My fault, man
My fault, my ass, if I catch you playin' that shit again, I'ma give you a fuckin' noise pollution ticket
Yeah, aight, whatever
Yeah, aight, now get your punk ass outta here
Kill me, man (Tough guy)
Nah, let's why niggas played theyself, man
Yo, Kay, man, crank that shit
Yeah, hand me that radio, Vin
Word

(Strike a nerve)
Yo, Treach, it was some bitch in a seminar talkin' about you had to get up early to wax
(Strike a nerve)
Some other motherfucker said you couldn't even wax that dirty bitch
So what's up, yo?
(Strike a nerve)

I get my daily dose of cha-cha-cha and, "Shut the fuck up, ho"
Shit, shaved, and bathed everyday, then I must go
Ugh, this is every day, all day, let's all say
Pluckin' enough and roughin' 'em up and fuckin' 'em up always
Bet, let's talk about a back-flash, you jackass
That fast, you bash with a mash of fast rap
And even though you didn't know me before
The flow solo is no slow way to go, bolos I throw are so
Let's pick a bitch to pick with, peekaboo
I see you through your crew, now what you wanna do?
After that, caps off to the black frost
My pants always sag 'cause I rap my ass off (Woo)
You wanna talk about a bad boy, sad choice
I'm bad as they come, chum, and nasty like Jas Joyce
I'm too rough to be touched, I'm buckwild
I hit your bing-bing, bing, straight up ricochet rap style
To Vin Rock and Kay Gee, I'm the baby
Drivin' the ladies crazy and maybe have the right to be lazy
Got more stretch in my swing than the stretch of a chicken wing
The flavor is bathin' and its craving is ice cream
I'm too trucked to be fucked and too live otherwise
Your drive-by's small for, word to the mother my brother eyed
Runnin' and comin', drummin', starin' with a stale look
I'll leave so many lumps, they'll use your head as a braille book
Many friendships end quick fast
It'll take a dollar worth of gas to outlast your little tired ass
You tried to swing this way, you little swifty
(Ha-ha-ha, slum bitches still miss me, chill)
I do the dumpin', humpin', clappin' like thunder
And that's comin' from a land down under
Yo, I'm sick of this shit, man
Niggas tryin' to cut V-Rock's nuts (Strike a nerve)
Yo, they tryin' to make us drop V-Rock
Sayin' he don't rock enough
Yo, kick that shit

Prepare for the worst, 'cause I ain't livin' loss
I wouldn't just give a fuck, 'cause givin' is free and my fucks cost (Word)
I'll never get lost in The Source, 'cause I know my way
I been there before, maybe five, six times a day
Sometimes I put my hands on my head when I'm done crumb
And wonder to myself where did that daft shit come from?
And then I think about the Naughty and the Nature in it
And then the flavor, then the figures while I'm flowin' with it
So I won't give up, stop, stall, quit, you kiddin'?
You can't touch this, fuck what it's wrote, written
I got tracks better known as snaps, far forbidden
In the womb, do I know, I know how to make you feel 'em
I'll take a head, I'll make you spread, and I'll lay back
I tell you once, I tell you twice, Vinnie don't play that (You don't?)
So don't start nothin', won't be nothin' is the lesson, folks
I hate cigarettes, but my Smith & Wesson smokes
From anywhere, from any corner, anytime that's right
Who you bashin'? I go blast in broad daylight
You stand hard, you look hard, yeah, your figure's soft
I got 'nough props from buckshots that niggas caught
You say you came close to the takin' me out, close, huh?
In that case, you shoulda named your album Almost
I wouldn't rely on the try if I was you, yo
'Cause I'm turnin' tries into uh-ohs and hell nos
I wouldn't be caught dead with you after tryin' this
And if I was goin', I'd get my stiff ass up and rip shit
I can't go out like a wooden sock with padlocks
I'll leave tacks tiny and slimy like snot spots
I'll write all day to me, it's a common caper
Say so much shit, I ought to write my rhymes on toilet paper
Yeah, V-Rock, backbone of Naughty By Nature, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Strike a nerve)
That's right, so everybody sleepin' on me, yo, stay off of my dick
(Strike a nerve)
We gon' stomp this time around
(Strike a nerve)
But yo, I'ma hold the joker by his neck
And we gon' stomp straight through the '90s (Hit that shit)

Look whose mother's in the studio, thirty sons and daughters
Mrs. Seven Figures in the back pitchin' quarters
Come and try to run with it, never in a lifetime
Thirty M's could add to Caesar's, still I bet I'll get mines
I heard your girl's havin' a baby, now will what she have?
A bag of dope, a bottle of crack, or a sess bag?
There ain't no part of me with sorry written on it, slick
You couldn't rock a crooked cradle, you fuckin' prick
The way I rock hood shit, you just awful like it
My style so fat, I had to throw it on a water diet
Bullshit you not, I ain't the type to be fuckin' with
Wreckin' with, and if my mic had tits, then I'll be neckin' it
Onslaught at an encore, you stinkin' rat
You so dumb, you tried to buy a fuckin' thinkin' cap
Now that tells us in a sec right where your head is at
In between some bitch's legs lickin' ass to lap
My name is Treach, remember this and don't you ever 'fess
That's a shame, I get two minutes just to say, "Next"
Fuck who follows you, you and them could help each other
I treat you both like any other motherfuckin' runner
This is the flavor, tasty, although sugar-free
So have a Coke, have a smile, and have a booger, G

(Why?) 'Cause you don't mean shit to me
I'm takin', put you where good shit's meant to be
I rock a rhyme that'll be a straight up def track
Droppin' more shit than White Castles and Ex-Lax
A studio to me is just a chance to rock, G
I rock and rock, hot damn, call me VinRocky (Haha)
That's just what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
I say one thing and your whole crew's walkin' out
So due to lyric theater, this is one lyric less
If I were you, I'd take him, throw him on his fuckin' neck
Something in flow should come straight from the horse's mouth
Mr. Ed's dead, so his ass is the best way out
Shit man for hire, this hitman is the law
I run more tracks than a San Francisco trolley car
Prepare for the winter, oh yeah
I could write your fuckin' album and you'll still be the last one there
I start to heat up and rip shit and won't cheat
You couldn't get it hard if the eyes was on Broad Street
So don't you ever never tell me I'm not good enough
I got more stuff than a teddy bear from ass to gut
This is a solid you could never outlast
If bullshit was worth a dime, you'd have a job in a cow's ass (Word)

Settin' the record straight for the '90s
No more talkin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, it's time to stop feelin' sorry for y'all little suckers, we takin' all y'all out
Word up, even if it's a line, you know what I'm sayin'?
Knuckle up, put 'em up, nothin'
Mind your business
You know what I'm sayin'?
Word up
Naughty By Nature, Naughty's there for a reason
Peace
