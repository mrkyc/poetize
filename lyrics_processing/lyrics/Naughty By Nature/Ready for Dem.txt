Ready for dem, but dem no ready for me, blam
Ready for dem, but dem no ready for me, blam, blam
Ready for dem but dem no ready for me
Bring nummy-num one, bring nummy-num two, bring nummy-nummy-num three

Here comes the man you dig, the man you dug
The man you love, the man you hug
So come get some of the funky drum-drum, here I come-come
Lights, camera, plenty punany action
I'm the Don in the city known for the nitty-gritty
Consider me Big Willy, consider you itty-bitty
I'm the youngest in a family of six
I flirted with chicks, and then I learned tricks in the ghetto mix
I went pop, but I still kept my ghetto pass
And anyone who laughs can kiss my yellow ass
I'm the okey-dokey man, the hokey-pokey man
The bigger nigga with the trigger leave you smoky, man
Quick to flip a chick or flatten a flappy lip
The kid never slips because I'm wicked off the hip
Known to keep it steady for punks who act petty
It's Vin Rock, Kay Gee, Treach, big and Heavy, you ain't ready

Ready for dem, but dem no ready for we, blam
Ready for dem, but dem no ready for we, blam, blam
Ready for dem but dem no ready for we
Bring nummy-num one, bring nummy-num two, bring nummy-nummy-num three

Sit tight or try to get wreck, ooh, when we ain't 'round yet
That's the type of writer to get booed at a sound check
Check the rep of the nappy Naughty Treach is
I go all out, fuck it, just call me exit
I'm on some old next shit, nexus, your neck for breakfast
Your back's for practice, an ass for ass kicks
And as for that shit, I'm sayin' this (brass brick?)
Get with this or this, ain't that shit that slick?
For what it's worth, I'm coming from the edge of the Earth
I'm the only kid I know that was worse at birth (Another ghetto bastard)
Everybody that knew me was worse than cursed
My first words, "Not me, spank the fucking nurse"
If I was a doctor, chill
I'll give you six months to live, another six if you can't pay the bill
I do what I will
I'll gas ya ass like Getty, 'cause motherfucker, you ain't ready

Ready for dem, but dem no ready for we, blam
Ready for dem, but dem no ready for we, blam, blam
Ready for dem but dem no ready for we
Bring nummy-num one, bring nummy-num two, bring nummy-nummy-num three

Flex like I'm in gymnastics or a prophylactic
Never short on loot 'cause I got a fat grip
I've been in the game for six joints and never lost cool points
I'm hard as cement and slick like ointment
For those of you who don't know the big, big man
You better slow down you diggity-dig-dig, man?
Consider me an overweight Don Juan, smooth as Perignon
I got it going on and on and on
Who be the next to get got? Drip-drop (prom like my buyer?)
The wrong man to marry but I'ma carry Mariah
You coming to flow flip? You better not blow it
He's king with nothing but an ashy toe to show for it
Let's get to flow, set the flow, bet' let me go
Might go, let me know, 'cause, uh , I'm read' to go
I come to tear you out the frame like I was rippin mona lisa
Your album budget is cheaper than your beeper So see ya

Some unlucky hockey-pucky
Brass monkey-drinking, I wonder what he's thinking
I got crazy rap trophies and you and you niggas know me
Respect you need to show me, if not, then blow me
The over-dominant one, you're just my youngest son
Before I blow, I'd like to say "yo" to all the young guns
Don't ever step or flex to set, you better double-figure
Ain't nothing roly-poly, homie, rolling with Naughty niggas

So neither you or yours, him or hers can do what?
I carved up ya hard bunch, so call it a crew cut
You ain't ready, remarkable, or regal
You're the fucking reason that abortion shit is legal
I'm eager as a beaver, yo, bite my shit and bring it back like a retriever
Off the nuts, mutts, I see ya
I ain't got time to be, trying to be find to be
Try, never find a G, if I find, it's mine, you see
They wanna come up, oh, why, how?
I say, "Oh, try now, step and I'll punch off your eyebrows"
I'm representing Jersey, Lord, have mercy
Naughty and Heavy, you'll never be ready, baby (Uh-huh)
