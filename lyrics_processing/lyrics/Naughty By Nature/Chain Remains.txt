Right about now, I think it's 'bout time that you explained to everybody the real reason you wear this chain around your neck, aight!
Yo, yo this Mook Daddy Number 1-6-double 0-3-0-5-0 representin' down in Fort Dix federal prison, you know what I'm sayin?
Representin' Double I for life 1-18

Too many of my people got time, it shows as crime unfolds
Many snap in a trap now new minds explode
Learn the ability to find their goals
Locked in a facility where time is froze
God knows the heart hurts to see no sky, just dirt
They give a man a cell quick before they give a man work
So we get into this black, this black cat syndrome
Grow older like there's no heart and no soul ingrown
Bars and cement instead of help for our people
Jails ain't nothin' but the slave day sequel
Tryin' to flee the trap of this nation
Seein' penitentiary's the plan to plant the new plantation
They say we'll take the animals from cottons and crops
Straight to forgotten wit locks plottin' to rottin' our stocks
They draw a crooked line and wait for your foot to fall under
Serving most of my brothers another football number
Judges look at our CDs, brothers like enemies
Saying "We don't need G's", giving out years like free cheese
Free please, nigga, ain't no freedom
Who's locked up? Who's shot up? Who's strung out? Who's bleeding?

I'm here to explain the chain remain the same
Maintain for the brothers and sisters locked

Prisoner 15430-050 representin' Jersey. All y'all niggas better back the fuck up, let's get busy
Yo this is Big J comin straight outta Compton. I'm locked up Fort Dix, New Jersey, Number 0-7-3-9-3-0-6-7. I'll be checkin' y'all out in 1997, playa

Nowadays still we're captured, still hear wicked laughter while shackled
We're beaten and battered then cuffed after we're tackled
We're tugged while increasing the mugged and indecent
Hit one more time wit a black jack then dragged in the precinct
Still don't know what the back and forth, looking meaner
Meant stripped, made into a convict, booked then fingerprinted
How many more times of this humiliation?
How many more bouts do we have to lose while we fight for our rights in this nation?
That we supposed to have since birth
But the breaks and the bricks get worse, so it's jail first
And that's all they offer us
Ain't that right Mr. Officer?

This is Leron 15-431-0-5-0 up in Tennessee outta Fort Dix representin' Cleveland and Illtown

Some rob blocks, does it matter or should it?
While ghettos dodge, cops duck bullets and pull it
I "Hang Out and Hustle wit my friends" 'til the end, 'til the day we burn pens
Ain't no mystery we need victory, the system conspired
The days of the riots ain't retired
But brothers staying calm 'cause they soldiers
So when the only solution's revolution, know we told ya
The chain remains 'til we uprise
Stuck in a land where we ain't meant to survive
And I hope this don't suit ya, some work
Like a slave to get a hit, but won't work to save for a future
And that's when the cost is the man within
And we're just as lost as the land we in
Some blast, and some base, and some dropped down
And most who sold it right now are lock down and rocked round
And it's been happenin' so much
That they make it so that it ain't even no shock now
