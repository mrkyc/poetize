"Hey!"
"Can't nobody hold me"

So niggas wan' take it there, huh?
Heh
See y'all don't know what the fuck goin' on
I know what time it is though

It's time to erase a face in force in fact an inferno (Hey)
Rise in my eyes, these twin 9s 'll make 'em learn though
You poppin, plottin, plannin, half-steppin', threatenin' (Hey)
The streets clap loud like like thunderclouds with the weapon
I'm steppin', to clarify, lookin' with the hawk
In the arrow eye, turn the biggest part of your ass
Into the narrow side, I'm that case you place, nigga
Tie yo' bitch to the shitter, nigga, throw yo' stinkin' ass
By the liver nigga, need beef, I rag fags
Scream peace, get dragged dad
Gettin' busy like Rasheed Street in Baghdad
Havin' your kids askin' "Why did they have to drag dad?"
Past 'cause you'll be the last ass to blast fast
Way above the rim, word to Birdie
I'm from Jersey leavin' niggas actin nerdy
Back sturdy, my dirt, by my lonely, fuck with this
Doin' hits, I'm more clutch, than a stick, so come on
You might also like
I do my dirt all by my lonely
"Hey!"
Find the phony
Pass the mask, one deep, yeah the only
Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin', patrollin' in a stolen black Cougar
I do my dirt all by my lonely
"Hey!", "Hey!"
"Can't nobody hold me, I do my dirt all by lonely"
Do or die, with slugs (Hey) for the Ruger (Can't nobody hold me)
Rollin', patrollin' in (I do my dirt all by my lonely) a stolen black Cougar

See I'm a one man dynasty; motherfucker
Every artist on your label don't equal half of me (Hey)
Rippin' lyrics like they supposed to be
Most'll be plottin' dreamin' and schemin' to get close to me
'Cause I spit shit, rip shit quick, and I'm sick with
Lyrics to mash that ass is what I'm equipped with (Hey)
So fine-tune that bullshit, bring your best competitor
I'll be on that ass as if I was a fuckin' predator (Hey)
Niggas wanna battle at a show, yeah I'll set it up
I go toe-to-toe, blow-for-blow and leave it wetted up
My time to hypnotize you, ok
Never disrespectin' the laws of nature, obey yo' thirst
Vin Rock'll serve as the quenchin'
Here's the last thing I'd like to mention
That when it's time to set it off, trust me son
I ain't the motherfuckin click, I'm the motherfuckin one
I do my dirt all by my lonely

I roll with hundreds, sometime thousands, maybe a little more (Hey)
But don't need nar' a motherfucker when it's time for the war
Some of these niggas on the streets be actin' so sweet
Talkin' 'bout stalkin' black like it ain't gon' get back to me (What?)
What about them MCs after me (Hey) (hahahaha)
Come see the first rappers laid flat on Banned From TV
Part 3 in 3-D, shot right in Jersey
On the corner with the goners lookin' straight up at me (whoo!) (Hey)
So fuck prolongin', I'm way past the strongarmin'
Played himself tonight, so he'll be gone by the morning
Sneak up, creep up, you out of pocket, the rule's no second chance
Lift a bitch out his shoes, watch the news

I do my dirt all by my lonely
"Hey!"
Find the phony
Pass the mask, one deep, yeah the only
Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin', patrollin' in a stolen black Cougar
I do my dirt all by my lonely
"Hey!"
"Can't nobody hold me, I do my dirt all by lonely"
Do or die, with slugs (Hey) for the Ruger
Rollin', patrollin' in a stolen black Cougar
I do my dirt all by my lonely
"Hey!"
Find the phony
Pass the mask, one deep, yeah the only
Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin', patrollin' in a stolen black Cougar
I do my dirt all by my lonely
"Hey!"
"Can't nobody hold me, I do my dirt all by lonely"
Do or die, with slugs (Hey) for the Ruger
