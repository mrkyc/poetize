You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin', dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written in kitten, hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve, embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd, man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy
And alleys are full of Phillies and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy, really!
So here we go, now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me... flow
Never mixin' with trickin' brothers
Bitchin' over vixens that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin', splittin' things that's bitten and gettin' written off
You're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off!
Before you even started, so what? So long, see you, fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it?
Try boom-bye-bye, bye-bye!

Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
You might also like
The flow pro poetical with skills only a vet'll know
Better know where's the wetter flow that's on point like decimals
Manhandlin' new crews
Partyin' with the Zoo Crew
Lookin' for the pink in boo boo's, I thought you knew too
Stone style's of stamina
Jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust, plus we're the party amateur damagers
Managin', damagin' mics, men and even mannequins
You're a fan again
Now I wanna know, who's the man again?
Naughty's back like vertebraes
Word to hey-a-ho, the way I show, you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time to slang
Bang and watch all the poo-tang tangs hang

Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
Then beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully, chase bass-lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party?
It's 'nuff poo-tang tang for everybody!
So hip up and split up, get up, get up your with up
Souped up, put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not, zip up your lip up
Whip up hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones
We came back 'cause we heard hip-hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Repin' these since the '70s, find me
So we went crazy in the '80s
So we won't kiss heinies in the '90s
Oops, the Naughty's, troops in sections with forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty, I'm Naughty
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
