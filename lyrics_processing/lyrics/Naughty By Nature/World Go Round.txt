Check it out
I heard this track right here and I kinda felt a lil' somethin'
You know, it took my mind some place it ain't been
Search deep into another world
So I'm tryin' to figure out what make this world go 'round, for real
People are stressed

Oh how, oh how come every time we have problems, they mix stunts?
Sendin' people to other planets when they still ain't fixed this one
Victims from a distance, predictions of affliction
Some factions cause frictions, so fractions need fixin'
Mixin', makin' music, man, to make it work
Some stickin', shakin', bruisin', damn, just ta brake a purse
It's worse, misguided, some guttered
Locked on the block 'cause the cops can't be trusted
Busted, flustered, frustrated, frustrations of no more patience
Insides are cold and vacant, check how we lay it
Why when we speak, they try to stifle our breath?
Cock a rifle to chest, then ya have the party of ya life at ya death
Ohhhh, I wanna know, I wanna know
Oh why, oh why is it always the good that have to go?
And they tell us that's just how this life goes
So I look at the kids, and wonder where their life might go
Get high to tell ya low that's how its done on the bricks
We all mad at the world when the world ain't done shit
Just the people in it and the scavengers who function
Who destroy the earth then blame the earth for its malfunctions
And that's gettin' maybe a tad bit too deep to follow
But the black form is strong, and far from bein' hollow
Why do we get so much into this freein' Willy
When Willy is Free
He and them ain't doin' shit to free my city
And it's a pity for those who can't get the nitty gritty
That's when the gritty gets grimy, and the wicked gets witty
So much pain on the brain, can't restrain
Place the comma, too much drama
But I'll bleed to please my momma
So I'ma strive to perfection, leave pride in slum sections
Keep wit' my crew and make all due corrections

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The ups and downs, a carousel

Oh, how the ways?
Nowadays, baby's comin' from spittin' out momma's nipple
From the cradle to the killa, leavin' corpse and cripples
A Brooklyn boy dies, shot by a cop for a play gun
Our kids' days are up, even if they ain't stray ones
You lay one, or two, or the more now the merrier
The day's done when crews war, and now streets get scarier
Cops hit blocks, sayin' we'll beat 'em into freedom
Then we feel robbed like there's no God when we need Him
So we act accordingly 'cause we don't see enjoyment
The only line of business I'm offered is unemployment
So we gots to get ours and I's got to get it
And it is what it be, so see that I'm with this
Media has us believin' the hype
Don't pull out ya new shoes
'Cause only the bad news is good news
Farrakhan wants us to take the streets back, time to take it
Before our whole race is stripped naked
