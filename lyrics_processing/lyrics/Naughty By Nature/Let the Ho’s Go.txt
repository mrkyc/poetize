Bass me, face me, taste the tip of a tasty
Beaches are sweet as a pastry
You don't know me, homie, from a peach and a pony
I'm the only, now your lyrics look lonely
Lyrically fortified, born, I'm immortalized
Lightin' shit up from Wranglers to raw hides
Packed with Black positivity and wizardry
I'm my own body and it built for partyin'
I rip hearts apart as if it's my last rap
The Lord's abroad and I'm respected as that
Sole seniority, face the foundation
Bolos and doughnuts how I built the nation
Keep the faith taste and keep your touch clutched
And keep your face way away from the rough stuff
If it ain't rough, it ain't rugged
Either you're a bum with none or you're stacked and star-studded
From the intro to end, I will flow
And also, yo, come let the hoes go

Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho (Let the hoes go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho

Meet my friend MAC-10, sittin' backpacked and mackin'
Thirsty for action, workin' and smackin'
The last of the allies, smoke 'em up, shall I?
Or should I? I'm sure to give it a good try
No need for a survival kit, there's nothin' left to fix
They've all been blown into dust bits
Floatin' in space, spinnin' in infinity
Part of the star dust, the end of any identity
Lost in the sauce, no cause, I'm the boss, gettin' off
East or West and South, break North
You're about as much use as a guard dog in a graveyard
Actin' is for actors, so you rap, but don't you play hard
I got the knack to wax and I ain't tryin' to fall back
I rap like I'm the top, stay real 'cause I'm all that
It's my way or the highway, forget your friends
'Cause I'll stick that ass like I was stickin' a contact lens
Let the hoes go

Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho (Let the hoes go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho

You say you're hittin' hard, huh, I say you're hardly hittin'
I grip you quick like the pussy in a kitten mitten
I'm gettin' grand or greater, sucker, catch you later
Keep gettin' paid with the fade of a Space Invader
You lookin' moonstruck, then you start to talkin' tough
Then sayin' sorry like I really give a motherfuck
You're little late, don't you think that was the wrong approach to
A sqwuab by the name Treach is sure to up and smoke you
At any time, anywhere, for any wanted cause
I got a double-barreled pump that's sayin', "Give me yours"
Then I'ma dash in a flash, duck and go for cover
'Cause I have warrants for this robbery and many others
Another gangster, no, I'm like an angry anchor
Droppin' you and gettin' mad if you don't say thank ya
The clip clockin' killers and plus my county crew
I got a contract for your life, now they're after you
So don't try to hide or apologize
Apologies ain't gon' need a franchise is wise
So if you know what I mean and have a hot block
And never ever seen a day when the money stops
You gotta put a fist up just to let me know
And gotta pump it hard and let the hoes go
Let the hoes go
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho (Let the hoes go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho

Competition on canvas, never have I heard a tongue
Throw a word to me without it being fuckin' hung
Give it a noose-job, neck him up and keep him learning
Should've had projects in the days of Mississippi Burning
I'd love to see the white sheet hit the concrete
And see that head go up and down from a thousand feet
'Cause the brothers 'round my way don't even play all that
They see a sheet and a cross, they say, "Oh, give me that"
Halloween in Illtown, now don't you be a ghost
'Cause you could get yoked, broke, or even worse, smoked
Now this rhyme has been called lyrically loco
But it had to have the flow to let the hoes go
Let the hoes go

Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho (Let the hoes go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho
