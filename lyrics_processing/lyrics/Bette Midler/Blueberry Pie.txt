And I don't know what to do
With that Blueberry Pie
But I'm gonna try
Oh, Blueberry Pie, sad and shy
Won't you come out of your shell?
Life is swell, so are you!
Please don't be so very blue
Come on blue! There is a party in your head
Be my friend and we will laugh 'til we turn red
Want to know why I picked you from the bunch?
You looked so sweet -- let's say I had a hunch
That you'd be silly, I'd be silly;
We'd be a pair!
Life is peachy, let's go bananas
No one will care!
Blueberry Pie, let's have fun
'cause when all is said and done
I love you, yes I do
'cause, Blueberry, you're true blue
Oh, Blueberry, you're so very berry blue
Oh, so very berry blue
I love a Blueberry. I hug a Blueberry
Oh, yes I do. You know I do
Irresistable you! Irrepresable you!
I love a Blueberry. I hug a Blueberry. I love a Blueberry
Don't you know it? I, I mean to show it
You know I mean to show it
Berry blue, berry, berry blue
You might also likeBlueberry Pie, he's from the upper-crust;
Rolling in dough, he's half-baked and bound to bust!
So don't be flaky
Come on, now, take me to your bakery
We'll be jamming, ovens slamming
The whole world will see
Blueberry Me! Without you
There would be no berry pie
Tell me why you can't see
You are necessary
Blueberry Pie, let's have fun
'cause when all is said and done
I love you, yes I do
'cause, Blueberry, you're true blue!
Oh, Blueberry, you're so very berry blue!
Oh, so very berry blue
I love a Blueberry. I hug a Blueberry. I love a Blueberry
Oh, love a Blueberry. He's so necessary, to people!
I love a Blueberry. I hug a Blueberry. I love a Blueberry
Oh, he's so necessary. He's so necessary
