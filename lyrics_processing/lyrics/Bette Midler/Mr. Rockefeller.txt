Mr. Rockefeller

If you'd like to send a few
Down my way

Mr. Rockefeller
I get my magazines
I've seen you on the TV too, yeah
Mr. Rockefeller, they tell me
They tell me all about it
But they don't tell me
How are you?

Sometimes I think I know you
Sometimes I think I don't
Sometimes I think we'll make it
Sometimes I think we won't

Waiting on the wire
And I'm ragged to the bone
Mr. Rockefeller
Won't you please pick up the phone?
Please pick up the phone

The reason I'm calling is to say

My family is nervous
And my thoughts are blue
But I wanna know, I gotta know
