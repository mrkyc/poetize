I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad, but it's a' hurtin'
All I want is for you to make love to me
I'll never be your beast of burden
I walk for miles, my feet are hurtin'
All I want is for you to make love to me
What's the matter with me?
Ain't I hot enough? Ain't I rough enough?
Ain't I rich enough? I'm not too blind to see, ohh, ohhh
I'll never be your beast of burden
So let's go home and draw the curtains
Put some music on the radio
C'mon, baby, make some love to me
Oh, what's the matter with me?
Ain't I hot enough? Ain't I rough enough?
Ain't I rich enough? I'm not too blind to see, ohh, ohhh
My little sister is a pretty pretty girl
My little sister is a pretty pretty girl
She loves to ride, she loves to crawl
They love to take her out behind the garden wall

And she don't have an awful lot to say
It hurts her so bad to come to the end
I re, I remember all the times she spent sayin', "Please"
Ain't I hot enough? Ain't I rough enough?
Ain't I rich enough? I'm not too blind to see, ohh, ohhh
Ohh, ohhhh
I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad, baby, but it's a' hurtin'
And all I want is you to make love to me
What's the matter, what's the matter with me?
Ain't I hot enough? Oooh, yeah, ain't I rough enough?
Oooh, yeah, ain't I rich enough, rich enough, rich enough
Too blind to see? Too blind, too blind, ohhhh
I'll never be your beast of burden
I walk for miles, honey, my feet are hurtin'
