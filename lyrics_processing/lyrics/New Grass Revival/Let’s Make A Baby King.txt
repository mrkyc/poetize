Once upon a Christmas morning
There was a pretty little baby boy
It seems like I remember sadness
Mingling with my joy
You see, Mary, she saw the future
And all the sorrow it would bring
That's when Mary started crying
When she heard the angels sing
Let's make a Baby King
(Let's make a Baby King)
Let's make Him Lord of all
(Let's make Him Lord of all)
Let's give Him everything
(Everything)
Let's make a Baby King
(Let's make a Baby King)
Well, now, you remember little King David
He's this little baby's kin
He was cousin to a man named John
I know you all remember Him
You might also likeWell, John said, "Let's get ready
And all you herald angels sing
And all this world also needs to know
The good news that I bring"
Let's make a Baby King
(Let's make a Baby King)
Let's make Him Lord of all
(Let's make Him Lord of all)
Let's give Him everything
(Everything)
Let's make a Baby King
(Let's make a Baby King)
Well, now we could use a revolution
This whole world's upside down
And we need a new direction
Got to turn this crazy thing around
We need a Lord to guide us
He's gonna show us the wrong from right
And we need a lamb to lead us
Into the land of the light
Let's make a Baby King
(Let's make a Baby King)
Let's make Him Lord of all
(Let's make Him Lord of all)
Let's give Him everything
(Everything)
Let's make a Baby King
(Let's make a Baby King)
Let's make Him Lord of all
(Let's make Him Lord of all)
Let's give Him everything
(Everything)
Let's make a Baby King
(Let's make a Baby King)
Let's give Him everything
(Everything)
Let's make a Baby King
