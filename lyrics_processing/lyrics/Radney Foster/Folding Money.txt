Verse:
Em G A C
When I was just a boy, my granddaddy took me to town one afternoon
Em G A C
He drove an LTD, wore a big white Stetson, and two-tone cowboy boots
Em G A C
He said son "Here goes" and handed me a twenty just to see the look on my face
Em n/c B7 (ring)
He said, "Don't tell your mama nothin' about it, don't spend it all in one place."
Chorus I
Em G
You see it takes foldin' money to get the deal done
A C
Foldin' money to have a little fun
Em G
Foldin' money to pay a few bills
A C
Eat a steak dinner, and cure a couple ills
Em G
Foldin' money, you need a little stash
A C
Some greenback dollars and cold hard cash
A B7
Save it for a rainy day or go away a little bit, son
Em G A C
It takes foldin' money...to get the deal done

'Cause when a man finds the courage to keep his cash, some romance is bound to start
Now romance is just like money...you can always get more if you've got it
And let me tell you friends, I'm a lot more handsome with a C note in my pocket
Chorus II
You see it takes foldin' money to get the deal done
Foldin' money to have a little fun
Foldin' money to pay a few bills
Take a girl dancing, and cure a couple ills
Foldin' money, you need a little stash
Some greenback dollars and cold hard cash
Save it for a rainy day or go away a little bit, son
It takes foldin' money...to get the deal done
Bass Solo
It's a pain in the back, it's a cold hard fact, gets to everybody sooner or later
You can give it to a charity and in some disparity, stock up your refrigerator
Couldn't marry it or date it, it'll kill you if you let it, you can blow it with nothing to show
It will make your wallet fatter, but the truth of the matter's can't take it with you when you go
Chorus III
Better spend a little foldin' money to get the deal done
Foldin' money to have a little fun
Foldin' money to pay a few bills
Spread a little 'round, and cure a couple ills
Foldin' money, you need a little stash
Some greenback dollars and cold hard cash
Save it for a rainy day or go away a little bit, son
It takes foldin' money...to get the deal done
