There's a curve in the highway, just south of town
Where a man has pulled over to figure life out
With only his conscience and the lonesome sound
Of diesels winding up grade
He's got a wife and two kids, and they love him so
A woman down in Georgia, and she's startin' to show
He's damned if he leaves her, and he's sure damned if he don't
And he wonders how life got this way

'Cause it's a fine line in between right and wrong
He's been crossing over that border way too long
He should've seen it coming at him right from the start
Now there ain't no escape from a broken heart

Now the call of the highway is a powerful thing
Like the pull of a lover, or a child in a swing
Gave his heart to two women, only one wears his ring
They're both gonna have his babies now
So how do you confess what words won't explain?
He never intended to cause this much pain
Now he feels like a farmer who went praying for the rain
Got more than he bargained from the clouds
You might also like
And it's a fine line in between right and wrong
Yeah, he's been crossing over that border way too long
He should've seen it coming at him right from the start
Now there ain't no escape from a broken heart

He'll turn his car around tonight
Go home and try to face the truth
Everyone involved's gettin' hurt
And there ain't nothing he can do, hey

He should've seen it coming at him right from the start
Now there ain't no escape, now there ain't no escape
From a fine line in between right and wrong
Yeah, he's been crossing over that border way too long
He should've seen it coming at him right from the start
Now there ain't no escape from a broken heart
Now there ain't no escape from a broken heart
Yeah, they're all gonna wind up with a broken heart
