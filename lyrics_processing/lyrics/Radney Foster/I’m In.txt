Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this I gave you that
It's scary business
Your heart and soul is on the line
Baby why else would I be standing 'round here so tongue tied

If I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm in, I'm in
Baby, I'm in, I'm in

Baby, come on in, the water's fine
I'll be right here, You take your time
Just let me hold you
And we'll both take that leap of faith
It's like I told you there's no guarantees
When you feel this way
You might also like
If I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in, I'm in

Baby, come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe
I can pour out everything I am

If I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm in, I'm in
Baby, I'm in, I'm in
I'm in I'm in
Baby come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe
I can pour out everything I am
Baby come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe
I can pour out everything I am
Baby come here next to me
