I can see her in that water
Church dress hung up in a tree
Splashing flirtin' laughin', teasin' me
That afternoon of secrets
Swimming naked in a pool of dreams
Last high school summer dripping dry by Sycamore Creek

She kissed me one last time
Headin' home
And I'm still haunted by what she said
When I'm alone

She said you got a chance to be
Free of all this small town strings
That tie the rest of us down
She said boy quit your hanging around
Take that guitar and run
Faster than the setting sun
You can write a song later about my memory
You can always come back
You can always come back
To Sycamore Creek
You might also like
Well the guitar made the magic
And I just hung on for the ride
I walked amongst giants played with legends side by side
She came to see me in New Orleans
And on a tour bus after the show
I kissed goodbye to the one I never shoulda let go

She said you got a chance to be
So wild on those guitar strings
Stage lights in every town
So head up when you're hanging around
Take that guitar and run
Faster than the setting sun
You can write a song later about my memory
You can always come back
You can always come back
To Sycamore Creek

Well I knew she'd gotten married
And I always forget the guy's name
But he played tight end the year we won district
It got bad and it got ugly
Through tears one night she called
I drove ten hours to the water
I couldn't resist it
I said girl you got a chance to be
Free of all these small town strings
Cut the ties that keep you down
I said girl quit your hanging around
Take this money and run
Faster than the setting sun
She soaked my shirt crying over memories
She said don't ever come back
No never come back
