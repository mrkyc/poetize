Pot luck supper and barbecue
A cooler full of beer one for sodas too
Us kids chasing fireflies with no shoes
Saturday sundown
Momma hollerin' y'all wash up
Clean that plate with your cornbread crust
Don't drink from daddy's dixie cup
Oh the guitars are comin' out

When those cedar planks rattled and moaned
Rocked and rolled to a country song
On a couple of Sunburst Flattops
And a hand-me-down mandolin
Sometimes they had the chords half wrong
We laughed and cried, sang along
Family friends harmony
And goosebumps on my skin
You can't put a price on what those nights were worth
It was the greatest, the greatest show on Earth

Some sang low some high and lonesome
Will that circle be unbroken
Grab a part if you know one
Or clap along instead
Son if you want to touch a guitar, ask
Sister sleepin' and eight kids laughing
I'd shake it like Elvis just to make 'em laugh
Before I went to bed
You might also like
When those cedar planks rattled and moaned
Rocked and rolled to a country song
On a couple of Sunburst flattops
And a hand-me-down mandolin
Sometimes they had the chords half wrong
We laughed and cried and sang along
Family friends harmony
And goosebumps on my skin
You can't put a price on what those nights were worth
It was the greatest, the greatest show on Earth

Take a little break
Talk a little fishin'
Let the crickets sing the intermission
I'd drift off to dreamland
And they'd fire it up again

When those cedar planks rattled and moaned
Rocked and rolled to a country song
On a couple of Sunburst flattops
And a hand-me-down mandolin
Sometimes they had the chords half wrong
We laughed and cried and sang along
Family friends harmony
And goosebumps on my skin
You can't put a price on what those nights were worth
