Take care, my love
Oh, the diamonds on the sea look like your eyes to me
Hold me in your arms, babe, I need to sleep
Sing me a song with a voice so sweet
That could calm all the oceans and part the sea
I never met another one like you before
Talking all night long
From the midnight on
Oh baby, I never met another one like you before
Talking all night long
From the midnight on
If you stand beside me baby, I'll be seeing through
I can't say that I know the way
The darkest nights, they all look the same
We can let the breezes blow
For dust to where the flowers grow
Let me look at you, let me look at you
Oh, I'm pumping fresh blood for you
Let me look at you, let me look at you
Oh, I'm pumping fresh blood for you
Baby, keep me warm, baby, keep me cold
If everything is right then, baby, nothing is wrong
Love me all you can before our time is gone
You might also likeOh baby, I never met another one like you before
Talking all night long
From the midnight on
Oh baby, I never met another one like you before
Talking all night long
From the midnight on
(The diamonds on the sea look like your eyes to me
Hold me in your arms, babe, I need to sleep)
Oh put your hand inside mine, baby, oh, we'll see this loving through
I remember so well and I remember so much
Ain't nothing healing like the human touch
And love will make a flower grow
And blossom 'til its color show
Let me look at you, let me look at you
Oh, I'm pumping fresh blood for you
Let me look at you, let me look at you
Oh, I'm pumping fresh blood for you
Let me look at you, let me look at you
Oh, I'm pumping fresh blood for you
(Baby)
Talking all night long
From the midnight on
My baby, where have you been? Where have you been, like hidden?
You know that I'm in love with you, baby
You know that I'm in love with you, baby
You know that I'm in love with you
Talking all night long
From the midnight on
Talking all night long
