Well, don't you ever give me false hope
Don't you ever give a man false hope
Let's move on then, it brings me down
Maybe I can face it another way
Well, you drank ruin and I drank wine, it's okay, it's okay
I'll be here in the end
Or do we all die unhealed?
Holy moly, what's wrong with ya?
I've been laying so low
Maybe these two fingers can pray for ya
Well, don't you ever give me false hope
Don't you ever give a man false hope, false hope
Our hometowns, there aren't simple things
And home isn't always where we think it is
All the people we trust to stand up for us
The people we trust to hold onto us
The people we trust to deliver us
Holy moly, what's wrong with ya?
I've been laying so low
Maybe these two fuckers could pray for ya
Well, don't you ever give me false hope
Don't you ever give a man false hope, false hope
Holy moly, what's wrong with ya?
What's wrong with ya? What's wrong with ya?
You might also likeI've got the craters of volcanoes to hide my shame
I remember so much so well
The night of us  forgotten we all regret
I want that feeling more, love is home
 x3
Fuck them all, love is home
Home is love, fuck them all
Fuck them all, love is home
Home is love, love is home
Holy moly, what's wrong with ya?
I've been laying so low
Maybe these two fuckers could pray for you (I will not give anymore)
Well, don't you ever give me false hope
Don't you ever give a man false hope, false hope (I will not give anymore)
Holy moly, what's wrong with ya? (I will not give anymore)
What's wrong with ya? What's wrong with ya? (I will not give anymore)
What's wrong with ya? (I will not give anymore)
