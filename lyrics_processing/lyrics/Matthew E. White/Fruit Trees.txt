The radiance of an orange tree
You and me in the middle of a field
The fragrance of an orange blossom
You and me in the middle of a field
Oh let me sleep in your tent tonight
Lemon and mint tonight
You and me in the middle of a field
Oh let me sleep in your tent tonight
Women and men tonight
You and me in the middle of a field

Me and you they call us wild wild wild wild
You and me
Two Coca-Colas in the shade of crushed ice
We found a place for two
And we're running things me and you
I'm parking at the fruit trees
Honey that's just you and me
The spectacle of a cherry tree
You and me in the middle of a dream
Charm like a falling cherry blossom
You and me in the middle of a dream
Oh let me be by your side tonight
Southern lights inside my head tonight
You and me in the middle of a dream
Sleep well sweet dreams good night and good morning
Sleep well sweet dreams good night and good morning
You and me in the middle of a color field
You might also like
Me and you they call us wild wild wild wild
You and me
Two Coca-Colas in the shade of crushed ice
We found a place for two
And we're running things me and you
I'm parking at the fruit trees
Honey that's just you and me
Me and you we go to town in the summertime
You and me always keep the windows down down in the summertime
Light me on fire and let me burn
Baby this is how we're supposed to love
Shake it like a fruit tree
Honey that's just you and me

Ships from the ocean
Planes in the sky
Waves but like steel blue mountains
Could never crush you and I
Ships from the ocean
Planes cross the sea
Waves build like steel blue mountains
Will never touch you and me

Love can you feel the breeze
Is it all just you and me baby?
Couple  from the tree
 piece of mind
Just as long as it's understood baby
Just as long as it's understood baby
