Fresh out the gutta city, shed no teardrops for pity
Can't even see straight, can't even see straight
I ain't no blower don't confuse me with them swisha movers
Switch up the plans you hatin' but whats it to ya
Tryna get all this money so we don't use no rulers
Big bank lil' stack for my prosecutors
Any against the team take a clip from a ruger
My mans doing time, shout out to west and luther
Loving these hoes? I'm never loving these hoes
I neck em and pass em to the team, I'm about my zeros, fo'sho
Success on my brain, the night on my mind
Hoes on my dick, getting ready to grind
I did a couple things that I ain't really proud of
But if it wasn't for them things I wouldn't found love
So write my diary of you think you know the real me
Shit that I peeped out, have niggas be tryna kill me
If I ain't the realest than I don't know what real is
Exercising my demons, I'm doing crunches
The media more fucked up than falling out of love is
Ask about my life, guarantee I love it
Though the tough times, I still rise above this
Keep my live low so you they don't know nothing
Live or not, they always talking 'bout something
Told em keep my name out their mouth but I see they still talkin'
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, get it in the end
'Cuz when it's all over you won't see it again
Gotta live life up, gotta live it to the fullest
'Cuz you'll never know in the city full of bullets

I been down the road to hell & back
Killing games and hanging racks
Girls be tryna give the sign
But I don't got no time for that
This motivation thing right here
Come from the very mind I rap
In a few hours
I'mma be sailing with a weather map
'Cuz I'mma make it rain
Even with the fame
Ill still be the same
Wake up in the morning and do it all again
Times have changed, its a new day
You gettin' money? oh yeah touche?
But not touching my hustle muscle getting stronger by the pay
If I lived my life over I wouldn't have I any other way
Forget what the haters say their inner jeans looking mighty gray
They getting wetter by the wordplay make em blow like its their birthday
Show em no mercy the cold way while I listen to some Coldplay
Illest nigga up and up any nigga get the fakin'
He catching an uppercut
Im just a guy giving praises to the higher ups
Rep a set EOH tell the crew wassup
They loving us, groupie fiends can't get enough
Yeah, yeah, get it in the end
'Cuz when it's all over you won't see it again
Gotta live life up, gotta live it to the fullest
