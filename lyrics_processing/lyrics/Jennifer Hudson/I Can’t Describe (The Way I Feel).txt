I can't describe (The way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (C'mon, tell 'em shawty, aye) (The way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (Aye, okay) (The way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (Okay, aye) (The way I feel, the way I feel)
(Okay)

I feel like I'm in love
That is nice but not good enough
I feel like saying something that's for us
That defines what's in our hearts, ooh-oh

Dancing and we're playin' around, you know you got me
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I never found the words to describe it

I can't describe (The way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (The way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (The way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (The way I feel, the way I feel)
Uh, uh come on, uh come on, yeah
You might also like
This feels right, just staying up
And you don't describe when it's not
I can feel my heartbeat thumping from your touch
In my life, you are my love, oh

Dancing and we playin' around, you know you got me
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I never found the words to describe it

I can't describe (The way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (The way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (The way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (The way I feel, the way I feel)
Uh come on, uh come on, uh come on

In the morning, hopefully you'll tell me why we're both yawning
But right now, think about it later, boy just love me now

Wait a minute now
Come on Shawty, you already know 'bout me
In the summer, Barcelona, Monaco I be (Yeah)
Kickin' flave on the Gold Coast, doin' the mo' (Woo!)
We poppin' gold bottles, twenty thousand a toast (Okay)
In Ibiza, you and me can take a walk on the moon
My watch got it showin' in the middle of June
And we can kick it on the water when it's hot in the street (Yeah)
On the yacht, somewhere South of Paris (Gettin' money)
I'll let you get the Black Card if you play you're right
Make you shine on sight, any day or night
I could never be as bad I just say I be (Well...)
But I could be good if the wood be good (Maybe, yo)
In the drop top, park downtown, gettin' to it
Let you have it like a true dope boy should
Let the neighbors all hear you when i'm doing something to it 'Cause we wake em all up, 'cause we tear em all up, yeah
I can't describe (Wait a minute now) (The way I feel, the way I feel) (Uh-huh, uh-huh, go)
Oh what a high (The way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (The way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (The way I feel, the way I feel)

Dancing and we playin' around, you know you got me (Uh, okay)
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body (And how you like it, shawty?)
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh, it tingles everywhere (Aye, ooh)
That's why I never found the words to describe it (Aye, one, two, go)

I can't describe (The way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (The way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (The way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (The way I feel, the way I feel)

I can't describe (The way I feel, the way I feel)
