Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
My momma used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing
Says he was in the war in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
I Brokedown and I asked him one time
How ya keep from going crazy
He said: "I'll see my son and wife in just a little while"
I asked him what he meant
He looked at me and smiled and said

I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh I believe

A few years later, I was off to college
Talkin' on the phone with my mama one night
Getting all caught up in the gossip of the small-town life
She said, oh, by the way child, old man Wrigley's died
Later on that night, I laid there thinkin' back
Thought 'bout a couple of long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Who deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye and said
You might also like
I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh

I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live
Yeah, this can't be, no, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is

When I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh I believe

Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I still believe
Do you believe?
Because I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
