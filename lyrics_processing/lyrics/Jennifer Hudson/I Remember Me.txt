I remember me, staring at myself
See these same two eyes, see these same two feet
I remember you, you who I used to be
You still look the same, but you don't hurt like me

Look at my reflection, somewhere my affection
Disappeared, isn't here, nothing left to say
Memories they fading, but I'm the one who made them
So I keep the love close to enough to say

What if this life is all that we are given?
We just can't stop living, scared of what we'll see
'Cause in this world, anything can hurt you
Push you, then forget you
Stole my history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die
I remember me, I remember me
Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
You might also like
I tell you what my name is
And ain't nothing gon' change it
'Cause what you are is what you are
Even if your memory's flawed
I go to places, trying to find familiar faces
They don't show, but I still know
They don't have to look for me

I dream about, I dream about
The place where all the broken pieces fit together
'Cause in this world, anything can hurt you
It'll push you, then forget you
Stole my history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go (Oh!), what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die
I remember me

Now all that's left of these hands, this breathe
I've said goodbye to so many things that tears won't cry
And I take this pain, this joy, and rain
'Cause all that matters now is...
In this life, anything can hurt you
Push you then forget you
Erase your history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go (Ah, hey), what I'm told (Hey, yeah), now you know (I remember!)
I remember me, I remember me (Who I used to be, yeah)
Even if I say goodbye (Say goodbye), start to cry (Start to cry), do or die
I remember me, I remember me
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

I remember me, I tell you what my name is
I tell you what my name is
