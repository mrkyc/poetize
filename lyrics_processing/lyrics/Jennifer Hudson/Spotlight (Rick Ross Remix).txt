Jennifer Hudson, what's up sexy?
It's so appropriate that we got aquainted
Yea, it's been well overdue
It's deeper than rap right here though
I'm in my own lane, I'm not one of the same
All in ya ear like I'm running my game
Still 'bout things, when she want me to change
The mere mention of my name, they think money and fame
Your friends wanna know, what our life like
You ain't gotta lie, the spotlight bright
But it's not like, your not my type
'Cause ya quite hot, and light my life
Light that candle, spice my night
Let the top down, let life fly by us
Is this a dream girl, I'm with my dream girl
Singin' like I came in the middle of queens girl
You more mature than the girl before
You shinin' so bright, the world is yours
Head over hills, in love with a d-boy
But I bought a ring with me to sum the ecore
Boss
Well I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
Oh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
Is this a relationship fulfilling your needs as well as mine?
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?
Or is this just my sentence, am I doing time?
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?
Ooh If this is love, real real love, then I'm staying no doubt
Is that true? Is that true? It that true?
But if I'm just loves prisoner, then I'm busting out
Is that true? Is that true? Is that true?
Oh baby I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
Oh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
Oh you outta be, ashamed of yourself
What the hell do you think your doing?
Loving me, loving me, so wrong
Baby all I do is try
To show you that your mine
One and only guy
No matter who may come along
Open your eyes 'cause baby I don't like
Yea
I want to talk baby
I let you talk
Now let me talk
You couldn't imagine the things that I phathom
Stepping out a cab, and then to my phatom
Girl you a star, got my own status
So it ain't about the money, it's you that really matter
Made for each other, so we stay together
Like the camma tattos when we lay together
Friends talk about me, they can say whatever
But we build a close bond, we even pray together Holla
Ohhh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
Oh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
