Hands up
If you with me, put your hands up
Hands up
Wait a minute, wait a minute ya'll

They told me that love was simply not enough
With all that we been through
We should give it up
Why sweat and cry
Just leave and make it easy
I told em' it would hurt me worst
But they just don't believe me

Been locked up, bailed out
Broke, overdrawn
Staying at my momma's house
Ya'll don't know what I'm talking bout
Like gangstas we gone strap up for this war
And I'd die for mine
Cause you're worth fighting for

Can't nobody tell me bout this here (Oh no)
Now let me make it clear (I won't)
Let everything we've done in the name of love (Us)
Done in the name of love (Love)
Be nothing
So I'm a fight for you
You gone fight for me
I'ma fight for you
That's how it's gone be
We gon' fight
You might also like
Why trip on conversations 'bout our past
Like we didn't make it
Like we didn't man up and take it
Straight up and with you, we go back like Philip Bailey
I know I'm crazy
That's how you made me

Been locked up, bailed out
Broke, overdrawn
Staying at my momma's house
Ya'll don't know what I'm talking bout
Like gangstas we gone strap up for this war
And I'd die for mine
Cause you're worth fighting for

Can't nobody tell me bout this here (Oh no)
Now let me make it clear (I won't)
Let everything we've done in the name of love (Us)
Done in the name of love (Love)
Be nothing
So I'm a fight for you
You gon' fight for me
I'ma fight for you
That's how it's gon' be
We gon' fight
Fight because we should
On everything that's good
I can't leave (We've come to far to turn back)
And to the haters that we shook
Giving us dirty looks
Watch and see (No matter what goes)
No matter what (Stays)
Ain't gon' let nobody tear us down
We going all twelve rounds
Let's put em up (No)
No giving up (We)
We gon' make it just because
Because we gon' fight for love

Can't nobody tell me bout this here (Oh no)
Now let me make it clear (I won't)
Let everything we've done in the name of love (Us)
Done in the name of love (Love)
Be nothing
So I'm a fight for you
You gon' fight for me
I'ma fight for you
That's how it's gon' be
We gon' fight
We gon' fight
Holla if you hear me
We gon' fight
This thing is getting rid of me
We gon' fight
Put ya hands up if you feel me
