And now the courageous, the curvaceus Creamettes!

It's the Dreamettes! The Dreamettes!

Move, move, move right out of my life
Move, move, move right out of my life

You better move (Move)
You're steppin' on my heart
I said, "move" (Move) you're tearin' it apart
Please move (Please move!)
Oh, what am I gonna do? My heart (My heart)
Is breakin' breakin' up over you
(Breakin', breakin' up over you)

You've got a such magnetic power
That just keeps holding me down
I feel just like a flower
That you're keeping stuck in the ground, ground, ground, oh

Move, move, move right out of my life!
Move it, move it out of my life
Move, move, move right out of my life
Move it, move it out of my life
Move, move, move right out of my life
You might also like
You are so horribly satanic
The way you lead me around
I feel just like the Titanic
I'm always going down, down, down, down

Move, move
You're steppin' on my style You're steppin' on my style
Yes you are, I said
Move, move "Move!"
I want to breathe for a while I want to breathe for a while
Move, move, move right out of my life Hey, baby
Move it, move it out of my life Hey, baby

Get out of my life Move, move, move
There's too much pain and strife Right out of my life!
So why don't you pack it up and Move it, move it
Move it? Out of my life!
Take your cat, kit, and kaboodle Move, move
Take your broken down car Move
Your smelly cigar Move
And just, move right out of my Move, move
Move right out of my life!
Please move, move, move, move
Please move, move, move, move
Please move, move, move, move
Please move, move, move, move
