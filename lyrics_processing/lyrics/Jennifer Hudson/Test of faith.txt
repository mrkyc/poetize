Is all I have left
That's not enough
But it's my best
So I'll set you free
Pray that you'll fly
Come back to me
Better than I
You've got my mother's eyes and
You've got my father's hands
And mama can't teach you things you can only learn from a man
Our hearts beat in sync
So I'm gonna be off beat
Until the day you come back to me
In the meantime
I'll be wishin' on stars
Praying for change
And mendin' my heart
In the meantime
Cry myself away
'Cause there's no testament
Without a test of faith
Faith, oh, mmmm...
I look in your eyes
And I see myself
But you're so much better
Be someone else
'Cause I let you down
It's time you get up
And fight for yourself
'Cause I messed things up
You might also likeYou've got my attitude and
You've got your daddy's blues
Want you to see love can be faithful and true
Our hearts beat in sync
So I'm gonna be off beat
And hope someday is sooner than we think
In the meantime
I'll be wishin' on stars
And praying for change
And mendin' my heart
In the meantime
I'll cry myself away
'Cause there's no testamony
Without a test of faith
Faith, oh
Hold on
So afraid when you came in this world
I was just a little girl
Lost, trying to find my way
Still searching for myself
Still hurting, need some help
Go, We're gonna get through this thing
In the meantime
We'll be wishin' on stars
And praying for change
And mendin' my heart
(In the meantime)
I'll keep praying
(prayin' for change and mendin' my heart)
I'll be prayin', ooh...
('Til I get to where you are
In the meantime)
In the meantime
(I will trust in things that I can see, other half is dibelief)
I keep prayin'
(In the meantime)
The meantime, oh...
(prayin' for change and mendin' my heart)
Not together, yet never apart
Leave the light on for me
Promise baby I'll be, oh
Hush little baby, don't cry
You'll understand in due time
Hush little baby, don't say a thing
Distance will never come between us
Oh, oh
