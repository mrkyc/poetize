When you can wear what you feel
What do you wanna say?
Now love is a little number that you can wear each day
As long as you let me be the accessory
Simply send me on my way
'Cause I love love
I look good in love

When it's been out of sight and out of mind for such a long time
That's how one forgets
So I reached in the back of my closet, pulled it out
And I tried it on, and it still fits
Some cover their pain up with lots of MAC make-up
But I can't help but blush
'Cause I'm in love
All dressed up in love

I'm all dressed up in love
And I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter (I ain't cold)
I'm all dressed up in love
And I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter
'Cause I'm in love
All dressed up in love

People are looking (Yeah), some even staring
I know I'm glowing when they ask me what I'm wearing
See this old thing, y'all, it's great for any weather
My friend and I sit down and we both made it together
Now if you really, huh, want one of your own
I hope your shoes are made for walking
'Cause I found love
And you must find love, ah, ah yeah

I'm all dressed up in love
And I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter (Woo! I love it)
I'm all dressed up in love (Dressed up in love)
And I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter (Woo! I'm super warm)
I'm all dressed up in love (Dressed up in love)
And I'm cool in the summer (Summer), warm in the winter (Eh)
I'm all dressed up in love
'Cause I found love
And you must find love

Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
I found it!
