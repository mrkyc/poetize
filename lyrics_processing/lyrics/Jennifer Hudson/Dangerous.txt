I do it for the thrill, even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
I do it for the thrill, even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
Touch my body
You make me feel like I'm a lie
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous

Dangerous, like like no hands on a motorbike
Ridin' at the speed of light
When I'm with you, ride like brass knuckles in a street fight
I got you, you got me right
Like there ain't no daddy do, do or die
Tat my name so I know you're mine

Daddy you, know that I die for you, die for you
Daddy do, do or die
Stay with me 'till end of time
Daddy you know that I die for you, ride for you

I do it for the thrill, even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
I do it for the thrill, even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
Touch my body
You make me feel like I'm a lie
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous

Dangerous, yeah, yeah, think we're running from the cops now
Even if we get caught now
Anything for you
Yeah, yeah, hold my body up for ransom
'Cause I wanna get hands on, hands on
Yeah, I wanna get my hands on
Daddy do, do or die
Tat' my name so I know you're mine

Daddy you, know that I die for you, die for you
Daddy do, do or die
Stay with me 'till end of time
Daddy you know that I die for you, ride for you

I do it for the thrill
Don't back down, I dare you
Break the rules, live loud, loud
Oh, giving me life
Make me feel alive

I do it for the thrill, even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
I do it for the thrill, even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
Touch my body, oh
You make me feel like I'm a lie
I do it for the thrill even if it kills
Dangerous, you make me feel dangerous
