Yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah

You said when the storm came
That you would be there with your umbrella to block the rain
And you said you'd protect me
From heartache, pain, lies, loneliness and misery
You said you'd tear down the walls that were in the way
You promised things would be okay
And I stood there, in the freezing cold
And I waited for ya, but you never showed

(Where you at?) Ooh
(Where you at?) Ooh-oh
(Where you at?) Boy, you said you would be here for me
(Where you at?) Where you at?
(Where you at?) Where you at?
(Where you at?) Where you at?

Now you said you'll go to church
Stop the slanging, find a real job and go to work
And you say you'd stay out the streets and spend more time with me
Take away my doubts and fears, and fulfill my dreams
You said you'd be that shoulder for my eyes to cry on
Said you would be that one that I could depend on
And I stood there, in the freezing cold
And I waited for ya, but you never showed, boy
You might also like
(Where you at?) Where you at?
(Where you at?) Where you at?
(Where you at?) Boy, you said you would be here for me
(Where you at?) Where?
(Where you at?) Where you at?
(Where you at?) Where you at?

And those false promises is much like fake names
You painted a picture for me, but there was no frame
You made my future look bright, and I believed every word
I went to sleep on a cloud and woke up in the dirt
And now I'm without shelter and the wind is blowing
You said you'd be there for me, boy, when the tough got going
Said if weapons formed, you'd stand in front of me
Whenever I felt trapped, said you'd be the one to set me free
Thought you were my hero, but as it turned out, you were no show

Tell me where...
(Where you at?) ...You at?
(Where you at?) Where you at, babe?
(Where you at?) Oh, you said you'd be there for me
(Where you at?) Where you at?
(Where you at?) Baby, where you at?
(Where you at?) You said you'd be right there for me
(Where you at?) And I can't
(Where you at?) See
(Where you at?) See, see
(Where you at?) See
(Where you at? Where you at?) You said you'd be right there for me
(Where you at?) So I'm waiting on ya
(Where you at?) Right here
(Where you at?) Until you appear
And deliver (Deliver)
Deliver (Deliver)
Deliver (Deliver)
Deliver, boy
Deliver (Where you at?)
Deliver (Where you at?)
