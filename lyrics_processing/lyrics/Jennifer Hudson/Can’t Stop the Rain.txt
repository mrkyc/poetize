Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

27th of January
Think he died a year ago today
She's crying on my shoulder
And begging me to make the hurting go away
Pretty brown eyes, tears full of guilt
A heart full of pain and fear
I wanna tell her it's okay
But we both know she's the reason he's not here

I keep on crying
But it doesn't seem to help at all (Seem to help at all)
With every single teardrop, it's like another raindrop falls
And I would (And I would) if I could (If I could)
But the try would be in vain (The try would be in vain)
Said no matter what I do, I can't stop the rain
So I cry
Ooh, I can't stop the rain (Stop the rain)
Ooh, I can't stop the rain (Stop the rain)
If I could, you know I would, but the try would be in vain
So I cry
Ooh, I can't stop the rain (Stop the rain)

Faded picture in a little gold locket
And she never takes it off
I know it's small, but it's heavy 'cause it's filled with guilt
I know and she's why his life is lost
I feel bad for her, but I'm having mixed emotions
'Cause he was a friend of mine
Somewhere in the deepest darkest part of my mind
I wish it was her that died that night, ooh

I keep on crying
But it doesn't seem to help at all (Seem to help at all)
With every single teardrop, it's like another raindrop falls
And I would (And I would) if I could (If I could)
But the try would be in vain (The try would be in vain)
Said no matter what I do, I can't stop the rain
So I cry
Ooh, I can't stop the rain (Stop the rain)
Ooh, I can't stop the rain (Stop the rain)
If I could, you know I would, but the try would be in vain
So I cry
Ooh, I can't stop the rain (Stop the rain)

One rainy Saturday night, a happy anniversary
Celebrating love, champagne all around
They had a little too much to drink
They got in the car, and he could barely stand up
So she figured that she'd drive
Staring at him, I suppose, a sudden jerk of the wheel
And the car flipped about three times, ooh
I keep on crying
But it doesn't seem to help at all (Seem to help at all)
With every single teardrop, it's like another raindrop falls
And I would (And I would) if I could (If I could)
But the try would be in vain (The try would be in vain)
Said no matter what I do, I can't stop the rain
So I cry
Ooh, I can't stop the rain (Stop the rain)
Ooh, I can't stop the rain (Stop the rain)
If I could, you know I would, but the try would be in vain
