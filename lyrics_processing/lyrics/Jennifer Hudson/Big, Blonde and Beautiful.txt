Once upon a time, girl, I was just like you
Never let my extra large largesse shine through
Hair was brown and nappy never had no fun
I hid under a bushel which is easier said than done
Then one day my grandma, who was big and stout
She said you gotta love yourself from inside out
And just as soon as I learned how to strut my funky stuff
I found out that the world at large can't get enough, so...
Bring on that pecan pie pour some sugar on it
Sugar, don't be shy
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl
Don't be stingy I'm a growing girl
I offer big love with no apology
How can I deny the world the most of me
I am not afraid to throw my weight around
Pound by pound by pound
Because I'm
Big, blonde and beautiful
There is nothin' 'bout me
That's unsuitable
No one wants a meal that only offers the least
When girl we're servin' up the whole damn feast
You might also likeSlice off a piece of that hog head cheese
Then take a look inside my book of recipes
Now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light
I need a man who brings a man-sized appetite
I'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice
I'll let ya lick the spoon because it tastes so nice
I keep it in my oven 'til it's good and hot
Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot
Because I'm
Big, blonde and beautiful
And Edna, girl, you're lookin' so recruitable
Why sit in the bleachers
Timid and afraid when Edna
You can be your own parade

So? How 'bout it, Mama?

Well, I am big, I am blonde, and if you say I'm beautiful...

You're beautiful! Ruff!

Alright, I'll do it!
Yeah, look out old Baltimore
We're marching in
'And we ain't shufflin'
Through that old back door

And Tracy, I will join your fight if I can keep up this pace

And girls, I'll be right at your side if I can find some space

So they can gaze in wonder
As you're spreadin' your wings
You know that it ain't over
'Til the fat lady sings
Tomorrow, side by side
We'll show the world what's right

Then we'll have chicken parmigiana tonight

Then we'll be big, blonde, and beautiful
It's time to face the fact
It's irrefutable
Can't ya hear that rumbling?
That's our hunger to be free
It's time to finally taste equality

On mother, daughter day
Where thin is in, we're white as wool

Well, ladies, big is back
And as for black, it's beautiful
All shapes and sizes, follow me

Let's bust their chops

Quick, call the cops!

We're gonna dance our way to victory!

Stay away, this isn't Negro Day

2, 4, 6, 8, TV'S got to integrate

We're here to dance

We're here to stay!

Arrest that one!

Link, help me, please!

Big, blonde and beautiful leads the way
