When you feel you're taking all that you can take
And you're sure you're never gonna catch a break
And the tears are rivers running down your face, yeah
When your faith is low and you've got no strength left
When you think you've gone as far as you can get
And you're too run down to take another step

Oh I will take up the struggle
Oh I know it's a fight

So I'll fight, fight that war for you
I'll fight, stand and defend you
Take your side, that's what I'm here to do
I'll be there to be strong
Oh I'll keep on, keep on the fight

When it's dangerous, takes another piece of you
Everybody takes all they can get from you
'Till you're left with almost nothing left of you, oh ah
When each night is like a battle you can't win
And the pain is like a weight you're carrying
I will be the one to help you carry it
You might also like
Oh I will take all your troubles
Oh I know it's a fight

So I'll fight, fight that war for you
I'll fight, stand and defend you
Take your side, that's what I'm here to do
I'll be there to be strong
Oh I'll keep on, keep on the fight

I'll help your back when your back's to the wall
I'll catch the tears when your tears fall
I will give it all, I won't give up the fight

So I'll fight, fight that war for you
I'll fight, stand and defend you
Take your side, that's what I'm here to do
I'll be there to be strong
Oh I'll keep on, keep on

I'll fight, fight that war for you
I'll fight, stand and defend you
Take your side, take your side, take your side
That's what I'm here to do
I'll be there to be strong (I'll be there, I'll be strong)
Oh I'll keep on, keep on
