Anything that you want from me
Boy, you can get it any time, any place (Oh, whoa)
I'll be your servant, your slave
Your everything you ever wanted, baby (Oh, whoa)
Just make one wish and I'll become your genie
Your go-get-it, your "bring it back and give it to you" babe (Oh, whoa)
I walk over that rainbow and deliver to you that pot of gold
Got the whole Earth in the box, wrapped in a bow for you

It's your world, yeah
It's your world, baby
It's your world, baby
And everything in it
It's your world, oh
It's your world, baby
It's your world
Boy if you ask, it shall be given
It's your world
It's your world

All of your worries, your cares, your doubts
Give 'em to me and I'll erase them for you (Oh, whoa)
I'll be your heaven, your blessing, no stressing
Boy I'll make all your dreams come true (Oh, whoa)
No matter what it is, just say what it is
And I will do it for you (Oh, whoa)
I'll walk a mile, I'll swim the Nile, I'll vow
Sink my finger in the ground
And turn this Earth around for you
You might also like
'Cause it's your world
It's your world, baby
It's your world, baby
And everything in it
It's your world, oh
It's your world
It's your world
Boy if you ask, it shall be given
It's your world
It's your world

See a woman like you, babe
Shouldn't have to ask for nothing, baby, no, no, no
You should have the world, baby
Right in the palms of your hands, oh boy
Just tell me what to do, whoa
Make your life a better life for you
Anything your heart desire, babe
See I am born to make it happen, babe
All you've gotta do, mm, no, no
Is tell me that it's me you want loving you
And as long as you keep giving me that sweet love
Point to it baby, and it belongs to you
If it's money you want (It's nothing)
Want me to pay your bills (It's nothing)
Buy you nice things (It's nothing)
Shopping sprees

If you're in need of love (It's nothing)
Boy it don't matter what (It's nothing)
Even the moon and the stars above (It's nothing)
You can have my heart (It's nothing)
You can have my car (It's nothing)
I'll cut it out of me (It's nothing)
And give you my heart (It's nothing)
See that Universe (It's nothing)
And all of the planets (It's nothing)
Belongs to you (It's nothing)
Just reach up and grab it (It's nothing)
