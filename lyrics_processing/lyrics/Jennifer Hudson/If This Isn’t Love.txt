You're officially tuned in to a BBK Classic (Classic)
Right about now

I'm calling his phone up just to tell him how much
I really love him 'cause he's everything I want
He listens to me, cares for me
So I truly believe

God has sent me an angel up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect
Only because it's the only way I can describe, so

If this isn't love
Tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy
If this isn't love
Tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this, baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
You might also like
I'm selfish 'cause I don't wanna share him with nobody
Not even those people that came before me
But see, I never believe

God has sent me an angel up from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect
It's the only because it's the only way I can describe, so

If this isn't love (Oh, ooh)
Tell me what it is
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy, no
If this isn't love (No)
Tell me what it is
'Cause I never felt like this, baby
If this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh

So if you got real love
Let me see you put your hands up (Oh!)
See you put your hands up
The kind of love that fits tight like a glove
Let me see you put your hands up (Oh)
See you put your hands up (Put your hands up)
If this isn't love
'Cause I know I ain't crazy, I know I ain't trippin'
I know I ain't slippin', I know that it's love
See me with my hands up
If you think I'm dreaming, I know I ain't dreaming (Oh)
'Cause this reason maybe and I know what is love
If this isn't love!
If this isn't love
Tell me what it is (Oh)
'Cause I could be dreaming or just plain crazy (Dreaming, crazy)
If this isn't love (This isn't love)
Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
'Cause I never felt like this, baby (Oh)
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love (Love)
L-O-V-E, what it means to me
L-O-V-E, oh, if this isn't love

Love
L-O-V-E
