Whoa, whoa
One, two, three four
What's up, girl?
Let me holler at you for a second
I just want you to know
All of those other girls
They never meant anything to me
You're the only one for me

You turned me on, sounds so good talking fast
But before we go on, there's something I should ask
Not about your past, 'cause I don't care who came before me
No, my maturity is bigger than that
I am more curious 'bout what you truly want
Do I sense sincerity or just good talk?
I don't care about the rumor mill
But be understanding how you truly feel for me
And yeah, I want you sexually

But I ain't talking 'bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
(Ain't talking bout her), ain't talking 'bout him
(I'm talking 'bout trust), I'm talking 'bout truth
(I'm talking 'bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart) Please take care
(This is my heart) Always be there
(This is my heart) Some things you can't take
(This is my heart) So whatever you do
Please don't break my heart

Some girls are satisfied with cash in hand
And some girls are happy just to have a man
But my heart has my word to never put her in the way of harm
So even though I like your charm

But I ain't talking 'bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
(Ain't talking 'bout her) Ain't talking 'bout him
(I'm talking 'bout trust) I'm talking 'bout truth
(I'm talking  bout me) And what I'm giving you
(This is my heart) So treat it like gold
(This is my heart) Pretend that it's yours
(This is my heart) It's too valuable to bruise
(This is my heart) So whatever you do, don't lose my heart

One night isn't gonna get you no where
There's so much to learn
And what you dedicate to me, you'll get back in return
Now my bedroom game is sick
If that's only the half of it
(I need love) I'm tired of the same
(Gimme love) Before you gimme game

I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
(Ain't talking 'bout her) ain't talking 'bout him
(I'm talking 'bout trust), I'm talking 'bout truth
(I'm talking 'bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart) So before you tell a lie
(This is my heart) Draw me a line
(This is my heart) Remember pain's too rough
(This is my heart) So whatever you do, please don't break my heart
(I ain't talking bout that, ain't talking 'bout her)
(I'm talking 'bout trust), I'm talking 'bout truth
(I'm talking 'bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart) My heart (This is my heart, this is my heart)
