Ohh

I never been who I wanted to be
I never felt completely free
No ones ever had all of me
Or made me feel so beautiful and sexy
Now I'm flyin' like an airplane
Now I'm ridin' on the open range
Now I'm livin' out my destiny
I know the truth
I got it all in you and me

Oh! I'm givin' myself over to you
Body and soul
I'm givin' it over
I'm givin' myself over to you now

Like a brand new day
Now you and I, we're the face of fame
Ain't nobody got nothin' to say, no
And from my feelings
I never have to run away
No more
Because he's here
Holding me tight
Now every day and night
Oh baby
Can't you see?
I don't wanna be without you anymore
You might also like
Oh! I'm givin' myself over to you
Body and soul
I'm givin' it over
I'm givin' myself over to you
Oh! I'm givin' myself over to you
Body and soul
I'm givin' it over
I'm givin' myself over to you

For the first time
I can stand in front of someone
Finally, I can be me
I can just let my love spill over
I can cry, I don't have to lie
I can finally let someone all the way inside
All the way
All the way
All the way
Yeah, ye-yeah

Handing myself over to you
Body and soul
I'm givin' it over
I'm givin' myself over to you
I'm givin' myself over to you
Body and soul
I'm givin' it over
I'm givin' myself over to you
You know it's the right time
I know it's the right night
I know it's the right life
I know you're the right man
I know I'm the right girl
Come on now feel it
You feel it?
I'm ready to give it over to you
(Body and soul, givin' it all)
I'm givin' myself over to you now

Ooh
All the way, all the way
