Hmmm!
Hmm
I, I, I, I've been through some things
Please don't hold that against me
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Even though I, I, I still can feel a sting
No need to second guess me
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
See I, I, I, I, I, I don't mind you
Putting up a little bit of fight, it's alright
But why run from what's gon' hold you tight?
Through any complications, baby, maybe we can start tonight, hey
I saw the dirty look you gave me
Don't care what your ex do
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Ain't no one gon' love you, like I'm gonna love you!
And if you dare, don't dare send me straight to voice mail
Babe, I'm just gon' text you
Hope it ain't no issue, I just gotta let you know
No one gon' love you like I'm gonna love you

Your name's spelled out in every heartbeat
Ain't no one gonna love you
Ain't no one gonna hold you
Show you what I could show you
Oh, but if you should go down
That same road you've been before
You're in reverse, your pain rehearsed
Just brace yourself for the blow
But don't you know that you could just let it go?
