I guess I said some things last night
That usually in the morning light I regret
Like double shots and cigarettes
Said things like "I love you baby" and
"I know I sound crazy but let's just work this out
Yeah, and maybe settle down"

I woke up hung over
But still had to call you
Cause I just realized girl
That maybe it was all true Yeah

I let the whiskey talk
And baby it said too much
I got the feeling now
It didn't say enough
Cause I'm waking up alone
Missing that midnight kiss
I can't promise you forever
All I know is I still want you to come over
And I'm stone cold sober

I can lie about ninety-nine percent of the time
When I've had too much to drink
Yeah I do stupid things
But this time is different
And baby it feels so right
I hope you were listening
To every word I said last night, yeah
