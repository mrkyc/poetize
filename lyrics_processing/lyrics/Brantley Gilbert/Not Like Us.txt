Yeah, every small town's got its boss hog
Big dog steady runnin' the show
Yeah, attitude, tattooed, sleeves rolled up
He's all swoled up and nowhere to go
Everybody's rollin' 'round in 4-wheel drives and jackin' up their trucks
Yeah, they think they livin' it up not like us

We're on another level
These folks 'round here two-steppin' with the devil
I'm callin' y'alls bluff
Y'all drinkin', y'all smokin' it up
Show me what you got boy
I'll show you that you're not like us
Wanna be, yeah, you know you wanna be like us
Wanna be but you never gon' be like us (Be like us)
Not like us

Everybody likes to light it up with your buddies
Get to buzzin' like a neon light
Hit the strip, get it lit man, take another sip
Hit a lick on a Saturday night
Yeah, they closin' down and throwin' down
Until the sun comes up
Yeah, they think they livin' it up man but not like us
