That long gray beard hung down to his chest
Ol' long hair was always a mess
And the laugh on that man, I'll never forget
You could hear him from a mile away
Loved his Pabst Blue Ribbon and his cigarettes
He'd burn one down, light 'er up again
I still see that grin and that ol' H.D
He'd roll it like he stole the thing
You know, I talked to him yesterday
I asked him

How's that steel horse ride on the streets of gold
Does the promised land have any ol' back roads
Ain't a doubt you've done a burnout on a cloud
Knowin' you, you probably laid her down
Have you revved it up while the angels sang
Did God get on ya, did he take your wings
You better have 'em back 'fore I get in
'Cause brother, we're gonna ride again
Alright

They say blood makes you related
But loyalty makes you kin
So when I called that man my brother
Well, I meant what I said
'Cause we were thick as thieves and we were hell on wheels
I can't begin to tell ya how it feels
But I speak for us all, man it hurts like hell
We miss your smilin' face
We'll saddle up again one day
Until then

Man, you're more than a memory, more than a friend
Man, you'll always be family, we'll never forget
Gonna see you again someday
Hell yeah, we're gonna rock that house
When we get through the gates
