You said come just as you are
Skin and bones, smell like a bar
You sure you want me there this way
Ok
I'm on my way
I'll grab this bottle just in case
That I'm too ashamed to pray
I'm bringing this burden to you now
Yeah the prodigal son returns the only way that I know how, the only way that i know how

Gonna drive my steel horses down to the altar, put my hands on the tank and pray
Lord I ain't got much to offer
I ain't trying to die this way
So may this bottle be the body, and this Burden be the blood, if I pour it out will you take my offer
And give me the strength to never pick it up
Here I stand, just as I am

You know most folks don't understand
That I'm talking about pouring out my best friend
Damn
It sounds so sad but that's how it is
And that's why it's gotta end
Lord I've tried it by myself
Forget my pride, I need your help

Whoa

So fill that river full of tears and whiskey, blood I've spilled and the wars I've waged
The thousand love lost heart broke memories, the scars on my heart, and the skin I wearing
And raise me up
A brand new man
So I can face this world just as I am
You said come just as you are
Skin and bones, and broken heart
You kept your word and here I stand
Born again
