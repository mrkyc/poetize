She was crying out my name
Standing in the driveway
Little bare feet wearing her cotton dress in my way
I still see the rain chasing tears down her face
It was back in October when I said it's over and hid
Behind the door
Behind the shame of my conviction
Beside myself
Beside some empty pill prescription
Can hear her screaming now

No baby don't, you making my heart hurt
Don't say those words
Take it back
You know you don't mean that
You swore when I wore your ring
It meant forever
I've got it on baby
How can you say I lost it
Oh, you promised

Started crying while I was sleeping
Waking up and reaching out
To a bed as empty as the heart inside my chest
So I gathered up some pictures
Said I had some things to give her
I let her read a letter
I had written her to give her on the day we tied the knot
I saw the tears
I saw them fall as she read the part of my growing old
I heard her words
I heard her say it'll never work
And hit my knees and cried

No baby don't, you making my heart hurt
Don't say those words
Take it back
You know you don't mean that
You swore when I wore your ring
It meant forever
I've got it on baby
How can you say I lost it
Oh, you promised

We were different people then
Look at all the hateful things we've said
And I'm just as guilty
But girl that's no way to be
Take it easy baby I'm still broken
Memories enough to tear me wide open
When you see me girl you curse my name
Makes me want to say

No, no baby don't
You're making my heart hurt
Don't say those words
Take it back
You know you don't mean that
You know when you wore my ring
We said forever
But you took it off baby
Safe to say we're through
No matter what you do
You know I'll always love you
Well I have to
