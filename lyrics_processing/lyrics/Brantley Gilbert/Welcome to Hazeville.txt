What's goin' on, B?
Colt Ford, we gon' do this thing, brother?
Take it
Yeah

Reverend said, "I'm gon' split Hell wide open"
Never say never, man, there ain't no way of knowin'
Everybody needs a spot to put the world on faith
I know a place and I know the way

Get that homegrown ready, man, that smoke gon' rise
Run the speed limit, never seein' blue lights
Everybody's chillin' where we always high
Hangin' out with Willie on that laid-back vibe
Blowin' smoke
Like fire into a hayfield
(Oh) Welcome to Hazeville
(Oh) I see you risin' from that shine still
(Oh) Welcome to Hazeville

Ah, just some good old boys
And, man, them girls ain't playin'
The way they move, the way they groovin'
Man, it's crazy, I'm just sayin'
Good times need havin'
There's some chances worth takin'
Yeah, you never know
Maybe there's some love needs makin'
