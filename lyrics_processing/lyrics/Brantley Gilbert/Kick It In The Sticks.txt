Welcome to the home of the hillbilly
Yeah, baby
It's a land of barbed wire and moonshine whiskey
Park your car before you get it stuck
Go on, grab you a beer
And get on up in the truck
It's going down tonight
It's all on me
It's BYOB and I got all we need
Yeah, boy, I'm 'bout to show me a city slicker
How to kick it in the sticks with the critters down on

Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows
If it don't you're going broke
So we
We hang out by the bonfire
Just some good all boys having a dang good time
We crank it up (down here)
We get loud (down here)
Throwing down in the dirty, dirty south (down here)
Be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
Jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks
See Brantley Gilbert LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like
So pop a top and drop a tailgate
Yeah, we're cranking up AC/DC, Hank, Skynyrd, and George Strait
Where's the girls?
'Bout to call 'em up
A little southern drawl said, "Hey trouble what's up?
It's going down tonight
Now they're pulling up
We got the jacked up trucks slap covered in mud
Bikini tops and Daisy Duke denim
Hopping out singing 'Outlaw Women' down on

Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows
If it don't you're going broke
So we
We hang out by the bonfire
Just some good all boys having a dang good time
We crank it up (down here)
We get loud (down here)
Throwing down in the dirty, dirty south (down here)
Be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
Jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks

Hey, boy, hit this Mason jar one time
Burned you a little bit, didn't it?
Ever been snipe hunting?
Come on
We'll do a little frog gigging, cow tipping
How 'bout a little skinny dipping, bass fishing
Take it easy on the 'shine
And stay away from other boys' women
That's one damn good way for a man to get it whooped down
These boys are tough down here
Get your ass tore up down here
And be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
Jocks and bikers, they all came
Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows
If it don't you're going broke
So we
We hang out by the bonfire
Just some good all boys having a dang good time
We crank it up (down here)
We get loud (down here)
Throwing down in the dirty, dirty south (down here)
Be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
