I know the stories behind the bruises
When I've been the shoulder
You've been the reason for her tears
And her tellin' you it's over's useless
You keep callin' her phone, drivin' by when I'm not here
She's beggin' me not to lose my temper
Lord, I've tried, but my patience is runnin' thin
The best thing you can do is forget her
'Cause so help me God, if you ever touch that girl again

You cross that line, boy and there ain't no comin' back
I'm a crazy train, son, and you caught up in the tracks
You've got me growlin' like a pit bull, brother
I'm about to lock my jaws
I'm a time bomb tickin' a real live wire
Boy a shot in the dark, I'm a bullet in a  bonfire
I'm a bullet in a bonfire

I know you don't know my story
But I know your's
And you probably should've read a page or two
'Cause if you think you're a badass on a lady
Boy, you oughta see a grown ass man on a punk ass joke like you

You cross that line, boy and there ain't no comin' back
I'm a crazy train, son, and you caught up in the tracks
You've got me growlin' like a pit bull, brother
I'm about to lock my jaws
I'm a time bomb tickin' a real live wire
Boy a shot in the dark, I'm a bullet in a  bonfire
Yeah, I'm a bullet in a bonfire

Now, I'm gonna let you think it's over
But little do you know, the fun is just about to start
'Cause I see you lookin' over your shoulder
And I see you tryin' to act like you don't hear my footsteps in the dark

You cross that line, boy and there ain't no comin' back
I'm a crazy train, son, and you caught up in the tracks
You've got me growlin' like a pit bull, brother
I'm about to lock my jaws
I'm a time bomb tickin' a real live wire
Boy a shot in the dark, I'm a bullet in a  bonfire
Yeah, I'm a bullet in a bonfire
Yeah, I'm a bullet in a bonfire
