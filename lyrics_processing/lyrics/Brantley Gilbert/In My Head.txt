Well, I watched the sun come up on auburn hair across my chest
Couple coffee cups with just a little wine left
I had to smile 'cause you still got that bottle in your hand
Last night's a movie playin' over and over
All in my head
All in my head, baby

We talked for hours, fell in love with everything you said
About our exes, about Jesus in between some sips
You said so sexy, with your lips about an inch away
You wanna kiss me, don't you, whaddaya say
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

You got me thinkin' crazy, this ain't me, I know where it ends
And this has got too good to be true written all over it
I'm takin' this leap of faith, if I go down in flames
We made a memory that won't go away
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

You sleep so pretty up against me in this truck bed
Your little hand's inside of mine, and it's a perfect fit
And I'm in love with you all over me in every way
And I wouldn't be sayin' this if you were awake
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

I'm takin' this leap of faith, if I go down in flames
We made a memory that won't go away
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

When you woke up, I saw you smile when you looked back at me
Said you missed me, I forgot how to breathe
You're in my head
What am I gon' do with you
You're in my head

You got me thinkin' crazy, this ain't me, I know where it ends
And this has got too good to be true written all over it
I'm takin' this leap of faith, if I go down in flames
We made a memory that won't go away
You're in my head
All in my head, baby

You're in my head
