So man you think you want to run whiskey
Roll with me Hoss
You better listen good and clear
And if you got a badge
Or a big mouth brother
You ain't got no business here
Boy this here is a moonshine still
Can't you smell that whiskey burn
This is how the big dogs run
Boy you're riding shotgun
Buckle up, and let's have some fun

Riding 95 down the highway
Sideways, running from all John Law
I got the booze and the boot
Move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw
Duct tape on that license plate
A six gun in the dash
Is thunder in the hood
Heaven from a still
Lighting in a jar
And brother I'm hell on wheels
Said I'm hell on wheels

Just nine more miles until the state line
We're on time and we lost Barney's blues
So you can open your eyes
You done fine
And danger's part of what we do
Now when we make that drop
We're going to pop a top
You got to lesson left to learn
It ain't wine, don't sip it
Make it bubble when ya hit it
Let it burn, baby, burn

Riding 95 down the highway
Sideways, running from all John Law
I got the booze and the boot
Move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw
Duct tape on that license plate
A six gun in the dash
Is thunder in the hood
Heaven from a still
Lighting in a jar
And brother I'm hell on wheels
Said I'm hell on wheels
Riding 95 down the highway
Sideways, running from all John Law
I got the booze and the boot
Move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw
Duct tape on that license plate
A six gun in the dash
Is thunder in the hood
Heaven from a still
Lighting in a jar
And brother I'm hell on wheels
Said I'm hell on wheels

Riding 95 down the highway
