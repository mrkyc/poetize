Junior year you were A's and B's
Right on track, homecomin' queen
But the day we met
You had your heart set on that badboy thing
And your daddy swore I was trouble
So, I snuck you out to cuddle up
Next to me in that middle seat
We'd roll backroads, hold hands, and sing

We were Romeo and Juliet
Breakin' out in a sweat
Makin' out in the bed
Of a beat up truck
Slap covered in mud
You swore I was lyin'
I swore I was stuck
By the bare footprint on a fogged up window
A big ol' heart around our initials
We told all our friends
That it was love
And it was love
At least we thought it was

You had to wait 'til you turned 18
Earned that ring
Hit one knee
Just like we planned
Tried our hand at that old runaway thing
And I didn't know where I was goin'
But I remember your hair was blowin in the wind
I just knew it then
That what we had would never end

We were Bonnie and Clyde
Rollin' 95
Burnin treads on the tires
Barely a dime
Both our names musta gone insane
Thinkin' we'd get somewhere on half a tank
On the side and at the end of our road
With just enough cash to get you home
We believed all we'd ever need was love
And we had love
At least we thought it was

Love at first sight
I remember that first night
What a beautiful girl
But I grew up and now I see
It just wasn't meant to be
I think it was us against the world

We were Romeo and Juliet
Breakin' out in a sweat
Makin' out in the bed
Of a beat up truck
Slap covered in mud
You swore I was lyin'
I swore I was stuck
By the bare footprint on a fogged up window
A big ol' heart around our initials
We told all our friends
That it was love
It was love
At least we thought it was
