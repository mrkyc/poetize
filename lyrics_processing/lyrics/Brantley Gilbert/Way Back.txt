I guess some things never change
It's been a while since I been around
It still feels like goodbye comin' home
To what's left of our hometown
Stopped by and I saw momma, first thing she said
You know your girl's home too
Ain't been in town ten minutes and the grapevine's
All about me and you
'Cause baby we go

Way back
Me and you and this town
We been through it
You could say that
I'm still the same ol' boy in love
With the same ol' flame that got away
And never gave my heart back
Aww, and that same ol' flame burns
Like it was burnin' way back

It's burnin' way back
Got a call from your best friend, Becky
Says you're hangin out at her place
Guess you heard I was home and you wouldn't mind takin'
A ride for old time's sake
Pulled up, lost my breath
How'd you get more beautiful, lemme getcha door
Yeah, that shotgun seat's still yours
Your bare feet up on the dashboard
Girl, you take me

Way back

You could say that
I'm still the same ol' boy in love
With the same ol' flame that got away
And never gave my heart back
Aww, and that same ol' flame burns
Like it was burnin' way back

Way back
Take a left at the Baptist church
Had our first kiss in the back
Cross the tracks, take a right where I kissed you goodbye
Didn't have to be our last
So girl, I came back
When it comes to you and me, girl
You could say that
Goodbye ain't never meant a thing
And we go

Way back
Me and you and this town
We been through it
You could say that
I'm still the same ol' boy in love
With the same ol' flame that got away
And never gave my heart back
Aww, and that same ol' flame burns
Like it was burnin' way back
