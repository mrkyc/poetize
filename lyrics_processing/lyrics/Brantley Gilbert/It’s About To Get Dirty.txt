Weather man says it's gonna rain
Don't worry, girl, it won't change a thing
Yeah, we still got plans tonight
We gonna kick it, that's a given, baby rain or shine
Leave your Sunday best at home
Be the last time you wear what you got on
Bikini top and cut-off jeans
Damn, baby girl, you know you're lookin' mean
She said how we gonna make it through the mud hole
Whatcha think you got swampers on my truck for, ohh

It's about to get dirty in the dirty south
'Bout to show you what it's all about
But don't worry, this rowdy crowd
We ain't scared, we're still throwin' down
We gonna tap that keg, light that fire
We gonna crank that country, pass that shine
So get thirsty
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
It's about to get dirty, yeah

There's just somethin' about a good ol' flood
Watchin' that red clay turn to mud
Sling it up, slap past the doors
Like a new paint job on a 4x4
Girl, you're gonna have a good ol' time
Can't let a little bit of rain change your mind
Let your hair down, kick off them boots
For once in  your life, let yourself cut loose
Go and get muddy from head to toe
Clean it off, skinny dippin' in the swimmin' hole, oh
