It's four in the mornin', dirt road in Georgia
Blue lights in the rearview
Your blue eyes wide open
Like boy, what you tryin' to do
Think that left turn lost 'em
And it's turnin' you on
You're climbin' over the console
So I'm guessin' it's on
Alright, alright
You're lovin' this fast lane life
Don't lie, don't lie
You don't wanna say goodnight

I tried to tell ya I was crazy
Tried to tell ya that I'd lost my mind
Tried to tell ya I was nothin' but trouble, baby
Yeah, but baby, you thought I was lyin'
Now you got yourself a situation
An angel fallin' for a renegade
You can't blame me if you try and never change me
Yeah, I tried to tell ya I was crazy

Middle of the night, I'm outside in your driveway
Baby, let's go
Didn't call or nothin', just showed up
And told you it's time to roll
Gotcha head over heels
Girl, ain't this a trip
It's ride or die for real
You're lovin this bad boy sh-

Now you got yourself a situation
An angel fallin' for a renegade
You can't blame me if you try and never save me
Yeah, I tried to tell ya I was crazy

Alright, alright
You're lovin' this fast lane life
Don't lie, don't lie
You don't wanna say goodnight
Alright, alright
And I think I want this ride
For life, for life
And I'll never say goodbye

I tried to tell ya I was crazy
Tried to tell ya I was outta my mind
Tried to tell ya I was nothin' but trouble, baby
Yeah, but baby you saved my life
Now we got ourselves a situation
An angel runnin' with a renegade
You can't blame me, she never tried to change me
