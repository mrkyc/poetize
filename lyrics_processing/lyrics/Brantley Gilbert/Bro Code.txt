Look atcha, girl
Standin' in my doorway
Rockin' them curls
And them cut-off daisies, man
She called me up
Can I come over, boy
I'm bored to death
And I'm all alone
And

She only drinks when she's lonely
She only gets stoned when you ain't home
And I know bro code and I ain't breakin' it
But bro, you got yourself a situation, bro
You better get your girl home, boy
You better take yourself home, boy
You better tell her you love her, you need her
'Cause if you don't, she's 'bout to be long gone, bro

I opened the door
And she gets to talkin'
Talkin' 'bout he's controllin' me
And tryin to hold me down
It's gettin old, man
She's ready to roll, man
And I don't want to say
I told you so, man
'Cause

Better show that girl a good time
If you don't it's gon' be goodbye
And if you take it for granted
You hand her to another man
It's a matter of time, bro
It's a matter of time

Now, I know it ain't my business
But I gotta insist that
If this was somebody else
Your deal is already finished because
Bro code goes out the window
Just be glad it's me lettin' you know, bro
'Cause
She only drinks when she's  lonely
