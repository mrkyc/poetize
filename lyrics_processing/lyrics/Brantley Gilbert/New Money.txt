Pulled up in that beat up truck 'bout as clean as overtime can get
Yeah, I know it don't look like much 'til she climbs on up in it
Got her Ray Ban shades on, painted blue jeans on, that's my shotgun queen
Way out of my league, don't know what she sees
But I'm her blue collar king

Baby, when we ride, I feel like I'm in a Rolls
The top dropped just so everybody knows
I'm rollin' with a dime, yeah, that's you honey
Yeah, shinin' like new money
Yeah, shinin' like new money
(Oh, let it shine baby)

Pull up at the spot and everybody stops
Now they're startin' to stare
They say, "There ain't no way he got a girl like her
Man, he's gotta be a millionaire"
All them boys in Tom Fords are lined up to the door
They're just tryna buy her a drink
But the jokes on them 'cause I'm drinkin' for free
She's still leavin' with me

Baby, when we ride, I feel like I'm in a Rolls
The top dropped just so everybody knows
I'm rollin' with a dime, yeah, that's you honey
Yeah, shinin' like new money
You're the diamond, I'm the rough
I done hit it big, baby, I'ma live it up
Pocket full of dimes, yeah, that's you honey
Yeah, shinin' like new money
Yeah, shinin' like new money
(Oh, let it shine baby)

Of the finer things I just can't afford"

So I won't hold the door while I hop up in that Ford"

Baby, when we ride, I feel like I'm in a Rolls
The top dropped just so everybody knows
I'm rollin' with a dime, yeah, that's you honey
