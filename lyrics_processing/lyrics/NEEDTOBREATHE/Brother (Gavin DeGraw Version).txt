Ramblers in the wilderness
We can't find what we need
We get a little restless from the searching
Get a little worn down in between
Like a bull chasing the matador
Is the man left to his own schemes
Everybody needs someone beside 'em
Shinin' like a lighthouse from the sea

Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night winds are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home

Face down in the desert now
There's a cage locked around my heart
I found a way to drop the keys where my failures were
Now my hands can't reach that far
I ain't made for rivalry
I could never take the world alone
I know that in my weakness, I am strong
But it's your love that brings me home
You might also like
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night winds are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home

And when you call
And need me near
Sayin', where'd you go?
Brother, I'm right here
And on those days
When the sky begins to fall
You're the blood of my blood
We can get through it all

Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I could be the one you call
When you're feeling low (When you're low)
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night winds are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night winds are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home
Be the one to light the way
