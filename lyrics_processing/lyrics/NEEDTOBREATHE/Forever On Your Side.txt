I won't pretend
That we can control the night
Or what kind of road we're on
Or where we will see the light
But right now I'm talking to ya
I'm looking into your eyes
Right now I'm trying to show ya
That we're gonna be alright

Oh, I don't know
What's around the bend
Oh, all I know
Is that my love
It knows no end

All these pieces, they fall in line
Because I'm forever on your side
Take my hand when you can't see the light
'Cause I'm forever on your side
I will carry you every time
'Cause I'm forever on your side

They'll beat you up
But don't let 'em keep you down
'Cause you're always tough enough
And I'll always be around
You might also like
Oh, I don't know
What's around the bend
Oh, all I know
Is that my love
It knows no end

All these pieces, they fall in line
Because I'm forever on your side
Take my hand when you can't see the light
'Cause I'm forever on your side
I will carry you every time
'Cause I'm forever on your side
Oh, I'm forever on your side

Oh, I can't promise that a day will never come
Where the ground beneath us falls out and you got nowhere to run (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, but you won't be alone when the water starts to rise up (Yeah, yeah)
No, you won't be alone, my darling, when the rains come

Oh, I don't know
What's around the bend (What's around the bend)
Yeah, all I know (Yeah, all I know)
Is that my love
It knows no end
All these pieces, they fall in line
Because I'm forever on your side
Take my hand when you can't see the light
'Cause I'm forever on your side
I will carry you every time
'Cause I'm forever on your side
Oh, I'm forever on your side (Forever, forever)
Oh, I'm forever on your side (Forever, forever)
