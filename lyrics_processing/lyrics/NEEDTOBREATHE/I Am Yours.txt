Sometimes I'm under starlit sky
But I'm feeling more like dirt
How do I forget so fast
Who You are, and what that's worth?
'Cause there's an evidence of You
In every corner of this life
So, why do I still try to prove
That I don't deserve Your time?

'Cause I am Yours
And You will always be mine
It seems like madness, I'm invited
To the table by Your side
'Cause I am Yours
And you will always be mine
I'm a man whose one ambition
Is to dance with my Divine
'Cause I am Yours
And You are, You are, You are
You are mine

Sometimes I'm walking on a ledge
And I am afraid to just look down
It's like I think I'm in control
I'm giving gravity to doubt
But You love me where I am
Enough for You to not look back
And it's the only kind of love
That I have ever felt like that
You might also like
'Cause I am Yours
And You will always be mine
It seems like madness, I'm invited
To the table by Your side
'Cause I am Yours
And You will always be mine
I'm a man whose one ambition
Is to dance with my Divine
'Cause I am Yours
And You are, You are, You are
You are mine

We say no, don't let the rain come
'Cause we got our reservations
But the water that we need
Is bound to overtake us
If I had to write a story
Of the greatest love in time
I would have to sing of You
How I'm this branch and You're the vine
And the romance that we have
Oh, it's easy by design
I was fortunate to find You
I'm still blown away You're mine
'Cause I am Yours
And You will always be mine
It seems like madness, I'm invited
To the table by Your side
'Cause I am Yours
And You will always be mine
I'm a man whose one ambition
Is to dance with my Divine
'Cause I am Yours
And You are, You are, You are
