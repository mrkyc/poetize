You were there to pick me up
And tell me I was good enough
It doesn't matter what I've done
You pull me closer
The highs and lows and in-betweens
You're the one that's there for me
When I hurt and when I bleed
You make it better
You make it better

You will always be
You will always be
The one that I can call
The safest place to fall
For me
When I can't stand
When I can't stand

You always find the best in me
The time is hiding underneath
Every insecurity
That I can't cover
I can leave them at the door
You never need me to be more
Than who I am if I am yours
And I am yours now
I am yours now
You might also like
You will always be
You will always be
The one that I can call
The safest place to fall
For me
You will always be
You will always be
The one that I can call
The safest place to fall
For me
When I can't stand

When you feel a little lost now
Don't remember who you are now
You can run into my arms
You can fall, you can fall on me
I ain't ever gonna leave you
So don't keep another secret
Oh, your tears aren't a weakness
You can fall, you can fall on me
When you feel a little lost now
Don't remember who you are now
You can run into my arms
You can fall, you can fall on me
I ain't ever gonna leave you
So don't keep another secret
Oh, your tears aren't a weakness
You can fall, you can fall on me
You will always be
You will always be
The one that I can call
The safest place to fall
For me
You will always be
You will always be
The one that I can call
The safest place to fall
For me
When I can't stand
