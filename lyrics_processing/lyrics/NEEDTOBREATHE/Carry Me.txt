I chased you into the light
Yeah I stayed there to see myself pure
All the ashes and scars they fail
They pale in comparison to yours
There were footprints the size of the universe
There were fortunes that no one could earn
So I chased you farther still
And I hope that I never return

From the river's mouth
To the mountain peak
Through the great divide and the valley deep
I need you to carry me

Carry me
Carry me, I'm on my way
But I'm in too deep
I need you to carry me

You were calling me, into the deep
Into waters that no map could find
You were calling me
Out beyond my fears
Where my darkness finds rest in your light
You might also likeI found a fortress where I could surrender
Where my shame didn't hide what I lacked
And so I chased you out farther still
Cause I know that I ain't never coming back

From the river's mouth
To the mountain peak
From the great divide and the oceans deep
I need you to carry me

Carry me
Carry me, I'm on my way
But I'm in too deep
I need you to carry me

I found a place where the past was forgiven
Where my mistakes met a grace I couldn't earn
And so I piled up my excuses and defenses in the night
Then I lit a match, stepped back and watched them burn

From the river's mouth
To the mountain peak
Through the great divide where the waters meet
I need you to carry me
Carry me
Carry me, I'm on my way
But I'm in too deep
I need you to carry me
I need you to carry me

From the day I was born to the end of these seas
