My heart is leading and I'm under attack
Don't need a cure 'cause I don't wanna go back
I'm givin' in, there ain't no fighting this fire

I got this fever, fever burning inside
I got this fever, fever getting me high

Let's have a great night on the dance floor
I'll be the cowboy on the white horse
And if we don't drown when we're swimming ashore
I'll be the first in line to get us some more

I got some money burning holes in my pants
And I've been wearing down the bones in my hands
I'm getting off here, yeah, I got me some plans

I got this fever, fever burning inside
I got this fever, fever getting me high

Let's have a great night (Great night) on the dance floor
I'll be the cowboy (Cowboy) on the white horse
And if we don't drown when we're swimming ashore
I'll be the first in line to get us some more

Oh, all the rules need breaking
And I need time for wasting
Before I lose my mind
Oh, tonight, we'll all be outlaws
Take what we want and then ride off
Tonight, we'll feel alive, oh

I got this fever, fever burning inside
I got this fever, fever getting me high
I got this fever, fever burning inside
I got this fever, fever getting me high

Let's have a great night (Great night) on the dance floor
I'll be the cowboy (Cowboy) on the white horse
And if we don't drown when we're swimming ashore
I'll be the first in line to get us some more
Let's have a great night (Great night) on the dance floor
I'll be the cowboy (Cowboy) on the white horse
And if we don't drown when we're swimming ashore
