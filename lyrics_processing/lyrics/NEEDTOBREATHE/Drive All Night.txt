I ain't lookin' for a free ride home
Back to the middle
I need a new locale
I need a girl that calls me baby
I need to know if she can save me
I need somewhere I can drive all night
Out into the darkness
Follow the headlights down
I gotta know where they can take me
I gotta know if they can save me

Who-o-o-oaa
Who-o-o-oaa

Focus in on every word
Change my path
Maybe I could leave a mark
Try and prove the poets wrong
There must be time
Maybe we could be the song
To march us on

I ain't lookin' for a free ride home
Back to the middle
I need a new locale
I need a girl that calls me baby
I need to know if she can save me
I need somewhere I can drive all night
Out into the darkness
Follow the headlights down
I need to know where they can take me
I gotta know if they can save me

Who-o-o-oaa
Who-o-o-oaa

Beg the book to turn the page
'Cause I get stuck where the villains get away
Somewhere in this wretched tale, there must be a line
Where the victim gets his way
Just one time
I'll get mine

I ain't lookin' for a free ride home
Back to the middle
I need a new locale
I need a girl that calls me baby
I gotta know if she can save me
I need somewhere I can drive all night
Out into the darkness
Follow the headlights down
I need to where they can take me
I gotta know if they can save me
Who-o, o-o-o
Drive all night
Yeah, baby just hold on tight
Oh, and you can close your eyes
Yeah, and we can say goodbye
Oh, we can drive all night
Yeah, just hold on tight
Baby, just close your eyes
Yeah, and we can say goodbye
Who-o-o-oaa
Baby we can say goodbye
