Give me your heart, give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify

Into the wild, canyons of youth
Oh, there's a world to fall into
Weightless we'll dance, like kids on the moon
Oh, I will give myself to you
As soon as you start, to let go

Give me your heart, give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify

Wave after wave, as deep calls to deep
Oh, I'll reveal my mystery
As soon as you start, to let go
You might also like
Give me your heart, give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify

Mist on the mountain risin' from the ground
There's no denying beauty makes a sound
We can't escape it, there's no way to doubt
Mist on the mountain rising all around

Give me your heart, give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
You can get lost inside
(You can get lost inside)
You can get lost inside
Let me hear you testify
You can get lost, you can get lost inside
Let me hear you testify
You can get lost, you can get lost inside
