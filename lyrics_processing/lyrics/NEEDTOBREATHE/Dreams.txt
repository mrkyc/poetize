You make dreams come true
You make dreams come true

I'm a wounded shell
I'm a restless hurry
I get a few things right, but still I find myself in trouble
I'm a loaded gun
I'm a full-blown worry
I'm a reckless soldier trying to crawl out of the rubble

It's hard to see the light from under it
But all these failures got me wondering

That's why I throw my bones in the rhythm
Sink my teeth in a good time
Whole lot more than a feeling I could lose
That's why I brace myself every minute
Try to hold on tight for a good ride
Fools like us are only here to prove
You make dreams come true
You make dreams come true

I'm a small town voice
I'm a winding story
I fought my way onto the stage to make a living
And I fell down hard
But the falling saved me
I'm only half the man I was when I was twenty

And it wasn't what we chalked it up to be
When we were kids in Carolina and Tennessee

That's why I throw my bones in the rhythm
Sink my teeth in a good time
Whole lot more than a feeling I could lose
That's why I brace myself every minute
Try to hold on tight for a good ride
Fools like us are only here to prove
You make dreams come true
You make dreams come true

Oh, to my surprise
The broken things in life
Were mistakes that I could use
The gift was giving in
After all I did
It's still the life that I would choose
That's why I throw my bones in the rhythm
Sink my teeth in a good time
Whole lot more than a feeling I could lose (That's why I)
That's why I brace myself every minute
Try to hold on tight for a good ride
Fools like us are only here to prove
You make dreams come true
You make dreams come true
You make dreams come true
(That's why I throw my bones in the rhythm)
(Sink my teeth in a good time)
You make dreams come true
(Whole lot more than a feeling I could lose)

That's why I brace myself every minute
Try to hold on tight for a good ride
