Trading punches with the heart of darkness
Going to blows with your fear incarnate
Never gone until it's stripped away
A part of you has gotta die to change

In the morning you gon' need an answer
Ain't nobody gonna change the standard
It's not enough to just feel the flame
You've gotta burn your old self away

Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, cuz it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, cuz it's a hard love

You know the situation can't be right
And all you ever do is fight
But there's a reason that the road is long
It take some time to make your courage strong
You might also like
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, cuz it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, cuz it's a hard love

When the wolves come and hunt me down
I will face them off and stand my ground
Cuz there's a fire burnin' in me
They will see my strength in this love I found
Oh

Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, cuz it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, cuz it's a hard love

It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
It's a hard love
Hold on tight a little longer
What don't kill ya, makes ya stronger
Get back up, cuz it's a hard love
You can't change without a fallout
It's gon' hurt, but don't you slow down
Get back up, cuz it's a hard love
