Close my eyes and think of you
Go to sleep and dream of you
We don't get to be here long
I gave you the best of me
Loved you more than anything
But we don't get to be here long
We don't get to be here long

And though my heart may be in pieces
My eyes are still set on you
And though I can't keep it together
I know that you want me, too
Oh, I'm swimming in the grief
And there's no anchor that can hold me down
I don't want any relief
'Cause I don't wanna let you go right now

Close my eyes and think of you
Go to sleep and dream of you
We don't get to be here long
(We don't get to, we don't get to be here)
I gave you the best of me
Loved you more than anything
But we don't get to be here long
You might also like
Though your moments were a charity
They gave me more than I could use
I know you found the promised land
But I'm still here and I'm missing you

Close my eyes and think of you
Go to sleep and dream of you
We don't get to be here long
(We don't get to, we don't get to be here)
I gave you the best of me
Loved you more than anything
But we don't get to be here long

When the day comes and the fire is out
I wanna know that I gave you all, I gave you all I had
Yeah, when the day comes and the fire is out
I wanna know that I gave you my everything

Close my eyes and think of you
Go to sleep and dream of you
But we don't get to be here long
(We don't get to, we don't get to be here)
I gave you the best of me
Loved you more than anything
But we don't get to be here long
