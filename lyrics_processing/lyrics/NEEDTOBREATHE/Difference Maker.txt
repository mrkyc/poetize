Yeah, isn't it amazing how a man can find himself alone?
Call into the darkness for an answer that's he's never known
Yeah, isn't it amazing how a God can take a broken man
Yeah, let him find a fortune, let him ruin it with his own two hands?

And he climbs on up the hill
On the rock on which he stands
He looks back at the crowd
And he looks down at his hands and he says
"I am a difference maker"

Oh, I am a difference maker
Oh, I am the only one that speaks to Him
And I am the friendliest of friends of God

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Yeah, isn't it amazing how a man can find himself alone?
Call into the darkness for an answer that's he's never known
Yeah, isn't it amazing how a God can take a broken man
Yeah, let him find a fortune, let him ruin it with his own two hands?

And he walks on up the hill
To the rock on which he stands

And he looks down at his hands and he says
"I am the difference maker"

Oh, I am a difference maker
Oh, I am the only one that speaks to Him
And I am the friendliest of friends of God

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I am on the fence about nearly everything I've seen
And I have felt the fire get put out by too much gasoline
And we're all strangers passing through a place and time, an afternoon
Life is but a vision in a window that we're peeking through
Helpless conversation with a Man who says He cares a lot
It's a passive confrontation about who might throw a punch or not
And we are all transgressors, we're all sinners, we're all astronauts
So if you're beating death then raise your hand, but shut up if you're not
'Cause I am a difference maker
Oh, I am the only one that speaks to Him
And I am the friendliest of friends of God
I am a difference maker
Oh, I am the only one that speaks to Him
And I am the friendliest of friends of God
