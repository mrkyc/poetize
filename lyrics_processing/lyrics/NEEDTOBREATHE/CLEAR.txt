You are the moonlight in the sky that I'm pursuing
You are the reason for what I'm doing
You are the crystalline that keeps me from my ruin
You are the movement
You're the true north pointing back home
You are the constant, my constellation
You're the steady hands of a ticking clock that I'll come to rely on

Oh-oh, it's so clear
Come a little closer
All of my love is right here
I just want to hear you whispering you still trust
You're the only thing that I have ever been sure of
I just wanna be where you are
I promise I won't let you down
Honey, it's so clear now

You are the four winds
You're the catalyst of high hopes
You are the beauty
The sparks revival
You are the oxygen inside these lungs that's giving life to my bones
You might also like
Oh-oh, it's so clear
Come a little closer
All of my love is right here
I just want to hear you whispering you still trust
You're the only thing that I have ever been sure of
I just wanna be where you are
I promise I won't let you down
Honey, it's so clear now

Oh-oh, it's so clear
Come a little closer
All of my love is right here
I just want to hear you whispering you still trust
You're the only thing that I have ever been sure of
I just wanna be where you are
I promise I won't let you down
Honey, it's so clear now

Honey, it's so clear now
It's so clear now
I promise I won't let you down
Honey, it's so clear now
Honey, it's so clear now
Honey, it's so clear now

It feels like heaven is coming down
It's right here with me it's all around
I once was so lost but I am found
When I'm with you
No ones watching the way you move
Your body's dancing under the moon
You always know just what to do

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
