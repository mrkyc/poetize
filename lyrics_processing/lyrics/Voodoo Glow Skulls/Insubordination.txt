Go, go
Let's go

What do you mean, I have a bad attitude?
Don't get me wrong, but my nature is rude
I know when I'm being taken advantage of
People are people, but you make mistakes too
Call my bluff, use your power
Everyone knows you're the man of the hour
Write me up, send me home early
In the end, you're giving me what I'm meant for
Hey, hey, hey

Everyone knows I'm a rebel
Not a troublemaker, can't you tell?
I just speak up for myself
At the same time, I'm losing my dignity
Losing my dignity
Losing my dignity

Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination
Ska, ska, ska
Insubordination

Well, go ahead, make a fool of yourself
Go ahead, write me up, yeah, come on
