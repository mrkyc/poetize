You got that lemonade, but, baby, I ain't buying
Need something hotter to melt the ice
Get you some Gatorade because your mouth is drying
From drooling over me day and night

Can't you hold your horses?
I know you want the cake, but don't skip all the courses

Boy, you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh
Won't get to first ba-a-a-a-ase by begging me
(Da da da da da da)
You wanna play the game?
Give me a little space and, maybe, you'll get a taste
Boy you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh
(Da da da da da da)

T to the H to the I-R-S-T-Y, you thirsty
You thirsty (Da da da da da da)

You want that Bottle Pop, you want that Coca-Cola
But I'm not ready to open up
You want my walls to drop, wanna invite me over
Then I'mma need you to slow that talk
You might also like
Can't you hold your horses?
I know you want the cake, but don't skip all the courses

Boy, you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh
Won't get to first ba-a-a-a-ase by begging me
(Da da da da da da)

Now, I'm not sayin' that you're not my type
All that I'm sayin' is girls never like
Boys who come chasing without any steeze
We don't like them that thirsty
