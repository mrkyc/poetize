Rules, regulations no I don't have patience for them
Go with my gut, don't give a
The truth is my friend

I know I don't need permission to do what I wanna do
You're gonna listen to what I want, what I wanna say
Ain't gonna apologize, I'm not afraid to cry
I'm not afraid to feel

I'm allowed to be fragile
I'm allowed to be broken so long I don't break
I'm allowed to be doubtful
I'm allowed to question the decisions I make
I'm allowed to be loud
I'm allowed be foolish
I'm allowed to be young
That don't mean I'm clueless
I'm allowed to be fragile
I'm allowed to be

Row through the motions, you don't feel emotion like me
Finally realizing my strength
No that don't make me weak
