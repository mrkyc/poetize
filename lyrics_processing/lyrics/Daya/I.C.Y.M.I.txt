Why you, why you gotta be so uncool? (Eh-eh-aye)
I told you I didn't want us to continue (Eh-eh-aye)

But, it's like it went in your ear and came out on the other side
I guess you didn't wanna hear, but, now, it's time for you to get it right

In case you missed it, or just don't get it
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Been calling all night 'cause I won't call back
No, I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you
(Oh-oh, eh-eh-aye)

Easy, I tried to make it easy (Eh-eh-aye)
To leave me, but I guess you don't believe me (Eh-eh-aye)

Running, telling all your friends we're going on another date
Something's missing in your head and, now, it's time for you to get it straight
You might also like
In case you missed it, or just don't get it
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Been calling all night 'cause I won't call back
No, I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you

I don't wanna kiss, I don't wanna talk
Boy, in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
So don't send me a text, don't give me a call
Boy, in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
I-I-I don't wanna kiss, I don't wanna talk
Boy, in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
So don't send me a text, don't give me a call
Boy-boy, in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all

In case you missed it, or just don't get it (What now?)
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Been calling all night 'cause I won't call back
No, I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you
(Oh-oh)
Just in case you missed it
I'm all the way over you, over you
(Oh-oh)
Just in case you missed it
I'm all the way over you, over you, over you
