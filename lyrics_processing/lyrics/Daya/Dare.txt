Dare me to reach a little higher
You can dare me to step over the edge
I dare you to dare me to go play with fire
I'm gonna do everything that you never did
I'll leave my footprints on the water
Bet on the dark horse until I'm a millionaire
And you can all sit back and say that I'm a loser
But I don't worry 'cause the truth is in the dare

So go on: dare me to lose, dare me to move, dare me to run
And you can dare me to prove something to you
Is that what you want?
I dare you to

I dare you to
I dare you to
I dare, I dare, I dare, I dare you to

There was a time I was afraid of
The dark and monsters livin' underneath my bed
And then I said, "Enough is enough," simply because
The only monsters were the voices in my head
You might also like
So go on: dare me to lose, dare me to move, dare me to run
And you can dare me to prove something to you
Is that what you want?
I dare you to

I dare you to
I dare you to
I dare, I dare, I dare, I dare you to

Do it all, do it all, do it all 'cause I wanna
Do it all, do it all, do it all 'cause I'm gonna do everything
Do it all, do it all, do it all 'cause I wanna
Do it all, do it all, do it all 'cause I'm gonna do everything

So go on: dare me to lose, dare me to move, dare me to run
And you can dare me to prove something to you
Is that what you want?
I dare you to

I dare, I dare, I dare, I dare you to
I dare you to
I dare you, I, I dare you
I dare you
I dare, I dare, I dare, I dare you!
I dare you, I dare you
