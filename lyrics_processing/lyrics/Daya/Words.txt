Sorry boy, if I'm not that loud
Doesn't mean I'm out, but a word could ruin it
Sorry boy, gotta slow it down
Betta' shut your mouth, do the talking with your lips

I'm right on the edge
And I know how to swim, but I'm not jumpin' in
Not scared to get wet
But if we dip our feet, I know we'll go too deep

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way, oh way, oh
In the way, oh way, oh way, oh
In the way, in the way, oh way, oh way, oh
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

The words only get in the way
The words only get in the way
You might also like
Like you lots, I just had a thought
We could make it fun, doesn't have to have a name
Everyone, puts the pressure on
But we're not everyone, so we don't have to do the same

I'm right on the edge
And I know how to swim, but I'm not jumpin' in
Not scared to get wet
But if we dip our feet, I know we'll go too deep

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way, oh way, oh
In the way, oh way, oh way, oh
In the way, in the way, oh way, oh way, oh
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

The words only get in the way
The words only get in the way
Don't want a good heart to break (Oh no)
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way, oh way, oh (In the way)
In the way, oh way, oh way, oh (Only get in the way)
In the way, in the way, oh way oh way oh (Only get in the way)
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

The words only get in the way
(Get in the way)
