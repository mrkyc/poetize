Don't let the negative ever get in your way
Don't let it mess up your life, don't let it fuck up your day
Don't let the shit they do get in under your skin
Gotta push it aside and keep pushing ahead

Ooh, when this life knocks you on your ass
Keep up, just keep coming back
Don't let it get you down

Gotta keep going
Keep moving in forward motion
Keep moving in forward motion
Don't let nothing ever slow you down
Keep on, hit the gas, get your speed on
Never look back, no reason
No, no, nothing's gonna stop you now

Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
No, no, nothing's gonna stop you now

Don't let the darkness get in the way of your life
Don't let it mess with your head, don't let it shut off your shine
You're on the fast track there, just stuck in reverse
Leave 'em under your wheels, kick 'em under the curb

Ooh, when this life knocks you on your ass
Get up, just keep coming back
Don't let it keep you down

Gotta keep going
Keep moving in forward motion
Keep moving in forward motion
Don't let nothing ever slow you down
Keep on, hit the gas, get your speed on
Never look back, no reason
No, no, nothing's gonna stop you now

Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
No, no, nothing's gonna stop you now
So any time the drama comes
Don't let it get anywhere near you
Just go and leave it in the dust
Just disappearing in the rearview
You're on a run that's just beginning
Know you got no limits
Oh, so just go with it
Don't let it get you down

Gotta keep going
Gotta keep going
Gotta keep going
Keep moving in forward motion
Keep moving in forward motion (Keep moving in forward)
Don't let nothing ever slow you down
Keep on, hit the gas, get your speed on
Never look back, no reason
No, no, nothing's gonna stop you now
Gotta keep going
Keep moving in forward motion
Keep moving in forward motion (Yeah)
Don't let nothing ever slow you down
Keep on, hit the gas, get your speed on
Never look back, no reason
No, no, nothing's gonna stop you now
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
No, no, nothing's gonna stop you now
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
No, no, nothing's gonna stop you now
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
Stop you now, stop you, stop, stop
