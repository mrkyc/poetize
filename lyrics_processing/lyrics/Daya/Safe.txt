I remember the rush
We were running, backyard to yard
Wasn't scared of going too far
Staying out till it was too dark

Now daylight don't make it right
And you would really know this
Closed hearts make closed minds
I won't tell you it's all butterflies and roses
When I back in time

When we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
There's not much comfort in this place
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha, I'll keep you safe
When you can't fight the bitter taste
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha, I'll keep you safe

Don't remember it all
But I know that I was invincible
Like the heroes in the cartoons
Saving lives through my living room
You might also like
Now daylight don't make it right
And you would really know this
Closed hearts make closed minds
I won't tell you it's all butterflies and roses
When I back in time

When we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
There's not much comfort in this place
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha, I'll keep you safe
When you can't fight the bitter taste
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha, I'll keep you safe

I know that I'm a fighter
Yeah, I've always been a fighter
But I tried to play with fire, and I got burned
Don't know how to help this
Yeah, I'm feeling kind of helpless
Yeah, maybe it's too selfish if it don't wanna hurt
I know that I'm a fighter
Yeah, always been a fighter
But I tried to play with fire and I got burned
Don't know how to help this
Yeah, I'm feelin' kinda of helpless
Yeah, maybe you so selfish if it don't wanna hurt
I know that I'm a fighter, yeah, I've always been a fighter
But I tried to play with fire, and I got burned
Don't know how to help this, yeah, I'm feelin' kinda helpless
Yeah, maybe it's too selfish if I don't wanna hurt
There's not much comfort in this place
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha, I'll keep you safe
When you can't fight the bitter taste
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha, I'll keep you safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
