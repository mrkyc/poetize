When you walk past that park near your apartment now
Do you think about me? Do you think about me?
Do you drive fast when you realize you're on my street?
Do you drive slowly? Do you think about me?

Thought I could pack up my suitcase and just walk away
Walk away (Walk away)
Leave you with all of the shit I didn't wanna take
My mistake (My mistake)

I'm missin' you, I'm missin' you
What the hell did I do, did I do?
Messin' with someone new, thinkin' I wanted to
Turns out I don't want new, I want you
I'm missin' you, I'm missin' you
What the hell did I do, did I do?
Messin' with someone new, thinkin' I wanted to
Turns out I don't want new, I want you

Don't want new, I want you
Don't want new, I want you

When it's 3 AM and I'm at that diner with his friends
I ain't thinkin' 'bout them, I'm just thinkin' 'bout you

Thought I could pack up my suitcase and just walk away

Don't want new, I want you
Thought I'd be better without you
I can't stop thinkin' about you
Now I'm with someone new (I want you)
Thought I'd be better without you
I can't stop thinkin' about you
Now I'm with someone new (I want you)

I'm missin' you, I'm missin' you
What the hell did I do, did I do?
Messin' with someone new, thinkin' I wanted to
Turns out I don't want new, I want you
