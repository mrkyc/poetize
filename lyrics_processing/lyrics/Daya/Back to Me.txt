You only called me your baby
When she wasn't there
Now you go calling me crazy
Because I don't care

We'll never turn back time
Now lovin' you is an afterthought
Too late to press rewind
When all I wanna do, do is stop

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'll never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
When I don't let you do me like that
Can't keep pullin' you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pullin' you back to me
Me, me, me, me

I'll never trust you after
The things that I saw
Who wants an ever after
If it ain't forever at all?

We'll never turn back time
Now lovin' you is an afterthought
Too late to press rewind
When all I wanna do, do is stop

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'll never be enough
Breakin' the best part of me
When I don't let you do me like that
Can't keep pullin' you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pullin' you back to me
Me, me, me, me

You'll never be the one, 'cause it's not how it's supposed to be
Won't pull you back, pull you back, pull you back to me
I don't want your love, baby, we were never meant to be
It's not enough, so you're gonna have to break free
You'll never be the one, 'cause it's not how it's supposed to be
Won't pull you back, pull you back, pull you back to me
I don't want your love, baby, we were never meant to be
It's not enough, so you're gonna have to break free
I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'll never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
When I don't let you do me like that
Can't keep pullin' you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pullin' you back to me
Me, me, me, me

You only called me your baby
