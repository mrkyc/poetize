Stay out late night, running red lights
That's the air we like to breathe
Breakin' your ties, crossing your lines
Leapin' over boundaries
There's never been a mold that you could fit us in
(No, no, no, no)
Doin' what we're born to do is not a sin
(No, no, no, no)

'Cause we are gonna be, we are gonna be who we are (we are)
We don't really care, we don't really care what you want (you want)
Never put a we, never put a we in the box (the box)
Gotta let it go 'cause I'm tellin' you we won't stop (won't stop)

Because we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do
'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
You might also like
You know who we are
You know who we are

Make our own rules, stickin' like fools
Ready to call the police
We can skip school 'cause we're too cool
To be told we can't be free
You can go ahead and try to knock us out
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no keepin' us from doing what we love (we love)
'Cause we love it too much

We are gonna be, we are gonna be who we are (we are)
Gotta let it go 'cause I'm telling you we won't stop, won't stop (won't stop)

Because we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do 'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
You know who we are
You know who we are

We don't hear what you're saying
Being us is okay
We don't hear what you're saying
Being us is okay

(We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are)

We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do 'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are

Ye-eah-e-eah-e-eah, you know who we are
You know who we are
You know who we are
You know who we are
