I run from everyone and I tell lies
You run your fingers through my hair and smile
'Cause nobody believes that this is right
But we're so right, yeah

I hear rumors, let them fly, it's you and me
And they don't have to know
Oh, they don't have to know
Oh, they speculate, but let's just make them wait
'Cause they don't need to know
Nobody needs to know

Under the street lights, nobody knows our names
Tracing the tree lines and shadows around your face
Falling asleep and waking up with the stars
It's our little secret, we're keeping it in the dark

We stumble like the thunder in our hearts
Laying low, we'll never lay apart
Don't wanna let them change the way we are
The way we are, no

Nobody needs to know

Under the street lights, nobody knows our names
Tracing the tree lines and shadows around your face
Falling asleep and waking up with the stars
It's our little secret, we're keeping it in the dark
