(Credit, credit)

I'm gonna make mistakes, maybe twice in the same day
I'm gonna wear my hair up or down
'Cause I don't care what you say, what you say
I promise you that I'm okay, I'm okay
You can call me nice, but I'm not gonna listen
You're wide awake, but I'm better off living
In a dream, in a dream
'Cause that is not reality, -ality

No, I'm not gonna let me down
No, I'm not gonna let me down
And you're not gonna talk me out
No, you're not gonna talk me out
I know that you come around
Yeah, I know that you come around
When I finally get it, when I finally get it
I'm taking the credit

I'm a big girl now, I can handle the bruises
I get lost and found, without any excuses
No apologies, never gettin' one from me
If anybody asks me why, I'll just tell them it's my life

No, I'm not gonna let me down
No, I'm not gonna let me down
And you're not gonna talk me out
No, you're not gonna talk me out

Finally get it, finally get it, won't let you forget it
Finally get it, finally get it, I know you'll regret it
Finally get it, finally get it, won't let you forget it
Finally get it, finally get it, I'm taking the credit
