You got the touch, you got the magic
Making me blush, keeping me coming back for more
Gave you too much, I'll let you have it
It's gonna suck, this is a thing I can't ignore

You almost take me
But you never take me all the way
(All the way, ooh no, no, no)
And I would hate to break your heart
But, I don't wanna waste anymore time on you

I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie (ie-ie-ie, ie-ie-ie)
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife (i-i-ife, i-i-ife)
I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie (ie-ie-ie, ie-ie-ie)
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife (i-i-ife, i-i-ife)

Baby, don't beg, don't buy me flowers
Not gonna stay 'cause it would only make it worse
Some other chick who's kiss on your lips for hours
Sure, it could wait, but I don't wanna see you hurt

You almost took me
But you never took me all the way
(All the way, ooh no, no, no)
And I would hate to break your heart
But, I don't wanna waste anymore time on you
You might also like
I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie (ie-ie-ie, ie-ie-ie)
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife (i-i-ife, i-i-ife)
I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie (ie-ie-ie, ie-ie-ie)
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife (i-i-ife, i-i-ife)

I really like you, but you're not that right for me
I rather wait all my life to find the one
I really like you, but it's just not meant to be
Oh, I'm so sorry, I am, oh yeah

I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie (ie-ie-ie, ie-ie-ie)
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife (i-i-ife, i-i-ife)
I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie (ie-ie-ie, ie-ie-ie)
