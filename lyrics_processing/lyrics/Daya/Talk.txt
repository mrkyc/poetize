I'm not the plain and simple, I'm in another lane
I'm rocking Shirley Temple, the cherry on the cake
Just a throwback kid from the nineties
I start my ABC's with the YZ
I paint with different colors and never in the lines
There isn't any other, I am the prototype
Tick-tock, waste time with your rumors
But, I'm so ice cold, good humor

They say, "I'm outta my mind standin' on the outside"
But, it's cooler, it's fresher
I like it here... (Hey!)

They're all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare, look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em somthin', a little somethin' (ah)
A little somethin' to talk about
Give 'em somethin', a little somethin' (ah)
A little somethin' to talk about

I don't believe in Yeezus, I like 'em Kanye West
I'm rockin' dirty sneakers with my designer dress
Order a Grade-A steak with no pomfret
I wake you up, Starbucks, sleep on me

They're all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare, look at me
Might as well give 'em something

Give 'em somethin', a little somethin' (ah)
A little somethin' to talk about
Give 'em somethin', a little somethin' (ah)
A little somethin' to talk about

No, you don't know what
What you talkin' 'bout
No, you don't know me
So just shut your mouth
No, you don't know what
What your talkin' 'bout
No, you don't know me
So just shut your...
