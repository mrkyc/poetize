Do you drive fast?
When you realize you're on my street
Do you drive slowly?

Thought I could pack up my suitcase and just walk away, walk away (walk away)
Leave you with all the shit I didn't want to take, my mistake
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
What the hell did I do? (did I do?)
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out I don't want new, I want you
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
What the hell did I do? (did I do?)
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out I don't want new, I want you
Thought I'd be better without you
I can't stop thinking about you
Now I'm with someone you (don't want new, I want you)

I'm in his bed, right next to him
But he don't know

When it's 3 AM, and I'm at that diner with his friends
I ain't thinking 'bout them
I'm just thinking 'bout you
Thought I could pack up my suitcase and just walk away, walk away (walk away)
Leave you with all the shit I didn't want to take, want to take
I'm missing you, I'm missing you
