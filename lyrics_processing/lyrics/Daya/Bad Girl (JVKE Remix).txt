Alive in the dark and we ride forever
Feeling so high, going down together (Down)
Free shots at the bar from the guy in leather
Cheers to the night that we won't remember now (Now)

Nothing you could do or say is right
I already know just what I like

Bad girl, need a bad girl, need a bad girl
'Cause the bad boys just don't cut it
We got what they want-want, what they want-want
They can look but they just can't touch it
Bad girl, need a bad girl, need a bad girl
'Cause the bad boys just don't cut it
We're always up to no good
Doing what they wish they could

Do it like this all around the clock
Got boys lining up all around the block, uh-huh, huh
Lighting up flares in the parking lot
If we're gonna live, give it all we got, uh-huh, uh
