Stuck between the wrong and the right thing
Can't make up my mind, it's got a mind of its own
Felt a spark, but there was no lightning
Could've walked away, but still I'm coming back for more

Oh, I am loving your butterfly kisses
But it's like something is missing
Gonna save quittin' you for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No, it's not for life, but it's alright right now
Right now, I got the feeling right now
It's alright right now

Stuck between the green and the red light
Can't make up my mind, should I stop or should I go?
Find it hard to leave after midnight
Using the excuse that it's too late to walk me home
You might also like
Oh, I am loving your summertime kisses
But it's like something's still missing
Gonna save quittin' you for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No, it's not for life, but it's alright right now
Right now, I got the feeling it's alright right now
It's alright right now

I got the feeling, got the feeling
I got the feeling, got the feeling
I got the feeling, got the feeling, whoa oh
Oh, I am loving your butterfly kisses
But it's like something is missing
Gonna save quittin' you for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No, it's not for life, but it's alright right now
Right now, I got this feeling, right now
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like this feeling
