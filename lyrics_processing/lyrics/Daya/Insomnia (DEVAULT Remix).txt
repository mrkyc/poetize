Ahhh

I've been down for two days
Tylenol PM ain't working
Losing track of time, babe (Insomnia)
My mind is running too fast
Shadows on the wall keep lurking
I wish that you would come back (Insomnia)

I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Baby, it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossin' and turnin', tossin' and turnin'
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
I got, I got, I got
I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Baby, it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossin' and turnin', tossin' and turnin'
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
I got, I got, I got
I got, I got, I got
I got, I got, I got
I got, I got, I got
I got, I got, I got
You might also like
I can hear your voice now
Keeping me awake 'til morning
Can see you with the lights out (Insomnia)

I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Maybe it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossin' and turnin', tossin' and turnin'
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
Oh, I got, I got, I got (I got, I got, I got)
I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Maybe it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossin' and turnin', tossin' and turnin'
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
Oh, I got, I got, I got (I got, I got, I got)
I got, I got, I got
I got, I got, I got
I got, I got, I got
I got, I got, I got
I got, I got, I got
'Cause I can't
'Cause I can't
'Cause I can't
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
'Cause I can't
'Cause I can't
'Cause I can't
Without you
Without you
Without you
