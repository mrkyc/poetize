What did I do to break this?
What did I say? Erase it
Staring at the space you left, my bed, my head
How many times can we start again?
What can I do to save this?

One step too far
Don't know where we are
Did I push us too hard?

What if I told you I don't want to live without you?
Every high, every low, it was only for you
I need you to stay, tell me, what can I do?
I would do it for you, I would do it for you
What if I told you, I don't want to be without you?
Would it change anything if you knew what I knew?
I need you to stay, tell me, what can I do?
I would do it for you, I would do it for you

I would do it for you, ooh, you, ooh
I would do it for you, ooh, you, ooh
You might also like
Saw you last night in my dream
Next to someone, happy
Maybe she would treat you better than I did
Maybe I would change if you let me in
'Til you come back, I won't sleep

One step too far
Don't know where we are
Did I push us too hard?

What if I told you I don't want to live without you?
Every high, every low, it was only for you
I need you to stay, tell me, what can I do?
I would do it for you, I would do it for you
What if I told you, I don't want to be without you?
Would it change anything if you knew what I knew?
I need you to stay, tell me, what can I do?
I would do it for you, I would do it for you

I would do it for you, ooh, you, ooh (I would do it for you)
I would do it for you, ooh, you, ooh (I would do it for you)
