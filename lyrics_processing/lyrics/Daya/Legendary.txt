Oh, I don't wanna try it
Cause I'm scared that I'm gonna like it
And I can look but I'm not gonna buy it
Cause my heart, heart is on a diet

But you give off something so cool (you do, you do)
So I guess I'm bendin' my rules (for you, for you)

Let's pretend that it's a holiday-ay-ay
Boy, you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss, I'm gonna blow away-ay-ay
Like a valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today
So why not make it legendary?

No, you can't get a witness
To testify about all of the kisses
When it's gone, you know you're gonna miss this
At least you'll check, check me off your wishlist

Yeah, I give off something so cool (I do, I do)
And I'll give a little to you (to you, to you)

Let's pretend that it's a holiday-ay-ay
Boy, you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss, I'm gonna blow away-ay-ay
Like a valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today
So why not make it legendary?

Hurry up, before you're out of time
(So come on, boy, hurry up)
Better do it before I change my mind
(Before I don't give a what)
Hurry up before you're out of time
(So come on, boy, hurry up)
Better do it before I change my mind
(Before I don't give a what, give a what)

Come, come on, boy, hurry up
