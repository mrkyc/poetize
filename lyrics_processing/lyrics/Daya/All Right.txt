What you talking about?
Bite your lips, shut your mouth and just let go
You've got a cup full of doubt
Come on and empty it out and just say "no"

I know where you're headed
And trust me, you don't wanna go
I've been there before, so, so I would know
Got to take the highs with the lows, the X's with the O's
I've been there before and you're not alone

Even if it's not alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright
Even if it's not alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright tonight

We dream of glitter and gold
But that can get pretty old, it's just oh well
So maybe I don't have much
But I've got someone to love, and that's myself

Don't know where I'm headed
But I've still got somewhere to go
End is not the end, so, so I've been told
Gotta take the highs with the lows, the X's with the O's
We've all been there before and we're not alone

Even if it's not alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright
Even if it's not alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright tonight

Sometimes I feel broke
But it's all alright, yeah, it's gonna be all alright
Sometimes I'm zero
But it's all alright, gonna be alright tonight

Even if it's not all alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright
Even if it's not all alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright tonight

(Even then, be the light, light, even then, we'll be alright)
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright
(Be the night, it's the light, the night)
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright
