Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over, over
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head

You see the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad-veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you
More than she loves you

I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over, over
You might also like
I know it's over
It never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And she even spoke to me and said, oh
"Well if you're so funny
Why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you are so clever
Why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you're so very entertaining
Why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you're so very good looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?"
I know: because tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they are in each other's arms

It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, it's over, it's over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you my love, not tonight my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head

That's about it, let's go home
