And jump the hedges first
And I will drink the clear
Clean water for to quench my thirst
And I shall watch the ferry-boats
And they'll get high, high, high
On a bluer ocean
Against tomorrow's sky
And I will never ever grow so old again
And we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
Oh, sweet thing, sweet thing
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing
And I will drive my chariot
Down your streets and cry
Hey, it's me, i'm dynamite
And I don't know why
And you will hold me strongly
In your arms again
Pretty babe, I will not remember
That I ever felt the pain
And we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
And I will never, ever
Grow so old again
Oh, sweet thing
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing
Sweet thing
You might also likeAnd I will raise my hand up into the midnight sky
And count all the lights that shining up in your eye
Just to dig it all and not to question, well that's just fine
Just to dig it all and never wonder, well that's just fine
And I'll be satisfied not to read between the lines
And we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
You know we will, some day
We, you and me, will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
Oh, you and me, we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
We will walk in gardens all misty wet with rain
And we shall walk in gardens all misty wet with rain
We shall walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
And we will never ever grow so old again
Oh, sweet thing
Oh, sweet thing
Sweet thing, you know we will
Oh, you know we will
Remember the day that I held your hand
And the look in my eyes only you can understand
Remember when we held each other soft and low
And nothing can ever be that strong
Sleep tonight with dreams of sweetest angels' wings
And all your dreams will bring you sweeter things
Sweet, sweet, sweet thing
Oh, sweet thing, don't you know
Come here, let me tell you how much I love you
Sweet thing, oh, sweet thing
You know we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
And we will never grow so old again
