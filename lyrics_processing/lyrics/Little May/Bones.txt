There was this boy I fell apart to
In the backseat of my car to
And I would listen while he laughed about the things
That kept us out of bounds too

There was this boy I fell apart to
In the backseat of my car to
And I would listen while he laughed about the things
That kept us out of bounds too

And there was this girl that made the distance
And she cracked her wrists while you were listening
Yes, she felt the fire, she felt it, she felt it
Deep within your stomach

Do you feel it in your bones like I do?
Do you feel it in your bones like I do?
Do you feel it in your bones like I do?
Do you feel it in your bones like I do?
