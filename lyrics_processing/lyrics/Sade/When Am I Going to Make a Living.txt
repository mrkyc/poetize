When am I gonna make a livin'?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussin' and thievin'
While the sharks are wheelin' and dealin'
Gotta wake up and tell yourself
There's no end to what you can do (What you do is up to you)
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
This is the time (Ah)
To start believin' in yourself (Ooh, ooh)
Put the blame on no one else

When am I gonna make a livin', livin'?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in
See the people fussin' and stealin'
Too many lies, no one is achievin'
Haven't I told you before?
We're hungry for a life we can't afford
There's no end (No end) to what you can do (Ooh, ooh)
If you give yourself a chance to prove

We are hungry, but we won't give in
Hungry, but we won't give in
Hungry, but we won't give in
Hungry, but we won't give in
Hungry, but we won't give in
We're hungry, but we won't give in
Hungry, but we won't give in
Hungry, but we won't give in

Oh, there's no end to what you can do
They'll waste your body and soul if you allow them to
Oh, start believin' in yourself
Put the blame on no one else

Not gonna give in
Hungry, but we won't give in

When am I gonna make a livin'?
Ooh, it's gonna take a while before I give in, yes, it is
I'm sick and tired of scratchin' a livin'
I am hungry, but I'm not gonna give in, no

Hungry, but we won't give in (Not gonna give in)
Hungry, but we won't give in (Ooh, ooh)
Hungry, but we won't give in
Hungry, but we're gonna win
Hungry, but we won't give in (Not gonna give in)
Hungry, but we won't give in (Ooh, ooh)
Hungry, but we won't give in
