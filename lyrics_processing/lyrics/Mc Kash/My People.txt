Yo we trying to survive with our backs to the wall
Through the cracks of our home we see tracks of a war
Ain't nobody else but us, we got just us to trust
Paint a picture where we add up like bristles of a brush
Might be lost, but we one in this world full of greed
Ain't a victim we survivors of war crimes for years
Faith in our tears its something that is evident
We sacrifice with pride take our history as evidence
No element of doubt in the power of a sentiment
The streets are a testament to thoughts that are prevalent
A tyrant's always arrogant but truth is so elegant
It over powers tyranny and victory is imminent
Our history is written with our blood and our dreams
So our past is the answer to the future of our seeds
No more slavery freedom to be equal
Rise in the streets for a reason my people

We equal my people
For freedom my people
Be equal my people
In freedom my people

Now some of us are lost and, shepherds don't come easy
We seen all the hate to never give up on the Dream B
So carry on believing in the fate that is written
And the people who be sleeping will be risen by their children
Future we be building has blood for em bricks
And a vision where we live as close as a fist
No hate for the weak and no blame on the rich
With no slave and no master no chains and no whips
Bleeding in the streets but never on our knees
Cause this struggle is the only road that takes us through to peace
Sedated by our faith so our wounds don't hurt
Freedom is the remedy if slavery is a curse
Same old dream passed to us at our birth
Live free or die what's your worth on this earth?
If you don't fight .. for your freedom .. be equal
Rise in the streets for a reason .. my people

We equal my people
For freedom my people
Be equal my people
In freedom my people

You create something beautiful .. from your pain
And your sorrow, knowing that you fighting for tomorrow
And the Cause of your people will act like your shadow
That will walk right with you on a path that is narrow
And the Pharoah's of this world will put you on the Gallows
Or tie you at the stake so you could die like an echo
But men die ... ideas don't ...
I said: MEN DIE, IDEAS DON'T

We equal my people
For freedom my people
Be equal my people
