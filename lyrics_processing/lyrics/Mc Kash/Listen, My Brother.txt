I got truth for your ears ya need to hear, my brother
Understand the very reason why we here, my brother
Got our people up in jails do you care, my brother?
When every new born child is made a slave, my brother?
Why you selling your soul for some gold, my brother?
Why you ready to give up what you hold, my brother?
Can't you see what we lost in these years, my brother?
Is you blind to our mother shedding tears, my brother?
Why you living a lie while we die, my brother?
Why you hating on those who try, my brother?
Every sacrifice cries for the cause, my brother
It's time to unify our thoughts, my brother!
Verse II (MC Kash):
We need to shed our differences and unite, my brother
We need to rise together so we can fight, my brother
'cause the key of revolution is in your hands, my brother
You need to unlock your dreams and demand, my brother
If it's hate or envy turn around, my brother
We all suffered the same in this town, my brother
And no matter who you be we are one, my brother
No more slavery we are done, my brother
You might also likeLet this world bear witness to your heart, my brother
You keep searching for some light when its dark, my brother
You taught me we was equal and every man's my brother
We will fight till we free that's the plan my brother!
Verse III (MC Kash):
I have seen the dream in your eyes, my brother
And that fire that would burn down their lies, my brother
I have seen you stand up to their hate, my brother
Seen the epitaph written on your grave, my brother ...
And I hope that we take what you left, my brother
You should know that I'll follow your every step, my brother
And I mean every word in this song, my brother
