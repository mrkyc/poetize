Verse I:
You selling peace? you stupid? in a land that's still disputed
Your vision's all polluted if you can't see the persecuted
We got dreams I assure you and the truth's right before you
But you blind cause you blind mayn, and I ain't the one to cure you
My symphony is truth my instrument is pain
My struggle is so righteous you will hide your act in shame
And i am but a dreamer who wants freedom for his people
You a nazi up in auchwitz siding with the evil
If that money's so important why they made it out of paper
Why they made it out of paper won't you die for something greater
Or live to fight for people who still sacrifice for justice
Who been bleeding all these years left to die behind them curtains
And I would rather eulogize all my fallen brothers
Than shake some sense in those who got no soul just some orders
Or hide up in some quarters think that everybody's waiting
War criminals is your crowd now you know why we hating

This is war this is war
In my streets there's a war there's no peace there is war
There is war there is war

Verse II:
Can you picture these rhyme schemes, broken bones and body bags
Cul de sac they got you trapped a man will die but he won't be last
You got a chance if you don't react, swing your baton save your ass
Go back home and pack your bags you not allowed to sell your trash
We all know what we gotta do, to fight, and to carry on
It's true that we hard to woo, so hear this word and pass it on
Pass this song and make your move, raid my studio if you can
Ive a plan i stand and fight there's no such thing as backing down
I know my needs I bleeds for truth like maqbool bhat the martyr
Cause chasing freedom fed my hunger and my will got stronger
Got older shouldered coffins walked straight into a slaughter
Been dodging bullets all my life now I'm standing taller
Answers blowing in the wind a hurricane is coming
You tangled up in blue and the jokerman's running
On Highway 61 everybody's getting stoned
So pack your bags and leave we be burning down the throne
Hook:
Is this peace that you talk? that you sell? this is war
This is war this is war
In my streets there's a war there's no peace there is war
There is war there is war

Bridge:
You selling peace we ain't buying it
