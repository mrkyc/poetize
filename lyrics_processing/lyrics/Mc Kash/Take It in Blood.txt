Verse 1:
Life Goes on like a clock, but a never endin'
Pain won't stop
I stand in rain and feel no drop, I feel my
Legs that fail to walk
"All you have to do is talk", I'm just a man
And not a rock
I close my eyes its time to knock take my
Breath and take my spot
She hugs me like that son she lost in the
Course of a holocaust
I swear to God, I tell no lies even tears had
Died in her eyes
Makes me wonder what it takes, to love
When you seen so much hate
To be so strong when you been so down
For a mother who lost her crown
Nine months in the womb he stayed
Twisted and turned while she prayed
Sixteen years of a blissful game, till that
Night A monster came
Held a gun and grabbed a knife, took the
Kid from the lap of Life
She holds his picture, Takes a sigh, why
Every human has to lie?
Now put some fear in your heart if you
Can't hear her calls
If you there in your prison you should tear
Down the walls
Meet a man you tell him this there's a
Woman in the mist
Who sleeps in tears and makes a wish, If
There is a grave that she could kiss

Verse 2:
She speaks in words that I can't quote
Feels like a razor in my throat
"ask some questions don't be shy" I hold
My tears and testify
To her struggle when it shows justice was
Not found in courts
A picture's nuff to justify her struggle will
Never die
I cross my heart and take a vow, to make
Her pain my own somehow
To let her know she has a son, who sees
And hears and has a tounge
So never think that you alone, its your
Crown and its yo throne
You fought for every seed unborn, stood
Your ground in a raging storm
Materialistic people came gave a speech
And made their name
But her will took birth from a tear
Courage, patience, persevere
Fight till death and never fear twenty years
She made it clear
Once every month in a park, she tells her
Story from the start
And her heart is left to bleed, a million
People in the streets
Who pay no heed to her cries, who move
Along and live their li(v)es
Will you stop and tell her this You my
Mother in the mist
Who sleeps in tears and makes a wish, If
There is a Son that she could kiss
