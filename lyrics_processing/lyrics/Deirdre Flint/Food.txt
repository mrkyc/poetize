Get ready
And the way you look and the way you smell it makes a girl
Go heady
Now you're spread out on the table, mmmm, what a thrill
I'm gonna go at you 'till I've had my fill
Love inspires love songs, and I've penned one or two
Here's one for you, baby, and it's long overdue
This is a song for you, food
You're hot, you're cold, you're always in the mood
So glad to see me you don't cop an attitude
You know what I like - food
Food, I am so sorry that I never deigned to thank you for all that you've been
It's been you when I'm sad, you when I'm lonely
It's been you through thick and through thin
And when my heart broke so bad that I thought I should have died
You took the saving form of something deep-fried
And when I was a pimpled loser, back in seventh grade
All my friends abandoned me, but you stayed
This is a song for you, food
You're spicy, sweet, you're always in the mood
So glad to see me you don't cop an attitude
You're so good going down - food

Those ladies on their StairMasters and stationary bikes
Well it looks to me like they're all on some sort of hunger strike
It's a tragic ticking time bomb, you know one's gonna go nuts
A hostage situation, binging at a Dunkin' Donuts
But it's okay, it's just a phase, they'll be back for sure
'Cause I myself have tried to leave you, so many times before
I've tried Deal-A-Meal, Nutraslim, Cabbage Soup, fen-phen
High carb, no carb, all carb, low carb
Atkins diet, yeah I've tried it
Kathy Smith, Nordic track, tai bo, Ex Lax
Hypnosis, Ritalin, Herbalife, Dexatrim
Weight Watchers, SlimFast, purge yourself skinny

I've been so unfaithful, but you always took me in
Food, I'm going back to you and I ain't never go away again
Food, fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-food
Just four things keep me from being thinner
Breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner
But I'll be just fine in a nuclear winter
Kate Moss will die
And if we're in a plane crash and might have to eat each other
You'll look at my thighs and your heart will start to flutter
They've been crafted for years by pancakes and butter
Mmm mmm mmm
I love ya Twinkie! I love ya pot pie!
Strudel, man you rock!
Fondue, what can I say? You're food on a stick
You're dipped in chocolate or cheese
No human being on earth can give me that kind of pleasure. None
