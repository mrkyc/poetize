My best friend lived two blocks away
And from when we met, I guess you could say
We never were apart
My whole world there on her lawn
We grew closer as the years wore on
And wore cheap tin lockets from Taiwan
Two halves of a matching heart
Late bloomers who didn't give a damn
We played jacks and rope and kick the can
While the other girls had left them long ago
Well my thirteenth summer things got strange
She went to camp she came home changed
She had put aside those childish ways
Into things I didn't know
And a new friend from camp lived out this way
She'd be there when I would come to play
And a girl knows when she's in the way
But I couldn't let it go
And I prayed, Please God, please
Let that new girl move or get some weird disease
I just want things back the way they used to be
Two's sublime and three's a crowd
Looks like I am the odd one out
Oh please bring Caroline back to me

No best friend with me at my side
And those halls they ache a mile wide
When you're walking them alone
And I had other friends it's true
But they couldn't hold a candle to
The Caroline that I once knew
And it cut me to the bone
I called one night to say Love Boat's on
Why don't you come here what did I do wrong?
She mumbled some excuse
And hung up the phone
And I prayed, Please God, please
I don't ask for much I have simple needs
I just want things back the way they used to be
Two's sublime and three's a crowd
Looks like I am the odd one out
Oh please bring Caroline back to me
Well I've always been the best-friend type
It takes one good friend to fill my life
And I know there's those who'd be surprised
To think of me that way
Cause it's two years here and I'm history
Every farewell party's thrown for me
I'm a fond sigh in a memory
I'm the one who wouldn't stay
I wonder if that thirteenth summer lingers on my mind
If you do the leaving first, you don't get left behind
And I prayed, Please God, please
Can't you see me down here on my knees
I just want things back the way they used to be
Two's sublime and three's a crowd
Looks like I am the odd one out
