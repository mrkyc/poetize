Putting my heart out on the line
My emotions say this is serious, but do you agree?
Or am I living a fantasy?
Every time I see you with another man
You always say he's just a friend
Thought that I could take it, but this heart of mine is breaking
It's harder now to face it, I don't want to understand it
Can you pretend you don't love me
Just tell me now, I'll set you free
Girl in my mind you're all I need
And baby I've been no good at make believe
Maybe somebody did you wrong
Or even you heard this all before
So you hesitate, are you afraid? Or is this a game?
I want to know, I'm tired of wondering
But girl if my timing just ain't right
Then we've got to move on with our lives
But tell the truth, you really want me too, there's nothing I can do
To convince you this is right
Can you pretend you don't love me
Just tell me now, I'll set you free
Girl in my mind you're all I need
And baby I've been no good at make believe

And I can't, I don't want to go back to living without you, no
Can you pretend you don't love me
Just tell me now, I'll set you free
Girl in my mind you're all I need
And baby I've been no good at make believe
Can you pretend you don't love me
Just tell me now, I'll set you free
Girl in my mind you're all I need
And baby I've been no good at make believe
Can you pretend you don't love me
Just tell me now, I'll set you free
