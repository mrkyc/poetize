Girl, I've been thinking 'bout what you mean to my life
Cause I know that without you
Things would not be right
Don't want to change our situation at all
That sometimes my mind tends to wander too far
I've seen some others, and their love goes on for years
Can you assure me that we too would last for years?
This is the only way to explain it to you
That if I'd ever have to live without you
There ain't no telling what I'd do

Cause if I'd ever lose my woman
I hope that I'm the strong one
I can just see my reaction
No control of what would happen
It would surely tear my world apart
If I ever lose my woman, I'd lose my heart

Remember when I promised you my faith and trust
I'm here to tell you that I'll never give you up
Baby, my heart is in this all the way
And I don't want nothing about us to ever, ever change

Cause if I lose my woman
I hope that I'm the strong one
I can just see my reaction
No control of what would happen
It would surely tear my world apart
If I ever lose my woman, I'd lose my heart

Some say it's a part of life, yeah
And some can understand it when others don't know why
Baby, life without you wouldn't mean a thing
No, no
I hope this never, never happens to me
No, no

Cause if I lose my woman
I hope that I'm the strong one
I can just see my reaction
No control of what would happen
I'll never be the same
I'll never feel the same
Oh, oh.  Don't you know I'd go insane
If I ever lose my woman, I'd lose my heart
(If I lose my woman,)
I hope that I'm the strong one
I can just see my reaction
No control of what would happen
I'll never be the same, never feel the same, never leave the same
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no
If I, I ever lose my woman, oh, I'd lose my heart
(If I lose my woman,)
