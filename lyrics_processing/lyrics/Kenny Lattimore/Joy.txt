He left you wanting and with nowhere to turn
You hid your feelings, kept a smile on your face
You fooled some people but not me
But now you're living alone, pretending that's what you want
When really loneliness grows
Before you give up on love, try one more time 'cause I know
That I can restore your hope
I'll bring you joy and so much happiness, love and tenderness
No girl, you can't resist
I'll bring you joy and so much happiness, love and tenderness
No girl, you can't resist
You say you're moving slow 'cause you have been hurt
I understand 'cause when you go through you learn
I'll take each step with you to make sure it's right
I know it's gonna work this time
But don't begin to compare, sincerity and intent
While holding on to the past
I'll love you body and soul, commit my life just to show
Why don't you give me a chance?
I'll bring you joy and so much happiness, love and tenderness
No girl, you can't resist
I'll bring you joy and so much happiness, love and tenderness
No girl, you can't resist
