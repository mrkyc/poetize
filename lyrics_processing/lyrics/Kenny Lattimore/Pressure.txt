You know it's about that time
Lay it on me so heavy like the bassline
Keep me so cool like the winter
No shame, serve it up, need your dinner, babe
And like a nice breeze through them summer trees
Get a quick trip in overseas
Pressure, heart fired up, like a diamond, baby
You're my star, might go blind 'cause your shine crazy, ooh

Every time you leave me, baby
I feel used (I feel used)
Give it to me so good, can't forget you're all mine
You're all mine, oh
Don't give that good love to nobody (Don't you dare)
When you call, I'll pull up every time
Ooh, it's just that good
Oh, it's pressure (Ooh)
Spent a lot of time, no, I can't deny, it's pressure
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, it's pressure)
Let me get a hit of that, babe
Ooh, you're my medicine, I need my pressure

Gotta put it all in perspective, yeah
Can't even wrap my head 'round the things you do
Do it so good, oh my (Oh my)
Way I fiend for you gotta be a crime, no lie
Take me up high, babe, way up
Promise I ain't ever lookin' down, baby
Keep me dancin', no headlights
Stop playin' with me, know I need that get right
