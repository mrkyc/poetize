My brothers are in need
Lord, let my voice
And song touch their souls
Let my life speak to the heart
Let me share with them how far
You went to show
The real meaning of love
Lord, I pray in all I may win some
But Lord, if only one, let Your will be done
There's no happiness in me
If I have not pleased You
When You call my name
I want to hear You say well done, well done
When I see You face to face
I want to hear You say, well done, well done
There's so much hate
And struggle day by day
That we forget
What really matters most
If it's bread my sisters need
Then their hunger I will feed
Just send Your word
And speak it right through me

Lord if You want me to go
You know I will
But if You want me to stand
I'll stand still
Lord, just guide my steps
Oh, like You said You would
Become my best
Lord, it's nothing without You
I'm nothing without You, no
I commit my way
Establish every thought
Lord show me how to love
Show me how to live, be in my tongue
I want to be pleasing to You
Everything You want me to do
Lord, I'll do it, Lord, I'll do it
Jesus for You
Well done
