Staying with the man who can love you like I can
He don't deserve to have a woman like you
And you don't deserve to have a man that's not true
Queen, and I mean that, I'm not just saying that
One of a kind and not just because you're fine
He don't deserve to have a woman like you
And you don't deserve to have a man that's not for you
Girl, it's not to drive me crazy
Listen to the words you're saying
How could you just sit and let him
Take your precious love for granted
It's a good thing I don't know him
I don't feel no shame in saying
Evidently he can see that
Anyone would want his lady
Hurt you, cheat you, I can't believe that you're
Staying with the man who can love you like I can
He don't deserve to have a woman like you
And you don't deserve to have a man that's not true
Queen and I mean that, I'm not just saying that
One of a kind and not just because you're fine
He don't deserve to have a woman like you
And you don't deserve to have a man that's not for you

I thought you recognized that I've been
The shoulder that you run to crying
The one you always couldn't fight in
Baby, tell that it's over and you're gone
Girl, there's so much that I want to show you
'Cause in your eyes, girl I can see
My future, my lover and eternity
Baby think about it, we don't know how
To give you all the things you know love's about
Listen baby, I can show you how it should be, baby
To kiss away all of your pain would take me
Just hearin', you're sayin', come love me right now
Hurt you, cheat you, I can't believe that you're
