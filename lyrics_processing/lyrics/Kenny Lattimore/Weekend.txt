Cos you know its over due
Maybe we can if you ain't got other plans
I know something we could do
Girl you know its overdue
Last time I saw ya we were together
Do you remember times that we shared
Cos I still remember your simple pleasures
The way that you move and the way that you dance
It's been too long much to long
And I can get you off my mind
So lets hook up like old times
Hit me up with feets so right
It's the weekend hopin we can chill again sort of like we use to
Cos u know its over due
Maybe we can if you ain't got other plans
I know something we could do
Girl u know its overdue
What you been up to
Are you still single
Doin the friend thing I like to know
I wanna see ya so why won't you stop by
I miss your touch girl I miss your smile
Its been too long much to long
And I can get you off my mind
So lets hook up like old times
Hit me up with feets so right
