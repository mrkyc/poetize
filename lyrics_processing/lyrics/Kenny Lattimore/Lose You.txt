Why would I do something to lose you?
Like your heart isn't valued
Love is there like I told you
My consistency is what sold you
Reassure this is what I'm willing to give
Forever is the name of the game
With age, things change
But lovers stay the same, baby

Won't give you a reason to go crazy
This love don't come with maybes
I don't gotta yell for you to hear me
I don't gotta speak for you to feel me
As love pass by, I won't get passive
Words do help but watch my actions, oh

Why would I do something to lose you?
Why would I do something to lose you?
Why would I do something to lose you?
Why would I do something to lose you?
Why would I do?

Like I'm that guy that's reckless or selfish
Or disrespectful, wanna give you perspective
And show you where respect is
If you're winnin', I'm winnin'
Let's rewrite the definition
I'll be submissive with your permission
It's okay, I know you're too hurt
To talk about your pain, just listen
