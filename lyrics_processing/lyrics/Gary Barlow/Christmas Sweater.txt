You poured the brandy baby, dressed the tree
Got the table looking Christmassy
Wrapped the presents and lit all the lights up it's true
But something's wrong with all this right
Somebody's light is not so bright
One thing here could use some cheer, and that's you

Because everyone you know and everyone you don't
They're wearing Christmas sweaters so it's crazy that you won't

Put your Christmas sweater on, it has got to be done
Oh, the uglier the better hon, don't be the only one
You'll light up everybody's faces
Babe, you know the time has come
(Come on, come on, come on)
Play along, play along and get your Christmas sweater on

It doesn't matter if you don't look cool
Everybody's following the Christmas rule
Remember December, forget everything that you know
Oh, you gotta try to put your pride on pause
Show a little reindeer or some Santa Claus
Ain't no hiding, time has come to go
You might also like
To get your sweater baby, 'cos I just can't wait
Come and join the party before it's too late

Put your Christmas sweater on, it has got to be done
Oh, the uglier the better hon, don't be the only one
You'll light up everybody's faces
Babe, you know the time has come
(Come on, come on, come on)
Play along, play along and get a Christmas sweater on
And get a Christmas sweater on

Put your Christmas sweater on, it has got to be done
Oh, the uglier the better hon, don't be the only one
You'll light up everybody's faces
So babe, you know the time has come
(Come on, come on, come on)
Play along, play along and get your Christmas sweater on

Get it on
Get a Christmas sweater on
Get it on, get it on
Get a Christmas sweater on
Put it on, put it on
Get your Christmas sweater on
Get it on, get it on
