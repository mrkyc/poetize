I can see them, see them forming perfect lines
Ladies dressed up to the nines
Gentlemen and Philistines
I can hear them, everyone's a critic here
Whispering it loud and clear
Is this the failure of the year?

Oh, in any other career you would know
Know where you're going to
In any other career, they would show you respect
Oh, but here they're never going to

Something about this night
That you just can't forget
They sip champagne, smoke cigarettes
Win or lose, you wouldn't bet
Cause there is something about this night
All actors call to one
Chorus line, prepare for song
Is it too late to change everyone?
There's only one night to impress unreasonable expectations
Something about this night, oh
Something about this night
With only one night to address unreasonable expectations
Something about this night, oh
Something about this night
You might also like
I can see them reaching for their daggers now
Hoping I would land face down
Ready to paint me as a clown
I can feel them yawning, calling for the end
Oh, they're sharpening their pens
Using all my blood instead of ink

Oh, in any other career you would know
Know where you're going to
In any other career, they would show you respect
Oh, but here they're never going to

Something about this night
That you just can't forget
They sip champagne, smoke cigarettes
Win or lose, you wouldn't bet
Cause there is something about this night
All actors call to one
Chorus line, prepare for song
Is it too late to change everyone?
There's only one night to impress unreasonable expectations
Something about this night, oh
Something about this night
With only one night to address unreasonable expectations
Something about this night, oh
Something about this night
It's a fight, it's a shove, it's a labour of love
It's a journey to know where you've seen
It's over, it's thankless, I've taken my chances
Does anyone know what I mean?
If there's ever a time I should stay low
If there's ever a time I should say no
Waiting for six hundred people to make up their minds
Is why there's something about this night

Yeah, 'cause there is something about this night
That you just can't forget
They sip champagne, smoke cigarettes
Win or lose, you wouldn't bet
Cause there is something about this night
All actors call to one
Chorus line, prepare for song
Is it too late to change everyone?
There's only one night to impress unreasonable expectations
Something about this night, oh
Something about this night
With only one night to address unreasonable expectations
Something about this night, oh
Something about this night, oh
Something about this night
