So, if this is the last time
We will be standing wall to wall
We're right to surrender
Soon we can walk through different doors

We've a million reasons
Just to be apart
Till the morning comes
And before the emptiness starts

Will you just lie to me
Whisper the words that you don't mean
Share with me the love, that you'll never feel
Baby, lie to me
Show me the way we'll never be
And the tenderness that I'll never see
Baby, lie to me

I know what you're thinking
But I don't believe we could go on
And I know the feeling
The feeling inside when love has gone
You might also like
Now the times upon us
Only pain can win
Baby, one last time
Before the loneliness begins

Will you just lie to me
Whisper the words that you don't mean
Share with the love that you'll never feel
Baby lie to me
Show me the way we'll never be
And the tenderness that I'll never see
Baby lie to me

We have a million reasons
Just to be apart
Till the morning comes
And before the emptiness starts

Will you just lie to me
Whisper the words that you don't mean
Share with me the love that you'll never feel
Baby, lie to me
Just lie to me
Show me the way we'll never be
And the tenderness that I'll never see
Baby, baby, lie to me
Share with me the love that you'll never feel
Baby, lie to me
Just come on, lie to me
Show me the way we'll never be
And the tenderness that I'll never see
Baby, baby, lie to me
Baby, lie to me
Lie to me
Baby, baby, lie to me
Just lie to me
And whisper the words that you don't mean
Share with me the love that you'll never feel
