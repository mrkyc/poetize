For you to say
If there's room inside your heart
I'm not used to playing
Love's silly games
Turn me down or let me start
You have to believe I'll make things right
Open your arms give up the fight
For all that you want
For all that you're feeling
There's a place where you can go
For all that you need
I will be waiting
To be your life your hero
Now if you decide
To run and hide
It's only you you're cheating
(The key's in your hand)
The key's in your hand
(You must understand)
You must understand
I won't be defeated no

For all that you need
