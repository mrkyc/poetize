My old friend lives up in the mountains
He says, even though interpretation's
What I count on, this little picture to me
Seems blurred, hard lines and the shadows come easy
I see it all just as clear as a bell
I just can't seem to set my easel to please me
I paint my heaven but it looks like hell

Yeah your blue might be gray
Your less might be more
Your window to the world might be your own front door
And your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night
It's just about right

He said, man I ain't coming down 'til my picture is perfect
And all the wonder is gone from my eyes
Down through my hands and onto the canvas
Still like my vision but still a surprise
Real life he says is the hardest impression
It's always moving so I let it come through
That my friend I say is the glory of true independence
Just to do what you do, what you do, what you do
You might also like
Yeah your blue might be gray
Your less might be more
Your window to the world might be your own front door
And your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night
It's just about right

My old friend came down from the mountain
Without even looking he found a little truth
You can go through life with the greatest of intentions
But you do what you do, what you just gotta do

Yeah your blue might be gray
Your less might be more
Your window to the world might be your own front door
And your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night
Yeah your blue might be gray
Your less might be more
Your window to the world might be your own front door
And your shiniest day might come in the middle of the night
That's just about right
