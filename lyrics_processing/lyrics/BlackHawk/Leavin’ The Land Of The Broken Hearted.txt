I see my mom and dad's wedding pictures
Hanging in the hall
That picture of happiness tries to sell it
But it doesn't tell it all
It's been 22 years since they walked down the aisle
Now they seldom talk and I never see 'em smile
They're living their lives in the land of the broken hearted
My old man gave me a job right out of high school
Just like his old man did
It's a dead end street of barely making ends meet
That I just can't live with
Now we can hang around here and wind up the same
Or kick it in gear girl and outrun the pain
We're leaving the land of the broken hearted
Letting our motors run
The sea of tears has finally parted
Baby our time has come
We're getting out now while we still have forever
For you and me girl it's now or never
We're leaving the land of the broken hearted
It's a lottery ticket chance of getting out
And I never met a winner
No nothing ever changes around hear but the weather
And what they had for dinner
It's a chain of broken dreams and we were born to break it
That bitter pill they're dealing we are not gonna take it

Letting our motors run
The sea of tears has finally parted
Baby our time has come
We're getting out now while we still have forever
For you and me girl it's now or never
We're leaving the land of the broken hearted
We're leaving the land of the broken hearted
Baby we are leaving, just you and me
Yeah, we are leaving the land
Leaving the land
Leaving the land of the broken hearted
Leaving the land, leaving the land
