I've been told many times that I lack commitment
That I run from responsibility
I've only got one life and I'm gonna live it
Ain't nobody puttin' chains on me

Left some broken hearts in my rearview mirror
A couple that I'll love 'til my dyin' day
They always wanted more than I was willin' to give 'em
So I'd just drift away

There's a whole lotta me I've got left to be
Places still to see, people left to meet
There's towns yet to visit, roads still to drive
Stars I haven't seen in a Montana sky
Lotta me I've got left to be
Love still to make, dreams still to dream
There's years yet to conquer before I die
And things I still ain't tried
There's a whole lotta me

Now people have to make their own decisions
Most of them spend a lifetime with regret
But me I've found that hind sights 20/20, I've seen plenty
Keep on searchin', I ain't through lookin' yet
