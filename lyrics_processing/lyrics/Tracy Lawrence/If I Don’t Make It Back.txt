We went out for beers and a couple laughs
Knowin' full-well that every bad joke that Jimmy told might be his last
So we laughed like the world wasn't at war
Said things to him we'd never said before and he teared up as he held up his glass

And he said, "Boys, if I don't make it back..."

Have a beer for me
Don't waste no tears on me
On Friday night sit on the visitor's side
And cheer for the home team
Drive my Camaro
90 miles an hour down Red Rock Road
With "Born to Run" blastin' on the radio
And find someone good enough for Amy
Who will love her like I would have
If I don't make it back

We said, "Hey man now that ain't gonna happen
Don't even think like that
If we know you, you'll pull through without a scratch"
He pulled me aside in the parkin' lot
Said, "Amy and me we're gonna tie the knot
You're my best man, just wanted you to know that"

If the good Lord calls me home
I'd like to think my friends will think about me when I'm gone

Well, Miller Light ain't my brand
But I drink one every now and then in his honor
And we ain't missed a home game yet
Had that Camaro at 110 on Red Rock Road
When the speakers blowed
And I introduced Amy to a friend of mine from Monroe
He's a good old boy, but you know
