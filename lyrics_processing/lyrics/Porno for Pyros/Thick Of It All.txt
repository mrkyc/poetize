You thought you were Jesus
But you find out you're the Antichrist
You were born so you get another chance
A chance to die and to get off this planet
You're in the thick of it all
You're in the thick of it all
You struggle? Hope you laugh
You thought you'd never know
You feel and that's the only thing you can depend on
I'll try praying if it'll move my friends
The dead are living in your blood with a little poison
You're in the thick of it all
You're in the thick of it all
You're in the thick of it all
You're in the thick of it all
I fell again, still I'm so excited
Anyway don't you love surprises?
You get to keep your heart and that I know
I give my time and it comes back to me
We're in the thick of it all
We're in the thick of it all
Oh, we're in the thick of it all (thick of it all)
We're in the thick of it all (thick of it all)
