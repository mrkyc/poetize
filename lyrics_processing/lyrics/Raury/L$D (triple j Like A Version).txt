I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm riding 'round in my system bumping LSD
I look for ways to say I love you
But I ain't into making love songs
Baby, I'm just rapping to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We made love under pretty lights, LSD
Ooh, get a feeling it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, you know I really want love, sex, dreams

Party just started up
Dream of sharing love
Tongue at a lost for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dream of sharing love
Feelings for way too long
Said I really want to let it go
Said I really want to let it go
Said I really want to let it go
Said I really want to let it go

Yeah, we was up in the mountains
Five or ten days man, I wasn't really counting
Sipping on the shroom tea, I was never innocent
Living it, baby, can I smash? Count there, fuck it
I'm a nigga on a mission, I'm not here because of talent
Young and reckless too, keep it on a balance
Baby, you was tripping, now I'm reminiscing
'Bout a week in Utah when we went cowtipping
The prettiest thing that I ever seen
Didn't know that you had a thing for the morphine, the morphine
Remember what you told me cause you promised?
Ain't heard from you in months, I hate you to be honest
And now every single love song that I hear can make me vomit
And I really want to see you, your presence is a comet
Just a streak of beauty, see how you do me? And now my crew be
Thinking that I'm cooky when you did this to me
Now I'm through we can't end it smoothly, go see your groupies
While I roll another doobie, headed to the movies
Please excuse me
