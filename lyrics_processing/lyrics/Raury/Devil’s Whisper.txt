You better run, run from the devil
You better run, run from the devil
You better hide, hide
Hide from the
Hide from the

Young boy
Trying to rule the world I see
Well, young boy
I can give you everything
Diamonds
Everything you touch can be
Golden
But first you gotta listen to me

I'll tell the truth, I promise you
This world may frown upon the things I have you do
But I got taste, and I got style
I know the twists and turns to make your life worth-

Oh na na
Oh na na (Be careful)
Oh na na
Oh na na

You better run, run from the devil

Oh ya!
Hide from the!

My brother you could probably win in a shit talking competition
My compositions the opposition of all the shit that
Got niggas wishing to spit tragic, the shit that get
You deal crack and you spend cash on cement asses
My heart burns in the fire of truth
Got the heat of seven suns in the meteor treatment needed
More niggas burn on WorldStar than in 1792
Won't act like I'm any better, you or me, I am you
We are hate, we are love, as below so above
We got poison everywhere so what's a war on a drug?
We at war with ourselves, talking war with no guns
So if you had to meet yourself would you go do it or run?
Cause I could be MLK, I could be Juicy J
Or a lame on Instagram that shows the world his AK
Fourty seven's the way, you can follow a stray
At the end of the day, at the end of the day you better-
(Runnn!)
Run in some type of direction
Cause the people going nowhere are the ones that are flexing
I'm not trying to be a preacher, I was never a reverend
But I can take your ass to church and show you glimpses of heaven you better
(Runnn!)
