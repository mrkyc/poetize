Outside this morning saw the forest ablaze
See I walked outside this morning saw the forest ablaze
See I walked outside this morning saw the forest ablaze
See I walked outside this morning saw the forest...
See I walked outside this morning saw the forest ablaze
See I walked outside this morning, had my breath took away
See I walked outside this morning and I stood there amazed
Saw the fire and the ashes and the smoke on the horizon for days

And you can look into my eyes
Bitch you see the fire
Bitch I know you see the fire
Got the eyes of a prophet
Wait, tell me why you're constantly stressin'
Undress your mind and just follow me into heaven
Your presence here is a blessing
I know it's just what you need
You're an indigo child I see
And I plea you follow my lead
Yes I plea you follow my lead
As far as I've been concerned
I've been learning about this Earth
And I don't believe that it's flat
And I don't believe that it's round
But we're 'bout to one day discover
The truth as friends or as lovers
It doesn't matter to me, but I know it matters to you

Raury on a journey
A journey to forever
A hero of the past
A savior of the future
Yep I've been around the world
I don't have souvenirs
I took all of my pictures
I threw them in the ocean
I was born with no religion
In east Atlanta, Georgia
I'd never sell my soul
I'd never be a lawyer
Cause I don't follow the laws
I am an animal
You're rocking camouflage
I don't fuck with your cause

Tha blog is hot, tha blog is hot, ha-ha
Tha blog is hot, tha blog is hot, ha-ha

So we can hate it or love it
Shit, I'm a real nigga
And I don't give a fuck about these bitches and their pictures
And I don't give a fuck about these niggas with the cameras
I'll always be a nigga from the east side of Atlanta
And just cause I got manners and speak with proper grammar
Don't mean I'll ever think twice about slapping you with the hammer
I'm in another dimension, I wasn't raised in the hood
But y'all niggas don't pay attention so niggas really been good with pretending
But not me nigga, you can try copy nigga
You can wax on and then off like I'm Mr. Miyagi nigga
You'll never stop me my nigga, never stopping me nigga
You'll never stop me my nigga, never stopping me nigga
You'll never stop me my nigga, never stopping me nigga
You'll never stop me my nigga, never stopping me nigga
You'll never stop me my nigga, never stopping me nigga
