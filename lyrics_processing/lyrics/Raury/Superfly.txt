Yeah, we all want someone
And we all want something
Life can be so simple
When we just want one thing
Yeah, we all want someone
Yeah, we all want something
If there's one thing I know it's that I'm gonna be
Superfly!
It's how I'm feeling on this summer night
Come pretty lady Im'ma hold you tight
Just know that I will always say goodbye
I'm feeling superfly
You don't believe whats here before your eyes
Got gasoline and now I just need the fire
No transportation I've been getting by

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

Fly, I do this for life
King of the clouds there's a ribbon in the sky
Drive by anyone that tell me plan B should've been plan A
B people don't see when you superfly
Features  extent-iary defintion, you can get a dictionary
Everybody in the air like love in February
Don't believe it exist so maybe we are afraid
Kids these days crazy off the drugs
Know the world already can nobody tell us shit
And we never get together so the bars never split
When you're livin' in the city you don't want to be a mess
So we get used to being a-lone, pack of cigarillos, a smooth bottle of patron
A world where I can chill with no plan to stay long
Cause I'mma live it up until I die
Superfly

Cause, we all want someone

Superfly!
It's how I'm feeling on this summer night
Come pretty lady Im'ma hold you tight
Just know that I will always say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
