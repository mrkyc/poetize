Honor to
Honor to love you
Honor to love you
When you're alone
And you're far from home
Her name's the same but emojis are gone
Said baby girl there's a fork in our road

But you're a star (all the time)
And when I leave they'll all know who you are
Cause you're a star

We're so very young and full of love
You convinced my soul that maybe I should stay
(Just like a star)
We're too very young to be in love
Girl I think you know I know that I should wait
Ah girl, girl I tried so hard
Swear I tried so hard
Even prayed to God
Even prayed to God
(Just like a star)
So this one goes to you
And all the things you do
Said this one goes to you
You might also like
(Honor to love you
Honor to love you)
And all the things you do
(Honor to love you
Honor to love you
Do it all the time)

No I can't even stay
That would just make you the same old case
Cause I'm a fool, I'm ashamed
Prolly give your ass all the food on my plate
Now you're pushin' 28
Smokin' hella weed in a crib in LA
Never had a bill that a nigga didn't pay
House got a view full of dreams you ain't chase
You pretend it's amazin'
Hittin' up friends to rub it in their faces
Hittin' up him to tell him he can stay here
And forget that I stay here
Hit up the plug for some pills on your payday
Don't dig your grave and forget that I stay here
Don't dig your grave and forget that I lay here
Don't dig your grave and start gettin' ungrateful
First off your view of Atlanta was hateful
Then you met me and decided to stay here
Then I blew up when I first graduated
Made you a promise I never be changin'
I shoulda made your ass promise the same, cause
Gave you keys to the city
Why you go left and go out on a nigga?
Why you go out and decide you a stripper?
But you're a star (all the time)
And when I leave they'll all know who you are
Cause you're a star

Honor to love you
Honor to love you
Honor to love you
