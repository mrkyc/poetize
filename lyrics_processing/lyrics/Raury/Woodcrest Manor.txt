It's like...

See I've been living in this house forever
I was born and raised and birthed and grown
Woodcrest Manor Eastern of Atlanta
Well at least I had a sense of home
Like mama when we move in
Always tell me some' with some doubt
Watch every stranger move in
Helped all my homies move out
Watched every house get sold
Watched every neighbor get old
I saw that sunset back when I was six
Well I guess them trees growed
Now my vivid perception is blocked
Then my life for a second was stopped
Saw an angel from heaven she talked
In the clearest description she taught

If this view becomes nothing new to you
Just remember once it was beautiful (x4)

See I've been with this girl for years
Through every single smile and tear
The time has passed and now I fear
I don't feel the same no more
But who's to blame not me or her
It could just be this universe
That caused this love to bloom at first
Then wilt and wither through its thirst
So blame it on that lack of water
I know I'm gaining badder Karma
Through all those hearts I've broken
I'm hoping that down the road that when I have a child that it's not a daughter
But when I'm having childish thoughts
And when I feel completely lost
And when my heart begins to frost
I just think of what them angels taught

Ever come across something for the first time
Be it a person place or thing
They gave you an instant feeling of happiness
Made you glad to be alive
And eventually as time goes on the feeling gets weaker, and weaker, and weaker
And you don't know why
It's slowly becoming less exciting
And the whole time you're in denial about this decreasing value
And you know it in the back of your mind
That the feeling's fading away
And  it's almost over
But ignore reality and continue to keep trying
Eventually the feeling becomes harder to reach or just disappears completely
And it leaves us pondering a crucial question:
Does everything eventually lose it's meaning?
Will the things that make us happy today, make us happy tomorrow?
Will this joke always make me laugh?
Will the bright lights in times square always astound me?
Or will I just get so used to them that I forget they're even there?
Will I love this person forever?
Will this person love me forever?
