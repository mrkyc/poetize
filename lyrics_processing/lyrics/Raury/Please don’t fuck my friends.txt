I know that what we had is dead and gone
(Shit man, y'know, sometimes)
I hope you still want me in the end
(I could in your life for a reason not just for not just for a season)
And now I'm leavin' the city
I know you need somethin' different (it's okay) but not him
But not him

Anyone but him
Anyone but
(I got my fucking black and white striped shirt on, Adidas sweatpants nigga)
Anyone but
Please don't fuck my friend
I know that what we had is dead and gone
I hope you still want me in the end
And now I'm leavin' the city
I know you need somethin' different but not him

Anyone but him
Anyone but
Anyone but

Swore I told you that I had other women
Swore, swore I told you tell your friends mind their bidness
Shoulda known you was killin' inside

Swore I told you who I am from beginning

Swore I told you tell your friends mind their bidness
Shoulda known you was killin' inside
I'm a villain inside, I'm a Gemi-Gemini
I'ma fake nigga, I'ma reptilian inside
