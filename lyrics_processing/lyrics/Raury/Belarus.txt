The things, I would do to you...
But I can't give my heart to you baby, Belarus
I can't, I'll be good to you
Give my name, give my heart to you baby, Belarus
I'm still a child, far too young for love
But I still try 
You're in the dark, afraid of what we've come to love
The things, that I would do to you
I don't say, 

Yeah, yeah
I can pull 'em by the dozen
You came through you brought your friend, first, second cousin
You were different than the others (others)
I was always plottin' on you, always up to something
I believe I fell in love but it was just a drug
Yeah it was just a drug, it was just a drug
Yeah it was just a drug, yeah, it was just a drug, and it was just a drug
I remember you were studying
Dubbling, dubbling over our last night in Dublin
Molly, water's got you troublin'
A couple thousand miles from home not really thinkin' of it
I believe I fell in love but it was just a drug
Yeah it was just a drug, yeah it was just a drug, and it was just a drug

A stones throw from the Texaco down Allgood Road
Saw the horizon give birth to the Sun
Saw the cops down the block
Dapped the dealer and run
Kept the weed and cigarillos in the sleeve of my hood
The victorious euphoria
The memorial of past lives lived
I like smokin' with you, I like takin' a trip
Wanna go where you go
And moonwalk through heaven's gate
I blew the sauce
Shooed off my delegates
I don't trust nobody
I'm sorry but everybody wanna be somebody
I'm prolly Mr. Miyagi
Wipe that dust up off me, Hiya
Used to be supplier
Wanna cut me off but you could not think despite
Saw that shit comin' like a Maya
Talkin' to a nigga in his prime but
Nobody care about no car parties
You pray to God that shit don't walk your way
Young kamikaz-ah, visitor, visitor
Oh nanana, kept prison of, prison of
I'm not the one that's runnin' through your veins
Don't even know your middle, first, last name
Young kamikaz-ah, visitor, visitor
Oh nanana, kept prison of, prison of
Your guilty pleasure don't you be ashamed
I'll be your baby, be your part time thing
Young kamikaz-ah, visitor, visitor
Oh nanana, kept prisoner, prisoner
Of-

I'm losing my mind
Tryna do what is right
All because of things
I would do to you
All the things
I would do to you
Things
I would do to you
All the things
