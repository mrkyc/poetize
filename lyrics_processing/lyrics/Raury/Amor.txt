Okay so,  when you was talking about, those things
And all the other shit on your...
Like when you passed me the binder in class and I was like, shit
I asked for the pencil and...

I've been thinking about the days when I'd come by
Knocking on your door for your company
Days when I'd tell lies
Playing with your hair through the summer breeze
Days when you'd, come through
Never really thought that you'd ever run from me
Never really thought you'd ever run from me

Now I see the pain I've caused
And now you're just a memory
You're nothing but a memory
Why don't you come here lil' darling and rest your head
And tell me every little thing that's on your mind
I can be heartless and cold
And sometimes I'm distant
But baby you know I got that other side
And I won't change
You can't change me
Don't act confused
Or play stupid
I've told you this a million times
You might also like
Now I see the pain I've caused (to you)
And now you're just a memory
We're nothing but enemies

I'm focused baby, I'm focused baby
I ain't even really been smoking lately
Everybody's talkin' bout homecoming
I don't give a fuck about a social life, shit
I'm focused baby, I'm focused baby
I really really did a lot of growing lately
Never be the boy I was yesterday
At this point, you ain't even know me babe
I'm focused baby, I'm focused baby
Keep it real I don't even got time for ya
Just fuck me baby, Just fuck me baby
I don't even really got a dime for ya but

Baby I adore ya
I got a proposition for ya
Said
Said
Saaa- aiiid
Baby I adore ya
Baby I adore ya
I've been thinking about the days when I'd come by
Knocking on your door for  your company
Instead I see your mother, who came to answer the door
Reporting to my misfortune that you fast asleep
Them days when I'd tell lies
Playing with your hair through the summer breeze
Tell you that I love you, I'll always be here forever
How clever was my disguise cause you fell for me
Them days when you, come through
Never really thought that you'd ever run from me
