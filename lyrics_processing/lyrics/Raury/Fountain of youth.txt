So bold, so young, so cold but I'm not sick
Walk 'round, head down, so proud on the watchlist
Wish time had a stop switch, wish time had a stop switch
So I could watch this
All happen
Sometimes this shit's unreal
Just wanna watch this, just wanna
Come home, shoes off, hand greet me with a backrub
She cares for me, cries for me, longs for me but is that love?
No it's not, not at all, real love is a lack of judge
In the court, suit and tie, feel afraid but I'm Darren Wilson
At least you care and listen
At least you care and listen
You're always there in spirit, always
Stone Mountain, hometown, crossed path with my old boys
Most of 'em ain't livin' right, ten years ago we stole toys
From the store, now we grow, far apart but I roll joints
When I'm in town, hang around, chose this life and you chose yours
But you ain't smilin', you get high
But you ain't, smilin'
No you ain't
You might also likeFountain of youth, I'm bound for you, I promise that my heart is gold
I live for love, I live for peace, I live to keep from growin' old
To tell the truth, I'm scared to die, terrified I'd lose it all
So verify I won't lose it all
Cause all my life I been losing things and I'm not attached
I don't choose and cling, to miss things I lost
I want newer things
Cause that feeds the monster
That plants the seeds of unhappiness that becomes a tree
And you lose yourself and forget the peace is inside of you and inside of me
And you lose the feel of your memory
I mean how you'd feel back when you were three?
You would dream and think lucidly
You and me would hit school and we would get change for life and stick glue to seats
You would see to be cool that we must get shoes like these and be loose in streets
But this is just nothing new to me
