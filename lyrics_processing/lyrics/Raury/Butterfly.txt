Sometimes I wish I could be a butterfly
Flying by, flying high
Sometimes I have visions of suicide
Take it away, help me erase
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Why don't you take it away, help me erase
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm just a young nigga, that no one knew
I grew alone, to be alone is nothing new
With the, whole world in front of me
Wrote this song here for the bitches that front on me
And niggas that stunt on me
I walked the school halls they would call me a wannabe
I did the small shows that nobody would come to see
I gave in to madness, I would cave in to sadness
I would only imagine that
I'd become a nigga like this
I'mma chase my dreams with a suicide wish
All these motherfuckers treat me like a side dish
I cook em like the crystals when I'm making acid, acid
When I ain't had no friends I was on my grind
I cannot pretend, got my dividends
As a middle man
Now I can make a gram, I can cop a Benz
Ain't no stopping him
Under pressure from the evils up above
You might also like
Sometimes I wish I could be a butterfly
Flying by, flying high
Sometimes I have visions of suicide
Take it away, help me erase
Oh yeah

Fuck you nigga you don't like me
You're just using me
All this friendliness is new to me
Who are you to me?
When them highschool parties got to jumping, not including me
I don't trust nobody now 'cause everybody cool with me
But you just want what I got
But when I needed rides thought you never had a spot
But look at how them tables got them nice turn tops
It's time for you to wonder if I fuck with you or not
You are not, you are not
Claim you're real but you are not
And since I left the 285 a nigga learned a lot
The wicked make it in this game the real ones they do not
So all my heros fake, and all my idols false and forgot that
They're the only reason I was breathing
When I was fourteen I was thinking 'bout leaving
Alone up in my room with guitars every weekday every weekend
And a hand full of pills no one knew about my secrets
Sometimes I wish I could be a butterfly
Flying by, flying high
Sometimes I have visions of suicide
Take it away, help me erase
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Why don't you take it away, help me erase
