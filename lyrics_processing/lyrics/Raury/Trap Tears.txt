Mama cryin', can't survive
She lost her mind, she's stressin' out
She needs to pay bills
Son took her money, daughter hungry
Bought the shit, there's no refunding
She's high still
He owes the gang, they gave him weight
But he was weak, he has a week
Or he will be killed
And papa died, he used to trap
His son's a man, but men don't cry
Unless they're trapped tears

It ain't nothin' but them tears in the trap
Tears in the trap
It ain't nothin' but them tears in the trap
Tears in the...
It ain't nothin' but them tears in the trap
Tears in the trap
It ain't nothin' but them tears in the trap
Tears in the trap
Tears in the... trap

They taint the future, newest noose
To hang the youth imprint your mind
Before you turn twelve
The sex and drugs and rock and roll
Before hormones we've been exposed
Before we know ourselves
Her baby's early, papa workin'
16, 13, what the tragic story I tell
He lost his job, his homie Breaded
Got connected to the plug
His family needs help
You might also like
It ain't nothin' but them tears in the trap
Tears in the trap
It ain't nothin' but them tears in the trap
Tears in the...
It ain't nothin' but them tears in the trap
Tears in the trap
It ain't nothin' but them tears in the trap
Tears in the trap
Tears in the... trap

So who's to say that youth today
Cannot be shot or robbed or slain
By someone, yourself
And who's to say that he was wrong
His story's long
He wakes and sleeps in everyday hell
So mind your manners, Ps and Qs
Cause nothing new
No nothing new can happen to the trap
We think it's cool and harmless too
But who are you?
Yes look around, you might just be trapped

The street preacher's anger grew violently as he continued to voice his truth. Unaware that his passion to justify these views of hatred were also rooted in love. Much like fog on a Georgia morning, love can shroud our eyes, make us blind, blind to who we are, blind to who we are
