Talkin' 'bout a revolution
Talkin' 'bout a new reunion
Who is bold enough to do it?
Do you feel the power of music?
Well I got some news for you, man
Your so-called constitution
Will advocate the mass polution
To keep us from the evolution
From the evolution, the revolution

Tell me who gon' bring upon the fire
Flames of revolution, King keep on feeding y'all bullshit
I can do it all within a minute
Simple-ly to fit in, worried 'bout hit-hit-hit-hits and
Go and hide along with all the hidden
Get my gwalla guap and go along with Guadalupe to the hills and
Tell you all the future is the children
Please save the children
With Mr. Officer killin'

Lord save this burning earth, rotting from the inside out
Blood yet to clout and clot the juggular of the insipid mothafucka called "humanity"
Raping and damaging everything in it's way
It's child will be raised on McDonald's and gasoline water
Each day now a battle for morals or dollars
We slaughter for profit, our sons know no father
The ozone the word that is no longer brought up
God bless the soul that believes all we need is love
To stop this bullet train to extinction
I've been convinced to believe that it's all over
And as we dance in this burning room
I can only relax and turn up the tune
And I advise the naysayers, to save yourself first
In this burning earth
Earth, earth, earth, earth
Earth, earth, earth, earth
Earth, earth, earth, earth
