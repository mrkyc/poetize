Hey, we didn't get to talk
Hum, but, I meant to say, hum sorry I missed your call and, hum
We were in the woods and shit
And yeah, I just want to let you know
So I called you back

So leave my mind alone, I'm made to have my peace
The forest is my home, I'm safer in the trees
So maybe you should go or maybe we could leave
Just please ignore the ghosts that's chasin' after me

Not tonight, I will not show my face go find a new boo
Personal, you might take, need my space, nothing against you
I climb the mountains to the climax, in search of new views
I am no different from the setting sun or the new moon
Instigate, infiltrate, I'm afraid my mind is on you
Wonder how, wonder how, wonder how, you do what you do
My grandma, my grandma, my grandma would practice voodoo
Something about you supernatural, Kamasutral
If I could forget about her
If I could forget about her

So leave my mind alone, I'm made to have my peace
The forest is my home, I'm safer in the trees
So maybe you should go or maybe we could leave
Just please ignore the ghosts that's chasin' after me

Her blue breeze feelin' very nice
I'm in the woods that's paradise
My iPhone holds the ear advice, 99 problems that I just don't care about
I'll prolly hide up from these parasites
Pair of Paris honeys
Pair of parents and a pair of dykes
Everyone is welcome to the woods, circle, square or not
Come and take a chance, take a gamble here's a pair of dice
She wanna know if I'm here or not
She wanna know if I'm here or not
You innocent, you don't hear, don't see, don't speak no evil
You be safe when the pigs comes for my whereabouts
All the things that done turned out
Hide your face babygirl you rare they don't care about
All the things they wearin' out, chasin' every dime
Last place every rat race is behind
Where's your trail of breadcrumbs?
You should follow mine
Some will follow trends
Other people follow signs
To a safe place that is safe by all design
Free of all space, free of all
Free of all space, free of all

So leave my mind alone, I'm made to have my peace
The forest is my home, I'm safer in the trees
So maybe you should go or maybe we could leave
