I've known shaw my whole life
She'd just call to have fights
I'd come home and book flights
She'd keep callin' and I'd just keep travelin'
And I guess that all of them was right
Dirt was all up in her Sprite
Shit left all them leanin' right
But stand up tall my nigga, I love all my niggas
She set all them niggas right
No one ever put her on
Made each stranger feel at home
Gave it all to takers gone, now they're gone

Now they're gone
Do they know what is home?
What is home?
Well home is where your heart is
And home is where the sun is
And home is where the one is
Home is where you mom is, home is where your love is
Home is where it begins
I hope you realize this
That home is where it all is
Said home is where it all ends, home is where it all goes...

Just like satellites, yeah
Flowin' through the atmosphere, I see you, I see you
I see you, I see you, I see you, see you
Said, darlin', afterlife, yeah
Where will you be after here? Because you, because you
Because you, because you, because you, because you
Said you're going home, yeah
A place that you have never been, never been, never been
Never been, never been, never been, never been
Say you wanna know if it's real (real)
You say you need some evidence
Say you need some evidence

Well home is where your heart is
And home is where the sun is
And home is where the one is
Home is where your mom is, home is where your love is
Home is where it begins
I hope you realize this
That home is where it all is
Said home is where it all ends, home is where it all goes...
