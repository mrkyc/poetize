Just know
You are never alone
No, you are never alone
No matter where you go
I just want you to know
From L.A. to Tokyo
That you are never alone
No, you are never alone
All my heroes turn they back on me
I believe it's probably cause I'm actually not talented at all
If we gon' break it down cause factually
I make what I'm imagining
Not popular, not trafficking
They trap it on the radio
Now little kids got trapping dreams
Poppin' cats up in the tapestry
Of the culture fabric of the blackest peeps
Sensei, I needed you
Why didn't you come back and teach?
I needed you, repeated you
You said we could vibe anytime
Whole year ain't get replies
From the 10 times out of 10 I tried
Let me disclaim that you don't owe me dip and dots
Right before my suicide I heard your song and I'm still alive
Facing his career
I didn't have supporters, didn't have a mother by my side
Didn't have a homie, didn't have a mentor
Didn't have a father in my life
But I'ma be alright, beaming to the skies
And if I touch the clouds, then I might be alright
I might be alright, I might be alright
All I know is sacrifice, all I know is sacrifice
You might also like
You are never alone
You are never alone
No, you are never alone
No matter where you go
I just want you to know
From L.A. to Tokyo
That you are never alone
No, you are never alone

I'ma comeback with a vision
Got a hot lava and a flamethrower
Throwing fire bars on these lame boys
Helped me grow up, but the same boy
Young man with the heat rock
Boxed in by the sheet rock
Gold key in his left hand
But he aimed at by the street cops
With the hot lava and the flamethrower
For the fake boys and the ones you bring with ya
I'ma give you what you came for
Get your videos, let your cameras take picture
Hot lava and the flamethrower
I'm a fire, fire, fire, fire flame spitter
Fire, fire, fire, fire flame spitter
Fire, fire, fire, fire flame flame
Fire, fire, fire, fire flame spitter
Flying higher than the eagle wings
Get your saiyan to the higher powers
Lying lying, while them snitches take pictures
Burn your jersey you out the rasta
I awaken I am Ayahuasca
Shedding verses 'bout being real
Bumping you report more than Takanawa
Might deport you up off my island
Might deport you up off my island
Made your plays like a little boy
Know that I destroy all my foes in silence
Enjoy I'm at pure nirvana
We can roll if you really wanna
Cause you are never alone
You are never alone
No, you are never alone
No matter where you go
I just want you to know
From L.A. to Tokyo
That you are never alone
No, you are never alone

Where is my shadow, shadow, shadow?
Where is my shadow, shadow, shadow?
Where is my shadow, shadow, shadow?
