Forbidden knowledge can destroy mankind

I spend large hours of my days alone
I don't believe we share this universal space alone
I think we got a lot from them, they gave us phones
Internet and now we all know what is forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge is too great for a man
Think if man could read your mind, you think that man understands
How to use it with integrity, not conquering land
Would it  be good if we increased the lifespan, well that's forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge can destroy mankind
We can grow out of control like cancer under the skin of Mother Nature
Busy cities much alike to a tumor
Too many cells, the residents, the body's pollutor
I say woosah and alley-oop the chubby doobie to Judah
Child of Jacob, I know my history, I know we are Moors
There's a universe in her afro, hold us back though
There's a power in the black folk, well that's forbidden knowledge
At first they want to keep us separate but equal
But it's not so we fight against the hatred and evil
Now they let us think we got it and they killin' our people
Why does history repeat like a sequel? Well that's forbidden knowledge
Is God a man watching TV like people?
Rewinding his favorite parts to play it back like it's TiVo
Have I wrote this shit before? It all feels like a redo
And deja vu is left to die like our dreams do, but that's forbidden knowledge
I have some shocking memories as a kid
Waking up onto a table, a lab, some typa bizz
Too vivid to be a nightmare, mom would tell me that shit
Can't remember anything that they did, guess that's forbidden knowledge

Are dreams another kind of preview to Heaven?
We manifest our reality based on our personality
Karma from shit we did since the day we were seven
So did you share toys? Or did you masturbate at eleven
I'm a just a 90's baby, a millennial kid
Indigos are on the rise to make perennial shift
Hope this music stands long as Redwood Sequoias
Pyramids and stones, like stones from Stonehenge
Come on, let the future tell the truth
'Cause you a shell of you
You played your cards wrong, now you got hell in you
Be glad I still retain respect for you
'Cause I got bullets that'll kill yah if your vest is hell and heaven-proof
I'll never understand your corporate greed
Just a group of people, all they want is more than they need
Signing off on papers, blinded to the pain overseas
Blood resulting from the ink that they bleed, but that's forbidden knowledge

Forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge
So who put the liquor store across the street from the gun shop?
And the park a hop skip in the dark 'way from the gunshots
That rang out in the neighborhood where the youth's misunderstood
Fighting over concrete squares but the laws just ain't no good
I think their agenda's meant to kill us all
Now what good is education long as you can ball?
Standin' on the couch inside the club and hit the mall
Barely feed a bum, but you buy it all
I think they laughin' at us, cause while we're watchin' some cable
They was talkin' 'bout the economy, sharecroppers and stables
How to keep the horse runnin' his course, give him some blinders
So that he lack remorse for whoever's right beside him
His own kind, I pray you dig deeper
If you don't find, what you're lookin' for on the surface
The knowledge that you need can't be Nextel chirpin'
You're every bit of worth it, not worthless
You're kings and queens, were meant for better things
Than flexin' on the scene, or burstin' out the seams
Of your blouse that you told yourself you'd never wear outside your mama's house
'Cause the energy it lends puts strong women down, down
Brother, look, you don't need to go to jail just to read you a book
I wonder what Malcolm found after goin' to Mecca
Or the mindstate of Martin after visitin' Selma
Two leaders that were slain for speakin' the topic
