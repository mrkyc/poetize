*Harmonizing*

Always knew the magic was inside of me
You don't got no words but it got a meaning
Always had big dreams for what I could be
Even when I didn't know what I would be
I never found myself, I'm still finding me
If I've made you cry this an apology
You don't gotta worry 'bout if I'ma leave
'Cause babygirl you got that asstrology (oh)

Swore I, swore I told you I'd be home before the summer
But you'd rather mess around, I can't blame you if you wanna, huh
What's your sign? What's your name girl? What's your number?
Waste my time, girl I think I'd like to know you
Can you pull up? Where you roll up? Can you come up?
Hold the time so I know it's never over
Go on and tell them niggas to back off
Tell them niggas to fuck off
I am not over you
Tired of runnin' around
Losing my mind in that natural madness
I got bad habits, I try to fight it, how can I prove it
Heard what I mean, you got all my strings, you know how to pull them
Then  I get mad, I go make you sad, I'm back on my bullshit
Back on my bullshit, I am your bestfriend
All of my friends, think I am not friends now
I'm a magician, I'm not these niggas, but I'm not different
But I'm so different, saw you indifferent, blowin' me kisses
Think I'm with you, it's just an illusion
You got a vision, you got intentions, I'm gonna miss you
Hullabaloo, they keep disappearing

You don't got no words but it got a meaning

I remember we was underwater, you were thinkin' 'bout suicide and
Know you got some issues with your father
Something gon' change up the climate
I remember when you couldn't stand me
I know that you didn't understand me
I think I really like this environment
Stingray overhead gliding
And now I'm livin' how the fuck I wanna
I didn't mean to fuck up your prana
But fuckin' with me gonna get you commas
Fuckin' with me gon' learn you
That everything ain't what it seems
And most things are best a mystery
I know we got a lot of history
But you will never get the best of me
My memories of walkin' my dog Godrick chasin' blue birds on Allgood Church field
Your love is a taste of ambrosia too sweet for mortal tongues (mortal tongues)
Settle down before I fuck my 2-5, I'm too high to chill
I feel, I can't give the way I love the magic in me
Always knew the magic was inside of me
You don't got no words but it got a meaning
Always had big dreams for what I could be
Even when I didn't know what I would be
I never found myself, I'm still finding me
If I've made you cry this apology
You don't gotta worry 'bout if I'ma leave
'cause babygirl you got that asstrology

You got that ass, you got that ass, you got that asstrology
You got that ass, you got that ass, you got that asstrology
