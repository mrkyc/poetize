I'll find a way to settle down befo I'm 25
I'll change my ways, get my life, I mean
I'm living wild, up in the fire
And I'd rather die, with a smile get my wings and stay high
Stay high
I'll find a way to settle down befo I'm 25
I'll change my ways, get my life, I mean
I'm living wild, up in the fire
And I'd rather die, with a smile get my wings and stay high
Stay high

Yeah
No longer smiling 'cause I'm different
Been stuck inside a disharmonic world that doesn't get it
And trapped inside this body, I need freedom from this prison
And freedom from the one's that say they love me when they isn't
A wedding ring would never segregate me from the women
It's best to be in bed with me, and bettering  your interests
To tell the truth I'm twisted, I'm wicked, licking chicks and twisting chronic
Different sonic, comin' at you, not a starboy
I'm a comet, I'ma bringer of your doomsday
Tryna feed the whole hood today
Niggas out here be too fake
Niggas out here wear toupes
Gemini boy not two faced
Renaissance boy too cool, ay
I'ma pull up with two thangs
Out of my mind, might lose it
Said out of my mind, might lose it
Said out of mind, out of my, mind
Said out of mind, out of my, mind

I'll find a way to settle down befo I'm 25

And I'd rather die, with a smile get my wings and stay high
Stay high

I'm grateful to the women in my life, I love my mother
But what the fuck's a brother if a nigga couldn't trust you?
And I cannot discuss you, 'cause if I'm pullin' up I gotta cut ya, gut ya
We both from the gutter, don't you stutter
I'm strolling all alone, Summer's eve, I'm out of balance
I'd prolly blow my brains out in a booth in Calabasas
I'm not your Jimi Hendrix, pop a thousand
Something new, I'm something now
And you'll be grateful when I'm gone
So if my album sell a thousand
I'll be golden, frozen, platinum, holding trophies in my palace
I was made to bring a balance
I was made to beat the challenge
I'ma toast you with my chalice
I'ma bless you with forgiveness
Instead of shower you with malice

Oh, 'cause it never ends
How did it begin?
Say it never ends
Say it never ends
We got a lot, a lot, a lot to do today my friends
The energy is comin' I can feel it in the wind
I feel it in my bones, it come and goes again
For us to change the world we gotta do it from within
We got a lot, a lot, a lot to do today my friends
The energy is restless, I can feel it in the wind
I feel it in my bones, it come and goes again
