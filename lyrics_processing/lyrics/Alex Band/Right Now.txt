Called you up
In the middle of the night
Had to talk
Hear you tell me that
Everything's alright
See, I had this delusion
That I was losing you
Just a nightmare
I could have sworn it was true
Oh, what would I do?

You're all that I want and I'm not giving up on you

Right now, right now I'm here
Right now, right now you're here
Right now, holding you close to me
I know some things are meant to be

We could live along the shore
Dance across the water
Underneath the stars
I'll give you anything you want, you want
Just as long as you'll always want me
So please, just feel alive (Feel alive)
Before we run out of time
Ride the tide (Ride the tide)
And carry us into the moonlight
Do you feel like I do? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
You might also like
I've got everything that I could want now that I've got you

Right now, right now I'm here
Right now, right now you're here
Right now, holding you close to me
I see that some things are meant to be

Oh, I have fought a thousand wars
Been through Hell and knocked on Heaven's doors
We're born from the dirt of the earth
Just to love and be loved in return

(Right now)
(Right now, right now)
I'm here (Right now, right now)
You're here (Right now, right now)
I'm where I want to be (Right now, right now)
I could swim inside our love
God only knows that it's big enough
For the two of us

(Right now)
Right now, I'm where I want to be (Right now)
Right where I want to be
Right now, right now, set to sea with me
'Cause some things
