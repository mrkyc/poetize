Butterflies inside

All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm tryna get through
Keep me wonderin' why when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
'Cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
You might also like
All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', it can't be real
You're not here with me
See, but I can feel you near to me, yeah
I caress you, let you taste a just so blissful listen
I would give you anything, baby
Just make my dreams come true
Oh, baby, you give me butterflies

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

If you will take my hand, baby, I will show you
Guide you to the light, then
If you will be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you 'til the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Girl, you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I (I just wanna touch you)
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Talk to me, baby) (Inside)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna touch you)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Butterflies)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Wanna be with you) (You give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies
