Uh huh, alright...

This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter, come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold, I need someone
Oh, why oh, why, why, why...
(If you see her)
Tell her this for me
All I need is...

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(See)
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
(Alright)
One more chance at love

Searching for that one who's going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on
Lightning about to strike and rain only on me
Hurt so bad, sometimes, it's hard to breathe
Oh, why, why
(If you see her)
Tell her this from me
All I need is...

One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more chance for love)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love

And I would walk around this world to find her
And I don't care what it takes, no, why
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this from me
One more chance at love
(Yeah, yeah)
One more chance at love
(Tell her this from me) (Yeah, yeah)
One more chance at love
(Yeah, yeah)
One more chance at love
(One more chance at loving)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love
(I can't find)
One more chance at love
(Loving you) (Yeah)
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(For love)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(I can't stop) (Yeah)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(I can't stop)
One more chance at love
(Loving you) (Yeah, yeah) (Hoo!)
One more chance at love
(I can't stop)
