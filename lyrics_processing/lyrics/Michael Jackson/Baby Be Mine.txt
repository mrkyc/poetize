I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side (Ooh)
Every moment takes me to paradise
Darlin', let me hold you
I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day

So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine), ooh
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh
And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love

(Ooh)
Ooh-ooh

I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burnin' in my heart today
It's never gonna fade
You might also like
So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine), ooh
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live, oh

Won't you stay with me until the morning sun?
I promise you now that the dawn will be different
Lady, can't you see that heaven's just begun?
It's living here inside our hearts

There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl, you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say

So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine)
(Tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine (Girl, be mine, all the time)
(Show me how it should be, hold me tight)
You're everything this world could be (Every night)
The reason that I live (It's alright, every night)
Baby, be my girl (Ooh)
(Baby, be mine, tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give
(Say you're thinking of me, girl, be mine)
So baby, be mine, baby, be mine, ooh
(Show me how it should be, hold me tight)
You're everything this world could be to me
(Every night, it's alright)
C'mon, girl, c'mon, girl (Tell me that you love me all the time) Hoo! (Say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine (Show me how it should be)
You're everything this world could be to me
