Ready?
One, two, three, four

This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world, I feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know, yes, for sure, it is real

And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times
And you said you really know me, too, yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes
But you say you're gonna live it for yourself, oh!

I never heard a single word about you
Fallin' in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, baby, just understand

This is it, I can say
I'm the light of the world, runaway
We can feel this is real
Every time I'm in love, that, I feel
You might also like
And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before
And you said to me you don't want me hanging 'round
Many times, want to do it here before, oh, yeah

I never heard a single word about you
Fallin' in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, baby, just understand

This is it (This is it), I can feel (I can feel)
I'm the light of the world, this is real
Feel my song, we can say
And I tell you I feel that way

And I feel as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you want some of this yourself
And you said you want to go with me all the while
And I know that it's really true myself, oh, yeah

I never heard a single word about you
Fallin' in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, please, dear, understand (Understand)
Ah-ayy
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, please dear, understand (Understand)
Never heard a single word about you
