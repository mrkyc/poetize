There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know it's fled its tomb
Because now it's haunting me, I don't understand it!

Hey!
I don't understand it!
Aaow!

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

Got a ghost, got a break in the walls (Hey!)
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
(Don't understand it!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya?
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it, won't ya? (I'm sayin'!)
Got a ghost, got a break in the walls
Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls, gotta see it (I said)

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy
