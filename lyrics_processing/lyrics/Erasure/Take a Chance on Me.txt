If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know
And I'll be around
If you got no place to go
When you're feeling down
If you're all alone
When the pretty birds had flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best
To there ain't no lie
If you put me to the test
You could let me try

Take a chance on me (Come on, give me a break, would you?)
Take a chance on me

Oh, we can go dancing
We can go walking
As long as we are together (Together)
Listen to some music
Maybe just talking
Get to know you better
You might also like
'Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do
When I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You wanted to leave me there
Afraid of a love affair
But if you think you know......
But I can let go

If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know
And I'll be around
If you got no place to go
When you're feeling down (Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
If you're all alone
When the pretty birds had flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best
To there ain't no lie
If you put me to the test
You could let me try
Take a chance on me (It's alright, alright honey)
Take a chance on me

Oh, you could take your time baby
I'm in no hurry
I know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me
Baby don't worry
I ain't gonna let you

Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough
To last when things are rough
It's magic
You said that I waste my time
But I can't get you out of my mind
No, I can't let go
Cause I love you so

Hopping in!
If you like what you're seeing take a chance with me, ya!
You won't be grabbed if you're feeling horny
Well, you've passes so you got to know this precious property
I don't know the lads, so call me MC K
Nobody sits, understand me clearly
However hard he try, could he never own me
We all fit nice and just move freely
Special K, what he says all said carefully
Me not sit all along and just wait by phone
Not call me 'cause me never, never home ya
Machinegun as we get the wrong one
Master Mark, master Paul, mister Luke and John
If we like what we see we chance a situation
Nothing don't pay nothing, maybe see what follow on
What a jill may do if the right man come?
Hey reggae boat, come we just have a little fun!
Go now!

Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test if you let me try (Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
