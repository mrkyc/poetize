I don't wanna be the kind to hesitate
And be too shy, wait too late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just wanna dance with you
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine
So let it show, let it shine
If we have a chance to make one heart of two
And I just wanna dance with you

I wanna dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
And I just wanna dance with you

I caught you looking at me when I looked at you
Yes I did, ain't that true?
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just wanna dance with you
Oh, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
So am I and so are you
If this was a movie, we'd be right on cue
And I just wanna dance with you

I wanna dance with you
