She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up, and I said
"Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kind of like a shot"
She said, "I saw you coming over, I already thought it over and okay, so now what?"

And I said, "Well, I got a car," she said, "There's something
At least it's a start," I said, "It's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are"
And she said, "Where do you think all this is going?"
I said, "There ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car"

So we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when out of nowhere
She said, "I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kind of wish this day would never end"
She said, "I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin"

And I said, "Well, I got a car," she said, "There's something
At least it's a start," I said, "It's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are"
And she said, "Where do you think all this is going?"
I said, "There ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and the stars
But I got a car"

We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, "You know what's on the way?"
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, "I think it's time, but all the lines are out"

And her eyes teared up and she said, "What are we gonna do now?"
And I said, "Well, I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start?" I said, "It's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are"
She said, "Are you sure it'll get us where we're going?"
I said, "If there's one thing I know, girl, it's gotten us this far
