Put on black lipstick
'Cause I don't give a shit
I wish I would dye my hair pink
Put on black lipstick
No one would give a shit
Short shorts, short skirts, flower tops, denim shirts
In the big city
Nothing hurts, nothing hurts
When I was a little girl
I wanted to be a citizen of the world
Being busy with my job and my gay friends
Laughing and drinking with my one night stands
Why are you looking as if I was abnormal?
(C'mon)
It's alright, I never tried to be normal
(Uh-uh)
I just wanna walk around free on my own pace
And pay my bills with the money I make
I wish I would dye my hair pink
Put on black lipstick
No one would give a shit
Short shorts, short skirts, flower tops, denim shirts
In the big city
Nothing hurts, nothing hurts

My brother moved to New York City
I dreamed so much about being there
And live the life I didn't have yet

Hey, city girl
Yeah yeah, you city girl
Hot on heels
And how this tide turns
You live your life
To erase the lines
Of every lesson learned
So put your lipstick on
All over your teeth
'Cause you're a natural disaster
No one's gonna cheat
You swear? Yeah, I swear
Just get into the groovy
Don't live your life, girl
Unless it's just like a movie
When I was sixteen
I finally moved to the big city
My dreams were screaming at my face
Heads up girl, you can rule this place
Can rule this place
Can rule this place
Heads up girl, you can rule this place
Can rule this place
Can rule this place
