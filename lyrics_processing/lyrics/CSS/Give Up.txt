Stop!
Ok
You can press it
You can push but it will always be the same
And I've been waiting so long
Anyway... how does it feel to be free again?
I want to fall in love again
I want to feel the summer flame
You know I really want to stay
I have to go it's just getting late

Check out!
The door
I'm out!
Alright

Give up on this
Don't give up on you
Give up on me
Don't give up on us
Give up on me
Don't give up on you
Give up on this
Don't give up on us

Night are so long
Fast run the days
Chunky as a lifetime
Wrapped inside a cage
Magnification
Tasting new sensations
Body exploration
Tiny declarations
I wanna run to the milky way
How many games do we have to play?
It's a new face but it looks the same
Just send me back to Amsterdam

And if you see me crying
See me begging
See me lying
All right now!
And if you see me drinking
See me calling in the morning
Alright now (4x)

Give up on this
Don't give up on you
Give up on me
Don't give up on us
Give up on me
Don't give up on you
Give up on this
Don't give up on us
Just waking up it's weird to say
I feel I'm not still the same
Blending on the coffee
Laughing at the party
Acting like as normal
Feeling out the boredom
This time I won't make any mistakes
And you'll forget who I am
Everything changes in a day
My heart reminds it's you I crave!

And if you see me crying
See me begging
See me lying
Alright now!
And if you see me drinking
See me calling in the morning
Alright now (4x)

Life is just too serious
It won't be mysterious
Life is just too serious
It won't be mysterious
Life is just too serious
It won't be mysterious
Life is just too short
You know what it cost
Give up on this
Don't give up on you
Give up on me
Don't give up on us
Give up on me
Don't give up on you
Give up on this
