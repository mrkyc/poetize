Oh my God, it's so gold
Oh my God, I'm so messed up
I don't know which way to go
Stars above try to guess
Where's my gin, where's my glass?
All this mess comes from your ass
Fuck with us, we're CSS
We didn't come into the world to walk around
We came here to take you out
Come with us, we'll make a toast
For this time about to come
Don't mess my holiday
Don't mess my holiday
Don't mess my holiday
Don't mess my holiday
Oh my God, it's so low
Oh my God, it's so high
Ab-Fab, Claudia Ohana
Dry Martini crossed my eyes
Ask the stars what they say
Desperate living, hairspray
Baltimore with Tanqueray
Live your life John Waters' way

Patsies and Edinas
High on Vitaminas
Monday at the club
Drinking from the tub
The day starts weekend style
There's a piece of dirt in your smile
Hold your body on your legs
Your mouth is stuck to a thousand fags
We didn't come into the world to walk around
We came here to take you out
