It's been so long I heard that song
It made me sweat when I sang along
And even after all this time that went pass by
It hits me like a rock and I still don't know why
Take me on your motorcycle
Run with you through the hills
We don't care for what's wrong and what's not
I like to be with you, without a feel of what's real

But then you say we always lose our edge
But baby oh baby, is that too bad?
You know I like you a lot but

It still hits me like a rock (Ooh oooh ooh)
It still hits me like a rock (Ooh oooh ooh)
It still hits me like a rock (Ooh oooh ooh)
It still hits me like a rock (Ooh oooh ooh)

It's been so long since I heard that song
It made me cry when I sang along
And even after all this time that went pass by
It hits me like a rock and I still don't know why
You told me if we ever collide again
You would melt my brain a million times
We have too many bruises from too much kissing
And the only pain would be from too much missing

Baby baby, is that too bad?
You know I like you a lot but

It still hits me like a rock (Ooh oooh ooh)
It still hits me like a rock (Ooh oooh ooh)
It still hits me like a rock (Ooh oooh ooh)

Hits me like a rock

It's been so long I heard that song
It made me sweat all night long
(Hits me like a rock)
Still, after all this time
Hits me like a rock and I don't know why
(Hits me like a rock)

Then you said we always lose our edge
But baby oh baby, is that too bad?
You know I like you a lot but

Rock, rock, rock (Ooh oooh ooh)

Rock, rock, rock (Ooh oooh ooh)
Hits me like a rock (Hits me like a rock)
Rock, rock, rock (Ooh oooh ooh)
