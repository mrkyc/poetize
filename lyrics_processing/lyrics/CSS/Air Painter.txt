Tell me your stories, write down your secrets
And play this music as loud as can be
Get me a sandwich, buy me some hot tea
And sing this song as loud as can be
Teach me poker, dance with me slowly
And play this music as loud as can be
Open the window, draw down the curtains
And sing this song as loud as can be

I live on the moon
Like a cartoon
Maybe I can see myself in you
Yes! I want to see myself in you
Oh it's so great!
No it's not
Yes it is all great
It happens to everyone
If you think about it, it starts at a young age

Tell me your stories, write down your secrets
And play this music as loud as can be
Get me a sandwich, buy me some hot tea
And sing this song as loud as can be
Teach me poker, dance with me slowly
And play this music as loud as can be
Open the window, draw down the curtains
And sing this song as loud as can be

Jumping in the pool
Swimming in the cool
I ain't gonna swim at the speed of sound
I ain't gonna climb the walls... No, no!
It will take more than a day to change
It will take more than a thousand pens and papers to let go, to grow
So much crap!

Tell me a story, write down a secret
Buy me a sandwich, get me some hot tea
Speak in your language, turn off the TV
Make me a drawing, cook me welsh rare bits
Send me a postcard, write me a letter
And sing this song as loud as it can be

I'm a black eyed raccoon
Working from the moon
I look back and all I did was blank
Not there, never there
It was all a dream
A brain fantasy
To much hope tricking me
Drawing smiles on my face
Drawing your face on my face
I miss you
Tell me your stories, write down your secrets
And play this music as loud as can be
Get me a sandwich, buy me some hot tea
And sing this song as loud as can be
Teach me poker, dance with me slowly
And play this music as loud as can be
Open the window, draw down the curtains
And sing this song as loud as can be
And sing this song as loud as can be
