Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah

So soon, we'll learn to forget
Bad times, the rules, and regrets
One day, they won't reach out for you

So you put out the fires you set
As smoke fades from your last cigarette
You're a mess, but, yes, you're beautiful

Oh, come on down, we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now, we can't drown in this water
You've been praying for a remedy

Who really cares about fatal mistakes?
Trailer park dreams don't carry much weight
In the long run, you've got nothing to prove
You might also like
So go, run while you can still get away
Take a breath while it's still yours to take
You're a mess, but, yes, you're beautiful

Oh, come on down, we can't drown in this water (Water)
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now, we can't drown in this water (Water)
You've been praying for a remedy

Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah (You've been praying for a remedy)
Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah (You've been praying for a remedy)

Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah
Oh, oh-oh yeah, oh, oh-oh yeah
So who really cares if you make a mistake?

Oh, come on down, we can't drown in this water (Water)
It's only gonna set us free
Come on now, we can't drown in this water (Water)
You've been praying for a remedy
Oh, come on down, we can't drown in this water
It's only gonna set us free
Come on down, you know that you want it
