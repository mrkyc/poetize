I know your name but it won't come out
If there's a way to believe, I can't feel a thing
I'm free as a bird with a broken wing
Maybe I built this house just to burn it down
From the ashes I shall wear a crown
'Cause I'm, I'm the king of broken hearts
Maybe the cross I bear is one I made
It's my choice maybe my mistake
Oh I'm, I'm the king of broken hearts
No, I won't cry, won't shed a tear
A bitter man stand free and clear
If this is release, why can't I feel a thing?
I'm here again nowhere but somehow in between
Maybe I built this house just to burn it down
From the ashes I shall wear a crown
'Cause I'm, I'm the king of broken hearts
Maybe the cross I bear is one I made
It's my choice maybe my mistake
Oh I'm, I'm the king of broken hearts
The one who lives in this useless heart
What part of this journey have I overlooked?
A useless martyr and no sense of shame
Doesn't have anything mean everything?

I play this part
Over and over, and over and over, and over again
I play this part
Over and over, and over and over, and over again
Maybe I built this house just to burn it down
From the ashes I shall wear a crown
'Cause I'm, I'm the king of broken hearts
(I'm the king of broken hearts)
Maybe I built this house just to burn it down
From the ashes I shall wear a crown
'Cause I'm, I'm the king of broken hearts
Maybe the cross I bear is one I made
It's my choice maybe my mistake
