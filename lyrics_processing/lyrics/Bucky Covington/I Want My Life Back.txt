And pourin' in whiskey
As I walked up, he never blinked an eye
He just asked for a light
I noticed he didn't have soles on his shoes
So I pulled out a twenty, said go buy some food
But he just stared at his cup like I wasn't there
Then he looked at me, said son that's nice
But there's some things money can't buy
I want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want that job I worked for 22 years before I got laid off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and that man I used to be
I want my life back
I walked through the door and sat down at the bar
Had a shot and a beer, lit up a cigar
It ran through my head, every word that old man said
I had a woman that loved me with all of her heart
But my pride and my temper made it all fall apart
I was too headstrong to admit when I was wrong
It's been 6 months since she moved out
Guess my pride ain't helping me now
You might also likeI want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want to hear her voice and see her face every day when I get off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and that man I used to be
I want my life back
I paid my tab and left that bar
I grabbed my phone, jumped in my car
I dialed her number and when she said hello, I said
I want my life back, I want that house that I called home
I want to hear your voice and see your face every day when I get off
I want what I had when I laid down in the arms
Of the woman that believed in me and the man I used to be
