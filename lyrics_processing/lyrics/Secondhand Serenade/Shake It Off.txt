Your coffee cup is empty and your bills went through the roof
Cause looking at the good life isn't in the cards for you
You need a cheat sheet on this never ending test
You got the key and lost it and now you left a second guess
Waiting on the love that hasn't found you yet, no
If you feel so alone, let it go
Come on
Just shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
You gotta gotta wake up
Show them what you're made of
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
You gotta gotta stand up
Gotta throw your hands up
Just shake it off
She's a dynamite girl and she smiles as she waves
You take it as a compliment then take a double take
Her eyes are on the guy a few tables away
When your dollar give a friend for telling you're around
Catching up cannot in this senseless college town
Bet you wish you knew what they were doing now
If you feel alone, now
Come on, let it go
Just shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
You gotta gotta wake up
Show them what you're made of
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
You gotta gotta stand up
Gotta throw your hands up
It's only phase
Walking on a thin line you're gunna see
That these are the days
You got to take a second, remember to breathe
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Just shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Just shake it off
(Go!)
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
You gotta gotta wake up
Show them what you're made of
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
You gotta gotta stand up
Gotta throw your hands up
(You've got to shake it off, shake it off)
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
You gotta gotta wake up
Show them what you're made of
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
Shake shake, shake it off
You gotta gotta stand up
Gotta throw your hands up
(You've got to shake it off, shake it off)
