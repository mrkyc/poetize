To all the things that you have ever known
You can say goodbye
And leave behind the life that you have grown
What's the point
You try to start from scratch but get let down
You can say goodbye
Just to realize there's no-one left around
So what am I fighting for
Tell me
Is there anybody out there
Am I swimming through this empty sea alone
Am I looking for an answer
Or am I trying to find a way to get back home
Is there anybody out there
Would you hear me if I screamed or if I cried
I'm looking for an answer
And just trying to find a way to survive
You can live and die
Without the chance to find out what you're worth
You can live and die
And never find the one that you deserve
You can walk alone
And live inside the shadows in your heart
You can say goodbye
Only to find out you've been alone right from the start
So what am I fighting for

Would you hear me if I screamed or if I cried
I am looking for an answer
And just trying to find a way to survive
Never thought that I would end up all alone
Every day I'm feeling further away from home
I can't catch my breath but I'm holding on
Is there anybody out there
Is this the last time I have to say goodbye
Am I staring at my future
Is it time to take charge of my life
Is there anybody out there
Am I swimming through this empty sea alone
Am I looking for an answer
Or am I trying to find a way to get back home
Is there anybody out there
Would you hear me if I screamed or if I cried
I am looking for an answer
And just trying to find a way to survive
A way to survive
