Played a thousand shows, seas of blank faces
Nothing came to focus til I set my sights on you
Something about a guy with a guitar
The way that you strum to the beat of my heart
Nothing struck a chord with me quite like you do
You've got me feeling like I'm in love
Sweet like sugar, can't get enough
Meet me on the corner of, together and forever
You got me, dizzy like a record machine
Wake me up like a coffee bean
You've got my head up in the clouds above
You've got me feeling like I'm in love
La la la la love, la la la la love, la la la la love
The way you're nod your head when you're not paying attention
The way you chew your gum in a writing session
Lights up the day like the burning desert sun
You always laugh at me when I try to be clever
That's because I think that you're the cutest thing ever
Loving you is easy when we're always having fun
You've got me feeling like I'm in love
Sweet like sugar, can't get enough
Meet me on the corner of, together and forever
You got me, dizzy like a record machine
Wake me up like a coffee bean
You've got my head up in the clouds above
You've got me feeling like I'm in love
La la la la love, la la la la love, la la la la love
