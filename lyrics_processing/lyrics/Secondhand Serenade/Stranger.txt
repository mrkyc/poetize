Turn around and fix your eye in my direction
So there is a connection
I can't speak
I can't make a sound to somehow capture your attention
I'm staring at perfection
Take a look at me so you can see
How beautiful you are
You call me a stranger
You say I'm a danger
But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight
I'm broke and abandoned
You are an angel
Making all my dreams come true tonight
I'm confident
But I can't pretend I wasn't terrified to meet you
I knew you could see right through me
I saw my life flash right before my very eyes
And I knew just what we'd turn into
I was hoping that you could see
Take a look at me so you can see
How beautiful you are
You call me a stranger
You say I'm a danger
But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight
I'm broke and abandoned
You are an angel
Making all my dreams come true tonight
You are an angel
Making all my dreams come true tonight

How beautiful you are
Take a look at me so you can see
How beautiful you are
Your beauty seems so far away
I'd have to write a thousand songs to make you
Comprehend how beautiful you are
I know that I can't make you stay
But I would give
My final breathe to make you understand how beautiful you are
Understand how beautiful you are
You call me a stranger
You say I'm a danger
But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight
I'm broke and abandoned
You are an angel
Making all my dreams come true tonight
You call me a stranger
You say I'm a danger
You call me a stranger
