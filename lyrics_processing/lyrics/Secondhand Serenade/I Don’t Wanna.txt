But I know you're lying to me
I state my case, even in our perfect place
There's nothing I can do to make you believe
Cause I don't wanna run, don't wanna hide
I don't want to feel like I do tonight
I don't wanna say that I'll be alright
Cause loving is the only thing that gets me by
I don't wanna bend, don't wanna break
I don't know how much more of this I can take
I don't wanna love, you know it's true
If I have to learn to love anyone but you
We drive around to get lost but we get found
These roads are paved with the truth
And if only once you told me
That I mean more than the words that it says
I'd say that these words don't love you, I do
I don't wanna run, don't wanna hide
I don't want to feel like I do tonight
I don't wanna say that I'll be alright
Cause loving is the only thing that gets me by
I don't wanna bend, don't wanna break
I don't know how much more of this I can take
I don't wanna love, you know it's true
If I have to learn to love anyone but you

For a love that's not enough
But all my heart, I'll give you for free
Don't wanna run, don't wanna hide
Don't wanna say that I'll be alright
I don't wanna run, don't wanna hide
