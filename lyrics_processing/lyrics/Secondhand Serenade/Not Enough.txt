Fighting in the street
Screaming things we didn't mean
You held on as I let go
All our dreams went up in smoke
As I lost a part of me

And I know you moved on from
Where I left you
But I guess it won't hurt too much to ask you

What if I said I want you to come back? (Not enough)
And baby all we need is one last chance (Not enough)
That I made a mistake by leaving you standing there
In the pouring rain
Is there anything I could say
That would ever be enough?
Are we not enough? Not enough

Right outside of Nashville
We fell hard like every young love will
You held on and so did I
All of our dreams came alive
That night the world stood still

But I know you moved on from
Where I left you
And I didn't know it would hurt so much
To ask you

What If I said I want you to come back? (Not enough)
And baby all we need is one last chance (Not enough)
That I made a mistake
By leaving you standing there in the pouring rain
Is there anything I could say
That would ever be enough?
Are we not enough? Not enough

Out of sight
Out of reach
You're out of words to say to me
Out of fight
Out of touch
When did we become not enough?
Out of sight
Out of reach
You're out of words to say to me
Out of fight
Out of touch
When did we become not enough?
What If I said I want you to come back? (Not enough)
And baby all we need is one last chance (Not enough)
That I made a mistake
By leaving you standing there in the pouring rain
Is there anything I could say
That would ever be enough?
