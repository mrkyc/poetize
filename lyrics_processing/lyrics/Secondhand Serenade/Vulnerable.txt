Share with me the blankets that you're wrapped in
Because it's cold outside (Cold outside),  it's cold outside
(It's cold outside)
Share with me the secrets that you kept in
Because it's cold inside (Cold inside), it's cold inside
(It's cold inside)

And your slow shaking finger tips show
That you're scared like me so
Let's pretend we're alone
And I know you may be scared
And I know we're unprepared
But I don't care

Tell me, tell me
What makes you think that you are invincible?
I can see it in your eyes that you're so sure
Please don't tell me that I'm the only one that's vulnerable
Impossible

I was born to tell you I love you
Isn't that a song already?
(isn't that a song already?)
I get a B in originality
And it's true I can't go on without you
Your smile makes me see clearer
If you could only see in the mirror what I see

Slow down girl, you're not going anywhere
Just wait around and see
Maybe I'm much more
You never know what lies ahead
I promise I can be anyone, I can be anything
Just because you were hurt doesn't mean you shouldn't bleed
I can be anyone, anything
I promise I can be what you need
(I can be what you need)
Tell me, tell me

I can see it in your eyes that you're so sure
