But I've never been in front of anything like you
It's the last place I ever thought I'd be
When I woke up this morning
Is it true that you're always this breath-taking?
And you're smart and you're willing
My God this is killing me
Tell me all the things you never said
We could lie here and talk for hours in my bed
I don't have anything to hide
I don't have anything
Everything is not for certain
I don't have anything to hide
I don't have anything
Everything is not for certain
You're starting to see right through me
And I'm loving every minute of it
It's like I'm born again, every time I breathe in so...
If you're curious, my favourite colour's blue
And I like to sing in the shower
If you like I'll sing to you

Tell me all of your hopes, all of your dreams
I want you to take me there
(take me there)
Tell me all of your hopes, all of your dreams
I want to take you there
(take you there)
Tell me everything, every breath
I want you to know I'll be there
There's just one more thing, one request
I want you to take me with you
Take me with you
I will never let you down
I will love you now and forever
Take me with you
I will never let you down
I will love you now and forever
(now and forever)
Take me with you
I will never let you down
(now and forever)
I will love you now and forever
