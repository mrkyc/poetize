For you just to believe that I've got nothing up my sleeve
I'm here to stay
But my hopes are shrinking with each and every single day
Then I wake up minus one
I've had enough this isn't fun, let's run away
You bring me sunshine wherever I go
You are the fire when I feel cold
When I'm asleep you're in my dreams
Come back to me, come back to me, darling
I'm not denying
That you're the perfect kind of girl for me
When I'm with you, I can't breathe
My heart is falling off my sleeve
My knees are weak
So let's get going, we've got places to see
Let's get to living if you're willing
Bring it back just like Bob Dylan, don't you see
You bring me sunshine wherever I go
You are the fire when I feel cold
When I'm asleep you're in my dreams
Come back to me, come back to me
You make the clouds roll off with your smile
If love is the fashion, then I like your style
They  say no but we say si
Come back to me, come back to me, darling

This is our chance so say yes
There are no maybes
This could be our way out, don't you see
I am down on my knee
This is the way I show you I care
When I am alone and you are not there
I write this song to you, no one compares
I wish you'd see, come back to me
You bring me sunshine wherever I go
You are the fire when I feel cold
When I'm asleep you're in my dreams
Come back to me, come back to me
You make the clouds roll off with your smile
If love is the fashion, then I like your style
They say no but we say si
Come back to me, come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
