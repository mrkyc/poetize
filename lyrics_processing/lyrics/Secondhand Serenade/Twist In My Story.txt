It's safe to say we are alone now, we're alone now
Not a whisper, the only noise is the receiver
I'm counting the seconds until you break the silence
So please just break the silence
The whispers turn to shouting
The shouting turns to tears
Your tears turned into laughter
And it takes away our fears
So you see, this world doesn't matter to me
I'll give up all I have just to breathe
The same air as you till the day that I die
I can't take my eyes off you
I'm longing for words to describe how I'm feeling
I'm feeling inspired, my world just flipped, turned upside down
And turned around, say, what's that sound?
It's my heartbeat, it's getting much louder
My heartbeat is stronger than ever
I'm feeling so alive, I'm feeling so alive
The whispers turn to shouting
The shouting turns to tears
Your tears turned into laughter
And it takes away our fears
