I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Workin' your back like, it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now, girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
Got an obsession, of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission, so

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
We could go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now (Let's go!)

So I went hard like Medusa starin at me
I told her, "Let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory"
She said, "What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want, 'cause you some kind of star"
No, I'm a comet, I just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then, it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, "Ooh, he can get it"
Admit it, you did it, let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kidding, we both goin' to where you livin'
Ha, I got you gigglin' like a piglet, oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it
I'm just stylefreein', freestylin' which I seldom do
This is what I'm tellin' you, to the bed I'm nailin' you (I'm ready to go right now)
Like I've been in jail for two, years and then they let me loose (I'm ready to go right now)
Give me the green light (You got you one, Legend)
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now (Sometimes you gotta step from behind that piano)
I'm ready to go right now (And let 'em know what's going on)
Give me the green light (Even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes, haha)
I'm ready to go right now (I'm ready to go, my mandate can't wait)
I'm ready to go right now (Participate)
