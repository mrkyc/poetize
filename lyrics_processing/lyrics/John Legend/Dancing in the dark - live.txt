And I ain't got nothing to say
Come on in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I am nothing but tired
Mand I'm just tired and bored of myself
Hey there baby
I could use just a little love
You can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for fire
Even if we are just dancing in the dark
Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving around the place
I check my look in the mirror
Want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know there is
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up, all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here, trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on, baby, give me just one look
You can't start a fire
Sitting around crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
