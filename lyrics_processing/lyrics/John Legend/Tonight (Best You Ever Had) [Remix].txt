Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came more?
Girl what you playin' for?
Come on
Come on, let me kiss that
Oooh, know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that
Twist that

Baby, tonight's the night I let you go
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag but I'll be
The best you ever had

I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and the breast stroke
'Til you're blowin' cigarette smoke
And now the beds broke
So what we gon' do now?
Fuck it, Round Two now
Work it out then we cool down

Baby, tonight's the night I let you go
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag but I'll be
The best you ever had

Might not pull your chair out
Calendars I clear out
No relaxers, I pay to grow your hair out
His and her everything pull 'em pairs out
Them pink pink Louboutin's, pull them reds out
Never sweat airfare when the lear's near
Through the clouds sky blue like a care bear
Your first time you a virgin to these airlines
I don't mean to brag but compare mine
Roadsters, chauffeurs, take your pick
Have your cake and eat it too, baby, make a wish
Anything you ever wanted you could make a list
The only reason you ain't got it 'cuz it don't exist
Took a chance, hit or miss
Homerun, friends with benefits
We fight and make love I like you better mad
Truly yours, "the best you ever had"
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know (Baby, tonight)
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had (Be the best you ever had)
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be (I don't wanna brag)
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
