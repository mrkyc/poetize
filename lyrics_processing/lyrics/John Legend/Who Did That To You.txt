Now I'm not afraid to do the Lord's work
You said vengeance is His, but I'ma do it first
I'm gon' handle my business in the name of the law (ohh)
Now if he made you cry, oh, I gotta know
If he's not ready to die, he best prepare for it
My judgement's divine, I'll tell you who you can call
You can call

You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah
Who did that to you, my baby
Who did that to you
Gotta find that fool who did that to you

Now I don't take pleasure in a man's pain
But my wrath will come down like the cold rain
And there won't be no shelter, no place you can go
It's time to put your hands up, time for surrender
I'm a vigilante, my love's defender
You're a wanted man, here everybody knows

You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah
Who did that to you, my baby
Who did that to you
Gotta find that fool who did that to you

Now he'll keep on running, but I'm closing in
I hunt him down until the bitter end
If you see me coming man, who're you gonna call?

You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
You better call the doctor, call the lawyer
I chased him all away to California
Did my best trying to find that fool
