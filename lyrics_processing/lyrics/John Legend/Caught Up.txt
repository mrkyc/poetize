I'm so, excited
I'm home, been grindin'
Let's go, tonight
Just make some money you know
I got it, if you want it
If you love it
I'm on it, I'm on it
So come on it
I need your loving tonight

I'm tired of my job
I'm tired of my boss
I'm taking you out
Your taking it off
Only thing on my mind is how we bout to get it on

I wanna get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe
I'm tryin' to get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe
