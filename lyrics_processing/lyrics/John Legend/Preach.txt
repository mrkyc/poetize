Every day I wake and everything is broken
Turnin' off my phone just to get out of bed
Get home every evenin' and history's repeatin'
Turnin' off my phone 'cause it's hurtin' my chest
Hey

And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah
But what can I do?
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

All I hear is voices, everybody's talkin'
Nothin' real is happenin' 'cause nothing is new
Now, when all this tragic, and I just feel sedated
Why do I feel numb? Is that all I can do? Yeah

I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe (Though I do believe)
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
I try to do the things I say that I believe (I do believe)
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
