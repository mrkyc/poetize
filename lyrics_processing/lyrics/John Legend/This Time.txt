Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
Its starting to hit me
Now you're not with me
I realized I made a mistake
Thought that I needed some space
I just let love go to waste
Its so crystal clear now
That I need you here now
Got to get you back today

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
Its not like I planned it
But left empty handed
Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight
Is there someone new now
What can I do now
Cause I need you back by my side

This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

Last time I wasn't sure
This time I will give you more
I'm more than sure
I'll show you
Last time I didn't know
I messed up when I let you go
I need you, don't say no

Lying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Won't you come home

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
