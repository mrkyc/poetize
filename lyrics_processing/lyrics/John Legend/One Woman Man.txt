I always believed that love was surrender
And I wouldn't go down without a fight
I always left room for other contenders
'Cause I might change my mind

Damn, I used to be so cold
Would never ever get too close
Didn't ever wanna lose control
But from the moment that I tasted
I knew that I would have to chase it
You said hold up, I want you to be

A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
Want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All your loving
All or nothing
Won't you be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, oh (one woman)

You made me believe that love was forever
And love could sustain us through every fight
I let go of all of the other pretenders
They were wasting my time

I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the start
That I might give you my heart
From the moment that I met you
Knew that I would never let you
Slip away, it's okay
You can make me

A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing
I can be
A one woman man (One woman)
A one woman man, uh (One woman)

I could never say I loved you
I kept up my guard
But you broke in my house
You've stolen my heart
Now I've given you the key
Got all of you for all of me
But baby, I promise to be
A one woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing
I can be
A one woman man (One woman)
