It gets harder everyday
But I can't seem to shake the pain
I'm trying to find the words to say, please stay
It's written all over my face
That I can't function the same when you're not here
Calling your name and no one's there

And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

I don't care what people say
They're probably lonely anyway
Baby don't fill up your head with he-said, she-said
It seems like you just don't know. (Don't know)
The radio's on, you're tuning me out
I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down

And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

Oh I wish you would understand
Just an ordinary man
I wish that we have known
That everybody knows, that nobody really knows

And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
