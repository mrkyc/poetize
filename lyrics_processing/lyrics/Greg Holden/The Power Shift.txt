I can hear the engine screaming
But it is way down the road
Not gonna sit here and wait
For someone to guide me home
The lights burn out and it's dark out here
Something is going on, but in the end

I know I'm not alone
There are millions of us down in this rabbit hole
Millions of us losing our self control
Millions of us with nowhere else to go

So keep moving forward now
Let the people going backwards find their own way out
Keep looking up, my friends
Let the people looking down on you never forget
We see your bullshit, all of it
I hope you're ready for the power shift
(I hope you're ready for it)
We see your bullshit, all of it
I hope you're ready for the power shift

I can feel the tables turning
And if you open your eyes
You will see your castle burning
Oh, what a pleasant surprise
How does it feel being the one in need?
Reaching out your arms when you realize
You might also like
You're on your own
With the millions of us you put into this hole
The millions of us you thought you could control
The millions of us with nowhere else to go

So keep moving forward now
Let the people going backwards find their own way out
Keep looking up, my friends
Let the people looking down on you never forget
We see your bullshit, all of it
I hope you're ready for the power shift
(I hope you're ready for it)
We see your bullshit, all of it
I hope you're ready for the power shift

We see your bullshit, all of it
I hope you're ready for the power shift
(I hope you're ready for it)
We see your bullshit, all of it
I hope you're ready for the power shift

So keep moving forward now
Let the people going backwards find their own way out
Keep looking up, my friends
Let the people looking down on you never forget, yeah
We see your bullshit, all of it
I hope you're ready for the power shift
(I hope you're ready for it)
We see your bullshit, all of it
