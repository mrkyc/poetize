I can see my place on a nowhere road
Where the stars shine bright and the skies hang low
I can watch, I can drink, I will not have to think for tomorrow
I can dream of a time when my worries are gone
I can hope for a day where nothing goes wrong
But the truth of it is is we never really let go of wanting

You've gotta give it away, you don't need it
Just give it away, what's the point of it?
Just give it away, it is not worth the headache

I can talk all day 'bout the way that I've changed
I can send my money to a 3rd world place
But it don't mean a thing if my intention's are not getting purer
We can preach all we like of the things we have read
But at the end of the day, it's just a quote in our head
No we won't ever know how it's all gonna go, will we really?
No

You've gotta give it away, you don't need it
Just give it away, what's the point of it?
Just give it away, it is not worth the headache

Just give it away, it is not worth the headache
Just give it away, you don't need it
Just give it away, what's the point of it?
Just give it away, it is not worth the headache
Just give it away, you don't need it
Just give it away, what's the point of it?
Just give it away, it is not worth the headache
Just give it away, you don't need it
Just give it away, what's the point of it?
