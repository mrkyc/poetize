You've been digging like an old miner from a different time Searching through the rubble and coal to find something to fill your soul

Well it all comes out, you were getting paid
Living in the dark for a minimum wage
The stories gone but the message stays
Just like a fire it'll burn away

Yeah, it's true
Everything you know will be leaving you
Someday soon
So don't go thinking you're bulletproof
See this through
If you learn to trust what love can do
You will find there's more to life than you

Prophets come and go and like scared sheep, we follow
Into the wildfire, we go deep-ly sinking into their greed

And when it all come out they were getting paid
To break our hearts for a minimum wage
You better learn your lesson and walk away
Cause sometimes people aren't what they say
You might also like
Yeah, it's true
Everything you know will be leaving you
Someday soon
So don't go thinking you're bulletproof
See this through
If you learn to trust what love can do
You will find there's more to life than you
You will find there's more to life than you
You will find there's more to life than you
You will find there's more to life than you

Yeah, it's true
Everything you know will be leaving you
Someday soon
So don't go thinking you're bulletproof

Yeah, it's true
Everything you know will be leaving you
Someday soon
So don't go thinking you're bulletproof
See this through
If you learn to trust what love can do
You will find there's more to life than you
You will find there's more to life than you
You will find there's more to life than you, than you
You will find there's more to life than you
You will find there's more to life than you
