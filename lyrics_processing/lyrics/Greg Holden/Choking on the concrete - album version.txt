I've got nothing I can offer you as I sit here in the cold
And it's a story I've been telling for longer than I know
Sorry I'm not out tonight, my pockets feel like old
I've got nothing I can offer you as I sit here in the cold
And it's a story I've been telling for longer than I know
Where did all my riches go
An inquest I am scared of cause I don't want to know
And I've been walking off my worries
Hoping they won't follow me round and round and round
But they always find me, and I said why won't you leave me alone
Why won't you leave me alone
I'm terrified of answers so I choose just not to ask
Surely everything is easier when you leave it in the past
And I know that I won't be waking almost every single night
Dripping wet with deep regret locked in this sadness fight
And I am falling faster to the ground
Punched at every corner with my arms securely bound
And I am waiting for existence to hold me by the hand
Explain that all's not lost for me and make me understand that I am free
Make me understand that I am free
Make me understand that I am free
Make me understand that I am free
Make me understand
You might also likeMy panic gets the upper hand as it tackles with my breath
And I can see this is no playground fight it's a battle to the death
And I am choking on the concrete with my face pressed to the floor
The bastards won't defeat me, can't you hear me scream for more
And I am falling faster to the ground
Punched at every corner with my arms securely bound
And I am waiting for existence to hold me by the hand
Explain that all's not lost for me and make me understand that I am free
Make me understand that I am free
Make me understand that I am free
Make me understand that I am free
