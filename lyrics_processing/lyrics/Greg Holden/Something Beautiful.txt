I'm not gonna ask you to listen to me
I'm not trying to tell you now who you should be
I'm just delirious from losing my sleep
And in all of those hours that I lay awake
Staring at something that gets in the way
I see a reason for all our mistakes
And how everything changed

We all got used to the hit and run
Never wanna face the damage we've done
You can bury all your bones
But they're gonna follow you home

So if you're gonna open your mouth, say something beautiful
What you put out will always come back to you
Every word counts, so say something beautiful
If you're gonna open your doors, be open to anyone
What's it all for if you can't love everyone?
Mean every word and say something beautiful
Say something beautiful

Everyone everywhere wants to be first
Just 'cause we scream doesn't mean we'll be heard
We'd all play our part, we're so unrehearsed
Will anything change?
