I know I get a little down
Make a mess sometimes
But I am getting better now
Now that you're on my side

I know there's something about this
I know there's something about this
And I am lucky that you stuck around
I'll do it right this time

But baby, I am sorry
For the things I've done (For the things I've done)
I know it wasn't easy
When I was on the run (When I was on the run)
But you've gotta take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
'Cause, baby, I am sorry for the things I've done

And I know I get a little loud
Make a fool of myself
But I am gonna quiet down
Take control of my health

I know there's something about this
I know there's something about this
And I am lucky that you stuck around
'Cause I wouldn't be here now

But baby, I am sorry
For the things I've done (For the things I've done)
I know it wasn't easy
When I was on the run (When I was on the run)
But you've gotta take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
'Cause, baby, I am sorry for the things I've done

I know there's something about this
I know there's something about this
I know there's something about this
I know there's something about this
I know there's something about this

But baby, I am sorry
(I know there's something about this)
For the things I've done
(I know there's something about this)
Yeah, and I know it wasn't easy
(I know there's something about this)
When I was on the run (When I was on the run)
(I know there's something about this)
(I know there's something about this)
But you've gotta take me back, take me back
(I know there's something about this)
Take me back, take me back
(I know there's something about this)
'Cause, baby, I am sorry for the things I've done

(I know there's something about this)
Yeah, and baby, I am sorry for the things I've done
(I know there's something about this)

And I know it wasn't easy when I was on the run
