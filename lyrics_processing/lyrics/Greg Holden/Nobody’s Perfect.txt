I thought I had to change
To be something better, get rid of the shame
I thought I was the only one, thought I was unique
I'm the same as anyone feeling incomplete
Heavy is the weight of what we put upon ourselves

Maybe nobody's perfect
And maybe under the surface
We're all just trying to figure out
How to believe in a world of doubt
And everybody needs saving
Tell me I'm not going crazy
I'm just trying to work it out
We're all just trying to work it out

What makes us beautiful?
Is it the darkness or is it the light
I thought I was the only one staring at myself
Wishing I was different like everybody else
Heavy is the weight of all the choices that we make

Maybe nobody's perfect
And maybe under the surface
We're all just trying to figure out
How to believe in a world of doubt
And everybody needs saving
Tell me I'm not going crazy
I'm just trying to work it out
We're all just trying to work it out
You might also like
And maybe nobody's perfect
For all I know it could all be wrong
Days are short and nights are long
Memories are all but gone
Now I may not understand it
I'll never know if the things I see
Would ever feel so real to me
But who cares if they're real to me?

Well, maybe nobody's perfect
And maybe under the surface
We're all just trying to figure out
How to believe in a world of doubt
And everybody needs saving
Tell me I'm not going crazy
I'm just trying to work it out
We're all just trying to work it out
Maybe nobody's perfect

And maybe nobody's perfect
Maybe nobody's perfect
We're all just trying to work it out
We're all just trying to work it out
Maybe nobody's perfect
We're all just trying to work it out
We're all just trying to work it out
Maybe nobody's perfect
We're all just trying to work it out
We're all just trying to work it out
We're all just trying to work it out
