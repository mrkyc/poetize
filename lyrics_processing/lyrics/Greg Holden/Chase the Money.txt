Empty words taking the weight out of
All the things that we say that we care about
I don't even know what it means now
I don't even know what it means
I remember the way that we used to react
Giving it out without needing it back

Chase the money, chase, chase the money
We talk a lot about saving the world, but we
Chase the money, chase the money

Taste the money, taste, taste the money
The more we get, the more we want

Do we even know what it means now?
Do we even know what it means
To be open enough, to be ready to change
Get into the thing that could get in the way
Again and again, there is nothing to say
When it all comes down to it

Taste the money, taste, taste the money
The more we get, the more we want
So we chase the money, chase the money

And if it all comes down to this
Will we all see through it? Oh
And if it all comes down to this

Oh, we just chase the money, chase, chase the money
Chase the money, chase, chase the money
We talk a lot about saving the world, but we
Chase the money, chase the money
We can taste the money, taste, taste the money
Taste the money, taste, taste the money
The more we get, the more we want
So we chase the money, chase the money
We can chase the money, chase, chase the money
Chase the money, chase, chase the money
We talk a lot about saving the world, but we
