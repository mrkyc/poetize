Came in the world in so cold
But it doesn't matter thats all
Dreamed to be so popular
But didn't got any role
Hanging here and there
Holding my aims in pair
What kind of shit he said
Broken my heart he left
Couple of days ago
I'm unable to show the whole
My fist come to end
But didn't happen when lend
Listen my friendz
It was my best friend Fali Shah
Who hold me and set my fans
I'm unable to enhance the words I hear
These were off to my sense
Pretended to be the one who love how ever it ends
I turned my back to the world
And stuck in Rapping cruel
Is this my aim is about
No I didn't mean to hide
Probably exploring the history to find my peace full life
Now in these days I'm thinking to sell my records hive
But didn't got the submission
That's why I didn't survive
You might also like

Look what I say I decided to be lie
But never get the crowd back into my life
I didn't mean I was lefting you around
Its just feel like I'm shouting underground
Look what I say I decided to be lie
But never get the crowd back into my life
I didn't mean I was lefting you around
Its just feel like I'm shouting underground


Now lets cheer on it
Make up here on it
My first rap was published
So just chill from it
Hating this way don't lie
But I recognised the word
He said
(That you can't rap clap)
I didn't stop this thing
Cause I was on the list
It was my passion What can be it is
So loosing enough energy and spending some time
I finally smashes my second rap on his face with the shit all around
With a new pace a new style
I haven't forgot his face
It was lie down  That's all
No Think about it I feel so guilty
What have I done please dont make
What is I am please forgive me
I am your best friend
And he did the same
He makes me his friend with my name
Its shame to me what I have aimed
What I was thinking what he was
Trusted me added to me his group
Thus I was nuts  Yeah Sluts


Look what I say I decided to be lie
But never get the crowd back into my life
I didn't mean I was lefting you around
Its just feel like I'm shouting underground
Look what I say I decided to be lie
But never get the crowd back into my life
I didn't mean I was lefting you around
Its just feel like I'm shouting underground

I was being happy and chill
Didn't taked another pill
My time was up I have to kill
Murder a verse I was standing still
Didn't even said everyone chill
They making fun of me and I'm in the thrill
Record I have sighned to was not my will
Filling a form was nothing hell
I made my self calm
Nothing in my arms
I stand to face the crowd
It was too loud
No one listen's to me
Anything I said It was me
I was being selfish or not
Nothing comes out of my heart
I was dischared
I didn't believe I was a part
A hip hop rap
I wrote a flack
Started to get my faith back
Come with another rap
But look what I saw
The crowd were gone so far
And I'm still sitting in my empty yard


Look what I say I decided to be lie
But never get the crowd back into my life
I didn't mean I was lefting you around
Its just feel like I'm shouting underground
Look what I say I decided to be lie
But never get the crowd back into my life
I didn't mean I was lefting you around
Its just feel like I'm shouting underground
Look what I say I decided to be lie
But never get the crowd back into my life
I didn't mean I was lefting you around
Its just feel like I'm shouting underground
Look what I say I decided to be lie
But never get the crowd back into my life
I didn't mean I was lefting you around
