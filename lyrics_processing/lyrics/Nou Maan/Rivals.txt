For the first time you ever see
Wait a minute Where's Beat
Beat Please
For the first time you ever see
Nou Maan vs Nomi Boy
Let see who will win this battle
Nou Maan 
You've maded you sighn
You've created your name
NB isn't even a shit
What is its full form
Do you know even a single hey
Nasty Bitch you say that back in the day's
Or it's stands for Northern Buster
Its your sign no non of my cluster
Alright I have a point for you say
You called your self a gangster now in the day's
Sick of you'r grey's
Praise singers what the fuck with you hey
Obey the rules I have stolen from dre
Eminem killed by Eminem that's the fact gay
Wroting in English non of you languages ray
Your a Pakistani not a brownie pay
Attention on you self aday
What is the hell behind this tell me Hey
You might also like
Nomi Boy 
Haha Nou Maan
Your being sorty aday's
It reminds me when I invade
Myself in front of whole world said
Leave this point come on the main end
When you tend to make a trend
Defend your friends
Away from the point where it lands
Ok your pointing at me
NB is not the verse that you say
Your grounding at me
First look at your self then talk
Your an ugly Punjabi folk
I wrote in English
It is my Passion
At you you didn't even wrote a sentence aren't you
Is it Punjabi or English I dont care
My wording is alot and I'm prepare
I have dare gut's fuck you slut
Im never gonna let you bunk at first

Nou Maan 
AAAAAANNNNNN
Mr Nomi Boy abusing is bad
Is it in your blood or you head
So sad reminds me that
Talking with the bad guy's
That's what you had
Ok let me look at first
I'm the Punjabi guy
Better than your fats
I haven't wrote a sentece
Is that your saying
Listen to my song "Faith"
Are you hearing
Mad boy released a song standing teasing
What taking you so long to make a next single
You record at your home
Tell me why your fearing
Tell me if you need cooperation
I will give you all the lyrics I wrote with no satisffication

Nomi Boy 
Listen Nou Maan
I don't need you cooperation
The lyrics you wrote you lost in the operation
Haha
Its me and myself in this rap
I'm letting you go with this crap
Do not depend on your fans
They're fake they will not let you make
Your name in this world it twirls
Let it off from the word
Verses I wrote for the people to impress
But I haven't got a chance to be on press
Its stressing me out from the rest
The fans I love they're doing there best
This is not an explanation
Its a tip for you
Nou Maan get rid of these verses diverses you
So to the point let me do it by mine
And do it as your
