One day when I was ridin' on the train, I seen these two kids talkin'
About the Nubian reign had fallen
I didn't say nothin' 'cause these kids caught my goat
Even wore my coat like a murder that they wrote
So this kid with mouth swagger now blazed the cloak and dagger
So I gotta show Dukes the macho lot that I am
I can rock a jam, make the world drop ham
Oh, yes! I'm the bad man, and bad men wear black
And if it comes to droppin' bombs, yo, I'm with that
Though I can freak, fly, flow, fuck up a faggot
Don't understand their ways, and I ain't down with gays
You wanna grab the style that was made from my mom and my dad?
When I was young, I used to run with a notepad
Then time flew, and somehow I knew that I was bad to the bone
Black prodigy since the age of twenty
I could write a rhyme, rip it up and write a next one
Right on the spot, sign my name with a dot
Diamond D threw me some smooth shit, Bronx crowd roar
Stick up your wack jam, everybody hit the floor!
Okay, it's you, Slim, the hard rock of the pack
Don't wanna kneel to the brothers, you must be holdin'
Bust some shit in his chest, now his whole body's swollen
Why did I have to do it? He asked for it!
His man saw it, so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, that's how it's supposed to be
Check it out now
I ain't goin' out, man, that short shit is dead
Have you heard what I said? If not, ask the dread
He got a cannon that's bad!
Similar to the one that I got from my own dad

Your punk ass will be grass quick fast like my name was Flash
When a nigga try and rob me for my cash
You thought you had a sweet vic', nice pick
But you didn't anticipate that I might be sick
Now, who's the trick? 'Cause I'm not a ho (No, no no no!)
I always do the fuckin' if I have to do the buckin'
I leave my Nike's stuck in your rectum
'Til you learn Brand Nubian, yo, you gotta respect 'em
Dissect 'em? Yo, our word is bond regardless
To whom or what, now do the Puma strut
And step the fuck off, before I punch you in your face
With the motherfuckin' bass!
Then you're gonna taste blood in your mouth
It's gonna flood south to the ground
And you're gonna know I don't fuck around
So if you think you had two soft new jacks
We're gonna have to off you with a few cracks
To the jaw, and you won't pop that shit no more
Explainin' to your friends why you're layin' on the floor
Did you want some more? I didn't think so
Just got whipped like a faggot in the clink, so
I suggest you take your bloody mess and find a piece of wire
Fix your broken jaw, then it's time to retire
Lord Jamar will live long
'Cause I give strong blows to the heads of my foes!
Dread flows, gives me power as it grows
Watch how rass-cladda you catch the speed knot
Heed not, and Hell will be your home
Lord Jamar, Sadat, as we swell your dome
