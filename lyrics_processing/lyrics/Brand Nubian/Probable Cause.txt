Now who's this nigga in the 4.6?
About twenty to five, got a truck full of chicks
Just leavin the disco, me and my man from the Knicks
Oak Dog, later on because they live in the Bricks
Jumped on the George Washington and Now Jeru' turnpike
Head feelin right from a long-ass night
Whoa, I see Jake, so I let off the gas
So I was doin fifty-five when I passed his ass
I looked over, caught the shine from the rim of the Rover
You know his next move (*police siren*) pull it over
I pulls over to the right-hand shoulder
Look through the rearview he got his hand on his holster
He had this look, "How this black nigga get this car?"
You know these cracker state troopers don't know rap stars
He asked me for license and my registration
Seen my New York tags and he asked me my destination
I said, "Vacation," handed him my registration
Papers were straight so I didn't wet the situation
Got my shit back, and that was that, but that wasn't that
Cause in fact, I got stopped two more times black

It feel like my hands, stay tied
Cause New York state, and they child care rate
Miss Judge Lady in a courtroom can dictate
A fee for me, to pay monthly
Even suggested, that I be arrested, they don't count
The time invested or the bond beyond the money
They'll hit you with arrears, bad enough to bring tears
They been on my back for years, fuckin with my license
And everytime I'm stopped by Dick I see the Booking
That making me violent in this wilderness land
Now can we talk for a minute?  Cause we both made this child
Can we leave support alone, please take me offa that file
Cause everytime I see the court my blood pressure rise
And the heart attack is a killer of black guys, I stay civilized
Maintain, sometime restrain myself
A court officer is near me, but I think he fear me, cause it's

Yo, on October 22nd we wore black
For all my niggas Po-Po shot in the back
Robocops with the crack, they'll never get props
From the black folks, lock us up while they crack jokes
And stack notes, when we payin the bail
Knowin damn well a nigga's gonna stay in the jail
It's all made for us to fail, the dog is smarter
Than the tail, but if the tail was smarter it would Wag the Dog
I can't wait til we bag the hogg
New York State of Mind doesn't mind, murderin my kind
We even got our own converting across the line
He turned swine, guess his ass'll learn when he burn
They say "Protect and to Serve" and never give the people
The respect they deserve, as if they wasn't equal
These is man-made laws, selectively applied
All they need is probable cause for me to fry
Probable cause (uh-huh) probable cause

I ain't do shit!  Jakes lock a nigga with a weed clip
Couldn't believe it when he took me in
Threw me and my man up in the van, a seven hour stand
Ridin around watchin them arouse the black man
I had the afghan I just copped from the record shop
Took it up the block my usual spot, when I
Rolled the L, I never expected to go to jail
I wish they'd all go to hell
Now Guiliani wanna talk about the "Quality of Life"
Think he got the right to follow me at night
With no probable cause, other than my skin is black like yours
Now they got me in the beast, sittin right in his jaws
Up in Central Booking, yo people looking knowing that
I'm in the rap game, and I got trapped the same way they did
You know these motherfuckers don't play kid
A little smoke caught me for a three day bid, cause it's
