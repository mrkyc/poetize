Make it all the mindless as the face of fear
I never even cared about what I could be
Declared by the war on authority
I doubt you need, 'cause I'm a bad seed
Running on adrenaline and living on greed
I'm tired of being, I'm sick of my scene
Looking for the end or playing so I can finally come clean
'Cause I remember one time
Something to live for, now so long ago
Faces always are changing
Lies in disguise for the things we know
One time something to live for
Somehow I've lost my way
Those times I've pissed away now
There go away my darkest days
Walking every day, thinking that I know best
Wearing my contempt like a bullet-proof vest
On my way, gonna make it all mine
Roll it in the gutter just to kill some time
But I was dead wrong, and now it's all gone
I won't become the fool that I've abused for so long
The line's played out, I've gotta get back
Chase away the negative and throw away the useless track

Something to live for, now so long ago
Faces always are changing
Lies in disguise for the things we know
One time something to live for
Somehow I've lost my way
Those times I've pissed away now
There go away my darkest days
I've seen things I hope I never see again
I don't want to have to variate in more than friends
Living on the edge at the start of good times
Dying as the record seems too late to go and climbs
One time something to live for, now so long ago
Faces always are changing
Lies in disguise for the things we know
One time something to live for
Somehow I've lost my way
Those times I've pissed away now
