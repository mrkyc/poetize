Oh you hoe, you hoe (hoe)
You keep on stalking me, stalking me
(stalking me stalking me)
Oh you hoe, you hoe
(You ain't never coming back no more, more ...)

This bitch she just want me to talk
Mad 'cause I didn't fall off
I guess it's the fact that she couldn't see blood
Somehow she lost
All of my niggas said "BB"
You trippin
'Till they seen that bunny just wanting my money
They prolly can get it
She being vindictive
But I just don't give shit
Would have been a better reason to get rid of it
You wanna be famous
You better come up with another lick
'Cause the shit that you was spitting is irrelevant
And while we fucking up these little niggas let me handle this
You had minute of fame
It's time I'm deading it
In front of my brother and I'm a better man
The rhetoric
It's been 5 years
Quit stalking me
Quit trying to talk to me
Please realize that you lost me
I tried to let you down softly (softly)
You might also like x4
Oh you hoe, you hoe (hoe)
You keep on stalking me, stalking me
(You ain't never coming back no more, more ...)

She got in my journal and lost
Thought she was all in my head
Gave her the code to the gram
Had everybody like dam!
Look at how happy I am (Look how happy he is)
My baby momma looking fat as she can
Embarrassing but I was into that then
Finessing the fans
She borrowing time
It's all in my mind
It's close to the end
So now we just playing this chess
Both of us different intentions and then
I sacrificed a queen and took it upon myself to win
She met the fam
Went across the board
Hit her with JAM
Stretch the floor
Aw shit, I'm bout to get married now
She ain't ever coming back no more (more, more ...)
 x4
Oh you hoe, you hoe (hoe)
You keep on stalking me, stalking me
(You ain't never coming back no more, more ...)
