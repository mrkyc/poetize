Been holdin' on these years
It's bittersweet, these tears
Sayin' to know what love is
You wanna move so fast
But I know we won't last
Gotta let go of all the memories
You may be hurtin' now
But once you understand why we can't hold it out
I'm gon' shed a new skin, babe
You say, "Just hang around
Just give me some time
Oh, give me some time to find my way"
But, baby, I know...

Our love is broken
My heart has frozen
You're not the love of my life
I love my moments
Let me compose it (Yeah)
You're not the love of my life

I no longer feel it linger in my soul
Nothing here feels right with you no more
No more, ayy
I no longer feel it linger in my soul
Nothing here feels right with you no more
No more

Don't wanna reminisce the past (Hey)
'Cause I don't wanna look back
Let bygones be bygones, baby
You said, "Let's work it out"
But I can't seem to get rid of all the doubt
You reap what you sow, babe
Because you messed around
I gave you my trust, but you weren't honest
And now you wish (Now you wish)
That things were the same

Our love is broken
My heart has frozen
You're not the love of my life
I love my moments
Let me compose it (Yeah)
You're not the love of my life

I no longer feel it linger in my soul (In my soul)
Nothing here feels right with you no more
No more, ayy
I no longer feel it linger in my soul (In my soul)
Nothing here feels right with you no more
No more, yeah
Our love is broken (Our love is)
My heart has frozen (Yeah)
You're not the love of my life (You're not)
I love my moments (You're not)
Let me compose it
You're not the love of my life

You ain't the love of my life
You ain't the love of my life
You ain't the love of my life
You wanna... (Love me)
You wanna... (Love me)
You wanna... (Love me)
You wanna... (Love me)
(You wanna love me)
