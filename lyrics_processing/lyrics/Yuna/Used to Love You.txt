I wonder if you think about me
Now that you're out there on your own
You made it seem so easy
I wanna be just like you
I wonder if your heart is healing
You're going out so often now
I see the boys are helping you out
Are they just like you?

No regrets, no looking back now
Never left, you let me back down, no, no, no

Used to love you, used to care but no more
I used to love you, used to care but no more
I used to love you, used to care but no more
I'm better than before

I can never understand why
I'm depending on a guy
To make me feel like I was special
I am special when I'm mine
Keep running on in circles
I was such a slave for love
Now that I know better
I know better of my worth
I was young and I was foolish
Giving up my heart so easy
To someone who didn't love me like I do
I was young and I was foolish
All I needed was my spirit
And someone will come and love me like I do
You might also like
No regrets, no looking back now
Never left, you let me back down, no, no, no

Used to love you, used to care but no more
I used to love you, used to care but no more
I used to love you, used to care but no more
I'm better than before

Used to love you
I used to love you
Used to love you
Used to love you
Used to love you

Used to love you, used to care but no more
I used to love you, used to care but no more
I used to love you, used to care but no more
