I've yet to discover the sound that heart makes when it breaks
Does it yell out loud when it's angry?
Does it weep when it's sad?
And when it's lost, does it call for help?
Would anybody be able to hear it?
How do you find a forgotten heart?
Tucked away in some abandoned place
And giving it another chance of feeling again
Sometimes an old heart just needs a new body
And a lifeless body just needs a new heart
Sometimes you just need a little bit of help from someone
For a heart to do what it is meant to do again

My poor, poor heart
I know you're tired of this all
I know I
I make the same mistakes a lot

I know you never make a sound
When you crash onto the ground
When I fall
For someone
I know I always let you down
You might also like
But I will never give up you
Never giving up
Giving you up for love
For love
I will never give up you
Never giving up
Giving you up for love
For love

Poor, poor heart
I remember when you're red
Now you're tough
Slowly turning into black

I know you never make a sound
You're quiet in my hollow chest
When I yell at someone
You're louder than a breaking glass

But I will never give up you
Never giving up
Giving you up for love
For love
I will never give up you
Never giving up
Giving you up for love
For love

Giving you up for love
You up for love

Are you thinking what I'm thinking
I think it's time for you to start beating again
For love
Are you feeling what Im feeling
Should we go again
Go and give it another chance
For love, yeah, for love

But I'll never give up on you
Never giving up
Giving you up for love
For love

I will never give up you
Never giving up
Giving you up for love
