Where do I begin?
It was 1993 when I was maybe six or seven
And my mom and me was driving
Listening to music I've been singing all the time
Just to see my momma smile, my momma smile

She said I got talent
And she took me to auditions
But nobody paid attention
I was too young for rejection
Never too young for a passion
Cause music kept me going
And I knew one day I would make it
And my momma said

"It takes time
It takes a little time, baby
It will be fine, yeah
It takes time, baby"

Remembering '02
Boy, I really hated school
I wasn't the same as you
I just wanted to be cool
I remember when my only friend left me for a cooler gang
I finally got a taste of what it feels like being betrayed

I was fifteen when I lost my sister
She was battling cancer
Damn I really miss her
We moved up north to start over
A little town and I was a big girl
And I got myself into trouble
I was angry with the world
My momma said

"It takes time
It takes a little time, baby
It will be fine, yeah
It takes time, baby"

I've learnt and lost along the way
Yeah, I made mistakes
Yeah I felt all kinds of pain
And the reason why I'm here to stay
Is because my momma said
For things to be alright

"It takes time
It takes a little time, baby
It will be fine, yeah
It takes time, baby
It takes time
It takes a little time, baby
It will be fine, yeah
It takes time, baby"
Takes a little time, baby
Takes a little time, baby
Takes a little time
Takes a little time
