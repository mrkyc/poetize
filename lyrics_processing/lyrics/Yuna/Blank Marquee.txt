Uh-huh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah
Hmm

I thought we were friends
But now I see the end
You got caught just trying
To be someone you're not
Pretending that you care
But you care for my connections
Making new acquaintances
Friends in higher places
But you should ask yourself, yeah

Who are you without me?
You're just a blank marquee
Trying to cop my steez
Get your own POV

Your toxicity (Your toxicity)
Won't get the best of me
Look into the mirror
Try and see it clearer
You should be reflecting on all of your decisions
You're the type of person to use up my affection, yeah
You should ask yourself

Hold on, hold on
Lemme tell my side
Who am I without you?
I said I'm the same-ass dude (I'm the same guy)
You wanna call me brand new
Like it's all my fault, but that's what you won't do (That's what you won't do)
Nah, now don't try start me
Think I'm your John to your Paul McCartney (Yeah)
Call me a wall, nothing on the marquee
But we both co-headline the party
Yeah, you were right beside me
Next day try to criticize me (Come on)
Used to love me now you despise me
But at this point nothing could surprise me, I know
Who are you without me? (Yeah)
