I can see that lately you've been struggling
I know that you've been demotivated
Saying, "Sometimes things, they just don't go your way
And people gonna say some things about you."

When you give everything
You give everything up for nothing
You'll find when you give everything
You give everything up for nothing
Just tell yourself that

Yeah, I'm not gonna let you get the best of me today
All these people tryna bring out the worst in me
Come look at what you've created
I'm better than what you've been saying

Cause once I was like you
The struggles that I've been through
Cause once I was like you, yeah oh oh

I can see it now the world is changing people
Hiding faces behind screens
Throwing criticisms, you don't need all that
Just keep your head up high, keep walking
You might also like
When you give everything
People hate to see that you're growing, you're growing
When you know everything
Everything you've gone through is worth it
And you tell yourself that

Yeah, I'm not gonna let you get the best of me today
All these people tryna bring out the worst in me
Come look at what you've created
I'm better than what you've been saying

Cause once I was like you
The struggles that I went through
Cause once I was like you
Do it all just like you

Come and see what you've created
Come and see if you like it
Challenge me and I might take it
Take it, take it!

Yeah, I'm not gonna let you get the best of me today
All these people tryna bring out the worst in me
Come look at what you've created
I'm better than what you've been saying
Cause once I was like you
The struggles that I went through
