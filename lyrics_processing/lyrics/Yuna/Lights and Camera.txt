Who? 

Lights
Camera
Strike a pose
And have someone help you put lipstick on
Yeah, high heels now you're six feet tall
And everybody knows who you are

And nobody cares if your heart is aching
Nobody cares if you want no more
Nobody wants to know you cried the night before

Invest in your dreams and your hopes, into it
Everything you used to know is gone
And you're slipping into, in your role
Trying not to lose yourself

Cause these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now
Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself
I will be myself
You might also like
Friendly people all around
And time to put your best face on, yeah
Smiling like there's nothing wrong
Though deep down you feel so alone

And nobody sees who you are inside
Nobody knows that you are so much more
Nobody needs to know
You're tired of putting a show

Invest in your dreams and your hopes, into it
Everything you used to know
Is gone
And you're slipping into, in your role
Trying not to lose yourself

Saying these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now
Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself
Cause these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now
Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself
I will be myself
Nobody cares if your heart is aching
Nobody cares if you want no more
Nobody wants to know
Nobody cares at all

Saying these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now
Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself

I want to be myself
(Who?)
I want to be myself
(Who?)
I want to be myself
