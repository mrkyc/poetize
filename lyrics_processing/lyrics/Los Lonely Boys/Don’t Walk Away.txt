Baby what did I do? (what I do to you)
I see you goin' through my pockets
And you say you smell perfume... (Baby that ain't cool)
I love you every way
I try to show you everyday
Baby where's this comin' from?
I can't tell you what to do
I got nothing left to prove
You never seem to believe a word I say
I'm not gonna tell you lies
Can't you see it in my eyes
Don't want you to turn and walk away (don't walk away)
Now you' re calling all my friends
Trying to find out where I've been (when' it gonna end)
I stood on both sides of a lie
I'm telling you I'm not a guy (baby I ain't lying)
I love you every way
I try to show you everyday
Baby where's this comin' from?
I can't tell you what to do
I got nothing left to prove
You never seem to believe a word I say
I'm not gonna tell you lies
Can't you see it in my eyes
Don't want you to turn and walk away (don't walk away)
Should I away give up on us baby?
I know love don't work this way
I thought we could make it better
Now it's up to you, it's up to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah!!!
I can't tell you what to do
I got nothing left to prove
You never seem to believe a word I say (believe a word say)
I'm not gonna tell you lies
Can't you see it in my eyes
Don't want you to turn and walk away (don't walk away)
I can't tell you what to do
I got nothing left to prove (left to prove)
You never seem to believe a word I say (word I say)
I'm not gonna tell you lies
Can't you see it in my eyes
