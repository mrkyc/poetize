Take a look at yourself
Don't believe everything you see
(Don't believe everything you see)
Don't worry about what you don't have
Is not the clothes that makes a man
Is all about what's inside (what's inside)
You've got the will to survive
Give a little more
Take a little less
The truth's gonna find you if you don't confess
Fight a little harder
Dig a little deeper
Can anybody hear what I'm saying
Give a little
Gotta give a little more now
Give a little
Gotta show me that you know how
Give a little
Gotta give a little more now
That's what we need to do
If your brother falls down
You've got to lend a helping hand
(lend a helping hand)
What goes around comes around
Life isn't always what you planned
Some people don't have the strength inside
We all have the right to be alive

That's what we need to do
We should feel ashamed
Always trying to pass the blame for the things we've done
People always say
Color is just a name
We've got to live as one
It's all about what's inside
You've got the will to survive
Give a little more
Take a little less
The truth's it's gonna find you if you don't confess
