Would you walk away?
I'm not trying to fool you
There's no playing games
You're tired of being alone
And Oh, I feel the same
Oh,oh,oh
Maybe falling in love
Will take away your pain
So I have to say (I have to say)
That I really love you (I really love you)
Don't be afraid (Don't be afraid)
I just wanna know (Just wanna know)
If you're staying with me
Oh I can take you away
To places out of this world
All I need is the time of day
To make your dreams for real
Take a chance on love
I'm gonna do the same
Oh,oh,oh
With two hearts of a kind
We're gonna have it made
