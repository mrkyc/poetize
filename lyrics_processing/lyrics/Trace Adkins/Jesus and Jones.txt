I'm the last one standing
Every Saturday night
All the rights feel wrong
Wrongs feel right
But every Sunday morning
I see the light again
When I'm up on the wagon
I'm a hell of a saint
I'll be damned if there ain't
Another town to paint
Just down the road, man
It's a game that I can't win

I need to find a little middle ground
Between let her rip and settlin' down
Well I go from dry to drown
Lost to found, stone cold sober
To just plain stoned
Try to live like my heroes did
Is the hardest kind of living there is
Been a tug of war since I was a kid
Between Jesus and Jones

I wish I could find a gear between
White lightning and John 3:16
But girl I can't promise
Anything right now
All I can say is I wanna change
And I keep the faith
That you'll take the reins
And hold on tight
And calm this crazy down

I need to find a little middle ground
Between let her rip and settlin' down
Well I go from dry to drown
Lost to found, stone cold sober
To just plain stoned
Try to live like my heroes did
Is the hardest kind of living there is
Been a tug of war since I was a kid
Between Jesus and Jones
I need to find a little middle ground
Between let her rip and settlin' down
Well I go from dry to drown
Lost to found, stone cold sober
To just plain stoned
Try to live like my heroes did
Is the hardest kind of living there is
Been a tug of war since I was a kid
Between Jesus and Jones
Only Heaven knows where I fit in
Between Jesus and Jones, yeah
