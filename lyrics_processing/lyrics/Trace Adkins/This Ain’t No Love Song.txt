Well my heart didn't skip a beat
When I saw you standing there
Looking like some kind of angel
Like you were walking on air
And the Earth didn't move
When you first said my name, I didn't feel a thing
No, not me, my heart didn't skip a beat

This ain't no love song
I just felt like getting my guitar on
And singing a tune, singing about you, yeah
Feeling good and tapping my shoes
And all this stuff I'm making up
Well, you probably won't be hearing it on the radio
But then you never know
So baby if you want, you can sing along, but this ain't no love song

I couldn't sleep last night
But you weren't on my mind
And I went for a drive last night
But if you saw me driving by
Well, I must have took a wrong turn
I must have been thinking something else
Had a melody in my head
Yeah, maybe that's why I couldn't sleep last night

Yeah half this stuff I'm making up
Well, you probably won't be hearing it on the radio

So baby if you want, you can sing along, but this ain't no love song
