Every now and then you got to take it on the chin
Got to turn the other cheek
But then there's times your old stubborn pride
Don't back down so easily
And you got no choice but to let your voice
Be heard and hold your ground
And that's the point that he'll get the point
And he'll probably back down
But if he bows up and steps across that line
You got to whoop a man's ass sometimes

Man, I'll be the first one here to call you crazy
If you let me catch you cussing at a kid or roughing up a lady
And God forbid that anybody mess with mine
You got to whoop a man's ass sometimes

Yeah, I let it slide when the liquored up guy
Asked me, "Boy, what you looking at?"
And I kept my cool when the reckless fool
Put a dent in my Cadillac
And I don't care if my long hair
Draws stares the way it does
Long as you ain't throwing sticks and stones
You'd probably be alright 'cause
I'll take the high road if I can out of a bind
But you gotta whoop a man's ass sometimes

Man, I'll be the first one here to call you crazy

Hmm, that's right
