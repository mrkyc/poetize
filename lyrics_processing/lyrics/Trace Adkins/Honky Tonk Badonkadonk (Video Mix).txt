Turn it up some
Alright boys, this is her favorite song
You know that right
So, if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Ooh, she put her beer down
Here she comes, here she comes
Left, left, left, right, left
Whoo!
Hustlers shooting eight-ball
Throwing darts at the wall
Feeling damn near 10 ft. tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Old T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out of his chair
Poor old boy, it isn't his fault
It's so hard not to stare

At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keeping perfect rhythm
Make you want to swing along
Got it going on
Like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee
Shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There ought to be a law
Get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how's she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk
(Aww son!)

Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
You ain't got to hate her
For working that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hanging out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave

At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keeping perfect rhythm
Make you want to swing along
Got it going on
Like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee
Shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There ought to be a law
Get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how's she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk

We don't care about the drinking
Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shaking
When she gets the urge to dance
Driving everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch
At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keeping perfect rhythm
Make you want to swing along
Got it going on
Like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee
Shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There ought to be a law
Get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how's she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk

That honky tonk badonkadonk
Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk

(That's it, right there boys, that's why we do what we do
It isn't for the money, it isn't for the glory, it isn't for the free whiskey
