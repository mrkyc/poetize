Turn it up some
Alright, boys
This is her favorite song, you know that, right?
So if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Oh, she put her beer down
Here she comes, here she comes
Left, left, left, right, left
Woo

Hustlers shootin' eight ball, throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near ten feet tall, here she comes, Lord, help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair
Poor ol' boy, it ain't his fault, it's so hard not to stare

At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And ooh-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk

Aw, son

Now, honey, you can't blame her for what her mama gave her
It ain't right to hate her for workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two, but we're hangin' out 'til three
We hate to see her go, but love to watch her leave

With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And ooh-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
With that honky tonk badonkadonk

Oh, that's what I'm talkin' about right there, honey

We don't care about the drinkin', barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start to shakin' when she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy, you think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look, but you can't touch
That honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And ooh-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk

That honky tonk badonkadonk
Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)
That's it right there, boys
That's why we do what we do
It ain't for the money, it ain't for the glory
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)
It ain't for the free whiskey
It's for the badonkadonk
