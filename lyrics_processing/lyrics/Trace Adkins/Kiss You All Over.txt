When I get home, babe
Going to light your fire
All day I've been thinking about you
Babe, you're my one desire
Going to wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh, babe I want to taste your lips
I want to be your fantasy, yeah
I don't what I'd do without you, babe
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover
No, you're everything to me
And every time I'm with you, baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're laying in my arms
And you do the things you do
You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
I love you, need you, oh babe

I want to kiss you all over
And over again
I want to kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
