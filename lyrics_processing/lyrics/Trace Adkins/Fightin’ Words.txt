Alright

Everyone knows I'm the hard working, peace loving type
I walk a thousand miles out of my way
Just to keep from a fight
Poke fun at the way that I talk
Or this hat that I wear
You can say what you want about me
See if I care

But one slip of the tongue about my God or my mama
Or this flag that I wear on my shirt
You'll see a side of me man
That I don't think you want to
Because then there's fighting words

Now don't get me wrong
I've swapped skin now and then in my youth
I was all for an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
Now the older I get
The less I want to stand toe to toe
But before you go running your mouth
I think you ought to know

But one slip of the tongue about my God or my mama
Or this flag that I wear on my shirt
You'll see a side of me man
That I don't think you want to
Because then there's fighting words

Chevrolet or Ford
The south or the north
That ain't going to get me worked up
But I'll draw the line
Every time when it comes to the things that I love

But one slip of the tongue about my God or my mama
Or this flag that I wear on my shirt
You'll see a side of me man
That I don't think you want to
Because then there's fighting words

Excuse me
First amendment?
Son, the first amendment protects you from the government
Not from me
You can say whatever you want to out there
You come within reach of me
I'll exercise my right to give you a good old country ass whooping
Is what I'll do for you
