Mile marker two-oh-three
The gas gauge leanin' on the edge of 'E'
And I'll be danged if the rain ain't pourin' down
Somethin's smokin' underneath the hood
There's a bangin' and a clangin' and it can't be good
And it's another fifty miles to the nearest town

Everything I own's in the back in a Hefty bag
I'm out of cigarettes and I'm down to my last drag

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear-view mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me keep me movin' somehow
Don't let me start wishin' I was with her now
I've made it this far without cryin' a single tear
And I'd sure hate to break down here

A hundred fifty thousand miles ago
Before the bad blood and busted radio
You said I was all you'd ever need
But love is blind and little did I know
That you were just another dead-end road
Paved with pretty lies and broken dreams

Baby, leavin' you was easier than bein' gone
Don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear-view mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me keep me movin' somehow
Don't let me start wishin' I was with her now
I've made it this far without cryin' a single tear
And I'd sure hate to break down here

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear-view mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me keep me movin' somehow
Don't let me start wishin' I was with her now
I've made it this far without cryin' a single tear
And I'd sure hate to break down...
It's too late to turn around
I'd sure hate to break down here
