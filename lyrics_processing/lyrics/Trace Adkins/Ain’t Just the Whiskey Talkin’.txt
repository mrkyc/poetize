You're so cool, so hot
Shaking that thing with everything you got
In your jeans and your boots
Making all the country boys go ooh, ooh, ooh
Full moon, slow dance
Your hands in the back pockets of my pants
Getting drunk on your kiss
Baby, I could spend the rest of my life like this

That ain't just the whiskey talkin'
It's my heart knowing what it's wantin'
All of that stuff brewing up in Kentucky
Don't come close to way that you buzz me
I know 'fore the night is through
I'm gonna want another little shot of you
So, baby catch me, I'm fallin'
And that ain't just the whiskey talkin'

You got my head spinning 'round
Like I threw one too many down
With a fire in me
I can't stop thinking how good it'd be
To get alone somewhere
Underneath the stars and the midnight air
Just the two of us
'Cause your love is really good stuff, and
