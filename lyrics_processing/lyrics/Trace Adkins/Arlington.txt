I never thought that this is where I'd settle down
I thought I'd die an old man back in my hometown
They gave me this plot of land, me and some other men
For a job well done

There's a big white house sits on a hill just up the road
The man inside, he cried the day they brought me home
They folded up a flag and told my mom and dad
We're proud of your son

And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property
I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company
I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done
I can rest in peace, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington

I remember Daddy brought me here when I was eight
We searched all day to find out where my granddad lay
And when we finally found that cross
He said, "Son, this is what it costs to keep us free"

Now here I am a thousand stones away from him
He recognized me on the first day I came in
And it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels
And saluted me

And I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done
I can rest in peace, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington

And every time I hear, twenty-one guns
I know they brought another hero home, to us

We're thankful for those thankful for the things we've done
We can rest in peace, 'cause we are the chosen ones
We made it to Arlington
Yeah, dust to dust, don't cry for us
