Go ahead and chase me sucker, catch me if you can
Hope you like the taste of dirt that ring on my right hand
Before you even get to me, you have to get through my whole band
I'll never be a worthless Lying politician man
You won't catch me in no college class, rather live of off the land
Seen the devil's face we made our peace and now I'm on the loose
I slipped out on your daughter like I slipped out of your noose
I ain't never been afraid of death, been kicked and shot and stabbed
I'm the best you ever seen, I'm the worst you ever had
As far as staying her goes girl, I think I'm gonna pass now
That ain't country, I'll kiss her fucking ass
I'm a low down wound up road bound man
Go ahead and chase me sucker, catch me if you can
Hope you like the taste of dirt that ring on my right hand
Before you even get to me, you have to get through my whole band
I've kicked a few bad habits, and I've seen a few *men* die
All my friends are family, my family is my life
I've worked a few long hours, yeah I've packed my share of steel
As far as selling out goes, I ain't even looking for a deal
But you so you know I'm grateful for everything I done
Everyone I met and every song I sung
I'm a low down wound up road bound man
Go ahead and chase me sucker, catch me if you can
Hope you like the taste of dirt that ring on my right hand
Before you even get to me, you have to get through my whole band
I'm a low down wound up road bound man
Go ahead and chase me sucker, catch me if you can
Hope you like the taste of dirt that ring on my right hand
