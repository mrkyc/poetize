Just about twenty miles pas county line
I don't remember, exactly how we got there
But I ain't ever goin to forget the day that Ghost Town tried
We pulled up to a filling station
Yeah right next door was a hotel and saloon
Let's get crazy! I said to the boys then
We pulled out our guns and started shooting at the moon!
We got lost in North Dakota
You know me; I wouldn't lie
When that Ghost Town tried to kill me
You ain't gonna believe who saved our lives
Hell I don't even believe who saved our lives
I started gambling, and I caught a cheater
I pulled out my gun and shot him right between the eyes
He didn't fall down, hell, he didn't even start bleeding
And that's when I noticed there was something definitely wrong
All the barmaids had turned to demons
And the whislkey in my glass had turned as cold as ice
I started praying, boys they started screaming!
We all got up and started running for our lives...

When that Ghost Town tried to kill me
You ain't gonna believe who saved our lives
Just hold on you're 'bout to find out who saved our lives
Now this next part may seem kinda crazy
But I swear on my pappy's grave that it's the truth
We were surrounded in this little prairy
When the sky turned an awfull wicked blue
There were noises kinda like a train wreck
I couldn't help but think this day would be my last
Then the clouds, they started changing
And out from them came the ghost of Johnny Cash!
We got lost in North Dakota
You know me; I wouldn't lie
When that Ghost Town tried to kill me
The ghost of Johnny Cash saved our lives
