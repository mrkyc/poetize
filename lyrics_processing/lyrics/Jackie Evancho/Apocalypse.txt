Fixing, to find you
In this treacherous terrain
There's landslides, landmines
It's a jungle that we made
You're not the king of it no more
And I'm not the girl that you would die for
None of us is better than the other
None of us is better than the other
It draws blood, the sweet sting
But it's the poison that we know
I thank God, you found me
And God knows how I let you go
Are we a kingdom where you save me
Is it a shadow I'm chasing
I know I'll never see you in another
You know you'll never see me in another

To lose you
Really lose you
I'm gonna have to lose myself
I'm gonna have to lose myself
No matter how long it'll hurt like this
When I go into the apocalypse
I'm gonna go crazy
Crazy
To lose you
You might also like
Day flies and night falls
I break out my artillery
I suit up for night crawls
I go out disguised as mean
No matter how much I have wanted
I can't go home cause it's haunted
I don't know if my heart can still afford this
Sleeping in a bed that was our fortress

To lose you
Really lose you
I'm gonna have to lose myself
I'm gonna have to lose myself
No matter how long it'll hurt like this
When I go into the apocalypse
I'm gonna go crazy
Crazy
To lose you

Used to love listening to sad songs
Strikes my fingers all along
The silver linings
Now I don't listen to sad songs
Cause my old world is blowing up behind me
It's all for good
A better world will find me
To lose you
Really lose you
I'm gonna have to lose myself
I'm gonna have to lose myself
No matter how long it'll hurt like this
When I go into the apocalypse
I'm gonna go crazy
Crazy
To lose you

No matter how long it'll hurt like this
When I go into the apocalypse
I'm gonna go crazy
Crazy
