Yesterday I gave your side of the bed away
Now I can barely be inside this room
And what if I just had to hear your voice today?
What if I don't know what else to do?

I woke up from dreaming you were calling me
Now I can barely stand to check my phone
Sometimes I wish he wasn't so good to me
Sometimes I wish my cover would be blown

And I miss you and it won't stop
And I miss you and you don't know it
Never thought that I would feel this way
What if's nothing's worth the price I pay?
And I want you and it won't give
And I want you and you don't know it
No, I don't know how to feel this way
What if nothing's worth the price I pay?

I can't even drive by that old restaurant
(I can't even listen to our song)
How do you get over what's not done
(No, it's not over yet)
I can't even remember what we fought about
And now I wish that we fought hard enough
You might also like
And I miss you and it won't stop
And I miss you and you don't know it
Never thought that I would feel this way
What if's nothing's worth the price I pay?
And I want you and it won't give
And I want you and you don't know it
No, I don't know how to feel this way
What if nothing's worth the price I pay?

It got so cold inside
I don't know where to go
I wanna tell you why but I don't
If I did, would it change your mind?
I miss you and it won't stop
And I miss you and I miss you and I miss you
And you don't know it

And I miss you and it won't stop
And I miss you and you don't know it
Never thought that I would feel this way
What if's nothing's worth the price I pay?
And I want you and it won't give
And I want you and you don't know it
No, I don't know how to feel this way
