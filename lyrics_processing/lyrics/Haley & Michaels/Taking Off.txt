Our song said it just keeps getting better
Said all that you couldn't say
Well I guess you never meant it anyway
You said there'd never be a last time
Our song said it feels like the first time everytime
Well baby I go back to that night
When you looked in my eyes
You sing, "I don't know how you do, what you're doing here"
You sing, "Baby I'm amazed"
In my ear
Now everytime
It comes on
It's just another
Just another love song
Baby I'm amazed
It all fell through
You sing, "Baby I'm amazed, amazed by you"
Now everytime
It comes on
It's just another
Just another love song
Never thought I'd hear
It without singing
Never thought it'd lose all it's meaning
I thought I'd have you by my side
Like the song said
For the rest of my life
You sing, "I don't know how you do, what you're doing here"
You sing
"Baby I'm amazed"
In my ear
Now everytime
It comes on
It's just another
Just another love song
Baby I'm amazed
It all fell through
You sing, "Baby I'm amazed, amazed by you"
Now everytime
It comes on
It's just another
Just another love song
And everytime
That it comes on
Do you turn it off
Or do you sing along?
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
Just another love song
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Just another love song
Baby I'm amazed
It all fell through
You sing, "Baby I'm amazed, amazed by you"
Now everytime
It comes on
It's just another
Just another love song
Baby I'm amazed
'Cause everytime
It comes on
It's just another
