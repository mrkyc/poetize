Me Too is a movement about healing
It's about joy
It's about love

Do have a voice but the child inside is too afraid to speak?
Ever think you're strong till someone told you you weak?
Guard your secrets and all the pain you've been through
Me too
Me too

Ever wish that you could redo something that you did?
Regain the innocence you lost when you were a kid?
Shut the TV off cause you can't watch the evening news?
Me too
Me too

When the world keeps breaking your heart
And we're a million miles apart
Just dancing in the dark
Not just looking for a spark
Together all alone cause you're out there on your own
Baby, it ain't only you
Me too
Tarana: We have to use the power of our collective voices...
Me too
Tarana: to make a difference

Have thought that now's the time for texting?
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
Be there for me-- too

When the world keeps breaking your heart
And we're a million miles apart
Just dances in the dark
Not just looking for a spark
Together all alone
Baby, it ain't only you
Me too

To all of the survivors out there struggling
Feeling isolated or unheard
Looking for a way forward
Trying to find hope
Please know that
You are not alone

Michaels: When the world keeps breaking your heart
Haley: We're a million miles apart
Both: Just dances in the dark
Not just looking for a spark
Together all alone
Cause you're just out there all alone
Baby, it ain't only you
Tarana: Cultivating joy creates a pathway to healing
Me too
Tarana: Our wounds are were the light enters
Me too
Me too
