I like your banjo in there

Girl, you drank all my beer
And the whiskey is all gone
I am sitting here
Ready to get it on
You got me thinking you would not
You got me thinking you might
And it is 3 o'clock in the morning
And I cannot beat around the bush all night

We have already kissed
(We have already kissed)
We have already danced
(We have already danced)
You are wondering if
You ought to put on your shoes
Or pull down your pants
(Come on, pull down your pants)
What would it hurt?
Pull off that shirt
Babe, we have already come this far
Get out of your clothes
Or get out of my car
You might also like
Whichever you choose
I am ready to go
I could take you to the house, baby
Or I can drive it on home
We can do it right here
Or do it somewhere else
But make up your mind
Do something quick
Or I am going to do it myself

We have already kissed
(We have already kissed)
We have already danced
(We have already danced)
You are wondering if
You ought to put on your shoes
Or pull down your pants
(Come on, pull down your pants)
What would it hurt?
Pull off that shirt
Babe, we have already come this far
Get out of your clothes
Or get out of my car
We are going to drive around a little while then
Let us do it over here in the middle, babe

We have already kissed
(We have already kissed)
We have already danced
(We have already danced)
You are wondering if
You ought to put on your shoes
Or pull down your pants
(Come on, pull down your pants)
What would it hurt?
Pull off that shirt
Babe, we have already come this far
Get out of your clothes
Or get out of my car

I got out of my clothes
She got out of my car
What is up, babe?
Bye, bye, boredom
