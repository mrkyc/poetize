I never ask you where you're goin'
I've never asked you where you've been
I've never called and checked your story
You stayed out with all your friends
I've never tried to catch you lyin'
I didn't want to know the truth
I'd rather go on lovin' blind, girl
Than go on lovin' without you

I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I'm not sayin' that you, could ever be true
I just don't want to know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now
What I didn't know then

I've always said what I don't know
Couldn't hurt as bad as leavin' you
Turns out I knew what I was thinkin'
It ain't an easy thing to do
Well, I guess I should be goin'
I sure found out too much to stay
Please don't say you're sorry
I might wait another day
You might also like
I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I'm not sayin' that you, could ever be true
I just don't want to know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now
What I didn't know then

You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now
What I didn't know then

Yeah, I wish somehow I didn't know now
