Don't my baby look good in them blue jeans?
Tight on the top with a belly button ring
A little tattoo somewhere in between
She only shows to me

Hey we're going out dancin', she's ready tonight
So damn good-lookin' boys, it ain't even right
And when bartender says for the lady
What's it going to be?
I tell him, man

She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose, and
She can't stand the thought of sippin' champagne

No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila, she needs
Somethin' with a little more edge and a little more pain

She's my little whiskey Girl
She's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough
You might also like
Baby got a '69 mustang, four on the floor
And you oughta hear the pipes ring
I jump behind the wheel and it's-a-way we go

Hey, I drive too fast, but she don't care
Blue bandana tied all up in her hair
Just sittin' there, singin' every song on the radio

She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose, and
She can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne

No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila, she needs
Somethin' with a little more edge, and a little more pain

She's my little whiskey Girl
She's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough
2:51 - 3:10

No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila, she needs
Somethin' with a little more edge, and a little more pain

She's my little whiskey Girl
Oh, she's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough

Yeah, I like 'em rough
