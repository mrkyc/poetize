Sorry you missed me I'll get back to you as soon as I can, thank you and God bless

Got the news on Friday mornin'
But a tear I couldn't find
You showed me how I am supposed to live
And now you showed me how to die
I was lost 'til Sunday morning
I woke up to face my fear
While writing you this good-bye song I found a tear

I'm gonna miss that smile
I'm gonna miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in Heaven
'Cause that's right where you wanna be
I'm not cryin' 'cause I feel so sorry for ya
I'm cryin' for me

I got up and dialed your number
And your voice came on the line
With that old familiar message
I've heard a thousand times
It just said, "Sorry that I missed you
Leave a message and God bless"
I know that you think I'm crazy
But I had to hear your voice I guess
You might also like
I'm gonna miss that smile
I'm gonna miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in Heaven
'Cause that's right where you wanna be
I'm not cryin' 'cause I feel so sorry for ya
I'm cryin' for me

Oh
So play your upside down, left handed
Backwards bass guitar
I'll see you on the other side, superstar

I'm gonna miss that smile
I'm gonna miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in Heaven
'Cause that's right where you wanna be
I'm not cryin' 'cause I feel so sorry for ya
I'm cryin' for me
I'm still cryin'
I'm cryin' for me
Oh
