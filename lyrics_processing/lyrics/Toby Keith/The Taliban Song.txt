"I'm just a middle-aged, middle-eastern camel herding man
I got a little, 2 bedroom cave here in North Afghanistan
Things used to be real nice and they got out of hand when they moved in
They call themselves the Taliban
(o yeah the Taliban) (Taliban baby)
Now I ain't seen my wife's face since they came here
They make her wear a scarf over her head that covers her from ear to ear
She loves the desert and the hot white sand
But man she's just like me, nah she can't stand
The Taliban (o Taliban baby)

You know someday soon we're both going to saddle up and it'll be
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smiling right by my side
We should do just fine out around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to the Taliban
(oh yeah the Taliban) (baby)

I know where you coming from brother!
This is a patriotic love song
So y'all feel free to salute if you want
You got my permission
You might also likeNow they attacked New York City cause they thought they could win
Said they would, stand and fight until the very bloody end
Mr. Bush got on the phone with Iraq and Iran and said "Now, you
Sons-of-bitches you better not be doing any business with the Taliban"
(Taliban baby)
So we prayed to Allah with all of our might
Until those big U.S. jets came flying one night
They dropped little bombs all over their holy land
And man you should have seen them run like rabbits, they ran
(the Taliban)

You know someday soon we're both going to saddle up and it'll be
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smiling right by my side
We should do real fine out around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip a couple fingers to the Taliban
(oh yeah, Taliban)
