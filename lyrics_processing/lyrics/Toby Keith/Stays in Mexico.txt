His name was Steve, her name was Gina
(You've never been here before have you?)
They met at a bar called Cabo Wabo Cantina
He was an insurance salesman from South Dakota
She was a first grade school teacher Phoenix Arizona
(No, my first time here)
They started dancin' and it got real hot
Then it spilled over to the parkin' lot
One more tequila they were fallin' in love
One more is never enough

Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico

He woke up in the morning and he made a little telephone call
To check on his wife and his kids back at home in Sioux Falls
(Hey babe everything okay?)
She hopped right in the shower with a heavy, heavy mind
(What am I doing?)
He knew it was the first time Gina had ever crossed that line

They walked down to the beach and started drinkin' again
Jumped into the ocean for a dirty swim
One more margarita then we're falling in love
One more's never enough

Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Oh, Mexico

Waiting at the bar at the terminal gate
She says "Steve I gotta go, I'm gonna miss my plane"
He said "One more tequila 'fore you climb on up"
She said "One more's never enough"

Don't bite off more than you can chew
There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do
Just remember when you let it all go
What happens down in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
Stays in Mexico
