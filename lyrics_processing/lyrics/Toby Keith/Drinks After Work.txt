Talk on the phone, stare at the screen
Doing' the job, living the dream
Getting paid
Yeah right
Thinking about what I'll say to prove
That we should go out for a laugh or two
Instead of going home tonight

'Been a long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

Happy hour's like a holiday
Hanging with you's like getting away
Let's conversate
For a little while
Well, keep me company, catch me up
It's a whole lot better than being stuck
In a drive-time 9 to 5
I'd rather see you smile
You might also like
A long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?

'Been a long day
And the boss don't get it
Don't you wanna take the edge off
With some 7 and 7?
Just crushing' on a friend
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
Sipping' and tipping' some drinks after work?

A long day, no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun, two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?
Long day
No break
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
Have a little drink after work?
