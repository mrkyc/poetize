I quit school in the 10th grade and I grew out my hair
I got me a job doing lawnmower repair
I met an army recruiter down at the Winn-Dixie
He said "son you've no future, pack up and go with me"

The first place we landed was a base called Ballad
They convoyed our asses to a 10 acre F.O.B
With my boots and my cover and an old M16
Two bottles of water and a cold M.R.E

Oh you'll meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade
It's not a job, it's an adventure, oh yes sir I got that
Ah but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at
You never told me I'd get my ass shot at

The first night in combat we went out on patrol
They ambushed our convey and we chased the asshole
We found them all hiding in low water ditches
And we took aim and killed all them son of a bitches

Oh you'll meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade
It's not a job, it's an adventure, oh yes sir I got that
Ah but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at
You never told me I'd get my ass shot at
You might also like
Walked in on my buddy with a female M.P
The ugliest woman you ever did see
He said "why are you laughing, you got lots of nerve"
Over here in the desert we grade on the curve

Ah you'll meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade
It's not a job, it's an adventure, oh yes sir I got that
Ah but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at
