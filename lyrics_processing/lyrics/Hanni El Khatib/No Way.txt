We built a house
We tore it down
We made some noise
Yeah, we stood our ground
We ran the streets
Every night and day
We share one key
To the very place
Where our grand mama stayed

We see them coming from a mile away
(But they know)
We're going nowhere even if we are chased
(And it's true)
We got no money but we sure got our pride
(And they can't)
Take that away from us 'cause we're still alive

When the fog rolls in
They can't see a thing
We'll be there
When the fights get real
And the lights burn out
We'll be prepared
You might also like
We woke up
Head splitting from the sounds of the change in the streets
But it don't matter 'cause our cousin fixed us something to eat
Yeah, ain't going hungry no more

We see them coming from a mile away
(But they know)
We're going nowhere even if we are chased
(And it's true)
We got no money but we sure got our pride
(And they can't)
Take that away from us 'cause we're still alive
Nah, nah

You ain't the biggest dog, ooo
No, not at all, ooo
You ain't the biggest dog, ooo
No, not at all, ooo

No way, no way
No way, no way
Woo, yeah
We see them coming from a mile away
(But they know)
We're going nowhere even if we are chased
(And it's true)
We got no money but we sure got our pride
(And they can't)
Take that away from us 'cause we're still alive
Nah, nah, one time, one time
We see them coming from a mile away
(But they know)
We're going nowhere even if we are chased
And it's true
We got no money but we sure got our pride
(They can't)
