Baby, you're dead wrong
(Woah)
Darling, you're dead wrong
I know that I am dead on
When I say that you don't know me, you're dead wrong
Come on
Honey don't be afraid of me
Even though it's just the two of us on your street
You know a man like me means you no harm
I've just got something to say
Hopefully something that will brighten up your day
Let me get it out and I'll move on
Even though I look the part
I've still got my heart
You know I'm a person too
Even if you might not think it's true
You're dead wrong
Yeah you're dead wrong
Woah, you're dead wrong
Yeah you're dead wrong
Yeah, I know it might be a scary sight
To run into a bunch of us at night
You might think we're all fucked up high
Surprise, I don't got that rock in my eyes
But I do have a song to sing
A story to tell, a dream of diamond things
But until God truly decides
I guess I'm stuck in hard times
You might also likeI know that time will fade
So long as I stand brave
I ain't asking to be saved
I'm just saying it's a tough life this way
Baby you're dead wrong
Oh, darling your dead wrong
I know that I am dead on
When I say that you don't know me, you're dead wrong
Come on
Baby you're dead wrong
Woah, darling your dead wrong
I know that I am dead on
When I say that you don't know me you're dead wrong
Come on
Yeah you're dead wrong
Cos' when the

Come around
Cos' when the
(cops x7)
Come around
Yeah they'll put me down
(down x7)
Yeah they'll put me down
Come on
They'll put me down
(down x7)
Yeah they'll put me down
