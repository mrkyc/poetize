Welcome to the Church of Suicidal
We'll have a sermon and a wonderful recital
But before we go on there's something I must mention
An important message I must bring to your attention
I was in meditation and prayer last night
I was awakened by a shining bright light
Overhead, a glorious spirit
He gave me a message and you all need to hear it

He said to
Send me your money
That's what he said, he said to
Send me your money

Now if you can only send a dollar or two
There ain't a hell of a lot I can promise to you
But if you want to see heaven's door
Make out a check for five mil dollars or more
You might also like
Send me your money
Do you hear what I said?
Send me your money

Now give me some bass
Ooh yeah that's how we like it
Now give me some silence..
For all you sinners!
Now give me more bass
Yeah that was funky
Now take them on home Brother Clark
Send me your money

Here comes another con hiding behind a collar
His only god is the almighty dollar
He ain't no prophet, he ain't no healer
He's just a two bit goddamn money stealer

(Send me your money) Send it, you got to send it
Send me your money
You hear what I'm saying?
(Send me your money) You gotta send it
Send it, send me your money
Now how much you give is your own choice
But to me it's the difference between a Porsche and a Rolls Royce
I want you to make it hurt when you dig into your pocket
Cause it makes me feel so good to watch my profits rocket

(Send me your money) Now dig in deep, dig real deep into your pocket
I want you to make it hurt
(Send me your money) We'll take cash, we'll take checks
We'll take credit cards, we'll take jewelry
We'll take your momma's dentures if they got gold in them

So whose gonna be the next king of the fakers
Whose gonna take the place of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker?
See my momma, she didn't raise no fool
Cause you can't put a price on a miracle
