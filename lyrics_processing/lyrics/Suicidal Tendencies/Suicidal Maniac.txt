He's back
Maniac!

A birth that came from more than sound
Now rages on from town to town
A giant grows more every day
And now the maniac is here to stay

A feeling you can't kill
It's the power, it's a will
Controls your thoughts but you can't see

Just when you thought it safe he suddenly appears
He feels no pain, he has no mercy or no fears
He gives the message and your mind is filled with blue
And now the maniac lives inside of you

He's back
The suicidal maniac

Each day he grows more and more
He's bigger now than ever before
His thoughts he'll compromise on never
He can't be stopped
He'll live forever
You might also likeBlast away through the mind
A power of another kind
A presence that is growing out of sound

And now it's come, the time the maniac I'll meet
He takes my hand and now I bow down to his feet
His love for me is like a father to a son
And now the maniac and I are one
I bow to his might
Too powerful to fight
It's my destiny
Now the maniac lives inside of me


He's back
The suicidal maniac

An army at his command
A strength that you can't comprehend
A force unknown can now be told
The power of the world he holds
A feeling you can't kill
It's the power, it's the will
Controls your thoughts but you can't see

Just when you thought it safe he suddenly appears
He feels no pain, he has no mercy or no fears
He gives the message and your mind is filled with blue
And now the maniac's a part of you
And the time has come, the maniac you'll meet
He takes your hand and now you bow down to his feet
His love for you is like a father to a son
And now the maniac and you are one

He's back
