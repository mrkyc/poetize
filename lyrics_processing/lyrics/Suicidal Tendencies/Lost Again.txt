Like an animal locked in a cage
Now I look into the barrel of a gauge
BOOM!
Made me into the fool
Experimented on me like an animal
Turned me into a common criminal (criminal)
I lost it, but I gotta get with it
Motherfucker, now you're gonna get it
I ain't one that'll sit and forget it
I got into a war I can never win
Where the nightmare never ever ends
And I don't know what I'm saying
Got into a war with reality
That motherfucker, it was waiting for me
And I lost again!
I lost again!
Took my dreams, ya left them there shattered
Took my hopes, ya dug them and they splattered
Took my mind like it didn't even matter
Entered a world that I didn't belong
Thought I could take it, but I stayed too long
Thought I could handle it
Boy, was I wrong!

Where the nightmare never ever ends
And I'm not into playing
Got into a war with reality
That motherfucker it was waiting for me
And I lost again!
Lost it! Lost again
Lost it! Lost again
Lost it! Lost again
I Lost it!
I went to war with reality
That motherfucker he was waiting for me
I never thought this could happen to me-damn!
Down so low, but I can't get no higher
When I was burning up you put wood in the fire
You ain't nothing but a goddamn liar-liar!
Took all my strength now I tremble and drop
You got to be down to go over the top
Oh, God can't you make this laughter stop?
Died in a war I could never win
Where the nightmare never ever ends
And I lost it again
Got into a war with reality
That motherfucker it was waiting for me
And I lost again!
Liar, killer! Lost again!
I lost it!
Murder, Killer! Hell I lost again!
No! No!
Cleanse me from your evil
You broke your promises!
What did I do to deserve this?
No one to save me from it!
Oh, Lord please have mercy
And now I've come to see it
Something's gone wrong with me
I guess I got lost in reality
What's that gone wrong with me?
I guess I got lost in reality
Hell I lost again!
