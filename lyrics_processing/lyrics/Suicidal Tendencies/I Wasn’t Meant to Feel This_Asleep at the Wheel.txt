Yeah, just a little closer
(What's he doing?)
It was, I know, by the corner, yeah
Sitting in the darkness, yeah
I didn't see it, but I know
It tries to hide sometimes, he he he
But it can't fool me, no
Because I have this thing, it's the way I see
The way I see when my eyes are closed
A kind of perception of misconception
It's really quite a, shall we say a
A really beautiful thing
There's a certain things that I've come to find
In my communications that never existed
Certain understandings that I've come to realize, yeah
But I don't believe it, no
Not for second
It wasn't really truthful in the ways that a-, that a-, that a-, that
They're here right now, yeah
I wasn't meant to feel this
I wasn't meant to feel this
I wasn't meant to feel this way
I wasn't meant to feel this

Confused understanding
With a slip for the hold Ai ai ai ai ai...

You're asleep at the wheel
A magical moment is it
Too much of a good thing?
Recycled in memory, was it
Too much of a good thing?
Why can't you remember? Is it
Too much of a good thing?
Preserved in its danger
You're all asleep at the wheel
Blank stare and a whisper (blank stare and a whisper)
But who are the judges (Who are you judging?)
I thought you'd be different (I thought you'd be different)
You're asleep at the wheel, you're asleep at the wheel
A special assignment, is it
Too much of a good thing?
Unlocked under pressure, was it
Too much of a good thing?
Confined in forgiveness, is it
Too much of a good thing?
A new kind of danger
You're all asleep at the wheel
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Hope in revision (ooh)
Slight miscalculation (aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
It all goes in stages (ooh ah ooh ah)

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
A blank stare and a whisper
I thought you were different
But who are you judging
