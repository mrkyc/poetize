I guess I'll try, I just wanna sleep
Slip away in a trance so deep
Feel my soul floating free, no more pain left in me
And then I sleep until tomorrow, when I wake again I wake up in sorrow
Another person, another day
I probably won't remember it anyway, well...
Seems like the world is leaving me behind, when I try to explain you say I've lost my mind
You say I need some help, well how else do you think it's going to help until you you get to know it's true
No help from you
So I sit and think about the things that I'm not supposed to talk about
I think and I think and I think and I think and, never know progress
I know I'm not the only one....
WAKE UP!
Why do I wake up in the morning? - nothing has changed since the day of my birth
Why do I wake up in the morning? - I make no difference on this earth
Strength has left - has to be - something has died inside of me
If I don't wake up in the morning - at my funeral world anyone even care?
If I don't wake up in the morning - would anyone even be there?

But now you're gonna hearing me when I shout WAKE UP
WAKE UP! (x2)
Why should I wake up in the morning? - it'll be just another wasted day
Why should I wake up in the morning? - don't do nothing right anyway
That was then - not anymore - now I go blasting out the door
I'm gonna wake up in the morning - I'll prove you wrong I will not fail
I'm gonna wake up in the morning - I'm gonna blaze a brand new trail
Might not be smart, but if I'm strong
I know for sure that no one ever will prove me wrong
