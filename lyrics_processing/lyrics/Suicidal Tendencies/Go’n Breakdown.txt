Por vida y por muerte Holmes
Breakdown
A motherfuckin' breakdown
Breakdown
Ain't that a bitch?
If you like magic, here's a trick
Snap my fingers now I'm a lunatic (Breakdown)
Ain't no threat, straight out fact
Go head up and you'll get jacked (Breakdown)
Went to school at U. of Hell
Favorite course was kill and tell
Graduated head of class
Majored in kickin' ass
Did hard time to get my Master
Wrote the book on personal disaster
I don't need no PhD to be a doctor of fuckin' misery
Psycho's insane, they say I lost my brain
But I g-g-g-g-gave it away
If my mind's gone bad, don't go off feeling sad
'Cause I ch-ch-ch-ch-chose it that way
You might also like'Cause it's a breakdown, I'm gon' breakdown
I'm gonna break, ain't no you can do
'Cause it's a breakdown, a motherfuckin' breakdown
Gonna break you in fuckin' two
What you got? Come and show me
Think I won't, you don't know me
Live or die, it's all the same
Life or death, it's just a game
Make you an offer you can't refuse
Pull out the gat, sorry, you lose
Put a disclaimer on the crypt
Sorry Holmes, finger slipped
I broke a main, now it's headed for my brain
And my m-m-mind goes thumpty thump thump (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pinned shot eyes, don't come as no surprise
It ain't no dance, the bump and the dump
'Cause it's a breakdown, I'm gon' breakdown
I'm gonna break, ain't no you can do
'Cause it's a breakdown, gonna breakdown
Who said that nightmares don't come true?
Breakdown

Breakdown
Stick out your hand, I'll stick out my finger
Kick you in the balls, now you're a soprano singer (Breakdown)
Rush to my head, whacked and hyper
Now it's time to pay the piper (Breakdown)
Time to pay the piper
Thought you were smart, now you're lying in a cart
And you're resting six feet below
Your reservations ain't got no hesitations
You don't need to pack no bag where you go (No)
Breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown
I'm gonna break, ain't no you can do (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause it's a breakdown, a motherfuckin' breakdown
I'm gonna break you in fuckin' two
Cruise the streets on a hustle
Show 'em what's up, flex the muscle
Whacked-out mind on a roll
Leaving behind a violent toll
Don't take no chemist to understand the equation
AK47, a little persuasion
Your fear is like my compliment
Now you're the production of my environment
Don't flap no lip, don't shoot that crap
Timebomb for brain, don't know when I snap (Breakdown)
My strategy, I do a psycho attack
You know my set, I'm a maniac (Breakdown)
Do as they say when in Rome
Blast the sucka then get home (Breakdown)
Concussion to the skull, jugular severed
Chalk it up, another 187 (Breakdown)
Breakdown

Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
