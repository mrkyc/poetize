Sick of people (No one's real)
Sick of chicks (They're all bitches)
Sick of you (You're too hip)
Sick of life (It sucks)

Ah! Suicide's an alternative!

Sick of trying (What's the point?)
Sick of talking (No one listens)
Sick of listening (It's all lies)
Sick of thinking (Just end up confused)
Sick of moving (Get me anywhere)
Sick of myself (Don't wanna live)
Sick and tired (And no one cares)
Sick of life (It sucks)

Well, I've got a little story to tell
About a man, said he came from hell
He said Satan's been lookin', especially after me
He said Satan's got a paper, gonna set my body free
He said, "Power and glory, bitches and screwing
All in your name, and all for you to stay"
Oh yeah
"Power be your name, glory and fame
I see the gold and all of the riches in your head"
Oh yeah

He said, "Power, fame, all in your name
All that you wanted, all that you need
All that you want to answer your dream
Anything that you ever could need"

"Just sign the paper, that's all you do
Just sign the paper, it's ready to
Anything down here, it's all for you
Just sign the paper"

Uh, let me see if I got this right
When I sign the paper, then I get all these things?
It's gotta be something else happening
I don't know, man
Besides, it's like not worth it
Well, I don't care too much about gold
And I don't really give a fuck about what you've been told
And I don't really care, or need anyone looking after me
