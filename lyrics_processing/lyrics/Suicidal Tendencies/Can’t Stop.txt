There's a place I try to go
So far from here
I close my eyes, I try to
To disappear
I look around in my own way but what I see I never
Never really know
I wander 'round until I feel it coming on and then it's
It's time to go
I don't want to be here
Falling out of place
Confusion's the consensus
Fighting for my space

And then you make me open my eyes
And you come back
All I wanted was some time
Some time to think
That's all I needed
I would have been okay
With just a little time
My time, not your time
You never have time
I don't even know why I try
You're probably here right now waiting
Waiting for that moment to ambush me
Slightin' my hopes
Crush my confidence
Pound me down
Pound me down lower than you ever have before
Just so you can grab my heart and rip it out
And then you chew on it, spit it out and throw it on the ground and stomp all over it
Laughing, laughing hysterically
Daring me to do something
Knowing that I won't, knowing that I can't
Knowing that you're me and I'm you
And I could never hate you as much as you hate me
Knowing the weaker I get, the stronger you are
Knowing how weak I am, knowing how strong you are

Can't stop the running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me

I lived it, I live it, it's not easy to say
I felt it, I feel it, it's just another day
It scares me, why does it dare me
You know it ain't a fair fight
Rain overtakes me, it tries to break me
You know that something ain't right

Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Set my body free

They don't make no seatbelt for the mind
So I can't fasten up for this ride
Running away
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Not right, can't fight
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Fighting, hiding
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Hypnotized, paralyzed
Can't stop the runaway emotions
I was scared, I am scared
I know it but I'm not afraid to admit it
See, being scared that don't bother me it's just a feeling
I can deal with that, I know what it is
It's what I don't know, what I can't feel
That's what bothers me, that's what really scares me
See, right now, I'm scared, really scared
'Cause I can't feel
Emotionally paralyzed, light-headed
Like, you know when you gotta pass out?
Actually, I wish I would
You know, kinda like when you gotta sneeze
The relief it brings
Just waiting, waiting for something to happen
Waiting for that moment, keeping you 
It takes you nowhere
Nowhere's where I'm at right now
Nowhere's where you're at
Nowhere's what you bring to me
Nowhere's like an itch you can't scratch
Like an itch in the brain
But when you finally figure out a way to scratch it
It just itches more

Can't stop the running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
I hate it, I hate me
Like my consistency
I've seen it, I see it
I'm talking literally
So much lying, too much denying
It's time to face the facts
You can't help me, these cards were dealt me
Play out the final act

Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Set my body free

Oh, no
You really done it this time
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Can't stop the runaway emotions

There's a place I try to go, so far from here
