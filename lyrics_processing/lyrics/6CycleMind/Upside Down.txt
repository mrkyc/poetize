I've been spending some time, thinking I'd be alright
Don't know if I could really make it tonight
Lie awake in the dark, come down then I start
Thinking about you is almost breaking my heart
I don't know where I went wrong or what's going on
Baby, I feel like our love's lost tonight
Should I stay, should I go, well, I really don't know
Lately, I've been missing you so

Baby, you don't understand
Our love lies lost
But you're still holding my hand
Oh, and then you walk away
Just tonight I want you to stay

You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down

Every time I hurt you, well, it's hurting me too
Don't know if I could really stay here tonight
Tired of thinking of you, and everything that you do
Tell me what am I supposed to do
Well, I just wanted to say that I need you today
Tell me it's all gonna work out alright
I don't know where I should start
But, with all of my heart
Baby, let me be your lover tonight
You might also like
Baby, you don't understand
Our love lies lost
But you're still holding my hand
Oh, and then you walk away
Just tonight I want you to stay

You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down

Oh, you know (You're turning me on)
You turn me upside down (You're turning around)
You know (You're turning me on)
You turn me upside down

You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down

You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on, you turn me around
