Just Blaze

Listen...
This world's a crazy place
Filled with such misery
I wipe teardrops off my face
My wife's momma's having problems
My child is having problems
Don't know how I can solve them
Now, money won't change my life
But it will make things better
Sometimes, we need to struggle
To reach for something better
Now, take charge of your own life
You may not understand me
But I'm trying to save my family

Alright
Baby, don't you cry
Alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright
I know we can make it through this
Alright
Don't let go, hold on tight
Alright
Alright
Alright

Please open up your eyes
Rise up, let's come together
Build up an enterprise
(Alright)
My black sister on the street
She makes it her own business
To sell her precious body

Her baby has to eat
So don't hate her for her choices
How do you think she feels inside?
Yeah, yeah

Alright
Baby, don't you cry
Alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright
I know we can make it through this
Alright
Don't let go, hold on tight
Alright
