Here's to the judges of John Roberts
Who wear the robe of honor in a phony legal form
And justices are stranger when the partisans report
When the court elected a president it was the beginning of this war

Here's to the land you tore out the heart of

Here's to the government of Dick Cheney
With criminals posing as advisers to the crown

Gonzalez find yourself another country to be part of

Here's to the land you tore out the heart of
George W find yourself another country to be part of
Here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
