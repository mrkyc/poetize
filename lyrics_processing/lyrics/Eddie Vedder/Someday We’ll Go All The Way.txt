For I've seen other teams, and it's never the same
When you're born in Chicago, you're blessed and you're healed
The first time you walk into Wrigley Field
Our heroes with pinstripes and heroes in blue
Give us the chance to feel like heroes too
Whether we'll win and if we should lose
We know someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
We are one with the Cubs
With the Cubs we're in love
Hold our heads high as the underdogs
We are not fairweather, but foul weather fans
Like brothers in arms, in the streets and the stands
There's magic in the ivy and the old scoreboard
The same one I stared at as a kid keeping score
In a world full of greed, I could never want more
And someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
Well, someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
And here's to the men and the legends we've known
Teaching us faith and giving us hope
United we stand, and united we'll fall
Down to our knees the day we win it all
Yeah Ernie Banks said, "Oh, let's play two!"
I think he meant two hundred years
In the same ballpark, our diamond, our jewel
The home of our joy and our fears
Keeping traditions, and wishes made new
The place where our grandfathers' fathers they grew
The spiritual feeling if I ever knew
And if you ain't been, I am sorry for you
And when the day comes for that last winning run
And I'm crying and covered in beer
I look to the sky and know I was right today
Someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way
