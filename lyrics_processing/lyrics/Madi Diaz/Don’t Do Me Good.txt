Without the better days, the one-step-closer phase
Who on earth would I be?
Without the sleepless nights, when I turn out the lights
Would you recognize me?

It's gettin' harder and harder to breathe underwater
When I know that you'll take me down

Every time I try to walk away, I stay, you knew I would
I know lovin' you, it don't do me good
Every time I wake up cryin', I'm denyin' what I should
I know lovin' you, it don't do me good
It don't do me good
It don't do me good
It don't do me good

Without the make-believe, the "what will be" will be
What gives me the right to keep dreamin'?
Without the dark, maybe there will be no stars
Just broken floating parts for us to believe in

It's gettin' harder and harder to act like I'm smarter
And tell you I know somethin' I don't
You might also like
Every time I try to walk away, I stay, you knew I would
I know lovin' you, it don't do me good
Every time I wake up cryin', I'm denyin' what I should
I know lovin' you, it don't do me good

I keep comin' back
And I keep comin' back to you
Keep comin' back to you
Keep comin' back to you
Oh, and I deal with the fact
That you won't give it back like I do
Mm

Every time I try to walk away, I stay, you knew I would
I know lovin' you, it don't do me good
And every time I wake up cryin', I'm denyin' what I should
I know lovin' you, it don't do me good
Every time I try to walk away, I stay, you knew I would
I know lovin' you, it don't do me good
Every time I wake up cryin', I'm denyin' what I should
I know lovin' you, it don't do me good
It don't do me good
