Every night, you stay with me
You stay with me, I let you inside
So you can lie and cheat
Oh, you're always gonna lie and cheat
I don't mind, I like the way
You never leave, you draw the shades
So you can lie and cheat
Oh, you're always gonna lie and cheat

Then you're gone and I'm alone
The time is going on and on

You're gone, I'm drinking 'cause I lost my keys
I'm broke, locked out of my house
Can you please stop calling my phone
And playing with me?
Now you're trying to come back
And mess with me
Oh, no, trying to come on back
And mess with me

I've been sitting around all day
I never pick a different place
You know just where to look
I'm as easy as an open book
I stay right where you left me
Don't go wandering, 'cause you like me that way
You like me that way
Don't lie, you like me that way
You might also like
Then you're gone and I'm alone
And time is going on and on

You're gone, I'm drinking 'cause I lost my keys
I'm broke, locked out of my house
Can you please stop calling my phone
And playing with me?
Now you're trying to come back
And mess with me
Oh, no, trying to come on back
And mess with me

I like it better when you go
When you go
When you go
When you
I like it better when you go
When you go
When you go
When you go

Then you're gone and I'm alone
And time is going on and on
You're gone, I'm drinking 'cause I lost my keys
I'm broke, locked out of my house
Can you please stop calling my phone
And playing with me?
Now you're trying to come back
And mess with me
Oh, no, trying to come on back
And mess with me

Gone, I'm drinking 'cause I lost my keys
I'm broke, locked out of my house
Can you please stop calling my phone
And playing with me?
Now you're trying to come back
And mess with me
Oh, no, trying to come on back
And mess with me
Now you're trying to come back
And mess with me
Oh, no, trying to come on back
