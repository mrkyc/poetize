Don't wanna say nothing so I don't react
No, I don't even notice you
You in the kitchen and me in the bath
Yeah, I can't play normal and you can't pretend
That I don't know where you go
I know where you go, I know where you go
I hope you fuck her with your eyes closed
And think of me
I hope you love her with the lights low
And think of me
I hope you fuck her with your eyes closed
Put the shame off with some Benzos
Swallow the feeling while you walk home
And think of me always
Think of me, think of me always
And think of me
And think of me
Think of me, think of me always
Think of me, think of me always
Think of me
Think of me

I'm sorry, I love you is noise that you make
No, I didn't even notice you
Stayin' out, stayin' out all night
Running your fingers down her thighs
Lickin' your lips in the low light
No, I didn't even notice you
I hope you fuck her with your eyes closed
And think of me
I hope you love her with the lights low
Oh, and think of me
I hope you fuck her with your eyes closed
Put the shame off with some Benzos
Swallow the feeling while you walk home
And think of me always
Think of me, think of me always
And think of me
And think of me
Think of me, think of me always
Think of me, think of me always
And think of me
And think of me
Think of me, think of me always
Think of me always
