I just want you all alone
Standing in the danger zone
I don't want nobody else
I just want you to myself

Pull me in close
Hold me tight
Hold me tight

Shadows moving everywhere
Can we play that song again?
Everybody's watching us
I don't give who's looking when you

Pull me in close
Hold me tight
Through the night

Tell me what you wanna do
I was thinking when it all comes through
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
You might also like
I just wanna dance real close in the dark
With you (With you)
I just wanna dance real close in the dark
With you (With you)
Let the smoke keep rising up from the floor
Let the lights come down and close all the doors
Dancing close in the dark
With you (With you)

Nothing's running through my mind
I don't have to think about
How I should control myself
If I should be going out

Pull me in close
Hold me tight
Hold me tight

Tell me what you wanna do
I was thinking when it all comes through
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
I just wanna dance real close in the dark
With you (With you)
I just wanna dance real close in the dark
With you (With you)
Let the smoke keep rising up from the floor
Let the lights come down and close all the doors
Dancing close in the dark
With you (With you)

With you
Let the lights come down and close all the doors
Let the lights come down and close all the doors
Let the lights come down and close all the doors
Let the lights come down and close all the doors

I just wanna dance real close in the dark
With you (With you)
I just wanna dance real close in the dark
With you (With you)
Let the smoke keep rising up from the floor
Let the lights come down and close all the doors
Dancing close in the dark
