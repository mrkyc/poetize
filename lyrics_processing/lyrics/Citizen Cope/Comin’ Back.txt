Put his bag in the back of his black Cadillac Coupe DeVille
He had a meeting at the crossroad
But he didn't know that his soul was about to get killed
You can leave me lonely
You can take my riches
You can take my life, but my soul been saved
He felt the cut of a sword, but the pen's mightier
Then he spread his wings and he flew away, Yeah Yeah
If anything... is happening... I'm comin' back
I'm comin' back
For your ass, mother fuckin' fast is
How you be running in the day
Now you're gonna feel how
How it feels to be running when you can't get away
You can leave me lonely
You can take my riches
You can take my life, but my soul been saved
He felt the cut of a sword, but the pen's mightier
Then he spread his wings and he flew away, yeah, yeah
If anything... is happening...I'm comin' back
I'm comin' back
If anything... is happening...I'm comin' back
