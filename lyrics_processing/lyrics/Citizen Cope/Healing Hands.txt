I will never forget
Your healing hands my love
I thought my heart had stopped
Sworn I'd given up
I will never forget
Your healing hands my love
You gave me daylight
You gave me sunlight

Turn the tape recorder on
He just left Jackie O for Marilyn Monroe
We're all bought and sold
For tobacco, firearms, and alcohol
What's a pocket full of gold
Without a woman that you could hold
Can't afford to be a back burner no more
Now we got a lot of places to go

The actions of a few
Have put a world in harms way
And history has proven
That they killed our leaders dead
You might also likeAnd I don't know about a right and wrong
I got a muse from the east to the west
All I know is if I never said it before
I'm gonna to say it with my last breath


Find something you can sell
Set you on a trail
Have a ball and a bell
Buy a ticket out of Hell
Not as far as I could tell
Very Well
Bubba I'm a bust your tail
My uncle Clarence hit the hammer with the nail
Wash your hands before you come to the meal
Cut out the light cause it comes with a bill

The violence of a few
Have put a world in harms way
And history has proven
That they killed our leaders dead
And I don't know about a right and wrong
I got a muse from the east to the west
All I know is if I never said it before
I'm gonna to say it with my last breath


I will never forget
Your healing hands my love
I thought my heart had stopped
Sworn I'd given up
I will never forget
Your healing hands my love
You gave me daylight
You gave me twilight
