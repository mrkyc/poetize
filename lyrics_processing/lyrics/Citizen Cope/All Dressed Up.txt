I couldn't get enough of her
She's out on the town and she's all dressed up
I couldn't get enough of her
She walked into the room and the place lit up
I couldn't get enough of her
Distance is lifting me up
I couldn't get enough of her love
I couldn't get enough of her
Here's a song for you I play
From all of my life, from all of my days
Life is short but the summer is long
And we could get together a lot before the fall
And when you get near, close enough to hear, my mind just settles
The thoughts just clear
And I could touch you right
And I could rush you right and
Them walls gonna fall like the full moon-light
Yeah Yeah
She's weighin' on my mind and it won't let up
I couldn't get enough of her
She's out on the town and she's all dressed up
I couldn't get enough of her
She walked into the room and the place lit up
I couldn't get enough of her
Distance is lifting me up
I couldn't get enough of her love
I couldn't get enough of her
