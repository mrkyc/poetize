She had left him lost and broken
Like no other had before
And now his heart was just a token
Of all the pain it had endured

And his memories were clouded
With all the hurtful things she'd said
Yes, for all intent and purpose
He might just as well been dead

And some people claim they still hear him call her name
"Hey, hey, Maureen," swear they hear it just that plain
Deep in the night and sometimes right at dawn
See, his body died some years ago, but around here
Mr. Johnson's love lives on

He seemed far away and distant
With that cold and silent stare
Never moving, never speaking
And just barely breathing air

No one really knew her reason
And who can judge her, right or wrong?
The only true and solemn fact is
The man we'd known was all but gone

"Hey, hey, Maureen," swear they hear it just that plain

Mr. Johnson's love lives on

Sissy Thompson said she'd seen him
Late that night on Shelby Road
About a mile from there, they found him
It seems he'd died out in the snow

I hear'd the preacher at the service
Say from love he's finally free
But I say love, it knows no season
It haunts the soul eternally

And some people claim they still hear him call her name
"Hey, hey, Maureen," swear they hear it just that plain
Deep in the night and sometimes right at dawn
See, his body died some years ago, but around here
Mr. Johnson's love lives on
Yes, his body died some years ago, but around here
