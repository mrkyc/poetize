They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that laid a-waiting in those cities' factories
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery

Have you ever been down Kentucky way
Say south of Prestonsburg?
Have you ever been up in a holler
And have you ever heard
A mountain man cough his life away
From diggin' that black coal
In those dark mines, those dark mines?
If you had, you might just understand
The reason that they left it all behind

They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that laid a-waiting in those cities' factories
They learned readin', writin', roads to the north
To the luxury and comfort a coal miner can't afford
They thought readin', writin', Route 23
Would take them to the good life that they had never seen
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery

Have you ever seen 'em
Put the kids in the car after work on Friday night
Pull up in a holler about 2 AM
And see a light still burnin' bright
Those mountain folks sat up that late
Just to hold those little grandkids
In their arms, in their arms
And I'm proud to say that I've been blessed
And touched by their sweet hillbilly charm

They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that laid a-waiting in those cities' factories
They learned readin', writin', roads to the north
To the luxury and comfort a coal miner can't afford
They thought readin', writin', Route 23
Would take them to the good life that they had never seen
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery

Yeah, it turns out that that old highway
Leads you to a world of misery
They found out that that old highway
