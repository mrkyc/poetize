We wouldn't wonder, not at all
How much fun each day was gonna be
If I had a mountain top
I know we would never stop
Climbing way high up to look and see
If I had a jellyfish
I betcha we would never miss
A single peanut butter kiss or squeeze
If I had a waterfall
It might not make no sense at all
But that won't matter much to you and me
Babies get born, even in a war
I guess just to show us, what livin's for
And my heart still believes that love
For what we need can be enough
If we'll just stop keepin' score
If I had a big giraffe
That tried to dance and made us laugh
Every smile and giggle would be free

We'd turn it back on every night
Just so the dark could try and get some sleep
And if I had a rocket ship
We'd go places really quick
Then have the time to stop and get ice cream
If I had a big giraffe
He'd have to take a real long bath
And that's why waterfalls are really neat
Babies get born, even in a war
I guess just to show us, what livin's for
And my heart still believes that love
For what we need can be enough
If we'll just stop keepin' score
If I had an everything
We could stand out in the rain
And only feel the drops we wanted to
If I had a wonderful
We could play out in the snow
And never have to wear our socks and shoes
If I had a pot of luck
I wouldn't have to spend a buck
And get all the stuff we needed for a sneeze
If I had an everything
We wouldn't get wet in the rain
And ridin' waterfalls would be a breeze
If I had a big giraffe
He'd have to take a real long bath
