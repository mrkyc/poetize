This is dedicated to you
Ayy, bitch, I made it on my own
So tell me what you hatin' for now
To all my muhfuckin' haters (Haters)
I wrote a song just for you (Just for you)
Oh, I can see it from afar
You prayin' on my downfall

Ayy, ayy
Come and keep me company
Ayy, tell me what you want from me
I like the way you talk to me
Please don't hide the love from me
'Cause ain't nobody rude as you now
I'ma keep it true with you now
I don't wanna ignore you
I wanna get to know you
So hit me in my DM

And tell me what you're going through
I ain't trying to disappoint you
I'm trying to be a better me

The jealousy ain't a friend of me
No negatives, it don't live in me

I pulled up in a foreign car for you
I probably do it all for you
Jimmy Choo from your palm to your shoes
Lamborghini Urus is Aqua blue
Anytime I pulled up on you
It's just to fuck on you
Fuck it, slide up on you
I might slide up on you
I don't even like lovin', mmh
But I like kissin' and fuckin', mmh, yeah
And you just like me, mmh
Actin' all goody in public, mmh, yeah
If you just hold it down
If you keep it real, I'ma hold you down
Yah, I make a lot of earnings now
If you wanna learn, let me show you how
Mmm, this is my life
Love me or just love my lifestyle
Love me, don't you love my lifestyle?
I swear I get higher than clouds
And I swear I'm missin' you like right now
Even though I been a dog, I been a hound
Use to ride a bike, but now my cars go roar
Me and you are just alike but different styles
And this for
To all my muhfuckin' haters
This is dedicated to you
Ayy, bitch, I made it on my own (My own)
So tell me what you hatin' for now (Tell me why you're hatin' on me)

So tell me what you hatin' for (Tell me why you're trippin' on me for)
