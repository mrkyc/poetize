Hello? Ayy

Do you wanna roll? Know you came for something (Ayy)
Do you wanna roll? Know you came lookin' for something (Huh)
Do you wanna roll? (Ayy) Are you down to smoke? (Ayy)
I be gettin' lifted (Switch), Lamborghini doors
So you wanna roll? Know you came for something (Ayy)
Do you wanna roll? Know you came lookin' for something (Come on)
Do you wanna roll? (Ayy) Are you down to smoke? (Ayy)
I be gettin' lifted, baby, let me know

'Cause we could take it slow, do it any tempo
Anything you tell me, copy that like a 10-4
You taste so sweet, purple kisses got me thirsty (Uh)
Let me take a dive, Underwater, now we surfin' (Ayy)
Rollin' on the bed, down, down to the floor (Doin')
Don't it feel good? Baby, we be goin' on and on (Yah)
In the mid-song (Ayy), in the mid-song (Ayy)
She been drippin' like a shower
Shit, I can feel it's gettin' warmer
I've been waitin' way too long, girl
I wanna take you home
Like right after this song
Baby, baby

Just the mood so right
So what's up?

I got the whip slowed down (Smoke, smoke, smoke)
Wind blowin' in her hair
Yeah, I ride it with the windows down, feels alright
I got the whip slowed down (Smoke, smoke, smoke)
The wind blowin' in her hair
Yeah, I ride it with the windows down, it's super loud (Yah)
So baby, get the lighter (Yah, yah), take it in, let it fill ya
Higher than Alaska, don't be scared to let it hit ya (Nah)
I can't leave you alone, oh, no, no, no, no
Feelin' so true, I gotta have you all on my own
It's you, you, you, you, I wanna love you
First night with me, take it slow
You say you never smoked, uh-huh-uhh
You know you dead wrong
So relax and take notes, uh-huh-uhh
While I take tokes (Tokes, tokes)
