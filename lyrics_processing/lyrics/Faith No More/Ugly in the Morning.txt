You did one thing wrong
You woke up
It looked better before
More, more!

And the stomach turns
Say nothing without wastin' a word
I know exactly what you meant!
I know how piggy feels
He starves without missin' a meal
Look in the mirror

Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!

When the headache is gone
The sun is not
Forgot to turn the alarm
On, on!

Doesn't matter how much you think
Or the number of your hairs in the sink
I did it to myself again
I know how piggy feels
He starves without missin' a meal
Look in the mirror

Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!

Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!

Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning!
