You couldn't commit to wondering man
Five years of time, is this where this ends?
You said I wasted my chance, I'm falling in love
Was too busy searching for answers to songs
You're not even sure we were in love at all
And now I feel like a scout, I'm left in the dust
I pray there's a chance you're still holdin' on
A last-second bet is all that I've got
Or are we all out of luck?
Or are we all out of love?
I've been in and out of sex clubs and cheap drugs
I've been vanished from the real world, for four months
Better tell me you love me (tell me you love me)
Well, I wonder if you even recognize my face
All my friends saying I went to waste
Better tell me you love me, that saying was still something
Or are we all out of luck
Are we all out of luck?
I've been pulling fights at rest stops, with fake cops
Stayed the night over at southside, cause I'm drunk
Better tell me you love me (tell me you love me)
Again the day I overslept, so sleep less
Said it wasn't time to get yet, no they're mad
Better tell me you love me

Just to tell you how it was but I never said
Oh no no no, oh no no
And still I wonder if you'd even recognize my face
Maybe I let it all go to waste
Better tell me you love me (please don't leave me)
Are we all out of luck?
Are we all out of luck?
Are we all out of luck?
Are we all out of luck?
I've been in and out of sex clubs and cheap drugs
I've been vanished from the real world, for four months
Better tell me you love me (tell me you love me)
I've been pulling fights at rest stops, with fake cops
Stayed the night over at southside, cause I'm drunk
Better tell me you love me (tell me you love me)
Are we all out of luck?
Are we all out of luck?
Are we all out of luck?
