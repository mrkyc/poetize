And oh good Lord
Think I'm buried in too deep
And all my luck
Has been making faces at me
I lost my girl
And my spunk
All in the same week
And I said oh, oh, oh
That liquid action be temptin' me

Let's bounce
All night
We're turning off my memory
Oh, this club
Is our house
Will my momma ever forgive me?
I wanna be cheered up
I want drinks all around
I wanna break my rules
I wanna rock this town

And oh
Well shame on me
And I guess the snake got free
'Cause we got the poison on our tongues

Man, I clearly lost my track
And all day long
I've been trying to straighten my act
I dropped my phone, in a rush
And I swear that I just snapped
And I said oh, oh, no
Man Imma imma imma
Be stumblin' right back

Let's bounce
All night
We're turning off my memory
This club
Is our house
Will my momma ever forgive me?
I'm wanna be cheered up
I want drinks all around
I'm wanna break my rules
I wanna rock this town

And oh
Well shame on me
And I guess the snake got free
'Cause we got the poison, the poison
Oh, well blame it on me
And I guess the snake got free
'Cause we got the poison on our tongues
(Poison on our tongues)
(We got the poison on our tongues)

We got the poison on our tongues (x4)
And oh
Well I guess the snake got free
'Cause we got the poison, the poison
Oh, well shame on me
And I guess the snake got free
'Cause we got the poison on our
Oh, oh blame it on me
And I guess the snake got free
