Still right there from the day we broke apart
And baby I tried, but I couldn't let you go
You were tied to me like an anchor to my soul
Ooh, all I wanna know
If there's anything left of everything we had
Is there a small chance you'd ever want me back
Can you tell me right now should I unlock the door
Or will you come in the way you did before
Ooh, just like you did before
Is there anything left of everything we had
Well have I crossed your mind in the middle of the day
Do you sweep it under rugs just to make it go away
Did you leave us in the past where you're too afraid to go
If it hurts too much, baby just say so
Ooh, I just wanna know
If there's anything left of everything we had
Is there a small chance you'd ever want me back
Can you tell me right now should I unlock the door
Or will you come in the way you did before
Ooh, just like you did before
Is there anything left of everything we had
Oh anything at all
Anything you still feel
Oh anything at all
Anything that's still real
I got all this love deep down in my heart
Still right there from the day we broke apart
Hey baby I tried, but I couldn't let you go
You were tied to me like an anchor to my soul
Ooh, all I wanna know
Ooh, all I wanna know
If there's anything left of everything we had
Is there a small chance you'd ever want me back
Can you tell me right now should I unlock the door
Or will you come in the way you did before
Ooh, just like you did before
Is there anything left of everything we had
Oh, is there anything left of everything we had
Oh anything at all
Anything at all
Oh anything at all
Anything at all
