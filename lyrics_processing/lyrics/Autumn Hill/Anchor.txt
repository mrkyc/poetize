Settled hard, no it don't need to roam
We were two ships in the night
On the coast to collide
Like someone drew an arrow in the sky
Let's drop our anchor here
Where these hearts has steered
Turn our search lights off
'Cause we're no longer lost
Let's hang a little sign that says
"Home is where the heart is"
Right here with you
So baby let's just stop
And drop our anchor here
Anchor here
Drop our anchor here
Anchor here
We got a foundation made of stone
And the sky's so high, full of the unknown
Like looking in a stranger's eyes
And suddenly you recognize
What you've been trying to find your whole life
Let's drop our anchor here
Where these hearts has steered
Turn our search lights off
'Cause we're no longer lost
Let's hang a little sign that says
"Home is where the heart is"
Right here with you
So baby let's just stop
And drop our anchor here
Anchor here
Drop our anchor here
Anchor here
