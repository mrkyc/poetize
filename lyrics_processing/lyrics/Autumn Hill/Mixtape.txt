I handed it to you then walked away
I kicked it off with "Wonderwall"
A little "In Your Eyes", "November Rain"
R.E.M. singing "Everybody Hurts"
But nobody hurts like the first love gone
I sing along, I sing along
I sing along, oh yeah
I remember pressing rewind to feel it one more time
And playing over and over all your favourite songs
And I was making them mine, yeah
I know you loved me, I know you did
Everything that I wanted to say, yeah
I put it on a mixtape
And that memory ain't going away 'cause I've got it on a mixtape
Yeah, yeah, uh uh
I wore it out all summer long
Side A, Side B, whatever one it started on
Behind my bedroom door
Listen on my own with the headphones on
I remember pressing rewind to feel it one more time
And playing over and over all your favourite songs
And I was making them mine, yeah
I know you loved me, I know you did
Everything that I wanted to say, yeah
I put it on a mixtape
And that memory ain't going away 'cause I've got it on a mixtape
Yeah, yeah, uh uh
You might also likeA Memorex with a handwritten note
Every title, every word you wrote
One listen and it's like I go right back to you
I remember pressing rewind to feel it one more time
And playing over and over all your favourite songs
And I was making them mine, yeah
I know you loved me, I know you did
Everything that I wanted to say, yeah
I put it on a mixtape
And that memory ain't going away 'cause I've got it on a mixtape
Turn the stereo up and push play
I've got it on a mixtape, ain't never gonna throw it away
No, I've got it on a mixtape, alright
