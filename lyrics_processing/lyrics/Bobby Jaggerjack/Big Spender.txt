Good looking, so refined
Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind?
So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey, big spender!
Spend a little time with me

These hoes think that because of that pussy they are entitled to bread
But with me you got to suck that dick and lick them balls, super head
I got some hoes on speed dial and they ready to come through
And if I was you I'd hide my bitch because I might have her fuck me too
Then pckkk on her face it's a fucking disgrace
These hoes will let you get away with anything as long as your cash is right
And you ask right, her ass tight, and her body small
My dick my big, and my body tall
That's one hell of a combination like big titty bitches and volleyball
I like white girls, hi girls, my girls, they like girls
This guy asked me who I was fucking and then he said that's my girl
Too bad, oh well, she's occupying my ball sack and I'm the type of nigga to fuck you bitch and never call back


If you want to spend big then you better have a job
And if not you could suck my corn on the cob
That's code name for my ding-a-ling
And I ain't buying anything for no ho, no Yolo, you can choke on my pogo
If you ask me for some cash then imma drop you no yo-yo
I'd uppercut a nigga no bus driver, bird that was a cold reference, short, smart, yellow and bad
Man that's my hope
I stay in the pussy no tampon and I whoop a nigga ass no Anton Fisher
You know I will not hesitate if a bitch is bad then I'm gonna get her
Cut and dry it's that simple
When I fuck I like to see back dimples so let me hit that from behind
Record that porno then hit rewind
I'm a pervert, I got a nasty mind
Ew Ricky Bobby nasty
And if them ho's is looking for some bread then they better walk past me

I guess it's only right that I do third verse
My dick's in the planet and I'd fuck Mother Earth
That means I do an old trick but that's two percent now that's old dick
And then she could swallow my milky juices A.K.A. my kids
That means I'm a bust a nut on her bottom lip and then dip
God damn I'm such a man whore but I ain't never lied about it
I got a girlfriend now so I guess I really can't talk about it
But shhhh... be quiet
It's time to tell a secret, Bobby Jagger Jack is that nigga that your girlfriends been sleeping with
Like the little fat kid from the Simpsons
Hah hah I'm laughing at you, now pause and I'm chilling too
And I think it's time you except the truth, you know it and I know it too
