And it came with a notice that told me
That I should kill this beat
When I heard that bass and that pacing
My heart was racing, so i took it into the booth
And then I gave that bitch a face lift
So where's my scalpel at people
This is a surgery
The beat was looking up at me like;
"Bobby, MURDER ME!"
Who am I
To deny
A request to put a body bag in play
So I kill these beats with a capitol K
And have a funeral on that exact same day!
You son of a gun
I do this for fun
I kick it with women
They give me the buns
The BOOTY
I get it from cuties
Like the ones in the movies
And imma keep it 100 with you, I do not have a whole lot of bread
So imma kill every beat I hop on, and drop a whole lot of muthafuckin bombs instead, MY NIGGA! (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
I curse a lot, and I don't give a shit, but they give me shit, for not giving a shit, and that's ass backwards, like a double standard
Everybody better put their muthafuckin hands up right now, cuz I've got a gun in my hand and a bag in the other, and I'm about to go and rob Hip-Hop right NOW!
I've got my mask on, and I'm ready for war
So imma go inside my closet, and pull out a sword
To cut the muthafuckin heads off all my enemies
To show the whole world that they are NOT what they pretend to be
The wolf inside the hen house
I was meant to be
The predator and the prey
The rest is history
I brought that circus into town without the ticket fee
And ghost rode with the whip
And brought the heat with me
And then I tuck that burner inside of my waist
And if a person has a problem
Relocate it to his face
And let it sit, so now he has some time to pick and choose
We can either squash the beef, or he can end up on the news
(Awe shit, god damn)
But you gotta decide today though
I couldn't afford the silencer
So I went to go buy a potato
My shenanigans are real, and I'm ready for shit to pop off
I'm bodying this beat, now call the morgue and set up a drop-off
And hop off
My muthafuckin dick
I done spared too many people, but I'm done with all that shit
It's okay to be a monster and give it something to eat
They done went and poked a lion and woke it up out it's sleep
And I was sitting here waiting for my city to get behind me
But instead I think I'll move to a place where they cannot find me
Imma relocate to L.A., New York, or another city
Instead of sitting in a place where they're not even fucking with me
I'm a lone wolf!
And I've been putting in this work since I started
And if anybody tells you different, then they're fucking retarded
And I apologize for using that derogatory statement
But I couldn't help myself, because they must be mental patients
If they think that I'm not about to do damage
All this rapping I have done has worked up an appetite
Need me a sammich
And a girl with big titties to make it for me
And if they want me to give up the mic, they'll have to take it from me, and I'm not giving it UP!
