Hey, listen, I'm the bad guy to the bad guys
And I ain't ever about to hit a woman
But I'll whoop your ass if you're that guy
I be looking for a fight, but everybody wanna shoot
These niggas feeling froggy, but I'm a fucking kangaroo
I hop to the heat and I pull if I gotta
These niggaa talking and think I won't pop em
You're wrong nigga, like this ain't a song nigga
You can get your melon popped, if you're talking wrong nigga
So you should get on nigga, cuz I'm the wrong nigga, flatout
Hit him in the head with a two by four and have him limpin
Come get him, I woke up and chose violence
I don't even wanna hide it, how can I hide it
I got it honest, that's what my momma say
But y'all need to move, cuz we need a change, ain't that what Obama say, but y'all at a standstill, no beat that I can't kill
And I walked in this bitch and I'm feeling myself
Because I know I am real, can you say the same? (Huh)
That ain't none of my business, speaking like a politician
I ain't about to get up in it, Switzerland with the swiftness
Get up out there with the quickness, sprinting like I'm about my fitness, wait, now you know a nigga kiddin
Cuz I ain't working out all day, I ain't ever really cared about it
And I don't care what a nigga thinks, but you other muthafuckahs scared about it, now whats that gonna do for me? (HUH)
Not a god damn thing, and if you get in front of my way
OOOOOOOH I SWEAR TO GAWD NIGGA
That I will send you to meet him, with a letter that says "From Rob Nigga", so you better go and do yourself a favor
Get a job nigga and stay out the streets, I stay with the heat
Imma ride with a full clip, never on "E"
I'm the bad guy to the bullshit, so fuck the opps and who they're cool with, and specificity is necessary when you're tryna let a nigga know that your momma didn't raise a hoe and you're about to punch him in the fucking throat! (AHHHH), don't give a fuck what these niggas be talking about under their breath, cuz I swear to Rob
That I will get busy, and go in their house and then make a mess
So don't hate on me, cuz it'll stay with me, don't play with me
I've got a problem letting shit go, man I swear to gawd I might just spaz on everybody in this hoe!
You might also like(Oooooh shit, I gotta breathe bro, I think I need to call a therapist
I think I might have a fucking problem, I'm dead serious bro, cut the music, this is a message, if you're listening to this shit and you're about to go fuck something up... SIT YOUR ASS DOWN NIGGA!
SIT DOWN NIGGA, IF YOU'RE DRIVING SOMEWHERE
