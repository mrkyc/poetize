(Let's Go)
I was having a conversation with Chris, when he told me to drop
Another record and here it is, then I jumped inside the booth and I
Started to make a hit, Imma send it to 107, like you better play this
Cuz y'all muthafuckahs be playing everybody but your own folk, a bunch of little niggas fucking with the grown folks, and all I really wanna do is drop the heat, so Imma duck the radio politics and fuck with the streets
I self released, every single record I done ever made nigga, so I'm keeping every dollar that I'm paid nigga, and I ain't worried about them records that you made nigga, cuz the heat I drop will put you in a grave nigga
Dropping bodies, so the competition needs nine lives, the hood be fucking with me, no need to give out no high fives
When I get antisocial I won't fuck with you, but if you bother me anyway then my gun will fuck with you!
Or I might hit you in the head with a ball bat, and have your momma crying when she gets the call that, they got a body at the morgue and they think that's her son, that's what you get when you think running them streets is for fun!
And how come everybody wanna be a thug now, and everybody else is fucking with them drugs now, and you should probably keep all that shit away from me, cuz I'm not trying to worry about what they could take from me
And I just wanna stay away from all the bullshit, and only kick it with the people that I'm cool with, but I can't take everybody, you niggas can't go, so I guess that's why them pussy niggas hating though!
(OK), I gotta be honest I don't really like where I'm from, like how can a bunch of niggas compete, when they're all bums and that's the current situation in my city, like 93% of you niggas in here are shitty, and fucking with me, is like owing money to 50, got a couple people ready to kill you that's coming with me
(You a dead man)
But I ain't catching a charge, so I let them handle you and go and sit in the car! Plausible deniability your enemy, it ain't mine
You think it's cool to be a bitch, but it ain't fine
They should make "being a pussy nigga" a hate crime!
Now lock them niggas up, like a white judge, but if you offer a deal
Then you know they might budge
You might also likeYou know these niggas tellin, on everybody!
But Imma mind my business and get back to rap
Cuz I ain't got a MUTHAFUCKIN thing to do with that!
(Y'all bitch niggas ain't shit, y'all bitch y'all bitch niggas ain't shit
Tell em now, y'all bitch niggas ain't shit, y'all bitch y'all bitch niggas ain't shit, (x2)
