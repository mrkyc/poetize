Now I was about to hop up on a plane and travel to L.A.,
But I changed my mind and decided to stay in the Land today
Like why would I go out to Cali, when I can stay here in Cleveland
And give them a fucking reason to put that crown on my head
And let's keep it 100, only 6 to 7 people could be equal
But it really doesn't matter because I'll slaughter every one of y'all
And if you disagree, then you can come and see me
And I'll eat you up, pull out this potty chair and then go pee-pee
Because I kill my competition, I'm a muthafuckin murderer
I'm tryin to make it look like none of your fans have ever heard of ya
And I'm the one they're telling the stories about to scare the kids
I'm the muthafuckin BOOGEYMAN and now I'm in this bitch
And I ain't never leavin, Imma squat inside this hoe
And if you ain't fucking with me then my nigga you gotta go
Because I ain't fuckin with nobody that's tryin to kill my vibe
That's why I keep my circle Cheerio tight and I won't open up my tribe, to none of that bullshit you be talkin about (None of that bullshit you be talkin about, nah nah, none of that bullshit1)
And now I'm getting sick and tired of being stuck
So I gotta keep moving forward or Imma run out of luck
And Imma find myself stranded at this muthafuckin empasse
If the world wants to get in my way, then Imma kick it's ass
I've got a mean drive and a "Give em Hell" attitude
And y'all never supported me but I ain't even mad at you!

I don't want to go and I don't want to stay
And now I'm in the middle of a rock & hard place
When they tell me I should leave, which I could do today
I tell them I don't know, should I go or should I stay
Because I don't want to go and I don't want to stay
And now I'm in the middle of a rock & hard place
When they tell me I should leave, which I could do today
I tell them I don't know, should I go or should I stay

All I would have to do is sell everything that I own
And relocate and it really wouldn't take me that long
I could be up out of this city 24 hours tops
And catch a one-way flight to L.A., one that'll never stop
And I would have to figure out my next move when I get there
Get a day job, and a place I, could afford on a really low salary
Because living out your muthafuckin dreams ain't cheap
It really ain't that fuckin cheap, and when you do it by yourself
I swear to god that price is steep
And I've been doing that shit for that past 5 years
I put my blood in the pot, alongside tears
Because I'm down to bet it all on this rap shit
The same way the dope boys be on that trap shit
(and I'm so sick of this shit taking forever
But it don't matter where I stay at, I can do it wherever
And Imma make it on my own, whether they think I will or won't
And when I make it to the top, BITCH DON'T BE BLOWING UP MY PHONE, OH NO NO NO!)
