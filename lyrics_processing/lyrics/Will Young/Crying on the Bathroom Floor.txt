Gimme that diamond ring
Gimme that love on the movie screen
And I won't feel a thing
Promise I won't feel a thing
Gimme that kiss goodnight
Gimme a call, tell me it's alright
And I won't feel a thing
Promise I won't feel a thing

And I guess that I got rewired
'Cause you're cold as ice but it feels like fire, fire, fire, fire
And the drugs don't work and I don't know why
But when you hurt me I go higher, higher, higher, higher

But when I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
If I'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
If I'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover

Gimme your disrespect
Gimme your pain and loneliness
And I'll love you the best
Promise I'll love you the best
Gimme no peace of mind
Gimme distrust, gimme all your lies
And I'll love you for life
Promise I'll love you 'til I die

When I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
If I'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor (Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more (Give me some more)
If I'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover

I'm asking a lot of myself
I'm asking a lot of myself
It's taking a lot out of me loving you
There isn't a lot that I think I can do
And the drugs don't work and I don't know why
But when you hurt me I go higher, higher, higher, higher

But when I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
If I'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor (Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more (Give me some more)
If I'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover (Lover, lover)

I'm asking a lot of myself (I'm asking a lot of myself, I'm asking a lot of myself)
