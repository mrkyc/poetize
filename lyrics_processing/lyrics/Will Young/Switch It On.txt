I can see I'm a little unstable
Mystified, I'm tired and unable
To switch it on and switch it off daily
It's okay to say how you see me
It's about my time, there's no way

Please, this isn't working
And I can't breathe
Got no air now

How can I live when I wanna be free
This is my time and these are my needs
It's okay to want before you fall down
Setting me up on a mission of life
Got to, got to, go to go crazy
Mmm, mmm

Can you tell I'm a little bit hungry
Mr. Fabulous don't impress me
You talk to me with the speech without words
Where the vowels all missing and the truth unheard

Please, this isn't working
I can't breathe
Got no air now
It's all about the money
It's all about the fame
It's not about the way you live your life
This is how I'm gonna break it down now

How can I live when I wanna be free
This is my time and these are my needs
It's okay to want before you fall down
You're setting me up on a mission of life
Give it to me, hah

Can't you see I'm a little bit weary
In a three piece suit and shoes that don't fit me
You're bright eyed, bushy tailed, pushing it around (All you wanna do is push me around)
No, I won't let it go, no, I won't stop, so tough

How can I live when I wanna be free
This is my time and these are my needs
It's okay to want before you fall down
You're setting me up on a mission of life
How can I live when I wanna be free
This is my time and these are my needs
It's okay to want before you fall down
You're setting me up on a mission of life
You're setting me up on a mission of life
