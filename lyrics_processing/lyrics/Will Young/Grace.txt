Feeling so strange, I'm seeing you clearly now
Your beauty's deadlier every day
Oh, eh, yeah, yeah
All these people, am I the only one who found you out?
Is no one willing to say, willing to say, willing to say?

Why don't you slow down, turn your head 'round?
Been treading on hearts that are giving in with a little

Grace, you're getting away with it
Words, but nothing to say with it
You smile and take what you need
In any way that you please
Isn't it a shame?
You've nothing to show from these lies
I told you you'd pay for it
Lonely are the days of your life

You spoke in rhymes and rhythms, the sweetest sounds
They drew me in like a moth to a flame, oh
All these people you hurt along the way will haunt you now
'Cause things are going to change, going to change, going to change

Why don't you slow down, turn your head 'round?
Been treading on hearts that are giving in with a little

Grace, you're getting away with it
Words, but nothing to say with it
You smile and take what you need (Take what you need)
In any way that you please
Isn't it a shame? (Isn't it a shame?)
You've nothing to show from these lies
I told you you'd pay for it
Lonely are the days of your life (Ooh, yeah)
You're beginning to lose
Things are fading in front of your eyes
You've a long way to fall
Before you even realize
That this loneliness hurts
Lonely will be the days of your life (Ooh)
Oh-oh-oh (Ooh)

Grace, you're getting away with it
Words and nothing to say with it
You blame, but you're not ashamed of it
Hurt, you don't feel the pain of it
Lie straight in the face of it
Your mind, you should be afraid of it
Your grace, you're getting away with it
Nothing to get in my way
With a little grace, you're getting away with it
Words and nothing to say with it
Lonely are the days of your life

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Lonely are your days)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (You lie straight in the face of it)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Your mind, your mind, you should be afraid)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (You're heading for trouble)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
