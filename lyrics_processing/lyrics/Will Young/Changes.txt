I should run away, run away, run away
People say don't even go near
I can see the danger, I'm aware, I see the danger
If I go back once again it's like I learned nothing
I'm standing at the front of a queue heading for trouble
Hope it changes, hope my life changes
Gets alright somehow
Oh, I'm waiting for tomorrow
I hope it changes, can't just stay the same
Been out of luck for so long
And I don't get much so there's nothing much to lose
It's like a record going round
Yes, it's going round, going round, going round
I know I should wanna take it off
But I find it hard, why do I find it hard?
I used to have a vision
I was sitting somewhere up there
Looking down on myself doing right
For once in my life
It changes, hope my life changes
Gets alright somehow
Oh, I'm waiting for tomorrow
I hope it changes, can't just stay the same
Been out of luck for so long
And I don't get much so there's nothing much to lose
I just need a break, a little one
To get me up to watch the sun
And hey it's peaceful here, I like it
Hope it changes, hope my life changes
Gets alright somehow
Oh, I'm waiting for tomorrow
I hope it changes, can't just stay the same
Been out of luck for so long
Don't get much so there's nothing much to lose
I'm not 'bout to run away
Something always changes
I'm prepared to stay that way
Oh, I'm waiting for tomorrow
I hope it changes, can't just stay the same
Been out of luck for so long
Don't get much so there's nothing much to lose
I'm not 'bout to run away
Something always changes
I'm prepared to stay that way
I'm not 'bout to run away
Something always changes
I'm prepared to stay that way
Don't get much so there's nothing much to lose
I'm not 'bout to run away
Something always changes
I'm prepared to stay that way
Oh, I'm waiting for tomorrow
I hope it changes, can't just stay the same
Been out of luck for so long
