Standing here in front of you this perfect day
It's hard to imagine where tomorrow will lead
I'll keep this moment in my heart for eternity
Even through the rain I kept my faith
The will to follow through
And I never lose my way again
And it's all because of you
I'm flying high like the wind
Reaching the impossible, I'll never doubt again
I'm flying high 'cause your love's made me see
(Flying so high)
That anything is possible
Possible 'cause you believe in me
(Anything is possible)
In a world full of strangers, you were my saving grace
(Your love, your love, your love)
You showed me I was not alone
Alone in this place, no
I never believed it that a dream could come true but
If anyone has changed my mind, baby it's you
Even through the rain I kept my faith
The will to follow through
And I never lose my way again
And it's all because of you
I'm flying high like the wind
(Flying high)
Reaching the impossible, I'll never doubt again
(Reaching the impossible)
I'm flying high 'cause your love's made me see
(Flying so high)
(Your love's made me see)
That anything is possible
Possible is you believe in me
It's possible to spread my wings
And reach into the sky
(Into the sky)
Believe that I can fly away
When you're by my side
(I can do anything with you)
(I can do anything)
I'm flying high like the wind, yeah yeah
(I'm flying high)
Reaching the impossible, I'll never doubt it again
(Reaching the impossible)
I'm flying high 'cause your love's made me see
(Possible)
(Your love's made me see)
That anything is possible
Possible when you believe in
Anything is possible
Possible when you believe in me
