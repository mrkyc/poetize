And I don't feel it in your ways
You're smiling all the time, are you smiling in your eyes?
All I see is just a face fade away
I have an experience to know what's good for me
And I don't feel it in your ways
You know I've heard it enough times
To know when I'm being lied to
So move away, I'm wanting better things
Can't you see you throw away your life
(Throw away your life, no, owe to yourself, yeah)
It's more than I can't stand to hear your lies
You don't know what you think that you know
What you know isn't good enough
Keep on falling, you move out of sight
It's alright, I'll just walk on by
Do you see the heart of it, now that I set you free?
I only do it cause I can
You're certainly mistaken if you're thinking that I'm making
Simple little stories just to share
Can't you see you throw away your life
(Can't you see you throw away, owe to yourself, yeah)
It's more than I can't stand to hear your lies
You don't know what you think that you know
What you know isn't good enough
Keep on falling, you move out of sight
It's alright I'll just walk on by
But if you're looking for the good, take a look at yourself
'Cause yourself gonna make a change
You don't know what you think that you know
What you know ain't a good thing, yeah
It ain't easy, took a little while for me
Hurting feelings had to mend
Know I felt it enough times to know when I'm being lied to
So move away I'm wanting better things
You don't know what you think that you know
What you know isn't good enough
Keep on falling, you move out of sight
It's alright, I'll just walk on by
But if you're looking for the good, take a look at yourself
'Cause yourself gonna make a change, yeah, yeah
You don't know what you think that you know
What you know ain't a good thing
Throw away, throw away
Throw away your life
Keep looking for the good things
Looking for the good things
