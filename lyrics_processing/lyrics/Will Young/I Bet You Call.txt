Don't have to say nothing I already knew
Why else would you need drink on a Wednesday afternoon?
Hate to say I saw the warning signals from the start
Each round he'd be the first to reach the bottom of the glass

Just wait a peek, he really ripped you open
You're not a different person, you'll meet somebody else but

I bet you call
I bet you can't help yourself
I'm putting all my money on
You think you're free
I think you're still locked up
I bet you call
I bet you don't help yourself
I know you're drunk on wasted love
Hit on a boy and still you get chocked up
Sure it hurts
You just broke up
You've gotta hope it's not hopeless

He stands on tables for the whole damn room to watch
You hide behind the layer while he just takes them off
That's why you wanted him, that's why I'm not surprised
That's why my money's on going back a hundred times
