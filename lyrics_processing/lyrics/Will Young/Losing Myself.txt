There's something that's on my mind, mind
If you knew what I knew then you'd want to go
I'm looking for a way out
(I keep losing my)
I really don't know how, please
Won't you tell me now
Why I'm losing myself again
(Keep losing my)
I seem to go nowhere
Please won't you tell me, yeah
Why I'm losing myself again
(Keep losing my)
Keep walking to my own beat
It's hard to be out of the scene
Don't you know all these people
They stick to themselves
And no one's allowed to evolve
(I keep losing my)
I really don't know how, please
Won't you tell me now
Why I'm losing myself again
(Keep losing my)
I seem to go nowhere
Please won't you tell me, yeah
Why I'm losing myself again
(Keep losing my)
You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
And I'm losing myself again
Keep losing my, keep losing my
Keep losing my
(I keep on falling out)
Keep losing my, keep losing my
Keep losing my
(I keep on falling out)
You knew what I had to lose
(Keep losing my, keep losing my, keep losing my)
I keep on falling out
You knew what I had to lose
(Keep losing my, keep losing my, keep losing my)
I keep on falling out
I really don't know how
Please won't you tell me now
Why I'm losing myself again
I seem to go nowhere
Please won't you tell me, yeah
Why I'm losing myself again
(I keep losing my)
Why I'm losing myself again
(Keep losing my)
Why I'm losing myself again
(Keep losing my)
Why I'm losing myself again
(Keep losing my)
Why I'm losing myself again
(Keep losing my)
You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
You knew what I had to lose
