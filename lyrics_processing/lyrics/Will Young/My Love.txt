Lovin'
I'm gonna keep it coming
Why can't you feel my love?
I'm trying so hard
Trust in me
I won't let you down
Just give me a chance
'Cause I've changed, I've become a better man

Woah, woah, woah, woah

Give me one more chance to make it right
All I'm asking for is time
One more chance to prove
My love, my love, my love, my love
You don't have to say I'm wrong
'Cause I've know it all along
One more chance to prove
My love, my love, my love, my love

Woah, woah
My love, my love, my love, my love
Woah, woah
My love, my love, my love, my love

Let's leave tonight
