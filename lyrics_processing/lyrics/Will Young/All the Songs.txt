Walking along
Everything's good and I haven't felt this in so long
I get on the phone
My friends tell me they saw you dancing last night and I burn up
I might be alright
But I know you're dancing with somebody else to our song
Beginning to cry
That I'm not the one in your arms, just feels so wrong

Only takes a spark to light this flame
Lose my breath, my body starts to shake
Just don't know if there's more I can take
I'm close to breaking (Breaking)

Can't escape from these chains
All the songs remind me of you
All this pain, when will it end?
All the songs remind me of you
(Deep in my heart, deep in my heart)
All the songs remind me of you
(Deep in my heart, deep in my heart)
All the songs remind me of you

Every day (Every day)
It feels dangerous driving along with the radio on (With the radio on)
I'm living in fear (Living in fear)
All of my heart, all of my joy, wrapped up in these songs (Wrapped up in these songs)

Can't escape from these chains
All the songs remind me of you
All this pain, when will it end?
All the songs remind me of you
Remind me of you
Remind me of you
(Deep in my heart, deep in my heart)
All the songs remind me of you
(Deep in my heart, deep in my heart)
All the songs remind me of you

Everyday step I walk away
Leads me back to you (You)
All these songs playing in my mind
Leads me back to you (Back to you), woah

Only takes a spark to light this flame
Lose my breath, my body starts to shake
I just don't know if there's more I can take
I'm close to breaking (Breaking)
(Deep in my heart, deep in my heart)
All the songs remind me of you
(Deep in my heart, deep in my heart)
All the songs remind me of you
Only takes a spark to light this flame
Lose my breath, my body starts to shake
I just don't know if there's more I can take
I'm close to breaking
