Cut to the chase, your pretty face
Search outer space, leaving no trace
Making love in the heavens above
Flying so high, you and I
You and I, you and I

Can't get my head around you
Can't bear to be without you
Can't stop from thinking 'bout you
You turn my life around
Can't get my head around you
Can't bear to be without you
Can't stop from thinking 'bout you
You turn my life around

Time standing still, inch time to kill
Cheating the wheel, there are moments to steal
So another day gets brushed away
Preoccupied, you and I
You and I, you and I

Can't get my head around you
Can't bear to be without you
Can't stop from thinking 'bout you
You turn my life around
Can't get my head around you
Can't bear to be without you
Can't stop from thinking 'bout you
You turn my life around
