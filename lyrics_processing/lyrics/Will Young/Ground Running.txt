I've seen this place so many times
We're saving face to save a life
And I sink until I realise you're holding me up
We crawled across the broken floor
I'm ready now, so pull me out
I'm tossing and I'm turning, tell me, where are you now?

When I let go, my heart is open
I hear you call, hear you calling
When I got lost in a moment
I should have known that

It's just a moment tryna drag me down
Trouble gonna come my way
So keep going, we can hit the ground running
Now that we've started, only one way out
Looking at the finish line
So keep going, we can hit the ground running

Struggling to make it last
I made a change, no looking back
We were pulled out of the ocean but still swimming in doubt
Think about the better times
The summer days and rainy nights
You're the best I've ever had so tell me, where are we now?

When I let go, my heart is open
I hear you call, hear you calling
When I got lost in a moment
I should have known that

It's just a moment tryna drag me down
Trouble gonna come my way
So keep going, we can hit the ground running
Now that we've started, only one way out
Looking at the finish line
So keep going, we can hit the ground running

Tryna drag me down, trouble gonna come my way
We can hit the ground running
Only one way out, looking at the finish line
We can hit the ground running

But it's just a moment tryna drag me down
Trouble gonna come my way
So keep going, we can hit the ground running
Now that we've started, only one way out
Looking at the finish line
