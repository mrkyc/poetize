Wooo Oohh, (Get Em Girl)
Look At Here

I met this pretty girl
She was from D.C
I liked the way that she smile
Said, "There's a party tonight
You wanna come with me?"
She said, "Baby, I'll try."
I waited all night long
For her to walk in
For her to bring me her light
Then she came in the room
She looked right at me
She was the vision of my life

I love, my life
Everything is wonderful
My life
The sun is out, it's shining so bright
My life
Just like it's supposed to go
My life
And it's just getting started tonight
You and me, we're living the dream tonight, tonight
You and me, we're living the dream alright, alright
You and me, we're living the dream tonight, tonight
You and me, we're living the dream alright, alright
You might also like
I'm in the perfect place
Can't wipe the smile off my face
Ain't nothin' bringing me down
I feel like clappin' my hands
I feel like stompin' my feet
I feel like groovin' all night
With your body close to me
I hope you can feel my energy
Watch you move your body, get hot with me
You and I are celebrating tonight
It's all around me now
You couldn't stop it if you tried
Today is like no other day
Cause I'm havin' the time of my life

I love, my life
Everything is wonderful
My life
The sun is out, it's shining so bright
My life
Just like it's supposed to go
My life
And it's just getting started tonight
You and me, we're living the dream tonight, tonight
You and me, we're living the dream alright, alright
You and me, we're living the dream tonight, tonight
You and me, we're living the dream alright, alright
Take me to the sky
Like never before, like never before
And we'll lie back on the moon
Like never before, like never before
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

I love, my life
Everything is wonderful
My life
The sun is out, it's shining so bright
My life
Just like it's supposed to go
My life
And it's just getting started tonight
You and me, we're living the dream tonight, tonight
You and me, we're living the dream alright, alright
You and me, we're living the dream tonight, tonight
You and me, we're living the dream alright, alright

Tonight, tonight
