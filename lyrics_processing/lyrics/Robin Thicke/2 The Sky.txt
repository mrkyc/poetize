It's amazing the way the darkness falls
And the truth out there is cold
And nothing to keep you warm
Jealousy and lies within me
I got a feeling the sun won't shine today, oh
And I gotta know right now
Will I be rich, have everything I want
I stop myself and look to the sky

Oh, I gotta give myself up to the sky
The only truth is in the sky

Nobody else can tell 'cause I'm stuck in a spell
Of greed and anger and hate
Ooh, I tried, I tried, I tried to rise above it
But it comes right back
Creeps up on me and it hits me double time

This can't be my fate
It's never too late
I wake up holding on to this pain
And there's nothing else I can do
But to give myself up to the sky
Take me, take me to the, to the sky
Take me, take me, take me to the sky
Oh, it's so wrong out here, I need the sky
So cold out here, could it send me in to fly
Oh, I gotta give myself to the sky
Ooh, baby, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me, let me, let me take you, take you to the sky
To the sky, ooh, to the sky
Honey, let me hold you, keep you, take you to the sky
(Oh, oh) When you ask yourself
(Oh, oh) "Hey, why me?"
And "why not me" when you're down on your knees
Hey, look to the sky, woo (Oh, oh)
Just look to the sky (Oh, oh)
You don't need no faster car
Or no bigger house
All you really need is friends and love (To the sky)
Hey, come on home (To the sky)
Woo, throw up your hands
Just throw up your heart
All you really need is love, woo-ooh
