If I wasn't who I was, if I wasn't me
Would you stand next to me in the street?
If I changed my hair, would you then me proud?
If I ran around town with a different crowd
Would you be my baby, oh
If I had more money, oh?

Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh

If I practiced a different religion
If I spoke my words differently
If I changed my tune to your favorite song
Would you wrap your arms around me?
If I dug down deep to the bottom
Could you love me unconditionally?
If I sound like you and we laugh the same
Would you mind if I hang around?

Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh

I can't, I can't (Ooh)
I can't, I can't (Love)
I can't, I can't (Me)
I can't make you (Love)
I can't make you (Who)
I can't make you (Who)
I can't make you (Love)

If I came to you from a different place
Would my message finally be heard?
If it's just me and you and there's no one else
Would you see how much we're the same?
Could you be my lover? Oh
If I were a different color, oh
Could you be my brother? Oh

Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
Would that make you love me? Oh
