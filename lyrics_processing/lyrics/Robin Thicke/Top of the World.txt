You know how it goes

Come on, come on
Now you feelin' like a pimp, you got everything you want no wonder
Come on, come on
'Cause you never gave up, now you're singing that song all summer

I'm on top of the world, on top of it (Top of the world)
I'm on top of the world, on top of it (Top of the world)
I'm on top of the world, on top of it (On top of the world)
I'm on top of the world, top of the world

She was a little girl, picked on in school
Yeah, she had funny teeth, all the kids called her tooth-head
Years later when her mom got sick
She did everything she could, but mama wasn't rich
She didn't stop, worked ten different jobs, yeah
That put it her through community college
Waitress, retail, hot dog on a stick
Telling herself that it won't end like this
Now she the boss, she the boss, she the boss
You see it round her neck, yeah, you know what it cost
Now she the one with the smile on her face
'Cause no one gave it to her, yeah, she earned that feeling

And now she want to find love if she can
Somebody who can hold umbrellas in the rain
But she's a little hardcore with the pros
Could be goodbye, goodbye
'Fore it's hello, hello
Before you say a word you better have it read
Standing on a mine
You could end up, ooh
I'm a sometimes
But she's a lifestyle
I got a big hammer, but baby's a hard rock
Come on, come on
Now you feelin' like a pimp
You got everything you want, no wonder
Come on, come on
'Cause you never gave up
Now you're singing that song all summer

Where you at? On top of it
Where you at? On top of it
Where you at? She's on top of it (Yeah)
Where you at? On top of it
Yeah
Sometimes that's just how it goes

Now she well paid, first class, top grade
Go to sleep by herself only with the front page
Dreamin' of the one thing she ain't got yet
That's somebody to hold when the sun sets
She starts takin' them pills just to feel good
It's hard enough to be what she once was, keep it real
But she remembers how tough it was to get here
She can't be so hard on herself, yeah
You need a good time, baby girl, let it go (Let it go)
You need a good time, baby girl, let it go (Let it go)
You're still so young, good times, let it go (Let it go)
You're still so young, good times, let it go
Come on, come on

You got everything you want, no wonder
