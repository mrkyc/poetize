Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached
Can't stop their feenin' for long, no (ohh, no)
You makin' dogs wanna beg
Breakin' them off your fancy legs
But they make you feel right at home now

See, all these illusions just take us too long
And I want you bad
Because you walk pretty
Because you talk pretty
Because you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', 'til you're leavin'
Oh, I swear there's something when she's pumpin'
Askin' for a raise
Well, does she want me to carry her home now?
So, does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job, on my loot, my shoes, my shirt
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know, baby
When I get you alone
When I get you alone now
(It's all mine)
You might also likeCome on (oh yeah, yeah)

Baby girl, you the shit
That makes you my equivalent
Well, you can keep your toys in the drawer tonight (alright)
All my dawgs talkin' fast
"Ain't you got some photographs?"
Cause you shook that room like a star, now (Yes, you did, oh)

All these intrusions just take us too long
And I want you so bad
Because you walk city
Because you talk city
Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', 'til you're leavin'
So I pray to something she ain't bluffin'
Rubbin' up on me now
Well, does she want me to make a vow? (Check it)
Well, does she want me to make it now?
On my house, on my job, on my loot, shoes, my voice
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know, baby
When I get you alone
When I get you alone now
(It's all mine)
Oh no, get you alone baby
Oh oh oh oh, thatta girl! You get some

All these intrusions just take us too long
And I want you so bad
Because you walk pretty
Because you talk pretty
Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', 'til you're leavin'
But I pray to something when she's pumpin'
Rubbin' up on me now
Want me to break it down? (Check it)
Well, did you want me to make it now?
On my house, on my job, on my loot, shoes, my voice
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know, girl
When I get you alone
When I get you alone now
(It's all mine)
I get you alone
When I get you alone
I get you alone
When I get you alone
(It's all mine)
