I wish I could change, I wish I could change
I wish I could stop saying the same old things
I wish I could be who you want me to be
I wish I could stop being the same old me

I wish I could lose all of my blues
I wish I could stop putting my blues on you
I wish I could love like nobody loves
I wish that my goods outweighed my bads enough

There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too comp-
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too

I wish I could change, I wish I could change
I wish I could stop placing the blame, whoa
I can't stop it, I can't break down
I can't drop it, can't see how
You might also like
I wish I could lose all of my blues
I wish I could stop putting my blues on you
I wish I could love
I wish that my goods outweighed my bads enough

There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too comp-
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too complicated

You know it's killing me
Baby, how can I let you go
Suddenly, there's nothing I need more
There's no way, there's no way
There's no way, there's no way
I can't stop it, I can't break down
I can't drop it, can't see how

There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too comp-
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too comp-
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too comp-
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl, cause I'm too complicated
She's not complicated
But I'm too complicated
There's no way, there's no way
There's no way, there's no way
There's no way, there's no way
