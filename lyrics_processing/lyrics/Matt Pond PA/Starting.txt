Let the pictures down, they hold no life
And if you've got some faith then you are faithful
You fall down on your face, you got a face full
Oh, we could start tonight, pull down the plastic
Light the gasoline, we'll race the lines
And if you want to live then go on living
If you want to give, you've got to get it right
A ceiling was beyond the world I could afford
You'll never knock your head or chip your teeth
If you wanted some more
Or just keep dancing with your chin and vacant stare
The boundless worth in every movement
With you seated in your chair
And here we are, saints and sightseers
A light bulb phosphorescent flash and then we're gone
And there we were, all full of fevers
A millions shakes until the leaves have drifted on
And here we are, far beyond reason
A million fires, a million holes cut in the sky
And there we were, saints and sightseers
One million runway lights to bring us through the night

I tried to move a little closer, nothing left for me to lose
There is no argument to get me going hoarse
Misplaced my mind and now I do not have to worry 'bout before
Less talk, more arms, more legs, more swinging back and forth
Lights on, lights off, I know that I want to be adored
First hips then knees then feet, don't think anymore
Make no mistake, there's no blood when the words are gone
Less talk, more arms, more legs, more swinging back and forth
Lights on, lights off, we know we want to be adored
First hips then knees then feet, don't think anymore
