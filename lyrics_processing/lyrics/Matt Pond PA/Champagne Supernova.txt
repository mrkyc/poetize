Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams, she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
'Cause people believe that they're gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning around, we don't know why
Why, why, why?
