I was out the other day
And I saw you in your big black car
And I was waving as you were passing
'Cause I know who you are
You had this look that of an angel
It was such a bad disguise
And did you think for a second I would not realize?

Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
Ooh, ooh, oh-no

I was out the other night
And I saw you, so we had a fight
And it was late and I was lonely
And it was such a long way home
So I asked you if you'd join me
For a single last-call drink
So you turned and bought us two
And you didn't even blink

You had this look that of an angel
It was such a bad disguise
When you drink it makes you angry
When I drink I want you more and more and more
You might also like
Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this

(Somewhere in the middle)
You know I find it hard
I always try to find the sane life
(Somewhere in the middle)
I don't like the way things are
I keep falling to my knees
Somewhere in the middle of this
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this

Tripping hard, falling down onto the ground
'Cause I can't stand up and I can't fall down
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
Ooh, ooh, oh-no
'Cause I'm somewhere in the middle of this
