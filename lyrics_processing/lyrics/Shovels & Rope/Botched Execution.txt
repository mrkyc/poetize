They botched my execution back in 1996
I climbed out of a window and I hopped over the fence
Had to dig myself a tunnel, put my feet on the cement
And started running, running, running, ain't nobody seen me since
And now I've got to find a friend, someone to tell I didn't do it
But now my picture's in the paper, there's no way that I can prove it
And the body's in the closet 'cause I never got to move it
Now the neighbor kids are talking, saying, "Everybody knew it"

Ah ah
All my little seeds have grown
Ah
Ah ah
Sooner later come back home
Ah ah ah
Oh

Leave a trail of crumbs, a lure for them to bite on
In a Motel 6, thank God nobody left the light on
Dressed myself in women's clothing and a wig that I had tried on
Tried to cleanse myself of all those alibis I had relied on
See Shovels & Rope LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also likeAnd now I'm lying on my back, looking at the ceiling
When suddenly I am distracted by that old familiar feeling
With the table and the devil and the cards that he was dealing
I was sure enough a slave and some poor soul I would be stealing tonight


Well, hitched my skirt, climbed up the car on the railroad
Found myself a-gazing down the barrel at a crossroad
Hide out in the circus, rob a bank, hit the payload
Or wait out in the darkness with the freaks and kinda lay low
A storm had downed a power line, laying on the trainway
Standing in a puddle, felt a shock and in a ditch lay
In my final moments I could hear the lucky judge say
"Well, I guess the execution went as scheduled anyway"
