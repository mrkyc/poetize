Bleedin' out in a boxcar, shot in the back
We were all out of luck, all out of time
Law was waiting for us at the end of the line
Any minute now we knew we was gonna have to decide...
Take a fat chance and come out gunning?
Or get out now and try to keep running down south?
Refrain:
Then she said, "Hey hey cut the rope, there's no way I'm gonna let em get us both
So don't stop running till you reach that coast, let your pretty mama go up in smoke."
Coming out of the harbor was simple and new
Clean as clear water you could see straight through
But in that old dustbowl when the money got low
It was all we could do to keep a nail in the floor
It showed on her face, you could tell by the lines -these desperate times
Pistol strapped and her hair was dyed, gonna make her money like Bonnie and Clyde
We'll be alright
Refrain:
Until she said, "Hey hey cut the rope, there's no way I'm gonna let em get us both
So don't stop running till you reach that coast, let your pretty mama go up in smoke."
Don't let the sorrow of it get you down, change your last name and try your luck around
And if they ever come to ask about me, tell em that you knew me and you kinda liked me
I ain't afraid to go it on my own, you can make a run and make it all alone
You'll be alright

Till time ran out

She said, "Hey hey cut the rope, there's no way I'm gonna let em get us both
