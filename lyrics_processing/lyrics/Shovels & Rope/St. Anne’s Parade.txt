By the looks of everyone, it's been a long two weeks
Coming up on the business end of a good luck streak
Gave 'em hell in New York City, headed down to New Orleans
And drove across Mississippi in the rain
It don't seem to freeze to much down in New Orleans
But the rain can sure wash out the street
We crossed the snow line, man it was just in time
They're digging 'em out everywhere north of the Chesapeake

And I'm up too damn early in the morning
Watching the world around me come alive
And I need more fingers to count the ones I love
This life may be too good to survive

They cancelled a parade or two for weather
The kings and saints, their robes all soaking wet
But we were happy just to all be there together
Stoned on the porch, smoking all Niki's cigarettes
We been riding down this highway, now, for all these years
Breathing in the dust along the way
But it's the kindness of a friend is what's remembered in the end
It is a debt that is a pleasure to repay

And it never feels like we're getting any older
But the memories build up around the eyes
And I need more fingers than I got on my two hands
This life may be too good to survive

We were dressed to celebrate your wedding day
We marched along with the Saint Anne's parade
Sang out our hearts while they sent away their dead
The sun shone on the river, we begin our lives instead

And I'm up too damn early in the morning
I can't remember ever feeling so alive
And I need more fingers to count the ones I love
This life may be too good to survive
