I hadn't seen the place since '68
When we all got high and we rolled that tape
We were holed up waiting for a call from the man
Who had crashed his bike and gave birth to the band
I frowned and bend in my special way
Told my daddy I was gonna teach them boys to play
'Cause sometimes you know what you know
Well, you're never gonna learn if you can't let go

I am the last hawk
Flying over Woodstock
This is my last stop
'Fore I'm on my way

They say if you've never been to Saugerties
Then you've never heard the wind whisper through the trees
Never known work 'til you've worked holes in your knees
And I betcha you've never heard any songs like these
They dragged our name through the mud out there
It didn't feel right, and it didn't feel fair
'Cause that loud rock and roll was too much to bear
For the soft-hearted poets down in Harvard Square

Went floating down a river to a rig somewhere
'Cause sometimes you know what you know
Well, you're never gonna learn if you can't let go

I am the last hawk
Flying over Woodstock
I can see the tree tops
Praying for the rain
This is my last stop
I'm gonna take a long walk
'Fore I take my boots off
I'll see you 'round the way

This may be the last I see
Of that rotten old house down in Saugerties
And I was here and I made a mighty stand
But I may never stand right there again
Play a sweet song on these old keys
And I hope y'all might remember me
'Cause all that time is here and gone
Won't be no one left to carry it on
From my piano bench I saw it all
From the great ascension to the mighty fall
How could anyone know what we sang that day
Would tear your heart apart this way
All my brothers, they have flown away
But I've still got something left that I want to say
It's that sometimes you know what you know
And you'll never be free if you can't let go

I am the last hawk
Flying over Woodstock
I can see the tree tops
Praying for the rain
This is my last stop
I'm going to take a long walk
'Fore I take my boots off
