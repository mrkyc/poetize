Left her mama cryin' with her head in her hands
Such a sad case, so broken hearted
She say, Mama, I got to go, gotta get outta here
I gotta get out of town, I'm tired of hangin' around
I gotta roll on between the ditches
It's just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go
'Round and around nobody knows but the highway
Goes on forever, that ol' highway rolls on forever
Lord, she never would've done it if she hadn't got drunk
If she hadn't started runnin' with a travelin' man
If she hadn't started takin' those crazy chances
She say, daughter, let me tell you 'bout the travelin' kind
Everywhere he's goin' such a very short time
He'll be long gone before you know it
He'll be long gone before you know it
She say, never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leavin' Louisiana in the broad daylight
Down in the swampland, anything goes
It's alligator bait and the bars don't close
It's the real thing down in Louisiana
Did you ever see a Cajun when he really got mad ?
When he really got trouble like a daughter gone bad ?
It gets real hot down in Louisiana
The stranger better move it or he's gonna get killed
He's gonna have to get it or a shotgun will
It ain't no time for lengthy speeches
There ain't no time for lengthy speeches
