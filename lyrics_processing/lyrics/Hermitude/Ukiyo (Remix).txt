Yup, yup
Hermitude in this motherfucka
And we talkin' 'bout love
(Right, right)
Talkin' 'bout drugs

Runnin' laps on that ass, how I made the track
Whole culdesac, hear the trimmers of the aftermath
After that, tryna' find another, but I couldn't match
Flowers sweet as nectar I want cavities forever
My love
You my daily 9-5, well let's make that 9-9, 'cause I put in overtime
My love
Let me prop you on my desk, let me catch your pink slip, 'cause yo' pussy too fine

I'm giving you all I got
It's harder to fight the feeling (It's too much)
Whisper my way inside
Deep in your soul you hear me

I wanna tell my friends 'bout you
But without standing relations
Sure to come some expectations
Just know I'll never ask you for a day off
Ever since your love became my day job
I'm hoping that it pay off
Hoping that it pay off

Cotton candy, sugar thighs
Taste as sweet as cherry pie
I don't need an alibi
Workin' for you every night
Cotton candy, sugar thighs
Creamy as vanilla skies
I don't need an alibi
Workin' for you every night

I'm giving you all I got
It's harder to fight the feeling
Whisper my way inside
Deep in your soul you hear me

Working and working, I'm stocking yo' shelves
I've been saving and slaving, yo' body's my wealth
Say it's just business, but can't mind my own
'Cause if both of us quit, tell me what we got left
Take you out to dinner, just ride with me
Put in overtime, that's fine to me
Lyin' in the house
You don't even have to turn around
Baby just grind with me
Cotton candy, sugar thighs
Taste as sweet as cherry pie
I don't need an alibi
Workin' for you every night
Cotton candy, sugar thighs
Creamy as vanilla skies
I don't need an alibi
