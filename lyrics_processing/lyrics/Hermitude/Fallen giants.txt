When there's no chance, no chance, at all
Time to take stock, try to take off
With the brakes on, take a weight off, what you made of
We can face off, place off, turn off whatever
The flame that stays hot burns on forever
I'm a blow fly, pariah to you *galuys* 
Fire in the lion's eye like a pirate alliance
And when they, knock it down see my smiling defiance
I do not wake up wondering about what the day is, a *die as* 
I'm a pliers hire, came to tighten the screws, they're frightfully loose
Like you can't decipher the truth
Treat pythons in a cobra suit and biting at you 
Sometimes the universe will throw 'em  guidance to you 
Sight in a view, situations change like every day
And to me it's even being here that demonstrates
I've got a story if you've got a little deeper darling
Deeper than the teeth are snarling, take it to the secret garden
But that's another time that only came about when I was undermined
Fair enough I took the shots, got in line
We don't all throw no number 9, but we overcome
It's sheer stats
Did you hear that?
Giants will fall; sworn enemies break bread and talk
What matters seem no chance at all
Giants will fall; sworn enemies break bread and talk
What matters seem no chance at all
Did you catch a bad one, what's the plan son?
We stand stunned, out manned, out gunned, held for ransom
We take steps, place bets, rate your chances
It doesn't really make sense to wait for answers
I've made mad advances inventing raps at will
Trends still come and go but the benefits of skill are now on show
Well known incidents and disses
Bad punch lines opportunities missed and unfulfilled wishes
Faint in the distance hope you, haters are listening
Coz my vox got even stronger with the potshots that missed me
And hotshots seem to topple off the top so quickly
Another face lost in the crowd like Eleanor Rigby
You can tell I dig bein' in the limelight
As much as a good rhyme fight
Times I should've held my tongue in fifty-fifty hindsight
Been some pretty nifty blindsides you got to admit
Like one song gets 'em wide eyed, the others not a hit
I'm not a bit, concerned about these learners with road rage
I'll continue to burn into old age
A dream team of peers, mates and collaborators
Some who smash cross faders are my favourite rhyme sayers
And some are makin' multi layered music under no illusion that the time that we're losin' will not come back
That's why I will not be slack, and if you copy cats just want to take one thing from this rap
Then did you hear that?!
Giants will fall; sworn enemies break bread and talk
What matters seem no chance at all
Giants will fall; sworn enemies break bread and talk
What matters seem no chance at all
Giants will fall, enemies tall
