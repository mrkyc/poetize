Do you feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it
Do you feel it in the air
Air, air
Air, air
Do you feel it, feel it
Do you feel it, feel it
I can feel it in the (air)

Hear my voice in my ride as I drive by
I draw in color like a tie dye
We both winning and kidding us, are they kidding
They had to sell their souls just get what they were missing, wah

Do you feel buzz or is it just me
Something in the air, just above me
Something like a dream state
You call it a clean break
Do you feel the buzz bae

Something like a dream state
I can't even see straight
Do you feel the buzz bae
Do you feel the buzz

I'm blowing Ls Just cuz I just want the paper
I write rhymes, in black in white keeping it in composition
To mention this pen dripping off of affliction
It's of a
