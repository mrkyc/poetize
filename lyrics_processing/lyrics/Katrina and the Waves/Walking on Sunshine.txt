Ow
Mmm, yeah

I used to think maybe you loved me
Now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day
When you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox
I've gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me
You're coming around

Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh
And don't it feel good?
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good?
Hey, yeah

I used to think maybe you loved me
Now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life
Just a-waitin' for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
Ah no, no, no
I said, baby, I just want you back
And I want you to stay
Oh, yeah, now
