Can't wait for this day to be done
Can't wait feel the end is closer
You can't keep me holding on
'Cause I'm drawn by feeling
The night is calling me
I'm ready to start living
Where music flows free
Take me or leave me
I am what I will be
Live young and so free
Make this reality
Break through and feel it
Just like that first kiss
And now you won't miss
Life is bliss, could bliss be this? Yeaaaah
Midnight, the real me
I'm shining, oh, can't you see?
Midnight, I'm letting myself go
I'm lost in the rhythm
The night takes control
Can't get up, I must come down
Can't get the bells to stop ringing
Can't eject and leave now
9 to 5 has lost its meaning
Yeah, I'm sure you know this feeling
You know what's on my mind
'Cause when the night comes I'm leaving
Leaving it all behind

I am what I will be

I'm shining, oh, can't you see?
Midnight, I'm letting myself go
I'm lost in the rhythm

I am what I will be
Living so young and so free
Make this all reality
Break through and feel it
Just like that first kiss
And now you won't miss
Life is bliss, could bliss be this, yeaaaah
Midnight, the real me (Oh, the night, yeah)
I'm shining, oh can't you see (It's coming to take me away, yeah)
Midnight, I'm letting myself go (I can't sleep when the night is calling me)
I'm lost in the rhythm (Don't take me, I want to stay, yeah)
The night takes control
Midnight, the real me
I'm shining, oh can't you see
Midnight, I'm letting myself go
I'm lost in the rhythm
The night takes control
