Love is a kiss, love is a risk
Love might be our redemption, woah
Love is on time, love is not blind
Love might be our addiction, woah

Let's make some noise
Give it away
You call me craze
That's why you stay, oh

Takes love to know love, doesn't it?
Maybe we should love for the fun of it
Ooh baby, for the fun of it
La-la-la-la-la-love you all day like
Takes love to know love, doesn't it?
Maybe we should love for the fun of it
Ooh baby, for the fun of it
La-la-la-la-la-love you all day

Wild love
Ooh, will you give me wild love?
Ooh, I got your wild love
I really wanna la-la-la-love you all day
