Sunset, summertime season
Drinkin', don't need a reason
It ain't even hit yet
It ain't even hit yet
It ain't even hit yet

Straight drippin', chain ciggin'
We ain't trippin' 'cause you know we stay sippin'
Missbehavin', legs shaven
I don't really need a man, I'm just sayin'

It's my baby daddy's weekend (Yo)
I ain't leavin' (Oh)
Is we drunk yet? (No)
It ain't even

Sunset, summertime season
Drinkin', don't need a reason
My songs on the radio, turn it up, raise a cup
You think you feel it, but not yet
My swag, you think it's stolen
Why you mad? I wrote it
My songs on the radio, turn it up, raise a cup
You think you feel it, but it ain't even hit yet

All nightin', white lightin'
Body so thick, got the boys high fivin'
Country dream girl, have you seen her?
Number one baddie and I'm always gonna be her

It's my baby daddy's weekend (Yo)
I ain't leavin' (Oh)
Is we drunk yet? (No)
It ain't even
