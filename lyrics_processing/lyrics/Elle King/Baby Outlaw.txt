I been runnin' since the day I was born
I'm the definition of worn
Shed a tear for each soul set free
But that's what happens when you dance with me
Pity the man that stands in my way
I'm a nightmare, even in the day
I'd be wise with which words you say
'Cause they could be the last breath you take
Go ahead, baby, tell me

Well, I ain't nobody's baby
Baby, I'm an outlaw
Call me a criminal, maybe
Baby, I'm an outlaw
You know I ain't evil, but I ain't a saint
Can't help it, I was born this way
Yeah, baby, outlaw
Oh, baby, I'm an outlaw

I was cornered in the desert by a man
He took the pistol right from my hand
As he put it to my temple, I asked
"Do you think it's gonna be that simple?"
You see, I got a bullet for a tooth and
I'm gonna use it to shoot you
Even though you got a gun to my head
You'll be the one that ends up dead
Go ahead, baby, tell me

Baby, I'm an outlaw
You know I ain't evil, but I ain't a saint

Yeah, baby, outlaw
Oh, baby, I'm an outlaw

And I looked him right between his eyes
He was terrified
I thought I told you not to babydoll me

Well, I ain't nobody's baby
Baby, I'm an outlaw

Baby, I'm an outlaw
You know I ain't evil, but I ain't a saint
