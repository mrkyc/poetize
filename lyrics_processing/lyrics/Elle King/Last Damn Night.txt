I got one hand on the bottle
And one foot in the grave
It's been too long since I've slept
But I, I, I ain't got time to waste
Three long days, boy, you better pray
'Cause when that light shines on you
Gonna wanna stay forever and a day
But it's the night that I belong to

Well, the clock keeps ticking
And your time is running out
Well, the clock is ticking
And your time is running, running, running, running

So I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night
'Cause when the clock strikes twelve
We're all gonna go to hell
Said I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night
I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night

Well, I'm five seconds closer
To living six feet deep
There's seven steps to Heaven
But that stairway's just too steep
Oh, my, my, everybody dies
But you know that I don't want to
You get eight long lives, boy, you gonna cry
When the ninth one creeps up on you

Well, the clock keeps ticking
And your time is running out
Well, the clock keeps ticking
And your time is running, running, running, running

So I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night
'Cause when the clock strikes twelve
We're all gonna go to hell
Said I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night
I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night
Well, the clock keeps ticking
Don't pretend that you're ready to go
Well, it's ticking down, and slowly
And no eleventh hour is gonna hold me
'Cause I'm running, running, running, running

So I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night
'Cause when the clock strikes twelve
We're all gonna go to hell
So I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night
'Cause when the clock strikes twelve
We're all gonna go to hell
Said I'm gonna live my life
Like it's my last damn night
I'm gonna live my life
