I don't need nobody
I don't need no one
But I still got a little bit of lovin' left in me
Sure I'd like a little bit of lovin' in my life
But I ain't lookin' for no extra crazy

Well, my love was pure, but I made an awful wife
'Cause my husband was dumb and I was just lazy
(She was lazy)

I don't need nobody
I don't need no one
But I still got a little bit of lovin' left in me
I don't need nobody
I don't need no one
But I still got a little bit of lovin' left in me

Well, I was just a young thing, barely seventeen
Learned even a good man gonna do you wrong
Consider it a lesson, you can take it from me
There's consequences if your conscience ain't clean
(Consequences)

I don't need nobody
I don't need no one
But I still got a little bit of lovin' left in me
I don't need nobody

When I say the word I
I mean everyone, because we are all one
We've all been beat up
I've been put down, but we've all been kicked around
I'm still standing
I'm doing pretty alright, for a girl
I wanted to give up, ooh, I wanted to give up so bad
But I still believe that there is beauty in this world
You see you can be living, but you're not really alive
You have to be awoken, you have to be revived
This whole time I've been asleep, but you see
You don't need your eyes open to see love
The problem wasn't out there, the problem was inside of me
But I am not broken
And I don't need the love of another person to feel complete
You can't be loved until you've seen love
And you can't see love until you've known love
And you can't know love until you love yourself
But I know (Got a little)
And I got that now (Got a little)
(Got a little lovin' left in me)
(Got a little, got a little)
I still got a little lovin' left in me, hey guys
Got a little, got a little
I still got a little lovin' left in me
Got a little, got a little
I still got a little lovin' left in me
Hey ladies, come on
Got a little, got a little
I still got a little lovin' left in me
Got a little, got a little
Got a little lovin' left in me
Come on, everybody!
Got a little, got a little
I still got a little lovin' left in me
(Got a little, got a little) Still got
(I still got a little) Lovin' left in me
I still got (Got a little, got a little)
Well I still got (I still got a little)
A little bit of lovin' left in me
I still got it, I still got it
I still got a little bit of lovin'
Left in me
(Got a little, got a little)
I still got a little, lovin' left in me, c'mon
Got a little, oh, I got a little
(I still got a little) Lovin' left in me
Take it down, I got a little (Got a little, got a little)
Bit of lovin' (I still got a little lovin' left in me)
Left (Got a little, got a little)
