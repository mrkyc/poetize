I've been a-dancing in a devil's dirt
I'm a whole lot of trouble in a itty-bitty skirt
Well, the best kind of loving is the one that hurts
You can get your kicks, but I'll get mine first
I can take you down when the damned get wild
There's a whole lot of sinning but they're greener for miles
Three hits on the 6, there's a number that you dial
You can be like me but I'm a real brat child

I do what the good girls don't
I do what the good girls don't
I do what the good girls should never ever, never ever do

Hey, hey, hey
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang
Crashing, burning all away
Hey, hey, hey
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang
Crashing, burning all away

Well, I walked in the light and I lived in the sun
Now I die for the night 'cause the days are done
I kissed a couple of angels but it wasn't much fun
So I shake, shake, shake it with an evil tongue

I do what the good girls don't

I do what the good girls should never ever, never ever do

Hey, hey, hey
Since I'm gonna go to hell anyway
I'll go out with a bang, bang, bang
Crashing, burning all away
