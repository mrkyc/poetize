Cast me down where the Devil don't go
Devil don't go where I'll make my home
Cast me down where the Devil don't go
Devil don't go where I'll make my home
Drown my woes in a lake of fire
Sinner's song gonna take me higher
Drown my woes in a lake of fire
Sinner's song gonna take me higher
Good Lord turned his back on me
Lucifer gonna set me free
Good Lord turned his back on me
Lucifer gonna set me free

It's a mean world that I've known
Never got no good doing what I'm told
It's a mean world that I've known
Now you'll find me where the Devil don't go
Where the Devil don't go

Preacher man won't cut no slack
Caught my demons but gave them back
Preacher man won't cut no slack
Caught my demons but gave them back
