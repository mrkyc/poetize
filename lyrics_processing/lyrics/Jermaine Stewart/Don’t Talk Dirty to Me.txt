I always seem to fall in love
With the wrong person
You whisper in my ear
All the things you thought I'd like to hear, yeah
Your approach was much too strong
Instead of love we're in the danger zone
Maybe there are better ways to get to
Know someone
And I've always been the type to never
Bite my tongue
So cool it out
I'm not gonna change my mind
I like you just the way you are, girl
You're the best
Do I have to shout?
I'm asking you, please
Don't talk dirty to me
Don't talk dirty
Don't talk
Don't talk
Don't talk dirty to me

I really don't think it's time
To try to seduce me with your lies
Why you wanna try something new
In my opinion, I just call it rude
If you take a moment just to notice
I'm into you
So those words can't make my feelings stronger
To tell the truth, yeah
Cool it out
You should try to show some class
Have some finesse, girl
It's not ladylike
Do I have to shout?
I'm asking you, please
Don't talk dirty, no, no

Yes, she was right
It's time to go home now
No, I think I wanna take a trip
Go back east
Minneapolis!
No, no, Chi-Town!
Mm-mm...
No, no, I think I wanna go to the Big Apple
New York!
No, no, I wanna be...
I wanna get some sunshine
L.A.!
Cool it out
You should try to show some class
Have some finesse, girl
You're the best
