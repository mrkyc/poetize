Girls like you come and go
Makes me wonder who you've been with before
You like to play with romance
Just like a roulette wheel to catch your man
I've got to know if it's me
Or is it just the way to your fantasy?
Real love, baby, that's right
You can't take my love then say goodnight, oh, no
Tired of being misled
Wanna settle down with a girl that's true
Please, won't you help me out?
Come on, tell the truth
Is it really love that you need?
Do you really want to be with me?
Is it just for my money or the image of my fame?
Is it really love?
You've got the look that men adore
You made me weak and now I want you more
I gotta know if you'll be around
Not only when I'm up but when I'm down, oh
You might also likeTired of being misled
Wanna settle down with a girl that's true
Please, won't you help me out?
Come on, tell the truth
Is it really love that you need?
Do you really want to be with me?
Is it just for my money or the image of my fame?
Is it really love?
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Tired of being misled
Please, won't you help me out?
Oh, is it really love that you need?
Do you really want to be with me?
Is it just for my money or the image of my fame?
Is it really love?
Hey, yeah!
Is it really love?
Is it really love?
Tell me, won't you sing it?
Hey, yeah!
