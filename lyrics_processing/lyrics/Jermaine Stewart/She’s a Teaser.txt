She knows how to cast a lie
She knows every trick in the book
She's got everything it takes
To get me every time
I know whenever she's around
She-she knows I get a little bit shaky
She can put together all her toys
And turn a wanting man into a willing boy
She tells me things I'm sure that I never heard
There's something 'bout her body
Puts it all into words
She's a teaser
She's never gonna please you
She's a teaser
You wish you didn't meet her
You just can't get that girl out of your mind
She goes out every night
To take clothes, she's got 'em waiting in line
She doesn't have to look me straight in the eye
To know what I've been thinking
She could read my mind
She'll let you think you got it under control
But once she's got her hooks in
It's so hard to let go
