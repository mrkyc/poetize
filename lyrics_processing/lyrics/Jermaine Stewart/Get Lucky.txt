I feel the winter's done
I see the brighter sun
Of the summer days
And in your face I feel
Someone who holds the key
To everything I need
To hope is my desire
Oh, baby...
And every word you say
I feel it coming through
With every move you make
My heart believes in you
There'll be no turning back
Can be no turning 'round
I'm gonna give it all
To this love I found
I'm gonna get lucky, mm-hmm
I'm gonna get lucky this time
I feel I'm gonna get lucky
Get lucky
I'm gonna get lucky
Real love is so hard to find
I feel at last this love is mine
I'm gonna get lucky, hey, hey
I'm gonna get lucky this time

Safe forevermore
Sometimes I've been so wrong
I've had to pay the price
The tears and loneliness
Of all the sacrifice
I'm gonna get lucky, so lucky
I'm gonna get lucky this time
I, I feel I'm gonna get lucky

You are the one for me
My heart believes it's true
Each time I ask myself
Oh, may I be wrong?
