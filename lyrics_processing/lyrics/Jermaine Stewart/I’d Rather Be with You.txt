We're gonna have fun doin' this one
Uh-huh
(You don't stop)
(Ah, yeah!)
C'mon! This is gonna be just fine
(You don't stop)
I could be a king who sit upon a throne
Ruling over my kingdom, yeah, c'mon
I could fly from Concord from New York to Rome
And hang in my museum
But I'd rather be with you
(You don't stop)
There's nothing in comparison
(Ah, yeah!)
Oh, baby, you're so cold
(Just too cold)
I'd rather be with you
(You don't stop)
The only word that fits you, baby
(The only word that fits)
Is wonderful, ooh!

I've got more than any man should have
It keeps my telephone ringing
(And your clothes?)
My clothes, the finest of the finest rack
But that don't stop me singing

(You don't stop)
You're mixing my vocabulary
Oh, baby, you're too tough
(Just too tough)
I'd rather be with you, ooh
(You don't stop)
In Mr. Webster's dictionary
It just don't say enough, mmm...
You see, now, I get everything I want
(Ah, yeah!)
I get to pick and choose, ooh
But lemme tell you where I'm coming from
Without you, there just ain't no use
Make my body say
Ooh, Chihuahua, sha-na-na, hey
(Ah, yeah!)
I'd rather be with you any old day, sing!
Ooh, Chihuahua, sha-na-na, hey
I'll give it all back in a minute
'Cause I'd rather be with you
(You don't stop)

Lemme bust this rhyme:
You see, I know I'm right when I say these things
'Cause I already got these diamond rings
And this fine wear and those Wi-Fi cars
But enough about me because I'm trying to get where you are
And that's where it's at because you're sitting on top
You're so fine as whack and I just can't stop trying
I'm not lying
You see I rather be with you, I'm just dying
(Yeah!)
You see, now, I get everything I want
(Ah, yeah!)
I get to pick and choose, uh-huh
(I get to pick and choose)
But lemme tell you where I'm coming from
Without you, there just ain't no use
Everybody sing
Ooh, Chihuahua, sha-na-na, hey
I'd rather be with you any old day, sing!
(Ah, yeah!)
Ooh, Chihuahua, sha-na-na, hey
I'll give it all back in a minute
'Cause I'd rather be with you, whoo!
(You don't stop)
There's nothing in comparison
Oh, baby, you're so cold
(Just too cold)
I'd rather be with you, ooh
(You don't stop)
The only word that fits you, baby
(The only word that fits)
Is wonderful, hey, hey
(I'd rather be with you)
Now, now, wait, wait, wait a minute, baby
Now, see, you don't understand the meaning of this song
You know, now, see, I have all this money
You know I got a lot of money
But I don't, uh, I don't need it if I can't have you
You know what I'm saying?
I like to take you shopping and--and just--
Uh, here, here, just take the American Express card
No, no, take the Gold card
Scott, scoot, scoot, scoot, go on
Go on out and do some shopping
I'll be here at home waiting on you
Get back with the pool waiting and the...
The Jacuzzi waiting all heated up, yeah!
While you're at it, um, what about some love

The wildest, wild thing ever, baby, yeah

Yeah, we gonna have a good time!
