All over town, everybody's talking
It ain't no secret anymore
You are the one they're saying
That has phony information

'Cause the word is out

It on, it on, it on, it on
There's nothing left to do but stop it
I won't repeat it, oh no, I won't
I can't stand the gossip out on the streets now
How could they see us behind closed doors?
Why did you have to tell them?
I told you not to say a word
Why did you have to say it
We were never seen (Never seen)
Now I can't believe the word is out
