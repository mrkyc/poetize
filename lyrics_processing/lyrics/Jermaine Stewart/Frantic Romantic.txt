I'm just a frantic romantic
I'm so in love with you
Sipping wine by candlelight
While I gaze into your eyes
I should treat like you were a queen
All the riches in the world
The biggest diamond or a pearl
You'll get nothing but the best from me
You just take away your awe
There's no need for you to change
You deserve the finest things for free
If you ever wonder why
That I treat you oh so nice
It's because I want you just for me
If I thought that I give you paradise
I wouldn't hesitate, no, no, no
I place in your hands with full demands today
Baby, baby, baby
Can't you see?
I'm just a frantic romantic
Follow me, it's my destiny
Can't you see?
I'm just a frantic romantic
So in love with you
