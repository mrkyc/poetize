Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me? Mmm-hmm
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We've been friends, real close friends, for a long time
I can tell there's something heavy hanging on your mind
Action speaks louder than words
I was sure you said it right when you said last night
"I love you"
Say it again, ooh, honey
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Say it again and again and again and again
Sitting here with your head in a crazy spin
Don't be afraid to let this love affair begin
Hold me, tell me what's on your mind
I'll always have the time to hear those words
"I love you"
Say it again, ooh, honey
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Say it again and again and again and again
