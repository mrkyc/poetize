Party nights, nowhere to go
Guess I'll hit the streets
Get into the floor
Call my posse
I'll meet you at 10:00
The front door of the club
Mediterranean
We reach the counters
She says, "$20, please"
Hmm, we looked up
Uh-oh, there was security
"What's the problem?"
He was lugging me
He says, "Man, you can't get in here
With those holes in your jeans!"

Bodies moving
Girlies shaking
Grooving to the beat
All-night passion
Every heart is breaking
Don't you try to keep me out
Everybody scream and shout
I'll show the world
I dress to receive
Hey, everybody
I got holes in my jeans
(Holes in my jeans, yeah)
It really doesn't matter
Ain't nothing I see (no)
Dance, everybody
With holes in your jeans
Holes in my jeans
C'mon!
C-c'mon!
C'mon!
The time is right
So come as you are
(Come as you are)
The joint is happening
It's not very far
So call a taxi
No, get out your wheels
Come join the party
Where you do what you feel
(Doing is what you feel)
Silking ladies
Neon babies
Everybody's slamming
Slamming to the beat
Corporate haunchos
Ooh, those lady machos
Don't you keep nobody out
Everybody scream and shout
I'll show the world
(I'll show the world)

Holes in my jeans
Say ho! Say hey!
Say ho-ho! Say hey!
(Yeah, boy!)
Say ho! Say hey!
(Let's do this!)
Say-say-say-say hey!
Holes in my jeans, that's my attitude
No offense, not trying to be rude
A free world, let my freedom swing
Chill out, relax, let me do my own thing
Holey jeans, it's a new crave
Taking over like a tidal wave
Stay your height, go funky fresh
Who in the hell are you trying to impress?
I'm living large, let me tell you why
I ain't afraid to show off a little thigh
Don't get alarmed, I'm gonna be seen
And when you see me coming
I have holes in my jeans
Silking ladies
Neon babies
Everybody's slamming
Slamming to the beat
Corporate honchos
Ooh, those lady machos
Don't you keep nobody out
Everybody scream and shout
I'll show the world
(Show the world)
I dress to receive
