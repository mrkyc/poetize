I wanna tell you what it takes to set you free
Give your body and your soul a second chance
Let yourself forget yourself and dance
Can't think of another word for it
It won't do any good to try
You can't say that you never heard of it
You've waited all your life
So start believing
What you're feeling
It's happening to you
Call it a miracle
Whoa-whoa-whoa
No, you're not dreaming
What you're seeing
It's happening to you
Call it a miracle
Whoa-whoa-whoa
You made your wishes, now you watched them all come true
You got a lover that would leave it up to you
Close your eyes, it isn't hard to understand
It's gonna happen for you sooner than you planned
