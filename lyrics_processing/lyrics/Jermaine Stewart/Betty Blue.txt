She taught me things no other woman could
Ow!
Yeah
(Oh-wee, oh-wee)
Listen
(Oh-wee, oh)
Betty was in education
You couldn't get in school
An older woman with a hunger
For breaking all the rules
And the tender heart of a young boy
She made a first mistake
While she had my cradle rocking
The bough began to break
You got to understand
You made this boy a man
And he just can't get over you
Betty Blue
I really need to know
Betty Blue
Where did my teacher go?
You might also likeBetty was a sensation
A dream that came to life
I guess she was my lover
But someone else's wife
Sneaking out through the back door
On another midnight run
I should've seen it coming
She was only having fun
The writing on the wall
I never saw it all
And I still can't get over you
Betty Blue
I really need you now
Betty Blue
No other girl knows how
To love me
That crazy way that you do
Can't you see
I need my Betty Blue, yeah
Is it wrong to go along
Wishing that soon you will
Come back to me?
Oh, overtime will change your mind
But just for now
I'll be drifting on your memory
Baby, sing
(Oh-wee, oh-wee)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
(Oh-wee, oh)
Hey
(Oh-wee, oh-wee)
Listen up
You got to understand
You made this boy a man
And I just cannot help myself, girl
Just like you did before
You left me wanting more
And I just can't get over you, Betty
Betty Blue
I really need you now
Betty Blue
No other girl knows how
To love me
That crazy way that you do
Can't you see
I need my Betty Blue
Yes, I do now, girl
Betty Blue
I really need you now
(Oh-wee, oh-wee)
Betty Blue
No other girl knows how
(Oh-wee, oh)
To love me
That funky way that you do
(Oh-wee, oh-wee)
Can't you see
I really, really need you, Betty Blue, yeah
Betty Blue
I really need you now
(Oh-wee, oh-wee)
Betty Blue
No other little girl knows how
(Oh-wee, oh)
To love me
That funky way that you do to me, yeah
(Oh-wee, oh-wee)
Can't you see
