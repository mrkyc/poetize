From where I want to be?
And how is it, it seems like everyday
It's lost so easily?
It's all I've got on my mind
And all I've got to find is the reason why
Choosing my future path (Oh, why?)
Oncoming storms to pass (Why?)
When choices self somehow
Seems so unreal right now
(I can't comprehend)
Is it right that I can't be wrong?
Still it keeps on and on
Will I ever learn the reasons why?
Here I sit, I'm wondering
Why I feel the way I do
And how is it as doubt sets in
I'm further from the truth?
Oh, it's with me all the time
But still I can't find the reason why
Time and again, I ask (Oh, why?)
If the future's just like the past (Why?)
I can't quite comprehend
I'm trying to understand
(I can't comprehend)
Is it right that I can't be wrong?
Still it keeps on and on
Will I ever learn the reasons why?
