You've descended on my lonely life
When your eyes met mine
I felt the heat running down my spine
Same place at the same time
We love until the dawn
I'm wanting you
While you're wanting me
Come on over to my house
I wanna take you to my house to love you
Come on over to my house
You and me we both know it's where we wanna go
Come on over to my house
Come on over to my house
Passion in the air
I feel it 'round me everywhere
You must've come from in my dreams
'Cause we fit each other to a tee, tee, tee, tee
Here you are right before my eyes
You're like a poet in motion
I don't know what we got
But it's one hell of a potion
(It's a hell of a potion)
