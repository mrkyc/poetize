Glad to know you're happy
That you finally found
Someone to be your plaything
Please don't ask me if
I like to reminisce
'Cause I just may start a fire
That was never lit, no
I'm glad my days
Changed through the years
My ma told me
Son, don't you forget
Don't have sex with your ex, no
Don't have sex, don't do it
Don't have sex with your ex
Don't have sex, don't do it
Oh, no, no, no
The lights are too dim
The wine is chilled, it's too perfect
What am I doing here?
Don't take my kindness for weakness, no, no
Why can't we end up
Just being friends
My love's outgrown you
I can't forget
