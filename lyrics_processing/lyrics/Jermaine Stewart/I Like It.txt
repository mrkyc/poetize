Everything you told me to, oh
I never loved no one quite as much
Only you have that magic touch
But seasons go, you don't believe me
When I tell you I'm under your spell
This is not a question
This is not a love song
This is not solitaire
You got me right where you want me
I'm not going anywhere
My heart is pounding, my pulse is jumping
(My pulse is jumping)
I'm getting dizzy and I like it, hey
Maybe I'm taking it too serious
At last I can speak my mind
Won't you follow your woman's intuiton
Don't leave me standing right behind you
It appears to be that you just trust me
I'm feeling like a puppet on a string
This is not a shakedown
This is not a notion
This is not my alibi
