Oh...

Well, I know you're tired of waiting
'Cause she keeps on hesitating
Right now she's just a little straight of shy
And so she's trying to hide it
But you got her so excited
Her eyes light up whenever you walk by
So show her that her love's worth waiting for
She'll give you all you want
And so much more, ooh-oh
Every woman wants to
Every woman wants to
Even though she maybe saying no, no, no
But every woman wants to
She may tease and taunt you
Every woman wants to fall in love, oh-oh
Yo, every woman wants to
Even if she tease and taunts you
Every woman wants to fall in love
Now every woman wants to
And remember never let it haunt you
'Cause every woman wants to fall love
