We turned it out, danced a bunch
We danced on the walls, we danced on the floor
When the lights came up, I couldn't take it no more
She took me round (and round)
And around (around)
And round and round and round (around)

My body, mmm, my body
Well, she wanted love so serious
I can see it all by the look in her eyes
She said, take my hand, I'l make you my man
When the lights came up, well, I'm sure you understand
She took me round (and round)
And around (around)
And round and round and round (around)
Oh, my body, mmm, my body
