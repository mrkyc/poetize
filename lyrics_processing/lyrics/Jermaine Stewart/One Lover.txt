Well, yeah
One lover, lover
I need one lover
Well, yeah
One lover, lover
I've had enough of overnight sensations
What I need is love that's gonna last
In and out, it happens much too fast
I need someone with a perfect body
But someone else has a perfect mind
Up and down the rollercoaster ride
When I open my heart
Every time love just tears it apart
And it seems that the same things
Keep happening to me, yeah
One lover, well, at a time
I need one lover, lover
To do me just fine, yeah
One lover at a time
I need one lover, lover
My, oh, my
Love can come, come in any colors
But only one is gonna figure right
Someone might just fit those shoes tonight, yeah
I've run away, run away from chances
I've been afraid, afraid from my mistakes
Why, oh, why does love still make me wait?
Oh, when I look to the stars
And I think that love comes from so far
Well, I hope that someday
It will travel to me, yeah
