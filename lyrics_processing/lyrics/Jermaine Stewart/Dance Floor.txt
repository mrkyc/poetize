I would take you where to go
If you're the type that moves too slow
Get on up and follow next to me
To the beat, anything you see
Upside-down or on your knees
The choice is yours, I'm versatile, baby
Choose the place, go anywhere
Lollipop or Fred Astaire
Give me room, I need some space to move
If you get a bit confused
And have nothing else to do
Jermaine will tell you what to do
Choose your own dance floor
D-d-dance, dance
Your own dance floor
D-d-dance, dance
You might also likeYeah, oh, yeah, uh-huh
If you find the perfect place
On the roof, the subway train
The choice is yours, create a holiday
DJs play something right
Scratch my feet and mix my mind
It's time to go all the way tonight
Hurry up, make up your mind
Party till the early light
Never stop or find someplace to be
Street corners has got the beat
With yellow patterns on every street
Don't breakdance if you feel it's not you

Another way to move your hips
Can't slow down, I got so far to go
No closet to be locked in
The word is out, go tell your friends
It's time for the celebration
