Record this one
Let me take you (Woo)

She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morn
And she said, "Daddy, let me take ya home, papi, let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami, you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on" (Bitch)

I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's wild and
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin' on Crenshaw and cruisin' for food when
She pulled up beside me sat off in a 'Lac
And I said "Damn, girl, you actin' like you don't know, never seen me before?
Episode of Cribs on MTV, video, what you think TS stand for?"
She said "Terrific Sex", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no facade
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich, got the world screamin' Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go, every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin' me (Let me take you)

She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morn
And she said, "Daddy, let me take ya home, papi, let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami, you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on" (Bitch)

I was up in the club, right? Had some Remy in my cup, right? And that's when I peeped him
He was lookin' so fresh and so cleaned up, from his fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this, I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin' in between us
Had to go over there so I could meet him, I had him, pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin'
If he crush me, then trust me, it's a guarantee that he's not leavin'
Told me that he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin'
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin' me (Let me take you)

She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morn
And she said, "Daddy, let me take ya home, papi, let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami, you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on" (Bitch)

You's a big girl, eat it up
Now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin' off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin' up, swervin' the bumps
I'm tryna fuck, but I ain't tryna fuck the 23s up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Tryna watch the road but, yo, the back seats heatin' up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin' like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated
Wish you was here but, gotta go now, have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just cold jumped over the front seat and
I think she's about to go down for sheez and
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
Three in the morning and actin' indecent
She so horny, damn, this shit seems like
Every other night I got a group of chicks beggin' me (Let me take you)
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morn
And she said, "Daddy, let me take ya home, papi, let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami, you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on" (Bitch)
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morn
And she said, "Daddy, let me take ya home, papi, let me take ya home"
