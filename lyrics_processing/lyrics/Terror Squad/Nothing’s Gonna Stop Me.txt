Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
Nothing's gonna stop me

Ayo I walk the walk, talk the talk
New York what's liver son, I'm Iverson
Killer cross, vanilla Porsche with diamerands
The mami man, vibin' and, sometimes I lie when I
Creep right behind ya, leave ya seeds right beside ya
Nigga

Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
Nothing's gonna stop me

Ten years in the same shit, nothing but a same hit
Revisit the catalog, been in it since analog
Damn it dawg I don't know which planet you landed on
Gotta understand the Don, I came from slangin grams of 'ron

Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
Nothing's gonna stop me

You could never ever, ever ever, ever ever get on my level
Smack the shit out the devil
It's the god crack fully armed strapped
Where the Bronx at, hope ya guns clap cuz
We ready for combat, nigga

Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
Nothing's gonna stop me

And that's my word to Pun, Reo, Sycho, Schmeo
Most legendary, most prolific MC's, it's hereditary
Terror Squad clique, and we all spit
Motherfuckers don't believe me then, watch the youngin shit
Cocksuckers

Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
Nothing's gonna stop me

T-O-N-Y Sunshine hought tought who gun shy
Huh! Goddamnit the flow sick and I'm so fly
Now who you know slang more dick in some cho-cha
Quite like I, nigga, tonight you might die nigga
Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
Nothing's gonna stop me

Okay, we started this, beef we slaughter kid
Please, you in a starter kit
Try to kick some harder shit
In fact switch to reggae tone
Spit on some retarded shit, this is gangsta music
Joey Crack bring in the chorus kid

Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
Nothing's gonna stop me


Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
Nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna stop, nothing's gonna stop
