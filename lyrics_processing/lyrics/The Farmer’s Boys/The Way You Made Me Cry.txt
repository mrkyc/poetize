And he tells me I'm my own worst enemy
Even so I'm still sat here on this barstool
With only a gin for company
I know it's wrong to look for answers in a glass
But the questions keep on coming and this cigarette's my last
I know some things you've done surprised me in the past
But there's still one thing I never thought you'd do
I'd like to think about the way we met that night
I'd like to think of all the warmth of holding tight
But all I think of is the way you made me cry
A thing I never thought you'd do
All that I think of is the way you said goodbye
And that's the last I've seen of you
I've spent many nights just trying to find a reason
And my friends say I'm a fool to myself
Even so another gin has just been ordered
And the barman seems concerned about my health
Last night I dreamt I smelt the perfume that you wear
When I woke up in the morning I still thought you might be there
And I turned over but it's only in despair
Cos there's still one thing I never thought you'd do
You might also likeI'd like to think about the way we met that night
I'd like to think of all the warmth of holding tight
But all I think of is the way you made me cry
A thing I never thought you'd do
All that I think of is the way you said goodbye
And that's the last I've seen of you
Last night I dreamt I smelt the perfume that you wear
When I woke up in the morning I still thought you might be there
And I reached over but it's only in despair
Cos there's still one thing I never thought you'd do
I'd like to think about the way we met that night
I'd like to think of all the warmth of holding tight
But all I think of is the way you made me cry
A thing I never thought you'd do
All that I think of is the way you said goodbye
