Here with all my friends
It's been a good time
Shame it has to end
We're really swinging
We're all in the mood
That's when it hits me
All of a sudden
I don't feel so clever
I don't think I'll ever
Learn to face up to myself
I've got this feeling
That my hair's receeding
Am I on the receiving end of some bizarre new game
And as my mind expands I say
Out again
I'm bailing out again
I've bottled out again
I'm thinning out again
Deciding to go
Well I guess this goes to show
That I never want to know
You might also likeAbout the high life
Just who went and came
And was that girl there?
You know what's-her-name
And did she kiss you?
Yes I felt the same
That's when it hits me
All of a sudden
I don't feel so clever
I don't think I'll ever
Learn to face up to myself
I've got this feeling
Was I too revealing
Am I on the ceiling
Can I face another night of this hell?
And now my mind expands again
So tell me why am I always the one
Who ends up being the figure of fun?
And tell me why am I so unaware
Each time my girlfriend's with someone upstairs
And now my mind expands again
Out again
I'm bailing out again
I've bottled out again
I'm thinning out again
Deciding to go
Well I guess this goes to show
That I never want to know
About the nightlife
Maybe it's my fault
When every time I
I get the same result
Just when I'm swinging
When I'm in the mood
That's when it hits me
All of a sudden
I don't feel so clever
I don't think I'll ever
Learn to face up to myself
I've got this feeling
That my hair's receeding
Am I on the receiving end of some bizarre new game?
All of a sudden
I don't feel so clever
I don't think I'll ever
Learn to face up to myself
I've got this feeling
Was I too revealing?
Am I on the ceiling?
Can I face another night?
All of a sudden
I don't feel so clever
I don't feel so groovy
I feel none too marvy
I feel a bit queasy
I don't feel so well
I don't feel too good
