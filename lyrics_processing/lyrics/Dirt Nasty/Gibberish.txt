Gibberish, g-g-gibberish
We talking all that stupid shit
Gibberish, g-g-gibberish
We be talking that stupid shit

I'm Andy, I like birds and candy
Legacy gonna murder your family
And you can ask James Gandolfini
Who the best mafia hitman Sopran-is

Let me tell you how we do this shit
Three Buddhists at a nudist beach
Listening to Judas Priest
We stuck your grandmaw and your Jewish neice

You ever put your cock in veal
It's kind of like playing the glockenspiel
The beat goes bingo-bongo
Chicken with broccoli
Chingo-chongo

You might also like
Have you ever sucked a falcon's dick
It's kind of like being John Malkovich
Lava flow on my Jewish tits
???

Smoking meth at the ?
My dog's retarded, he don't bark right
My blunt is sparked right
Surfed the internet and got a shark bite

People think I'm crazy
Andre Legacy, what's up baby
Never had to work at Old Navy
I sold drugs, I boned old ladies

Gibberish, it's gibberish
My favorite candy is licorice
Gibberish, it's gibberish
L-l--l-licorice


Crammed my cock in a camera box
Slam my dick in the Santa socks
Panoramic after thoughts
Peeling back my banana log

Who got the bitches?
I need crack, I came with Tom ?
And that little crazy midget
Mini Me, he got the biggest baby dick

Skin soft like a baby bottom
Finger wimpy and stink palm olive
Take a piss in the pee-pee room
I hope that you will see me soon

Put my boinker right in her oinker
Fat Indian bitch from ?
Now I'm gonna give you a few pointers
Don't eat her out if it smells like oyster

All we are is dust in the wind
Smoke dust then cash the chips in
Las Vegas to Michigan
Commissioner ?
Your titties smell like a Christmas tree
When it's nice out, I kiss the sky
I lost my dick in ?
You're Heathcliff and my name is Mongo
