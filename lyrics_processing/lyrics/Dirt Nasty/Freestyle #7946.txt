Yeah I said it before, I was born in Haiti
I got my dick sucked in Jamaica, you a faker
I'll take you out to dinner
Nah McDonalds, chicken fingers
You think it's a joke, bitch, you could get poked like facebook
I hate to look in your eyes, because they look like a guy
Your skin tone's pale, I look in the sky like Abagail
That's me, Dirt Nasty on the ice cold streets
I don't give a shit, all you haters out there, you could get my baby dick
It's just the beginning. Man my skin looks like it's an alien from Michigan
I'm straight Loco
Man I don't give a fuck about Yoko Ono
Oh no, he didn't. Yeah I did
I butt fuck ya, in the back of the pick up truck, sucka
I'm sick. Again, baby dick
My rhymes are unique, all you other rappers out there talking about packing heat
You ain't got a gun, you ain't shooting no one
The only thing you shooting, is a photograph of your grandma in Houston
Man I'm just the best
Your dad got an inverted chest and a long back, that means no ass
I be out, smoking grass
Your dad is fucking a bastard, and you are too because he died in Alaska!
Man I don't give a shit, I'm Dirt Nasty and I'm legit
Yeah that's me, stone cold like ice creamery
Whats up bitches? You know my tits delicious
And I don't do dishes, I got a girl for that... vicious
Dirt Nasty baby, dirt nasty baby. 
Got the retro nefertiti hat
Your dad got a fucking brokeback mountain
I'm climbing in a water fountain
I'm doubting your skills, I'm better than all you rappers, for reals
And I'm just a cracker actor, bad at it, bad habits
Halibut... shaft, I'll shaft your fucking dad's dick, and slice it off
