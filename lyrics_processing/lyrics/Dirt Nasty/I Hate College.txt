Yo, this is motherfuckin' Asher Roth
Hangin' out in Castle Creek chugging water
Rappin' to horsies with my fuckin' man, Dirt Nasty
Stretch Armstrong, this is the fuckin' White Album

Yeah, I never went to college
So I , you know, I don't really got too many story to tell
But fuck college, you know what I mean
Get your dick sucked

That party last night was off the chain but I didn't make it
I got bad grades so I stayed home, alone and faded
Smoking beer and drinking weed
I flunked English and history
GPA a 1.3
Can't get into university
Man, I hate college

I can't go to college, man god dammit
No chasing girls all over the campus
'Cause man I can't understand it
It's off to Devry to be a mechanic, shit
Frat boys, you can suck a dick
With that chug-chug shit, chug on this
I get 40s, pour it in my mouth
From gorgeous whores at your sorority house
I never got my edumacation
So I sneak in the library, hit on Asians
Honkies too, I'm not racist
If you dumb like me, all I can say is...

Man, I hate college

But I love drinking
And I love women
But I hate college (Fuck college)

I can't say that I'm really mad, but wait
Suck my dick before you graduate
A keg party, that gives me a happy face
I ain't invited, suck the rattle snake
Fuck your alumni
I shroom with your girl, she thinks I'm a fun guy (Ooo)
She was taking back shots
From me while I was dressed like a mascot
That's hot, that's collegiate
I throw up all over your Tempur-Pedic
Snorting whiskey, drinking cocaine
Got kicked out of college on the very first day
That party last night was off the chain but I didn't make it
I got bad grades so I stayed home, alone and faded
Smoking beer and drinking weed
