Ever since I was a little kid
I been looking for a chick with perfect tits
And a big old ass and a pretty face
But I can't seem to find them all in one place
So I hop on a plane down to Brazil
Trying to find a girl that looks like Gisele
If you party like me, Dirt Nasty
I be looking for a nasty girl

I been looking all around the world
Been looking for a nasty girl
I need a girl with a gold chain
Not a diamond ring and pearls
I been looking all around the world
Looking all around the world
I been looking all around the world
Been looking for a nasty girl

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your nasty stick
You might also like
Even if she was a perfect ten
That don't mean shit 'les you bring
Cause I'm a dirt dog and a jerk off
At the club with a flask full of Smirnoff
I take your shirt, take your skirt off
I need a freak with knees that got burn marks
If you party like me, Dirt Nasty
I be looking for a nasty girl


Every girl got a little bit of freak in 'em
They just gotta get a little bit of me in 'em
In the twilight, put my teeth in 'em
We don't need children, we can be children
I need a girl that plays with toys
I need a girl that can hang with the boys
I need a girl that brings the noise
And let's me dip it in the milk like Chips Ahoy

Hey girl, this is Dirt Nasty
You know I've been looking all over for you
Europe, South America, Asia, Hollywood
I just wanna find a freak that will share me with her best friends
With the green  and satin leather
