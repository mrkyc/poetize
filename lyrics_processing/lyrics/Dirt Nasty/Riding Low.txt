Dirt on the left titty, Nasty on the right
Riding low
Bitch, I'm so high
Your chick's panties are matching my bow tie
Riding low
Bitch, I'm so fly
When I roll by the ladies say "Oh, my"
Riding low
In a 45 low ride
Bitch, I shine like a gold mine
Riding low
You wanna know why?
Cause my car look like a boat when It float by
Uh, burn rubber motherfucker
In the 600, got your lover number's on the under
With a  but it's the summer
Got the top down, staying cooler than a cucumber
Even Stevie wonder how I do it
Ghostride the whip, blindfolded in a Buick
So, quote me on this cupid
Twisted like Rubiks, my diamonds look stupid

Riding low with your mom
In the Louis Vuitton champagne Rolls Royce
So you know that it's on
Pass the Grey Poupon (x4)

Now I got a chauffeur
I'm in the back doing blow in the old fur
And it don't hurt, that my wrist stay frozen like yogurt
Riding low
Panty loafers, slow motion coast the Range Rover
Riding Low
I pop a boner, roll by slow with a Parrot on my shoulder
And I got bad news, me and your bitch getting bad tattoos
Dirt on the left titty, Nasty on the right
But I guess that makes sense, cause I'm nasty on the mic
Pull up {?] in a flatbed truck
And drop of the Rrari in front of the club
I don't drive it, I just stand beside it
Take a couple pictures, zero mileage

Ain't nobody ride low like me
Cadillac SUV
Ain't nobody ride low like this
Just me and your girl, and her big o'l tits
Dirt on the left titty, nasty on the right
But I guess that makes sense, cause I'm nasty on the mic
Nasty on the mic, nasty on the mic
Riding low with your mom
In the Louis Vuitton champagne Rolls Royce
So you know that it's on
That it's what? That it's on
That it's on bitch, that it's on
Burn rubber bitch
