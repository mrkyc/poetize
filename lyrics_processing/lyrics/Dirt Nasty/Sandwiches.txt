I know you want to do it (You want to do it)
You know I want to do it too (I want to do it too)
Out here on the dance floor (Get my dicked sucked)
Or we can make sandwiches (Mmmm)
You can be the bun (Get over here, bitch)
And I can be the burger, girl (Suck your tits)
I know you want to do it (You want to suck my sandwich)
And we can make sandwiches

Put some mayo on the buns, now we're getting started
After that, I'ma put in the hard salami
Oh yeah, girl it's just that simple
Chips on the side, hold the pickle
La-di-da-di, we like havarti
Cheese and I'm back at the sandwich party
Let us dance together forever
Then shake my dick like salt and pepper

I know you want to do it (You want to do it)
You know I want to do it too (I want to do it too)
Out here on the dance floor (Yeah baby)
Or we can make sandwiches (I'm hungry)
You can be the bun (I'ma give you mayonnaise)
And I can be the burger, girl (Give me fries)
I know you want to do it (Ice cream shake)
And we can make sandwiches (Suck my dick)

Those tomatoes are so plump and juicy
And I cry when I see that onion booty
Your tuna salad be smelling fishy
But bologna tacos are oh so crispy
Hey girl, I ain't got much bread
But I fuck you good and leave crumbs in your bed
Make your thighs like butter, easy to spread
And we can make sandwiches and shit

I know you want to do it (I think I want to do it)
You know I want to do it too ()
Out here on the dance floor ()
Or we can make sandwiches (i'm so hungry too)
You can be the bun (I'm high as shit)
And I can be the burger, girl (Suck your tits)
I know you want to do it ()
And we can make sandwiches (Dessert on my dick)
