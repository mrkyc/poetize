They Call me Beardo
You think I give a fuck? It's the trailer park hero
Drinkin' Jack Daniels
I'll be at NASCAR if you wanna tango

I be rangelangin' 'em up
Dirt Nasty grab the bull by the horn buck
I'm tacky as fuck
Blue cowboy boots, made outta duck dick

Killed both my parents
(Why'd you do it beardo?)
It was self Defense bitch
And I got a problem with narcotics
The CIA be watchin my apartment

Take off your top bitch
I raid the cupboard at the orthodonist
While I beat up a handicap
Redarded dumb fuck dick with a fanny pack

Drugs
On my mind
Drugs
All the time
Drugs
Hard to find
Drugs
On the grind

I fathomed my head in the reflection
Of the '68 firebird I stole in Houston Texas
I'm addicted to Co-'caine
And all types of other medication man

My step dad's a tweaker
He made speed with a bunch of ether
I never had a Easter
But I always had a bunch of speakers

I'm a one man band on E
Keep on trucking to your town on 18
Wheels not inches
White boys always get they're dick sucked at Winchell's

"Bitch clean the dishes!"
I slap ya face, having you be wishing
I heard a man want a fight
He a black belt, bitch I got a buck knife

The white ski slopes in Van Nuys
They've always been there open your eyes
Beardo's the truth
Take me to ya dealer lets do some 'ludes

I've been on more drugs than Courtney
Love-to-stick-my-dick-in-a-hole like Porky's
I ain't trippin' dude
Get my dick sucked in the conference ro-oo-oo-om, shit

Well let's leave it at this
Me and dirt nasty we fucked your bitch
And don't say shit
When you get your wig split
Or your neck slit

Now everybody say "Suck my dick"
We shoot to kill, you ain't shit, bitch
Me and Beardo wasted
I took a molly, he took a straight hit
