Now here's a little story I got to tell
About me and Legacy at the motel
It started way back in room 15
With three hookers and PCP
The room started melting and changing colors
We brought the drugs, they got the rubbers
I passed out naked in my baseball hat
The bitches woke me up with the bump of gak
One OD honky I be
Thank god I'm with the Leg-a-rochi
Pulled out my penis and aimed it at the sky
I yelled "Open up!" and let my balls fly

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want
I fill up your tank with my pump
Don't play me out like a chump
I come to your house and take a dump
Don't you know the situation, hun
I put my hotdog inside your buns
No ketchup, no mustard
But I relish the muffin while my meat's in your oven
I love it, I can't lie
Girls with  at 12:45

Cause I'm a white cane sniffer, take a picture
The white cane sniffer, bone your sister
The white cane sniffer off the ricter
Pack my beak on the sink like a ninja
Come on, I party gnarly
Doing Charlie up the Ferarria car keys
Don't doubt my parallel parking
I do it perfectly while cocaine farting

I'm Andre, I got nothing to lose
Pay attention my intention is to bust a move
Got mics, guns, drugs, and bitches
Between my legs I got an Uzi and 
Cooler than a girls room bathroom stall
Three bitches doing coke off my eight ball
I got a cap, not a visor, I drink Budweiser
Stretch Armstrong got the tables on fire
Snatch your gold chain right off your neck
I got your money and your honey and a baby dick
One for all and all for one
Taking out whack rappers with my BB gun
All for one and one for all
With me and Legacy in a stolen car
Racing girl chasing, we got that feeling

There's this bitch I know that's new in town
Quick to suck your dick and pull her panties down
Jump in the cab, late to the party
Drunk as fuck, drinking Brass Monkey
Bitch was a bum, breath was funky
In Tijuana she'll fuck a donkey
She's nasty, she likes to fight
She's nasty, she's just my type

I'm like a secret agent, tour around the nation
Dirt Nasty, I was on vacation
Ain't got a job, fuck a 9 to 5
Me and my crew cold kicking it live
Lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
Get my dick sucked at 7/11
I used to be all on the TV shows
Now I smoke crack with trashy hoes

It's the Legacy in the place to be
Smoking dust with Dirt Nasty
On the streets, me and my homies
Drinking OE and eating Rice-A-Roni
Hip-hop body rocking, do what it do
Lean sipping,  tripping sniffing glue
Take a J train to the Brooklyn Zoo
 with a bunch of Jews
They got a committee to put away my cock
Cause I pull it out quick when I'm on your block
Being bad news is what it's all about
We went to In-N-Out and we got thrown out
I got Armstrong and the Legacy
I got all the fly ladies getting nasty
Jizzed in her face but the nut was a duz
