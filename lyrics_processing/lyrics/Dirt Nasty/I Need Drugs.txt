Yo, wassup baby
This is Dirt Nasty and shit
Oh, whatcha smoking on? 
Yeah, oh fuck yeah, I hit that shit bitch

When I alone in my room, sometimes I starred at the wall
'Cause the acid I drop got me straight trippin balls
My mom walked in and she look like a bug
For the first time in my life, I know: I need drugs
There I was  face
'Cause she's started to talk like she's from outta space
 - and all the shit that I heard
Took a look in a mirror man, I saw big birds
I can feel it insise, I can't explain how it feel
But if you ever tripped out then you know the deal
I busted out some blow, chopped it on on the flo'
Snorted it up and then I snorted some mo'
Then she slammed the door and she started to cry
Why oh why does my baby get high?
 can't believe that I found
The vicodin, I thought I lost, sittin' there on the ground

I need drugs (oh yeah)
I need drugs, I need some drugs right now
I need drugs (oh yeah)
I need drugs, gimme some drugs right now

Heroin... she a delight so sweet
I gotta find a little speed to make my high complete
So warm inside the ice got me nice
Giggigigidigy gi man I'm feeling alright
And the china white got me eat my own bubble
I lay down my coke so we can walk over a 
It's deja vu: whenever I sniff glue
PCP, baby, I thought you knew
And those Quaaludes are neither here nor there
I swear I can't find them anywhere
Damn sure aren't in my closet? Or under my rug?
This drug search is really making me bug
And if you know where you are
Why don't you make yourself seen?
No, I ain't clean, Dirty Nasty's a fiend
Pipe dreams can run but they can't hide
And when I find you I'ma pour some GHB inside

I need drugs (oh yeah)
I need drugs, I need some drugs right now
I need drugs (oh yeah)
I need drugs, gimme some drugs right now

Ay man! Sometimes I be sitting in my room alone and shit
Starring at the wall... And I realised I need drugs
So if out there shit I'll pay you tomorrow
I'll suck your tits, ooh
I wanna kiss you hoe
You roll you up and light you
Catch you fire like Bob Marley but I'mma white dude
 I need drugs back
I got money and I wanna buy a hold damn bag
I watched the sun rise lonely and naked
Boney and faded, so opiated
See what I mean I'm changed I'm no longer
Junkie on a run, I need something getting stronger
The meth, xanax, hash and ex
And if the cokes uncut we'll be having sex
I can't sit and wait for my dealer to arrive
Now I don't get high, I just get by
I'm searched the whole world for that special something
And if I don't get it I'm punchin someone

I need drugs (oh yeah)
I need drugs, I need some drugs right now
I need drugs (oh yeah)
