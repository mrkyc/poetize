Shit's getting magical
I'm a drug addict but my life ain't tragic
I'm straight up living lovely
This my best friend and he loves me

And I ain't that ugly
But your bitch so old
She looks
Nah I ain't racist but I hit

Everything's palatial
Ain't no reason to get racial
We about to go get a facial
Manicure, pedicure, amazing

My balls are raisins
Wrinkled up man, you should taste 'em
It's like you're at a vineyard
Oh, can I taste that  from Michigan

Dirt Nasty and the Legacy
Ain't a rapper alive that can get next to me
I take ecstacy and other drugs
Yes please

Bill Bellamy used to be my homie
Until he whipped out that black balogna
I said "chill"
At the same time, man shit got real

Was that them old MTV days
When you was in the crazy drug phase
Living in New York City
And fucking all bitches with the big ass titties

Nah fuck titties, I'm an ass man
My body is the drug trash can
I should've been in Afganistan
But I'm a pussy so I kick it with my Africans

I'd never go to war, that shit is wack
I'd rather tour
Go fuck bitches from here to New York
And come back and show em the 

You, you want dick galore?
Well lucky for you, you knocked on the right door
Cause I'm a white whore
And I might score if you give the gash gore
Por favor, do you know who I am, whore?
I'll slap you like a whore
You make me snore, you I ignore

I buttfucked your grandma
That pussy tasted like the tampon
But it tasted like depends
Blood, shit, it never ends

I'm possessed, all I want is porn and sex
I was born to die
Fuck you and your DUI

And I was born naked
I walk in buttfucking an Arabian
Or was she Jamaican?
I don't know but the body was banging

He ain't faking
I ain't Muslim, asalamalakem
I'm straight up Christian
And my shit's bitching
Hotter than a kitchen
Yeah, I don't talk religion
But if I had to, I'd say it like this man
I'm Jewish as fuck
And you can tell cause my nose bigger then Donald Duck dick

I'm straight up Catholic
I told the nun that I have a dick
Straight for your face
I pulled it out, gave her a taste

Bitch, you a gonner
You trying to come to my house, doing some laundry
Man, fuck that
It's about time for you to feel the *chick chick* blast

Boom, that's how it goes
When the gat between your toes
I'll blast your feet
Talk to your mom, I'm blasphemy

Yeah, I eat red meat when I eat vegetables, beets
I'm hella-fucking-healthy
You think I'm gonna rhyme that shit with "wealthy"

No way, he's stealthy
Walk through your crib and start getting creepy
That's how we do it
Andre Legacy, I got the fluids

And my dick is Jewish
But my balls are Buddhist
Fuck it, I'm a nudist
And I'm not prudish
But I'll hit you with a prune right under your rude fish

I ain't Ralph Macchio
But I eat your ass up like carpaccio
Delicious, the Legacy, my balls is nutritious

Bitch, do the dishes
That's all your worth about
That's word of mouth
I heard you could scrub a dish
