I fell in love with a gangsta bitch
A chola chick that'll shank your dick
Bitch from the other side of town
I live in the Hills, she from South Central
And she got a tattoo on her neck
Of Lady Guadalupe holdin' her tits
I met her up at the Del Taco
I said "You hella fine," she said "You el guapo"
She was like "I don't date crackers or actors"
"Matter of fact, I'm a rapper"
I thought she'd never get with me
But she saw me on Cribs rappin' with Mickey
I put the hickey on her titties
Now her cousin Smokey wanna kill me
At the barbecue I stood out
I was the only woodpecker in the motherfucking crowd

Cracker ass fantastic, that's me
Cracker ass fantastic Dirt Nasty
Cracker ass fantastic, that's me
Cracker ass fantastic, word hit the street

So I slap-boxed her cousin
At the Jack in the Box by the Inglewood Forum
Straight got my ass beat but I
Still hit them ass cheeks, uh
She taught me how to load the Glock
And she taught me how to fold my socks
So I taught her how to hold my cock
And I told her "You can quit your job at Ross, baby
'Cause now you're with the number one gringo
No more Doritos or frozen burritos"
Have you ever been to Fred Segal's?
Thirty dollar salad with a bottle of vino
You can play with my dick under the table
I got the tip covered, thank you
Dirt Nasty's el fuego
That means I'm on fire, baby, like Waco

Cracker ass fantastic, that's me
Cracker ass fantastic Dirt Nasty
Cracker ass fantastic, that's me
Cracker ass fantastic, word hit the street

I think I hear wedding bells
And I don't give a fuck that her fish taco smells
She stole a Chevelle
That's what she told me when she wrote me from jail
She Oakland as hell
Raider hat to the back, Gold Cazals
Centerfold, Lowrider mag
Other crackers jack it to pictures of her ass
She thinks I'm an asshole
'Cause I can't eat her out without using Tabasco
Mommy looked saucy in a poncho
When she dumped my ass at the Pomona car show

Cracker ass fantastic, that's me
Cracker ass fantastic Dirt Nasty
Cracker ass fantastic, that's me
