Is to have no wife
But to have some kids
With a fat-ass bitch
In the middle of Texas
With a fake gold necklace
It's swinging and dangling
You'd think I was Arabian
Wait a minute man, who is this?
Is you an actor or a rapper
I'm a ractor
I'm Ludacris
In a Uber with a stupid bitch
Her name is
Fuck I can't remember shit or anything
Look down and seen a wedding a ring
Her husband's on amphetamines
Running looking hella mean
I'm grabbed my dick and grabbed the clip
And pop pop pop shot his ass in the ribs
It was a limited time shooting
The sushi is bluefin
I'm bad bitch recruiting
Lately
I've been a crispy baby
All the ladies wanna date me
From L.A. to Haiti
Ima need eight days a week
To heal my dick
Cock stick on fleek
You might also likeI'm the nicest
I got beef with ISIS
I got a white bitch
The ass is priceless
I been rappin since you was swimmin in your dad's nut sack
Fuck that
You kids gotta learn
Hipsters will burn
It's Dirt Nasty's turn on the mic
Sike
Your dad's a dyke
I stole your bitch
Then I stole your bike, bitch
Somebody gotta talk this shit
All these rappers went soft
These dicks went limp
But not me though
I sniff a kilo
And unfollow everyone that asks for a repost
All you Tweeters are making me sick
Get on your knees
And suck this verified dick, baby
I got a black belt in yoga
Your bitch got a boner
When I did downward cobra
It's straight verbal diarrhea
Your mom got pneumonia, SARS, syphilis and gonorrhea
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
All the ladies wanna date me
From L.A. to Haiti
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
All the ladies wanna date me
From L.A. to Haiti
I'm a baby
Who's oh so crispy
And I owe it to my folks
They were both hippies
Kinda trippy how it all happened
I started playing ball
Then I started freestyle rapping
Had a gift right from the jump
Had a white dick
That fit perfect in a penis pump
Chumps wanna hate
Let 'em hate
I never hesitate to put a punk in his place
Snuff 'em in the face with a body blow
I got a dojo
I should have my own karate show
Hotties know
I got the beef stick
I'm Rocky 4
You're pussy like Heathcliff
I'm a magical Merlin
For certain
Got your girl's toes curlin
And squirting out of beef curtains
Now that was a little too graphic
I used to get my ass kicked
After basketball practice
Now I get my ass licked
By African models
Whose tongues doin magic tricks
Rabbit dicks
Coming outta black hats
Shotgun Uzi
I pack that
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat
On any tattletale
That be talkin out his ass crack
Abide by the g-code
I learnded that shit in the pen
When I was three years old
I learned about life in juvie
And I learned about your wife in my jacuzzi
I studied the anatomy
Then I dropped her fat ass off at Applebee's
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
All the ladies wanna date me
From L.A. to Haiti
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
All the ladies wanna date me
From L.A. to Haiti
I'm a crispy baby
I'm a crispy baby
