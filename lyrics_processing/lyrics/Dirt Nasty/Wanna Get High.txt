You wanna get high?
I wanna get high
You wanna get laid?
I wanna get laid
You wanna get drunk?
I wanna get drunk
You wanna get paid?
I wanna get paid

I woke up chasin' the dragon
Doin' shit you couldn't imagin'
Fathom the Legacy with a phantom
Doin' drugs alone in the attic

I'm an addict addicted to habits
Suckin' the tinfoil dick like a savage
If my dad wasn't such an asshole
I wouldn't be such a junkie bastard

Shit's crazy
My girl hates me because my lifestyle's shady
Up all night, up all day
No sleep till Brooklyn, I'm on the road again
You might also like
I've been doing heroin
My manager said I look very thin
Skin greener than an alien
And both my eyes are hella bent

You wanna get high?
I wanna get high
You wanna get laid?
I wanna get laid
You wanna get drunk?
I wanna get drunk
You wanna get paid?
I wanna get paid
You wanna get high?
I wanna get high
You wanna get laid?
I wanna get laid
You wanna get drunk?
I wanna get drunk
You wanna get paid?
I wanna get paid

I'm sittin' in an A.A. meeting
Wasted, hittin' on bitches that are weaklings
I'm a liar, always cheatin'
On so much drugs I hurt my own feelings
I said "Fuck school
I'm a loser, I got drugs to do"
It's so confusin'
If it ain't my woman, it's me I'm abusing

I should get help
When I do coke, I fuckin' hate myself
I'mma do everyone a favor and slit my wrists
Uh, see you later

Lately I been faded
Joined the dark side like Vader
Everybody is a hater
Fuck your mom for makin' you

You wanna get high?
I wanna get high
You wanna get laid?
I wanna get laid
You wanna get drunk?
I wanna get drunk
You wanna get paid?
I wanna get paid
You wanna get high?
I wanna get high
You wanna get laid?
I wanna get laid
You wanna get drunk?
I wanna get drunk
You wanna get paid?

Too bad I won't go to rehab
Detox, then a relapse
It's sad when I look in the mirror
I see the devil, ain't no angels in here

I smoke coke straight out the pipe
And rode a white horse through the night
Woke up, I was on my bike
Butt naked on the 405

I pray to God to forgive me
For all the shit I did to my liver and kidneys
Smoke weed like a hippie
Do more blow than Jack Nicky

I've been up for six days in a row
Doin' blow with a gay ghost
But I ain't got a problem, B
That's what I told my grandma, rest in peace

You wanna get high?
I wanna get high
You wanna get laid?
I wanna get laid
You wanna get drunk?
I wanna get drunk
You wanna get paid?
I wanna get paid
You wanna get high?
I wanna get high
You wanna get laid?
I wanna get laid
You wanna get drunk?
I wanna get drunk
You wanna get paid?
