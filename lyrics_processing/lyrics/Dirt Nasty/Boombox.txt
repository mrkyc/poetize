Boombox, boom-boom-boombox
Boombox-box-box, boombox
Boombox, boom-boom-boombox

My boombox loud as a mother
The EQ be changing colors
Red, yellow, blue, green
Like a Christmas on PCP
Here playa, you can feel the bass
Bigger than your grandmaw's suitcase
My boombox got 10 inch tweeters
Pissing off all the Puerto Ricans
Big and black, heavy as fuck
And it don't play music that sucks
No CDs, just cassettes
Hanging off your shoulder, it'll slang your neck
JJ Fad, Supersonic
Sticker on the back says Stetsasonic
You can feel it bump around the block
I can't live without my boombox

Boombox, boombox, boombox
Boombox, boombox, boombox
Boombox, boombox, boombox
So hot, make you call the cops

Boombox, boom-boom-boombox
Boombox, boom-boom-boombox
Boombox, boom-boom-boombox
So hot, make you call the cops

Waterproof, works in the shower
Double D battery, super power
And the beat goes on for hours
Never touch a white man's radio, cowards
It's a boombox, it ain't a cantaloupe
No fruity shit like Barry Manilow
Magnavox, Sanyo
Turn it up, drop your panties ho
Got my own fucking radio station
Coming to you live from your momma's basement
Put it on 10, shake the pavement
Can't even hear the neighbors complaining
Touch the knob and you might get slapped
Ask Schooly D or Kool G Rap
Too Short, BDP
Just suck my dick to the beat


You put the boom in my boombox
Boombox, boombox
Boom in my boom box
So hot, make you call the cops

My boombox is a ghetto blaster
You piss your pants like a yellow bastard
You girl friend said turn it down
So I slapped the bitch and turned it up louder
Fuck your surround sound
You can hear my shit from the Hills to downtown
Shit's obnoxious
On the porch butt naked, pop lockin'
It's all distorted
When I bust a freestyle, I always record it
And fuck you ravers
Put the house shit in, it'll chew your tape up
I'm bumping Slayer
Make you go Def Leppard, all you fucking haters
Strictly mixtape
If I play my shit, it'll make your tits shake, bitch
