Hey girl, what you wanna do?
Come back to the motel room
It's cool, I ain't gonna bite
Pull those panties to the right

Hey baby, do you like it rough
She told me to shut the fuck up
Orgasms, she had them
Then I busted out the magnum
She got dick and bit my neck
Don't leave a mark cause my girlfriend trips
We can keep this on the low
And I'll call you a taxi cab in the morning

Where we at? (In the motel room)
Getting ass (In the motel room)
Getting smashed (In the motel room)
(Motel room)

Wake up, you gotta go
Got another freak knocking at the door
Don't trip, I'll call you later
Wait, can you leave your pink vibrator
She decided to stay
Okay, we can have a three way
Order up some champagne
Mane, you know I bring the damn pain
Wait, now we getting bubbly
They took some X and both started cuddling
And you know I took pictures
Introduced them to my best friend Richard
Also known by his nickname Dick
Now let's , bitch
Dirt Nasty, game over
They wasted, I remain sober

On the sunset strip, the neon light glows on her tits
55 bucks for the night
Doing cocaine til the sun rise

1, 2, come to my room
3, 4, we can fuck on the floor
Suck dick at the Motel 6
7, 8, gonna check out late

Uh-huh, put it in your mouth
Butt fucking on the dirty ass couch
And I don't trust the towels
There's someone's hair all up in the shower
We swinging from the chandelier
They don't care, I'm a regular here
Do not disturb, homes
Dirt Nasty killed two birds with one bone


Mmm that's so good Dirt Nasty
Thank you so much
I wanna see you tomorrow
Come by to 304
Yeah, oh Dirt Nasty
Oh, Dirt Nasty
