Yeah alright, I'm fucked up, yo

I got a problem with all pharmaceuticals
I eat 'em up 'cause they make me feel beautiful
Slurp them up, woof 'em down like candy
Don't care if they're Valium or Xannies
Let me explain all the different prescriptions
Some for pain, but let's get specific
Opiates come from the poppy
They break it down to heroin or oxy
Morphine, Vicodin, and Roxies
Or Percocet, let's choppy-choppy
'cause you can sniff them, eat 'em or shoot 'em
But be careful if you don't know what you're doing
I recommend that you eat 'em
Give it twenty minutes then see you you're feeling
Feel nauseous, vomit on the carpeting?
Then they work, back to the pharmacy

Where we going? Back to the pharmacy
Where my pills at? Back to the pharmacy
I'mma get fucked up
Where we going? Back to the pharmacy
I need my fix. Back to the pharmacy

Ya'll can call me Rush Limbaugh
Roaming the halls at the hospital
Ativan and Klonopin make you mellow like Rastafarian
Any problem, they can fix it
But watch out, they mega addictive
Wanna be in a coma?
Take muscle relaxants, aka Somas
Make you never wanna leave the sofa
Best part? No hangover
And all girls like Adderall
Sniffing it up it in the bathroom stall
Then they bounce around like basketballs
Having sex like animals
I'm getting bored I think it's time to party, B
Let's roll, back to the pharmacy

Where we going? Back to the pharmacy
Where my pills at? Back to the pharmacy
I'mma get fucked up
Where we going? Back to the pharmacy
I need my fix. Back to the pharmacy

Yeah all you kids out there just listening to Dirt Nasty
Do not take those pharmaceutical drugs in your grandparents or your parents pill bottle
Without me
I love you
Suck your own dick
