Sun came out on the prairie
The cows producing dairy
Water's more refreshing than the wilderness
Late for a rambling evening
And all the animals are leaving
I turned to my lady and I say "Suck my dick"

The mountain view's panoramic
God bless America, I love Montana
Mountain men on horses
They ride through the night, deeper than a forest
We camping by the lake
This is God's country, butt knife cut the steak
Pass down the can of beans
And the KC Masterpiece
Ain't that some tasty beef?
I hunted that cow down in her sleep
Jesus fuck, what a beautiful day
The air's so clean, fuck L.A
The eagle has landed
You city folk just don't understand it
I shot her out the sky with my hand cannon
Now that's what I call ranching
You might also like
Sun came out on the prairie
The cows producing dairy
Water's more refreshing than the wilderness
Late for a rambling evening
And all the animals are leaving
I turned to my lady and I say "Suck my dick"

That's me at the Dairy Queen
Blizzards and burgers ti'l they bury me
Y'all can kiss my degenerate ass
Got a tat on my balls of the confederate flag
I stared at her dad
When he told me the baby was black
I ain't coming back
I'll be at the bar with Red and Jack
Get drunk and start a scuffle
With some city slickers that don't want trouble
Meet me at the dock of the bay
I'll be wasted, cock in your face
I tread through the swamp
With a big ol' white honky-tonk-dong
Catfish and bears beware
It's hunting season and my dick's in the air
Sun came out on the prairie
The cows producing dairy
Water's more refreshing than the wilderness
Late for a rambling evening
And all the animals are leaving
I turned to my lady and I say "Suck my dick"

Hey Dale Earnhardt, rest in peace
Hey Mabel from Memphis, thanks for swolling my load at that truck stop
Dolly Parton, thanks for having them big ass titties
Hey Toby Keith, I'll put a boot in your ass, motherfucker
Jeff Foxworthy, fuck you, yeah fuck you
Hey Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, suck our dicks
Hey Clint Eastwood, fuck you! Make my daddy talk, bitch
Hey leader of the KKK, eat a dick
Rest in peace to who? John Denver, the godfather of this shit
Oh yeah, and don't eat at the Waffle House in Charlotte
