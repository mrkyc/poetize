Hey baby recognize me
That skinny white boy from MTV
Uh huh and Scary Movie 3
I'm rappin' now they call me Dirt Nasty
And I'm almost famous
Signing autographs with my balls in your anus
Bright lights, big city
Write my name on your girlfriend's titties
All you girls wouldn't fuck me before
Cole dissin' my ass cause I didn't have dough
Now you like cause I'm on TV
Money and fame, getting pussy for free
You might also like

Hollywood, city of dreams
Gold chains on the silver screen
In bed with the illest freaks
I killed the pussy like I killed this beat
I'm in U.S. weekly again
For fuckin' Martha Stewart fresh out the pen
At the IV eating BLTs
Butt lickin' time on TMZ, come on
Used to be D-list before I made it
Fucking fat chicks just to pay rent
Now that I'm on top of the A-list
Wanna fuck me? You gotta go through my agent

Gettin' pussy was always easy to me
Maybe cause I was on TV
Your mom and your aunt both want my meat
That's cool we can keep it in the family
Gettin' pussy was always easy to me
Maybe cause I was on TV
Your girlfriend wanna eat my meat
What's my name bitch? Dirt Nasty

Fame is a funny thing
I almost got it
And when I do, you know I'ma go crazy
And get my dick sucked in Cabo San Lucas
On my private yacht airplane combination Ferrari
Dirt Nasty, baby
