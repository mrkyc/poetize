I'm a animal lover, my dog knows
Every single night I fuck her asshole
While the cat just stares (what the fuck you looking at)
And video tapes it underneath the chair
And my bird is fucked
'Cause he's locked in a cage and he beaks at my nuts
Snakes got weird pussies
It's like putting your dick in a bigger dick that's juicy
I gave a roofie to a monkey
She got bananas in the 'cuzzi
Have you ever fucked a falcon?
After you cum, they fly to the mountain

(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover, a animal lover
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover and I never use rubbers
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover, a animal lover
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover and I never use rubbers
(I'll be good)

I can't hang at the zoo
Cause they caught me banging a kangaroo
I got an ostrich with awkward tits
That sucks my cock in the office bitch (come here)
You might also likeHey yo who's that dude over there
Butt nude with his tube in a polar bear? (Oh my God!)
That's me Dirt Nasty
Sheep in the mirror, dick in the buttcheeks
Gorillas in the mist know
When I come to the Congo, grab your dildos
The great outdoors
Mother nature, what a fucking whore

(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover, a animal lover
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover and I never use rubbers
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover, a animal lover
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover and I never use rubbers
(I'll be good)

The best part about fucking a horse
Is after he rides you to the forest
Penguin pussy cold as fuck
And I hold the bill when I bone a duck
Meet me at Kinkos by the copy machine
With my dick in a pink flamingo
Candle light dinner with a goose
Whisper in her ear "is your butthole loose?"
She said "quack quack quack quack quack"
I smacked her; I'm an Oakland cracker
I fell in love with a fatass cow
Now we getting married down south

(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover, a animal lover
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover and I never use rubbers
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover, a animal lover
(I'll be good to you) I'm a animal lover and I never use rubbers
(I'll be good)

Mr. Dirt Nasty, do you take this cow to be your wife?
"Fuck yeah"
And Mrs. Cow, do you take Dirt Nasty to be your husband?
"Moo"
