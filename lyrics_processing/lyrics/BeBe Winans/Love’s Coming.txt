The world and ecstasy
But all you've given are material things
When what I'm looking for
Sums up to so much more
And if nothing else I'm sure I'm not settling
I lay awake in bed
Wonder what lies ahead
And in tomorrow said, what will it bring
No more concern myself
About this commons wealth
My futures on the shelf and I still believe
I'm waiting, waiting is easy
'Cause I know, love's coming
And make it alright
Can't worry, don't see the need to
'Cause I know love's coming
And make it alright
It's not a game i play
When asked if I'm okay
I've learned to smile and say
Everything's fine
I made my heart decide
Oh, yes, I will survive
It's time to come alive
My turn to shine
You might also likeMy course about to change
It feels a little strange
Leaving behind the pain
I've known all my life
Oh, it's time to soar above
I know this must be love
You are the meaning of
And won't say goodbye, goodbye
I'm waiting, waiting is easy
(Waiting is easy)
'Cause I know, love's coming
And make it alright
(Say, make it alright)
Can't worry, don't see the need to
(Worry, just don't see the need to)
'Cause I know love's coming
Say, and make it alright
Only thing I need to know
(All you need to know, I'm yours)
And I'll never let you go
(Never let you go, said, I'm waiting)
I've waited patiently
(I'm waiting patiently, and right now)
And now you're standing here
(Right next to me)
Next to me
(So glad I waited)
I'm waiting, waiting is easy
(Waiting is easy)
'Cause I know, love's coming
And make it alright
(You make it alright)
Can't worry, don't see the need to
(Can't worry, just don't see the need to)
'Cause I know love's coming
(Hey!)
And make it alright
(You make it alright)
I'm waiting, waiting is easy
(Waiting, I'm waiting for you)
'Cause I know, love's coming
(Coming, and make it alright)
And make it alright
Can't worry, don't see the need to
(Ah, worry, just don't see the need to)
'Cause I know love's coming
('Cause I will, hey)
And make it alright
I'm waiting, 'cause waiting is easy
Love's coming and make it alright
Can't worry, don't see no need to worry
