With words I heard once before
Just who you are is still unclear
Knowing one day you will leave
To my surprise and relief
Love was the reason you came here
Yeah, glad you came
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, came
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You said love was the reason
Where can I start, where do I begin?
I feel the need to explain
I'll be the first to say life is good
But first let me tell you my pain
I've been around the world
Searching for love
And right before I came to my end
I can remember
You came and knocked at my door
(Oh, my door)
With words I heard once before
(Before)
Just who you are is still unclear
(Just tryin' to figure out)
Knowing one day you will leave
(Will leave)
To my surprise and relief
(Oh, relief)
Love was the reason you came here
