Took some time to come around
Realize how I let you down
A bit too late for sorry now
My pride got in the way
Yes, it did

I thought I had it all figured out
I needed time away to work it out
And now that I've learned what it's all about
And all I need is you in my life

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long (Much too long)
This is where I want to be
So I'm coming home, coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

Somehow I lost my way
Mistakes I made I have to pay
It hurts to know still today
That I wasted so much time
You might also like
And after all is said and done
There's more to life than having fun (Oh yeah)
Ain't no doubt, you're the one (You're the one)
And all I need is you in my life

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long (Been gone much too long)
This is where I want to be (Oh yeah)
So I'm coming home, coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

Oh, just to be in your arms is like heaven to me
Your love, your love is all that I need
So I'm coming back home (Coming back home)
And I hope you forgive all my wrongs (All my wrongs)
So I'm coming home, coming home
'Cause home is where I belong
Hey, hey, hey

So I'm coming back home
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long
This is where I want to be
So I'm coming home, coming home
'Cause home is where I belong
So I'm coming back home
(I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home)
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long (Been gone, been gone)
This is where I want to be (Where I wanna be)
So I'm coming home, coming home (I'm coming home)
'Cause home is where I belong
(Ah yeah) (Oh, yes, I am) (Oh yeah) (Say it again)
So I'm coming back home
(Said I'm coming back home)
Home, where love is waiting for me
Been gone much too long
This is where I want to be (Want to be, yeah)
So I'm coming home, coming home
'Cause home is where I belong

So I'm coming home
