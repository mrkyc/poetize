When my world was burning
Spinnin' outta control?
Tell me, where were you
When the tears are fallin'
And the cold wind started to blow?
See, baby, that's the time
When the heavens reveals
Who stays and who has to go
And when I needed Him most
He was there for me, there for me
He is somebody who is faithful to me
Someone the time has proved
You can be there
And if you call, no matter where
Is everything okay? I'm on my way
Now that's a friend
Somebody you can lean on, laugh and cry
Not only words but actions exemplify
You don't have to have a reason why
I'll be there for you to catch you through
Yes, that's a friend
Now you were there for me
And I wanna thank you
I'm sure, you already know
You're such a gift from God
I will take for granted right now
I just wanna show
Show you the way I feel
What I think about you
I think you're pretty okay
When I needed you most
You were there for me, there for me
