All I wanted was to be loved
No one deserves to be alone
Accused for taking love for granted
But now I see (If I don't share the way I feel)
They way I feel (How can you know?)
How can you know? (Now I'll forever let it show)
To let it show, so

(I felt by writing this song) Mmm, I felt by, by writing this song
(It would reveal all my heart) And tell you the way that I'm feeling
(The way that I feel) The way I feel
(I feel like telling you) Telling you
(How much) How much
(I love you so)
Oh no special reason (No special reason)
I just thought (Just thought you should know)

When those dark clouds arrive to harm me
I don't get afraid, I give you a call (Oh yes)
For all that you do, I just want to thank you (Thank you)
Oh I should of said it
(If I don't share the way I feel, how can you know?)
Cause I need you to know
(Now I'll forever let it show) To let it show, so
You might also like
(I felt by writing this song)
By writing this song, writing this song
Yes, it's your song (It would reveal all my heart)
And tell you the way (The way that I feel)
The way that I'm feeling
(I feel like telling you how much)
Telling you how much (I love you so)
Said there's no special reason (No special reason)
I just thought (Just thought you should know)

Said I thought you should know (You should know)
This is coming from my heart
(Thought you should know)
Yes it is
That I'll never ever part (Thought you should know)
Thought you should know
That it was love from the start (From the start)
(If I don't share the way I feel, how can you know?)
(Now I'll forever let it show)
Let it show, say it

(I felt by writing this song)
Hey, it's a love song from me to you, I'm writing this song
(It would reveal all my heart)
And tell you the way that I'm feeling
(The way that I feel) The way that I'm feeling
(I feel like telling you how much)
Telling you how much I love you (I love you so)
Said there's no special reason (No special reason)
I just thought (Just thought you should know)
Today I felt
(I felt by writing this song)
Writing this song, writing a love letter
(It would reveal all my heart)
And tell you the way that I'm
(The way that I feel) The way I'm feeling
(I feel like telling you how much)
Sweet Jesus
