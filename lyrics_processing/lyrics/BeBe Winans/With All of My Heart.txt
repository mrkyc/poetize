I was lost without a purpose
Not a clue of what to do
Here alone without a reason
You appeared right out the blue
You offered me a mansion
More than a pocket full of gold
More than just the riches
You came and rescued me

And I will always love you
(With all of my heart) All of my heart
'Cause I knew you love me
(Right from the start) Right from the start
Said you made a promise
(To never part) Oh, to never ever part
That's why I love you
(With all of my...)

Now in every complications
I know just where to go
And in every situation
You care always shows
You're always there to guide me
And there to lend a hand
Your love has never failed me
And you'll understand, oh...
You might also like
And I will always love you
(With all of my heart) With all of my heart
'Cause I knew you love me, yes you did
(Right from the start) Right from the very start
And you made a promise
(To never part) To never ever part, oh
That's why I love you
(With all of my...)
Oh

(Here to testify) Said I'm here to testify
(Tell the reason why) Why that I love you
(Why that I love you) Said I love you
(With all of my heart) Oh, yes I do
(Here to testify) Oh, to tell everybody, to tell everybody

Said I'll always love you
(With all of my heart) Said with all of my heart
'Cause I knew you love me, yes you did
(Right from the start) Right from the very start
Then you gave me your word
(To never part) To never ever part, oh
That's why I love you, yes, I love you
(With all of my heart) Said with all of my heart
Said I'll always love you
(With all of my heart) Said with all my heart and soul
'Cause I knew you love me
(Right from the start) And you never let me go
Then you made a promise, yeah
(To never part) To never ever part, oh
That's why I love you, yes, I do
(With all of my...)
Oh, all of my heart, yeah
Said I love you all my mind
For the rest of my days
Said I love you, yes I do
So don't ever leave; don't don't don't ever go
