A Great American sign
And proclaimed you know
The Emancipation that brought
A beacon light of hope
To plenty of slaves
Who had been seared called Negroes
The flame of injustice
And now a hundred years have passed
And now today we must face
The true tragic facts
The Negro is still not free
And though impossible it seems
I have a dream
The Constitution reads
And gives the promise
That all men be guaranteed
Pursuit of happiness, pride of life and liberty
A check of independence cash and decree
But it is obvious America's at fault
Default on its promises gave citizens of all
And now we must demand our right to be free
'Cause I have a dream
I have a dream, a dream that one day
Black boys and black girls will join hands
With white boys and girls and we'll stand
Sisters and brothers
Yes, I have dream, a dream that one day
The mountains and hills be made low
And all the world is told
The crooked's been made straight
Till His glory is seen, I have a dream
You might also likeTo overlook the urgency
It would be fatal to deny equality
The autumn of freedom, the year of 1963
But a beginning of the end of will be
But there is something
I must say to my people
Who stand on the threshold
Into the palace where we go
Let's not be guilty of violence and wrong deeds
'Cause I have a dream, hey
I have a dream, a dream that one day
This nation will rise up and see
The truth of this creed
And equal all men will be
Yeah, say, I have a dream
A dream that one, one day
With a new meaning we will sing
"My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty"
Ooh, freedom will ring, will ring
'Cause I have a dream
And if America is to be a great nation
This must become true
So let freedom ring
From the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire
Let freedom ring
From the mighty mountains of New York
Let freedom ring
From the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania
Let freedom ring
From the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado
Let freedom ring
From the curvaceous slopes of California
But not only that, let freedom ring
From Stone Mountain of Georgia
Let freedom ring
From Lookout Mountain of Tennessee
Let freedom ring
From every hill and molehill of Mississippi
From every mountainside, let freedom ring
I have a dream, a dream that one day
Black boys and black girls will join hands
With white boys and girls and we'll stand
Sisters and brothers
Yes, I have a dream
A dream, a dream that one day
The mountains and hills be made low
And all the world is told
The crooked's been made straight
Till His glory is seen, is seen, I have a dream
Freedom will ring
'Cause I have a dream
Oh, though impossible it seems
I have a dream
Sons of former slaves
Snd the sons of former slave owners
Will be able to sit down together
At a table of brotherhood
I have a dream
Yes, I do
For the rich and poor man
Oh, I have a dream
When all of God's children
(And for the black men and white men)
Black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles
Protestants and Catholics
(Jew and Christian)
Will be able to join hands and sing
(I have a dream, yes, I do)
In the words of the old Negro spiritual
Free at last, free at last!
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
My four little children
Will one day live in a nation
Where they will not be judged
By the color of their skin
But by the content of their character
