Outrageous but I don't often show that side
I can be selfish but I can be a saint sometimes
You make me feel like I'm bigger than who I am
I can see everything but mostly I'm blind
I'm a sinner but sometimes I shine
I'm just a man but sometimes I feel like a lion
You make me feel like I'm bigger than who I am
When you're near...
I hear you... I want to hold you up
When you feel you can't go any longer
I'll help you get back up when you feel you
Can't get any stronger
Don't be frightened when
You hear the rising distant thunder
Don't be hiding
I'm a coward but a hero in a good fight
I can be confused but watch if I know I'm right
Sometimes I can get so close
But sometimes I'm right out of sight
You make me feel like I'm bigger than who I am
Sometimes stupid
You might also likeBut sometimes I'm pretty damned bright
I can get real moody but I'm okay on a good night
And when the fog rolls in
You make it roll back again
When you're near
You can be an angel, you can be pretty wild
You can be a strong woman
Or sometimes just like a child
So aloof and proud, or you can scream real loud
Make you feel like I'm bigger than who I am
...When you're near
I hear you
Come see me come on, come on, come on, come on out
I hear you
Come on, come on, come on, come on out
I want to hold you up when you feel
You can't go any longer
I'll help you get back up when you feel
You can't get any stronger
When you hear the lighning and the distant thunder
