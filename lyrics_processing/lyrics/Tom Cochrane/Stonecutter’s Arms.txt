Nearly drove him crazy
Took him for all he was worth
That wasn't much
But still they kept in touch
And now they're back in time down
At the stonecutter's arms
There's old tuck man
He's down on his luck man
Some days he's wasting away
There's a place where
Tuck will soon fly there
A toast to his charms down at the stonecutter's arms
We're outta harm
Down at the stonecutter's arms
Raise a glass or two and maybe smash a few
Well that's o.k
They break their backs all day for you
Life is short they say down at the stonecutter's arms
I'll remember, remember always
Have a toast down there
A toast to her charms
Give it all day
Life is short they say
There's a hearth there
At the stonecutter's arms
You might also likeWhat won't kill you will only make you stronger
Ties that bind there you can never put asunder
Look into her eyes and I can see the world's a wonder
A toast to your charms down at the stonecutter's arms
We're outta harm
Down at the stonecutter's arms
Raise a glass or two and maybe smash a few
Well that's o.k
They break their backs all day for you
Life is short they say down at the stonecutter's arms
CHORUS
I'll remember through the valleys
In the streets and down the alleys
Give it all day
When you're done
There's a hearth there
At the stonecutter's arms
I had a friend whose dad died in his arms and it
Broke his heart for a while and it turned him to stone
But I knew he'd get around it
It only made him stronger
Once in a while you look in his eyes you know
He's not alone
These are the things that carry with you
You're never alone
What won't kill you will only make you stonger
Ties that bind there will never put asunder
Look into her eyes and I see the world's a wonder
A toast to your charms down at the stonecutter's arms
