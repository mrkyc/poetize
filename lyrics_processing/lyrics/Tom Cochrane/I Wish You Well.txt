Gonna cash my chips and roam
Gonna walk before you fade to black
I'm gonna write a new resume
I'm gonna write you off the page
Gonna take what we might take away
And you might find a brighter day
You might find a brighter day
Oh, and in another year
The pain will disappear
And I will look back on this life as if it were a scene
In a film somebody made for you and me
I wish you well
Oh, I wish you well
I wish you well
She wants to be set free
Wants the space to feel love and be angry
And I, I watch her bounce off the walls
While the chips, they start to fall
Then in a little while I see that distant smile returning
Just like a ghost in a dream that we had way back when
Then she'll turn and smile and say, come again
Oh, and in another year
The pain will disappear
We'll look back on this life as if it were a scene
Somebody wrote about you and me
Somebody made about you and me (I wish you well)
You might also likeI cannot believe there's nothing left to save
Hard as a hammer she wants me
To come again and again (and in another year)
I'm down on my knees (the pain will disappear)
Won't you come again
Don't you need relief
Don't you need relief
And in another year
The pain will disappear
And I will look back on this life as if it were a scene
And in a little while
I'll see that distant smile returning
Just like back in the days when we were so naive
In a film somebody, somebody made
I wish you well (I wish you well)
Oh, I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
