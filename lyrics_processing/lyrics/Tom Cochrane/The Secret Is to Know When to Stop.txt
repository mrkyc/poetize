All along the promenade
It started to rain my coat, your dress got wet
We laughed till we almost cried
Your spirit was so contageous
Our timing really bad
You were so outrageous
How could we hold back?
The secret is to know when to stop...
The secret is to know when to stop...
The secret is to know when to stop...
Remembering
Do you remember the night that we ran out
Out on the English Bay
We went out on the water
The tow almost pulled us away
Man, right there the sparks would fly
We'd get into such a mess
Our timing really stunk back then
We didn't give a damn what they thought, I guess
The secret is to know when to stop...
The secret is to know when to stop...
The secret is to know when to stop...
Remembering
You might also likeAnd maybe when the skies flew open
Right then the lines would be broken
Your eyes they did all the talking
Keep your heart open wide
Whoa-ooo
Can you remember the trip we took
In the Malibu to the west coast
We drove through a rainbow up on Roger's Pass
They never thought you'd get that close
The secret is to know when to stop...
The secret is to know when to stop...
The secret is to know when to stop...
Remembering
The secret is to know when to stop...
The secret is to know when to stop...
The secret is to know when to stop...
Remembering
The secret is to know when to stop... (The secret is to know when to stop)
The secret is to know when to stop... (The secret is to know when to stop)
The secret is to know when to stop... (The secret is to know when to stop)
