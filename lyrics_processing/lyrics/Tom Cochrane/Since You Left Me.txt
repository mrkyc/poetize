The world's frozen in like it's brought and sold
The days turn to night and that's all I know
Since you left me here
Since you left me my car won't run
The sky's turned black and eclipsed the sun
I try to laugh but this ain't no fun
Since you left me here
Since you left me
It's like I'm goin' insane
My mood is heavy
Like a ball and chain
Sky is dark like it's always rain
Since you left me
Since you left me here
Since you left me it's no big deal
I can play the game but
I lost my feel
Things come undone just like it's unreal
Since you left me here
Sing about it like San Antone
The Alamo and all I own
Everything's gone South
And that is what I know
Since you left me here
You might also likeSince you left me
It's like I'm goin' insane
My mood is heavy
Like a ball and chain
Sky is dark like it's always rain
Since you left me
Since you left me here
Since you left me here
Since you left me it's the end of days
I go to move but I'm lost in a maze
The sun is up high but it's lost haze
Since you left me
Since you left me here
Since you left me it's the end of days
I go to move but I'm lost in a maze
The sun is up high but it's lost haze
Since you left me
Since you left me left me here
Since you left me there's a hole in space
I go to go but I stay in one place
I look in the mirror but I've lost my own face
Since you left since you left me here
Since you left me the world's gone mad
The seas dried up and it makes me sad
Everything's good has turned too bad
