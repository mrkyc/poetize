And the outlaws, and the hustlers, and the heroes
That never seem to fall
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what
The outcome of the story is
Because in real life I try to tell her
It's not like that at all
Oh, won't you please just hold out now
'Cause there's some things I'd like you to forget
When your world is sinking like a sunset
Tales of Don Juan, they're very poetic, babe
But out on the streets out there
The true verse of life is written
You know it's really a shame
When you've got to let go of all the things you love
Like a fighter he really bleeds
When he must hang up his gloves
No I am not a rock and I can feel it now
But for a moment, I'd like to forget
That my heart is sinking like a sunset
You might also likeNo no no no no no no no
Sinking like a sunset
No no no no no no no no
Sinking like a sunset
No no no no no no no no
Everybody has a story
Some are tragic and some find glory
But it feels more real when you're here
Right next to me
You can walk too far out on that ledge
And you might lose your mind
You know I need you now
You're the angel that keeps me in line
The old sergeant has broken down
He's grown senile
He shouts, "kill the bastards!" in the night
'Cause he's all out of time
So don't hold out, let's make love right now
'Cause there's some things I'd like to forget
When our hearts are sinkin' like a sunset
Won't you hold me now and make things alright
'Cause when you're with me here
The sun comes out at night, making me forget
We're sinking like a sunset
No no no no no no no no
Sinking like a sunset
No no no no no no no no
Sinking like a sunset
No no no no no no no no
Sinking like a sunset
No no no no no no no no
Sinking like a sunset
No no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no
