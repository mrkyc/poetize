Maybe I'm just crazy, maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I don't know how to love, but maybe I do
Maybe you know more than me, but this much is true
This little heart and brain of mine say we're through with you

And I wonder does it blow your mind?
That I'm leaving you far behind
I wonder does it stop your heart to know
You're not my sunshine, anymore

Okay, you're pretty, your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up New York City after dark
Okay, you're Cover Boy pretty, stamped with a beauty mark
But it's such a pity, a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart

Maybe you'll get married, and she will kiss your feet
While I give all my rides away, I won't lose no sleep
Maybe on your honeymoon you'll think of me
But if you don't, won't shed a tear, yeah I can guarantee

And I wonder does it blow your mind?
That I'm leaving you far behind
I wonder does it stop your heart to know
You're not my sunshine, anymore
