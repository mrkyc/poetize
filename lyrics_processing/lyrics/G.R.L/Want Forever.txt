I don't need excuses, we can let it be whatever
But if you want a good time, then we should be here together

'Cause if tomorrow never comes, tonight will open up for us
Right here, it's only you and me
Under the lights, we're wild and free

Baby, you're sexy and you know
Get your ass up on the floor
I'ma make your body want forever
Tell me what you're waiting for
I'ma have you wanting more
I'ma make your body want forever
Saying na na na na, oh
Oh na na na na, oh
I'ma have you wanting more
I'ma make your body want forever
Saying na na na na, oh
Oh na na na na, oh
I'ma have you wanting more
I'ma make your body want forever

We could paint the world on fire like it's now or never
Go on and let it burn down, I promise we can do it better
