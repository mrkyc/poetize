When it gets real, just know that I'll be there
I got your back, like it's just you and me here
I'll go to war for you, let them bring it
I'll take on the world for you, better believe it

So if you need me, just holla my name
We ain't ever scared, no, we're not afraid
Whenever, whatever, know I'm down for life
I'm your ride-or-die

When the night gets cold and the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
And you feel lost and I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse

Woah-oh, woah-oh
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Woah-oh, woah-oh
I'll guide you home

Whenever you're down, I'll lift you up
People gon' hate, let them hate on us
Our movement too strong, our clique too deep
'Cause I got you, and you got me
You might also like
So if you need me, just holla my name
We ain't ever scared, no, we're not afraid
Whenever, whatever, know I'm down for life
I'm your ride-or-die

When the night gets cold and the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
And you feel lost and I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse

Woah-oh, woah-oh
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Woah-oh, woah-oh
I'll guide you home

If you ever need me, know I'll be there (Know I'll be there)
Don't you ever be afraid to call ('Fraid to call)
I'll be waiting over the horizon (The horizon)
Don't you worry, I'm not very far (Very far)
I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, don't be afraid
When the night gets cold and the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
And you feel lost and I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse
When the night gets cold and the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
And you feel lost and I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse

Woah-oh, woah-oh
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Woah-oh, woah-oh
