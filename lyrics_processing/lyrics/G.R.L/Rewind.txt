I wish you would come knock on my window
Climb into bed and lay with me
We could believe that just for one night
Things were the way they used to be
I wish we could laugh without a reason
When it was real and not pretend
Now looking back, it makes me wonder
If it could be that good again

Cause right now
It feels like this flame's gonna burn out
What happened to us?
It's true
Even though you're here, I still miss you
I hope there's something left

If you want this love, say you won't give up
Take my hand, I can show you if you let me
Look into my eyes, let's go back in time
Take a chance, baby why don't we just press rewind, rewind, rewind?
Baby why don't we just press rewind, rewind, rewind?

Remember the times you sang me love songs
But they were always out of key
All of my girls thought you were crazy
But it was magical to me
How did it get so complicated?
When did the clouds turn into rain?
Now looking back, it makes me wonder
If it could ever be the same
You might also like
Cause right now
It feels like this flame's gonna burn out
What happened to us?
It's true
Even though you're here, I still miss you
I hope there's something left

If you want this love, say you won't give up
Take my hand, I can show you if you let me
Look into my eyes, let's go back in time
Take a chance, baby why don't we just press rewind, rewind, rewind?
Baby why don't we just press rewind, rewind, rewind?

That first night, run it back
That first kiss, run it back
Yeah, just like this, run it back
That first time, run it back
First 'I love you', run it back
I said it too, run it back

If you want this love, say you won't give up
Take my hand, I can show you if you let me
Look into my eyes, let's go back in time
Take a chance, baby why don't we just press rewind?
If you want this love, say you won't give up
Take my hand, I can show you if you let me
Look into my eyes, let's go back in time
Take a chance, baby why don't we just press rewind, rewind, rewind?
Rewind, rewind
Baby why don't we just press rewind, rewind, rewind?
