With all upon my shoulders
Think I'd cry without a love to keep me warm
And I'm sure
The faithfulness grows older
I'm as useful as a broken man's reward
And so I sit
But never see
How someone so desired could fall for me
Well it's just one kiss
And it'll all crash down
Ignorance is bliss
In this cold and wet town
If I could bring myself to venture through
This bold and bruised door
Then I might make it
An' I might make it
Yeah I might make it (x2)
And so I try
With all upon my shoulders
With a single glance she cuts me to the bone
You might also likeAs I stand
Regret the things I told her
Cause the years can teach you things days never know
And so I sit
But never see
How someone so desired could fall for me
Well it's just one kiss
And it'll all crash down
Ignorance is bliss
In this cold and wet town
If I could bring myself to venture through
This bold and bruised door
Then I might make it
Yeah I might make it (x5)
I don't want to leave
I don't want to stay
But you tear me up
With those insecure ways
I don't want to leave
I don't want to stay
But you tear me up
With those insecure ways
Insecure ways (x3)
Well it's just one kiss
And it'll all crash down
Ignorance is bliss
In this cold and wet town
If I could bring myself to venture through
This bold and bruised door
We might make it
Well it's just one kiss
And it'll all crash down
Ignorance is bliss
In this cold and wet town
If I could bring myself to venture through
This bold and bruised door
