She said I've fallen far too soon
I said she's acting cold as ice
I want more than tomorrow brings
The midnight flights on your angels wings
Of a dove, it's a mad little thing called love

She said boy I'm an uptown girl
Living my life in a downtown world
The downtown world is a life that's in my blood
I said girl I'm an uptown guy
Living my days on a downhill slide
Look in my eyes, it's written in the stars above
It's a mad little thing called love
It's a mad little thing called love

I said she's moving far too fast
She said I'm scared of crossing lines
She wants more than the future holds
Like diamonds set in a ring of gold
Oh love, it's a mad little thing called love

She said boy I'm an uptown girl
Living my life in a downtown world
The downtown world is a knife that's in my neck
I said girl I'm an uptown guy
Living my days on a downhill slide
Look in my eyes, it's written in the stars above
It's a mad little thing called love
It's a mad little thing called love
You might also like
I won't spin you like a coin in days of thunder
Just don't sweep me like a toy

She said boy I'm an uptown girl
Living my life in a downtown world
The downtown world is a life that's in my blood
I said girl I'm an uptown guy
Living my days on a downhill slide
Look in my eyes, it's written in the stars above
It's a mad little thing called love
It's a mad little thing called love

She said boy I'm an uptown girl
Living my life in a downtown world
The downtown world is a life that's in my blood
I said girl I'm an uptown guy
Living my days on a downhill slide
Look in my eyes, it's written in the stars above
It's a mad little thing called love
