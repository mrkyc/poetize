Flashes of lightning, buckets of rain
Hitting down hard upon the back lane
Everyday seasons in a satellite town
Remembering stories of summer long weeks
Hourlong kisses on the back seat
Everyday dreaming in a satellite town

What can we become
If we never want to change

Cause I'll pretend that I'm a winner
I'm a loser that can lie
And how I wish I was a fighter
But I've been running for the whole of my life
I wanna be a free spirit
But I need somewhere I belong
How can something that feels so right
Make me feel so wrong?
Oh, how could I be so wrong?

We live for the weekend, rewind and repeat
Stumbling home along the backstreets
Everyday dealings in a satellite town
Well, our heads are full of these stupid ideas
Still thinking we're living through our college years
It's an everyday feeling in a satellite town
You might also like
Cause I'll pretend that I'm a winner
But I'm a loser that can lie
How I wish I was a fighter
But I've been running for the whole of my life
I wanna be a free spirit
But I need somewhere I belong
How can something that feels so right
Make me feel so wrong?
Oh, how could I be so wrong?
Oh, how I could I be so wrong?

What can we become
If we never want to change
I've let my colours run
And I've let my colours fade

Cause I'll pretend that I'm a winner
But I'm a loser that can lie
How I wish I was a fighter
But I've been running for the whole of my life
I wanna be a free spirit
But I need somewhere I belong
How can something that feels so right
Make me feel so wrong?
Oh, how could I be so wrong?
Oh, how I could I be so wrong?
