You give me something
No one can
You get me going so I feel
Like I'm superman
When I wake up
Dreams are true
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

You know my secrets
No one knows
You take me places that I have
Never dared to go
I get lost and
Your eyes are blue
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

Darling move closer
Don't care what the people say
Sing along to the morning
And dance the night away
All around the stars
Stars are falling
Don't care what the people say
Sing along to the morning
And dance the night away
All around the stars are falling
You might also like
You make me shiver
Right to the core
Wanna do things I never
Thought I'd do before
Lose my senses
To your perfume
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

Don't care what the people say
Sing along to the morning
And dance the night away
All around the stars
Stars are falling
Don't care what the people say
Sing along to the morning
And dance the night away
All around the stars are falling

Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Stars are falling
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na na na
No no no

Don't care what the people say
Sing along to the morning
And dance the night away
All around the stars
Stars are falling
Don't care what the people say
Sing along to the morning
And dance the night away
All around the stars are falling

Na na na na na na na na na na na
Stars are falling
Na na na na na na na na
Stars are falling
