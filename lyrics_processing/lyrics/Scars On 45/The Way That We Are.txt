You're the only one I see
We have ventured far and wide
In the hope that you'll believe
That every waking day we find
Will reveal an open door
You turned my life around
But I don't need you anymore
We risked our lives on a feeling
It could all work out, realize that
You're wrong when you're leaving
And nothing you do could change it
Well, maybe I could say what you say
If only I could do as you do
Darling, the way that we are
Will always be the reason we loose
I can feel the sting in your stare
You'll never see the hole in my heart
But whatever, you didn't carry me this far
Well, I could hide my love away
As we walk with head in hands
When every lesson learned
Could be the reason why you ran
You might also likeAnd now your only hope is
With the only friend you'll see
With friends as good as yours
There's no need for enemies
We risked our lives on a feeling
It could all work out, realize that
You're wrong when you're leaving
And nothing you do can change it
Well, maybe I could say what you say
If only I could do as you do
Darling the way that we are
Will always be the reason we loose
I can feel the sting in your stare
You'll never see the hole in my heart
But whatever, you didn't carry me this far
We have fought in the pouring rain
Just to hide our tears
The only thing you gave to me
Is a feeling that I've lost
(Yes)
Couldn't turn my days around
Of believing what you say
Without walking out
We risked our lives on a feeling
It could all work out, realize that
You're wrong when you're leaving
And nothing you do can change it
Well, maybe I could say what you say
If only I could do as you do
But darling the way that we are
Will always be the reason we loose
I can feel the sting in your stare
You'll never see the hole in my heart
But whatever, you didn't carry me this far
Well, maybe I could say what you say
If only I could do as you do
Darling the way that we are
Will always be the reason we loose
I can feel the sting in your stare
You'll never see the hole in my heart
