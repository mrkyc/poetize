Take me for who I am
With all this confusion and days of delusion
Take me for who I am
Or you can turn your ass around

'Cause I don't care what you believe in
Got no time for rhyme without reason
Make no boasts
Boy you're no troubadour
So what are you waiting for
I see the look in your eyes
It tells me now  you realise the score
So what are you waiting for
So what are you waiting for
So what are you waiting for

I'm tired of those games they play
I know where I'm movin, we're on a road to ruin
I'm tired of those games they play
Cause we're growing older
I'm not giving in, I'm just starting over

'Cause I don't care what you believe in
Got no time for rhyme without reason
Make no boasts
Boy you're no troubadour
So what are you waiting for
I see the look in your eyes
It tells me now  you realise the score
So what are you waiting for
So what are you waiting for
So what are you waiting for
You might also like
So if it all goes wrong and the last bell rings
I'll count on myself to find the confidence I know I'm needing
If it all goes wrong, they won't find me being so heartless
'Cause a star can't shine without days of darkness

'Cause I don't care what you believe in
Got no time for rhyme without reason
Make no boasts
Boy you're no troubadour
So what are you waiting for
I see the look in your eyes
It tells me now you realise the score

So what are you waiting for (Don't care what you believe in)
So what are you waiting for (Too tired for rhyme without reason)
So what are you waiting for (Don't care what you believe in)
