So much reminds me of you
And i miss your smile
10:01 and this night is gone
I spent it ill while the world moves on
If time alone was the brushed that paints
With solace and misfortunate
My life would be a work of art
But ive seen this all before
Things shouldn't have gone this far
We shouldn't have gotten so close
For what made me believe
Was this the girl who made him forget all hes known
Everytime he looked into her eyes
Was it the boy who decided to give up his heart and run away
Today is gone
Tomorrow's mine but im still alone (breath deep)
Im still alone (keep breathing)
Im still alone (keep singing)
Im still alone
Im still alone (keep breathing)
Im still alone without you
Bleeding out so much more
Spilling blood since you left
If i had a second chance id live my life waiting to death
You might also likeSo i walked to the store
Spent a buck fifty in quarters
To buy the ring you said you liked
Cuz im thinking of you now
Now i drive to the coast
The place where i drowned all my fears
Let the water set me free
Im screaming, can't you hear?
Or is this the end of everything i love
Or are we destined for more?
Why can't you look me in the eyes and tell me what you want to
I know you want to.. so bad.. so bad
But ive seen this all before
Things shouldn't have gone this far
We shouldn't have gotten so close
What made me believe?
It was you who made me forget all i had known
Everytimg i looked into your eyes
And it was me who decided to give up my heart and run away
Today is gone
Tomorrow's mine but im still alone
Im still alone
Im still alone
Im still alone
Im still alone
