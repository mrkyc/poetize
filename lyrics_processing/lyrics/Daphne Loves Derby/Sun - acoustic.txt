I'll be deep asleep
I've been awake for days
Tryin' to study
Every inch of your body
In this picture
From a distant day
When I could safely say
Nothing in this world
Could tear me down in any way
But like a dream
You disappeared
Without a sound
Without a trace
Sleep well, darlin'
Where ever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found someone to love you right
Sleep well, darlin'
I'm desperate to say
Now I need you more than ever
But all I could say was goodnight
This is for a girl back home
She tore down all my walls
Left me for all she'd known
But I pushed it all away from me
And no, no
Even if i knew
Even if i knew what to say to you
It's just to late to make you stay
I'm sick of fighting
This broken fate
And someone else gets to tell you
That you're beautiful
Sleep well, darlin'
Where ever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found someone to love you right
Sleep well, darlin'
I'm desperate to say
Now I need you more than ever
But all I could say was goodnight
It's the last thing I want
But it's all that I've got
It's the last thing I need
But it's to carry you in my heart
In my heart
It's the last thing I want
But it's all that I've got
It's the last thing that I need
But it's to carry you in my heart
In my heart
Sleep well, darlin'
Where ever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found someone to have you right
Sleep well, darlin'
I'm desperate to say
Now I need you more than ever
