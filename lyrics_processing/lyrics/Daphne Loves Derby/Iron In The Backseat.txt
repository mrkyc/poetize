Before she burns the skin beneath my sleeves
My sleeves
She's not convinced, she's not convinced
When I try to keep a straight face when we kiss
When we kiss
"And no one comes to bed to sleep"
You said, you said when you talk in your sleep, oh
I want to run, I want to run
But you've got the gun pointed right at me
Won't you believe me, oh
Believe me tonight, oh oh oh
You've got control but I don't mind
Call us out on our mistakes
Call them all just fun and games
We act and react all over again
But it's all the same
And if you ever find yourself a mile
Or two away from my place
Won't you stop for a while
And kill me while I'm sleeping, love
I'm not afraid to make the same mistakes that you make, oh
Come on, come on, don't keep me waiting
I know, I know where this is going
We fall apart without intentions
But I can't deny that I didn't think ahead, oh
You never mean to, you never mean to
But you've got me tied so tightly to your wrists
You might also likeCall us out on our mistakes
Call them all just fun and games
We act and react all over again
But it's all the same
And if you ever find yourself a mile
Or two away from my place
Won't you stop for a while
And kill me while I'm sleeping, love
If you ever want some trouble
But can't afford the alcohol
I'll be here, I'll be here waiting
I'll be here, waiting for you
Call us out on our mistakes
Call them all just fun and games
We act and react all over again
But it's all the same
And if you ever find yourself a mile
Or two away from my place
Won't you stop for a while
