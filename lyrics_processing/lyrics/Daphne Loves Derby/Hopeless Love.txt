200 miles beneath this lake is where my heart belongs
But you don't care at all
You wouldn't even smile if I were screaming as the water filled my lungs
You demand to be chased for your love
My desperate heart is far too weak to run for you this long
But you don't care at all
There's nothing I can do to draw you close to me
Can you take this silence like a pill so I can breathe again?
I've been trying to ignore the best parts of you
I'm still hoping that I'll be with you somehow
Please be home tonight
I'll die if I don't get a chance to make this just right
I'm sorry but I can't forget about the way I feel every time you're here
What would it take for me to be with you?
I swear I'd rip my heart out if you said you'd be impressed
Please be impressed
I'd go so far to please you but I bet you wouldn't care at all
Oh, at all
Hopeless love, please leave me
This broken heart is far to weak to run for you this long
Why don't you care at all?
I'm dying for a place in your heart

I've been trying to ignore the best parts of you
I'm still hoping that I'll be with you somehow
Please be home tonight
I'll die if I don't get a chance to make this just right
I'm sorry but I can't forget about the way I feel every time you're here
Hopeless love, why did you carve your home in me?
This broken heart is too weak to hold your weight
And now I regret the day we met
