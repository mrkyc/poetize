I hope you're deep asleep
I've been awake for days
Trying to study every inch of your body
In this picture, from a distant day
When I could safely say
Nothing in this world
Could tear me down in any way
But like a dream you disappeared
Without a sound, without a trace
Sleep well, darling, wherever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found
Someone who will love you right
Sleep well, darling
I'm desperate to say
Now I need you more than ever
But all I could say was goodnight
This is for a girl back home
She tore down all my walls
Left me for all she had known
But I pushed it all away from me
You might also likeAnd no no, even if I knew
Even if I knew what to say to you
It's just to late to make you stay
I'm sick of fighting this broken fate
But someone else gets to tell you
That you're beautiful
Sleep well, darling, wherever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found
Someone who will love you right
Sleep well, darling
I'm desperate to say
Now I need you more than ever
But all I could say was goodnight
It's the last thing I want
But its all that I've got
It's the last thing I need
But i still carry you in my heart
In my heart
It's the last thing I want
But it's all that I've got
It's the last thing I need
But i still carry you in my heart
In my heart
Sleep well, darling, wherever you are
I hope that you're happy tonight
And maybe you found
Someone who will love you right
Sleep well, darling
I'm desperate to say
Now I need you more than ever
