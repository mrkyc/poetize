I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long
Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you been so long
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungles burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long
It's been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Ya wouldn't believe what I've been thru
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline
You might also likeSee these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
Yeah, I could stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been thru
Yeah, you've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline
It's been so long
It's been so long
It's been so long
It's been so long
It's been so long
It's been so long
I've been putting out fire
(It's been so long)
It's been so long
(It's been so long)
I've been putting out fire
