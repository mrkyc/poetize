And them ol' cowboy singers always steal the show
From Waylon to Willie, from Lubbock to Greune Hall
From 'Bonnet Bowl to Alex Jones, you can say they got it all

So do I
She's as tough as saddle leather
As sweet as that chocolate pie
Oh brother don't you cuff her
'Cause she's ornery when she's high
Do you love Texas? (Hell yeah!)
So do I

To little Hank and Little Elle to Floore's Country Store
Yeah, get yourself a t-shirt in Luckenbach before you go
And say "Hey" to Ray in Austin and Remember the Alamo
