May look kind of strange
Kind of rough all around
You don't know what I've been through
But you'd better not stare
Better watch your mouth boy
Don't be fooled
No need to be scared
But you need to be aware
You think you own this town
I don't care
At the ridge they bare
I'm just looking for some brothers in arms
And the woman with the long dark hair
Don't call an outlaw, no
I'm a motherfuckin gunslinger
You wanna run your mouth all day long
You'd better keep your eye
On my motherfuckin trigger finger
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Some people think they know me
Think they can predict me
Think they gotta diss me when I'm not around
And when I come dark and in the door
They get weak in the knees and crumble like a castle to the ground
'Cause they know I ain't taking no shit
I got a woman who left me
White with a heart of cold stone
When they see the black in my eyes
They see a man so deep in the red that it chills them to the bone
You might also likeDon't call me an outlaw no
I'm a motherfuckin gunslinger
You wanna run your mouth all day long
You'd better keep your eye
On my motherfucking trigger finger
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
I'm just cold as the day is long
And I'm lost and lost so song
So you best just move alone
And I'd love to be alone...
Oh, don't call me an outlaw
I'm a motherfuckin gunslinger
You wanna run your mouth all day long
You'd better keep your eye
On my motherfuckin trigger finger
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
Do you feel me punk?
I'm as cold as the day is long
And I'm lost and lost so song
So you best just move along
