But you threw it away
And you made it clear I was not welcome on these seas
And you threw it away
(So in exile)
So I sailed and I sailed for so long
My hair grew long and my heart grew cold
I face certain death without you near
And I felt the storm and swam until the skies were clear
And I found a home along this crooked road
And all of this would have been
All of this could have been yours
All of this should have been
All of this could have been yours
Black clouds roll, right over red doors
As the waves were high
Sooo was I
And the moon never looked so angry
As when your walls came crumbling down
It was so beautiful
It was so peaceful
You might also likeAll the destruction, it was quiet
All of this would have been
All of this could have been yours
All that you love, will be carried away
Oh all that you love, will be carried away
All of my pain, that you put on my name
All of my doubt, and all of my shame
All of my guilt, my denial and fear
All of my hatred and all of my tears
All of the time that I couldn't go home
All of the times that I froze all alone
All of the sadness all of the lies
All of the shadows that blackened my eyes
All of the servants, who cheated, who stole
All of the colors from the depths of my soul
All of the wounded, that you left for dead
Now creep in the corner, they're all in my head
All of the dreams that you made nightmares
All of the silence, deafening stares
All of the ships who can't carry loads
You wrecked in anger, along distant shores
All of this would have been
All of this could have been yours
All of this should have been
