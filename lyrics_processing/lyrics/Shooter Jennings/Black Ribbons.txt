Can't seem to get anything right
So numb I can't feel things anymore
Somehow could feel me letting go
I know there's so many things
That I need to do and I need to say
No matter how hard I try
I can't get the words out right
Man down, tie a ribbon around my soul
I'm in the black and I'm out of control
Like a ship that's lost in the night
With no direction or guiding light
Man down and I'm drowning in the pain
Face down like a needle in the vein
You're the only thing that keeps me sane
But somehow I can't keep you out of my rain
I see you standing in the rain
The lights in the city feel so bright
All these colors I've got inside
And in these streets I feel like a foreigner
All I paint is myself in a corner
You might also likeGoing on seems to hurt so much
All the world seems so cold to the touch
When I go to sleep I don't dream
I just see a blank television screen
Man down, tie a ribbon around my soul
I'm in the black and I'm out of control
Like a ship that's lost in the night
With no direction or guiding light
Man down and I'm drowning in the pain
Face down like a needle in a vein
You're the only thing that keeps me sane
But somehow I can't keep you out of my rain
I see you standing in the rain
Tie a ribbon for the child in me
On every door and on every tree
Make it black for the way that I feel
'Cause black is the only color that's real
Man down, tie a ribbon around my soul
I'm in the black and I'm out of control
Like a ship that's lost in the night
With no direction or guiding light
Man down and I'm drowning in their pain
Face down like a needle in a vein
You're the only thing that keeps me sane
But somehow I can't keep you out of my rain
I see you standing in the rain
Broke down at the end of the night
