The elephant is dying

Sun is gonna shine
Flowers gonna grow
The clouds will sprinkle showers
The river's gonna flow
Man ain't got the power
To kill nothin' but himself
Man is a creation
Man is nothin' else, oh

We can just jack each other up (Jack each other up)

He got your number, peeped your disease
