I never meant to make you cry
You were the only one I've loved in my life
And though it's hard for me to show it
I've got to let you know it
'Cause darling I love you more each day
But the words got in my way
Ohh, I meant you no harm
And I would die
If you ever said good bye
I love you, I love you
Ohh, I meant you no harm
I never meant to make you cry
You are the only one
I'll ever love in my life
Hold it, hold it
I can't do it
I can't do it no more
I can't sing no more sad songs

Hey Curtis, let's rap with Jimmy Early
Gotta a home in the Hills, Mercedes Benz
Hot swimming Pool, got lots of friends
Got clothes by the acre, credit to spare
I could wake up tomorrow and find nobody there
But Jimmy want more, Jimmy want more
Jimmy want, Jimmy want, Jimmy want more
Jimmy want a rib, Jimmy want a steak
Jimmy want a piece of your chocolate cake
Above all of that Jimmy wants some break
'Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul
Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soul
Sooner or later the time comes around
For a man to be a man and take back his sound
I got to do something to shake things up
I love Johnny Mathis, but I can't do that stuff
Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got S-O-U-L, soul
I can't do rock, I can't do roll
What I can do, baby, is show my soul
'Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul
