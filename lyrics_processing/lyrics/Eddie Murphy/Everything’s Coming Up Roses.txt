'Cause our love is coming on strong
Everything seems to be coming up roses
Strong is our love
Oh, everything seems to be coming up roses
'Cause our love is coming on strong
Yes, everything seems to be coming up roses
Strong is our love
So there we were, two lonely souls
Searching life for that one to make us whole
I look for her, you look for him
Only to find that there was something missing
But like a player when he finds a winning card
I knew you were the one right from the start
Everything seems to be coming up roses
'Cause our love is coming on strong
Everything seems to be coming up roses
Strong is our love
Everything seems to be coming up roses
'Cause our love is coming on strong
Yes, everything seems to be coming up roses
Strong is our love

Ow!
So many times we found ourselves
Wishing to have a love like somebody else
But when we thought that love was right
It seems to fade away into the night
I wanna thank him for the rest of our love
For giving us something we can be sure of
Yes, everything seems to be coming up roses
'Cause our love is coming on strong
Yes, everything seems to be coming up roses
Strong is our love
