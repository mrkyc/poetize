Thirteen years of solid gold platters
Rising cost and cocktail chatter
Fat DJs, stereophonic sound
The game of hits goes 'round and around
But you can fake your way to the top
'Round and around
(spoken)
Try that part right there, baby

'Round and around!

Fake your way to the top

'Round and around!

You fit right in there, didn't you, sweetheart?

You can fake your way to the top
You might also like
'Round and around!

Shit, I knew you'd have it!
(sung)
But it's always real, so real

Always so real

When you're comin' down!
I know what's happenin'

Doo, doot, doo doo

I been around

Doo, doot, doo doo

Fakin' my way
Doo, doot, doo doo

Through every town

Doo, doot, doo doo

I make my livin'

Doo, doot, doo doo

Off of my sound

Doo, doot, doo doo

And the game of hits

Doo, doot, doo doo
Goes 'round and around and around and around

'Round and around and around and around
And 'round and around and around and around
And 'round and around and around and around

Lord, lord
A man gets lonely

Doo, doot, doo doo

Working hard on the road

Doo, doot, doo doo

He's away from his Mama

Doo, doot, doo doo

It's a heavy load

Doo, doot, doo doo

Time to bring up the lights. Yeah, let's see which one of these girls is going home with Jimmy tonight. I got a nice warm bed waiting on you. Alright, now, come on now, who wants to seat on Daddy's lap? Yeah, break it down
(sung)
Fake my way to the top
I gotta fake my way to the top
You know I made my way to the top
Yes, I did
And it's always real, so real

Always so real!

Oh, baby, when you coming down
I made my way
Yes, I did
Help me, help me, Jesus

Help me, Jesus!

Help me, help me, Jesus

Help me, Jesus!
