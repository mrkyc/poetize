Everlastin' romance if that's what you feel
I'm talkin' 'bout a place where every dream is real (Bubble Hill, Bubble Hill)
And every day it rains to wash your cares away
And no one's concerned with if you're straight or gay (Bubble Hill, Bubble Hill)

Live eternal happiness the way you choose
A Bubble-naire'll never have to sing the blues
And nobody's rich and there's nobody broke (On Bubble Hill)
An eternal high that feels like coke and feels like smoke, and all the people say

All the women get shot up with sex appeal, uh
And all the boys have bodies just like stainless steel, yeah (Bubble Hill, Bubble Hill)
A number nine is painted up on every door (On Bubble Hill)
Alarm clock is always set at five past four
Our favorite song's on the hit parades, "The Funky Boogaloo"
It has a perfect beat for all the dances that we do (We like to do it)
And everybody parties 'til the early mornin' light (On Bubble Hill)
Bubble Hill will be surely treat your mothers' children right, and all the people say
