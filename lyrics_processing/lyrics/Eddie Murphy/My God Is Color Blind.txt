With a boy whose eyes were brown, her eyes were blue
Could've had a good love affair but his skin was brown too
And that is something little white girls never do
Because it makes her parents blue
Once upon a time, an orange bus drove through the morning dew
And in the bus were children of assorted hue
Being shipped from the ghetto to a fine white school
But you know the people wouldn't let them through
We don't want no niggers in our school
And my God, ooh, is color blind
Blue, black or white, you can be a friend of mine
And don't ever judge another man by his race or creed
We are all different colors
But if I cut you, you'll bleed
Once upon a time was Martin, Malcolm, John and Bobby
Ooh ooh
They used to travel the country giving hope to a few
And if we band together, they said, there was much we could do
But some people didn't appreciate what they knew
And off the brothers heads they blew
Ooh, my God, ooh, is color blind
Blue, black or white, in your heart just be kind
Yeah, and don't ever judge another man by his race or creed
We are all different colors
But if I cut you, you'll bleed
You might also likeOnce upon a time, the clock stopped ticking, ooh
And the bird in the clock, he said his last cuckoo
Because the Lord was coming to take His chosen few
I know that I am going, baby, how 'bout you?
You see what ignorance can do
My God, ooh, is color blind
Blue, black or white, you can be a friend of mine
And don't ever judge another man by his race or creed
We are all different colors
