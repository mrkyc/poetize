I didn't know what she was frownin' 'bout
I say one, two, three, go!
Hey, people, what'cha frownin' 'bout?
You're alive and I got no doubts
You're playin' records so it's very plain to me
The good Lord shined on down
The breath of life is what I'm talkin' 'bout
Huh, and that alone should make you smile
So raise your hands with me, say
Well, if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout say I (I)
And if you like what I'm talkin' 'bout say, say me (Me)
Understand what I'm talkin' 'bout say, say us (Us)

Jehovah, Buddha, Allah, God
Makes no difference who you are
All I care is that you pray
We're brothers, can't you see?
And we should never frown
'Cause we've got life to cheer about
It's the greatest gift that comes from God
I raise my hands with praise and glee
