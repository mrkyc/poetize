I don't wanna worry you and never wanna make you scream
But I know it's almost over 'cause I read it in a magazine
You know the very thought of it, it makes me wanna cry
They'll shoot some bombs through the sky
Catching a bad one, baby
You can't hide in the mountains, can't run to your limousine, no
Because I've really got the notion that they're gonna get you and me
And the Lord's only gonna take a few up to his side
Now those are real lucky guys
And I know there's not one without a sin
'Cause we all knew one day the party had to end
I really wish that I could tell you when
So drop to your knees and pray now, let's begin to our Lord
You know there's something that somebody should try to do
That's become the head Russian and the U.S. President too
And put a stop to all the talk about the bombs up in the sky
I think we're all gonna fry, yeah
It's a puzzle, baby
