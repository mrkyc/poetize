We don't have to try
To think the same thoughts
We just have a way
Of knowing everything's gonna be okay

We'll laugh 'til we cry
Read each other's minds
Live with a smile
Make it all worthwhile
Make it all worthwhile

Life has moments, hard to describe
Feelin' great and feelin' alive
Never comin' down from this mountain we're on
Always knowin' we're gonna be fine
Feelin' great and feelin' alive
Never coming down from this mountain were on
The feeling's so clear, and it's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride

We don't wanna sleep
Just wanna stay up
There's so much to say
Not enough hours in the day
You might also like
We'll laugh 'til we cry
Read each other's minds
Live with a smile
Make it all worthwhile
Make it all worthwhile

Life has moments, hard to describe
Feelin' great and feelin' alive
Never comin' down from this mountain we're on

Never coming down from this mountain we're on
The feeling's so clear, and it's crazy up here

(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
No time to be lazy
The journey is perfect
The place is so crazy
The race is so worth it
I will be with you
We'll do this together
Always together
Life has moments, hard to describe
Feelin' great and feelin' alive
Never coming dow' from this mountain we're on (Mountain we're on)
Always knowin' we're gonna be fine
Feelin' great and feelin' alive
Never comin' down from this
Never comin' down, never comin' down
Never comin' down (From this)
