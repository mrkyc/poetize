I used to think maybe you love me
Now baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait 'til the day when you knock on my door, yeah
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me, you're comin' around

I used to think maybe you love me
I know that it's true
And I don't wanna spend all of my life just waitin' for you
Just waitin' for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day
No, no, no
I said, "Baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
