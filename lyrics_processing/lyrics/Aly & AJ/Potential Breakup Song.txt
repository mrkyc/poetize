La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

It took too long, it took too long, it took too long
For you to call back
And normally, I would just forget that
Except for the fact it was my birthday, my stupid birthday
I played along, I played along, I played along
Rolled right off my back
But obviously, my armor was cracked
What kind of a boyfriend would forget that?
Who would forget that?

The type of guy who doesn't see
What he has until she leaves
Don't let me go
'Cause without me, you know you're lost
Wise up now or pay the cost
Soon you will know

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me

This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh, baby, please, please tell me

We got along, we got along, we got along
Until you did that
Now all I want is just my stuff back
Do you get that?
Let me repeat that
I want my stuff back

You can send it in a box
I don't care, just drop it off
I won't be home
'Cause without me, you know you're lost
Minus you, I'm better off
Soon you will know

You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin'
Winnin' me
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin'
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me
You can try, you can try
You know I know it'd be a lie
Without me, you're gonna die
So you better think clearly, clearly
Before you nearly, nearly mess up
The situation that you're gonna miss dearly, dearly, c'mon

You're not livin' 'til you're livin' (No)
Livin' with me
You're not winnin' 'til you're winnin' (No, no, no, no)
Winnin' me, yeah, yeah
You're not gettin' 'til you're gettin' ('Til you're gettin')
Gettin' me
You're not livin' 'til you're livin'
Livin' for me (No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no)

This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh, baby, please, please tell me
This is the potential make up song
Please just admit you're wrong
Which will it be?
Which will it be?
