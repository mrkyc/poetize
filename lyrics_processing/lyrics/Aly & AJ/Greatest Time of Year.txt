It's the greatest time of year
And it's here, help me celebrate it
With everybody here
Friends so dear, let me simply state it
It's our favorite way
To spend the holiday, yeah

There's a special kind of feeling in the air
It only happens at this time of year
When everyone is filled with love and cheer
That's what matters
Pretty paper boxes tied with bows
Walking in the sun or in the snow
We can feel the excitement
Growing, knowing

It's the greatest time of year
And it's here, help me celebrate it
With everybody here
Friends so dear, let me simply state it
Joy to the world and everyone
Lift up your hearts and feel the love
It's our favorite way
To spend the holiday, yeah
You might also like
We can get all cozy by the fire
Turn the music up a little higher
I don't think that I could ever tire
Of being together
Decorate the tree
Hang mistletoe and stand by me
It's a picture perfect moment captured
Memories that we'll have after

It's the greatest time of year
And it's here, help me celebrate it
With everybody here
Friends so dear, let me simply state it
Joy to the world and everyone
Lift up your hearts and feel the love
It's our favorite way
To spend the holiday, yeah

Spend the holidays, hey, yeah, yeah
It's the greatest time

Greatest time of year
Time to celebrate
Now it's our favorite time
It's the greatest time of year
And it's here, help me celebrate it
With everybody here
Friends so dear, let me simply state it
Joy to the world, joy to the world, joy to the world
It's the greatest time of year
It's the greatest time
It's the greatest time of year
And it's here, help me celebrate it
