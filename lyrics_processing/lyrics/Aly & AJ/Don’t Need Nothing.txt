When you sleep through your alarm
Nothing is further from your mind
Even your hopes and dreams don't bother, don't bother
So don't lose your pace, don't fall behind

A touch of the beat
Gets you up on your feet
Gets you out and then into the sun
A touch of the beat
Gets you out and then into the sun
A touch of the beat
Gets you up on your feet
Gets you out and then into the sun
A touch of the beat
Gets you out and then into the sun

You know the devil's never far behind
But he isn't welcome here so don't bother, don't bother

A touch of the beat
Gets you up on your feet (I don't need nothing at all)
Gets you out and then into the sun
A touch of the beat
Gets you out and then into the sun (I don't need nothing at all)
A touch of the beat
Gets you up on your feet (I don't need nothing at all)
Gets you out and then into the sun
A touch of the beat
Gets you out and then into the sun (I don't need nothing at all)

Don't need nothing, I don't need nothing
Don't need nothing, I don't need nothing
Don't need nothing, I don't need nothing
Don't need nothing, I don't need nothing (I'm over turning over, I'm over)
Don't need nothing, I don't need nothing (I'm over turning over)
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
