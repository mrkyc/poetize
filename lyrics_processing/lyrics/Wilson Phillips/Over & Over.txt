Lonely one, lonely one
Oh, baby
Hey, we're fallin' like the rain
From the sky
(Don't know why)
I thought that things would change
But in the real world you make it so hard
I've lost my faith in the stars
And my heart keeps on breakin'
Over, and over, and over again
My heart is breakin'
Over, and over, and over again
Hey, we're movin' like the sea
(Can you take me, can you take me?)
Where I wanna be
(Where I wanna be)
It's clearer than water
My love can't be stronger
And no one's better for me
But in the real world you make it so hard
I've lost my faith in the stars
'Cause my heart keeps on breakin'
Over, and over, and over again
My heart is breakin'
Over, and over, and over again
Every time you leave me, I just can't believe it
Tell me why it's so hard to give you up, over and over
Every time I tried, it hurt more inside
I should've known from the start
Tell me why, it's so hard, hard
Lonely one, lonely one
Lonely one, lonely one
Please don't leave me
My heart would be then such a lonely one
(I think it's time this time)
(Don't ever leave me)
Please don't leave me
My heart would be such a lonely one
(I think it's time this time)
Oh, baby, I've gotta give you up
But I don't wanna let you go
(I think it's time this time)
Please don't leave me
My heart would be such a lonely one
(I think it's time this time)
I don't, don't wanna believe that it's over
(I think it's time this time)
Don't ever leave me, oh my heart
The fire keeps on dying in the end
I think it's time this time
(Hearts keep breakin')
