'Cause I'm wise to your disguise
I've seen you love me with your eyes
Even if you think I'm a fool and I just can't tell
Then you don't know me well
Won't you come over here and break the ice?
It would be so nice
It's what you want when you're around me
You're a little bit shy and I feel the need
And I can tell that you're happy you found me
(Just give it up)
Why wait around when you know what you're feeling?
(Give it up)
I look through your eyes I can see that you want somebody
(Give it up)
It could feel so good to get into it
Give it up, give it up, you want it baby
Give it up, give it up, you know you got me
Come on, come on, come on and give it up
I can't, I can't lie to you
Now we can all tell stories so come over here and love me
Even if you think I'm a fool and I just can't tell
Sorry I know you well and I know you will
Come over here and love me
It's what you want when you're around me
You're a little bit shy and I feel the need
And I can tell that you're happy you found me
(Just give it up)
Why wait around when you know what you're feeling?
(Give it up)
I look through your eyes I can see that you want somebody
(Give it up)
It could feel so good to get into it
Give it up, give it up, you want it baby
Give it up, give it up, you know you got me
Come on, come on, come on and give it up
