You're never gonna get well
I understand your reasons not to
What you don't know is what you're afraid of
And I'm afraid of it too
But can I even talk to you again?
Oh, part of me wants to call you up and talk to you like a friend
And there's a part of me that wants to shut you out
And never see your face again
How can we be like enemies when we're only flesh and blood?
What does it take to make your heart bleed?
Daddy, aren't we enough?
You can get through, there's nothing stopping you from getting to us
No one can take away the fact that we're only flesh and blood
For years I've been following your case
It's the only time I see your face
And we've learned to live without you
Who you don't know is who you're afraid of
And we're afraid of you too
But will we ever talk to you again?
Oh, part of me wants to call you up, just talk to you like a friend
There's a part of me that wants to shut you out
And never see your face again
How can we be like enemies when we're only flesh and blood?
What does it take to make your heart bleed?
Daddy, aren't we enough?
You can get through, there's nothing stopping you from getting to us
Nothing can take away the fact that we're only, oh no, no flesh and blood
Want to make you laugh and I want a chance to know you better
I want to hear you sing beside me now
We're just like you
How can we be like enemies when we're only flesh and blood?
And what does it take to make your heart bleed?
Daddy, aren't we enough?
Oh, you can get through, there's no one stopping you from getting to us
No one can take away the fact that we're only flesh and blood
I want to make you laugh, I want a chance to know you better
I want to hear you sing beside me now
Flesh and blood
I want to make you laugh, I want a chance to know you better
I want to hear you sing beside me now
Flesh and blood
I want to make you laugh, I want a chance to know you better
I want to hear you sing beside me now
I'm a part of you and I miss you
