You wore your mysterious cloak just like a child
No careless words were said, we spoke with eyes instead
We looked into each other like long lost friends
Then you went away and I never heard, you had a summer haunt
You said, "The ice would kill but you would not be caught"
We have eyes like twins
Where your last thought ends my next begins always
Just one heartbeat away
From everything I mean to say, oh
Catch me I'm falling like you
Wish for me I'll come running to save you
Touch me, I'm calling for you
Remember me, I will never betray you
We have eyes like twins
(We have eyes like twins)
We have eyes like twins
I slept a thousand hours, my heart felt cold as a coward's
You sent a southern breeze like forest fire
I heard those voices too, I dreamed each dream with you
We breathe as one together and shed our tears
But then I woke with you and my dream came true
I'll never hold you here I know when winter comes that you will disappear
We have eyes like twins
Where your last thought ends my next begins always
Just one heartbeat away
From everything I mean to say, oh
Catch me I'm falling like you
(Falling like you)
Wish for me I'll come running to save you
(Save you)
Touch me, I'm calling for you
Remember me, I will never betray you
We have eyes like twins
(We have eyes like twins)
We have eyes like twins
I see red
(I see red)
When you're in danger
And I see blue
(I see blue)
When you are crying
All the pictures I believe
(I believe)
You are no stranger
You are no stranger
We have eyes like twins
Where your last thought ends my next begins always
Just one heartbeat away
From everything I mean to say, oh
Catch me I'm falling like you
Wish for me I'll come running to save you
(I'll save you)
Touch me, I'm calling for you
Remember me, I will never betray you
We have eyes like twins
(We have eyes like twins)
We have eyes like twins
Catch me I'm falling for you
Remember me, you are no stranger
We have eyes like twins
You are no stranger to me
(We have eyes like twins)
