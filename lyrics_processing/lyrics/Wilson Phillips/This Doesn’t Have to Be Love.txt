Softly, love is standing here with its demands
Tell me what you want from me, you want from me, you want from me
Slowly, I think I'm letting go of all my plans
Tell me where we're going to, we're going to
But why, why am I afraid to give into this, why am I afraid?

This doesn't have to be love
But it's all I can feel, it's all that I fear
This doesn't have to be anything at all
It's so hard to fall from this high above
But do we have to call it love?

I hold back from everything I really want to say
Should I let my guards down, my guards down, my guards down
I don't, I don't make commitments that could break
Maybe it's just too late, it's just too late
And I, I'm so afraid to give into this, I'm so afraid, oh

This doesn't have to be love
But it's all I can feel, it's all that I fear
This doesn't have to be anything at all
It's so hard to fall from this high above
So, do we have to call it love?
You might also like
I need a little time to think things out, baby
Do I really want to give myself, give all myself to you, now?
I can't believe it's happening so fast
'Cause I don't want to bring back what I left in the past, no

This doesn't have to be love
But it's all I can feel, it's all that I fear
It doesn't have to be anything at all
It's so hard to fall from this high above
Now this doesn't have to be love

Love, it's so hard to fall in love
This doesn't have to be love
Love, love me, love, love me
So hard to fall, so very hard to fall
