That's what you are to me
You make me feel alive, and I wanna be
By your side
You're alright
And how I found you honey I'll never know
(Don't know)
But you're part of me, won't let you go
I would never, never hurt you
So let me be the one to tell you, uh-huh
I could go on and on and on and on forever
I need you to know
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
My evening sun
You warm every part of me
You make me feel alive, are you gonna be
By my side?
'Cause you're alright
And how I found you honey I'll never know
But you're part of me, won't let you go
I would never, never hurt you
I will be the one to tell you, uh-huh
I could go on and on and on and on forever
I need you to know
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
I don't care what they say
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
Doesn't matter anyway
Just like the sun, your love always surrounds me
Don't go down, don't go away without me
There's a lot of talk and speculation about our situation
But when it comes to how I feel about you
I don't need any help I'll tell you myself
All I need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
All I need you to know
(Need you to know)
All I need you to know
(Need you to know)
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
I don't care what they say
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
Doesn't matter anyway
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
(Need you to know)
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
(Need you to know)
All I really need you to know
Is ooh you're gold
All I really need you to know
