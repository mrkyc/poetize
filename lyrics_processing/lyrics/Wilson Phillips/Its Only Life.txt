Do you?
Come on, play it! Wooh
Are you awake?
Have you anything to say?
Are you aware of what surrounds you?
And all the times you tried to please everyone
Can you admit it doesn't matter?
Ooh there's never a dull moment in my life
And I don't mind the ride
I don't mind the ride, yes
So listen
Don't live a lifeless life
When you could be living it right
Don't be one to be led, ahah
It's a heavy world in my small world
Get up get out of bed
Ooh there's never a dull moment in my life
And I don't mind the ride
Don't you know it's only life
It's only life
Taking you on a constant flight
Don't you know that it's only life
There is no wrong there could be no right
Whatever you're doing
However you're doing it
You'll be living your life
Yes it's only life
So there is no wrong, no right
Ooh it's a constant flight
A constant flight
Movin' on
Are you awake?
I don't think I have the answer
Is there no one on the other line?
No
Now it's a heavy world in my small world
But I'm feeling just fine
Ooh there's never a still moment in my life
And I don't mind the ride
Don't you know it's only life
It's only life
Taking you on a constant flight
Don't you know that it's only life
There is no wrong there could be no right
Whatever you're doing
However you're doing it
You'll be living your life
Yes it's only life
So there is no wrong, no right
Ooh it's a constant flight
A constant flight
Life
Don't you know
Crying
It's only life, it's only life
Don't you know
Crying
It's only life, it's only life
I'm crying
Don't you know it's only life
Taking you on a constant flight
Don't you know that it's only life
There is no wrong there could be no right
Whatever you're doin'
However you're doing it
You'll be living your life
Don't you know it's only life
And everyone pushes to get by
We go here
We're going there
Somebody tell me why
Don't you know that it's only life
There is no wrong
There could be no right
Whatever you're doing
However you're doing
You'll be living your life
Don't you know it's only life
Don't you know it's only life
Don't you know
