Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'this could be heaven and this could be hell'
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
There's plenty of room at the hotel california
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find us here
Her mind is tiffany-twisted
She got the mercedes benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
You might also likeSo I called up the captain
'please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
Welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
We're livin' it up at the hotel california
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said
'we are all just prisoners here of our own device'
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'relax, 'said the night man
We are programmed to receive
And you can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave!
So welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
We're living it up at the hotel california
Any time of year (any time of year)
