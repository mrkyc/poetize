At night crisp white on white two steps on
Shorty-wop you can take two steps tall
Pause don't step on my new Air Jordans
I see you like to model well I'll dance on that
I don't tap I can do the Kid n Play on that
School crab and walk with a baseball bat
New Edition does it fresh with the Cabbage Patch
Patch on my jacket mean the leader of the pack
Pack a lunch, snack chips, ham sandwich of the bunch
Country hall in the back with my cap to the back
Back to the back of the class for you crabs
Shrimps, lobsters, sharks, crawfish
Mean fastball you can't get a hit off us
Outfield n*ggaz wanna run up on us
Mush mouth you might want to be more cautious
Awesome (awesome)
We rockin, we toss 'em (toss 'em)
Word, flossin (flossin)
Awesome (awesome)(uh)
We rockin, we toss 'em (uh uh)

Spill a little on the counter when I'm fillin it up
Drill drill procedures just follow chill
Will you get me a cup from there
But spare me the Tupperware
Hard to get a toast with that plastic sh*t
I sit in the chair in the crip hey why be bissel why be
Chisel why cutten my head playing n*ggers f**king the sh*t
Being 18 mean they gonna be ruffing their head
We all down but ain't nobody ducking their head
In downtown dog catcher everybody like Mike
Hanging like a comic, or Mr. Cooper, super califragilistic
Listen a Southern playa lynched it
Graduated from district 2 2 7, reppin the south subs
Don't nobody show it enough love
It fits like a glove and, leave it alone
I can't get the keys to the crib walking her home
