So I'm singing this song about you, escaping this life
She wake up early, facing the mirror and sings all my songs that she likes
She know my life, she'll back it, rush, in love with the mode and the bike
I feel the same about you, ain't nothing gonna change about you
I can't go forth without you, just be by my side
Beverly Hills is still here, Cherries and Plums is still here
The world has the magic powers to turn into forces, my gorgeous
This is what all the girls around the world are searching for
They are a thing to be honeyed up, sweetest than the sweetest love
Girl, you're the blue, blue symphony
This is what all the girls around the world pray for
Their prince charming, beauty love, love anyone else
Look at the bikes go past, hearing the wind, curling their back
It must be your Amsterdam 'cause the nicest of them is just filled with the past
Beautiful parks, wonderful art, I've been searching for you
What a wonderful start
It's all a start, thinking the hips, black, long, colorful chicks
You should pride the thoughts in here, say goodbye, she always will
We go walking, have nothing to fear, fireworks in the air
Tell her wait, disappear, this a reason to celebrate, babe
This a reason to celebrate, babe
This is what all the girls around the world are searching for
They are a thing to be honeyed up, sweetest than the sweetest love
Girl, you're the blue, blue symphony
This is what all the girls around the world pray for
Their prince charming, beauty love, love anyone else
