Oh, oh
When you're down on nothing, and you cannot see the end
When you're down on nothing, you cannot find your friends
Bring 'em in
Tell me where you're hiding out
Missing when I need you now
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Spent too long with the lights out
To flip that switch again
Said I spent too long with the lights out
Wondering where you've been
Said I spent too long with the lights out
Too long with the lights out
Too long, too long, too long

And now I glow (In the dark)
And now I glow (In the dark, in the dark)
And now I glow (In the dark)
And now I glow, oh, oh (In the dark, in the dark)

When you're hotter than burning
A drop will fill your cup
When you're harder for loving
Down it seems like her
Wishing that heaven would shine on me
Shine down and set me free
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
I spent too long in the shadows to hide my life from you
I spent too long in the shadows
But now I know the truth
I spent too long in the shadows
Too long in the shadows
Too long, too long, too long
You might also like
And now I glow (In the dark)
And now I glow (In the dark, in the dark)
And now I glow (In the dark)
And now I glow, oh, oh (In the dark, in the dark)
And now I glow (In the dark)
And now I glow (In the dark, in the dark)
And now I glow (In the dark)
And now I glow, oh, oh (In the dark, in the dark)

In the dark
I glow
In the dark, in the dark
And now I glow
In the dark, in the dark
And now I glow
In the dark, in the dark
And now I glow
In the dark, in the dark
And now I glow, I glow, I glow
