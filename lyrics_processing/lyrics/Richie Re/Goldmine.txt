It's Richie

Come on, daddy, let me put it on you one time
Come on, daddy, come and put it in me one time
Come on, daddy, I ain't tryna waste no time
Ah, ah
Skrrt, skrrt, I might bump into it one time
Don't hold back, baby, when it's your time
Picture perfect, think I found me a goldmine
Like I'm surfing when I slide in it, oh my

Pussy tight, head right (Head right), I be driving him wild (Wild)
Gang shit, it's on sight (It's on sight), I be putting it down
I'm fuckin' him when he ask me, the sex drive fast speed
I need a bad boy like Cassie, fucking him on the backseat
He give me good head, good head, that relax me
I put this mouth on him, now he yelling out Richie Re
Baddest in the game, that's why he fuck with me
He slipped the rubber off and now he know he stuck with me
Every time I call his phone, I tell him no company
I'm the right to his wrong, he got me hooked luckily

Come on, daddy, let me put it on you one time
Come on, daddy, come and put it in me one time
Come on, daddy, I ain't tryna waste no time
Ah, ah
Skrrt, skrrt, I might bump into it one time
Don't hold back, baby, when it's your time
Picture perfect, think I found me a goldmine
Like I'm surfing when I slide in it, oh my

Hood, but I'm passionate, I'm trying to give you all me
Know I'm pulling up, I'm doing the dash when you call me
Pussy fat like a catcher's mitt, I'm all in it balls deep
Gone for the season, I got all these bitches salty
Richie Re, can I be your one and only?
Sex you to some Lauryn Hill, love you softly
You so real, your appeal got me concrete
If that pussy good, I might just give you my offspring
Girl, get nasty, fuck me ratchet, I'm asking
No attachment, from the floor to the mattress
Marilyn Manson, kill it, put it in a casket
Beat that pussy drastic, I love it when she ask me

Come on, daddy, let me put it on you one time
Come on, daddy, come and put it in me one time
Come on, daddy, I ain't tryna waste no time
