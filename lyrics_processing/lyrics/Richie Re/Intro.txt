(T. Lewis a fool)
That's real shit

Every day, I'm tryna be the best version of myself
Tryna outdo my past, told my mama I can't do it all myself (I can't)
Tryna juggle my career, keepin' secrets from the public
Everybody in my ear, it don't help (Shut up)
My family havin' high hopes (Hah)
It's like I'm walkin' on a tightrope
Blind and I can't miss a step (I can't miss a step)
I just want the belt like the champ
I'm blessed and I ain't never had to stress over stamps (Nah)
A mess when they had me sittin' dressed in the cell (Damn)
I cried when they told me I was blessed with a bail (Ah)
I came home, nigga still cheatin' on me
Sold everything, can't believe you cheated on me (The fuck? Damn)
Know you was wrong when you did it
Hate to admit it
But damn, I ain't get a visit (I didn't)
So now I gotta pivot like Shaq on the post (Post)
Told you I was with you on that day I took that oath (Oath)
Now it's all Gucci, I ain't never doin' Coach (Nah)
Trill-ass bitch poppin' bottles on a boat (Trill bitch)
If I'm with a nigga, we ain't never goin' broke (Never)
If we talkin' bread, then I want the whole loaf (I want the whole loaf)
If I'ma kiss a bitch, she gotta be a DeJ Loaf (Loaf)
'Cause a rich bitch never get impressed by the broke (Nope)
And I miss Flint, but I couldn't blow in that zone (No)
Sometimes you gotta leave your comfort zone just to blow (Had to go)
And if they don't believe in you, just let 'em (Let 'em)
Believe what they want, but your wings, you gotta spread 'em (Gotta spread 'em)
They won't get it 'til you pull up in that brand new
Then you change your number, they gon' swear you actin' brand new
Fuck it, I don't give a shit, told 'em I'm a rich bitch
The ones that think I owe somethin', they ain't never did shit (They ain't did shit)
All they ever do is come up to me with they hand out (With they hand out)
Hatin' on me, they ain't understand it's God's plans now, hmm
Hatin' on me, they ain't understand it's God's plans now
'Member when I used to work them jobs, nine-to-fivin'
They was all laughin', I was just survivin'
They ain't all believe it, now they all silent (Woo, woo)
Now I'm overseas shootin' videos in Thailand (Yeah)
Diamonds after diamonds, I just hate that gotta blind 'em (Blind)
Hits after hits, Billboard, watch me pile 'em (Brr)
Fans goin' crazy, tig ol' bitties, watch me sign 'em (Ooh)
Do it for my city, every day, I'm gon' remind 'em
When you dream chasin' and you never stop (Never stop)
And you keep God first, you can get a lot (Get a lot)
If you keep goin' hard, you can make it out (Keep goin')
Stay real to yourself what it's all about (Yeah)
This for my independent bitches who don't want shit (Independent)
Ain't chasin' no nigga, got your own shit (Got your own shit)
Fuck the top floor, bitch, we want the building (Building)
And we be catchin' flights, not feelings, yeah (Not feelings)
