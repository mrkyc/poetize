Could ever stop my baby
Nothing you could say
Could tear us two apart
We've got all the spark
To set this place on fire
We got making love
Right down to a fine art
Nothing you could do
Could ever stop this feeling
Nothing in the world
Could ever shake us up
We've got all the stuff to
Break all of the rules, yeah
We've got all the stuff
To mess all of you up
We got a mad, mad love
We got a mad, mad love
We got a really, really, really
Really, really, really, really
Mad love
Nothing you could do
Could ever stop this burning
Nothing you could say
Could ever stop this fire
Tell me I'm a fool
For everything that we do
Tell me we're a mess
And I'll tell you you're a liar
