Play me down, my lover
Like we're undercover
Like we're in our freshmen year
Like all the girls and boys in school
Our anticipation
And our bad behaving
It's like we learned our lesson
But conveniently forgot the rules

Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that?

I don't want your lover
Like my younger brother
He's patronized another
But I think it's serious this time
I don't want you fading
Acting like you hate me
It's just like all your paper cuts
That cut you in the coldest spots
You might also like

Fuck all the rest
And forget the rules

(Keep playing along again!)
