I've been searching for days now
I've found something I lost
On a Holy Roller channel asking me what's the cost
On a couch in a cold room
Pouring salt in my wounds
I'm a mistake faking truth holding liars' balloons
Oh, make me fly for something more

You've been asleep for days now
Living inside your dreams
You know that ain't no way to live or to handle such things
I wanna shake up your system
I wanna rattle your bones
I wanna take you to the stars and then I'll leave you alone

Oh, I would meet you anywhere but I've been
Farther down, I saw you somewhere
Farther down, than I expected
Now I'm overcome with fear
Mama get me out of here
I've gone farther down than I ever wanna go

Burning up the horizon
To the city skyline
In a faded aspiration only left in our minds
Let us shake up the system
Let's go and rattle their frames
Let's take the highest road away and avoid these trappings
You might also like
Oh, I would meet you anywhere but I've been
Farther down, I saw you somewhere
Farther down, than I expected
Now I'm overcome with fear
Mama get me out of here
I've gone farther down than I ever wanna go

We stood out in the cold
And your eyes, they ate my soul
Beg me to come back down
They beg me to come back down
Then the ground ate my legs
So I looked up the sky and said
"I don't want to go back down
Oh, I've been so far down"
Heaven help me, heaven help me, for the way I've been

Farther down, than I expected
Now I'm overcome with fear
Mama get me out of here
I've gone farther down than I ever, than I ever wanna go
Farther down, I saw you somewhere
Farther down, than I expected
Now I'm overcome with fear, oh oh-oh
