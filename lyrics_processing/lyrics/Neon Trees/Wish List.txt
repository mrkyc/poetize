I've had a fire burning
Since the holidays began
I hear its cold out where you're living
But it ain't colder than I've been
I've been an animal since you left me
I need you wrapped under my tree
My Christmas cheer is here and ready
But where are you to set it free

I sit alone
By the fire inside our home
Outside the snow is falling
And I'm singing

Wish as I may, wish as I might
Grant me this one small wish
On Christmas night
'Cause I don't need candy
Or the toys from my youth
I just want you, oh darling, I just want you

I've had a candle burning
Hoping you'll come back to me
I think this may be more than anything
Mr. Santa Claus can bring
I was adorable when you left me
I'm on the naughty list this year
A lump of coal won't do it justice
It's all the loneliness I fear
You might also like
I sit alone
By the gifts in our own home
You're not a single one
And now I'm singing

Wish as I may, wish as I might
Grant me this one small wish
On Christmas night
'Cause I don't need candy
Or the toys from my youth
I just want you, oh darling, I just want you

I'm not Grinch
I'm not Mr. Scrooge
My heart just needs your light
The only thing I'm doing
Is crying in my room and singing
I wish my baby would be with me
Tonight
Oh oo oh oo oh oo oh
Oh I've been so lonely
Wish as I may, wish as I might
Grant me this one small wish
On Christmas night
'Cause I don't need candy
Or the toys from my youth
I just want you, oh darling, I just want you
Oh oh oh
I just want you, oh darling, I just want you
Oh oo oh
