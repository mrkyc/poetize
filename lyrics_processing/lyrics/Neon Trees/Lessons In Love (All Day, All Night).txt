When you walk my way
I feel a rush come over me
A sharp panic panic
It's the things you say
That makes a rush come over me
It happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules (na na)
I'm better just pretending I was the fool

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love

If I walk away
I feel a push inside of me
That won't let me leave
But what could I say
For you to feel what's inside of me
This happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules (na na)
I'm better just pretending I was the fool (hear me out)

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love
I'm only lonely when the lights are on
I want the same rush over and over and over and over and over
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
Come on!
Whoa!

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love
