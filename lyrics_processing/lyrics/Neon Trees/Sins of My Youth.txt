I've got these habits that I cannot
I've got these habits that I can't
I've got these habits that I cannot break

I found life out on the weekdays
When we would drive to some new city
Call me crazy, I was born to make a mess
Would you love me still if I were to confess

That I had a little too much fun
Back when I was young?

I've got these habits that I cannot break
And as I'm older there is more at stake
Go ahead and call me fake
But these are the sins, the sins of my youth
I break habits just to fall in love
But I do it on designer drugs
You can call me dangerous
But these are the sins, the sins of my youth

All these mainstream made emotions
Made me the boy that they wanted me to be
But when I took down my defenses
For the first time there was something in me
Yeah, something in me
You might also like
Hot like a smoking gun
Back when I was young

I've got these habits that I cannot break
And as I'm older there is more at stake
Go ahead and call me fake
But these are the sins, the sins of my youth
I break habits just to fall in love
But I do it on designer drugs
You can call me dangerous
But these are, these are
Would you love me still?
Would you love me still?
Would you love me still?
Would you love?

I've got these habits that I cannot break
And as I'm older there is more at stake
Go ahead and call me fake
But these are the sins, the sins of my youth
I break habits just to fall in love
But I do it on designer drugs
You can call me dangerous
But these are, these are
Would you love me still?
(I've got these habits that I cannot)
Would you love me still?
(I've got these habits that I cannot)
Would you love me still?
(I've got these habits that I cannot)
Would you love?
Would you love me still?
(I've got these habits that I cannot)
Would you love me still?
(I've got these habits that I cannot)
Would you love me still?
