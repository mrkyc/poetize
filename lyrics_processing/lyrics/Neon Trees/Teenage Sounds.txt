I'm sick of living under everybody's shadow
I'm sick of everyone's success, I know that's shallow
I'm sick of hearing people lie to get by, to get by
I'm sick of people that can't look me in the eye all the time
I'm tired of girls
I'm tired of boys
I'm tired of nonsense
I'm t-t-t-t-t-t-tired of the process
I'm sick and tired of always feeling second best
I'm tired of never ever making any progress

To all the cool kids on my block
Where's the original thought, tell me?
Oh yeah you never heard us
Don't ever try to turn us down
We're making all the noise
We're making teenage sounds
It's the same old song and dance
We're sick of everybody trying to be famous

I'm sick of always operating out of fear
I'm sick of being called a fag because I'm queer
I'm sick of everybody saying to be happy (laughs)
I'm positive that I'm allowed to have a bad day
I'm tired of everybody trying to be a DJ

I'm sick of people saying Rock n Roll is dead
Learn how to play guitar and save yourself instead

To all the cool kids on my block
Where's the original thought, tell me?
Oh yeah you never heard us
Don't ever try to turn us down
We're making all the noise
We're making teenage sounds
It's the same old song and dance
We're sick of everybody trying to be famous

The truth is hard to swallow when it's true
The truth is hard to swallow when it's choking you
The truth is hard to swallow when it's true
The truth is hard to swallow when it's choking you

Oh yeah you never heard us
Don't ever try to turn us down
We're making all the noise
We're making teenage sounds
It's the same old song and dance
We're sick of everybody trying to be famous
