She really had me turnin' on
I fought for hours just to try and speak
Tell my babe I was the only one
Don't you know how it feels
To live days and months and years
Trapped inside a waking dream
I betcha you and I could step out tonight and try
To make it more than just a fantasy
We are fast youth going nowhere
Burning this town like we don't care
Nothing you say could ever put out our fire
We can pretend, pretend for the weekend
We can pretend, pretend for the weekend
Outside, the night's as young as us
Tonight is just the two of us
Pretend, pretend for the weekend
I found my love, it was just last week
She was smooth with her heart glasses on
I felt the fire, fire was in my feet
Let's be together now while we're still young
Baby don't you know how it feels
To live days and months and years
Trapped inside a waking dream
I betcha you and I could step out tonight and try
To make it more than just a fantasy

We can pretend, pretend for the weekend
We can pretend, pretend for the weekend
Outside, the night's as young as us
Tonight it's just the two of us
Pretend, pretend for the weekend
We are the ones that put on the show
I am the one that never let go
I'm never alone when I'm around you, around you
We can pretend, pretend for the weekend
We can pretend, pretend for the weekend
