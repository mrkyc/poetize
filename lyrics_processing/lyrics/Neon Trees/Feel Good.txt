I was born naked just like every other kid
I grew up scared to death
I'd never quite fit in
Then I met you, it was golden
I was drinking way too much
But what else is there to do when everything around you sucks
Come on, come on

Hands up, touch the sky
Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
Yeah the truth is, honey, I just wanna feel good

Oh, I'm tired of waking up alone
I just wanna feel good, feel, feel good
Stay, you and me, we can dance the night away
I wanna make you feel good, feel, feel good

Yeah, you were naked in my dream I had last night
Then things got wet and weird
And I woke up all paralyzed
I was shaken
I was nervous
Yeah, I'm way too old for this
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But it's us you're gonna miss
Come on, come on
You might also like
Hands up, touch the sky
Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
Yeah the truth is, honey, I just wanna feel good

Oh, I'm tired of waking up alone
I just wanna feel good, feel, feel good
Stay, you and me, we can dance the night away
I wanna make you feel good, feel, feel good

Yeah, I'm anxious
A little depressed
Why do we make things so complicated?
Yeah, are you anxious?
A little depressed?
Let's feel good again, feel good again

Oh, I'm tired of waking up alone
I just wanna feel good, feel, feel good
Stay, you and me, we can dance the night away
I wanna make you feel good, feel, feel good
Hands up, touch the sky
Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
