Oh mi Lord, be my shield
I ask of Thee
I know they still have some evil purpose in mind, hahaha
Wanna hurt me...
Oh yes
Cho!

I'm not sure if I will live to see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work is taking off like an arrow
I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And wicked people work is taking off...

I'm not afraid to die, but 'fraid to live until death
It's not hard for you to guess what will happen next
Heartaches and pain, works of ungodliness
Some no know why dem a live, that's when dem have to hurt the flesh
But, who are they? Tell me what they represent
I struggle with fear as I experience
How dem do dem dirty works to which Jah, He resent
And no one, but dem, ago face the consequence
They've build walls instead of bridges, it's ridicule
Then war with whom they live, like a fool
But if I trod the wrong road, away I want to pull
Because the vessel of the iniquity never yet full
Cho...

I wonder if I will live to see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And wicked people work is taking off like an arrow
I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And wicked people work is taking off, oh yes

That burning concern is no longer there
They're filled with the medicine weh Babylon prepare
Instruments of cruelty present everywhere
Strong enough to take the life, but not enough to care
As the road gets dark I expect anything
I know not my enemies, so it leave me wondering
Many life was lost, who is the next victim?
It could be you, it could be I to how dem set the system
Dem kill without a cause, what is the meaning?
Cho...
No one knows what tomorrow may bring

I'm not sure if I will live to see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work is taking off like an arrow
I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work is taking off...
Oh Lord, they are filled with corruption and selfishness
Overload with bitterness and wrath
So I have to seek to keep myself away from the wicked on the roads they walk
Oh yes, dem sow seeds of conflict
Dem waan fi see me trip
But that nah go fester my heart
Because I dwell inna Jah sight
And do what is right
Don't want it to be said that I never play my part
I deride with enemies and I am my brother's keeper
What have I done? Dem no waan fi see me prosper
Push on this load as they make it heavier
Jah! It's only sorrow the wicked have to offer

I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of...world of...
Cho!
