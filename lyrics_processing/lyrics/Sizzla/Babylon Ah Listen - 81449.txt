Babylon ah listen from near and far
Don't even go ask them what dem peepin for
Tell them they can't hold the youths
With no more house and car
Hear we Ethiopia, or ah this ah war
Babylon ah listen from near and far
Don't even go ask them what them searching for
Tell them they can't hold the youths
With no more house and car
Give we Ethiopia, yo haffi black star

Babylon ah listen and devise new plan
Dangerous sitting we they ah so too long
Blackness risen so arise black man
Black woman teeth ah glisten... Ethiopian

Unno free up every prison or a revolution
