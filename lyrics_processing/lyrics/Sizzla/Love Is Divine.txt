Take these words of divine
To the princess right away
Tell her to be fine
I don't want her to stray
Words of divine
To the empress right away
Tell her to be mine
I don't want her to stray
Knowin your portion, who knows your motion
Joyful will I be in your eyes
Put-a put away pollution, sabbatical strong
Royalty belongs to my side
Let us care for the younger ones
The children our tongue
Nature grows and prove you're qualified
To know and overstand no segregation
That is not the works of the wise
(CHORUS:)
Words of divine
To the princess right away
Tell her to be fine
Never go astray
Words of divine
To all the woman right away
Put Selassie pun uno mind
Never go astray

Oh oh, Oh woman of the isles in strife
That's what I behold in my sight

Oh what family you fright
Bless her down with faith, take this to her gate
With love before the falling of the night
(CHORUS:)

The whole of uno come from the heap
