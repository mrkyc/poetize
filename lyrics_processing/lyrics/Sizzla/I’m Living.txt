I'm Living
I I I I, ii-i-i-i, Emperor Selassie I (Jah)

I'm living for the sick and the poor
The hungry and the shelterless sleeping on the floor
I'm giving all I've got and more
I know Jah'll bless me and open up the doors
I'm living for the young and the old
The blind and the deaf and the dumb as you know
I'm giving, Jah Jah love to all of those
Beautiful people of the world

Government coming with the same damn thing
Millionaire, trillionaires ain't doing one thing
Children listen when the Rastaman sing
No matta' big destruction, 'Gwan praise the King
Warn them and tell them, "there is right over wrong,"
Mr. President why is it you make a bomb?
Everyday is weapon of mass destruction
Seems they got no love for anyone

I'm living for the sick and the poor
The hungry and the shelterless sleeping on the floor
I'm giving what I've got and more
Cause I know that Most High will bless me for sure
I'm living for the young and the old
The blind and the deaf and the dumb as you know
I'm giving, Jah Jah love to all those
Beautiful people of the world

Seems no one care for them
But Jah is there for them
And I'm here for them

Spread some helping hand to the youth
You can only lead them with the truth
Don't you hear them crying
Don't you see them dying

I'm living for the sick and the poor
The hungry and the shelterless sleeping on the floor
I'm giving all I've got and more
I know Jah'll bless me and open up the doors

Government coming with the same damn thing
Millionaire, billionaires is not doing one thing
Children listen when the Rastaman sing
No matta' big destruction, 'Gwan praise the King
Warn them and tell them, "there is right over wrong,"
Mr. President why is it you make the bomb?
Everyday is weapon of mass destruction
Seems they got no love for anyone

I'm living for the sick and the poor
The shelterless, the homeless sleeping on the floor
I'm giving all I've got I'm sure
Most High will open up the doors
I'm living for the young and the old
The blind and the dumb and the sick as you know
