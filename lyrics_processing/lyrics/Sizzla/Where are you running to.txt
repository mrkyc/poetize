CHORUS (2x)
Where are you running to now
Got to be responsible for what you do now
Don't bit the hands that feed you
Don't you turn away from those
Who truly love and really need you
Verse 1:
Don, we seen domething great in you
Wow, the people put alot of faith in you, uuh
You know, we wanna hear you sing
We've been waiting on you
Love coming straight to you
Love and unity is all it took, yeah
Why won't you open your eyes and look
We got, what we want, sing and we chant
Don't be greedy, a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush
CHORUS (2x)
Verse 2:
Hiding you hiding from you self
Why you dont want to see the prising of you self
Too conieving, because thats just how you felt
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling great
I love my health, too ungreatful
All along to take us for granted, too unfaithful
Disrespect the power that was handed,you hateful
Hate will bring you bondage
Make good with love
Don't you know thats the strongest
Woo my children, why you lock the door on dem
Now you get so ignorant
And you want to turn the Glock on them
People who help you in life
Now you turn your back on them
CHORUS (2x)
Verse 3
Don, we seen domething great in you
Wow, the people put alot of faith in you, uuh
You know, we wanna hear you sing
We've been waiting on you
Love coming straight to you
Love and unity is all it took, yeah
Why won't you open your eyes and look
We got, what we want, sing and we chant
Don't be greedy, a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush
