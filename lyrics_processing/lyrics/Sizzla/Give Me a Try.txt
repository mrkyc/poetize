Where do you go
Don't you need my love baby
Why can't you come out and let us play
When are you going to come my way
(ahhhh)
What sort of things they been telling you
I've got to stop them from compelling you
They just won't stop me from getting you
(ahhhhhh)

Give me a try
Cause I know that things will be great
Free your mind don't deny
True love never dies it only creates

I'm going to take you right there
(love) For a life time
I'm going to make you life so clear
Girl, gonna make you mine
I'm going to take you right there
(love) For a life time
I'm going to make you life so clear
Girl, gonna make you mine
Spent a lifetime to make a good life
But mine just won't work
Stars in the sky, look in your eyes
Thats how much you worth
You might also like
I'm not stupid
I'm not a fool
So what I'm doing
I'm into school
Keep a firm grip
On what you hold
Cause its more valuable
Than a pot of gold
I'm going to take you right there
(love) For a life time
I'm going to make you life so clear
Girl, gonna make you mine
I'm going to take you right there
(love) For a life time
I'm going to make you life so clear
Girl, gonna make you mine

Give me a try
Cause I know that things will be great
Free your mind don't deny
True love never dies it only creates
Give me a try
Cause I know that things will be great
Free your mind don't deny
True love never dies it only creates
Where do you go
Don't you need my love baby
Why can't you come out and let us play
When are you going to come my way
(ahhhh)
What sort of things they been telling you
I've got to stop them from compelling you
They just won't stop me from getting you
(ahhhhhh)

You know
So many experience
You gotta solve your problems
