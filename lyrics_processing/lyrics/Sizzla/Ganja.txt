Ganja will take away my stress and strain
Ganja in my meditation, Ganja in my brain
Marijuana take away my stress and pain
Ganja in my meditation, Ganja in my brain
Marijuana take away my stress and pain
Ganja is the medication, Ganja is the cure
Police have been fighting Marijuana for sure
Purify me heavens and make me feel pure
Hundred ways to Cali
Ganja in me meditation, Ganja in my clothes
No offence I'm smokin Marijuana around you
Ganja in me daily, Ganja me currency
Ganja is the currency and daily bread
Give me revelation is the stuff which gets to my head and it's been growing so long that's why we call it love spread
Ganja for the living and it not for the dead, couple puffs of smoke before me go onto bed
Give praise to Jah and shake out me dead

Ganja is my sword from Solomons grave
I think
Ganja in my head that are not quite the same
Same family, Same plant, Different name
Jamaica's love spreads calling Ganja
America's people smoke Ganja in the car
I'm not gonna stop smoking my herbs, well
Am I gonna stop? NO
I'm not gonna stop smoking my herbs
If they get me in touch with the Earth
Make me give thanks for what life is worth
Two-Hundred trees, sweet trees blowing in the breeze
When I look out to my yards and fields
That's how I feel, it's so real
So good I feel, gaze out from my window seat, keeping what I sow
To the
Two-Hundred Cali trees there blowing in the breeze
Ganja in my meditation, Ganja in my brain
Marijuana take away my stress and pain
Ganja in my meditation, Ganja in my brain
Ganja take away my stress and me pain
Ganja is the medication, Ganja is the cure
Police have been fighting Marijuana for sure
Purify my heavens and make my thoughts pure
Hundred way
Ganja in me daily, Ganja in my clothes
No offence I'm smokin Marijuana around you
Ganja is the currency, Ganja daily bread
Give me
Ganja for the living and it not for the dead
Couple sniff of Cali before me go to bed
Make me shake up me
Ganja is my currency, Ganja daily bread
Give me the Marijuana let it get to my head
Ganja is my meditation, Ganja in my brain
Marijuana take away my stress and pain
