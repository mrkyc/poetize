Wow, wow wow
Yeah
Yeah, you got to get going
No time for sitting down
Some people not knowing life is a cycle
You got to know how to get around
Woo!
Ha!

Yes, you got to be strong
And be all the best you can
The world is out there, conquer your fears
And don't you wait too long

The world is out there, conquer your fears
And don't you wait too long

Hi!
How you doing? long time I haven't seen you
Hope you behaving yourself now like a good, behaving citizen
Nothing comes easy, you got to work hard, I'm telling you
Hope and pray for the best 'cause I believe in you
Not like the stereotype, cleanliness intriguing you
Give thanks and praise for my life, and for us being here
Children can't go to school, the system's killing us
There's good in us, and we've always wanted to bring it out!
Show the world what we got, the struggle continues, yo
Check the conditions in which we living, yo
Right now I come giving you...
That you work to be the winner
Our children going to bed without having a dinner

People are filled with expectations, that's fine with me
Opportunity comes but once, so it's time for me
I don't think of failure because the sun shines for me
Something in the back of my head keeps reminding me
Keep on listening ear when when I call
There's good and bad, so just be good and stand tall
A lot of people out there wish for me to fall
I'm not scared, I pray to He who hath created us all
Evils and the demons, woo!, I don't stop with them
Hey, they don't like me? Hey, what's up with them?
I just can't do without Jah's love because it's like the oxygen
I'm don't need no folly, I no inna no crap with them

Yes, you got to be strong
And be all the best you can
The world is out there, conquer your fears
And don't you wait too long
Yes, you got to be strong
And be all the best you can
The world is out there, conquer your fears
And don't you wait too long
