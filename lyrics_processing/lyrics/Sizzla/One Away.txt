Rastafari and I and I love di yutes dem

1. Positively clear
The people inna di world keep forgetting them past
So dem gone astray
So mi bun dem everyday
Dat dem nuh love, conspiracers a talk and never fail
Positively clear
Di people inna di world a lust fi dem top class
Think yuh are actually there
Yuh toe yuh guh buck skate inna grass
CHO
Mi an di yutes a tro one away
Melchesedek way
So if yuh see mi an di yutes dem trodding through the earth
Wi haffi trod it King Selassie way, yeah yeah
Trodding this one away, haffi trod one away
Dem sen 50, 60, 70 pagan
Mi slew dem off in space a one day
2. Well you see
The people inna di west
Di whole a dem gone crazy
Love fi big up dem chest yet dem dey inna slavery
