Gonna keep your banner flowing so high, I
Reaching out to all the mothers in the world
Sometimes it's just the way things are to be, yeah
Chorus
Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
All those pain and sufferin
No one knows the pressure you bare a just only you
Give you all my love oh yea
Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
All those pain and sufferin
No one knows the pressure you bare a just only you
This is my words and my utterin
Mama I would never let you down
I'll never go away, I'll always be around
You know why you do it, such love that you found
I'm always gonna let you wear that crown
Through the roughest of times you maintain your calm
Jah was your only help While shelterin me from the storm
And when its cold you wrap me in a towel so warm
Oh ma oh ma, I'm so glad I was born
CHORUS
Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
All those pain and suffering
No one knows the pressure you bare a just only you
Give you all my love oh yea
Oh Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
All those pain and suffering
No one knows the pressure you bare just only you
This is my word
I'm gonna make you so proud, such good son you have
You are the one who teaches me all the good form the bad
Even when the system keeps pressurin my dad
You got high hopes, thanks be unto the most high God
CHORUS
Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
All those pain and suffering
No one knows the pressure you bare a just only you
Give you all my love oh yea
Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
All those pain and suffering
All my visions, aspirations I owe it all onto you
This is my words and my offering
I'm a big man now that's how things go
Things you do to survive only Jah he knows
Fiercely protecting us while watchin us grow
You been up even when its on the down low
Work so hard to see us go to school
Blisters on your fingers so they can't take us for fool
I'm here for a purpose, I'm here to rule
Most high Jah Rastafari will see us through
CHORUS
Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
All those pain an suffering
No one knows the pressure you bare a just only you
Give you all my love oh yea
Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
All those pain an suffering
No one knows the pressure you bare just only you
Ohhhh
Now it's my turn to make life, I'm so mature
Now I got my kids and my wife and I'm positivley sure
I'm doing fine and still can be so much more
You've prepared me for the future my love you deserve
Keeps doing your thing while others not knowing
But deep inside your heart mama you know where it was going
Can a mother lose her tender care for her child that she's been showin
Some how your star keeps glowin ow
CHORUS
Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through
