It's a beautiful day, smile with the world
Put your problems away, welcome the love
Doesn't matter what they say
Priority first, no violence, no one getting hurt
I can't blame you
For being yourself, things gwon work out right
All you do is keep the goals in sight
No one is perfect
Everyone is searching to master the rems of life
All you do is keep the love inside
I think about you every day, I think about you every time
Girl never wan you stray, wanna keep you fine
Love is everywhere, and love is here and now
Set your mind at ease and enjoy the day
No think of what did you and that's just the way
It's peaceful and calm so you accomplish more
Use the love in your heart to knock upon the door
Let nothing change you, it's the way you were born
Way I respect you no words can tell
May Jah bless you and I always wish you well
