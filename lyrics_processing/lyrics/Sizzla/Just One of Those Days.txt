I'm missing you

Dry cry - even tears
Even my heart cries but who cares
Whose fault? No one but myself
Things do happen, words can't explain
The only human reasoning joy meets with pain
People would spend time just for us to separate
They don't want to see us reach nowhere
Oh girl and you know I care

Why does it have to be this way?
Can't tell you go, can't tell you to stay
Just one of those days
Just one of those days

Am I too humble or ignorant?
Things began to fade, nothing seems important
Oh my girl has left me and gone
Doesn't want to see her in another's arm
The essence of her beauty and charm
The perfume still lingers... oh damn
Remember girl where we coming from
I'm the one to who you belong
Whoa yay
Girl you keep me strong
You, I don want another one
Why does it have to be this way?
Can't tell you go, can't tell you to stay
Just one of those days
Just one of those days

Keep looking to see her at my gate
Listening to hear the phone ring by the fireplace
Now, somewhere out there is my girl
Now, where can I find her in this world?
Still not gonna break down
Nor be sad even though I'm stressed out
Fed up and feeling mad
I just can't do it wit out her
Oh, Jah
Still I got to try

Why does it have to be this way?
Can't tell you go, can't tell you to stay
Just one of those days
Just one of those days

Is this happening for real?
Only if you know the pangs that I feel
Still tryin to doo my best
And I still won't lose my intrest
My girl I love u soo
