All that you showed me
The power and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes
CHORUS
Give us this day
All that you showed me
The power and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes
Give me all the
Storybook told me
The faith and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes
And they say that in our time
All that's good will fall from grace
Even saints would turn their face
In our time
And they told us that in our days
Different words said in different ways
Have other meaning from he who says
In our time
CHORUS
Give us this day
All that you showed me
The power and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes
Give me all the
Storybook told me
The faith and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes

We would reap from their legacy
We would learn from what they had seen
In our time
And they told us that in our days
We would know what was high on high
We would follow and not defy
In our time
CHORUS
Give us this day
All that you showed me
The power and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes
Give me all the
Storybook told me
The faith and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes
Faithless in faith
We must behold the things we see
CHORUS
Give us this day
All that you showed me
The power and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes
Give me all the
Storybook told me
The faith and the glory
'Til my kingdom comes
