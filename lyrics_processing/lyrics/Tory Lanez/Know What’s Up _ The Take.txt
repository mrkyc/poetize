(Mustard on the beat, ho)

She drop that damn thing on me
I stand up throwin' bands up, girl, everything on me
You know I'm in this bitch with my niggas, long thing in my jeans
It's gettin' late and these niggas rowdy, don't leave without it on me
I got them stones all in my chain (Whoa)
Big dollar my bank (Roll)
Said that she ain't cuttin', I said "What the fuck did you came for?" (What the fuck you came for?)
T.O. nigga, it's T.O. bitch
I'm headin' to wherever I'm gon' see your bitch
If niggas hatin' on me, put the hammer all in my hands
When she see me up in that three, she went magic all on her man
'Cause she know what's up
Oh yeah, she know what's up

You ain't got a man? Come fuck wit' me (Uh-huh)
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG (Uh-huh)
You know I got them bands, they all on me (Uh-huh)
I know you wanna roll, so, you can tell me no
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
You might also like
Say you ain't got a man, sure enough
I pull up in that Lamb', hold up (Hold up)
We both want it, we can't blame no one
And I ain't tryna play no one
But he can't make you famous like this
No, he don't got you feignin' like this
Say, he might had your body but tonight I'm in yo' soul (Yo' soul)
Girl, just keep playin' my shit
Lo-love the way I talk, I make you love the way I sing (Sing)
Love the way I walk, I'll make you love the way I swang (Swang)
Girl, I make you (Make you)
Love everything that you don't love about these niggas
Girl, I love you naked (Love you naked)

You ain't got a man? Come fuck wit' me (Uh-huh)
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG (Uh-huh)
You know I got them bands, they all on me (Uh-huh)
I know you wanna roll, so, you can tell me no
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up

'Cause when you drop that thing on me
Like it's the end of the night
I swear if niggas hate, you know I got that thing on me
No need for no fight
You ain't got a man? Come fuck wit' me (Uh-huh)
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG (Uh-huh)
You know I got them bands, they all on me (Uh-huh)
I know you wanna roll, so, you can tell me no
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up


Hop in, oh, what's up?
When I seen that body go down
And your friends at the club
Me, I'm really tryna go
Now that I got you, it's goin' down
So girl, don't you run from me
'Cause what I like, you like, we gon' like
I'ma feel up, feel down, feels alright
Might have to fly your ass to Toronto
(Hold up, why?)
'Cause shawty got that ass like a model, oh
And all these other women ain't got nothin' on her
You know that ass stop me from leavin' here tonight and tomorrow
I officially laid it down
Oh, I laid it down
She has been taken since the the day I laid it down, down, down, down
