You're all that's on my mind
I wasted time, I know
Wish I could just rewind
While I was gone you left
Gone away for good
Least you could've done was let me know
Guess I misunderstood
This time I waited too long
This time the feeling's too strong
Anticipated too long
There's only one thing I want

I wanna get them draws from ya
Tonight I'm goin' hard for ya
Tonight she takin' all of me, yeah
Fargo
I wanna get them draws from ya
