I remember nights I used to sleep on the floor
I see them days, I don't ever wanna go back no more
Now my little bitch wanna fuck my bitch and I'ma let her fuck her
Pull up in a new estate, I got a Bentley truck
Got Ciroc, in the shot, like it came from Diddy
Got a hundred wild niggas that won't change for pussy
