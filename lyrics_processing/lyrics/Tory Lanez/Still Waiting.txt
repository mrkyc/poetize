I really hope you never ever get to love me
I'm thinkin' of all the times that you dubbed me
Now that I'm poppin', you got me right where I wanna
Right where I wanted to be when you would love me
Caught you slippin' in LIV and sippin' bubbly
You took a look at these niggas, ain't none above me
I tried to give you my heart, but girl, you don't know
I tried to show you affection, but no, it won't show
I told you, "Baby, just wait, we need some time and all"
I told you just love me, give me some time to ball
The way you lookin' is like a thousand dollars
With my confidence, took every ounce to holler
I really hope you never get to love me
I wanna be somewhere stuntin', sippin' on bubbly
Not even a thought of you in my mind
Visions of you went blind
Ooh, you used to call just to tell me
That you ain't all the way get it, but, girl, you felt me
Part of that reason why I always try to tell you
You held it down, I'ma get you the bag with the Chanel C's
'Cause it was us against the world, fuck what they tell me
I figured they was hatin' on us and it was jealousy
But I should've listened to the shit they was tellin' me
I thought you was takin' a W, it was just an L on me
Now I'm caught up in this situation where L-O-V got the best of me
I'm tryna find somethin', tryna align somethin'
Still hopin' and prayin' that you'll be my somethin'
Out layin', and hopin' prayin' that you done datin' me
I know I treat you better than your man, yeah, fuck that nigga
Tryna treat you better than he can
You might also like
I know you that you ain't really 'bout to dub me
I know you wanna tell me that you love me
Girl, I know you wanna ride it like a Harley
Know you wanna let me swim in that tsunami
Swear I never felt like this way 'bout nobody
Swear I never felt this way 'bout nobody
Girl, you got me doing things that's just not me
Sprung over you, girl, I cannot be
Girl, I know some things have changed (Things have changed)
But you see, you and me, we still a thing (Oh)
I can't get you out my mind, girl
You know you've been actin' out of line, girl
Don't say, "Not today," 'cause today I got the time, girl
I been actin' like I'm fine, girl
Goin' insane, losin' my brain
You playin' these games, but you know I ain't
I don't be trippin' off bitches, this strange
Not to call you out your name, you know you my main
Man, fuck this fame
How they came in our world, changed everything?
Right away, in a day
Niggas hate, bitches hate
Niggas fake, bitches fake

Hey, look at him, man
I hope he doesn't hurt you too bad
Girl, I know some things have changed (Things have changed)
But you see, you and me, we still a thing (Oh)

Really, baby, you should never get to love me
Pillow talkin' with niggas and tryna dub me
You really got the audacity to discuss me
You really got some audacity, you disgust me
And it'd kill me to say these things about you but
I know the way you think about the two of us
I know the way you think about movin' on
But me, girl, I'm not used to maneuverin' much
Tell me I'm doin' enough
Tell me I'm doin' too much
Tell me that you've been in love
Girl, you not doin' enough
I threw the towel in twenty times, I threw it too much
Baby, this shit been a lot
Plus you've been doin' enough
You can't lie, you got time
You heard stories about my drip
Why does it take for me to do somethin' good
For you to come around? That's why I drift
And I know (Know), you's a pro (Pro)
Known for heartbreak after the sheets
I'm tryna keep my composure, I'm a soldier
And deep down, I'm still a G, so (Yeah)
I'm gon' raise my glass to this (Raise it up)
Fly back to Los Angeles (Back to Hollywood)
Won't forget you were scandalous (Won't forget)
Won't forget you were scandalous, yeah (No)
I'm gon' raise my glass to this (Raise it up)
Fly back to Los Angeles (Fly on back)
Won't forget you were scandalous (Won't forget)
