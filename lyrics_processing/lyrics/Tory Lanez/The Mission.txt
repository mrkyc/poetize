Can someone tell that bitch, take her shoes off at the door?
When she walk all on my marble floor, I stunt like I'm supposed to
Black dreads hangin' off my niggas, shouts to Noah
Walk inside my crib, see dough so thick she can't even fold
Tell me why your bitch keep patrollin' like she 5-0
Say that she my bitch, but that bitch ain't even side ho
She gon' keep on workin' it for Fargo 'til her thighs broke
I can't throw no benjis if I ever see my side broke
Talk about your money, that's that shit that I don't gotta
Would talk about your bitch, but tell the truth, man I forgot her
I'm smokin' on some potent shit, that's loud as a whole choir
And I don't say shut up no more, I just tell a ho quiet
They know why, shit 'cause
I been with the killers talkin' dealers smoke
Niggas speakin' to you, but ain't really talkin'
Sittin' in the trap, eatin' cup of noodles
Higher than a nigga, Andy Milonakis
Niggas used to get it by the 8-ball
Now he tryna get it by the boat load
Condo sittin' out SoHo, smokin' on high grade
Sippin' on slow mo', nigga what's up?

And you always said I'd be the one
Said I'd be the one
Spendin' all my 24 to get it
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission

Shit, don't forget to tell yo' bitch, take your shoes off at the door
When she walk on top this Persian rug, I stunt like I'm supposed to
Backwood swingin', smokin', hangin' out the door
Black drawers showin', jaw glowin' from my gold
Ghetto boujee nigga, order steak but eat them ramen noodles
Don't love yo' bitch, just fuck yo' bitch when I got time to do it
I say she lyin' if she say she wasn't tryna do it
Fargo ain't no rookie, man, that boy a pussy connoisseur
I know she won't fuck a famous nigga and be lit
Just like I'm playin' tag 'cause I can't fuck unless she it
It's your nigga, Argie Fargo, bitch, you used to braid my hair
Now you here up in my condo tryna fuck and be legit
Is she trill? Shit?
I be in the city where my niggas loco
By the Yorkdale while the bitches open
Bitch, this nigga wavy like I'm in the ocean
Pray we never got to let the semi open
Ain't into the he said, she said shit
Unless he said, she said that she take, uh
Ridin' 'round the city fuck one time
Shawty fuckin' wit' me but I only fuck one time, Fargo

And you always said I'd be the one
Said I'd be the one
Spendin' all my 24 to get it
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission
