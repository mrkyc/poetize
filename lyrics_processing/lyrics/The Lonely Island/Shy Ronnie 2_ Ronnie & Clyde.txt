We've done the work, we know the system
We have the firepower, and we have each other
You ready?
*hesitant moan*

Yeah, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
We at it again, everybody now

Hands in the air, it's a stick up, stick up
No funny business or you get lit up, lit up
You test I (I), you gon' die (Die)
And at your funeral, your mama gon' cry
So customers, press the floor, floor
And clerks, open cash drawers slow, slow
If you don't wanna end up dead
You'll do everything Shy Ronnie says
Tell 'em, Ronnie

Hey, it's Shy Ronnie, and you down on the floor
You're doing it in a bank
No one in the bank can hear you
 rest of your life
Shy Ronnie, use your outside voice
 cops come 
We don't have time for this
Haha!
Let's go
You might also like
So, stay on the ground, it's a stick up, stick up
Your wallets and jewels, we'll pick up, pick up
Unload the cash (Cash), move your ass (Ass)
We getting' money, tell 'em, Shy Ronnie

Back on the scene, Shy Ronnie with the heat
 no time 
Please, please use your words
 nonstop
Just imagine that everyone's naked
Where am I now?  rising to the top
Uh, oh, boner alert!
He really pictured them naked
Haha!
Why did I think you could do this?

Ronnie, hostage on the move!
(*Gunshot*) He shot himself
And why is your gun so small?
The police are on their way
Come out with your hands up
Good luck, Shy Ronnie
Bye-bye!
Haha!
Ronnie, motherfucker, and I'm back from the dead
Brain bored with the murder, so I shot my own leg
Don't get the name twisted, 'cause I'm crazy as shit
I hung a giant-ass noose off my giant-ass dick
 everytime

Ay! I forgot this money
And also this guy
Come on, we're gonna have sex
Too-da-loo!

And you can hang from it
'Cause you don't wanna see my real gun
Shots to the sky
But your face sound real fun
