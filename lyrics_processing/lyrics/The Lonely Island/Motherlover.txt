Oh, dang
What is it, dawg?
I forgot it's Mother's Day
Didn't get a gift for her?
Other plans got in the way
She'll be so disappointed
Damn, I forgot it, too
This could have been avoided
What the hell are we gonna do?

My mom's been so alone
Ever since my daddy left (Cold)
No one to hold her tight
Life has put her to the test
I know just what you mean
My mom's been so sad and gray (Word)
My dad can't satisfy her
In the bedroom ever since he passed away
Hold up
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I'm thinkin' I think it too
Slow up
What time is it, dawg?
It's time for a switcharoo
We both love our moms
Women with grown women needs
I say we break 'em off
Show 'em how much they really mean
You might also like
'Cause I'm a Motherlover
You're a Motherlover
We should fuck each other's mothers
Fuck each other's moms
I'll push in that lady, where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt this shit is crazy
Fucking each other's moms

'Cause every Mother's Day needs a Mother's Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin' on you 'cause I can't do it myself
To me, you're like a brother, so be my mother lover

I'll be layin' in the cut waitin' for your mom
Clutchin' on this lube and roses
I got my digital camera
I'ma make your momma do a million poses
They will be so surprised
We are so cool and thoughtful
Can't wait to pork your mom
I'ma be the syrup, she can be my waffle
Sho' Nuff
My momma loves bubble bath with chamomile
Straight up
Give it to my mom d-d-d-d-d-d-doggy style (Yeah)
This is the perfect plan
For a perfect Mother's Day
They'll have to rename this one
All up under the covers day
'Cause I'm a Motherlover
You're a Motherlover
We should fuck each other's mothers
Fuck each others moms
I'll push in that lady, where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt that shit is crazy
Fucking each other's moms

Break it down
It would be my honor to be your new step-father
It would be my honor to be your new step-father
And while you're in my mother
Make me another brother (Jam)
And while I'm in your mother
I'll never use a rubber (Oh!)

'Cause every Mother's Day needs a Mother's Night (Yeah)
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right (Doing it)
I'm callin' on you 'cause I can't do it myself
To me, you're like a brother, so be my mother lover
They blessed us both with the gift of life (Oh-ho)
She brought you in this world so I'ma sex her right
This is the second best idea that we've ever had (Uh-huh)
The choice can be no other
Be my mother lover
