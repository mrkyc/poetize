Eh, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rihanna
And Shy Ronnie

We're like fire and ice
Taking over the whole world (The whole world)
From the mountaintops
Down to the boys and girls (The boys and girls)
And this tree of knowledge, it grows 'cause we plant the seed (Yeah, ee-ee, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We the teachers of this and we got just what you need
Shy Ronnie

My name is Shy Ronnie and I'm walking the streets
You can't tell me nothin', 'cause I'm, straight up equipped
Speak up
When I pop two champagnes we all sippin' bottles
Shy Ronnie, speak up
 and we take it full throttle
My name is Shy Ronnie, and I'm the best of the best 
Okay, I'll take it from here
Ha ha!
Okay

Move the mic away from your face

Name's Shy Ronnie and I'm running this shit
You know I stay steady strapped because life is a bitch
Rihan-

I forgot my purse
You can't mess with my money 'cause 
And I got so many moves
Bye bye again
So if I can guarantee
You can get with me but I can't get with you
And I don't need no beat
I'll keep on making acapella
Yeah, you should hang with me
