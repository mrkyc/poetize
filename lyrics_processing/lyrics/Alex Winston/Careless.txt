Languish, won't you leave me
Cause I'm trying so hard
And, still, I feel the weight of
Every pound, like an anchor
Through the ground

And, sometimes
I hear myself say, "No"
Before I try
And, even if I did it all wrong
Would that be so wrong
It's been so long, oh

So, give me the heat
Up from the floor
I need to feel
The blood rush more
I want to be
Careless
Why can't I be
Careless
Give it to me
I'm down on the floor
Make me believe
This can't be ignored
I want to be
Careless
Why can't I be
Careless with you
Careless with you
You might also like
No, it's not my business
But he built bridges
None I'll ever see, but
That don't make no difference
Cause, in the same sense
I'm not losing sleep

And, sometimes
I hear myself say, "No"
Before I try
And, even if I did it all wrong
Would that be so wrong
It's been so long, oh

So, give me the heat
Up from the floor
I need to feel
The blood rush more
I want to be
Careless
Why can't I be
Careless
Give it to me
I'm down on the floor
Make me believe
This can't be ignored
I want to be
Careless
Why can't I be
Careless with you

Why can't I be
Why can't I be
Why can't I be
Careless with you
Why can't I be
Why can't I be
Why can't I be
Careless

Bury me in anything
I know you want to
Bury me in anything
You know that I want you
Bury me in anything
I know you want to
Bury me in anything
I know you want to

So, give me the heat
Up from the floor
I need to feel
The blood rush more
I want to be
Careless
Why can't I be
Careless
Give it to me
I'm down on the floor
Make me believe
This can't be ignored
I want to be
Careless
Why can't I be
Careless with you
Languish, won't you leave me
Cause I'm trying so hard
And, still, I feel the weight of
Every pound, like an anchor
Through the ground
Even if I did it all wrong
I did it all wrong
Oh, oh
(Bury me in anything)
