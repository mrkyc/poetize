Study how she moves
Straight into my twisted temptation
All of these thoughts
Got me being a monster without an intention to get caught
I'm your neighbor, I'll be your best friend
I'll be with you when you're at your end
With a smile you will not suspect
Don't make me upset
Got you in the throes
And now you can't go
Keep you for my own
Fingers & Toes
Envision you're a dream
I'll tear you at the seams
You could be my queen
I'll cherish all your pieces
Oh, you silly girl
Never be alone
I got your skin and bones
Such a pretty girl
I love it when you're crying you know oh oh oh oh
You know oh oh oh oh
You might also likeHow you fascinate
Such anticipation
I can almost taste it, taste it
Oh what fun we make
We'll play operation
You can be my patient in this game
I'm your neighbor, I'll be your best friend
I'll be with you when you're at your end
With a smile you will not suspect
Don't make me upset
Got you in the throes
And now you can't go
Keep you for my own
Fingers & Toes
Envision you're a dream
I'll tear you at the seams
You could be my queen
I'll cherish all your pieces
Oh, you silly girl
Never be alone
I got your skin and bones
Such a pretty girl
I love you when you're crying you know oh oooh
Got you in the throes
And now you can't go
Keep you for my own
Fingers & Toes
Envision you're a dream
I'll tear you at the seams
You could be my queen
I'll cherish all your pieces
Oh, you silly girl
Never be alone
I got your skin and bones
Such a pretty girl
I love you when you're crying you know oh oh oh oh
