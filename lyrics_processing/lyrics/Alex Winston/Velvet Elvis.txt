Ma said I ain't right
Clutchin' on you all night
But you're my, you're my guy
Elvis
Slice my starry eye
Light his coat in turpentine
Kill the bitch that bats an eye
Elvis

When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
Hold your frame, whisper your name
When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
And you don't breathe, so you can't leave

And they're comin'
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no
And they're comin'
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no
And they're comin'
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no
And they're comin'
They're comin'
They're comin'
Whoaa no
You might also like
Touch, shackled, arms are tied
Cause papa said I crossed the line
Caught us in our special time
Elvis
Now it's five by five
Finger paint and circle time
I'll love you till the day I die
Elvis
