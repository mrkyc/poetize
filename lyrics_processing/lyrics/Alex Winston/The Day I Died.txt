Give me an exorcism, lord knows how bad I need one
Said it's been such a while since I've seen your white tiles
In a smile position without an opposition
Well I guess I'm alive but I feel three thousand miles away

(I see you coming to me)
Away
(I see you coming to me)

I was asleep until the day I died
I was dug deep, six feet, eyes open wide
Slack jawed on the assembly line
That I built in my own mind
I was asleep until the day I died
(I see you coming to me)

I need an exorcism, this ain't no way of living
Slow and steady down the aisle but my heart is a child
With an inner demon pleading to be forgiven
Shake me out if I'm alive, cause I feel three thousand miles away

(I see you coming to me)
Away
(I see you coming to me)

I was asleep until the day I died
I was dug deep, six feet, eyes open wide
Slack jawed on the assembly line
That I built in my own mind
I was asleep until the day I died
(I see you coming to me)
(I see you coming to me)
(I see you coming to me)
(I see you coming to me)
(I see you coming to me)
(I see you coming to me)
(I see you coming to me)

I was asleep until the day I died
I was dug deep, six feet, eyes open wide
Slack jawed on the assembly line
That I built in my own mind
I was asleep until the day I died
(I see you coming to me)

I see you coming to me
I see you coming... (But I heard every word)
I see you coming to me
I see you coming... (But I heard every word)
(Until the day I died)
(But I heard every word)
I see you coming...
I see you coming... (But I heard every word)
