But never did I say I wouldn't steal it from you
And we'll save your grace with the devil in my eye
Everybody knows all the honest ones lie
And you think you know me
Darlin' you don't know
Ah oh oh, ah oh oh
I'll eat you like you're a host
And when I'm done, I'm done
That was fun but son
Off you go
Ah oh oh, ah oh oh
Feed on you like you're a host
And when I'm done, I'm done
That was fun but son
Off you go...
Lord how thick the thief that I might
Been running back around trying to make things right
And my brightest moods are in the dark of night
I've got the green on my side and it's yours against mine
And you think you know me
Darlin' you don't know
You might also likeAh oh oh, ah oh oh
I'll eat you like you're a host
And when I'm done, I'm done
That was fun but son
Off you go
Ah oh oh, ah oh oh
Feed on you like you're a host
And when I'm done, I'm done
That was fun but son
Off you go...
With one eye I'd sleep if I were you
(You said you'd get me out)
With one eye I lied I said to you
(You said you'd be there)
With one eye I'd sleep if I were you
(You said you'd get me out)
With one eye
(I lied)
I said
(I lied)
I said
(I lied)
I said
(I lied)
I said
Ah oh oh, ah oh oh
I'll eat you like you're a host
And when I'm done, I'm done
That was fun but son
Off you go
Ah oh oh, ah oh oh
Feed on you like you're a host
And when I'm done, I'm done
That was fun but son
