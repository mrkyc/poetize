Clutching on you all night
But you're my, you're my guy, Elvis
Slice my starry eye
Light his coat in turpentine
Kill the bitch that bats an eye, Elvis
When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
Hold your frame, whisper your name
When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
And you don't breathe, so you can't leave
And they're comin' they're comin' they're comin' whoaa no
And they're comin' they're comin' they're comin' whoaa no
And they're comin' they're comin' they're comin' whoaa no
And they're comin' they're comin' they're comin' whoaa no
(Touch) Shackled arms are tight
Cause' papa said I cross the line
Carve us in our special time, Elvis
Now it's five by five
Finger paint and circle time
I love you till the day I die, Elvis
When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
Hold your frame, whisper your name
When I feel your velvet, I can't help it
And you don't breathe, so you can't leave
And they're comin' they're comin' they're comin' whoaa no
And they're comin' they're comin' they're comin' whoaa no
And they're comin' they're comin' they're comin' whoaa no
And they're comin' they're comin' they're comin' whoaa no
