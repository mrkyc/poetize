You could fall in love, fall apart
But I don't really care as long as you fade away
(As long as you fade, as long as you fade
As long as you fade, as long as you fade)
To nothing more than a body in the yard
A constellation hidden in the dark
Just go

Cause If I fight it all, I'm gonna lose it
Acting like an animal, I don't want you to know
(As long as you fade, as long as you fade
As long as you fade, as long as you fade)
The truth

But honey when I think of you
Drag my feet on the ground
Go steady with my head down low
I know it ain't right to hold tight
But I can't let
Go
Go
Go
I can't let
Go
Go
Go
But I can't let go
You might also like
The golden night, you let it die
Conversation so bone dry
(As long as you fade, as long as you fade
As long as you fade, as long as you fade)
And I'm a fool to think that I'm fooling this
Cause my heart still bleeds like an idiot
And I know
That you don't care about me anymore

Cause If I fight it all, I'm gonna lose it
Acting like an animal, I don't want you to know
(As long as you fade, as long as you fade
As long as you fade, as long as you fade)
The truth

But honey when I think of you
Drag my feet on the ground
Go steady with my head down low
I know it ain't right to hold tight
But I can't let
Go
Go
Go
I can't let
Go
Go
Go
But I can't let
Go
Go
Go
But I can't let
Oh...
Go
Go
