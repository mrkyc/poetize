And your heart will see new things
Some day there'll be no parade
And you'll see what life can bring
You made me wait for you
While your brilliant mind was seething
I guess you didn't know that you were
The only thing that kept me breathing
I said the things I said
Not because I meant to harm you
Now you know that I'm nearly dead
I'll just bet that it kind of warms you
You left me out on the edge of the world
You played your cards and your power as the girl
You watched with pride as your flag unfurled
And you watched me fall from the edge of the world
Revenge is so sweet they say
But they don't tell you that it eats you
Your crowd is gathered round today
But some day they're the ones who'll beat you
I know that I'm wrong about
What came out of me last time we talked
But do you have to shout it out
That you think that I would really walk
You might also likeYou left me out on the edge of the world
You played your cards and your power as the girl
You watched with pride as your flag unfurled
And you watched me fall from the edge of the world
You said I could never be too intense
It only proved that I really loved you
You said that it all made sense
That I would put no one above you
And now with just one slip on my part
You've used that to damn me
If you felt the desperation in my heart
Then maybe you wouldn't slam me
You left me out on the edge of the world
You played your cards and your power as the girl
You watched with pride as your flag unfurled
And you watched me fall from the edge of the world
I pray you never lose your face
I hope it stays brand new
'Cause in this world it's the place
Where everybody seems to love you
And where I live it doesn't mean a thing
I'll be there in forever
If you ever hear my heart sing
