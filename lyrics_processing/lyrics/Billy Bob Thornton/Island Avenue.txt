Kicking empty beer cans, mumbling in a monotone
And whatever madness the sidewalk show presents
But I've got no time, I've got no desire for painted girls for rent
Or uptown chicks in daddy's cars
The ragtops down shooting for the stars
It's me and it's them, the night's been ripped in two
I couldn't sleep, it's too late for me to call
If I stayed home I'd punch more holes in my apartment wall
I drove down town and tried to come alive
Instead I'm drinking this morning's coffee in this all night dive
And I'll be here for a little while
Think of all the numbers I could dial
Tonight and, god knows, I've got more than a few
But I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
You know it's not long until I'm
I'm going to leave this circus far behind
And drive the night straight through
To Island Avenue
You might also likeYou know I love to walk these streets alone
I thought all I ever wanted was to be out here on my own
But, yes, I'm fascinated by your ways
And, yes, I must admit that you have set me all ablaze
Well, crazy promises that no man can keep
As I slam the door of my battered heap
As I hear the engine start I take my cue
'Cause I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
You know it's not long until I'm
I'm going to leave this circus far behind
And drive the night straight through
To Island Avenue
'Cause I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
I don't want nobody, don't need nobody, I want you
