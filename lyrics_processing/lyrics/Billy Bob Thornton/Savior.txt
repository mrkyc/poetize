And your heart is full of fear
A saviour doesn't visit
Miracles don't appear
The minute hand ticks slower
And the hour hand don't move
When you can't dream the future
And you have something to prove
If you need an explosion
To clean out all the pain
Clouds just swell in silence
While you're waiting for the rain
The phone looks like a cobra
On the table by the bed
Even if your saviour called
Everything's been said
Your nerves grow through your swollen soul
Like racing evil vines
You read her goodbye letter
And try to see between the lines
Praying to be sleeping
When the house burns to the ground
But hoping on the other hand
That somehow you'll be found
You might also likePeople try to be a friend
And come by for a talk
But when they start the speech
The words just break in two like chalk
Waiting for the sweat
That pours out when the fever breaks
Wishing you could take back
Every one of your mistakes
Do you find a fix?
Do you give up on everything
And sit and take your licks?
Do the lonely and the broken ones
Keep waiting for it all
Or do they just lay down
And accept the bitter fall?
But then some tiny magic
Starts to grow and warm your veins
That mystery of life
That somehow keeps you kind of sane
A daydream starts to grow
That hasn't been there in a while
The kids are in the back yard
And it makes you start to smile
The saviour rushes in
And grabs you hard and holds you strong
And not the one you wait for
The one that's been there all along
The daydream doesn't end
Instead your smile turns to a laugh
As the young ones teach you once again
To be the better half
So you suck the poison from your blood
And kick the bastard out
And walk out in the sunlight
Into what it's all about
You can't find a fix
You can't give up on anything
Especially when you're sick
If you're a lonely or a broken one
Keep giving it your all
So when you finally lay down
