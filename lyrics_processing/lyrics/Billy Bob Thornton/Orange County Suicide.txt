And snaked to my car
The haggard little spouse
Had a thing for seedy bars
She begged to let her ride
Then she drooled on my jeans
She was crazy in her eyes
And busting at the seams
And then she took a matchstick
And scraped at her wrist
But her skin wasn't breaking
So she made herself a fist
I guess the years at the spa
Had grown a tough hide
It ain't easy to pull
It ain't easy to pull
It ain't easy to pull off
Orange County suicide
Behind the orange curtain
Way on the other side
Our future looked uncertain
As we hit El Toro Y
We saw the devil walking
While angels ran around
There was no sense in talking
The ship had run aground
You might also likeA look of desperation
Came all over her face
A-crying and a-cussing
Stepping up the pace
She grabbed the box of little matches
Guess she wasn't satisfied
It ain't easy to pull
It ain't easy to pull
It ain't easy to pull off
Orange County suicide
If you do it, you got to do it for real
Don't do it, just to see how I feel
If you do it, you got to do it for real
Go through it, then tell me how you feel
She was pretty as a flower
And sturdy as a pearl
She came with all the powers
You would want in a girl
But nothing's ever simple
When you're on the cutting edge
Smoothing every wrinkle
And honouring every pledge
In a house of cards
She was playing every hand
The world on her finger
And me at her command
She was all wound up
And she finally came untied
It ain't easy to pull
It ain't easy to pull
It ain't easy to pull off
Orange County suicide
Well, if you do it, you got to do it for real
Don't do it, just to see how I feel
If you do it, you got to do it for real
