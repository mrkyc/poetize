And you said let me out of this cage right now
And New Orleans was to be the next stop
People are free there to breathe when they want
It turned out the heat was too great there
They wore blue suits and they ate there
A U-Haul trailer and a girlfriend
Took you to San Francisco bay
For peace, for love and happiness
But something went wrong in the middle of the night
Who knows what makes a heart race too fast?
And who knows what makes it just stop?
Somehow I still feel it was a mistake
And surely it wasn't just your heartbreak
And maybe the sky was just running out of hope
And maybe the heavens opened up and dropped down a rope
And you grabbed it
Sometimes on clear days I try to find you
But I never see anything but space
And sometimes in the middle of the night
I hear a whisper and sometimes a scream
Well, I wonder what you're trying to say
I think I may know what it is
'Cause I'm still here and I'm trying to win
And you're trying to tell me that I can't
'Cause there's not enough love to fill me here
My heart races fast just like yours
You might also likeI'll never forget that last look on your face
And maybe you were too good for this place
And maybe the sky was just running out of hope
And maybe the heavens opened up and dropped down a rope
My brother, my brother, my brother
My brother, my brother, my brother
Fast hearts just like yours
My brother
Fast hearts just like yours
My brother
Fast hearts just like yours
My brother
Fast hearts just like yours
My brother
Fast hearts just like yours
My brother
