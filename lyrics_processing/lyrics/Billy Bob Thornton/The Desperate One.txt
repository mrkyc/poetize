You told me that you heard me and that you'd learn to use the phone
I told you that I was really scared, I may not last
I said I was desperate, an emergency was coming fast
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
I thought you were my friend
I waited for the blood you promised me that you would let
In my soul I prayed that you would never forget
You said sign my life away to your command
And now I can't describe how little I understand
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
I thought you were my friend
Do you really want to let me be?
Do you really want to let me see the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
Do you really want to let me be the desperate one?
