To tell them to change from their evil and tricky ways
Jonah knew what the men where like, so he didn't want to go
He decided to turn and go the other way
(Chorus)
Jonah, where are you going?
You were sent to Nineveh to warn the people
Jonah, where are you going?
You were sent to Nineveh, were you are gone?
Jonah went to the ocean
The ocean motion, threw and fall
And I know that Jonah dig back through
Back on the land
The old
The glory of Haile, Haile, Haile
The old
The coming of the most Haile, Haile, Haile. Haile!
Do you remember the downfall of Sodoma and Gomorrah? (Do you?)
Do you remember the things they used to do?
If you do the bad, it gonna follow you (follow you)
If you do the good, it gonna take you through
