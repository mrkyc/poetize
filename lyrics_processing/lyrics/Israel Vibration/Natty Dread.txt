Nowdays them a braid, twist and them a plot
I and I natty are dreadlocks
Nowdays them a braid, twist and them a plot
I and I natty are dreadlocks

Remember way back when Rasta had no friend
When he was down in his luck and couldn't find a buck
Babylon and his friends, there ain't no end I and I a penitentiary

Bad Boy, them a run things (Yeah)
I went to Jamdown and over foreign
Bad Boy have fi run things here
A nuff bad man live in a foreign

Shot a Glock over in a Matches Lane
Grandmama all already pain
Trying to get Johnny one visa
Send him at foreign, life would be easier
Down the lane fire one pop
Now in a foreign, fire big Glock
Left from York, you call him exportee
Now him return, you call him deportee

Talk burn when elementary
No body an done at Casa Boboli
But in the ghetto wish Brooklyn New York
You can't trust shadow in the dark
So you see we juggling skills
I set up roots in a Cypress Hills

Bad Boy, them a run things here
Whether Jamdown or in a foreign
Bad Boy have fi run things here
Nuff bad man live in a foreign


Back in the days this was like a ghost town
And every day just another shot down
Eighteen God, Cypress pon lock
Before the nigga man a jiggle on the block
So you see we juggling skills
We set up roots in a Cypress Hills
Left from York as an exportee
Now him return you'll be calling deportee
Bad Boy have fi run things here
A nuff bad man live in a foreign
Bad Boy, them a run things deh
A nuff bad man live in a foreign

Remember way back when when Rasta had no friends
