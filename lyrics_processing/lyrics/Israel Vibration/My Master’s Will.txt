Don't know what is going to bring
You see I give thanks, come what may
Of my missal master, I should thankfully receive
Ain't gonna sit down here crying, worrying going on free
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, yet is good to share when you trying to help someone else
Never see the breeze behind the air
You couldn't hold who you calling for and there's nothing you can do
Everything is a one world's often view
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, yet is good to share, but it's nice to help someone else
Bring the bread, a sip of tea, a fish for you and a fish for me
I guess there's nothing you can do, everything is a one world's often view
It's my master's will, I see the sun shining today
Don't know what is going to bring
You see I give thanks, come what may
Of my missal's master I shall thankfully receive
Ain't gonna sit down here, crying, worrying on free
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, yet is good to share, and it's nice to help someone else
