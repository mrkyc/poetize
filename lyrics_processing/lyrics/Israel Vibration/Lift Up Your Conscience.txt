God hears your sighs and counts your tears
God will lift up, God will lift up
Lift up your head
(God will lift up your head)
He will lift your head
(God will lift up your head)
God will lift up your head
(God will lift up your head)
Lift up your head
(God will lift up)
He will lift up, He'll lift up your head
Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command
Then shall we wandering on His way
Know how wise, how strong
How wise and how strong
(God will lift up your head)
Strong is His hand
(God will lift up your head)
How wise and how strong
(God will lift up your head)
How strong is His hand
(God will lift up)
Yeah, He'll lift up your head
Through waves and clouds and storms
He gently clears the way
Wait, 'cause in His time, so shall this night
Soon end in joy
(Soon end in joy)
Soon end in joy
(Soon end in joy)
Soon end in joy
(Soon end in joy)
Soon end in joy
(Soon end in joy)
God will lift up your head
(Soon end in joy)
God will lift up your head
(Soon end in joy)
God will lift up your head
(Soon end in joy)
God will lift up your head
(God will lift your head)
God will lift up your head
(God will lift up your head)
God will lift up your head
(God will lift up your head)
God will lift up your head
(God will lift up your head)
God will lift up your head
(God will lift up)
God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
Hope and be undismayed
