Slow down, lil nigga, boy, you movin fast
Got the old school whip, with the paper tags
I just dripped on your bitch, and it made you mad
Fuck her for a bag, all I do is splash
All I do is splash, all I do is splash
Sippin drank, rollin planes, puffin with the gass
You broke, got no guap, that shit make me laugh
Get up off your ass, all I do is splash

Had to slow down on that nonsense, I ain't with it
Bout that money, had to stack it and get it, fill that safe with them Benjamans
We rollin up, and take 'm to the face
Born to win the race, more on ya, inside smell like California
Blowin strong right in front the boys
I worked hard to get where I'm at, so Imma show it off
Leave the club drunk, cameras goin off
Pockets overflowin, all my niggas on that never goin broke
Spend one night with your girl, give her back, then you wonder why I'm so loud
Rollin with the gang, you rollin up them plains, but you told them you don't even smoke

Slow down, lil nigga, boy, you movin fast
Got the old school whip, with the paper tags
I just dripped on your bitch, and it made you mad
Fuck her for a bag, all I do is splash
All I do is splash, all I do is splash
Sippin drank, rollin planes, puffin with the gass
You broke, got no guap, that shit make me laugh
Get up off your ass, all I do is splash

What you smokin out? a fuckin pass?
What you smokin boy, it's fuckin trash
You should really go and give it back
It's Sauce, and I ain't shootin crafts
Born waitin for the pretty winny
In the sauce, boy, I'm really swimmin
And this flavor, got it all on me
I'm with the Taylors, Wiz the homie
They my brothers, fuck with me, they gonna cut ya
Fuck with Sauce Twins, I'll shoot ya
Drippin splash, out my Ruger
Took your bitch, now you boo hooin
You's a lame, boy, you a loser

Slow down, lil nigga, boy, you movin fast
Got the old school whip, with the paper tags
I just dripped on your bitch, and it made you mad
Fuck her for a bag, all I do is splash
All I do is splash, all I do is splash
Sippin drank, rollin planes, puffin with the gass
You broke, got no guap, that shit make me laugh
