Fire-engine red, been a part of the family for years
I was sixteen, it was my turn
Four on the floor an' I had learn
So my brother took me out to teach me how to shift those gears
With a tear in his eye, he handed me the keys
Says: "Truck's got quite a history
"Over the years it's been really good to me."
"There's been a lotta tail on the tailgate
"Bumpin' on the bumper
"Steam on the windows: ain't no wonder
"There's dents in the hoods, an' the shocks ain't good
"Swingin' from the rollbars, dancin' in the bed:
"I seen a bunch of gorgeous country corn-fed
"Girls an' a few other things I can't say:
"There's been a lotta tail on the tailgate
"Oh, that's right, oh."
Got a grille guard, foglights
Custom paint an' every Friday night
I'm trollin' down Main Street showin' off the new chrome wheels
We take a rough ride (Rough ride.)
Down a dirt road (Down a dirt road.)
To my Grandaddy's farm an' we unload
An' drove, the doors wide open an' crank up the stero
It's better than a club or a honky-tonk
An' we can hang out just as long as we want
I think I undertsand what my brother was talkin' about
