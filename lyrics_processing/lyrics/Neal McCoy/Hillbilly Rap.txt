Whoah, listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed
A poor mountaineer, he kept his family fed
And then one day, he was shootin' at some food
An' up through the ground come a bubblin' crude
(A bub-bub-bubblin' crude.)
Bub-bub-bub-bubblin' crude

We-we-well, the first thing you know, old Jed's a millionaire
The kinfolk said: "Jed, move away from there."
He said: "California is the place you oughta be."
So they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly
(B-B-B-Beverly.)
B-B-B-Beverly

I said a hip hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a-you don't stop the rock it
To the bang, bang boogie
Say up jumped the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
See I am wonder mike and I brought two friends along
And next on the mike is my man, Hank
C'mon, Hank, sing that song
Check it out, I'm the c-a-s-an-the-o-v-a
And the rest is f-l-y
You see, I go by the name of Casanova
For these reasons, I'll tell ya why
I said a, hotel motel holiday inn
I say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take the friend
