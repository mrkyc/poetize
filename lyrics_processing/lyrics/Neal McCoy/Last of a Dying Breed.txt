Ray was a farm boy, a cowboy an' a banker
A clerk, a roughneck, a driller
A long-haul driver, a soldier an' a mechanic
He was also a friend to everybody he ever met
Ray taught me the value of Faith an' family
The American flag, hard work, honesty an' a good dog
I hope my Daddy Ray wasn't the last of a dyin' breed
He's a cold beer drinker, a buck deer hunter:
The best friend a dog ever had
A post-hole-digger, a mint Skoal dipper
John Deere cap-sportin' man
With a house on a hill and a pond in the field
Surrounded by a mess of corn rows
Makes a livin' from his labour, a credit to the Maker
He's somebody everybody knows
Last of a dying breed who tend the fields and mend the fences
Heaven knows, I'd hate to think that generation might be ending
But if he goes, he will go down in history:
As the last, the last of the:
Overall wearers, farmer tan terrors
Down at the VFW hall. (y'all.)
Cake pan lickers, ripe tomato pickers
Hay balers loadin' trailers in the Fall
Fruit stand sellers, town square dwellers
Who gather at The Dairy Queen at dawn
Everybody knows him an' everybody loves him:
God, I'm gonna miss him if they're gone

Heaven knows, I'd hate to think that generation might be ending
But if he goes, he will go down in history:
As the last, the last of a dying breed
(Last of a dying breed.)
He's a hard-working family man
(Last of a dying breed.)
Last of a dying breed who tend the fields and mend the fences
Heaven knows, I'd hate to think that generation might be ending
