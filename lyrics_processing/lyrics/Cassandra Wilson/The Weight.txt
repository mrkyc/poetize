I just need some place where I can lay my head
I said, "Hey mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook his hand, no was all he said
Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me
I picked up my bag went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the devil they was walkin' side by side
I said, "Hey Carmen, come on let's go downtown"
She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around"
Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me
Go down Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just old Luke, Luke's waitin' on the Judgment Day
"Well, Luke my friend what about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor son
Won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?"
Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me
Put the load right on me

He said, "I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog"
I said, "Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful woman"
He said, "That's okay, but won't you feed him when you can"
Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me
Catch a cannonball now, to take me on down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fannie, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone, yes
Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on
