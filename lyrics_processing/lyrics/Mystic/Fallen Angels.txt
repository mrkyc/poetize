Greetings, yo, it's mystic and this song is for everybody who ever lost anybody
To a violent death - the streets, drugs, domestic violence
Who's gone through the process of the pain, the anger, and then the peace
And unfortunately, you can't ever take all the pain away but sometimes you can get
Further then you thought  for real  believe me, this is for all the fallen angels

When your body hit the concrete, I couldn't help but scream
Blood fowing fluid, life is but a dream
'Til a bullet takes your last breath, where the angel slept
You were received comfortably and the heavens wept
Man you threw me for a loop, had me questioning exitstance
Like why I'm still living and do angels give kisses?
Cause sometimes in the middle of the night
I can feel you by my side saying let's ride
So I hug myself a little stronger, bring the pain closer
Get mad at the world then once again regain composure
Closure, can't seem to find that these days
Seems like everywhere I look, another soldier's laid
My love you looked so peaceful wanted to give you two breaths
Pump five times on your chest to break the silence that you left
Instead I paid respects, caressed your cold face
Whispered you know I'll always love you with amazing grace

Fallen angels in the sky
Why must all the soldiers die?
I wanna know, I got to know
Fallen angels in the sky
Why must all the soldiers die?
I wanna know, I got to know

Sometimes you visit in my dreams, I wake up in a sweat
Trying to, catch my breath, clutching on my breast
Best believe your're not forgotten, those sweet memories
Gem of a G, guess those busters couldn't see
Lord please forgive them for they know not what they take
Raised the stakes, twisted fate tell me who gonna take the weight
Patiently meditate, I sense your aura in my presence
Killed so savagely, still there's beauty in your essence
(I can feel you) you weren't the last, just the first in a succession
Of the many fallen angels I have known, confession
The pain never goes away, it only lessens
The questions never stop, just learn to live in the present
Resilient I got to be so the next breath don't break me
At peace within myself, so no regrets if they should take me


I say prayers for you no matter what the denomination
When I step into a house of god, there's no hesitation
Drop softly to my knees under the flickers from the candles
Try to get a handle, then I speak to you
My love, I hope you're doing fine
Just another day around the way and you were on my mind
Take a moment to relax, gradually fade to black
Give thanks and praises, and then I step back
And softly, I sway silently
Listen, I can hear you say goodbye to me
And it makes me smile, close my eyes and picture you
Pacified for the moment when I'm that close to you
True indeed, I wish you never left
Still you remain in my cypher, it's all in the breath

Being a women is fulfilling all the things
Your mother was too busy raising you, to complete
Being a women is taking all the pain and anguish you've ever felt
And translating it into beauty
Being a women is knowing when you're broken and
Finding the tools to put yourself back together again
Being a women is remembering to love yourself
