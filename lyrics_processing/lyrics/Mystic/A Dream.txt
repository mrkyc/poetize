It's only a dream

I know that gobbled as a child, and got her own
Still he got to bless me too, I been struggling too long
Tryna keep my head up in this hateful world
Always been mama's soldier, never daddy's little girl
I did some fucked up shit, in the name of the game
Before we even call it that, still it's all the same
Shed, blood, sweat, and tears over the years I been scarred
Trace the tracks of my tears, they will show you who I are
Still I, stand strong wit the militant mind
Not no ice cold bitch, that's to easy to find
Try and maintain my mental, as a peaceful place
Still I be ready to die, till I see my mother's face
Got to unlace the rage that I feel
Constant struggle and madness, ain't got to claim to keep it real
True queen, considered twinkle in my eyes
The glide in my step, I bless the world before I die
And tries I might, ain't a damn thang I can do
Just got to hold on until I make it threw
Until I make it threw...

It's only a dream
You might also like
I been dreamin, for so long
What's the meaning, meaning all my life
I been dreamin, for so long
Mama help me, help me make it right

It's long nights I shake, my body starve from anger
Hopin lady luck will hear my wish's
Instead of treatin me like a stranger
And Mr.Death plucks my people one by one
It's a cold world, and i'm one of the last suns
Forever shinin, even when the skys grey
Will I eternally suffer, mama tell me it will be okay
Chains at my window, I just wanna be free
I'm not scared to die, but why must my people bleed
I gotta get somethin it's my destiny
To all wives up in heaven, I say blessin me
Less I be the next fallen angel, tangled in the web
Givin a fuck about nothin, better off dead
But I don't wanna be ill, don't wanna be a woman token
So I rock mics, and spread love just keep hopin
Knowin these rainy days, they can't last forever
Tellin myself,"young world things will only get better"

It's only a dream

Sometimes I get the feelin like i'm all surronded
Wit no way up out the jungle, guess I got to rule and ground me
Drown me in my sorrow's, that should never manifest
Let my??? forever from the deepest depth's
Man, I got the cuts for luck and the scars for freedom
Let the angel's come and get me, I'ma set it off when I see em
This life is such a dirty game
Mama never told me it would be so hard to maintain
So I make the purist devil faceable
The walls up out my mind,and so hard and laceable
Only by sorrow things, I wanna rule the planet
Travel to the ends for mine, like a bandit
Hand it to me, my visions ready to implement
Made it this for, hope bloody bodie's ain't my present
I'ma keep shinin,I got to make it happend
Find my place in the sun where me and my folks can keep laughin

It's only a dream
La,la,la,la,la
