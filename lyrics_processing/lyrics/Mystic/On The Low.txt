He be on that next shit, I be on that flex shit
He be askin' questions, I be cashin' checks in
You know don't wanna let him know, you don't wanna let him go
So we can, we can, we can, we can
Keep it on the low girl (keep it on the low girl)
Keep it on the low, low, low
Nobody gotta know girl (nobody gotta know girl)
Keep it on the low, low, low
We can keep it on the low

Keep it on the DL, they don't need no details
Hop up in the V12, we ain't tryna see 12
Swervin' through the lanes 'cause stuntin' is a habit
All I ever needed was this money and a bad bitch
You fuckin' with a savage, your nigga he just average
Remember I ain't have shit, but now I'm in my bag bitch
Money on my mind, go ahead and check the CAT scan
Say you're on your grind, then girl give me a lap dance
Bring it back, bring it back for a stack now
Leave that lame ass nigga in the background
Runnin' up a check, I'ma flex and count this dough
We freakin' freakin' freakin' freakin', freakin' on the low

He be on that next shit, I be on that flex shit
He be askin' questions, I be cashin' checks in
You know don't wanna let him know, you don't wanna let him go
So we can, we can, we can, we can
Keep it on the low girl (keep it on the low girl)
Keep it on the low, low, low
Nobody gotta know girl (nobody gotta know girl)
Keep it on the low, low, low
We can keep it on the low

I can't be there right beside you but I promise I'll be close, yeah
Neck and wrist on glow, whole lot of water, let's rock the boat
Heard you been talkin' to your friends but don't you do that shit no more, look
Cold hearted shit, flood my shit out with VV's
I'ma ice tray the gang before I buy a wedding ring
Know you off now with your nigga, don't gotta explain' nothin' to me
Baby I'm just your side nigga, you can go and come as you please, look
Ride it, ride it, ride it, I won't tell nobody
Send me videos of your body but he got your page on private
Fuck it, I'ma get inside it while I'm covered up in diamonds
Know exactly what you doin', no way around it, don't be childish, fuck

He be on that next shit, I be on that flex shit
He be askin' questions, I be cashin' checks in
You know don't wanna let him know, you don't wanna let him go
