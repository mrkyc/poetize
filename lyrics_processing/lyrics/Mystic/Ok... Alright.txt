And capturing minds?
Well here's a youth call
From my block niggas to suburban kids
I know this world weighs heavy on your low-set lids
This is for dark nights
And sharp blades
For mountains of pain on your tear-stained face
This is for every time they beat you
Every time they lied
Every time you suffered
Every time you cried
This is for broken dreams
Shattered with precision
Misunderstood visions
Lives christened in prison
Dismissed 'em
You were never meant to understand
Tag on every wall and kiss the sky when you can
Fam' formation
Work them
They'll trace the outline of your soul when you desert them
You might also like'Cus they don't know the trouble that you've seen
Who cares tonight? Life is but a dream
It's gonna be ok... (ok)
Alright
Free your mind (ok) if only for the night
It's gonna be ok... (ok)
Alright
You don't have to cry tonight
You (you) shall (shall) prevail
Best 'ta free your mind
'Fo they bleed you like the rest
With guns and daggers
Just a slow solid death
While breathlessly awaitin' for the world to evolve
It's not gonna happen if you hemmed against the walls
Of your own design, they cross all space and time
Who caused the vision? Who drew the lines?
Finding it hard to breathe, got bruises on their knees
From praying to leave, please
Conceiving ways to escape the venom
The biggest fight is for your life, it's for the next gen
Defend 'em
The rules, bend 'em
Cause they gon' keep attending
Every breath you take is worthless
All endings, no beginnings
Bells ringing (ring ring ring)
No need to read braille
You (you) shall (shall) prevail
Ok... (ok)
Alright
Free your mind (ok) if only for the night
Gonna be ok... (ok)
Alright
You don't have to fight tonight
(They don't know the troubles that you've seen)
Cuts for luck and scars for freedom
They will never feel your pain
So you'll defeat them
World in your eyes
Ready to fly
You must make it through the next day to feed them
Feelin' used and abused
Quite confused
It's really all about you and the way you wanna move
Those chains that seem to bind you
Let me remind you
The power's in the people
Every moment's perfect timing
You visualize death
Now visualize your life
You looked into the dark
Now look into the light
(Now look into the light)
'Cus they don't know the trouble that you've seen
Who cares tonight? Life is but a dream
It's gonna be ok... (ok)
Alright
Free your mind (ok) if only for the night
It's gonna be ok... (ok)
Alright
Let your light shine tonight
