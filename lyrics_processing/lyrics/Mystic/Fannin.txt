They be fannin when they see me
They be fannin when they see me
They be fannin when they see me
Haters talking down but I know they wanna be me
They be fannin when they see me
They be fannin when they see me
They be fannin when they see me
Riding through the city, got my whole team with me

When I show up, yea, you know it's about to go down;
Pocket full of money just for a youngin to throw around
Mo' rounds, tell the waitress to bring more bottles
Fuck it while she at it tell her to bring out more models
Get the club lit, turn up in public
Hammer time with it, girl you know you can't touch this
One sip, got you acting like you buzzed now
Lame niggas strikeout, real niggas touchdown
Yea girl, you know I'm a star
When the crew roll through, yea you know who we are
Bring your friends to the table while you over by the bar
Come through to the crib, catch a Uber tomorrow
Game on lock, they just looking for the cheat code
Balling with no money lil homie that's a free throw
Fly young player make it look easy
Prolly why yo girl fannin when she see me

Whole team with me, mobb Depp like the duo
I'm way up homie you can find me on Pluto
Every time we step in yea you know we about to turn up
If they rolling up trees yea to know we about to burn up
Hold up, hold up you know what it is
Fixin to  find one in the club, then I take it to the crib
Then I show her how I live then I show her how we do
If she down for the kid, then she down for the crew
Oh, yea girl you know I'm nasty with it
And we know you a freak, you acting classy with it
And I'm chasing after the money like a athlete with it
Watch this money disappear like I'm magic with it
They see me making moves while they just trynna to catch up and they fanin when they see me cause they know I got next up
Fly young Playa, make it look easy
Prolly why your girl fannin when she see me
