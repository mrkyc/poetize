Uh, uh, uh

Now don't push me away (Opposition)
'Cause when the first time I met you, girl, you shook me in ways (You had me shook up)
You knew the life, a nigga's cookin' up yay (The ballers)
And plus, you knew the pitfalls and the tumbles of the game (The industry)
You've seen the spotlight, watch niggas crumble to the fame (So crazy)
And all the time you tried to tell me to stay humble and maintain (You'd tell me, "Cool out")
When I was like lets go half on a baby (Let's have a kid)
And if not, let's just go half on a 'Cedes (Mercedes)
Drop-top coupe while we pumpin' "Sweet Sadie" (Cherry red)
Flyin' up Lennox, doin' us, pushin' 80 (Harlem)
The road trips, the late nights got you pissed (I'm workin')
The road trips, the late nights got us rich (I'm grindin')
The clothes that we wear, the place that we piss (We ballin')
Where we get to shop, what we ate, what we sip (Clicq, Cristal)
So if I don't get a chance to tell you (Nah)
Not too often lately, girl, how your hand's so helpful (Believe me)
In this cold world girl, every man needs help, too (I ain't trippin')
So, baby, I'ma ride and no plans to fail you (Stick with me)

I had enough of the shucking and jiving, duckin' and hidin'
I'm tryin' to get to conversatin' and ridin' (Well)
'Cause I'm feelin' your essence
Your presence is just enough to let me know that it's destined (Oh, girl)
And since the day that I found you
Something about you makes me want to lose it and pounce ya (Pounce)
But it's not just your body
It's your mind, your spirit, everything combined (Hm)
And while I got a chance (Yeah), take my hand
Let me show you something real, that love you can feel (Yeah)

Now two years done passed (Long time), few cheers, few laughs (Uh-huh)
Coppin' Vs, shoppin' sprees, gear's in the bags (Ballin')
And who cares who's mad (Fuck what they say)
'Cause most the bitches say you was there for the cash
And I ain't scared of your past (Nope), I'm prepared for the future (Right)
The one thing I ask, just don't tear a nigga coupe up (Don't crash the car)
You brang me bail when I was caged up (Good lookin')
And back and forth to court 'til the lawyer nailed the case shut (I fucks with you)
You found the numbers in my phone, you was in my face, but (My bad)
You know what they say, them break ups to make ups (I ain't goin' nowhere)
And I admit, I'm getting better with the flirtin' (I'm tryin')
You know you dead sexy when you yellin' and you cursin' (Sexy)
You such a hell of a person
So when I get home I'm gonna tell you in person (Just me and you), shit
Face-to-face, I'ma run base to base
Then slide home safe until I make your body shake (Climax)
You tell me every night that life comes with a twist (So smart)
I'm in the spotlight and that I'm runnin' the risk (I know)
And you always say, "Love don't come with a kiss" (I don't understand)
It's hard soakin' up game when it's comin' from a bitch (True spills)
But where's my manners? Never take you for granted (Nope)
Never take you advantage (Nope), most people don't understand it (I fuck with you)
Is you happy? Lil' inside humor (Ha-ha)
When you and I together, what the fuck they gonna do with us? (Nothin')
Say a prayer 'cause we destined for glory (That's right)
And when the credits roll, it's Harlem's West Side Story (Cribs)
My vision of the lovin' is close
That's how I want us to be when we doin our thing (Well)
Kissin' ya, lickin' ya, touchin' ya, rubbin' ya
Tell me how you want me to bring it (Oh, yeah)
Because I know he got limits, well, baby, I don't
And my feelings they won't
Let you get away from me, come stay with me
Baby, baby, please

Baby don't push me away (When the sunshine)
When the sunshine turn to rain
Baby I can take away your pain (I can take away your pain)
Just call me up when you need some time (Yeah)

You don't have to settle for less
And, baby, I can give you what you want (I can give you what you want)
Just call me up when you need some time
And you can get it from me just like, "Daddy, come on"
