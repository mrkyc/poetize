I'ma cold soul in a hard body
Heatmakerz, Crack Music

Yeah, everything seem drama related
Comma after comma, them commas my favorite
Just sign it and date it
All I ever wanted to say was, "Look mama, I made it"
Look mama, I made it
Look mama, I made it
That crack rock, used to cut it and shave it
That was after I bathed it, look mama, I made it

When I saw the syringe, I swore I would cringe, mommy
Gone off the binge, daddy beat the doors off the hinge
It felt like God was recordin' my sins
To play 'em back in my dreams to make sure I saw 'em again
I can't afford no more friends, I can't afford no more losses
I've dropped bags at the jewelers, spent forty on crosses
I was down on my chips and I was still at the dealer
I put bricks in my wrist so I can feel like a dealer
I'm a cold soul in a hard body
Roll dolo in a wide body (Get 'em)
They snatched the gang, they tryna charge 'em with a John Gotti
Another three, they goin' down for an armed robbery (Woo-woo)
It's all facts, I can't tell a lie (Can't tell a lie)
I pray to God 'cause he told me that the devil lies (Uh huh)
Called my jeweler then he told me that my bezel cries
Drop my top so I can pray up to my heaven skies

I'm goin' overseas, I hope little mama can make it (Damn)
I left her naked, told her meet me on the runway (Runway)
When we comin' back? I only booked a one-way (Please)
Why you askin' questions? You the one I chose to come play (Come on)
Besides, who else gon' get you Chick-Fil-A on a Sunday (Who else?)
They touched the don, it's dawn, locin', gunplay
I touch ya moms, that's word to moms, some say (What?)
Lost both my niggas, same circumstance
I was thrivin' through pain (Bloodshed, Huddy 6)
Outside with the stick on me (Who want it?)
Wait, I ain't got no one to blame
That would drive you insane
I would drive in the rain
Body twenty-five, I still get twenty-five wit' a thang
No more quarters, doggie, that's the price of them thangs
Side or whole bird, I ain't got time to be slicin' no wings
