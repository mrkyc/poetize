Shout outs to Taft where them killas is made (10th Ave.)
We was out on the ave., young, dealin' that yay (Early)
Tryin' to get cash, pumpin' crills to get paid (The dimes)
Alcohol in my glass, blunt filled up with haze (That purple)
We congregate in front them grocery stores (Ahki, what's up?)
Sellin' crack, held gats and conversate while we smoked the raw (Pass that)
And sit on crates like they La-Z-Boys (Move over)
Distribute weight like the '80s, boy (No doubt)
And whip up 8th in the latest toy (You see that?)
Like it's the only thing to do (Uh-huh)
You know them house parties, bro, you had to bring your crew (Posse deep)
And you know we stay fly, Pelle leather with the boots (Stay fly)
And niggas shake the dice and call your bet out 'fore you shoot (What you got?)
You lookin' scared, money, fall better to the deuce (Fall better)
We would set up on the stoop, gettin' wet up on the stoop (Twisted)
And watch the dust fiends gettin' wet up off the juice
Tryin' to get up off that loot (Uh-huh) so we could get up on the coupes (It's done)

I wish Harlem Week was still around (Nine-one)
You know the jam packed traffic, buggin' out in front of Willie's Lounge (Crazy)
I been doing this since Nucleus was open (19th Street)
Coppin' they black, well, who knew what we was smokin'?
Took a few pulls, had you movin' slow motion (Sky high)
Walkin' past the Carter, now is Pookie still smokin'?
And I could still picture the sports bar (Uh-huh)
Niggas think they hot shit whippin' up in the sports car
The State Building jams (Right)
Remember Farrakhan had that fake Million Man? (Bad turnout)
Copped the fly jackets from Carlos at the mall (Two-fifth)
Or be in Kingdome's poppin' bottles in the park (Foster)
Don't play on 40th, 'cause they'll rob you after dark (Lenox)
Wolf Pack Gang, don't jog Central Park (East side)
F-T-W, fuck the world (Fuck it)
Drinkin' forties got us fucked up 'til we 'url (Twisted)
In this hustler's world (Harlem)

This ain't Queens, homie, you surrounded by deadly grounds (This ain't Queens)
And I was downtown just watchin' the 'caine flip (Taft)
Heard a nigga from the west side was fuckin' my same bitch (No names)
But them bitches didn't care (Nope)
Just tryin' to get some cash, buy some sneakers, fix they hair (For the come up)
Ride up Lenox Ave., you smell the reefer in the air (40th)
3rd Ave., viva Puerto Rico, the Boricua fair
African parade every year the whole block is there (7th)
You want raw yay? Broadway, you go cop it there (45th), shit
And we can cruise autobahn (Ride), go buy the rawest chron'
Around the clock, baby, even four in the morn' (Twenty-four hours)
This summertime we still illin' on 'em, God (Mm)
We'll clear the whole 7th, poppin' wheelies on them squads (Comanches)
