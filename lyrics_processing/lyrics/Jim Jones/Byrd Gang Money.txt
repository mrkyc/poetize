Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money (Ghetto two)

Reminiscing on my first slant (Two)
By the time, I was sipping on my first Schlitz (High school)
Hit the game, I started as a look-out (Yeah)
See the fly cars that the big wheelies pushed out (Ah-ha)
Dirt bikes popping wheelies by the cookout (Double facts)
That was that summer I was thirst to be plumper (Yeah)
It pays better but the risk was worst
Save the fly leather copping kicks with the work
It didn't work, I was fucked up the re-up (Damn)
Bottles at the tunnel, that was '98, I called papa for the bundles (Lies)
An easy ten grand (Yeah), it felt like a hundred (Uh)
These Gucci belts by the stomach, with guns in them (Say, what?)
It's only wealth that we want, if we run wit 'em (That's right)
'Till the death, until the feds come and get 'em (Fuck 'em)
Byrd gang money (Yeah), it started off that Byrd Kane Money (Aw)
New cars, in that third lane money

Just clean my fancy car (A new Ferrari)

Only real niggas spending that Byrd gang money (Yeah, aw)

Getting money is the hardest (Hardest)
Your first hundred grand is a job
Your first cool million, you're an artist (You're dead)
Especially if the niggas up the block, sell garbage (Garbage)
Told it, crumbles all apart when you hold it
Wasn't naturally born a crook, I was molded
Drugs kept my uncles in the green, so I sold it (Sold it)
Even learned to smell a good grade through the packing
Headed Midwest and got financial backing
Started networking with the wheelies on credit
Any concepts of being robbed that was debited
Anybody get it, don't come a day later with the eigth money
Got to play it out, 'cause I said it
Courts an acquittal, coming in the club with an entourage
Me, I'm the boss in the middle (Woo)
The brain and the bran, Roc-a-House dope around the neck
A lot of letters for the chain, and the charm (Uh, uh)
Come on, man
Just clean my fancy car (Yeah-yeah)
Picked up my fancy clothes (Ah-ha)
And we only in the hot spot
No, we got the bomb
We got the bomb (Yeah)
This is Byrd gang money, yeah (Byrd gang)
This is Byrd gang money (Byrd gang)
This is Byrd gang money (Yeah)
Only niggas spending that Byrd gang money

At a young age, no bricks just grams (Two-four-five)
Nigga stuck, then your man's a flip (Get 'em)
The situation real, then your man's a hit (Twice)
You slow on the get-a-way, then can you get it (Damn)
You circle the block, you play track and field
A lot of real niggas on that track got killed (VIP)
But you know me forever manning up
Never sit down when I pee, forever standing up (Mobbin')
I'm a boss, so I'm calling the shots
Big homie, pioneer of the block
Now I trill with an pump, nigga, I'll tell you when and where at
Don't face-fight, I'm not the one to stare at (Don't do it)
Matter of fact, dawg, you and your man sits
In the back off cop car, dog, pointing your index (Still is)
I guess you could, 'cause you a Sammy the Bull
But somebody gonna die if a hammer get pulled
Just clean my fancy car
Picked up my fancy clothes
And we only in the hot spot
No, we got the bomb
We got the bomb
This is Byrd gang money, yeah
