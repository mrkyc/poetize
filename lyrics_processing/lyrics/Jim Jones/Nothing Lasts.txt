But I, I could always hear a voice in the back of my head
No matter what type of wrong I was doin'
(Heatmakerz)
(Crack Music)
Funny, right?
That's how life goes sometimes
Set

So as the stars shine down on us (Real bright)
New Rollie as the time wind down on us (Ticket)
Hit the club, skip line with the pound on us (Woah)
You can hear the shots flyin' from around the corner (Loud)
Preacher said we should count every minute (Pray for me)
Microwave, I cook up an ounce in a minute (What you need?)
I was way more into money than I'm into fame (That's a fact)
I was prayin' for the summers when the winter came (July shit)
Lord knows it be somethin' 'bout the warm weather (What?)
I just lost 4K on a foreign better (Step back)
I was playin' two games like a doubleheader (Woo)
Jewish lawyers to retain, case they come and get us (Uh)
I put up numbers in the spellin' bee (Shoot)
Where I'm from, everyone was tryna sell a key (Harlem)
I was one wrong move from a felony
I could hear mama now, what she was tellin' me

Let's ride the highs and lows
See where this thing goes
Will it bring us back together?
It always makes me sad
So I try hard to forget
Nothing's gonna last forever

It's just different
No more niggas like us, cloth discontinued
No more servin' that, had to switch the menu
No more in and out of jail, just a bitch or venues
No time for a square 'less I Richie M you, uh
One-fifty on the wrist, not the time though
Cover it in ice, where the time go?
They be comin' after me all the time, yo
Yeah, I'm the tequila, not the lime, ho
I'm paid in full and I'm booked
And when I'm back, I'ma show you how the Cullinan look
Don't nothin' last forever, heard bull on the hook
Still goin' cray on 'em like a colorin' book, yeah
Forever flow, can't kill me, they tried it
I came with the fire, never Billy and Ja'd it
They stealin' drip, hear my story be weak
Yo, I swear I hate you little niggas more than Tariq
Let's ride the highs and lows
See where this thing goes
Will it bring us back together?
It always makes me sad
So I try hard to forget
Nothing's gonna last forever

If you just say no, what are you gonna say yes to?
We say yes to education
We say yes to dedication
We climb up to a higher station
A new spirit of motivation
