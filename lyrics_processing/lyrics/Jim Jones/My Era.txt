Right about this time, I'd like to say a prayer for everyone out there
Bow your heads
Twelve sinners all around the world
Pray for y'all
I can dig it, uh-huh
Pray for me, I pray for you
I even pray for my enemies too, you heard?
Where I'm from, we don't live long
The good die young
Where you from?

Where I'm from
It still get cold in the summertime and dark in the daytime
Where I'm from
I seen all the toughest niggas fold and I swear it didn't take time
I watched niggas go and change, did in no time
They gon' try and throw shade so we don't shine
We gon' buy forty Rollies for the old time
They don't wanna see us shine, we don't pay 'em no mind, yeah

We got fresh watchin' the Dapper Dan era
I'm from that come up short, smack you and your man era
Runnin' 'round, a thousand grams inside a hundred grand Carrera
Rockin' two G's, a couple grand on the sweater, uh
Add 'em up, these is Gucci mathematics (Breathe)
To get some fresh airs, I want pump like an asthmatic, no cap (Breathe, nigga)
I'm just runnin' down a list of things
I hit the jeweler, I got the watch and gotta get the ring (Facts)
I'm still flyin' through Harlam, you think the whip had wings (Woo)
And everybody got the throne until they hit the 'caine (Boom)
That nigga speakin' malice
But he so valid, he send out hits like Khaled (We the Best)
Shit, they take his top off in that Maybach
Forgive me, God, don't let me say that (Chill)
But Lord knows I been to hell, I'm on my way back (I'm comin')
I'm ridin' dirty in that foreign for that payback

I'm from that rope chain, cocaine, the crack era
TNT came, we tossed out packs era
Took money, ski mask, them gloves was black leather
Friends dead, RIP on the wall with black letters, ayy
Lord forgive us, nobody prepared all us
On the road to riches, a cell what's waitin' for us
At court, hopin' somebody came with bail for us
'Fore them warrants popped up, they try to leave us locked up
Red light green, them G's was yellin' go
Idolize dope dealers, bought Beamers off sellin' blow (Yeah)
Runnin' up the bread, my business was gettin' more (Word)
'Til they see me come through in black coupes with yellow hoes
I'm a god in my ghetto, beat odds in my ghetto
Spinned blocks, threw shots, survived wars in my ghetto (Yeah)
Kept it on me like I glued my palm to the metal
You can't call God when you fuck with the wrong devil (Let's go)
They underrated my greatness
Anti-lame, I'm not related to fake shit
Took a vow never to live broke, we stay rich
Bed-Stuy fly, where young killers go apeshit (Yeah)

Yeah, I'm from
And dark in the daytime, ooh

Swear it didn't take time, no
Did in no time
Shade so we don't shine
For the old times
