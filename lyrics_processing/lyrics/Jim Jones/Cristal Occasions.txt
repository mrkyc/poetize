Heatmakerz, Crack Music
I'm in a whole different pace now
I was just on Lenox
Called up the ho, I told that bitch I'm on 8th now
Jones

Tap dance kid (Facts)
Singing in the rain, I'm from where they caught bids
From slinging all the 'caine (True)
Yeah we say we kings but every king done got slain (King)
My man caught life from bringing them things up to Maine (True story)
I'm only here to say (Right), what most of y'all scared to say (Scared to say)
I pop up at my show and take a layaway (We outta here)
Faith in God, I said my prayers today (As-Salaam-Alaikum)
All jokes aside
I done stood up in the kitchen where the coke got fried
I pour liquor the same spot where my bros done died
I told that bitch "I'm chilly, ho", I'm cold inside (Cold, ho)
The watch? All froze inside
I used to trap up in the spot and I would doze inside (Woo)
Now I jump up out that spot, I got that Rolls outside

Greetings and salutations (Greetings)
Where I'm from, every night's a Cristal occasions (Cheers)
Where, shit, you better duck, them pistols is waving (Boom, boom)
Sold drugs 'cause I couldn't watch my mama slaving (Mama, what's up?)
All this money turn into shopping habits (Fuck it)
Can't go to the dealer, coppin' a drop's a habit (I need that, too)
I was telling this bitch that I got lots of habits (You heard me, bitch)
Like hopping on jets, jumping off yachts a habit (Capo)
You might also like
Since protocol is already established (Uh-huh)
They say their made men and was never established (Never)
We only get scared when it's Feds on the badges
Baby girl said that her head was like magic
Make the whole dick disappear
Once I fuck, I'm like "Yuck, I wish this bitch disappear" (Bitch outta here)
One button I could switch different gears (Vroom-vroom)
And when I wave the diamonds in my wrist is clear (Woo)
I'm talking spring water with electrolytes (Oh, that's clear)
Make sure that water's boiling when you chef the white (What's the temperature?)
My man got knocked out of town, they tryna extradite
When I go, my name, they better put it next to lights
So I can shine like when them stars on the line (Facts)
Five foreign cars parked on the line
I used to play the park until the fiends form a line (Line)
Gucci sweatsuits, we never did the formal kind (Uh)
Maybe if there's a court appearance (Where my lawyer at?)
The dealer gave me a deal, I bought the Porsche on clearance (We outta here)
Shipped that new Targa on a discount
And when that work come back, now that's a dismount (Dismount)
