Girl come a little closer (closer)
You know the world is getting colder (colder)
I can't tell you how I feel now (feel now)
So let me show you some real now (real now)

I ain't stressin' over my old girl
You done played by old girls
Swear to god that news old girl
When you step out its like woah girl
Uh, and we had fun while our time passed
Fast forward time lapse
You cryin' lookin' at your time lapse
You to good to cry with your fine ass
He don't make time for your fine ass
When I'm locked up in the studio
Workin' overtime setting newer goals
You sittin', trippin', wishin', what is this I thought you different
Impossible to cruise smooth
Thought you knew my mission
Look, I'm working hard putting hours in (putting hours in)
Spend a check when I was in (when I was in)
Ain't got to worry if I'm faithful I be here if I enable
I'm the realest thing that came through

You hate the lies and I know that
Sick and tired well it shows bad
You deserve the truth and you owed that
It's the price you pay if you goin' ask
Look, you're the champ of pain drinking champagne
Insane with your little frame
Goin' insane about my little fame
Big leagues, fifth seas
Now we don't play little games
Still me you'll see
Promise I won't ever change
You love the fact that I'm still the same
It's what you get with the realist babe
Discussin' girls that I didn't date
I'm gettin' paid just to entertain
Look, my queen knows how to deal now (how to deal now)
She didn't get it until now (until now)
Hatin' hoes she wanna kill now
Little mama just chill out
You the real one I feel now
