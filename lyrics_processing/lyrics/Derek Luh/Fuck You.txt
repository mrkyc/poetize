Yeah
I'll admit it's love at first fight
A lie sound good if you speak it right
You hate the fact I'd rather party with the liquor
Stumble in, 4AM, don't know how to whisper
You got me on my knees like it's a Sunday
I told you that I'll quit you maybe one day
Got me feeling so lovey with a numb face
I'm never turning back so let's run away

Ooh
Baby you don't know what you do
Every time I try leave and cut loose
I end up coming back again
Yeah I'm back again

I wanna say fuck you
I wanna say fuck you
Wait I didn't mean that, let's restart
Always keep it real when I go too far
I wanna say fuck you
I wanna say fuck you
You're so spoiled, you get what you want
Yeah you're right even when you're wrong
I wanna say

Where's a Bonnie go without her Clyde
You always catch me slippin' on you Jerry Rice
Oh you wanna spell it out, who you Vanna White
This shit is C-R-A-Z, can I buy a Y
You working on my nerves like it's a Monday
Damn, that body curvy like the letter J
I'm dealing with a cough, you could medicate
Mix it with a sprite for the stomach ache

Ooh
Baby you don't know what you do
Every time I try leave and cut loose
I end up coming back again
Yeah I'm back again

I wanna say fuck you
I wanna say fuck you
Wait I didn't mean that, let's restart
Always keep it real when I go too far
I wanna say fuck you
I wanna say fuck you
You're so spoiled, you get what you want
Yeah you're right even when you're wrong
I wanna say
I wanna say fuck you
I wanna say fuck you
I wanna say
I wanna say fuck you
