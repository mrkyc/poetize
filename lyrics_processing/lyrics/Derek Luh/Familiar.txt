Expensive dinners, expensive women
They tempo men on with their feelings, I know the feeling
It's overfilling can't reveal it, it feels familiar
And she could get it if she with it
Then I'm fuckin' with her, I'm fuckin' with her

You back that stadium she's what I'm looking forward to
We expect a few to support the crew we flee me some more of you
Pick a different skiddy yeah every city that im touring through
She say she don't do this much I'm bringing out the whore in you
Where you going we got more to do
Ridin' to the day stool
Making stack to pay my crew
Spend it on a ladies shoe
But I ain't about to play the fool
Charge for instrumental man slaughter think I made it too

I swear I love this music
You're the fame in the cash
She see the rocks on her felly
Get your thang in that dash
Need a pain in your past
My momma say she love me
I'm a pain in the ass
Got the game from my dad
Keep the safe it to pay
Secrets of my past
My own sister talking shit
I guess the game did obey
Ye ain't need get the mecs
Getting paid to ladies tracks
Keep a lady in the pass
You whip Mercedes with her back
And every time I make a mash she throw a fifty 'take me back'
I ain't never talking shit, I'm just quick at state these facts
One o five for a plate
Five one in some steak cause I know I saw it take
