Yeah, It's LA Con, D Luh
What's up J Cuse, Yeah

Flow so infectious make these labels want to sign us (Sinus)
Snap it for a second feel our presence we the flyest
DMX to BMX we all Ruff Riding
See you flex the Puffy chest, we all get excited
Acting like he nice but with that flex he probably lying
Treating 'Em like some bitches first we wine 'em then we dine 'em
Strip all of they conscious leave them on 
Molly on the molly herb, Polly want a cracker
Probably be mixed, and he got to be dapper
Pardon me Dolly, so I heard you want this rapper
Life got tough I tried to flush it down the crapper
That kind of shows what kind of man I am God damn i'm 
Stood up to defeat, you can smell all my passion
Passing on these gassing actors worried 'bout they fashion
My style come natural, I kill 'em like assassins
 Hide 'em in they house, i'm concealing thoughts like boobies in a blouse
And i'm killing all these rappers, they like Call Of Duty noobies
Rap they bodies up and leave them somewhere in the boonies
My voice make her wet, you can call me Lil' Tunechi
I'm kicking in the door, Like I been here before
Announcing my presence, yeah you guys like the goonies
A mountain on some fences, yeah we riding like a hooptie
And she wanna snack on me, keep dogging' me as if she Scooby
I'm chillin' with a yellow bone birdie like Snoopie
I know you feel the turbulence, Flying High The Movement
Finally some words again cause we was feeling stupid
And i got that  for you, crack that bottle up and do it
And i don't need to crack the bottle one I been through it
Snorting this and poppin' that acting all foolish
It's kind of like a social thing, Ain't it thats ruthless
See how they do us, take our minds and abuse it
Well I be the first to stand up and lead you through it
Cause i really feel your fucking pain, Yeah I used to do it
I was fucking with them fools, attitude was like screw it
But then I grew up, and gave me life to music
