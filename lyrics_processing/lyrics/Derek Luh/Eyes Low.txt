We only roll, we only roll that fire
That's how we go, that's how we go, we fly
Our eyes are low
Our eyes are low, so high, yeah
We only roll, we only roll that fire
That's how we go, that's how go, we fly
Our eyes are low
Our eyes are low, so high, yeah

Lately I've been trying to get my paper right
I hit that L and I think about what I'm gonna do in life
I got a lot of questions that I need the answer to
Like how I made it off this dirty broken avenue
And I roll one and another one
We'll never stop
Gotta make sure that my music lasts and I'll never die
Gotta make sure that my family fed and my dog's right
I work late shift on my slave shit, I'm up all night
And I got that and I need that, I be so lit
I take four puffs before I pass that cause I rolled it
And I know once I get high, Imma be right there
Taking care of my life, yeah
Living up to the hype, yeah

I roll one, smoke one
Big homie gon' hold some
Pass it back, flea flicker
Got the weed, all we need is liquor
Kicking back with a big bag
Good god, where the zig zags
Whiplash when a spliff pass
Your crusty lips can't hit that
Now Imma need a J for this Cole world
Born Sinner, you know girl, just a Warm Up though I told ya
Take a long drive through these Forest Hills
Exhale to this Lauryn Hill like my weed home grown
Hit my women where they foregin still
I hit Skate where the O at
Matter of fact, where the hoes at
You better know how to roll that
Hardest speech you better hold back
You better rip don't fold that
We only roll, we only roll that fire
That's how we go, that's how we go, we fly
Our eyes are low
Our eyes are, low so high, yeah
We only roll, we only roll that fire
That's how we go, that's how we go, we fly
Our eyes are low
