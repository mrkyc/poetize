I've had some bad in my days
I never knew someone like you would come my way
To tell the truth, I can't help but be a little afraid
I think your love might be a little too much for me

Now we can get sexual
Girl, I wanna be down every day and night (sugar)
Now we can get sexual
Just as long as you know my sexual capacity
Now we can get sexual
I'm dyin', I'm tryin', I wanna
I'm afraid that your lovin' might be just a little too much for me
(Afraid, might be, too much)

Girl
I've paid the dues, I've made the rules all before
I've seen them beg, I made them plead for more
But I've never seen nothing better babe
I am a little afraid I think your love might be a little too much for me
Yeah! and I say....

Now we can get sexual
Girl, I wanna be down every day and night (sugar)
Now we can get sexual
Just as long as you know my sexual capacity
Now we can get sexual
I'm dyin', I'm tryin', I wanna
I'm afraid that your lovin' might be just a little too much for me
(Afraid, might be, too much)

I just can't handle it
