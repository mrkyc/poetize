Yo, why you wanna play me like that?
Girl...
Girl, every time I see you
You're with a different man
You tell 'em that you love 'em
And then take every thing you can
You're living life in the fast lane
You're no longer daddy's girl
Can't stay with just one man
You gotta love them all around the world
I've got my eye on you
And I know just what you are
You're just an using girl
You drive me like a car
(Chorus)
You're a, money taker and a heartbreaker
You'll never find yourself a true love to hold
You're a money taker and a heartbreaker
Your heart's just too cold
Girl
Time keeps tickin' by you
So you better make up your mind
Won't ya let somebody love you
For more than just one night
You get everything you ask for
So you have no need to steal
We'd all be dead right now
If pretty looks could kill
You might also likeI've got my eye on you
And I know just what you are
You're just a using girl
You drive me like a car
(Chorus)
Girl, I know your fly but tell me why
Must you even try to take what I have earned
Just wait your turn, from what I see
You got a lot to learn about life, being a wife or
Even just being my girl
It's false hype so word up, change your attitude
You gotta learn to show some gratitude
Yeah, I'm on your trip but girl don't flip
Coz I'm hip to the way you trip so just skip
All the fun and games, I know you're a faker
Yo tell em what she is, a money taker
I've got my eye on you
And I know just what you are
You're just a using girl
You drive me like a car
(Chorus)
Yo, the B is not a fool so what do you take me for
You think you're gettin' over, well take a look at the score
Yo 1, 2, 3, yep you're outta here, letting you go
Savin' the rest of my tears, for someone who will
Treat me right like I should be, not tryin' to break my heart
Nor take my money, just like you drove me
Then you been driven', so get out of my life
And get in the hard livin'
(2x)
Money taker and a heart breaker
You'll never find a true love to hold, you're a
Money taker and a heart breaker
