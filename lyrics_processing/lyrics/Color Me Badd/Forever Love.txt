Now here we are
The two of us
And nothing's gonna come between us again
Forever love
I feel you're with me
You're the sun that chases away the rain
Oh
I cherish all the love you bring
It's here forever and a day
I love you more than anything
I can't throw that away
My love

There's nowhere, baby
Unless you're there
I could never let you down
By the way
I have wanted to say
I will always be around
Forever love
Oh, forever love
Baby, oh
You might also like
Inside my heart
You'll never die
You understand the man
That hides deep inside
So come to me
(So come to me)
I need you dearly
(I need you dearly)
I'll never give you reason to say goodbye
(Never say goodbye)
There were times
I made you cry
And times I wasn't there for you
But for our love
I'd even die
(For our love)
For you
I'm gonna stay


You know, girl
Being with you
Is like the meaning of my life
You give me so much happiness
Just to see you smile
Gives me the strength to go on
I cherish all the moments we spend together
The laughter
The tears
They're all so special to me
I guess what I'm really trying to say
Is that I love you
I cherish all the love and rain you bring
I know it
Falling
I love you more than anything
I can't throw that away
(That away)
Ohh

There's nowhere, baby
Unless you'e there
I could never let you down
(I'll never let you down)
By the way
I have wanted to say
(All I wanna do is)
I will always be around
There's nowhere, baby
Unless you're there
(Oh no, no, no)
I could never let you down
You know if you want me
You got me
If you need me
I'll be there
I will always be around
I'll always be around, girl
(Be around)
I'll never let you down
(Be around)
You know I will
For the memory of you
For all the times we shared together
For all we've been through
