When I get down on my luck
I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood
They say, "Ain't what you know but who you know
You need to know someone to know no one"
When I get down on my luck
I roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
Lost some years, I used to know
I know my fate like bullets in a shotgun
When I get down on my luck
I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood
They say, "Ain't what you know but who you know
You need to know someone to know no one"
When I get down on my luck
I roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
Lost some years, I used to know
I know my fate like bullets in a shotgun

She loves to dream
Living in and off and out her mind in space and time
She takes a line and lies her life away
You might just say she stays to go nowhere
Midnight scenes from an old romantic movie
Usually, you'd be there today
I say was different, I can take you with me
Wondering if you wanna go there
You might also like
Down on my luck
Down on my luck

Do you think about the things you say you don't?
And I know you do, uh (Baby, yeah)
White wine and she over cool
Ooh, look at you, look at you
Do you think the things you do or who you know?
'Cause they told you to, yeah (Baby, yeah)
Why you listen to 'em? (Who you know?)
Hands up, middle finger to 'em
(Middle finger to 'em, middle finger to 'em, middle finger to 'em)
(Middle finger to 'em, middle finger to 'em, middle finger to 'em)
Fuck that, get down!
