I just wanna hold you in my arms, oh oh
Oh yeah

All alone by the phone
Waiting on you to call on a busy weekend
Tell me have I seen when
I stayed around, around the town
Waiting on you to tell me what to do
'Cause I'm happy being with you

Touching you, holding you
Is all I really wanna do
(All that I really want)
Day and night I just can't get enough
(Day and night, I can't get enough, yeah)
I want you more, and really need
For you to just believe in me
(For you to just believe in me, yeah)
And I'll be giving you all of my love

It's just a wish on my mind
Hoping you'd have the time
When I wanna see you
For something to hold on to
If love is just a silly game
Then I'm a fool that sang for loving you
Still I feel you don't have nothing to prove
You might also like
Touching you, holding you
Is all I really wanna do
Day and night, I just can't get enough
(I just wanna hold you, yeah)
I want you more, and really need
For you to just believe in me
(You to just believe)
And I'll be giving you all of my love
(All of my love)

Maybe on tomorrow
I can show you years tomorrow
If you let me (If you let me)
Baby, we'll see (Baby, we'll see)
And we can get together
We can try to blend forever holding tightly
Then baby, we can do what we want to

Touching you, holding you
Is all I really wanna do
Day and night, I just can't get enough
(I can't seem to make it without you)
I want you more, and really need (Really need)
For you to just believe in me
(For you to just believe in me, yeah)
And I'll be giving you all of my love
(All of my love, all of my love, yeah)
Touching you, holding you
Is all I really wanna do
(It's all that I really want, baby)
Day and night, I just can't get enough
(Oh, I just wanna hold you)
I want you more, and really need
For you to just believe in me
(I really need you in my life)
