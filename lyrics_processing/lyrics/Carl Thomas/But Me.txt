Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Sometimes, it's the only thing we can do to move on
I know it's hard but you got to do it
The one thing I really deserve to know
Why?

Guess you know
That I came back to tell you
You got to go
And I said I'm tired of these lies
Hit the door
'Cause everything that I been finding has been telling me
That you're not really respecting me, girl

It's hard but this is what I gotta do
(What I gotta do)
I never thought that I would say goodbye to you
(Never thought I)
I took all that I could, but now I'm through
(But now I'm through)
So through with you
(So through with you and all I wanna know, girl, tell me)

Why? Why didn't I know? (Why didn't I know?)
You confused me so (Confused me so)
Maybe there was no one in love but me
How could this be? (How could this be?)
Not what I need
'Cause there was no one else in love but me (Yeah)

It's personal
Girl, the way that you tried me
All I wanna know is:
Did you think I would die
Oh, it hurt me so bad
But I got back up on my two feet
Just to stand my ground
Now it's coming back around

It's hard but this is what I gotta do
(Gotta do)
I never thought that I would say goodbye to you
(Bye-bye, bye-bye, baby)
I took all that I could, but now I'm through
(But now I'm through)
So through with you
(So through with you and all I wanna know, baby)
Why? (Tell me) Why didn't I know? (Why didn't I know?)
You confused me so (You confused me so)
Maybe there was no one in love but me
(Maybe there was no one)
How could this be? (How could this be?)
Not what I need (Not what I need, need)
'Cause there was no one else in love but

All the trust I had (Had)
Can't believe it's gone (Can't believe it's gone)
Packing up your bags (Oh, packing your bags)
Leaving you alone (Leaving you alone)
Gonna find somebody new (Oh, oh)
Who treats me better than you (Better than you)
Appreciates what I do
(Appreciates what I do for you, baby, tell me)

Why? Why didn't I know? (Why?)
You confused me so (You confused me so)
Maybe there was no one in love but me
(There was no one in love but me, yeah)
How could this be? (How could this be?)
Not what I need (You're not what I)
'Cause there was no one else in love but me
Why? (Why? Why?) Why didn't I know?
(Did you leave me brokenhearted?)
You confused me so (Why)
Maybe there was no one in love but me
(Did you confuse me, baby? Oh, tell me why, why)
How could this be? (How could this be?)
Not what I need
'Cause there was no one else in love but
Why? Why didn't I know?
You confused me so
Maybe there was no one in love but me
How could this be?
