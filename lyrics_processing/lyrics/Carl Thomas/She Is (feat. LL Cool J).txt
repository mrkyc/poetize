In the best movie
Like the air that I breathe
That's what she is to me
Like a song I just wrote
Or like coming home
When I've been gone too long
That's what she does to me
Ooohhhh...I wanna always have this feeling
Ooohhhh...Oohh your love is so amazing
Oohh Oohhh...Tell me, tell me, tell me baby
Tell me that you'll never go
She's the light the sun would bring
Everything that means anything to me
That's what she is
And she's so heavenly
She's how the world looks just
Someone who has never seen me
That's what she is
Like a lover's heart
When you first fall in love
Girl it means so much
When you're out of touch
It's like seeing you
For a moment or two
Girl the thought of you
Is what gets me through

That's what she is
And she's so heavenly
She's how the world looks just

What she is to me
I don't think that words can describe
Exactly how you make me feel inside
Never in my life have I been so in love
Oohhhh

Everything that means anything to me
