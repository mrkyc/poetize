Can't wait to have you, dear
'Cause your love is so strong
I need you with me here
Because just a little love grows so long, yeah
It will have you smiling just because
Even when everything is wrong
I got you standing right here and I know it feels good
But don't kiss me
No, no, don't you kiss me
Unless those lips that you kiss me with
Will say I love you, love you for life
And don't touch me
No, no, don't you touch me
Unless you promise that those hands
Will never wave goodbye, can you do that for me baby?
Promise me that tonight , when I hold you in my arms
Lord knows it feels so sincere
And your fragrance turns me on
Can't believe it but I'm gone when you're near
Because just a little love grows so long
It'll have you smiling just because
Even when everything is wrong
Now I got you standing right here, I know it feels good

And don't touch me
No, no, don't you touch me, girl
Unless you promise that those hands
Will never wave goodbye, would you promise me that tonight?
Don't wrap your love deep arms around me
Don't kiss my lips unless you love me, baby
Don't hold my hand unless I'm your man
I wanna hear it baby, can you?
Don't kiss me
No, baby don't you kiss me
Unless those lips of yours, lips of yours
Will say I love you, love you for life
Don't touch me, don't you touch me
Unless you promise those hands
Will never wave goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
