Even though I'm working (A lot)
And sometimes I forget to tell you (Tell you)
Girl, I owe you all that (I've got)
So everything I have is yours

You're my inspiration to my love making
A lover and a friend
The woman that I turn to time and time again
And I just thought you should know

The day just don't start for me
Until you walk through the door
And tell me that you care for me
I just thought you should know
The day just don't start for me
Until you walk through the door
And tell me that you care for me, yeah

Even though we're going on (For years)
Every day's a new day with you (With you)
Even when my mind is (Unclear)
I'll take a look at you and smile
Even without makeup, when I wake up
A beauty to behold
So intelligent and confident, you've got so much soul
And I just thought you should know, oh
You might also like
The day just don't start for me
(My day just don't start)
Until you walk through the door
(Until you walk through that door)
And tell me that you care for me
(And tell me that you care)
I just thought you should know
(You should know)
The day just don't start for me
(The day just don't start)
Until you walk through the door
(Until you...)
And tell me that you care for me
(Tell me that you care for me)
I just thought you should know
(I just thought that you should know, oh oh)
The day just don't start for me
Until you walk through the door
And tell me that you care for me

"Ooh" is what I say when you wear the dress you wear
Heaven is practice on the table
Girl, I am happy 'cause you care
I'll take you anywhere with me
I know they go "ahh" is what they say when you walk into a room
They show respect 'cause I'm with you
They give me a pound, tell me am puttin' it down
With this lady that I've found
(I just thought you should know, I just thought you should know)
The day just don't start for me
Until you walk through the door
(Until you walk through that door)
And tell me that you care for me
(And tell me that you care)
I just thought you should know
(I just thought you should know)
The day just don't start for me
(A rose is still a rose)
Until you walk through the door
(By any other name)
And tell me that you care for me
(Oh, it sounds so sweet)
I just thought you should know
(Oh, so very sweet, my lover)
The day just don't start for me
(Oh-ho, oh-ho)
Until you walk through the door
(Until you walk through that door)
And tell me that you care for me
(And you decide to tell me)
I just thought you should know
(Oh baby, baby)
The day just don't start for me
(That you love me)
Until you walk through the door
(That you can't live without me, baby)
And tell me that you care for me
I'm your everything
I'm your everything, baby, baby, baby
Oh baby, baby, baby, yeah
