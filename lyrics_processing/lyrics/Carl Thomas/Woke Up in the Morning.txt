Woke up in the morning, you were not there
(Where were you, baby?)
All I seen was an imprint of your head
(All I seen, all I seen)
In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
(Why did I treat you?)
I should've known one day that you'd be gone
(I should have known)
You should've known one day that I'd be gone
(You should have known)
You should've known one day that we'd be

Why did you have to end this way?
Baby, all you had to say
Was that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be
But you planned a great escape
Bright and early before I wake
We both knew we had to break
You could've chose a better way

Woke up in the morning, you were not there
(When I woke up this morning)
All I seen was an imprint of your head
(All I seen was an imprint of your)
In my pillow, weeping willow (Willow)
Why'd I treat you so bad (Treat you so bad)
I should've known one day that you'd be gone
(I should have known one day you would be)
You should've known one day that I'd be gone
(You should have known one day I would be)
You should've known one day that we'd be
You might also like
It was cold the way you left
Still the pain is in my chest
Because in my heart I felt you should've came and talked to me
If you put away your pride
And look deep into my eyes
It would've been to your surprise
That I got up to apologize
But you were gone

Woke up in the morning, you were not there
(When I woke up this morning)
All I seen was an imprint of your head
(All I seen was an imprint of your)
In my pillow, weeping willow (Willow)
Why'd I treat you so bad (Treat you so bad)
I should've known one day that you'd be gone
(I should have known one day you would be)
You should've known one day that I'd be gone
(You should have known one day I would be)
You should've known one day that we'd be
Woke up in the morning, you were not there
(When I woke up this morning)
All I seen was an imprint of your head
(All I seen was an imprint of your)
In my pillow, weeping willow (Willow)
Why'd I treat you so bad (Why, why)
I should've known one day that you'd be gone
(Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah)
You should've known one day that I'd be gone
(You should have known one day I would be)
You should've known one day that we'd be
(Gotta leave, gotta leave, gotta go, pack my bag)
Oh, I thought we had forever, now it's gone
(Thought we)
It's time to carry on
(Carry on)
I thought that you made me happy
(Thought that you made me happy)
But it's this thing that's come between us, girl
(Come in between us, girl)
At one time you were my world (Oh)
Now it seems it's gone away, it's gone away

Woke up in the morning, you were not there
(When I woke up this morning)
All I seen was an imprint of your head
(All I seen was an imprint of your)
In my pillow, weeping willow
(Can't you look at me crying?)
Why'd I treat you so bad (So bad)
I should've known one day that you'd be gone
(I should have known, oh)
You should've known one day that I'd be gone
(The way I did you so cold, yeah)
