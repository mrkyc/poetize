I can remember the day I left you
Wasn't that long ago
I said some things I shouldn't have said
And I'm sorry
But you know, ever since that day
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've vowed to myself (Yeah, yeah)
To get you 'round again (Oh)
Just listen

Sitting here wondering what went wrong
Why did you have to leave me?
'Cause I don't really wanna go on
Because I'd rather plead and beg you to stay
'Cause I need you, woman, every single day

It's a cold, cold, cold world
Living here without you in my life
Although I try to get along but I can't
(Try to get along)
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why
(Why oh why)
It's a cold, cold, cold world
Living here without you in my life
(Cold world living without you, baby)
Although I try to get along but I can't
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why
You might also like
Baby love, could you tell me what's on your heart
Because I really wonder, if we can make a brand new start
'Cause I'd rather die than live without your smile
Come on back home, baby
I've been missing you for a while, yeah

It's a cold, cold, cold world
Living here without you in my life
(Living without you, baby)
Although I try to get along but I can't
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why
(Oh, why did you have to leave me, baby?)
It's a cold, cold, cold world
Living here without you in my life
(Oh, living without you)
Although I try to get along but I can't
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why
It's a cold, cold, cold world (Yeah, yeah, baby)
Living here without you in my life (Living, oh)
Although I try to get along but I can't
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why (Why, oh why)
It's a cold, cold, cold world
Living here without you in my life (Living)
Although I try to get along but I can't
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why
Girl, all the wealth I have really doesn't mean a thing
If I can't share it with you, baby
Don't think I'd survive
Well, I've had it all, and lost it all
To have you girl, I'd throw it all away
Oh, baby, I need you, hey hey hey, yeah

It's a cold, cold, cold world
Living here without you in my life
Although I try to get along but I can't
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why
(I'm trying to get along, yeah, oh oh oh)
It's a cold, cold, cold world
(But it's a cold, cold world)
Living here without you in my life
(Living without you)
Although I try to get along but I can't
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why
(I need you, baby)
It's a cold, cold, cold world
Living here without you in my life
(Nobody else is gonna do)
Although I try to get along but I can't
'Cause I need you to be here, why oh why
(Nobody else can keep me warm)
It's a cold, cold, cold world
Living here without you in my life
(And I really mean it, oh oh)
Although I try to get along but I can't
(Try to get along)
