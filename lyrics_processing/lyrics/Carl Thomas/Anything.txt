Ayo, Carl, talk to 'em

This is oh so crazy
'Cause I love my baby
And I'd do anything that she wants to make her happy
It's the way she holds me
And the way she hugs me
Got me rushing home
Can't hardly wait to have her near me

(And I can't seem to get her off of my mind)
Just like a diamond or some kind of precious treasure
And it's never too much, 'cause I love her so much
'Cause you know that I'm the only one
Who's gonna treat you like a jewel

(What you want, what you need, tell me, girl)
Tell me, girl (It's guaranteed)
Know that it's guaranteed
(I'll give you anything)
I'll give you (What you like) what you like
(Me to do) Me to do
(Got to be) Got to be (there for you)
There for you, baby girl, yeah

Anyone you know I can
Make you do the things you do
Girl, I give my love to you

(And I just can't seem to walk away, no)
But just like a fortune or something no one can measure
And it's never too much
'Cause I love her so much
'Cause you know that I'm the only one
Who's gonna love you like a jewel
