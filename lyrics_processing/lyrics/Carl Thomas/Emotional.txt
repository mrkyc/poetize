I knew you when
I had a friend
Very deeply
Love lived within
But somehow we got loose
From what was oh so tight
Somewhere we went wrong
When we were oh so right

What's a man to do when he just can't take no more?
Oh, what's a man to do?
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?
Now I've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends?

I'm emotional, and I can't let go (Woah, and I can't let go, let go)
I am trying to hold on to you (I'm trying to hold on to you)
Though it hurts me so (Hurts me so), gotta let you know (Gotta let you know)
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you
You might also like
You seem to hurt
Me purposely
I didn't understand it
Oh girl, why me?
I had no choice
What was best for us
Was to terminate our love and be free

What's a man to do when he just can't take no more?
Oh, what's a man to do? Yeah
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?
Now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends?

I'm emotional, and I can't let go (And I can't let you go)
I am trying to hold on to you (I'm trying to hold on you)
Though it hurts me so (Oh), gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you
I'm emotional, and I can't let go (Sayin' goodbye to you, woah, woah, yeah)
I am trying to hold on to you (I'm trying to hold on)
Though it hurts me so (Though it hurts me so), gotta let you know (Gotta let you know)
That the love we once shared now is through (Love we once shared)
Say goodbye to you
What's a man to do when he just can't take no more?
Oh, what's a man to do? Yeah
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?
Oh, now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends?

I'm emotional, and I can't let go (And I can't let you go)
I am trying to hold on to you (I'm trying, I'm trying, yeah)
Though it hurts me so, gotta let you know (I got to let you go)
That the love we once shared now is through (Can I let you know the once that we once shared was through)
Say goodbye to you
I'm emotional (I'm emotional), and I can't let go (Look at me, I can't stop crying)
I am trying to hold on to you (Inside my heart it's slowly dying)
Though it hurts me so (Oh-ho), gotta let you know (Gotta, gotta let you know)
