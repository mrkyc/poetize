There are certain
Feelings that I have for you
They've been bubbling
Since the day that we were introduced

I don't know (Don't know) what to do
'Cause I'm so gone (I'm so gone) over you (Hey)
And I (I) don't know why
(I feel this way, yeah)

Don't quite know (Don't quite know) what it is
Something 'bout you, baby
Something 'bout you, baby
Not for sure what it is (What it is, what it is)
Something 'bout you, baby
Something 'bout you, baby

It's the little, mmm
Things you do that turn me on
Like a pillow
You're so soft, baby, we belong together
