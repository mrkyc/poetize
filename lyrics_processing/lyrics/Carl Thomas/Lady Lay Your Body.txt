Oh, oh, lady, would you lay
Lady, would you lay
I'll rub them all away

Lady, lay your body (Hey, hey)
Let me rub the lonely
Places all away (Rub them all away)
Lady, lay your body (Hey, hey, hey)
Let me rub the lonely (Hey, hey)
I wanna rub your loneliness away

Last night I think I fell in love with you
It was from a window watching you around my way
(Around my way)
I was too shy to even call to you
So I wrote some words that made it easier to say
Lady, would you lay

Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
(I wanna rub them all away)
Places all away (Hey, all away)
Lady, lay your body (Your body)
Let me rub the lonely
I wanna rub your loneliness away
You might also like
Visions of you around my bed
Nothing but roses when you rest your lovely head
And I'll put my everything in you, you
You know I'm the only one who knows just what to do
Lady, would you lay

Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
(I wanna rub your body)
Places all away (Oh, all away)
Lady, lay your body
(Lady, would you lay your body for me)
Let me rub the lonely
('Cause I know you're lonely)
I wanna rub your loneliness away
(Lonely, lonely)

You've waited oh so long for me to come your way
(But now I'm here and sadness is gone away, lay lady lay)
Lady, lady, lady, won't you lay with me, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh, lady, would you lay

Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
(I wanna rub your body)
Places all away (All away, baby)
Lady, lay your body
Let me rub the lonely
(You will know exactly what to do when I know)
I wanna rub your loneliness away
(I wanna rub it all away, yeah yeah yeah)
Lady, lay your body (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Let me rub the lonely
(Oh, let me rub away)
Places all away
(The loneliness all away)
Lady, lay your body
(Lady, lay your body)
Let me rub the lonely
(I wanna rub them all away)
I wanna rub your loneliness away
All away
Hey hey, I wanna rub them all away
