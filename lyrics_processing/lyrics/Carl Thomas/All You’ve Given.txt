Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh yeah yeah
Baby
Oh ho ho ho ho
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Ooh girl, I love you, I love you
Place no one above you
Can't you see that you're the one for me? (Yeah)
And I, don't think that I want to
Fill this life without you
You're the best love I've ever known
And it's all my own

She gives me love
Like the warm sunshine hanging over my shoulder
And she makes me smile
Every time I'm looking in her face
(Baby, I look into your face)
And every time she leaves my world's just a little bit colder
(My world, my world, my world)
So baby, with all that you've given to me
I'm making sure you're happy
You might also like
Ooh girl, can't wait until tonight
'Cause pleasure is delight
With your warm body by the fireplace
Oh girl, want you to depend on
My love and my strong arms
'Cause you know they feel so good and natural
She gives me love

She gives me love
Like the warm sunshine hanging over my shoulder (Love)
And she makes me smile
Every time I'm looking in her face
(Every time I'm looking into her face)
And every time she leaves my world's just a little bit colder
(My world, my world, my world)
So baby, with all that you've given to me
I'm making sure you're happy, oh

On (On) you (You) I (I) can (Can) depend (Depend)
