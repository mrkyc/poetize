What's the matter, girl?
You're not speaking to me
And I don't know why
What I do this time?
Baby, I don't have a clue
As to what is eating you

Girl, I'm just trying to love you better
(Girl, I'm just trying to love you better)
Do whatever it takes to stay together
(Do anything, oh)
Don't give a damn what people say
(Don't give a damn what people say)
'Cause at the end of the day
(It's all about you and me, yeah)

How can we (How)
Get it right (Get it right)
I don't wanna spend another sleepless night
(Baby, you tell me)
And how do we (How do we)
Get it back (Yeah, yeah)
To where we were at before the drama started

And go somewhere (Go somewhere)
And leave us the hell alone

To where we were at before the drama started

How can we (Oh baby)
Get it right

I don't wanna spend another sleepless night
('Cause I can't sleep at night, no)
And how do we get it back
('Cause I miss your leg around me)
To where we were at
(When we laid together)
Before the drama started
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, I really miss you
Do anything for you, oh
