See, there are just a few things that I'd like to explain to you
It's a new day, and you're a liberated woman
And you can tell me exactly what you want from me
You can tell me all of the erotic desires that you can ponder
You can tell me everything that your man won't dare

Ooh, baby, there is so much work we got to do, oh
Ooh, ooh baby, and you know exactly what to do, oh oh
Ooh, ooh baby, you know exactly how I feel, oh
Ooh, ooh baby, everything you do is oh so real (So real, oh, oh yeah)
Just a sample of what it is, and what it means to love a man like me
But see, you just can't come with an average love

Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
There's room to conversate
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
'Cause you know you can
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Ooh, let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I wanna talk about it (Talk about it)
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Be-doo-ba-ba-ba-ba (Be-doo-ba-ba-ba-ba)
These are the things that are required

I want Dolce & Gabbana, a girl named Tawana
And a Rolex for my wrist
I want a day with Janet on another planet
And it ends up with a kiss
I wanna make six figures, hang out with my niggas
And I wake when I want
I want all the little things that fame and money brings
And I never have to front

Let's talk about it
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)

And you know that it's not a contradiction of my masculinity
(And you know this)
'Cause I'll beat a buster down (And you know this)
Tryna run up and clown
In this game that I have, to hold only for you
(Only for you, ooh baby, only for you, only for you)
You're my one and only
(Only for you, only for you)
You're my one and only
(Ooh baby, ooh baby)
One and only
(One and only, one and only, ooh baby, one and only)
