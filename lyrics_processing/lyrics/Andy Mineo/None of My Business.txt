Yeah, if you don't like me, that's your problem
When I let it bother me, that's my problem
And I've got enough problems, I got enough
I got the sauce, you got the salt
What I care what you think about me
'Cause I don't think about you at all
Real ones, they don't talk about you they talk to you
When they can't miss, yeah that's when they take a shot for you
When they throw stones then you know they don't rock with you
Don't you ever let 'em know that the talk got to you
I'm 'bout my business (My)
Father, my family, my hitters (You)
Never paid my bills, so
Why pay attention?

That's none of my business (What they think 'bout me)
That's none of my business (What they sayin' 'bout me)
That's none of my (That's none of my business)
That's none of my (That's none of my business)
That's none of my
We don't really care what you talkin' 'bout
That's none of my business (What they sayin' 'bout me, yeah)
That's none of my business (What they think 'bout me, yeah)
That's none of my (That's none of my business)
That's none of my (That's none of my business)
That's none of my
We don't really care what you talkin' 'bout
That's none of my business

Yeah, if you don't like me, that's your problem (Hey)
When I let it bother me, that's my problem (Aye)
And I've got enough problems, look, I got enough
Why everybody wanna take one up?
You ain't prayed for me, you ain't take one up
When they don't know the story they just make one up, aye
Gossip, stop it, why you want to talk to me about it?
Go tell he or she about it, that's none of my business, leave me out it
'stead of subtweetin' about it, don't FB just be about it
You acting like a F Boyardee, if it weren't for God, I'd destroy your teeth
I got anger issues
Watch for the people that's hanging with you
Bad company be corrupting the good character
You supposed to own a company
Instead you just sitting on your derriere in a pair of your boxers playing Warfare on your Xbox
You work at a pet shop, still couldn't feed your terrier
And on top, what's scarier is how you've been engaged for ten years and still haven't married her (Err)
My bad, I got sidetracked, look at me getting hypocrite, huh
How I criticize them when I got my own thing to be fixing?
Listen
That's none of my business (What they think 'bout me)
That's none of my business (What they sayin' 'bout me)
That's none of my (That's none of my business)
That's none of my (That's none of my business)
That's none of my
We don't really care what you talkin' 'bout
That's none of my business (What they sayin' 'bout me, yeah)
That's none of my business (What they think 'bout me, yeah)
That's none of my (That's none of my business)
That's none of my (That's none of my business)
That's none of my
We don't really care what you talkin' 'bout

That's none of my
That's none of my
That's none of my
That's none of my
That's none of my
