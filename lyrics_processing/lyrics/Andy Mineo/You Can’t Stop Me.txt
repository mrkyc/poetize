You can't stop me!

Huh, can't stop, won't stop
Where the brakes at?
I give 'em that Diddy Bop
Like take that, take that, take that, take that
I'mma put in work, I'mma do that ASAP
Throw my faith in rap
But they say don't say that, huh?
What I'ma turn down for?
I feel like Shaq in '94
Breaking glass in that backboard
Or like Kobe in Toronto, huh
Droppin' 81, yo, I drop the 88
Ricky Bobby, shake and bake
Sleepin' on us shoulda stayed awake
Everybody make mistakes like VJs tryna say my name
It's Mineo, say it with me, Mineo
Okay, great
Two forks high, raise the stakes
Risk it all, I take the hate
It's the winning team, get the Gatorade
My God good, but he's not safe, nah
You might also like
They try to shut us down, and it ain't gon' slide
Only thing I fear is God and He on my side
That's the confidence of God, cause He got me
That's why I really feel like
You can't stop me!
That's all you got?
Come on with it
That's all you got?
You can't stop me!
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option, (me) I'm my biggest problem
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option (me)
You can't stop me!

You're my biggest opponent
You know me, I know you, we know it
Whenever I fail you've always been there to simply remind me I've blown it
You don't see when I'm growin'
You don't see where I'm goin'
You only see in the moment
You know my mistakes, you never let go it
Huh, don't cease to amaze me and it drives me crazy, huh
That you catch every detail that I miss in the songs I'm makin', sayin'
You will never write a verse like Kendrick
Never be to rap what rock got from Hendrix
Top 10 alive you will never be mentioned
Why aim so high, won't survive the trenches
Plus, you a Christian Andy, they will never listen Andy
Plus, where your pigment Andy?
You don't got skill, you a gimmick Andy
Well, if I listen to you and everything you put in my ear
I'll be livin' like woulda, shoulda, coulda
I'll be paralyzed by fear
Huh, ain't that the truth, if I quit the only way I lose
I got two choices when I do this, make moves or make excuses
Huh, if you know who I'm talkin' about, then you got me
My biggest enemy is me, and even I can't stop me
They try to shut us down, and it ain't gon' slide
Only thing I fear is God and He on my side
That's the confidence of God, cause He got me
That's why I really feel like
You can't stop me!
That's all you got?
Come on with it
That's all you got?
You can't stop me!
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option, (me) I'm my biggest problem
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option (me)
You can't stop me!

I said if I cannot stop me then you'll never stop me
Oh, no (can't stop)
Oh, no (won't stop)
I said if I cannot stop me then you'll never stop me
Oh, no (can't stop)
Oh, no (won't stop)
I said if I cannot stop me then you'll never stop me
Oh, no (can't stop)
Oh, no (won't stop)
I said if I cannot stop me then you'll never stop me
Oh, no
You can't stop me!
That's all you got?
Come on with it
That's all you got?
You can't stop me!
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option, (me) I'm my biggest problem
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option (me)
