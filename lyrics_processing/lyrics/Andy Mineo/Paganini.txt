Uh, huh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

What you wanna do, act loco?
Hit 'em with the old to the flow that I grew up on, then I grew up on 'em
And funny now how I flow for Hova, heh
Words twisted, but yo, I'm sober, uh
Never really been the type to pour up
When I get this thing goin' I don't like to slow up
Mouth movin' like a motor when I bite the flow up
But I bet they won't stop, let me go, let me go, woo
I'ma show off every ability God's given me to go off in
Nobody mad about the beauty of the Vatican and the tabernacle
So when I'm rappin' you can add it in
Breakin' 'em with the shatter
They're gonna wanna put me in a place with paddin', and I'ma damage 'em every time like a player that's on the cover of Madden
God, the original
We bright, look out!

I feel like I'm Paganini
Huh, who?
Paganini
Huh, eh
I feel like I'm Paganini
Who? (Freestylin')
Paganini

Let me do it
K to the second letter, finna get it poppin'
Comin' out the pocket like, everybody get to rockin' doin' the Paganini
Killin' the beat, my tongue is like a violin
Give it to 'em like I'm not a human
When I'm doing what I'm doing
Keepin' it comin' like an automatic shooter
When we get to rippin' it ridiculous
And everybody gets to speakin' about these riveting brothers that's goin' in again
But they don't know even when they got that flow (Got that flow)
I don't know why they boast, everybody's gifts borrowed (look)
Producers, directors, skilled architectures
Do what they do to whom they're connected
True was the God that chooses to bless them
Who is the one you think they reflectin'?

I feel
Uh-huh, yeah (God given) like I'm Paganini
Huh, who?

Huh, eh
I feel like I'm Paganini

Canon
Yeah, woo
Hey Andy, ok, ok
So down for my clique, shut up (y'all corny)
Oh shoot, shut up
I've been itchin' to stick 'em up with this killer Canon
Comin' to cut 'em and hit 'em harder, ooh, kill 'em!
Hold up, I've been hittin' everything up in me like I'm Paganini
Hittin' every rhythm like a milli chopped ya
I know you heard Twista, and Tech-a-Nina hittin' ya
But Canon's original, I'm a Midwest monster, kill 'em!
Blat! Blat!
Mineo and Kevin got adrenaline
Comin' to drill 'em with the real gospel
Comin' up to the game
Still the same, bigger the name, bigger the fame
To the glory they follow Him and the Father
While I'm comin' and killin' the game
I'm breakin' 'em off and we know
They steady tryna imitate the steelo
I'm hittin' with the fire, spittin' super wild
Runnin' with the young and unashamed
I'm Paganini on a kilo, amigo

Uh-huh, yeah (God given)
I feel like I'm Paganini
Huh, who?
Paganini
Huh, eh
I feel like I'm Paganini
Who? (Freestylin')
Paganini
