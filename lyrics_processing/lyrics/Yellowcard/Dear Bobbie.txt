Dear Bobbie
Do you remember when you were young and very pretty? I do
I remember pleated skirts, black and white saddle shoes
Do you remember dancing half the night?
I do, I still think of you when we dance
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then

Do you remember when
How long has it been?
1945, you opened my blue eyes
To see a whole new life
Do you remember when
I told you this that night?
That if you're by my side
When every day begins
I'll fall for you again
I made a promise when
I told you this that night

I'll be fine
Cause when i die, then i die loving you
It's alright, i'll be fine
When i die then i die loving you
Loving you, loving you

Do you remember the times we would give up on each other then get back together
Then we finally was married in 1949
We drove the yellow convertible on our honeymoon
Do you remember? I do

Life has led us here
Together all these years
This house that we have made
Holds 20,000 days
The memories we've saved
Since life has led us here


I'm coming home to you
Slipping off my shoes
Resting in my chair
I see you standing there
The silver in your hair
I'm coming home to you
When i lay tonight
When i close my eyes
I know the sun will rise
Here or the next life
As long as you're still mine, then it's alright

You have grey hair now
But you are a beautiful woman
And the years have been good to both of us
We walk slow now, but we still have each other
The glue of love is still bonding us together
