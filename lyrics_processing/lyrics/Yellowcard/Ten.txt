Hmmmm...
I found out in the fall, I've been gone
On the road for a year
She said, "Honey, I've got real bad news"
And then there were just tears
And we would never be the same again
Since then I've often wondered
What you might have been like
How it would have felt to hold you
Would you have had my eyes?
Don't you think we would've been best friends?

You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
And you would have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart

We were twenty-two years young then
Breaking rules all around
We were moving in that first apartment
It felt like it was never gonna end
Both so lost and crazy
We were young so we ran
Now I live in a dream where I am
Holding your little hands
I never got to meet you, my best friend

You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
You would be out in the sun
Until it was gone
You would be watching Star Wars
With your PJs on
And you would have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart

Don't you think we would have been best friends?

You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
You would be out in the sun
Until it was gone
You would be watching Star Wars
With your PJs on
You would be playing tunes on
On your first guitar
You would be harmony to
Every single part of me
And you have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart
