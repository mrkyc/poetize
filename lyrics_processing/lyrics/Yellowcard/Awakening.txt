Bottoms up tonight
I drink to you and I
'Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life
And with this empty glass
I will break the past
'Cause with the morning I can open my eyes
I want this to be my awakening

I give this one to you
An anthem full of truth
I tell you now an epic tale of what you put me through
And even though you don't
Deserve one of your own
A melody, a song about the life that you let go
I can't believe that I still care enough to write

Bottoms up tonight
I drink to you and I
'Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life
And with this empty glass
I will break the past
'Cause with the morning I can open my eyes
I want this to be my awakening

Yes, I miss you still
And probably always will
I'm living with a busted heart that I will have until
I find the strength I know
Is somewhere in my bones
So pull the curtain up again and get on with this show
At least you know that I still care enough to write

Bottoms up tonight
I drink to you and I
'Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life
And with this empty glass
I will break the past
'Cause with the morning I can open my eyes
And maybe I will see
A different destiny
Like knowing you at all
Was only a bad dream
I want this to be my awakening
 - x2
No rest for the wicked they say
Forgive me if I try to change
Bottoms up tonight
I drink to you and I
'Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life
And with this empty glass
I will break the past
'Cause with the morning I can open my eyes
And maybe I will see
A different destiny
Like knowing you at all
Was only a bad dream
