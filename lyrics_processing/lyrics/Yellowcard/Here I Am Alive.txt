If I could write to the kid I was before
I'd tell him you'll get everything you ever wanted
But you will still want more

Someone's going to tell you
Who you should want to be
So you'll forget the vision that they didn't want to see
And when they give up, 'cause they will give up
Say, here I am alive

They say you don't grow up
You just grow old
It's safe to say I haven't done both
I made mistakes, I know, I know
But here I am alive
So many people close to me cut me down
This is supposed to be a bad luck town
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground
But here I am alive

If I could write to myself
When I was on top of it all
I'd say you're going overboard
And when you're falling
You're gonna feel so small

Someone's gonna tell you that you deserve the worst
They'll say you're never coming back
And tell you that you're cursed
And when they give up, cause they always give up
Say, here I am alive

They say you don't grow up
You just grow old
It's safe to say I haven't done both
I made mistakes, I know, I know
But here I am alive
So many people close to me cut me down
This is supposed to be a bad luck town
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground
But here I am alive

And when they give up, cause they will give up
Say, here I am alive
When they give up, cause they always give up
Say, here I am alive

They say you don't grow up
You just grow old
It's safe to say I haven't done both
I made mistakes, I know, I know
But here I am alive
So many people close to me cut me down
This is supposed to be a bad luck town
I jumped, I fell, I hit the ground
But here I am alive
Here I am alive!
Here I am alive!
Here I am alive!
Here I am alive!
