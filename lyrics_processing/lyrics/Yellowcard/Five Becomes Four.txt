Needed some time
So I could find
A little strength to redefine
What I've become
What I have done
I never asked to be the one

I'm riding it out
This storm that you brought in
Bringing it down on me
Around for you, I go again
It's got to be easy to see
What everyone takes out of me
Knocking me down
Dragging me out
How did you end up in that crowd?

Did you run away?
Did you fall apart?
Did you see yourself
For what you are?
Will you be looking for it anymore
When five becomes four?
When you're all alone with no melody
Do you close your eyes
And think of me?
Will you still hear me singing anymore
When five becomes four?

Try and put aside your history and pride
Maybe for one moment in time
We'll all be on your side
The story goes
Nobody knows
What it was like when you would throw
Someone who cared out in the air
Then let them crash down anywhere

Did you run away?
Did you fall apart?
Did you see yourself
For what you are?
Will you be looking for it anymore
When five becomes four?
When you're all alone with no melody
Do you close your eyes
And think of me?
Will you still hear me singing anymore
When five becomes four?

Remember the line "never say die"
You were the reason I survived
Where did you go?
I need to know
I waited here, you never showed
It's gonna be harder for me
I can't forgive so many things
When you were down, I was around
Why would you try and hurt me now?
Just tell me why?
Just tell me why?
Did you run away?
Did you run away?
Did you run away?

Did you run away?
Did you fall apart?
Did you see yourself
For what you are?
Will you be looking for it anymore
When five becomes four?
When you're all alone with no melody
Do you close your eyes
And think of me?
Will you still hear me singing anymore
