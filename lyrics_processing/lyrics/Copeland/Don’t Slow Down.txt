You could fall so quickly
But don't you dare slow down for me
Were it not for hearts like mine
Calloused thickly
You could fall so easily
(Don't you dare slow down for me)
You can take everything I have
Just don't leave my side
No, don't leave my side
You can take everything I have
Just don't leave my side
No, don't leave my side
'Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it
This moment could be our last
You fall in love and I'm running after
You move way too fast
But don't slow down
And don't let go
Hold me close now, lest I fall
They say I don't know how to love the right way
But you make me feel
You make me feel like I do
You might also likeYou can take everything I have
Just don't leave my side
No, don't leave my side
You can take everything I have
Just don't leave my side
No, don't leave my side
'Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it
This moment could be our last
You fall in love and I'm running after
You move way too fast
'Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it
(Don't slow down)
This moment could be our last
(Don't slow down)
You fall in love and I'm running after
(Don't slow down)
You move way too fast
Don't slow down
Don't slow down
'Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it
This moment could be our last
You fall in love and I'm running after
You move way too fast
'Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it
(Don't slow down)
This moment could be our last
(Don't slow down)
You fall in love and I'm running after
(Don't slow down)
You move way too fast
Don't slow down
