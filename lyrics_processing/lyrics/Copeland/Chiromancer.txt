Forever yours
And I can feel you in the morning sun
You warm me like no other one
Forever yours
And I can feel you in the morning sun
You warm me like no other one
Forever yours
Your voice is fading, I call your name
Cause I'm still here and the only thing that's left for me is listening
Its the only way I make it through the night
Are we just fooling ourselves, living in the moment?
Am I just dying inside living all alone here?
In a storm of quiet voices you're the only one that I can ever find
Just say you're mine and the fog would lift cause the only thing that's missing now is everything
It's the only way I make it through the night
Are we just fooling ourselves, living in the moment?
Am I just dying inside living all alone here?
In a storm of quiet voices you're the only one that I can ever find
You might also like
In morning light, in the darkest night and in-between I'm forever yours
I hear you call my name and every sound's the same, I hear you call my name
If only I could call up through the void to reach you
If only I could stretch across the depths to hold you
If only for a moment I can make two parts a whole, if only for a moment I could rest beside your soul, I could rest beside your soul
And I can feel you in the morning sun
You warm me like no other one
Forever yours
Your voice is fading, I call your name
Cause I'm still here and the only thing that's left for me is listening
It's the only way I make it through the night
Are we just fooling ourselves, living in the moment?
Am I just dying inside living all alone here?
In a storm of quiet voices you're the only one that I can never find
Just say you're mine and the fog would lift cause the only thing that's missing now is everything
You're the only way I make it through the night
Are we just fooling ourselves, living in the moment (I'm dying)
Am I just dying inside living all alone here (I'm dying)
