Mmm, you're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day
You're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day
You're gonna want me back in your arms

You're gonna wake up when time has taken your throne
You'll taste the bitterness (Yes you will, boy)
Of being alone (Boy, yes you will)
There's no splendor in the darkness of night
When there's no loving arms to hold you tight

You better stop and think about what you're doing
You better stop and think about what you're doing
Mmm, give a little back of what you've been taking (Ooh)
Better start being for real and stop your faking
You better prepare yourself for that rainy day (Ooh)
You better throw a little tenderness and affection my way

Oh, ooh
You're gonna need me, need me one day
You're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day
You're gonna want me back in your arms

Tell me who's gonna take the heartbreak I took
And still be there at the close of the book? (You worry 'bout me)
When you've grown older and lost your way
And all your rainbows have turned to gray

You better stop and think about what you're doing
You better stop and think about what you're doing
Well, give a little back of what you've been taking (Ooh)
Better start being for real and stop your faking
You better prepare yourself, ooh, for that rainy day (Ooh)
You better throw a little tenderness and affection my way

Oh, ooh
You're gonna need me, one day
You're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day (One day)
You're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day (Ooh, well, yeah)
You're gonna want me back in your arms (Ooh)
You're gonna need me, one day (You're gonna need me and)
