Come closer now
So I can see you in the dark
I wanna hold your body next to mine
I wanna hurry, love, and take my time, mhm
Hold onto me
And let me feel you in my arms
Touch me and slowly steal my breath away
Then tell me things that no one else would say

And I wanna feel your heart here every night
And I long to hear your voice saying, "It's alright"
To know you, so you

Whisper in the dark, oh, oh
Stuck there in the night, I know, oh
Touch me with a spark, oh, oh
And as we join together, love, I'll never let you go, oh no

Where we are
Is where I always want to stay
I love to kiss you as we break apart
And share the secrets deep inside my heart
You might also like
And I want to feel you right here every night
I long to hear your voice saying, "It's alright"
To know you, so you

Whisper in the dark, oh, oh
Stuck there in the night, I know, I know
Touch me with a spark, oh, oh
And as we join together, love, I'll never let you go
Never let you go

Travel with me through time and space
Each night is all we need
Our love will be a private place
To come to, so you

Whisper in the dark, in the dark
Stuck there in the night, I know, oh
Touch me with a spark, oh, oh
And as we join together, love
We will whisper in the dark, oh, oh
Stuck there in the night, I know, oh
Touch me with a spark, oh, oh
Stuck there in the night, I know, oh
Whisper in the dark, oh, oh
Stuck there in the night, I know, oh
Touch me with a spark, oh, oh
