What (woo ooh ooh ooh oo)
Where (woo ooh ooh ooh oo)
Why (tell me why, tell me why, tell me why)
I don't understand
Let's sit down and talk
One minute you love me and then you walk
There's more going on
Than you will admit
'cause just as we got it to work you quit
I'm caught in a fog
And you make it clear
The truth won't be worse than the things I fear
It's a mystery to me
I haven't a clue
If somebody else has a part of you
Tell me
Who (who)
What when where why (why)
Who is the guy
What made you need someone new
Tell me
Who what when where why
When did it die
When'd we go wrong
Don't you lie, tell me why
You might also likeYou won't be my love
You won't be my friend
But won't you at least help me comprehend
What's happening to me
'cause after you go
My one consolation will be to know
The places and names, the reason and rhymes
The facts of the matter and points in time
I tried for your love
But you won't allow
This guy to do nothin' but ask you how
And - who (who)
What when where why (why)
Who is the guy
What made you need someone new
Tell me
Who what when where why
When did it die
When'd we go wrong
Don't you lie, tell me why
I want you to say
What's inside your head
Confession is good for the soul it's said
So start at the top and take it real slow
If you want out, then I have to know
Just - who (who)
What when where why (why)
Who is the guy
What made you need someone new
Tell me
Who what when where why
When did it die
When'd we go wrong
