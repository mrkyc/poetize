Saw a young gunslinger with something to prove
And I came looking, like anybody else
Came searching, like anybody else
Looking for that golden calf
I came shooting for the stars, like any youngblood
Found a fat-cat city and a crooked judge
And I killed anything standing in my path
Killed anything till I layed my hands
Layed them on that golden calf
Now it's my last stand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance, oh, for this kind of man
And I'm still looking for something to prove
I come around full circle, aged like an old dog
Looking at them young bucks, green as frogs
I ain't layin' back, no time to laugh
I ain't layin' back, there's a new kid coming
Gunning for that golden calf
I was looking for America in a western movie
Saw a young gunslinger with something to prove
He was headed down that dusty path
He was headed down to that bloodbath
Chasing down that golden calf

This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance, oh, for this kind of man
And I'm still looking for something to prove
But there's always someone faster
Someone quicker on the draw
Someone with a hunger closing in
Someone younger stepping up to be the best outlaw
This my last stand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance, oh, for this kind of man
And I'm still looking for something to prove
Yeah I'm still looking for something to prove
This my last stand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is my last stand
Yeah this is my last stand
