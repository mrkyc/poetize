Waitin' at a stoplight yesterday
As a funeral precession made its way through the gates
I watched it roll up a windin' road
Through a field of green with white headstones all in a row
And it made me think about where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
On the generous and mostly undeserved blessings that I've had

Had an all American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life is mine
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go

I've said a prayer for the dearly departed
And the loved ones left broken hearted, then traffic started
And I drove away a little more able
To see the good things on my table
For that, I'm grateful
'Cause I've had my troubles, I've had my trials
I've hit the mark and I've missed by miles
Had days when I've been fightin' mad
But the good times have more than outweighed the bad
You might also like
Got to hold my newborn baby girl
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
I've laughed so hard I couldn't stop
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
(Good to go, yeah)

I've been thinkin' 'bout where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
And I wouldn't wanna change nothin' about this
Roll-with-the-punches life I've had

Had an all American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends that you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life is mind
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
(I'm good to go)
I'm good to go
(Good to go)
I'm good to go (I'm good to go)
(Good to go)
