When the little guns come
And they wanna bust guns
And they run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son
When the little guns come
And they wanna bust guns
And they run when I come with that warrior song
Got my back to the sun, when I rise
I'm the one, chosen for the day proud
I'm the warrior's son
We about to go...
We about to go up
We about to go...
We about to go up
Like up, like up, like up, like up-up-up-up-up-up...
Like woo!

Yeah we got it going up like that
Mama said if they acting tough, fight back
Yeah I had to rough 'em up like that
Beat 'em 'till I see 'em, holdin' up white flag
I be whipping ass, take 'em to class, who wanna go?
I just hit the gas, I was too fast , ain't even know
I was throwing jabs, you get a blow, you get a blow
Knew they wouldn't last, leaving your ass right on the floor
Just imagine killers in action, you rachet
All that smack shit, give them an accent, who asked that?
See they reaction, slaying dragons, what happened?
I'm breaking fragments, they doing backflips, get backwards
Bam

I't about to go up, break 'em like internet
Groupies wanna run up, we leave in the dead
You know how it go down, you know we into that
Trust no one, guilty 'till proven innocent
You just made me mad, I'm finna start spazzin'
Okay, true that, I feel that heat rising
Throw your ass in the trash, I hate to be trifling
But keep on playing these games you might just be lifeless
Can't stop me, beast mode, I'm too cocky
Leave 'em scared I bet he scared, he too happy
Leave 'em dead right where he stand, do you copy?
You understand you get these hands if you try me
