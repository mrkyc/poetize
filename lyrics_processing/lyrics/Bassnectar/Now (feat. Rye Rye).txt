Everybody get foolish
Put your hands in the air, let's do this
All around the globe goin' stupid
Pay someone or you're goin' to get muted
I - yeah I know it's the coolest
All around town we down with the rudest
Yeah I know how we do this
When you rock with the beat then you know I got to lose it
Ain't even trying to hear this shit
Mind go and spins like a disco glisten
Shots this way now one never miss 'em
Send 'em right back now huh back the mix
Simple now don't go down
Win the dance floor like you can now
Never sick because I got my rounds
Hold it down like this up now

I got a lot a bounce
So much heavy that I shake the house
Movin it in and out
Hold it down like this up now
Eh, uh, this up now
Gotta all act like this up now
Put it to your head like this up now
Hold it down like this up now
I got a lot a bounce
So much heavy that I shake the house
Movin it in and out
Hold it down like this up now
Eh, uh, this up now
Gotta all act like this up now
Put it to your head like this up now
Hold it down like this up now

Gotta hold us down
Cause' we all hate livin' though we be one of them
All hate livin' though we be one of them
All hate livin' though we be one of them

What's up now
Gotta hold us down
Cause' we all hate livin' though we be one of them
All hate livin' though we be one of them

I'm- I'm drenched and I'm drippin' with sweat
Turning it up to the max
Who's 'onna be ownin' up for a dance
I just wanna party with friends
'Cause I hate goin' on in the club
Everybody lookin' at me like "pop-pop baby"
Yeah I do get grunt in a place
When everybody be chillin' when I'm goin' crazy
Rock it don't stop it
To the floor we guh' drop it
Now overroll, we just livin'
Baby drinkin' and spillin'
But I got this amazing feelin'
But I catch these clubs that I dealin'
I'm like "that's what we came for, take it to the main floor!"

I got a lot a bounce
So much heavy that I shake the house
Movin it in and out
Hold it down like this up now
Eh, uh, this up now
Gotta all act like this up now
Put it to your head like this up now
Hold it down like this up now
