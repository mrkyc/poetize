The beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic
I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic
The joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic
I don't want to die
Last in the age of innocence
Trapped in a traffic accident
Got to escape the hospital
Intensive care
Don't try to fool yourself
You bag of skin and blood
One day I break your heart
And bury you in mud
Don't be an egotist
The doctor wants your room
You had your go at life
The time is up you're doomed
Death is too drastic
I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic
The joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic
I don't want to die
You might also likeI have to boost my confidence
Build me a strong immune defense
Take on the virus drilling
In my chilling spine
Look st your body
How the pieces fall apart
There ain't no brainwave
Ain't no pumpin' from the heart
That was your life my dear
I'm bored with your account
Before your body blow
Pay back my full amount
Life is fantastic
The beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic
I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic
The joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic
I don't want to die
You think you're so unique
You think you have it all
Deep down inside you're weak
I shake and make you fall
Don't be an egotist
The doctor wants your room
You had your go at life
The time is up you're doomed
Life is fantastic
The beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic
I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic
The joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic
I don't want to die
Life is fantastic
The beauty and sorrow
Death is too drastic
I can't say goodbye
Golden or plastic
The joys of tomorrow
Life is fantastic
