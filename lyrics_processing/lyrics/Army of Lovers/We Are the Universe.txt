There is protein everywhere
Life begins when stars collide
And my womb is open wide
Where the rockets fear to slide
I'm the peacock valentino
Planets live in coalition
White and slimey I'm bambino
Ready in attack position
There's a rocket in my pocket
Here's the plug now where's the socket
Supersonic electronic
Check the splashing when I crash
Dress me up in cellophane
Rhythm of the oxygen
Galaxies invading
We are the universe
Chosen ones an amalgam
Orchestrate the gamelan
Asteroids parading
We are the universe
We are the universe
I'm a black hole majesty
The big bang fertility
Life begins when cells divide
And my womb is full of pride
Where the rockets fear to slide

Dress me up in cellophane
Rhythm of the oxygen
Galaxies invading
We are the universe
Chosen ones an amalgam
Orchestrate the gamelan
Asteroids parading
We are the universe
We are the universe
After lightyears in a cloud
Comets nurse the primal seed
One sperm destined in the crowd
To fertilize the earthly breed
I'm the peacock valentino
