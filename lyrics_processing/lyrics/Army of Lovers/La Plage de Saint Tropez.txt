The sky is blue and I love you
It's in your eyes you love me too
Where it never rains
We take a shower of champagne
Let's dance away let's go insane
Crying when I empty
My last bottle of chablis
I'll survive the winter of paris
Cars a la plage de saint tropez
A summer day I meet you there
I take your hand I say mon chere
And we're in love
Cars a la plage de saint tropez
We have a dirty love affair
And there is musique in the air
When we're in love
We drink lemonade
At the casino we get paid
Attend a midnight masquerade
Playboys on the run
We meet khashoggi with a gun
They say the two of us are one
You might also likeCrying when I empty
My last bottle of chablis
I'll survive the winter of paris
Cars a la plage de saint tropez
A summer day I meet you there
I take your hand I say mon chere
And we're in love
Cars a la plage de saint tropez
We have a dirty love affair
And there is musique in the air
When we're in love
Crying when I empty
My last bottle of chablis
I'll survive the winter of paris
Cars a la plage de saint tropez
A summer day I meet you there
I take your hand I say mon chere
And we're in love

We have a dirty love affair
And there is musique in the air
When we're in love
