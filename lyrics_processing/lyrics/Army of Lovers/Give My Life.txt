Give my life, give my life, give my life
To be in the book of love
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To gods above
When I go, when I go, when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life, give my life
The night I'm sacrified
I give my life
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To be in the book of love
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To gods above
When I go, when I go, when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life, give my life
The night I'm sacrified
There's a wizard who pampers the virgins
He's collecting a portion of blood
There's a blizzard when drowning the valley
Take the virgins away by the flood
You might also likeOn a mountain the wizard perfecting
He's collecting an ancient perfume
Every tear, every drop of the essence
Breaking hearts in the temple of doom
I give my life
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To be in the book of love
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To gods above
When I go, when I go, when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life, give my life
The night I'm sacrified
I give my life
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To be in the book of love
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To gods above
When I go, when I go, when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life, give my life
The night I'm sacrified
There's a castle the height of construction
There's a pipeline directing the stream
In a chamber a lizard extracting
To the godess a potion of dreams
At the top of the stair hail the axman
And the angels the peak of the scene
Pass the virgins on Army Of Lovers
Looking grand on a video screen
I give my life
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To be in the book of love
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To gods above
When I go, when I go, when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life, give my life
The night I'm sacrified
I give my life
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To be in the book of love
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To gods above
When I go, when I go, when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life, give my life
The night I'm sacrified
I give my life
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To be in the book of love
Give my life, give my life, give my life
To gods above
When I go, when I go, when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life, give my life
The night I'm sacrified
Give my life, give my life
