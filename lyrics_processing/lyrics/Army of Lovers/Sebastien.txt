Worlds apart his soul was torn
Killed though he could do no harm
Bless that heart Sebastien
Losing his virginity
Travel through infinity
Buried under astrakhans
Crucified Sebastien
Like sheep the dogs of stray
Monsignors on feet of clay
A meeting late at night
To escalate their fright
The stunning beauty of
A young monk with a glowing love
Kiss those virgin lips
A gift from high above
A serpent on a mission
The devil's passepartout
I hypnotize your vision
I throw my spell on you
Your physical appearance
Your life is in my hand
I crush your perseverance

I dwell in the experience
I tempt the sacred lamb
I tempt the sacred lamb
I eat the sacred lamb
From the day when he was born
Worlds apart his soul was torn
Killed though he could do no harm
Bless that heart Sebastien
Losing his virginity
Travel through infinity
Buried under astrakhans
Crucified Sebastien
The egos clash around
The cross to where the boy was bound
The chairman of the board
Strike the burning sword
The villains and the thieves
The body wrapped in golden leaves
Mashed his body down
The golden scent Sebastien
I tremble I'm euphoric
The stench of rotten fruit
The demons clap adore it
The abbots bathe in soot
The prince of fallen angels
I saw the grains of greed
An ancient Ronald Reagan
The vultures that I feed
I milk the naked pagans
I leave your heart to bleed
I leave your heart to bleed
And drink the virgin seed
From the day when he was born
Worlds apart his soul was torn
Killed though he could do no harm
Bless that heart Sebastien
Losing his virginity
Travel through infinity
Buried under astrakhans
Crucified Sebastien
A serpent on a mission
The devil's passepartout
I hypnotise your vision
I throw my spell on you
I'm in the top position
I tempt the sacred lamb
I tempt the sacred lamb
I eat the sacred lamb
From the day when he was born
Worlds apart his soul was torn
Killed though he could do no harm
Bless that heart Sebastien
Losing his virginity
Travel through infinity
Buried under astrakhans
Crucified Sebastien

From the day when he was born
Worlds apart his soul was torn
Killed though he could do no harm
Bless that heart Sebastien
Losing his virginity
