When I hear that sound, I know what's coming 'round
Thirty-nine degrees, too hot for the bees
The grass is turning yellow
Streets are slow and mellow
The faucet keeps on dripping
And the clock, it keeps on ticking

The swimming pool is laughing with its shiny, bright blue teeth
Laughing at my body as it's sweltering with heat
The smell of colored plastic baking in the sun
Sweet just like frustration, my senses on the run

I want your ice cream
I want it lying in the sun
I want your ice cream
I want it melting on my tongue
I want your ice cream
I want it, whatcha waiting for?
Ice cream, every bite
All I want is more

Ice cream

Filling up the car, the red door burns my thigh
How is this place still standing with temperatures so high?
Air and ground so heavy, thick with gasoline
My hands won't keep me steady, hotter than I've ever been

The swimming pool is laughing with it's shiny, bright blue teeth
Laughing at my body as it's sweltering with heat
The smell of colored plastic baking in the sun
Sweet just like frustration, my senses on the run

I want your ice cream
I want it lying in the sun
I want your ice cream
I want it melting on my tongue
I want your ice cream
I want it, whatcha waiting for?

Ice cream
You scream
I want your ice cream
I want it lying in the sun
I want your ice cream
I want it melting on my tongue
I want your ice cream
I want it lying in the sun
I want your ice cream
I want it melting on my tongue
