I had a dream last night I slept with someone else
Does that mean that I cheated on you?
It was amazing and I couldn't stop myself
Could it be that I really want to?
Well, if the things we feel count more than what we do
Guess what lover? I'm leaving

I don't wanna be that guy
Look you in the face and lie
But someone has to say it first
Even if the words may hurt

I only love you, I only love you
I only love you, only love you, only love you when I'm drunk
I only love you, I only love you
I only love you, only love you, only love you when I'm drunk

Don't get me wrong, last night I didn't change my mind
It was the drink, it was leading me blind
And when I kissed you it was such a big mistake
A couple drinks, that's the chance that I take
And if I can't control all of the things I do
I guess I better be leaving

But someone has to say it first
Even if the words may hurt

I only love you, I only love you
I only love you, only love you, only love you when I'm drunk
I only love you, I only love you
I only love you, only love you, only love you when I'm drunk
I only love you, I only love you
I only love you, only love you, only love you when I'm drunk
I only love you, I only love you
I only love you, only love you, only love

And I may be a little bit drunk, but I know what I've got to do
'Cause when I get a little more sober, I know I'll be over you
And I may be a little bit drunk, but I know what I've got to do

I only love you, I only love you
I only love you, I only love you
