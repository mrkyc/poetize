Comes on over, wants to drown his sorrows
Got a two-seater sofa and some whiskey in a bottle
Broken in tears with the weight of the world on his shoulders
"Oh my god, Sam, what's happened to you?"
Says his wife's just left with his 2-year-old daughter
To live in Acapulco with some idiot she only met a couple months ago
I wish I could tell you that

If it was me, I would be a good wife
I would never doubt you, ours would be a good life
And we could be better than so many
I would never stress you about bringing home the plenty
For all these things another life I'll have to wait
Would have been perfect if only God had wanted it
But you'll never know and when we'll get old
Let's not talk about it, rest your head upon my shoulder

You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know the good life
You'll never know the good life
You'll never know the good life

Somebody once told me that there are watchers and there are do'ers in this world
Guess I'm a watcher, not by choice
It's just what I was hurled
We're just two friends
It's not a risky situation
I wish I could tell you that

If it was me I would be a good wife
I would never doubt you, ours would be a good life
And we could be better than so many
I would never stress you about bringing home the plenty
For all these things another life I'll have to wait
Would have been perfect if only God had wanted it
But you'll never know when we'll get old
Let's not talk about it, rest your head upon my shoulder

You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know the good life
You'll never know the good life
You'll never know the good life

Rest your head upon my shoulder
(I'm too tired, you can see)
Now that life's a little colder
(I could love you simply)
And even if you'll never know
(Wouldn't leave if it was me)
My love will never run away like the sunshine
Good time friend not just the good times
For all these things another life I'll have to wait
Would have been perfect if only God had wanted it
But you'll never know when we'll get old
Let's not talk about it, rest your head upon my shoulder

You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know the good life
You'll never know the good life
