Walk through the city like stupid people do
A million faces, but all I'm seeing is you
I'm stopping strangers and telling them your name
Convincin' haters, one day they'll feel the same
We're common people, we're common people in love
It's supernatural, it's just a force from above
Some call me crazy, some try to make me shut up
If I am crazy, that's what you made me

I said you're the only one I wanna talk about
I said you're the only one I wanna talk about
I said you're the only one I wanna talk about
Yeah it's true, all I do is wanna talk about you

Walk through the jungle that used to be my town
Everything's different, you've turned it upside down
It happened to me, totally unprepared
Just the beginning, but I'm not even scared
Cause living like this is risking all that I know
And if it kills me, that's the way I wanna go
So pull me under, and put me under your spell
Rather be crazy, than normal people in hell
