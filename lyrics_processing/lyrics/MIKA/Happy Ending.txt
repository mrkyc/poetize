This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we love, like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life but not together

Wake up in the mornin', stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
Mm, a little bit of heaven, but a little bit of hell

This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope or love or glory, happy endings gone forever more

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I'm wastin' every day

This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending
This is the way that we love, like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life but not together

Two o'clock in the mornin', something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on

This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope or love or glory, happy endings gone forever more

I feel as if I'm wasted
And I'm wastin' every day
Oh, I feel as if I'm wasted
(This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending)
(No hope, no love, no glory, no happy ending)
And I'm wastin' every day
(This is the way that we love, like it's forever)
(Then live the rest of our life but not together)
