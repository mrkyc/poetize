Father, will you forgive me for my sins?
Father, if there's a heaven let me in
I don't know where to go if I should die
We haven't been on speaking terms for so long you and I

I was a freak since seven years old
Been cast away, I felt the cold
Coming over me
For every love I had to hide
And every tear I ever cried

I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you, please
There's no place in heaven for someone like me
Won't you open the door and try me once more?
Cause there's no place in heaven for someone like me
Cause there's no place in hell

In between a solution can be found
How long will I swim before I drown?
And in between those words we dare not say
Do you think that you could learn to love me anyway?

Father, won't you forgive me for my sins?

Father, is there any way to see
If there's room in heaven left for me?
