You think you're better, you're better than me
You blow me off as history
To avoid conversation, you're ignoring me

When you've had enough and you need somebody to know
Well, you're looking tough but you need a way to let it go
Come on now, what's a boy s'posed to do
When I can't seem to leave you alone
Touching me, touching you

I wanna be your brother, wanna be your father too
Never make you run for cover even if they want us to
I wanna be your sister, wanna be your mother too
I wanna be, wanna be whatever else that touches you
Whatever else that touches you
Whatever else that touches you

For fear of losing, losing your way
You stop and listen to the things that they say
To avoid confrontation, you walk away (hey, hey)

Growing up, found the need to compromise (hey, hey)
Well, I've had enough, 20 years and I realized (hey, hey)
Come on now, what's a boy s'posed to do (hey, hey)
When I can't seem to leave you alone
Touching me, touching you

This isn't a perfect love
One that we're guilty of
What am I supposed to do
I can't seem to leave you alone
