It's not the cowboys that are missing anymore
That problem was already old in '94
Don't be offended, this might seem a little wrong
Where have all the gay guys gone?

And to the romance when I was 14 years old
And to my heroes that were dressed up in gold
Only hoping one day I could be so bold
Where have all the gay guys gone?

If we are all in the gutter, it doesn't change who we are
Cause some of us in the gutter are looking up at the stars
If we are all in the gutter, it doesn't change who we are
Cause some of us in the gutter are looking up at the stars

So tell me
Where have all the good guys, where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys gone?
Where have all the good guys, where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys gone?

Thank you Rufus, thank you Auden and James Dean
