There's a party going on in here
It's been happenin' for many years
You weren't invited and don't want to stay
But keep partying anyway
DJ's playin' my familiar tune
Got them dancin', shakin' up the room
They hear the beat, but they don't know the words
This is the saddest song I've ever heard

Ooh
If you could look into the future, would ya?
If you could see it, would you even want to?
I've got a feeling that there's bad news coming
But I don't want to find it out

If it's the end of the world, let's party
Like it's the end of the world, let's party
Wrap your arms around, everybody
If we're all gonna die, let's party
Let's party, let's party
See MIKA LiveGet tickets as low as $75You might also like
Who can I blame with everythin' I've done?
Is this the price we pay for too much fun?
Don't be misled; it's not a twist of fate
It's just what happens when you stay out late
So raise your glasses, all my kings and queens
Smash the chandelier to smithereens
Who knew that mercury could rise so fast?
Enjoy the party 'cause this is our last

Ooh
If you could look into the future, would ya?
If you could see it, would you even want to?
Got a feeling that there's bad news coming
But I don't want to find it out

If it's the end of the world, let's party
Like it's the end of the world, let's party
Wrap your arms around, everybody
If we're all gonna die, let's party
If it's the end of the world, let's party
Like it's the end of the world, let's party
Wrap your arms around, everybody
If we're all gonna die, let's party
Let's party, let's party
Let's party, let's party

There's a party goin' on in here
It's been happenin' for many years
And even if it all goes bad
