Ooh, ah, ah
A-ah, ah, ah

Took a ride to the end of the line
Where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train
With nobody I know
But the pain and the longing's the same when you're dying
Now I'm lost, and I'm screaming for help alone

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire
Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?
Relax

Oh, there is an answer
To the darkest times
It's clear, we don't understand it
But the last thing on my mind
Is to leave you, I believe that we're in this together
Don't scream, there are so many roads left to run

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you


Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
Relax
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire
Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?
Relax

Ooh, ah, ah
A-ah, ah, ah
