She's a girl with a bag full of hearts and a devil's eyes
Crazy kids in the wild on the run to the county line
Shotgun for a tongue but says just what she likes
Oh, girl you're the devil
Oh, girl you got the devil inside

And I said follow me
Whoever you want to be
Don't care where you where you go
As long as you stay with me
And I said follow me
Whoever you want to be
Don't care where you where you go
As long as you stay with me

Oh, girl you're the devil
She's a bad bad girl
Oh girl you got the devil inside
A very bad girl
Oh, girl you're the devil
She's a bad bad girl
Oh girl you got the devil inside
A very bad girl
