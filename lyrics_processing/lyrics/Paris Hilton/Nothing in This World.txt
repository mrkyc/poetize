Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da

So I was thinking to myself when you pass me by
"Here's what I like"
And you were with somebody else, but you can't deny
That's me in your eye

Do you know what it's like
When it's wrong, but it feels so right?

Nothing in this world can stop us, tonight
I can do what she can do so much better
Nothing in this world can turn out the light
I'm gonna make you feel alright, tonight

Da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Tonight)
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da

Baby, you and I, we got what they'll never be
You know I'm right
So tell me what you're waiting for when you're here with me
Most guys would die
You might also like
You should know (You should know) what it's like (What it's like)
When it hurts (When it hurts), 'cause it feels so right

Nothing in this world can stop us, tonight
I can do what she can do so much better
Nothing in this world can turn out the light
I'm gonna make you feel alright, tonight

Da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Tonight)
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da

I gotta tell you something
It's something that you just might like
No, it's not the same thing
Yeah, you'll learn I'm not too shy
You and I, we can do this thing tonight

Nothing in this world can stop us, tonight
I can do what she can do so much better
Nothing in this world can turn out the light
I'm gonna make you feel alright, tonight
Nothing in this world can stop us, tonight (Tonight)
I can do what she can do so much better
Nothing in this world can turn out the light
I'm gonna make you feel alright, tonight
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Tonight)
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Tonight)
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Tonight)
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Tonight)
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
