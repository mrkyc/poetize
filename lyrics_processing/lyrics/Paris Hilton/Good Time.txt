Got my sexy girls with me
Oh, I love it

Whoa-oh, let's party

There go the paparazzi
I really don't give a fuck
Move out of my way
'Cause I came to party rock
Good times are here
And you know they're here to stay
If you're not here to party
Move and get out of my way

I'm fucked up, I can't tell you what's what
All she know is suck fuck
I walked up to a big butt, and ask her ass "Butt What?"
Tunechi never slacks without a button up

More money more problems
More money will solve them
It's YMCMB bitch
Paris, do you speak french? I get special treatment
Girl, turn over, good defense! We turned down for what
Tomorrow isn't promised
Tonight is all we got
And times like these are timeless
She fucked me like she love me
Love is such a science, do you think it's love?
