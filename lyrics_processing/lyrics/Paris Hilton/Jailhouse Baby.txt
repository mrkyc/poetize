CNN and MTV, all cameras focused on me
Helicopters up above, oh what a travesty
There's a crazy world at war
Right outside of my front door
They're wasting time on me
I'm just a jailhouse baby

Oh, I'm seen so sleepy
Oh, jailhouse baby
Oh, no window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jail bird
Oh, I'm seen so sleepy
Oh, jailhouse baby
Oh, no window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jail bird

Cold nights and freezing water, fluorescents always on
Stuck here behind this glass, my parents see their daughter
Judge you're no celebrity
You're a desperate wannabe
Service, you'd rather leave
Real criminals on the streets
You might also like
Oh, I'm seen so sleepy
Oh, jailhouse baby
Oh, no window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jail bird
Oh, I'm seen so sleepy
Oh, jailhouse baby
Oh, no window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jail bird

Hand cuffs and Coco cream, notes slipped right under my door
Look at me caught in this cage, just like an animal
Like a public enemy
Make a matter out of me
How dangerous can I be
I'm just a jailhouse baby

Oh, I'm seen so sleepy
Oh, jailhouse baby
Oh, no window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jail bird
Oh, I'm seen so sleepy
Oh, jailhouse baby
Oh, no window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jail bird
All those lonely nights of terror
I thank you for your letters
Words from around the world
For the lonely little jail bird
Still haunted by nightmares
Why's the system so unfair
But I'm stronger than before
No I'm no longer scared

Oh, I'm seen so sleepy
Oh, jailhouse baby
Oh, no window to the world
I'm a little, I'm a little jail bird
Oh, I'm seen so sleepy
Oh, jailhouse baby
Oh, no window to the world
