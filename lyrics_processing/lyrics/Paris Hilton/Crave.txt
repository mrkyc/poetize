I'm little Miss Missing You
Day and night its all I do
Dreaming about an empty bed with lonely sheets
Sleeping with the phone pressed against my cheek

I'm little Miss Missing You
All the colors fading into blue
Withdraws from your touches overwelming me
I want you to come home, express delivery

(Know what you want)
(know what you want)
(Know what you want)
I crave you
(Know what you want)
(know what you want)
(Know what you want)
I crave you tonight
(Know what you want)

(Know what you want)

How could I live, where would I go, who could I be
(Without you)
How could I cope, who would I see, what would I know
(Without you)
Who could I trust, how would I sleep, what would I do
(Without you)
How could I speak, how would I deal, come home to me
(I crave you)

I'm little Miss Missing You
I want you no one else will do
I carve you more than lollipops and chocolate
I miss your face I'm getting desperate

I'm little Miss Missing You
My eyes have never been so blue
I want you to come home you're the missing link
Our hearts are gonna beat in perfect sync
