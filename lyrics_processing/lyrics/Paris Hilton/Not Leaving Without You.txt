I got my eye on you, boy, I got my eye on you, boy
And when I get my eye on something, it's like search and destroy
There's no running away, not a game that I play
I wanna get to know you, so come on

We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
Come on, just move your body, come on, just move your body
We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
'Cause you're the one that I like

Don't ask me for my number, 'cause my number's undercover
Don't tell me that your going, I just got here and I'm hoping
I'm not leaving without you, I'm not leaving without you
So stop looking at the clock, 'cause baby, time's on my side
Tick tock, tick tock - soon you'll be mine
I wanna know things about you
I'm not leaving without you

We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
Come on, just move your body, come on, just move your body

So what you got on your mind? What you got? Don't hide
I need to know that there is something more to you then those eyes
I need someone who's sweet, someone who wants me for me
And when I'm not around, he's not gonna cheat
You might also like
We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
Come on, just move your body, come on, just move your body
We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
'Cause you're the one that I like

Don't ask me for my number, 'cause my number's undercover
Don't tell me that your going, I just got here and I'm hoping
I'm not leaving without you, I'm not leaving without you
So stop looking at the clock, 'cause baby, time's on my side
Tick tock, tick tock - soon you'll be mine
I wanna know things about you
I'm not leaving without you

We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
Come on, just move your body, come on, just move your body

I wanna know what you dream about
I wanna know what you're thinking now
I wanna know what you dream about
I wanna know what you're thinking now
And when the lights go down and you come around
Let me see what it's all about
I wanna know what you dream about
I wanna know what you're thinking now
I wanna know what you dream about
I wanna know what you're thinking now
And when the lights go down and you come around
Let me see what it's all about
I wanna know what you dream about
I wanna know what you're thinking now
I wanna know what you dream about
I wanna know what you're thinking now
And when the lights go down and you come around
Let me see what it's all about
I wanna know what you dream about
I wanna know what you're thinking now
I wanna know what you dream about
I wanna know what you're thinking now
And when the lights go down and you come around
