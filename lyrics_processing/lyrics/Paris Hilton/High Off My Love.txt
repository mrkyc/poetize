So you think I'm bad babe
And you keep acting like you want me
I don't need a little boy
You better turn it up just a little more

Keep my attention
I'm ready to go
My only intention's
To give you a show

Light it up
I know you want it
Take a puff
Let's get high off our love
High off our love

Do you wanna get
High off my love
High off my love
High off my love
Do you wanna get
High off my love
High off my love
High off my love
Do you wanna get
High off my love
High off my love
High off my love

I'm an alien
I'm on a Venus trip
You're from Mars, baby
(Let's kill this bitch)

The night is young
It's time to kill it
Let's turn it up
I know you really want it
I wanna see you
Go hard as you can
And let it show
You're making demands
Demands
Demands
Demands
Demands
Demands
Keep my attention
I'm ready to go
My only intention's
To give you a show

Light it up
I know you want it
Take a puff
Let's get high off our love
High off our love

So we taking off
Standing halo at the Birdman
I'm known to ball
Red Bugatti
It's time the man
And the money talk
Old money with new money
We fill our Hummer
Stretch the numbers
We do the numbers
We get the money
Every summer
'Cause we the ones to
Blow them hunnids
PH! Breh!
Do you wanna get
High off my love
High off my love
High off my love

High off my love
Do you wanna get
High off my love

Do you wanna get
High off my love
