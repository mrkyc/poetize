J.R

Excuse me, I think I've seen you the dance floor
Excuse me, I think there playing one of our songs
I've seen you, you been here alot of times
And you've been on my mind
'Cause, baby, you're just so damn fine

What do you say?
What will it take to make you see that I'm not playing?

I want you and I think you should know
I want you and I won't let you go
'Cause I'm the kind of girl who likes to tell you what I want in life
I'll get right up in your face, won't you like that anyway?
I want you, so before you go home and you leave me alone
I thought you should know

The nights young, and baby, I'm just getting started
So don't go, 'cause I'm feeling open hearted
And I could give you everything you need
You'll been living in dream, if you'll be waking up next to me
You might also like
Give me chance, how about a dance?
I promise you, you won't regret it

I want you and I think you should know
I want you and I won't let you go
'Cause I'm the kind of girl who likes to tell you what I want in life
I'll get right up in your face, won't you like that anyway?
I want you, so before you go home and you leave me alone
I thought you should know

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

When you looking like that and am I'm feeling like this
You make my head spin around and I want a kiss
When you looking like that and am I'm feeling like this
You make my head spin around and I want a kiss

What do you say? (What do you say?)
What will it take to make you see that I'm not playing?
I want you and I think you should know
I want you and I won't let you go
'Cause I'm the kind of girl who likes to tell you what I want in life
I'll get right up in your face, won't you like that anyway?
I want you, so before you go home and you leave me alone
I thought you should know

Na na na na na na na na
I want you, I want you
Na na na na na na na na
I want you, I want you
Na na na na na na na na
