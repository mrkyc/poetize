Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!
Froggy takes one step at a time
The way that he moves has no reason or rhyme
He hops and jumps, dodges and ducks
Cars and buses, vans and trucks!
Go, Froggy, go!
Ya gotta keep on hoppin' 'till you get to the top
Go, Froggy, go!
Ya gotta keep on hoppin'; you can never stop!
Go, go, Froggy, go!
Hiya, kids!
Froggy takes one step at a time
The way that he moves has no reason or rhyme
There's snakes and insects, otters and things
At times I wish Froggy had wings!
Go, Froggy, go!
Ya gotta keep on hoppin' 'till you get to the top
Go, Froggy, go!
Ya gotta keep on hoppin'; you can never stop!
Go, go, Froggy, go!

The way that he moves has no reason or rhyme
The diving turtles have fooled him again
I guess for old Froggy, it's sink or swim!
Go, Froggy, go!
Ya gotta keep on hoppin' 'till you get to the top
Go, Froggy, go!
Ya gotta keep on hoppin'; you can never stop!
Go, go, Froggy, go!
Ribbit
Froggy takes one step at a time
The way that he moves has no reason or rhyme
He rides on the logs all the way to the top
And into his cave with one final hop
Go, Froggy, go!
Ya gotta keep on hoppin' 'till you get to the top
Go, Froggy, go!
Ya gotta keep on hoppin'; you can never stop!
Go, go, Froggy, go!
