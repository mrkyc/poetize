At 17 she left Long Island
Bound for Hollywood
Another story like the ones
You've heard before
He left her broken like
You figured, like you knew he would
She shut her heart after his
Ring rang off the door

It's the story of your life
You're tearing out the page
New chapter underway
The story of your life
You live it everyday
You can run, you run
But you won't get away
I don't know what's coming up
Where will you go now
It's the story of your life

She hit the ground
She built a fine career
Every weekend walked her
Dogs beside the sea
In the salt she met a man who
Knew at once but wait
Is he the one we need him to be?

As the words begin to change
The story of your life
You live it everyday
You can run, you run
But you won't get away
I don't know what's coming up
Where will you go now
It's the story of your life

Look around look around and
The world will find you
Look around look around and
The world will find you
Look around look around and
The world will find you

There's a reason that we live
So far from Hollywood
In the country looking hard to find a home
We're nothing perfect
All considered
But we're so damn good
It's the story of your life
You're moving down the page
And you know you're on your way
The story of your life
You live it everyday
You can run, you run
But you won't get away
No one knows what's coming up
Where will you go now
It's the story
It's your story
