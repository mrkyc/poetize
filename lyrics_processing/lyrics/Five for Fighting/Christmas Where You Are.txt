There are stockings
Full and waiting
From sea to shining sea
Jingle bells are ringing
In keys of... liberty
Children celebrating
Santa and his sleigh
Of reindeer who found their way again
Across the home, home of the brave
'Tis the 25th day of December
In a season best to remember
That blessings and bows and mistletoes
Are not without tolls...
Guardian souls
A soldier has a soldier's duty
That takes no holiday
So because you're far from home this winter
There's one thing I'd like to say...

Thank you!
For the gift of freedom
That lights these Holy stars
Thank you!
For each & every Christmas tree
Across this sacred land of ours
May angels fly beside you
May heaven steel your heart
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face
It doesn't matter if you're near or far
It's Christmas where you are

Your chair is empty at the table
Still I take your hand
As we pray for peace in this small world
On our knees we stand
Of this body of this nation
You are the heart and spine
So to each great generation
Of heroes down the line...

Thank you!
For the gift of freedom
That lights these Holy stars
Thank you!
For each & every Christmas tree
Across this sacred land of ours
May angels fly beside you
May heaven steel your heart
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face
It doesn't matter if you're near or far
It's Christmas where you are

Every day is Memorial Day
Every day the 4th of July
Let all religions celebrate
The freedom that you provide
For if we stand together
We will never fall
Merry Christmas to the one I love!
Merry Christmas to one and all!
Thank you!
For the gift of freedom
That lights these Holy stars
Thank you!
For each & every Christmas tree
Across this sacred land of ours
May angels fly beside you
May heaven steel your heart
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face
When hopes seems a hundred miles away
Just close your eyes, and you will see his sleigh
It doesn't matter if you're near or far
