There was a man back in '95
Whose heart ran out of summers, but before he died
I asked him, "Wait, what's the sense in life?
Come over me, come over me"
He said, "Son, why you gotta sing that tune?
Catch a Dylan song, or some eclipse of the moon
Let an angel swing and make you swoon
Then you will see, you will see"

Then he said, "Here's a riddle for ya
Find the answer
There's a reason for the world
You and I"

Picked up my kid from school today
"Did you learn anything? 'Cause in the world today
You can't live in a castle far away
Now, talk to me, come talk to me"
He said, "Dad, I'm big, but we're smaller than small
In the scheme of things, well, we're nothin' at all
Still, every mother's child sings a lonely song
So play with me, come play with me"

"And hey, Dad, here's a riddle for ya
Find the answer
There's a reason for the world
You and I"
I said, "Son, for all I've told ya
When you get right down to the
Reason for the world
Who am I?"

There are secrets that we still have left to find
There have been mysteries from the beginning of time
There are answers we're not wise enough to see
He said, "You're lookin' for a clue? I love you free"

The batter swings, and the summer flies
As I look into my angel's eyes
A song plays on while the moon is high
Over me, somethin' comes over me
I guess we're big, and I guess we're small
If you think about it, man, ya know, we got it all
'Cause we're all we got on this bouncin' ball
And I love ya free, I love you freely
Here's a riddle for ya
Find the answer
There's a reason for the world
