When I wake up, people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
It's like that, y'all, y'all, but we don't quit
You keep on rock shock 'cause this is it (Woo)

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (Bum, bum)
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (Bum, bom)
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, huh

In New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really hawk, but we just walk because we have no time
And in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside (Woo)
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (Bum, bum)
