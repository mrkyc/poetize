About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night, and everything he sees is just blue
Like him inside and inside
Blue is his house with a blue little window and a bleu corvette
And everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen
(2x)
I'm blue
Da ba dee, da ba daa
Da ba dee, da ba daa
Da ba dee, da ba daa
Da ba dee, da ba daa
Da ba dee, da ba daa
Da ba dee, da ba daa
Da ba dee, da ba daa
I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color I bought and I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a boyfriend and he is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my corvette
It's in here all times
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me
