We can leave your friends behind
Cause' your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance, well they're
No friends of mine
Say, we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
And we can dance...
We can dance
We can dance
Everything's under control
We can dance
We can dance
Doin it pole to pole
We can dance
We can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance
We can dance
Everyone's takin' the chance
It's Safety Dance
Oh,what a Safety Dance
Yes, this is Safety Dance
Mommy's gettin' hot, gettin' wild
Gettin' out of control...
Big Daddy's gonna make you scream for more...
Turn up the base, no turn up the sax...
Sweet, sweet thing move it, move it...
Party people in the house do it, do it...
Like a geenie in a botle, gonna make one wish
And get your name on the top of mom's bitches...
Pop, rock, old school Ed's
Crazy people in that pimp's.web...
Like a song higher, ready or not
Signal that lady that you're on the spot...(freeze)
We can dance
We can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance
We can dance
Everyone's takin' the chance
We can dance
We can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance
We can dance
Everyone's takin' the chance
We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life, and mine
As long as we abuse it
Never gonna lose it
Everything will work out right
We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
Cause' your friend don't dance
And if they don't dance, well they're
No friends of mine
We can dance
We can dance
We can dance
We can dance
We can dance
We can dance
We can dance
We can dance
It's Safety Dance
Oh, what a Safety Dance
