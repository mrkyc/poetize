U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, "Oh my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat uh, u can't touch
I told you homeboy
(U can't touch this)
Yeah that's how we living and you know
(U can't touch this)
Look at my eyes, man
(U can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
(U can't touch this)
Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
You might also likeWhile it's rolling, hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, u can't touch
Yo, I told you
(U can't touch this)
Why you standing there, man?
(U can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka
(U can't touch this)
Give me a song, or rhythm
Make 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em
Now, they know
You talking about the Hammer, you talking about a show
That's hype, and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
Break it down
(Music breaks down)
Stop, Hammer time
Go with the funk, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, fun your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump
Yeah
(U can't touch this)
Look, man
(U can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know
(U can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
(U can't touch this)
Break it down
(Crazy bridge)
Stop, Hammer time
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
Break it down
(Nice pants, Hammer)
Stop, Hammer time
Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others making records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer"
And the rest can go and play
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
