Well, I always felt that I had quite a gift
As a judge of human character
This is the day and the time and the place
And I wonder, wonder where you are
Surely we set it for 3PM
Surely we said it was March the 10th

(Equator, equator)
You said you'd meet me there
You must be just around the bend

Well, all of the gifts are now melted or dead
And I'm sorry, sorry in advance
I'll make it up to you, that I can promise you
If I am given just half the chance
God, you'll be laughing, I look a mess
But you see I've been half way around this place

(Equator, equator)
You said you'd meet me there
(Equator, equator)
You said you'd be right there
(Equator, equator)
Oh, yeah
(Equator, equator)
Do-do-do-do
(Equator, equator)
Do-do-do-do-do-do
(Equator, equator)
Oh, yeah

You said you'd meet me there
You must be just around the bend

Well, I've got to stop here and rest for a moment
I'm sure that you're not far away
You always walked just as slow as you talked
Letting me think I could have my way
I wasn't fooled for a second, girl
I knew it was you who controlled our world

(Equator, equator)
You said you'd meet me there
(Equator, equator)
You said you'd be right there
(Equator, equator)
Oh, yeah
(Equator, equator) Equator, equator
Do-do-do-do
(Equator, equator) Equator, equator
La-da-da-da-da
Equator, equator (Do-do-do, do-do-do)
Do-do-do
(Equator, equator) Equator, equator
You said, you said, you said
(Equator, equator) Equator, equator
You said, you said, you said
(Equator, equator) Equator, equator
Oh, yeah

You said, you said, you said
