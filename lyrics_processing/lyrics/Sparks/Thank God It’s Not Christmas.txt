What do I hear? What do I hear?
Chit-chat and clinking glass
Cheap talk, a lady's laugh
After hours
What do I see? What do I see?
Some sunken hideaway
Where people go to play
After hours

There I'll spend the night
Meeting fancy things
At bistros and old haunts
Trying very hard to sin

Then it is day and in a way
The pattern's much the same
In-spots, a matinee
Every day
Blend with the crowd, blend with the loud
Hypnotic ebb and flow
Until the day goes slowly
Into night
You might also like
See the same old crowd
At bistros and old haunts
Till the lights grow dim
The not-so-subtle hint to be gone

Thank God it's not Christmas
When there is only you
And nothing else to do
Thank God it's not Christmas
Where there's just you to do
The rest is closed to public view

Caroling kids, caroling kids
A trifle premature
In tones so rich and pure
And crystalline
Call for the day, the popular day
It's fast approaching now
But will the mood allow
One dissent?

If this were the Seine
We'd be very suave
But it's just the rain
Washing down the boulevard
Thank God it's not Christmas
When there is only you
And nothing else to do
Thank God it's not Christmas
Where there's just you to do
The rest is closed to public view

Popular days, the popular ways
Are for the chosen few
Not meant for me and you
Obviously
Popular nights, popular rites
Great things to say and do
Aren't said or done by you
Obviously

If this were the Seine
We'd be very suave
But it's just the rain
