Hi, I was just noticing you, across the room
That's a really nice, pretty dress
Well, I saw you smiling, gee..
I've never seen you before, and I was wondering, you know, if you, like, you know...
Oh, no? Okay, well, never mind, see you later

Hey you, new wave, come over here
You're the prettiest thing I've seen all year
Hey you, new wave, don't turn away
Close those pouty lips and listen to what I say
Why must you smoke that clove cigarette?
Why must you act like you've got a hole in you head?
Tell me, tell me, why don't you split the squares and love me instead?

You're all shiny and clean, I've seen you in my dreams
Like the Rolls Royce I can't have, your presence makes me scream (Aaaah!)

Sour grapes, you leave such a bad taste
Sour grapes, I don't need you anyways
Sour grapes, feeding, feeding my rage
Sour grapes, sour grapes, sour grapes
You might also like
Hey you, new wave, well, I pity you
When you get old, what will you do?
What will you do when you turn 21?
You're cockteasing at the singles bar just for fun, yeah
Tell me, tell me, what will you do when you turn 31?
What will you do when you don't know how to love anyone?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

Well, I wanted her cherry, I got sour grapes
In a cute purple mini, you're just sour grapes
Well I refuse to climb the ladder for you (Sour grapes!)
No, I refuse to pant and paw for you (Sour grapes!)
I need love, don't need no beauty queen (Sour grapes!)
But still, when I look at you, I scream (Aaaah!)

Sour grapes, you leave such a bad taste
Sour grapes, I don't need you anyways
Sour grapes, just go riding right by me on the crest of the new wave
Sour grapes, feeding, feeding my rage!
