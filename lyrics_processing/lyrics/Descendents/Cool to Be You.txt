I don't believe in unity
It's just one more abandoned dream
Once the people get together it's easy to see
It's just a matter of time before they come after me

But it must be pretty cool to be you
With your brothers at your back protecting you
It must be pretty cool to know you belong
Isolated my whole life
Counting scars in the land of the smiling knives
Yes, I'm envious, its true
But it must be cool to be you

You've got a loving family
To give you everything you need
My family loves each other so much
We live a thousand miles away and never stay in touch

But it must be pretty cool to be you
With a home and a family to go home to
It must be pretty cool to know you belong
Isolated my whole life
Counting scars in the land of the smiling knives
Yes, I'm envious, it's true
But it must be cool to be you
You might also like
What can I do?
I know this bitter jealousy is wrong
Maybe I'll move and find a brand new place I don't belong
Some friends I'll never know
New places I can't go
Cause everywhere I've been is on the outside looking in

You've got a deep,sustaining faith
A lord who listens when you pray
I was raised in the church and I was told to believe
I wonder if God believes in me

It must be pretty cool to be you
With your holy faith sustaining you
It must be pretty cool to know you belong
Isolated my whole life
Counting scars in the land of the smiling knives
Yes, I'm envious, it's true
But it must be pretty cool to be you
It must be pretty cool to be you
