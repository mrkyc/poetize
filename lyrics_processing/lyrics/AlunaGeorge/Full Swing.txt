Droppin' all that dead weight
Light the candle in my head
Droppin' all that bad bass
Tearin' up my new frontier
Brushin' up my bit rate

Ready for anything
So let me hear the bell ring, light it up

Got my body in full swing
And my mind like a machine, light it up
Got my body in full swing
And my mind like a machine, light it up
Light it up now, light it up
Got my mind like a machine, light it up
Light it up now, light it up
And my body in full swing, light it up

Hold up for your count
Let go for the dance
Touch me like that Fendi
Let's get lost inside a trance
Step into my office
First lesson on me
Show a few moves that you just can't teach
Give you new highs that you just can't reach
So intense that you just can't speak
I've been a gentleman
I've been a gentleman, Black New Orleans
But we only get it started, don't take that seat
Woah, full swing, glad you on my tempo
Slow dance, let your feelings tip-toe
Starin' at your eyes, whole crystal
And you lookin' like Day, no Frisco
Old man teabaggin', no Cliff Notes
But you read through it, now we this close
No words 'cause our bodies are this close
Goin' full swing 'til it get old
You might also like
Ready for anything
So let me hear the bell ring, light it up

Got my body in full swing
And my mind like a machine, light it up
Got my body in full swing
And my mind like a machine, light it up
Light it up now, light it up
Got my mind like a machine, light it up
Light it up now, light it up
And my body in full swing, light it up

I, I, I, I
You're on my mind, bae you're comin' home
And I, I, I, I
Light up my life, when you're comin' home
I'm alive for you, I get high for you
I'm alive for you, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm alive for you, I stay high for you
I'm alive for you, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Got my body in full swing
And my mind like a machine, light it up
Got my body in full swing
And my mind like a machine, light it up
Light it up now, light it up
Got my mind like a machine, light it up
Light it up now, light it up
And my body in full swing, light it up
Got my body in full swing
And my mind like a machine, light it up
Light it up now, light it up
