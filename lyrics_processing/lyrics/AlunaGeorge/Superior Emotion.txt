Battle with my instincts
Evolution giving me the skills that I don't need
And these pills that I think I need
I feel like a wild one
Living in a violence
Stating my enviroment
And I just need a quiet mind
And I'm cool for a while
And I'm cool for a while
Then I'm looking for that high
Yeah, I'm looking for

Superior emotion
Obsessed with the mess and the feeling of devotion
That's what I want, but I know I don't need it
That's what I want and it makes me weak
Superior relations
It's a test of my faith, that sublime sensation
That's what I want, but I know I don't need it
That's what I want, that's what I want

You're something like a model
Something you could bottle
Fishing for a follow
But you need patience to love
You're wasting your modesty
Never had a back track from ago
Chase me once, then you'll know
Escape that you need
Not gonna fall without hope
