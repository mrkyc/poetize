Step on it like a taxi driver
Not gonna tell you which way to go
I'll just give you my destination
On the curves you can take it slow

I'm way ahead of you
Way ahead of ya, way ahead ya
So keep your eyes on the road
If I catch ya, if I catch ya
If I catch you in the rearview mirror
Don't let ya, don't let ya
Don't let your mind unfold

Kill the map but let the meter run
Kill the map but let the meter run
Get lost and ride into the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Don't matter where, don't care how
Get lost and ride into the sun
To the heartbreak horizon

Just want to feel the wind whip in my hair
You can work it out, how fast to go
Use some real life communication
Let me know what words don't show
You might also like
I'm way ahead of you
Way ahead of ya, way ahead ya
So keep your eyes on the road
If I catch ya, if I catch ya
If I catch you in the rearview mirror
Don't let ya, don't let ya
Don't let your mind unfold

Kill the map but let the meter run
Kill the map but let the meter run
Get lost and ride into the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Don't matter where, don't care how
Get lost and ride into the sun
To the heartbreak horizon
Kill the map but let the meter run
Kill the map but let the meter run
Get lost and ride into the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Don't matter where, don't care how
Get lost and ride into the sun
To the heartbreak horizon
Pain falls away 'til I
Can't find a way after
Heartbreak horizon
Take me there
Don't put the brakes on me
You know the way to the
Heartbreak horizon
Heartbreak horizon

Kill the map but let the meter run
Kill the map but let the meter run
Get lost and ride into the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Don't matter where, don't care how
Get lost and ride into the sun
To the heartbreak horizon
Kill the map and let the meter run
Kill the map and let the meter run
Get lost and ride into the sun
Let you know when we're done
Get me outta here right now
Don't matter where, don't care how
Get lost and ride into the sun
