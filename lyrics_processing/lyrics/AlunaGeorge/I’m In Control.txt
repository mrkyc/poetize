I'm in control

I like crashing waves
But I want to see them at first light
After a long night
And see the sky take shape
But I want to see the stars burn
After I've had my turn

And ooh, ooh
You're working so hard
You played your card
So what's the payoff?
And ooh, ooh
Big talk is cheap
You gotta go deeper than deep
To get me off

If you're picking up my call
Come and tell your boss you know that I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall
I'm in control, I'm in control
I'm in control

She a tell me she in control of mi love
Gyal get wet up when me turn her up

Love how she smile when mi worm crawl up

And, you no dead like nine night, gyal
Bubble like Champagne or Sprite, gyal
All night, me a give you love

And ooh, ooh
You're working so hard
You played your card
So what's the payoff?
And ooh, ooh
Big talk is cheap
You gotta go deeper than deep
To get me off

If you're picking up my call
Come and tell your boss you know that I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall
I'm in control, I'm in control
I'm in control
All night me a give you love
Get there...
Control of mi love
I'm in control
Hey gyal
Make sure you're in control of the boss
'Cause tonight me a take off your shorts
I'ma feel up the fat pum pum inna your drawers
Whole night me a watch you inna the dance
Oh God, me a pray for your legs like a fast
Gyal, you no favor no Halloween mask
Say you're in control, but me a the real boss, gyal
I'm in control

If you're picking up my call
Come and tell your boss you know that
'Cause she in control of the love
I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall
'Cause she in control of mi love
