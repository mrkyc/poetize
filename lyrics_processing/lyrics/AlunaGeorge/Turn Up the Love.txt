Whats up on the other side?
Is it greener, is it better, are we free?
What's up with the good fight?
Are we winning, is it brighter, can we see?
Some new stakes, some new stones
The bones buried in our broken homes, oh no (oh no)

Run it up, run it up
I swear it's simple, turn up the love
You can call my bluff
But I swear it's simple, turn up the love
Run it up, run it up
I swear it's simple, turn up the love
You can call my bluff
But I swear it's simple, turn up the love

(Hey!) I swear it's simple, turn up the lo-o-ove
(Hey!) I swear it's simple, turn up the love

What's up in your bubble?
Is it safe there, is it nice there, are you strong?
Oh, what's up, be the troubles
Are you solo, are you alone, the only one? (oh no)
Some use fire, some use waste
The ashes leave a bitter taste (oh no)
You might also like
Run it up, run it up
I swear it's simple, turn up the love
You can call my bluff
But I swear it's simple, turn up the love
Run it up, run it up
I swear it's simple, turn up the love
You can call my bluff
But I swear it's simple, turn up the love

(Hey!) I swear it's simple, turn up the lo-o-ove
(Hey!) I swear it's simple, turn up the love
(Hey!) Oh, no, oh-oh
I swear it's simple, turn up the lo-o-ove
(Hey!) Oh, no, oh-oh

Run it up, run it up
I swear it's simple, turn up the love
You can call my bluff
But I swear it's simple, turn up the love
Run it up, run it up
I swear it's simple, turn up the love
You can call my bluff
