I'm in control

I like crashing waves
But I want to see them at first light, after a long night
And see the sky take shape
But I want to see the stars burn, after I've had my turn

And ooh, ooh, you're working so hard
You played your card, so what's the payoff?
And ooh, ooh, big talk is cheap
You gotta go deeper than deep, to get me off

If you're picking up my call
Come and tell your boss you know that I'm in control, I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all? Put your hands against the wall
I'm in control, I'm in control, I'm in control
I'm in control, I'm in control
I'm in control, I'm in control

And ooh, ooh, you're working so hard
You played your card, so what's the payoff?
And ooh, ooh, big talk is cheap
You gotta go deeper than deep, to get me off

If you're picking up my call
Come and tell your boss you know that I'm in control, I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all? Put your hands against the wall
I'm in control, I'm in control
