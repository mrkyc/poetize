Some people want me to be heads or tails
I say no way, try again another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't play, letting my life get away

I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come, if they bring me down
Life can be cruel, if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun, don't tell me what can't be done

You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
Only because you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it but it drives you insane
What you want, what you gonna do?

If you wanna train me, like an animal
Better keep your eye on my every move
There's no need to be so damn cruel
Baby you got nothing to prove
You might also like
I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come, if they bring me down
Life can be cruel, if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun, don't tell me what can't be done

You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
Only because you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it but it drives you insane
What you want, what you gonna do?

(Drive)

You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
Only because you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it but it drives you insane
What you want, what you gonna do?
Drive you insane
