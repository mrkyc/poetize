Imma pull up, just to hop out and stunt
Errybody know wassup, ride on it
Pound in my cup
'Cuz you only live once
Feel the vibes on it
Imma go into my bag
Then imma go dive on 'em (dive on 'em)
'Cuz I've been down to do it all
Tell me what you got and
Imma pull up, just to hop out and stunt
And you gotta know it, know it, know it
Tell me what you got and
Imma pull up, just to hop out and stunt
And you gotta know it, know it, know it
Imma pull up

Party on Concord, you should pull up now
Errybody got a red cup, throwin' it down
We're tryna have fun and live life like it ain't no tomorrow
And Imma be here 'till the mornin'
You gon' be here when I'm callin'
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah yeah yeah
Pull up game too strong
I might hop out too fast
I don't know if I'll last
I do it just to stunt on your ex
You know a cool nigga up next
And Imma leave your bitch obsessed
She wanna fuck with me if she could
Cuz she know it's all good like the bottom of the net (Wet)

Yeah
Right on Concord, where you find me at
Party never end and we insomniacs
First tap the bottle then twist the cap
I do anything now to bring them times back
Just to feel like the world is yours
Same time, shorty you on all fours
She ain't mine, so we might all score
Same lines, you know them niggas all for it, same kind
You know what's goin' on at the crib, dawg
You left your girl, man you get it how you live, dawg
No problem, we can take it to the fists, dawg
Outside it's a big brawl
'Till a nigga let a big shot click off
Clear it out, then it's right back to what we do
My nigga in the city said he whipped five biddies
Anybody get a bottle and come through
True
Imma pull up, just to hop out and stunt
Errybody know wassup, ride on it
Pound in my cup
'Cuz you only live once
Feel the vibes on it

Then imma go vibe on 'em (dive on 'em)

And you gotta know it
