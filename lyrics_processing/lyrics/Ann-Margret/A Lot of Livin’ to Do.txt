There are chicks just ripe for some kissin'
And I mean to kiss me a few!
Then those chicks don't know what they're missin'
I got a lot of living to do!
Sizzlin' steaks all ready for tastin'
And there's Cadillacs all shiny and new!
Gotta move, cause time is a-wastin'
I got a lot of livin' to do!
There's music to play
Places to go, people to see!
Everything for you and me!
Life's a ball, if only you know it
And it's all just waiting for you
You're alive, so come on and show it
Yeah, we got a lot of livin' to do

There are men of nineteen or twenty
Handsome men from Yale or Purdue
Older men and I'm gonna find them
I got a lot of living to do
You might also likeI'm a'gonna have fun
Gonna be wild
Have my own way
I may break a heart today
Drink champagne
As if it were water
Pink champagne
And after a few
Daddy dear, you won't know your daughter

She's got a lot of living to do

Think I'll be a ring-a-ding drummer
Make each week a thousand or two
Gorgeous girls will beg for my number
Hey I got a lot of living to do
Yes I'm gonna break out
Gonna take off
Gonna be free
This town is awfully square for a cat like me
Or I'll be a super jet pilot
Fly me high way out in the blue
Then they'll see
I'm no shrinking violet
Hey I got a lot of living to do
(dance break)

I got a lot of living to do
There's music to play

Places to go

People to see

Everything
For you and me!
Life's a ball, if only you know it
Yeah it's all just waiting for you
Ah you're alive, so come on and show it
We got a lot of livin'
Such a lot of livin'
Tonight's the night we're gonna fly
Let's kick this hick town in the hide
I want a taste of everything
Let's live it up and really swing
Got a lot of living living living to do
