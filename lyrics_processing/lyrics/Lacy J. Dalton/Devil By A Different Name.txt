Call me whiskey, call me wine
Call me cocaine or codeine
Call me power, call me fame
I'm just a devil by a different name, boys
Devil by a different name

Call me left-wing, call me right
We are split right down the middle in this fight
Divided we fall, that rule don't change
It's just a devil by a different name, boys
Devil by a different name

This wicked world is dancing with the devil
In a wild and crazy hurdy-gurdy dance
Caught up in the frenzy and the revel
There's a dreadful price to pay for this romance

Call me imam, call me priest
We are brothers separated by belief
For the lawless faith is the ball and chain
It's just a devil by a different name, boys
Devil by a different name
You might also like
Call me brown-skin, call me white
It's not the color of our skin that makes us right
When somebody tells you we're not the same
That's just a devil by a different name, boys
Devil by a different name

There's a still small voice that whispers deep inside us
Listen close and you might hear it say
There's a light still out here shining in the darkness
It'll be here when you find you've lost your way

So call me gay, boys, call me straight
Must we stare across this chasm filled with hate
If they say we're wrong, we should be ashamed
That's just a devil by a different name, boys
Devil by a different name

This wicked world is dancing with the devil
In a wild and crazy hurdy-gurdy dance
Caught up in the frenzy and the revel
There's a dreadful price to pay for this romance-ance
I am a woman, I am strong
And I've been told that I am rust now for so long
Eve ate an apple? They say we're to blame
That's just a devil by a different name, boys
Devil by a different name, boys
Devil by a different, devil by a different
