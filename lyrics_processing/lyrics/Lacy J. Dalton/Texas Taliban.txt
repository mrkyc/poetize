I love the state of Texas, I truly am a fan
I love that outlaw music and Willie and the band
I got good friends in Texas and I don't hold them to blame
But seems of late the Lone Star State's a little off her game

But I still say God Bless Texas, God bless 'em to a man
Bless those Texas women like yer good ol' Governor Ann
One thing's got me trouble boys, I just can't understand
The pinhead politicians of the Texas Taliban

'Cause the Lord says love your neighbor, don't turn him in for cash
Hey, it ain't even Christian tempting folks to do like that
What about those Nazi's, that's how they used to act
You know darned well, they're all in hell and no one wants 'em back

Hey, and every living yahoo waving 'round his gun
Thou shalt not kill, but some fool will, the deed's as good as done
And everybody loves their gun, democrats, republicans
And I ain't one to spoil the fun, but what do we do with the crazy ones?

'Cause way down south in Texas, Bob Wills is still the king
Ya have Townes Van Zant and Waylon down where Lyle Lovett swings
Guy Clark, Kris and Janis, and Asleep at The Wheel
The politics are full of it, thank God the music's real

I never read a Bible quote, 'bout keepin' po' folks from the vote
I have heard though the Earth's a school, we're 'sposed to learn the Golden Rule
And doin' unto others, like you want done to you
It ain't just nice, it's good advice, you know by God it's true

And I still say God Bless Texas, God Bless 'em to a man
Bless those Texas women like yer good ol' Governor Ann
One thing's got me trouble boys, I'll never understand
