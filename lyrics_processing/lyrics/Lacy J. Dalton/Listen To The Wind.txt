Had a lover out in Santa Cruz
But I left him to sing the blues
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind
Thought that I'd left love behind
But love is just a state of mind
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind

Listen to the wind and the driving rain
Listen close and you'll hear 'em saying
That what goes 'round will come around again
Listen to the wind

I made a lot of music and it got me high
But Nashville left me high and dry
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind
I got so cold I almost froze
But something whispered to my soul
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind

Listen to the wind and the driving rain
Listen close and you'll hear 'em saying
That what goes 'round will come around again
Listen to the wind
You might also like
Everybody needs somebody to see them through
Everybody needs someone like I need you, I need you

The Sixties came, the Sixties went
We let the court appoint a president
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind
This old world's wild, she won't be tamed
The only thing you can trust is change
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind

Listen to the wind and the driving rain
Listen close and you'll hear 'em saying
That what goes 'round will come around again
Listen to the wind

Everybody needs somebody to see them through
Everybody needs someone like I need you, I need you

Had a lover out in Santa Cruz
But I left him to sing the blues
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind
Listen to the wind, listen to the wind
There's going to come a time in life when you think you've reached the end
And that will be the beginning

Listen to the wind
Listen to the wind
