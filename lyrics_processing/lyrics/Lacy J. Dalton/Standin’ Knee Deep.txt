There've been times in my life when I've felt out of touch and half crazy
Lost in a crowd with lovers and friends by my side
There's a numbness I've known all alone in some shimmering city
With bright lights around me and nothing but shadows inside
There've been desperate times when my heart was so dry
That I felt like my life was a curse

I was standing knee deep in the river and dying of thirst

There are months at a time when no reason nor rhyme can sustain me
When nothing makes sense and everything turns upside down
There are nights when I fight to keep dreaming from driving me crazy
And I shut off my mind just to keep it from spinning around
But it's down in that quiet in that stillness I find
The sweet water for which I've longed searched

While standing keep deep in the river and dying of thirst

So if you're having times when you feel out of touch and half crazy
Lost in a crowd with lover's and friends by your side
If the game's getting old and you're cold and exhausted and maybe
You'd just like to cop-out and crumble or lay down and die
If you come to a time when you need to decide
Friend, you might want to ask yourself first
You might also like
Am I standing knee deep in the river and dying of thirst?

'Cause there's a great river runs from the heart of the sun
Through the soul of the whole universe
From the limitless light that brings order and might
To the substance of heaven and earth
And it's down in that quiet, in that stillness inside
There's a well we don't seek 'til we hurt

From standing knee deep in the river and dying of thirst

Yes, down in that quiet, in that stillness inside
Are sweet waters to heal this whole earth
That is standing knee deep in the river
Standing knee deep in the river
