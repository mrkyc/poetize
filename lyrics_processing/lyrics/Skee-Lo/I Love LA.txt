Los Angeles, damn I love this town!
Sure feels good to be home!

Look, when you come to LA, you gonna see
The models cost money, but the hood rats are free
They're looking so good, I can't keep from cashing
I'm not drunk baby, but they're here for asking
They say "don't go to the park", I'm going anyway
I throw a real house party like I was getting played
And when this shit pops off, it happens everyday
Come to  where I stay, I love LA

Compton, Long Beach,  and 
Beaches on Sunday
Girl , sunsets,  hood lights hit me 
I love LA
I love it, I love it, I love it
Man, I love LA

Picture this, in this city we're deeper than be our best
Stackin' money to the ceiling is high, it's cannabis
We swole off butter, bread and grits
We like chicks with voluptuous lips and fast cars
Even though they like to make, love the stars
The close that I'mma get to prison is 16 bars
So if the cops try to stop us and the car ain't ours
I'mma step on the pedal, blast to Mars
I'm driving, no liquor, rolling more thicker
Your car run fast, my car run quicker
When you count your money from six to eight figures
Better watch your back for these haters and gold diggers
Out here they call me Indian chief, lots to go
Forget your man, he ain't gots to know
Isn't this great? your flight leaves at eight
My flight lands at nine in LA, we unwind!

As a kid I used to think that life was straight
I used to hang up in the projects stay up late
Some people, they make money, do whatever it takes
And I was thinking I ain't even try to push nowhere
I learn real from fake, I learn stress from shame
It's a real thin line betweem love and hate
This is why I wake up early so I don't be late
For the opportunities and the choices I make
All the hood rat chicks like the niggas with cars
All the good dime pieces like rich rap stars
Every brother that I meet will like 16 bars
Over anybody's tape so they can get their start
I'm searching for better days, I'm working for better pay
I need to change my life or go back to my old ways
I remember taking it back in the old days
Life move slow, we listen to OGs
Smoke Gs late in night inside of the hallways
The girls who are fresh, do perms and finger waves
High heels boots, Coach bags to match
South central girls make a real good catch
Only big ballers attract broads with big faces
Big dogs take big trips to all places
Take the blue pill or get out of the Matrix
You know what's going down today, I love LA
Compton, Long Beach,  and 
Beaches on Sunday
Girl , sunsets,  hood lights hit me 
I love LA
I love it, I love it, I love it
