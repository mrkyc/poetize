I'm wearing my favourite pyjama
Thinking bout that night
We went to rave in barcelona na na na na
Wish I could be back there sweating dancing
Give me little something give me little something
Make me feel like a young one
I don't even know how they're dancing anymore
But back in the 2010s
Back in the ends
Me and my friends
Me and the gang squad
Gassing the newest hasbro trend
Easy forget when you threw that thing away after twenty minutes
But every year you pick it up and that thing sends you
Round the bend round the bend round the bend
Bet you man can't beat my high score
Try and tell me this game is too boring
You don't know what your talking about
DJ mash up the floor
Bop it bop it
Twist it twist it
Pull it pull it
Shout it
Flick it flick it
Spin it spin it
Shake it
Pass it

You're out
Rozzi got this beat that's got me feeling all spagnolo
Telling me to bop it spin it come un pizzaiolo
Se non ti piace inglese te lo dico in italiano
Voglio ballare con te vorresti bop it con me
If you are ready then push the button
Like the sugababes push the button
If you can handle it push the button
Your finger's on the button
Don't need no one telling us what to do
Better respect the crew
We roll with the queens and the goons
DJ better be spinning my tune yeah yeah yeah yeah
Bet you man can't beat my high score
Try and tell me this game is too boring
You don't know what your talking about
DJ mash up the floor
Bop it bop it
Twist it twist it
Pull it pull it
Shout it
Flick it flick it
Spin it spin it

Bop it bop it
Twist it twist it
Pull it pull it

Flick it flick it
Spin it spin it
