Gather 'round cats and I'll tell you a story
About how to become an all-American Boy
Buy you a guitar and put it in tune
You'll be a rockin' and a rollin' soon

Impressin' the girls, hittin' hot licks, and all that jazz

I bought me a guitar a year ago
Learned how to play it in a day or so
And all around town it was well understood
That I was knocking 'em out like Johnny B. Goode

Hot licks, showing off, ah, number one

Well I practiced all day and up into the night
My papa's hair was a turnin' white
'Cause he didn't like rock and roll
He said, "You can stay boy, but that's gotta go"

He's a square, he just didn't dig me at all
You might also like
So I took my guitar, picks and all
Bid farewell to my poor old pa
I split for Memphis where they say 'you all'
And them swinging cats are a havin' a ball

Session, hot lick and all, they dig me

I rocking and bopping and getting all the breaks
The girls all said that I had what it takes
When up stepped a man with a big cigar
He said "Come here, kid, I'm gonna make you a star"

"I'll put you on Bandstand', buy you a Cadillac, sign here, kid"

I signed the name and became a star
Having a ball with my guitar
Driving a big, long Cadillac
And fighting the girls off'n my back

They just keep a comin', screaming, yeah, they love it
So I picked my guitar with a great big grin
And the money just kept on pouring in
And then one day my Uncle Sam says *knocking* "here I am!"
Uncle Sam needs you, boy, I'm, ah, gonna cut your hair off
