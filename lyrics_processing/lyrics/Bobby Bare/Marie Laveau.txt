Is Marie Laveau, down in Louisiana
There's a lot of weird ungodly tales about Marie
She's supposed to have a lot of magic potions, spells and curses....
Down in Louisiana, where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
Got a black cat's tooth and a Mojo bone
And anyone who wouldn't leave her alone
She'd go another man done gone
She lives in a swamp in a hollow log
With a one-eyed snake and a three-legged dog
She's got a bent, bony body and stringy hair
If she ever seen why'all messing round there
She'd go another man done gone
And then one night when the moon was black
Into the swamp come handsome Jack
A no good man like you all know
He was looking around for Marie Laveau
He said Marie Laveau, you handsome witch
Give me a little a little charm that'll make me rich
Give me a million dollars and I tell you what I'll do
This very night, I'm gonna marry you
Then It'll be another man done gone
So Marie done some magic, and she shook a little sand
You might also likeMade a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled, and she said Hey, Hey
I'm getting ready for my wedding day
But old handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie
You're too damned ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started mumbling her fangs started gnashing
Her body started trembling and her eyes started flashing
And she went another man done gone
So if you ever get down where the black trees grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
If she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man, you better stay with her for the rest of your life
