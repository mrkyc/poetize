Here we go singin' in the kitchen all together now singin' in the kitchen
Everybody singin' in the kitchen bangin' on the pats and pans
Mommy and daddy singin' in the kitchen baby laughin' singin' in the kitchen
All the kids singin' in the kitchen bangin' on the pats and pans
Supper's done and table's clear baby wants a bottle and I want beer
Lord I sure am glad I'm here where there's lotsa love to share
And I clap hands and everybody sings dishes cling and banjo rings
There's gravy on these guitar strings but I don't really care
Cause here we are singin' in the kitchen all together now singin' in the kitchen
Everybody singin' in the kitchen bangin' on the pats and pans
I'll play the comb and you'll play the spoons
I'll sing the words and you'll sing the tunes
We'll wake up the old Man in the Moon cause we sing so loud yeah
I'll hug ya all and you'll hug mother snuggle up close to one another
Just like bread on a piece of butter Lord it makes me feel so proud
Cause here we are singin' in the kitchen all together now singin' in the kitchen
Everybody singin' in the kitchen bangin' on the pats and pans
Now the fireplace embers're glowin' red everybody's tired and it's time for bed
Baby's noddin' his sleepy head so let's sing quiet now
What do we love (singin' in the kitchen) can't get enough (singin' in the kitchen)
Whole lotta love singin' in the kitchen bangin' on the pats and pans
Mommy and daddy (singin' in the kitchen) a little bitty baby (singin' in the kitchen)
All the kids singin' in the kitchen bangin' on the pats and pans
