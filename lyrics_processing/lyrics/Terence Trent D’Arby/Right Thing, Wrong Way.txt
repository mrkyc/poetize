'cause I know ya'll will know what I am talkin' bout here today...
Now dig...
Let me tell you about a girl I know
Every time I let my feelings show
I sing this same old song...
OW! Listen to me people...
How come every time I try to put my best foot forward
All I wind up doing is putting it in my mouth
Somebody's got to tell me...
I keep trying to do the right thing
But I keep doing it the wrong way...
Every time that I try to win her lovin'
I keep doing it the wrong way...
I send her flowers - she starts to sneeze
I didn't know that she had allergies
(oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I told her I apologize...and I'll make it up to you
Listen to me!
'Cause I was tryin' to do the right thing
But I keep doing it the wrong way...
Every time that I try to win her lovin'
I keep doing it the wrong way
You might also likeA 4 course meal - she called it a snack
I even took her to my crib, and she called my place a shack!
(oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I tried to please the kind of girl...
Whose tastes are particular
Man, this girl's about to break my back!
I keep trying to do the right thing
But I keep doing it the wrong way...
Every time that I try to win her lovin'
I keep doing it the wrong way
I keep on trying to do the right thing
Yeah! Yeah!
But I keep...
But I keep...
But I keep...doing it the wrong way...
Every time that I try to win her lovin'
I keep doing it the wrong way

Don't you know that...

Oooh!

The top was down on lover's lane

And she agreed to see me once again...
But this time she brought her UGLY friend!
