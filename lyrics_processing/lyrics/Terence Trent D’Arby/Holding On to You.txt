A girl who burned my thoughts like kisses
She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat painted lips on a live wire beauty
A tangerine girl with tambourine eyes
Her face was my favourite magazine
Her body was my favourite book to read
They say that all poets must have an unrequited love
As all lovers must have thought provoking fears
But holding on to you means letting go of pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you
I left the rough side for a seaside baby
A chamomile smile that pouts on cue
For every moment I breathe her sigh
Her bosom contains my sweet alibi
In an emotional mist she breathes in fog
And breathes it out as garden flowers
Why me of all the tough talking boys?
I guess she heard my heartbeat through the noise

As all lovers must have thought provoking fears
But holding on to you means letting go of pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of the rain
Holding on to you
Means letting sorrows heal
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you
They say that all poets must have an unrequited love
As all lovers I'm sure must have thought provoking fears
But holding on to you means letting sorrows heal
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you
I left the east coast for a west coast beauty
A woman who burned my thoughts like kisses
She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat wet lips on a sea salt canvas
Goodbye Picasso hello Dali
The soil is fertile where her footsteps trod
She's my new religion she's all I got
They say that all poets must have an unrequited love
As all lovers I'm sure must have thought provoking fears
But holding on to you means letting go of pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Means letting sorrows heal
