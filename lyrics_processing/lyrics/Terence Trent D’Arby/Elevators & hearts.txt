I guess that's just how it goes
But listen up

Snoopin' around around town
Like a help to give her yeah yeah
From my point of view
I'll guess it's only in the way you love her
I guess I'm gonna have to climb on up
(Climb on up, climb on up, climb on up)
In the elevator to her heart
(Climb on up, climb on up, climb on up)
Climp on up in the elevator to her heart
(Climb on up, climb on up, climb on up))
Spread my name shift the blame
To can blame to safe pain yeah
But where I have been
It depends on who I ask the strangest frames

From where I stand I need sittin' if I didn't believe it
