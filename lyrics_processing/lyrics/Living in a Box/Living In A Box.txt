(Woah)

Woke up this mornin' closed in on all sides
Nothin' doin'
I feel resistance as I open my eyes
Someone's foolin'

I've found a way to break through this cellophane line
'Cause I know what's goin' on in my own mind

Am I livin' in a box?
Am I livin' in a cardboard box?
Am I livin' in a box?
Am I livin' in a cardboard box?
Am I livin' in a box?

Life goes in circles, around and around
Circulatin'
I sometimes wonder, what's movin' undergroun'?
I'm escapin'
