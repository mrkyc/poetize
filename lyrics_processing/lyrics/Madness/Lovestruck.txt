Staggering home, the headlights throw a shadow up and upon
Friends and loved-ones that have done no wrong
But no longer mean anything to me

Oh am I mumbling on, into a crystal glass that echoes a song?
The enticement invites you along
A path of exterior colour

But come the morning, shivering and contorting
To border on the brink for just another sink - oh take me down
For one more round
Oh, involve me in libations, stick a rock in my foundation
Pickle my relations, put me on probation - Oh I'll take you down
For one last round

Oh, Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings
Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings
Now all I want to do is snuggle up to you
A night-cap in the early morning dew

Look, what have I become? Distancing myself so far and from
But gazing up, I wave the night boat on
For now it's heaven in deepest Tottenham

Oh, what have I done to deserve this fate? It's all gone wrong
Even my cab fares has been and gone
And now I'm lagging in deepest Tottenham

But come the morning, shivering and contorting
To border on the brink for just another sink - oh take me down
For one more round

Yeah, Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings
Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings

Frightening, frightening, strike me down with lightning
I've given in to fighting
Now all I want to do is get closer to you
A night-cap in the early morning dew
Oh, Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings
Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost
Giving her my utmost, spilling out my deepest feelings
Lovestruck, I've fallen for a lamppost
I'm giving it my utmost, I've fallen for a lamppost
With my deepest feelings
Now all I want to do is snuggle up to you
