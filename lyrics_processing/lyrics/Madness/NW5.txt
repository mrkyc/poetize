Only to despise
I've seen the madness stack up through
Tarpaulin eyes
I have heard you come up
Believing your own lies
Witnessed the blessing rise up in a
A very strange disguise
And though you have become a burden
One thing remains, that's for certain
I will love you all my life
But without you in my life
Yes I watched you climb up
I've seen you come alive
From them very humble beginnings in
NW5
And though we face the final curtain
One thing remains, that's for certain
I will love you all my life
But without you in my life
I would give you everything
For just that smile you bring
For just the song to sing
I would give you everything
For just that smile you bring
For just the song to sing
I sing now

Only to despise
Witnessed the blessing rise up in a
A very strange disguise
Nothing, it seems, lasts forever
People change just like the weather
Some for good and sometimes never
I hope things work out for the better
'Cos I would give you everything
For just that smile you bring
For just the song to sing
I would give you everything
For just that smile you bring
For just the song to sing
Nothing, it seems, lasts forever
People change just like the weather
Some for good and sometimes never
I would give you everything
For just that smile you bring
For just the song to sing, oh
I would give you everything
For just that smile you bring
For just the song to sing
I would give you everything
For just that smile you bring
For just the song to sing
And I would give you everything
