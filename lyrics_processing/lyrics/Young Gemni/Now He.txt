So much pain my heart hurt, seen my homie a day ago now he in a hearsh, his mom crying cause now he on a white shirt, they pop him like a perc, cause he got caught lacking now he dirt, 2x

Remember when you was homeless, mama took you in, we was not rich this time no, we didn't have no banz, i was 9 years old I would always rap to you in yo friends, yall was closest to fanz
You told me you want to see me grow, we was playing i called you a boy, and you called me a Nigro
But we never seen color, we was just like brothers, yeah we fight a lot but we was closer
You taught me how to rob you taught me how to shoot, and I took that In vanish and I pop you, but you shoulda neva told me what to do, so you was in the wrong to, 
Damn you taught me da rules, you said to get killed or be killed, it took me a long time to think, fuck it imma go kill there go the deal, cut off yo lights you forgot to pay da bills
But you was thinking the same, you up yours so I up mine, bow I took yo mind
So much pain my heart hurt, seen my homie a day ago now he in a hearsh, his mom crying cause now he on a white shirt, they pop him like a perc, cause he got caught lacking now he dirt, 3x

We want you dead
So we ain't shooting yo legs
