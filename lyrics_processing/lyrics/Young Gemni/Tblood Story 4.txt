Thx to quarantine I be trapping more den i be rapping

"thx to the court room I be telling the truth more den I be lying"


I rob from you so I can do the time
I only shoot you cause you want me to die
I made the wrong person mama crying
All my brothers gonna slide
If I die
They gonna raise hell every night
Its gonna feel like a spell every time
Crime after crime after crime
No more good life cause some one family member just die
But they only had 1 choice it was to slide or die
Now they in the air fly
I don't smoke but I feel high
"I don't smoke but I feel high"
Niggas said they looking for me I promise I ain't that hard to find
Talk to me wrong I promise it ain't that hard to die
Bullet come out when it want I promise it ain't shy
Yall bitchs yall niggas never slide
Yo niggas never ride
He hurd gun shots and dat nigga cry
I'm bout to make head line
Pull up to yo funeral and tell yo mom I'm glade her son died
Mama don't worry about me I'm fine
Trynna stay outta trouble but they keep getting in my mind
Tblood grandma died
Ha that makes me happy every time
It been a whole year they never slide
I guest they died

I was in that field I know a lot of soldier that died in that field
Why you at home crying they killed yo brother
They put him 6 feet under
You berried him
You showed him da life style so you basically carried him
You getting judge at the end
Not him he not old enough to understand
Now yo mama hate you
She gave her money to her boyfriend to bake you
Have someone on the streets to shank you
Gotta stay away from yo family
Don't know who out there to get you
"Don't know who out there to get you"
You like fuck everybody
You can't trust everybody
You grab the Glock you shot yo self now yo mama at yo funeral
Crying
You big dummy you should been trying
