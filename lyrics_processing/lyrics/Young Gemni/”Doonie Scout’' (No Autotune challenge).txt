Nigga talking tuff but ain't shooting
Got a Glock on my lap while cruzzin
I shot him on accident he was bleeding
Nigga got the flu he keep sneezing
Yeah like everyday got a bad bitch on me
Yeah just like Cardi she always horny
Wait till I give Cardi B the D she gonna turn into a C
No disrespect to 6ix but I ain't singing no plea
Yeah I was there but I couldn't see I was sleep
I ain't good at grilling so imma burn the beef
(I ain't good at grilling so imma burn the beef)

{Verse 1}
Okay this bullet gonna knock off his rainbow weave
Shot him in the throat he turning BlueFace he can't breath
Who know CPR don't save him he ain't suppose to live
Who know CPR don't save him he ain't suppose to live
When you hear my bullets you better dip
I shot him in the hip now he walking like a Crip
Just like kylie Jenner I shot him on the lip
Only difference it ain't made his lip big
Barrie you in the yard watch the PD dig
Told 5 let me clean up I don't wanna look like a pig
I don't wanna take it back I did what I did
Matter a fact I wish I did it again
Judge if I do it again will you give me a hand
You might also likeTake me to Judge Judy I wanna slap the bitch
It took me 2 years I'm rich
Don't need auto-tune I still made a hit
Don't need mmm I still made a ight
Gotta gun but I still fight
