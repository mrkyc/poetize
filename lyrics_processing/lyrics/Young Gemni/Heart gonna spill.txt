{Verse 1}
Had rough days as a kid ain't gonna lie
Mama tried her best for us to survive
I'm young but think of suicide
Wondering if da lord will ever let me die
I ain't talking no drugs when i say i wanna get high
I ain't talking no plane when i say i wanna be in da sky
I ain't talking shy when i said i don't wanna look you in da eyes
You did dirt to me
I did dirt to you
I gusset we are equal
I can't even speak to you
You point da to my face you press da trigger i can neva forgive you
If i was a street baby will you still love me
If i was a run away would you hide me
Thy hate me
Thy try to change me
I'm real on these street
Lil boi think he actually gangbanging on these streets
He not going to stop til he get bang on these streets
Same niggas you say you rockin wit be da same niggas be leaving you bleeding on da streets
If a nigga run up on you
Is thy going pull da trigger for you

Lately i've been feelin disrespect
Feelings getting wet like a lady on a sextape
Ex mad cuz she can't loss wait
I wish i was 8 all over again
Im glad im da man
Yo girl know im da man
When i get done she can go back being a fan
She gotta have a lil tan
Brain scramble like eggs on da frying pan
Drugs did it might
Catch a nigga slipping on sight
Tim to fight
Feelings dark at night
Pick up da pan start to write
Forget to type
Doesnt matter whats da hight
