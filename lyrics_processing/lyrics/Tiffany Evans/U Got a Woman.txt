So far from a girl
Whatever you need, boy
I'll here to please
I hope you won't tell
I know what you want
Let me be your supplier
However you are

Straight up and round
Even though I'm ours
I still gotta find ways to teach ya
I ain't playing when I said I been here before
I ain't playing when I said that you are the one
You got a woman, baby

Get you one more time when I come around
