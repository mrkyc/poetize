I rember when you you,you
You used to hold me
Like it's all you
You could do
When I think about a man
Tears, tears, fall down
Why did you have to go and
Let me, let me, me down

Baby you, were the key
Key to my heart
I just know that we never
Ever could part
Baby, come back to me
If you love me, love me
Never, never leave me
Leave me, leave me oh bay
If you love me, love me
Never, never leave me
Leave me, leave me baby

See look what you done
Got started, started and
You got me on the run
Here, like I lost it, lost it and
I would never let you go
All we have to do is try
You don't even know
What you're mad for
Tell me why
(Why are you far away)
Oh, 'cause whatever it is
I've got it for you baby
You might also like
You are the key
The key to my heart
And I just know that we never
Ever could part
Baby, come back to me
If you love me, love me
Never, never leave me
(You will never leave babe)
Leave me, leave me oh baby
(You will never leave baby)
If you love me, love me
Never, never leave me
Leave me, leave me baby

Oh Lord I'm praying to you
Give me a peace of mind
So I'll pull through
Mend my heart from all the pain
'Cause I know if he loves me
Then he will remain

If you love me, love me
Never, never leave me
Leave me,( i know i know you'll never leave)
Leave me oh baby
If you love me, love me
Never, never leave me
Leave me, leave me
