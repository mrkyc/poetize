Oh yeah-yeah-yeah
Boy...
I bet you never had it like this before
Oh yeah
But I'm sure that you think you have
Cause them other girls lied to you

I'm not usually the one to brag
But you wrong to make a right for you right, right
Oh, I can be the one to raise up your score

Oh they know you over there? (oh they know you over there?)
Yeah that's me, all me
Now you rocking different gear
That's me, all me

Oh, I can put you on, I can put you on
(P-P-P put you on)
Let me put you on, let me put you on
If it's what you want, show you the love you never seen before
All me, all me
I can put you on
(P-P put you on)
