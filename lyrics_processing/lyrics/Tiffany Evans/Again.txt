Oooooobabe, babe, babe
Summer winter, spring and fall
This keeps running in my head
Tell me what is going on
Is there a chance for us again
And is this really worth our love
Baby can we work it out
All I really wanna know
Can we fall in love again

It's been a year and 20 days boy
And somehow it ain't the same
No holdin hands no hugs
To show you care
Don't understand just how
It got this way yeah
Try to call
But you don't anwser me
Go by your house
But you don't wanna see me
What can I do
What can I say
Just wanna know can we fall in love again
You might also like
Boy what I gotta tell to say it the same
Boy at least try tell me your all
All we gotta do is just get together
And try to work out our situation

Summer, winter, spring and fall
This just keeps running thrpugh my head
Tell me what is going on
Is there a chance for us again
And is this really worth our love?
Baby can we work it out
All I really wanna know
Is there a chance for us again

And you know I really wish this was a dream
We could turn back time
I really wish that we could start again
So we can laugh and smile
With our friend
All the crazy things we did to fall in love again
Said I can't make it boy
I try to hide it
But it really shows
I miss your love
I miss your voice
We can be like were back then
Boy what I gotta tell to say it the same
Boy at least try tell me your all
All we gotta do is get together
And try to work out our situation


I'm really thinkin you don't know this
I'm really thinking you don't care
I'm thinking your not down for me
The way I'm down for you
Boy don't you know that this is hard
And the storm is just too rough
Though I don't wanna let you go
I can't stay in love with you
You can think what you want
I probrably should'ntsing these songs
If only I had siad it more
I love you I love you boy
