We were chillin' in the hallway
Waitin' for the bell to ring
Then walking to class late
We had no intentions on payin' any attention
Throwing notes across the room
End up in detention
Hiding from the teachers
Up under the bleachers
First make-out experience where I got experience
Someone stood and counted
While others scored in bathrooms
Oh, what I would give to go back to that
Last night
Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinking it's a shame that everything changes
Wish everything I knew could stay the same just like they were
'Cause change is overrated
Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinking it's a shame that everybody changes
Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were
'Cause change is overrated

I'm home on a week Christmas vacation
Ran into Michelle the head cheerleader
She's three months pregnant
And our high school quarterback
Got paralyzed in an accident
He was on his way to the NFL
Whatever happened to our valedictorian
Heard she had a break-up or some mess the second year
I hope she pulls it together and wish I could help a friend
I wish I could reverse the hands of time
Go back again
Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinking it's a shame that everything changes
Wish everything I knew could stay the same just like they were

Wish everything I knew could stay the same just like they were

Thinking back to my past
I wouldn't change a thing
Probably do everything exactly the same
Given the opportunity to live it over again
I would cherish every moment
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
Somedays I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
Somedays I sit and wish I was a kid again
