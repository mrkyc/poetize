Ay-hey, ay-hey
You were the best at everything you do
You only come second in telling the truth
Fast enough to catch a speeding train
Brave enough to step right through a flame
But when it comes to love, babe
You lose, you lose
'Cause every time I try to find a reason why
You just can't get it right for me
You give me stupid lies
You make me want to fly
You're powerless to me
'Cause I hate the way you're so good at saving the day
When it comes to me
You always come a second too late
While our love's going up, up, up and away
You won't save this Lois Lane
You won't save this Lois Lane
Ay-hey, ay-hey
You won't save this Lois Lane
Ay-hey, ay-hey
You won't save this Lois Lane
You might also likeYou're the smartest man that I know; yes, you are
The dumbest thing about you though
Is you don't even have a heart
How could you leave me under?
I was your backbone
When you pushed me down to my weakest
And baby, it's the last time
Last time
'Cause every time I try to find a reason why
You just can't get it right for me
You give me stupid lies, you make me want to fly
You're powerless to me
I hate the way you're so good at saving the day
When it comes to me
You always come a second too late
While our love's going up, up, up and away
You won't save this Lois Lane
You won't save this Lois Lane
Ay-hey, ay-hey
You won't save this Lois Lane
Ay-hey, ay-hey
You won't save this Lois Lane
You always leave me hanging, yeah
When I need you the most
Solving everybody's problems
Falling short of your own
And I hate the way you're so good at saving the day
When it comes to me
You always come a second too late
While our love's going up, up, up and away
You won't save this Lois Lane
You won't save this Lois Lane
Ay-hey, ay-hey
You won't save this Lois Lane
Ay-hey, ay-hey
