To the B, to the B, to the B
'Cause I need
Everybody to the floor, why?
Cause this beat is sick, yeah
It's time to rock, uh, that's what it is
Tiffany's her name
Love is the game
And the only way to play is with this promise ring

Sometimes a girl needs to know that shes
Appreciated for all the things she does
With some sorta token of love
Cause without it her young heart won't know
(Heart won't know)
And right then to my surprise
He pulled out a small velvet box
Pink ribbon tied
I'm wondering what's inside
He opened it and then he replied

He said
I promise not to hurt you
I promise not to lie
I promise to befriend you
And defend you with my life
I promise you forever
I promise you today
He said, "Would you wear my promise ring?"
I said yes
You might also like
If you break your promise, we breakin' up
Got a couple things that I want
Walks in the park and sweet things
If I rock your promise ring
I could be your pretty young thing
You could become my king
I gotta know you got me
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring

How in the world could a girl say no?
I knew it the moment he made my finger glow
It was good to know I'm who he chose
It was your heart he felt now it shows
(Now it shows)
You know when you see me floss
No way it's gon' get lost
I'll never take this off
I'm older and they call me by your name
I'll wear it on a chain because I can hear you say
He said
I promise not to hurt you
I promise not to lie
I promise to befriend you
And defend you with my life
I promise you forever
I promise you today
He said, "Would you wear my promise ring?"
I said yes

If you break your promise, we breakin' up
Got a couple things that I want
Walks in the park and sweet things
If I rock your promise ring
I could be your pretty young thing
You could become my king
I gotta know you got me
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Everybody get up and rock to this beat
My name is Tiffany, and y'all know me
All my girls with me, all the boys like me
Come correctly with the promise ring
And you (and you) just might be my boo, my boo

Promise that you'll never let me go
And boy, I'll
Boy I'll wear your promise ring
All you have to do is say the word and boy I'll
Boy, I'll wear your promise ring
Just let me know
Just let me know
What I gotta do?
Just let me know
Just let me know
You ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere
I'll be on for sure
But you gotta know that

If you break your promise, we breakin' up
Got a couple things that I want
Walks in the park and sweet things
If I rock your promise ring
I could be your pretty young thing
You could become my king
I gotta know you got me
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
