Yes, yelling to the light beat, and
It's B-Dub and Tiffany, and
We are in the place to be, and
We came in to move your feet, and
Get things jumpin' like they supposed to
Teen magazines
We jumpin' right out the posters
Can't believe what ya seein'? Then look closer
I know you can't believe she gettin' older

She's just a teen
So how could she really know what she wants?
I can't believe you'd think I'd run and tell you're mean to me
When it's really like She mean ain't she
I know just what you think
You're so stuck in the past like stone-washed jeans
And I can endorse anything through me
I'm flyer then you'd ever thought I'd be

You wonder why I'm so cold
You coulda been more involved, but no
I'm not the girl that you knew before
I can't believe you didn't know I'm grown
You might also like
I'm grown now, certified and all that
You say what you want, you can't take a thing from me
I'm grown now (Oh-oh)
I-I-I-I'm grown now (I'm grown now)
I-I-I-I'm grown now, got my own money
You ain't gonna run me, I ain't no dummy
I'm grown now (Oh, yeah-yeah)
I-I-I-I'm grown now (Oh-ooh-ooh)
I-I-I-I'm grown

I can't believe they tryna block me
But you're still playin' them games I thought you'd be
Up in my lead, but no, you can't compete
Back up, don't touch, gotta give me fifty feet
'Cause I'm on another level
I'm bringin' things to life like I'm Gepetto
This is the last time that I'm gonna tell you
I'm doin' it big now, you want a piece? Let it go

You wonder why I'm so cold
You coulda been more involved, but no
I'm not the girl that you knew before
I can't believe you didn't know that I'm grown
I'm grown now, certified and all that
You say what you want, you can't take a thing from me
I'm grown now (Oh-oh)
I-I-I-I'm grown now (I'm grown now)
I-I-I-I'm grown now, got my own money
You ain't gonna run me, I ain't no dummy
I'm grown now (Oh, yeah-yeah)
I-I-I-I'm grown now (Oh-ooh-ooh)
I-I-I-I'm grown

Aye, Tiff
Yo big brother got you
It's nothin'
You push one hand to the cloud, then back to the wind
Bow and Tiff Evans is back at it again
Yeah ma, ya grown, go on and let ya rims spin, yeah
You got ya lil' premiers
These fifty lil' days go head and let ya paint drip
(Drip-drip-drip-drip) Tell your parents don't trip
And with ya girls, go on ya lil' trips
It's your world, lil' mama, it's your life to live, believe that

I'm not those girls you're used to datin'
I got a unique situation (I'll tell you the truth)
You can travel the world, but you'll never find someone
(That does what I do)
I'll have you open, 'cause...
I'm grown now, certified and all that
You say what you want, you can't take a thing from me
I'm grown now (Oh-oh)
I-I-I-I'm grown now (I'm grown now)
I-I-I-I'm grown now, got my own money
You ain't gonna run me, I ain't no dummy
I'm grown now (Oh, yeah-yeah)
I-I-I-I'm grown now (Oh-ooh-ooh)
I-I-I-I'm grown now, certified and all that
You say what you want, you can't take a thing from me
I'm grown now (Oh-oh)
I-I-I-I'm grown now (I'm grown now)
I-I-I-I'm grown now, got my own money
You ain't gonna run me, I ain't no dummy
I'm grown now (Oh, yea-yeah)
I-I-I-I'm grown now (Oh-ooh-ooh)
