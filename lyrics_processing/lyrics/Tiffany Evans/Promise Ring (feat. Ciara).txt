To the beat
To the beat
To the beat
'Cause I need
Everybody to the floor (why)
'Cause this beat is sick (yeah)
It's time to rock (uh)
That's what it is
Tiffany is the name
Love is the game
The only way to play is with this promise ring
(Tiffany:)
Sometimes a girl needs to know that she's appreciated for all the things she does
With some sorta of token of love
Cause without it her young heart won't know (heart won't know)
And right then to my surprise
(He) Pulled out a small velour box pink ribbon tied
I'm wondering what's inside
He opened it and then he replied
(Pre-Chorus:)
He said I promise not to hurt you, promise not to lie
Promise to befriend you and defend you with my life
I promise you forever, I promise you today
(He said) Would you wear my promise ring
(I said yes)
You might also like(Chorus:)
If you break your promise we breaking up
Gotta couple things that I want
Walks in the park and sweet things
If I rock your promise ring
I could be pretty young thing (young thing)
You could become my king (my king)
I gotta have you by me
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise, promise, promise ring
Yes, I'll rock your promise
Yes, I'll rock your promise ring
(Repeat)
(Tiffany:)
How in the world could a girl say no (no)
I knew it the moment he made my finger glow (glow)
It's good to know I'm who he chose (chose)
It was your heart he felt now it shows (now it shows)
You know when ya see me floss
No way it's gonna get loss (loss), I'll never take this off (off)
When I'm older and they call me by your name
I'll wear it on a chain
Because I can hear you say
(Pre-Chorus)
(Chorus)
(Bridge - Ciara:)
Everybody get up rock
Rock to this beat
(Tiffany:)
My name is tiffany
(Ciara:)
And you all know me
(Tiffany:)
All my girls with me, all the boys like me
Come correctly, with a promise ring
And you (and you), just might be my boo, my boo
Pro-mise that you'll ne-ver let me go and boy I'll
Boy I'll wear your promise ring
All you have to do is say the word and boy I'll
Boy I'll wear your promise ring
Just let me know (just let me know, just let me know)
All you gotta do is just let me know (just let me know, just let me know)
You ain't going nowhere
I ain't going nowhere
I'll be on for sure but u gotta know that
