Dut, dut, dum, dum, dum, doom
(Get upstairs, Tiff)
Dut, dut, dum, dum, dum, doom
(And change your clothes, quick)
Dut, dut, dum, dum, dum, doom
(Zip your coat up)
Dut, dut, dum, dum, dum, doom
(You chillin' wit da Clutch)

You're the private school girl
With your skirt rolled up
Showing off what you ain't even got yet (got yet)
You need to button up your blouse
Put back on your vest
'Cuz you're out here lookin' a mess
You must be tryna catch a cold (catch a cold)
Where your mom and pops at?
How dey feel about that?
Girl, you need to stop that, you know (you know)
Tryna fit in the outfit
Tell you what you gon' get whatcha you don't want
[Chorus}
You showin' skin
You showin legs
You gone get hurt what i said
You bumped your head
'Cuz your mama 34 and she still be up in da club
Your daddy, he ain't got no key
Since they broke up and he a thug
She goin' online
She losin her mind
She showin' her behind
And child it's...
Just another girl gone wild  (just another girl gone wild)
Just another girl gone wild (just another girl gone wild)
Just another girl gone wild (just another girl gone wild)
Just another girl gone wild (just another girl gone wild)
Just another girl gone wild (just another girl gone wild)
Just another girl gone wild (just another girl gone wild)

You're the chat room girl wit your webpage up
Impersonatin' grown folks, stop that (stop that)
You better cut that tease
You way outta your league
Before you do something you can't take
Sneakin' out that door, don't nobody know
Ain't nothing out in them streets
Nobody wants you girl, please
Fall back, girl
Slow your roll (your roll) before you out of control
Can't nothin' save you no no
