When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in the crowd
Then someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now its much to late for me to
Take a second look

Oh baby give me one more chance
(Show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(Open your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now that I see you in her arms
(I want you back)
Yes I do now
(I want you back)
Oo, oo baby
(I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want you back)
Naw, naw naw naw
You might also like
Tryin to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you boy
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the boy
I didn't even want around


We used to go to the county fair
To the movies, to the dance
Most anywhere
But then I acted like I didn't care
And now I'm sad as can be not to
Have you there
You come around
We can hit the beach
Head on down to Mickey D's
Or watch some next movies
It's the truth
And a well known fact
That I miss you
I want you back

All I want
(A bu ba bu ba)
All I need
(A bu ba bu ba)
All I want
(A bu ba bu ba)
All I need
(A bu ba bu ba)
All I want
(Oo, just one more chance)
Yeah yeah
(Show you that I love you)
Baby
(Baby)
Baby
(Baby!)
Baby
(BABY!)
Forget what happened love
(And let me live again)
Oh baby I was blind to let you go
(Let you go darlin')
But now that I see YOU in her arms
(I want you back)
Spare me up and roll
(And give me back what I love)
Oh babe can I get one more chance
(I'll tell you that I love you)
Ow!
(Ow!)
Ow! I want you back boy
(I want you back)
WHOO!!!
