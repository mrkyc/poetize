I always thought that we are heaven sent
You say that I don't have no patience
Well, you don't show appreciation
Remember how I made you feel?
You're holding back from me
Now what's the deal?
It's like every day you want it
But I just wanna know what's in your head
I want to go back to what was real
Can't we just go back, baby, just live?
I set it off tonight
I wanna go back to what was real
Can't we just go back, baby, just live?
Can't we get it right?
'Cause we don't ball like we used to
Get it how we used to
Tell me what's the issue
Baby, what do we do?
You can do better
I can do better
Can we do better?
You might also like'Cause we don't ball like we used to
Get it how we used to
Riding round the hood in the coupe like we used to
Baby, what do we do?
Can we do better?
Oh, baby
I don't wanna keep repeating this
But you know is crazy
How we both say the same things
And nothing changes
All this love we got in this world
And we're acting shady
Babe, it just amazes me
I want to go back to what was real
Can't we just go back, baby, just live?
I set it off tonight
I wanna go back to what was real
Can't we just go back, baby, just live?
Can't we get it right?
'Cause we don't ball like we used to
Get it how we used to
Tell me what's the issue
Baby, what do we do?
You can do better
I can do better
Can we do better?
'Cause we don't ball like we used to
Get it how we used to
Riding round the hood in the coupe like we used to
Baby, what do we do?
Can we do better?
