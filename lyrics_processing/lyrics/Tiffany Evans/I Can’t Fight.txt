You say something that always gets under me
We argue then we go our separate ways
You come back like everything's the same
You always know a way to get to me
Whisper in my ear how much you want me
Now how the hell can I stay mad, boy?
Especially when you know just where to touch me
'Cause you know just what I want
I try to be strong
When it comes to you
You always break me down, boy
Give me good love
You take it, 'cause it's yours
When it's all said and done
I come back for more
'Cause you love me like you
Love me like you, love me like you do
Touch me like you
Touch me like you, touch me like you do
I can't fight, no, baby
I can't fight, oh. oh
My body said it, said it, said it
Said it, said it, said it
