When I tripped,you catch me before I hit ground
I declare, every time you come around
I feel my feet leaving the ground
Yeah, yeah

I ain't never known another lover like you,like you
You got me feeling stronger every time when I'm with you
You know it's true
You know what I'm talking about
Heal me from the inside out
You deserve a medal, maybe even better

Cause baby you saved me
And you didn't need a cape
Boy, you rescued me
Baby you changed me
Brought me back to life
So now when you fight
I'm right there beside you
I'm right beside you, right beside you
Anything that you need I'll provide you
Right beside you, right beside you
Your love takes me higher than planes
You give me wings
You might also likeThere's so much that I wish I could do to
Show appreciation for you
Beingthe man that you are
You take me so far
And I don't feel like I deserve it
Everyday you make me feel worth it, oh

I ain't never known another lover like you,like you
You got me feeling stronger every time when I'm with you
You know it's true
You know what I'm talking about
Heal me from the inside out
You deserve a medal, maybe even better

Cause baby you saved me
And you didn't need a cape
Boy, you rescued me
Baby you changed me
Brought me back to life
So now when you fight
I'm right there beside you
I'm right beside you, right beside you
Anything that you need I'll provide you
Right beside you, right beside you
Your love takes me higher than planes
You give me wings
I ain't perfect
You ain't perfect
But together we're invincible
We deserve this love we've earned it
Boy you got me so high

You give me wings
You give me wings
