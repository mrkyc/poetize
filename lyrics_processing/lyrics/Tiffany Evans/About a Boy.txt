Mmmmmm...
Hands Sweating Knees Trembling Am Scared (Am Scared)
Am A Mess Am A Nervous Wreck Am Playing In My Hair
So I Look Thru A Crowd Of Unfamiliar Faces And Your Undetailed An I Swear I Thought You'd Be There (Man I Thought You'd Be There) Am Feeling Some Kind Of Wave Down Deep Inside Cause You Never Gave Me No Reason Why Am Telling You It's Not OK So Before The Record Starts To Play...
Chorus
This Anit Another One Of Them Love Songs Go Back In To The Arms Of Love Song, No No Not This Time I Guaranteed It Will Make You Cry This Ones About A Boyyyyy (I Use To Like).This Ones About A Boyyyyy (I Use To Like) No Happy Endings No No Not This Time I Guaranteed It Will Make You Cry This Ones About A Boy
Verse 2
Heart Broken Am Holding Back Tears (I Got To Get A Way)They Won't Understand Crying Because Your Not Here Alone In A Room Nobody Else Around Me That's How It Feels Untill You Come Thru For Me And You Know How I Still, Still Feel.Am Feeling Some Kind Of Wave Down Deep Inside Cause You Never Gave Me No Reason Why Am Telling You It's Not OK So Before The Record Starts To Play...
Chorus
This Anit Another One Of Them Love Songs Go Back In To The Arms Of Love Song, No No Not This Time I Guaranteed It Will Make You Cry This Ones About A Boyyyyy (I Use To Like).This Ones About A Boyyyyy (I Use To Like) No Happy Endings No No Not This Time I Guaranteed It Will Make You Cry This Ones About A Boy
Verse 3
Just Let It Spin (It Spin) No Hair Blowin In The Wind
