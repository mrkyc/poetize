Dark child
Yes yelling to the lite beat and
It's b-dub and tiffany and
We are in the place to be and
We came in to move your feet and
Get things jumping like there supposed to
Teen magazines were jumping right out the posters
Can't believe what you saying in lip gloss
I know you can't believe she getting older

She's just a teen
So how could she
Really know what she wants
I can't believe
You'd think I'd run and tell you're mean to me
When it's really like
She mean ain't she
I know just what you think
You're so stuck in the past
Like stone-washed jeans
And I can endorse
Anything through me
I'm flyer then you'd ever thought I'd be
You might also like
You wonder why I'm so cold
You coulda been more involved but no
I'm not the girl that you knew before
I can't believe you didn't I'm grown

I'm grown now
Certified and all that
You say want you want
You can't take a thing from me
I'm grown now (oh) I... I... I'm grown now (I'm grown)

Got my own money
You ain't gonna run me
I ain't no dummy
I'm grown now (yea...) I... I... I'm grown now (I'm grown)

I can't believe, they tryna block me
Just to playing them games I thought you'd be
Up in my lead but no you can't compete
Back up don't touch gotta give me 50 feet
Cause I'm a on another level
I'm bringing things to life like I'm japetto
This is the last time that I'm gonna tell you
I'm doing it big now, you wanna piece let it go
You wonder why I'm so cold
You coulda been more involved but no
I'm not the girl that you knew before
I can't believe you didn't I'm grown

I'm grown now
Certified and all that
You say want you want
You can't take a thing from me
I'm grown now (oh) I... I... I'm grown now (I'm grown)
I'm grown now
Got my own money
You ain't gonna run me
I ain't no dummy
I'm grown now (yea...) I... I... I'm grown now (I'm grown)

You push one hand to the cloud then back to the wind
Bow and tiff evans is back at it again
