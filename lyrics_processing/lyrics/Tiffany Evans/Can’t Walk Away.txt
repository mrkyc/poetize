Clean slate we're back together
We're just now, see boy now I know better oh oh oh...
Then we go losing our temper
I'm outro saying forget you
But I can't keep it moving and let you go oh oh oh...
(chorus)
I..I..I can't walk away from you when i say we're through
Don't how you do me the way you do me the way u do
I wish that i never met u
Cuz i can't walk away from you when i say were thru
Don't know how i'm so damn in love wit u
I can't walk away from you
How many times did you say sorry
Just to turn around and say you don't want me
Flip it back, back and spend a night callin oh oh oh...
And I got a big fool think of gettin closer
Everytime we're cool youre tellin me that its over
And youre playin games
Even thou its old i know oh oh oh...
I..I..I can't walk away from you when i say we're through
Don't how you do me the way you do me the way u do
I wish that i never met u
Cus i can't walk away from you when i say were thru
Don't know how i'm so damn in love wit u
I can't walk away from you
You might also likeJust when i'm sayin its time to move on
Just when i'm tellin eveybody im gone
I gotta check myself
Cus the truth I can't be...
Nowhere without you
Its all about you
Can't be wit noone if its not u
Baby wat am i gonna do
I can't walk away from you
I..I..I can't walk away from you when i say we're through
Don't how you do me the way you do me the way u do
I wish that i never met u
Cus i can't walk away from you when i say were thru
Don't know how i'm so damn in love wit u
I can't walk away from you
I..I..I can't walk away from you when i say we're through
Don't how you do me the way you do me the way u do
I wish that i never met u
Cus i can't walk away from you when i say were thru
Don't know how i'm so damn in love wit u
I can't walk away from you
Wake up and make up, wake up and break up then we do it all over again
Wake up and make up, wake up and break up then we do it all over again
