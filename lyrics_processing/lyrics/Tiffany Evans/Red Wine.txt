Makin this dinner
Sippin this red
12 in the morning
And you still ain't here, nah
Look at this picture
Now what's wrong with it?
You don't wanna know
The thoughts in my head
Bsection:
Baby I can't figure out
Why you'd rather be out than home
I'm tired of being alone
(You're becoming way too comfortable)
You know it ain't really that much work in the world
Hook:
Now I'm all up in my feelings
Got me sippin sippin on this red wine
Yeah I'm all up in  my feelings
Cause you never fail to do this every time
You drive me to the Red Wine
Drive me to the Red Wine
Drive me to the, drive me to the Red Wine
Drive me to the Red Wine

Verse 2:
I laid these red petals in your favorite stilettos
Red bottoms that you like
You could've had the ride of your life
Red box up with the red dawn on
Red kisses on just to make my mark
You walking in its 5:00 a.m
Now I'm seeing red
B-section:
Baby I can't figure out
Why you'd rather be out than home
I'm tired of being alone
(You're becoming way too comfortable)
You know it ain't really that much work in the world
Hook:
Now I'm all up in my feelings
Got me sippin', sippin' on this Red Wine
Yeah, I'm all up in my feelings
Cause you never fail to do this every time
You drive me to the Red Wine
Drive me to the Red Wine
Drive me to the, drive me to the Red Wine
Drive me to the Red Wine
(Oh, sippin', sippin', sippin')
Bridge:
Don't say a word cause I've already heard it all before
Food sittin on the stove
Gotta warm it up cause its cold
You wanna lay up
You can forget it
Cause I'm feeling like being petty
I may be trippin' cause I've been sippin on this red wine
Oh my, why you gotta be so fine?
Just like this red wine
Even though I'm mad as hell
I can't keep my hands to myself
