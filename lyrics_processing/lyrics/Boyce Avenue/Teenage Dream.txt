Without any makeup on
I think you're funny
When you tell the punchline wrong
I knew you got me
So you let your walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things
Were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's just talk all through the night
There's no need to rush
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever

You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
When you're around me
Life's like a movie scene
I wasn't happy
Until you became my queen
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's just talk all through the night
There's no need to rush
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever

You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
