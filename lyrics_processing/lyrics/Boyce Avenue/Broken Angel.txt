You showed him all the best of you
But I'm afraid your best
Wasn't good enough
And know he never wanted you
At least not the way
You wanted yourself to be loved
And you feel like you were a mistake
He's not worth all those tears that won't go away

I wish you could see that
Still you try to impress him
But he never will listen

Oh, broken angel
Were you sad when he crushed all your dreams?
Oh, broken angel
Inside you're dying cause you can't believe
Oh, you can't believe

And now you've grown up
With this notion that you were to blame
And you seem so strong sometimes
But I know that you still feel the same
As that little girl who shined like an angel
Even after his lazy heart put you through hell

Oh, broken angel
Were you sad when he crushed all your dreams?
Oh, broken angel
Inside you're dying cause you can't believe
He would leave you alone
And leave you so cold
When you were his daughter
But the blood in your veins
As you carry his name
Turns thinner than water
You're just a broken angel

And I promise that it's not your fault
It was never your fault
And I promise that it's not your fault
It was never your fault

Oh, broken angel

Turns thinner than water
Oh, he would leave you alone
And leave you so cold

As you carry his name
Turns thinner than water
You're just a broken angel

You're just a broken angel
Oh, angel

And I promise that it's not your fault
It was never your fault
And I promise that it's not your fault
It was never your fault
It was never your fault
And I promise that it's not your fault
It was never your fault
