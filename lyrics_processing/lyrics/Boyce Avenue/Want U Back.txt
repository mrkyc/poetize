Ohhh...
Hey, I was done playing games
Knew I needed to upgrade
So I went and walk away, way, way...
Now, you see I've been hanging out
With another girl in town
At least she doesn't bring me down, down, down...

Remember all the things you and I did first
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things you and I did first
You got me, got me like this
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

Boy, you can say anything you want
It don't mean a thing, no one else can have you
I want you back, yeah, I want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be fine
But now I feel sick, looking at you crying
I want us back, yeah, I want us back

Please, rid me off the jealousy

And I'm gonna make you see, see, see...
You clearly didn't think it through
Cause I did everything for you
And now, I don't know what to do, do, do...

Remember all the things you and I did first
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things you and I did first
You got me, got me like this
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

Boy, you can say anything you want
It don't mean a thing, no one else can have you
I want you back, yeah, I want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be fine
But now I feel sick, looking at you crying
I want us back, yeah, I want us back
Ooooh...
I thought that you'd be fine when I kissed you goodbye
Aaoohh...
You might be with her but I know we can work

Boy, you can say anything you want
It don't mean a thing, no one else can have you
I want you back, yeah, I want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be fine
But now I feel sick, looking at you crying
I want us back, yeah, I want us back

Ooooh...
