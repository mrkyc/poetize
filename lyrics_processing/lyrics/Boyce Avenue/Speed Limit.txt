Fake a smile but couldn't find the joy, no
They slow you down just to make sure you fit in, oh
But they were wrong cause I wouldn't change a thing, no
If you want somebody to love you
You know I will
If you want somebody to need you
You know I will
So baby, get up
Come on, get in the fast lane
You are the one
That's got a hold on me
I say we got to live our lives
Yeah with no speed limit
Get up, come on
You make my heart race
You are the one
That keeps the pace I need
I say we got to live our lives
Yeah with no speed limit
With no speed limit
Behind your walls I fell for the girl in pain, oh
So all along your struggles were not in vain, oh
If you want somebody to love you
You know I will
If you want somebody to need you
I always will
So baby, get up
Come on, get in the fast lane
You are the one
That's got a hold on me
I say we got to live our lives
Yeah with no speed limit

You are the one
That keeps the pace I need
