Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might be the one now

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a hell no?
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight alright

Dancing you and me

Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who bout' that life?
And we can't stop

We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
