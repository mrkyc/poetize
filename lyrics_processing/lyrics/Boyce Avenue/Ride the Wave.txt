Sometimes when I feel low, I wish that I could know
The outcome of this life, The path for you and I
But then I realize, the beauty of it lies
Within the mystery of a life choose to lead

We gotta get up, we gotta get up now
The ride is always worth the rush
We can't give, we can't give up now
Our love will always be enough

The tides will rise and fall, some days you will feel small
But ride the wave, I'll ride it in with you
If we should wash ashore, I'll fight for you once more
Just ride the wave, I'll ride it in with you
I'll ride it in with you, I'll ride the wave with you

With our feet in the sand, and my heart in your hands
I cannot comprehend, how one day it all could end
But I guess that's how it goes, nobody ever knows
How long this life will last, so while we have the chance

We gotta get up, we gotta get up now
The ride is always worth the rush
We can't give, we can't give up now
Our love will always be enough
