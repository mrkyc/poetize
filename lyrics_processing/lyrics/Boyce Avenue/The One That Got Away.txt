We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on your 18th birthday we got that chain tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never plan that one day I'd be losing you
In another life you would be my girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In other life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
You were dreaming I was your Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on ohh
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music I'm longer your muse
But in another life you would be my girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one that got away
All these money can't buy me a time machine, no
I can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me whoa
Cause now I pay the price
In another life you would be my girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one the one the one the one
The one that got away
The one the one the one the one
