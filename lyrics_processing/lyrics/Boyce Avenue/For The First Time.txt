She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While i'm drinking jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how, how we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
She needs me now but i can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now in the unemployment line
And we don't know how, how we got into this mess is it a god's test
Someone help us cause we're doing our best
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Sit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting

We're smiling but we're close to tears
