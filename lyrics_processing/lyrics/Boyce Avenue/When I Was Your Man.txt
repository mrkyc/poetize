Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh, too young, too dumb to realize

That you should have bought me flowers
And held my hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take me to every party
Cause all I wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Your pride, your ego, your needs, and your selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like me to walked out your life
(Now you'll never, never get to clean up the mess you made, oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes)

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh, too young, too dumb to realize

That you should have bought me flowers
And held my hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
And take me to every party
Cause all I wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know it's probably much too late
To try and apologize for your mistakes
(So I just want you to know)

I hope he buys me flowers
I hope he holds my hand
Gives me all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things you should have done
When you were my man
Do all the things you should have done
When you were my man
Do all the things that I should have done
