Aren't you something to admire
'Cause your shine is something like a mirror?
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand
And a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space, but now you're home
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror (Oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh-oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh-oh)
With anyone else beside of me (Oh-oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That were making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you something, an original
'Cause it doesn't seem really as simple?
And I can't help but stare 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

Cause with your hand in my hand
And a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space, but now you're home
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along, oh

It's like you're my mirror (Oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh-oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh-oh)
With anyone else beside of me (Oh-oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That were making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh-oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Yesterday is history, oh woah
And tomorrow's a mystery, mystery, hey
I can see you looking back at me
Keep your eyes on me, yeah
Keep your eyes on me
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space, but now you're home
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along, oh

It's like you're my mirror (Oh-oh)
