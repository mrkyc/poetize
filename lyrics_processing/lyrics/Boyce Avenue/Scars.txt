Jade is not alone
But all he can feel is lonely
His bedroom doesn't feel like home, Yeah (yeah, yeah)
The sound posts through the walls
The hate from a man who only
Knows to love by casting stones, yeah (yeah, yeah)

And through it all do we see or feel it
His tears dry but the years reveal it
We stay blind to the sounds we see
When the truth could set them free

Time to fake it over
Beyond the pain and disregard
We got to see through these scars (oh oh oh)
Love will bring use closure
If we can be who we are
We gotta see through these scars (oh oh oh)
Oho ohoh yeah x2

Sarah takes the blame
For a time that is gone forever
Her past is an everlasting maze, yeah (yeah, yeah)
And in this role she plays
Against who is in the mirror
It's a constant struggle everyday, yeah (yeah, yeah)

And through it all do we see or feel it
His tears dry but the years reveal it
We stay blind to the sounds we see
When the truth could set them free

Time to fake it over
Beyond the pain and disregard
We got to see through these scars (oh oh oh)
Love will bring use closure
If we can be who we are
We gotta see through these scars (oh oh oh)
Oho ohoh yeah x2

And through it all do we see or feel it
His tears dry but the years reveal it
Time to fake it over
Beyond the pain and disregard
We got to see through these scars (oh oh oh)
Love will bring use closure
If we can be who we are
We gotta see through these scars (oh oh oh)
Oho ohoh yeah x2
We gotta see through these scars (we gotta see through these scars)
Oho ohoh yeah x2
