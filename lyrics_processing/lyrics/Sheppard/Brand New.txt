Well, I was young and a little bit dumb
And if truth was to be told, wasn't ready for love
But when you came along, well, I knew I was done
'Cause it felt like my heart had been hit by a shotgun
Fast forward now a couple of years and we still have each other
And we know how it feels to be a little bit older
On this roller coaster, you're that somebody with your head on my shoulder

I'll be lovin' you forever, at least until my life has passed me by

'Cause I still can't get enough of you
Oh, I still can't get enough and it feels brand new, brand new
How does it feel? Brand new, brand new
No, I still can't get enough of you
Oh, I still can't get enough and it feels brand new, brand new
How does it feel? Brand new, brand new

You've always given me your hell of a vibe
You're the most beautiful girl and you don't even try
And as far as I know, I'm the luckiest guy
'Cause I won the only prize that money can't buy
Even when gravity was bringing you down
I find a way to get your feet off the ground
My love's gonna hold you and as we get older
In decades to come, there'll be plenty left over
