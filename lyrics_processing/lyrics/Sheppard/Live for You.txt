Are we really breaking up
Wasn't I enough for you, for you
I gave my very best
But I failed every test
You put me through, it's true

If I changed my face
My hair, my dress, my shape
Would you stay, would you stay
Just give me something to improve
'Cause I need you always, always

Now I'm lying in the dust
It's all that's left of us
I'm not as strong as you
And I won't make it through
And you say I will survive
Then you go on with your life
And I wish I was the same
But I can't stop the pain
'Cause boy I live for you

When you closed the door
My body hit the floor
'Cause you were my cage
And now I'm nothing
Well I have much regret but
If I scream and beg
Would you stay, would you stay

Now I'm lying in the dust
It's all that's left of us
I'm not as strong as you
And I won't make it through
And you say I will survive
Then you go on with your life
And I wish I was the same
But I can't stop the pain
'Cause boy I live for you

I will never hide it
I will always fight for love
I have to rectify it
'Cause I will never give you up

And now with every breath I fight my loneliness
Well it stays, stays, stays

I'm lying in the dust
It's all that's left of us
I'm not as strong as you
And I won't make it through
And you say I will survive
Then you go on with your life
And I wish I was the same
But I can't stop this pain
'Cause boy I live for you
Boy I live for you
