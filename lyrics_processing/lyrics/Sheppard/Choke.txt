Everybody's looking at you what you gonna do
You're waiting with your fiddle in the middle of the room
You can be the greatest and nobody gonna know
So quit it up and make it up and hit it with your bow
You've got a little bit of liquor in your cup
So have another sip I think you need to loosen up
But everyone is fiddling and looking at their phones
You're losing all the people and you haven't played a note
You can be somebody can be anyone you want
So take a look around before everybody gone

You think you're losing but you're doing alright
You'd be a lion if you knew you could fight
I'm saying eh-yo, eh-yo, don't choke
This is a moment in the prime of your life
You better own it or you'll kiss it goodbye
I'm saying eh-yo, eh-yo, don't choke
So let go, let go-oh, oh-oh-oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Hey, hey, hey

If you wanna kiss her then you need to make a move
She's feeling kinda empty and she really wanna groove
You had the opportunity but now it's gone across
She was giving every sign and now you're gonna choke
It's been a little while since you even said a word
If you never get to first then you'll never get to third
She's looking at her bottle and she's playing with her straw
And in another minute she'll be moving on the floor
I can see a player who be looking for a chance
So look into her eyes you can put her in a trance

You think you're losing but you're doing alright
You'd be a lion if you knew you could fight
I'm saying eh-yo, eh-yo, don't choke
This is a moment in the prime of your life
You better own it or you'll kiss it goodbye
I'm saying eh-yo, eh-yo, don't choke
So I say let go, let go-oh, oh-oh-oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
