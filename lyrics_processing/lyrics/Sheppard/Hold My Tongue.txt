I'm hoping somebody's gonna hold my tongue
Oh yes I'm hoping somebody's gonna hide my gun
I'm hoping cause I don't wanna die this young
Oh yes I'm hoping I'm gone when the man comes along

I'm hoping somebody's gonna hold my tongue
But I've been taking his trouble for far too long
Don't be afraid we're gonna right his wrongs
And when the shit hits the fan he's gonna start to run

And if you wanna be part of a better restart (Ohh Ohh)
I can see a crack in the back of his weak heart. (Ohh Ohh)
We could turn it upside down with all the lies
And disguises buried underground
Oh, you'll never hold me down

We're all wrapped up in a web of lies
Spun like a mummy but they missed our eyes
They're waiting in the middle of their own demise
But if we're marching together we can break inside

And if you wanna be part of a better restart (Ohh Ohh)
I can see a crack in the back of his weak heart. (Ohh Ohh)
We could turn it upside down with all the lies
And disguises buried underground
Ohh, you'll never hold me down

Even distant stars align
And I've seen the rain erode rock in time
Even baby birds must fly in time

I'm hoping somebody's gonna hold my tongue
But a screaming protester can't be wrong
I know that somebody's gonna get it done
Yes I'm hoping the megaphone man comes along (Two, three,four)

And if you wanna be part of a better restart (Ohh Ohh)
I can see a crack in the back of his weak heart (Ohh Ohh)
We could turn it upside down with all the lies
And disguises buried underground
Ohh, yeah
And if you wanna be part of a better restart
I can see a crack in the back of his weak heart
We could turn it upside down with all the lies
And disguises buried underground
