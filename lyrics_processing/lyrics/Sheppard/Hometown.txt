No one understands
They all think I'm a lucky man
Truth is I'm in a rut
(Oh ya ya hey)
All this love and joy
Even so I'm a lonely boy
Close to giving it up

'Cause baby, life takes me places that I never dreamed I would find
But still there's nowhere that I'd rather be than to be by your side

You are my hometown
Where I can slow down
We got it good, we got it all figured out
You are my hometown
Let there be no town
We understood it's where I should be now

Well love just don't feel right
When I don't have your hand in mine
I'm scared you're slipping away
(Oh ya ya hey)
But once I'm homewood bound
From the moment that I touch down
I realise nothing has changed

Well baby, mixing our chemicals often results in a fire
But it's the heat of your heart keeping me holding onto the wire

You are my hometown
Where I can slow down
We got it good, we got it all figured out
You are my hometown
Let there be no town
We understood it's where I should be now
Ay ya ya ya ya
Ay ya ya ya ya
We understood it's where I should be now

'Cause baby life takes me places that
I never dreamed I would find, oh no no
But still there's nowhere that I'd rather be than to be by your side

You are my hometown
Where I can slow down
We got it good, we got it all figured out
You are my hometown
Let there be no town
We understood it's where I should be now
You are my hometown
Where I can slow down
We got it good, we got it all figured out
You are my hometown
Let there be no town
We understood it's where I should be now
We got it good
