A simple way to ease the pain
And numb my mind
But it set me blind
And I missed the signs
I'd knock them down, head onto ground
Where I could hide
I've gotta find a way to leave it all behind
I've gotta find a way to leave it all behind
I don't feel whole
No self control
This thing inside won't be denied
It has my soul
But the dice has rolled
And my blood runs cold
I see my fate, I gotta change
Before I'm old
'Cause it's one more day that has gone to waste
For two lost nights that the drinks erased
Three white lies that I tell my face
Four more marks than my actions break
I've gotta find a way to leave it all behind
I've gotta find a way to leave it all behind

I've been lost
I've been lost
Yeah, I've been lost
I'm off the rails but I'm running beside the train
Don't wanna care just to get back on again
I'm reaching out but I'm clutching onto sand
All I need is somebody to grab my hand
'Cause I've been lost
I've been lost
I've been lost
Yeah, I've been lost
One more chance could be all it takes
Two steps forward baby no mistakes
Three more months, counting down the days
Four more cities till I see your face
5 AM when the sunlight breaks
Six young minds in a crowded place
Seven sings that are now in place
Eight, nine, ten and I'm home again
Now I've found a way to leave it all behind
Now I've found a way to leave it all behind
Now I've found a way to leave it all behind
Now I've found a way to leave it all behind
I was lost, I was lost
