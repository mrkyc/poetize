Come in closer have you got the time?
The obsession makes me lose my mind
And I'm thinking that there's something wrong with me
You walk toward me from across the room
Now my self-control is falling through
In a minute I'll be begging on my knees

Well I've felt this high
Maybe just a couple of times
And I know it's right
When you pull the sheet over my eyes

This electric feeling that I get
Is taking over me
I can't let go now I'm possessed
It warps reality
And I need to find the answer
And I need to find the answer

La da da, da da da, da da da da da
La da da, da da da, da da da da da
La da da, da da da, da da da da da
La da da, da da da, da da da da da

Let me share another drink with you
'Cause I need another night to prove
That there's nothing wrong with me
Now I know that you can feel it too
Even though you won't admit the truth
And I'm feeling that there's something that you need

So I'll take my time
Open up a bottle of wine
And if you feel inclined
Won't you just give me a sign?

This electric feeling that I get
Is taking over me
I can't let go now I'm possessed
It warps reality
And I need to find the answer
And I need to find the answer

La da da, da da da, da da da da da
La da da, da da da, da da da da da
Could it be, could it be
(Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da)
That you're falling for me?
(Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da)
And honey, you hold the only key
To entering the heart of me
And setting all my demons free
Please

This electric feeling that I get
Is taking over me
I can't let go now I'm possessed
It warps reality
And I need to find the answer
And I need to find the answer

La da da, da da da, da da da da da
La da da, da da da, da da da da da
La da da, da da da, da da da da da
La da da, da da da, da da da da da

And I need to find the answer
