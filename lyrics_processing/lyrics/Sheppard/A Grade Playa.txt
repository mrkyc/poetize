Now that your gone and never coming back
I feel as though my heart will never stay intact
I was just an apple that you chewed till your through the core
You've got a lot of charm and yeah it sucked me in
You made me feel loved when I was wearing thin
You're the only reason why a rose ever grows a thorn

'Cause I was a treasure and you had the key
But now it stays buried with me

'Cause you're an a grade playa, a fighter, a hater
And I know better than to waste it all on you
Through your cheating, scheming, I'm still believing
That I'll find a dude who is better than you

Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, be gone

If there were a number for the biggest sleaze
There wouldn't be any other nominees
I'm guessin' all your lies were a blessing in disguise for me

'Cause I am a diamond, I'm more than a stone
And you're just a boy on a throne

'Cause you're an a grade player, a fighter, a hater
And I know better than to waste it all on you
Through your cheating, scheming I'm still believing
That I'll find a dude who is better than you

Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on, be gone

Well I will find another one
Your a gram within a tonne
Just a raindrop in the flood
And I ain't walking into war
To find the sunlight in the storm
To meet the right me in the swarm

You're just an illusion but I've left the show
I make sure that everyone knows
That you're an a grade player, a fighter, a hater
And I know better than to waste it all on you
Through your cheating, scheming, I'm still believing
That I'll find a dude who was better than you

Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
