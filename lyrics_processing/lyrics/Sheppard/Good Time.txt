I wanna spend my money where the days are sunny and bright
I wanna find some people who don't mind no sleeping
'Cause I'll be up tonight
I wanna live and let love fly with the birds in the sky
And I know that you ain't disagreeing
So come on, I just wanna be free, yeah

So let's not hesitate a moment longer
Open up your heart with me
Let it float and just keep singing

I'm just looking for a good time
Wanna take a never-ending holiday
Margaritas on the coastline
At a beach that feels so far away
But I'm really just a punch line
'Cause I already have an amazing view
Always looking for a good time
But my best time is always with you

I plant flowers in the city 'cause I want it looking pretty somehow
I'm gonna chase that feeling where I'm higher than the ceiling
And my head's up in the clouds
I'm sick of high-rise living and bad vibes bringing me down
Yeah, and I know that you ain't disagreeing
So come on, take a chance to be free, yeah
