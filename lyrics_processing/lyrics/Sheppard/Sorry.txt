Science can't explain, what happens in my brain
It haunts me now and it's hard to get through the night
You gave to me your best, but I caved and gave you less
I never tried and now you're nowhere in sight

And within the mess I found a part
The corner of your broken heart
If I could find the other half
I'd patch it up until it starts
I'm sorry that it got to this
I try but I was just a kid
I never had the guts to give you
All of me just like you did

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I am
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I am

It's killing me to know, that you did not have to go
I lack the courage to face these demons and scars
I miss the sun on your skin, on a lazy Sunday morning
And now to numb the pain I reach for the mini bar

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I am
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I am

I'm afraid to face the truth
Every day a new excuse
So I end up placing the blame on you baby
Now in this lonely I lie
And through my deeds I say goodbye, bye, bye

And my apologies to all
To everybody at the door
'Cause every time you want it more
I threw away that heart of yours

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I am
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I am

Why do I, why do I turn away
Every time from everyone every day
So I apologize, are you okay, are you okay
Why do I, why do I turn away
Every time from everyone every day
So I apologize, are you okay, are you okay
