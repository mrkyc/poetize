I can hear a voice from the other side of the room
It says, "Yeah, I live a lie 'cause I like it more than the truth"
I made my peace, I'm one with the war
But here you are without any warning
I'm out of breath but I got to say say say say say

Darling lately
I've been walking blind in the dark, never see the sun
You could save me
Give a little heat to the heart that was born to run
It was love in a minute, God I admit it
Let's make a break for the door
Be my baby
Keep me crazy
Woah, oh oh, uhh!

Cheap wine, head spins, start to fall
Lights down, heart wins, shake it all
I wave my flag, I'm done with the war
You grab my hand, without any warning
I'm on the edge, you pull me away, way way way way

Darling lately
I've been walking blind in the dark, never see the sun
You could save me
Give a little heat to the heart that was born to run
It was love in a minute, God I admit it
Let's make a break for the door
Be my baby
Keep me crazy
Woah, oh oh, uhh!
(Keep me cra-a-azy)
