And I think it's about that time
Everybody's looking for a spark in their eye
Everybody want a little love in their lives
And I think it's about that time
Everybody's looking for a spark in their eye
And I think I just found mine
I'm gonna sing up to the heavens how I feel today
Lordy please don't take my lovely lady away
Finally the sun is shining all of these rays my way
Said I'm feelin' the sunshine down on my skin
But I can't tell if the warmth is coming from within
Sending the good vibes straight from my heart
Because I know that this woman is a new start
For my blissful past I blame nobody
I'm just happy I found my honey
Finally the sun is shining all of these rays my way
Now we can shine, oh shine, oh shine my way
Cuz for the first time in my life I'm gonna be okay (Gonna be okay)
Cuz although time made me cry
To this heavy load I say goodbye
There's nothing else out here but the blue sky
Oh no, there's nothing else out here

Now I'm all geared up to start sewing a seat
They will kid you, my heart
But it's about to be free
I can tell you right now that I'm holding the key
You know, I'll tell you to die
But you gave me reason to fly, it's true
Finally the sun is shining all of these rays my way
Now we can shine, oh shine, oh shine my way
Cuz for the first time in my life I'm gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)
And although times made me cry
To this heavy load I say goodbye
There's nothing else out here but the blue sky (It's gonna be okay)
