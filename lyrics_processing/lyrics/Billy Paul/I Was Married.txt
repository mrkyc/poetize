I was married
But, it just didn't work out right
I was married
Let me tell you 'bout my life
You know, six years is such a long time
To call somebody "Mine"
Hey, payback, I'm not indiscrete
And every guy or gal that I meet
They ask me the same question
And I tell them everytime

That I was married
People, I guess I'm happy 'cause I'm free
I was married
I don't bother her and she don't bother me
Sometimes I wanna, wanna go back
And pick up where we left off at
But I stop dead in my tracks, because

You have your thoughts too
I did all I could do
And it would only be the same thing
All over again
And I tell them everytime
You might also like
That I was married
But, it just didn't work, it didn't work
It didn't work out right
I was married
Please listen to my life
And people keep asking me
The same old thing
And I tell that I, I , I, I, I
Oh, I can testify, I did it twice

I was married
But it just didn't work, didn't work out right
I was married
Please listen to my life
And people keep asking me
The same old thing and I tell them that
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I did it twice
I was married but it just didn't work
Just didn't work, it just didn't work
I was married
It didn't work, it did not work
It did not work, but I was married
It didn't work, it didn't work
People keep asking me because it didn't work
I was married
It did not work
Some of you been married, a lot of you been married
But I was married
A lot of you can talk about it, I can talk about it
I can testify, testify
It didn't work, it didn't work, it didn't work
I was married
It did not work, it did not work, did not work
But Billy Paul was married
Can testify, testify, to be true, to be true
Billy Paul was married
People keep asking me
It didn't work
Don't ask me
It didn't work
Don't ask me
It did not ask
Don't ask me
Tried to pick up where we left off at
It would only be the same thing all over again
Let me tell you 'bout my life, I'll tell you about my life
I was married
I didn't wanna call somebody "Mine", call somebody "Mine"
I guess I was married
Because I'm free, free
I don't bother her, she don't bother me
