Times are changing
All over the world
Times are changing
We got to stay together

I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
It's alright with me
You make me feel so brand new
I want, want to spend my life with you
People, please, let me say since
Since we've been together (Together)
Loving you forever
Is alright with me (Alright with me, alright with me)
Let me, let me be the one you come runnin' to
I'll never, never, never be, ah, untrue

Kings and queens, let's, let's stay together
(Together, together)
Loving you whether, loving you whether
Times are good, bad, happy, sad
You're good, you're bad
You're happy, you're sad
You're good and you're bad
You're happy, you're sad
Whether time are good or bad
Happy or sad

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Do people break up?
They shake a hands or some are kissed
They smile and then they turn around and make up
I just can't see, don't argue with me
Don't argue in the first place
I'll never, never let you, let you do that
Do that to me

Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's
Let's stay together (Together, together)
Don't argue in the first place
Times are changing, loving you forever
Loving you whether
Times are good, times are bad
You're good, you're bad
You're happy, you're sad
You're good and you're bad
You're happy, you're sad

Kings and queens, we've been divided too long
(Let's stay together)
Let's communicate and show our good vibrations
And stay together (Together, together)
Loving you whether, loving you whether
Times are good, times are bad
Times are happy, times are sad
You're good, bad
I'm happy and I'm sad sometimes
But I've got to keep my head together
(Let's stay together)
