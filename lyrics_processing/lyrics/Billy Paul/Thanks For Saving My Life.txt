For picking me up, dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again
(Like I'm living again)
I'm so glad I ran into you
If I hadn't seen you
I would have been through
I was low as low could go
Could not stand anymore
Oh, I could never, never
Never, never repay you
I'm so grateful for all the things
You've done for me
Especially listening to my problems
Then saving me from misery
I just wanna say, thank you, baby, for saving my life
For picking me up, dusting me off
Making me feel like I'm living again
(Like I'm living again)
I'm so glad you came along
You stopped me from singing
That sad, sad song
You might also likeYou're the one who erased the pain
My life would never be the same
You're the very one, that only one
That I've been waiting for
I wanna thank you
For listening to all of my problems
And being my shelter
In and out of the storm
I just wanna say, thank you, baby, for saving my life
For picking me up, dusting me off
Putting me all back together, together, together
(Together, together, together)
I can live
(I can live)
Since I found you, baby
(I can live, I can live)
Now I can live
(I can live)
Since I got you back, baby
I just wanna say
Thank you, baby, for saving my life
(For saving this man)
For picking me up, dusting me off
(Don't you understand, what you're doing to me)
Thank you for saving my life
(We both hooked up, we played together)
For picking me up, dusting me off
(I can't live, I can't live without you, babe)
Didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, didn't you save me
Thank you for saving my life
