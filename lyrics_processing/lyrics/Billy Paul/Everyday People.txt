Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own belief is in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
It makes no difference what group I'm in

There is a blue one who don't accept the green one
Who's living with a fat one trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on
And we got to live together, baby
And we got to live together
And we got to live together, baby
And we got to live together, baby

I am no better and neither are you
Makes no difference whatever we do
You love me, you know me, you hate me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

Who don't like the short hair
Who's trying to be a rich one
That will not help the poor one
Different strokes for different folks
So on and so on
