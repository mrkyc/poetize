Oh, baby, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's bring another life into this world
A little boy, a little girl
Take my hand while we walk slowly to the room
Can't you see tonight I'm gonna make sweet, sweet love to you?
Girl, don't be shy, don't be shy
This is a moment we've been waiting for
Hey, come by my side, by my side
It's the place you'll be forever more, forever more
So, baby, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's make a baby
Oh, baby, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's bring another life into this world
A little boy, a little girl
I want my baby to have shiny eyes like you
I hope and pray that he smiles the same way you do
Hey, don't be shy, don't be shy
Let's be fruitful and multiply
Come by my side, by my side
It's the place you'll be forever more, forever more
You might also likeI said, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's have this baby
Oh, baby, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's bring another life into this world
A little boy, a little girl
Let's put wisdom in his head
So he'll never look back, he'll look straight ahead
We'll teach him the truth and understand the meaning of it all
So he can walk around with his head held tall
Come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's have this baby
(Come on, make a baby, come on, make a baby)
Baby come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's bring another life into this world
A little boy, a little girl
Come on, come on, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's have this baby
(Come on, make a baby, come on, make a baby)
A boy, a girl, ooh

(Come on, make a baby, come on, make a baby)
Don't be shy, don't be shy
Let's make a baby
(Come on, make a baby, come on, make a baby)
Come on by my side, by my side
We'll make a baby
(Come on, make a baby, come on, make a baby)
Think it over, think it over
(Come on, come on)
But we got to make a baby
(Come on, make a baby, come on, make a baby)
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
Let's have a baby
