It's a little bit funny, Lord, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big mansion where we both could live

If, if, if I was a sculptor, Lord, honey, but then again, no (Then again no, no)
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show
I know it's not much, I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
You gave me a gift, Lord, and I'm gon' sing it for you

And you can tell everybody that this is your song (This is your song)
It may be a quite, quite simple, but that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind what I wrote down in words, words
How wonderful life is when you're in the world, world, world

If, if (If), if I was on a rooftop, I'd kick off my shoes (Kick off my shoes, kick my shoes off)
I'll write a few verses and then I'd get the blues
But the sun's been quite, quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you and people like me I wanna, I wanna keep turnin' on

So excuse me for forgetting, but these things I do, Lord (These things I do Lord)
You see, you see I've forgotten if they're green or blue
Anyway, the thing is, anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
You've are the sweetest eyes, you've got the sweetest eyes, the clearest eyes I've ever seen
You might also like
I hope you go back, I hope you, I hope you got back and tell everybody that this is your song (This is your song)
It may be quite, quite simple, but now that's how it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind, but I wrote down in words, Lord, words
I'm doin' it for how wonderful it is when you're in the world, world, world

If, if (If), if I sat upon a rooftop, I'd kick off my shoes, oh, yeah (Kick off my shoes, kick my shoes off)
I'll write a few verses and then I'd get the blues
But the sun's been quite, quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you, people like me, I wanna, wanna keep turnin' on

So excuse me, so excuse me, so excuse me for forgetting, but these things I do (These things I do, Lord)
You see, you see I've forgotten if they're green or blue, baby
And anyway, the thing is, anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
You are the sweetest eyes, the sweetest eyes, the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

I want you to go back, go back and and tell everybody that Billy Paul's got a song (Billy Paul's got a song)
I'm, I'm gonna sit upon a, a rooftop and kick my shoes off
I'm gonna write it (Write it), write it (Write it), write it (Write it)
I might come out with the gospel (Gospel), the blues (Blues), the jazz (Jazz), the rock and roll

I'm gonna, got to, got to write me a simple song for everybody because this is my song (This is my song)
It may be quite, quite simple, but that's the way it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind what I wrote down in words, words
You come back, you try to try again, try again
Tell everybody that Billy Paul's got a song (Billy Paul's got a song)
It may be quite, quite simple, but that's how it's done, baby
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind what I wrote down in words
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, ooh
