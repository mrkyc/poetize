Too bad for him
So good for me
Too bad for him
So good for me

Because one man's junk
Is another man's treasure
One man's pain
Is another man's treasure
One man's pain
Is another man's treasure

He'll let you go
But he didn't know
I'll be there, with my loving arms
He'd put you down
Turn your live around
Ill promise that ill take care of you

Too bad for him
So good for me
He made you bitter
I think you're candy sweet
You might also like
Because one man's junk
Is another man's treasure
One man's hell
Is another man's heaven

He hurt you bad
He made you cry
I'll bring back sunshine in your eyes
Just trust in me
With heart and soul
We'll be together till we grey and old

Too bad for him
So good for me
He made you bitter
Ill make you candy sweet

Because one man's garbage
Is another man's feast
One man's war
Is another man's peace
(So glad I got you)
(So glad you're mine)
(So glad I got you)

Too bad for him
So good for me
Too bad for him
So good for me

Because one man's junk
Is another man's treasure
One man's pain
Is another man's pleasure
One man's garbage
Is another man's feast
One man's war
Is another man's peace

Too bad for him
Goody goody goody goody for me (too bad for him)
Too bad for him
Goody goody goody goody for me (too bad for him)
One man's pain
Another man's pleasure
One man's junk
Is another man's treasure
Too bad for him
Goody goody goody goody for me (too bad for him)
Too bad for him
Goody goody goody goody for me (too bad for him)
I'll spring like sunshine
