Peace, holy peace (Peace, holy peace)
Oh, what a day that's gonna be (Oh, what a day)
When the Evil One is so asleep
Oh peace, oh holy peace

I hate to remind you
But, sisters and brothers
We're living in trying, trying times
Every, everybody is talking
And everybody's planning their futures
But they should be thinking about, ooh, right now
We should be trying to clean out our hearts
Straighten out our minds
Look after some brother so he can shine, shine (Peace, shine, peace )

Peace, holy peace (Peace, holy peace)
Oh, what a day that's gonna, gonna, gonna be (What a day)
When the Evil One got his eyes shut
And he's gonna be so fast asleep
That's the day we are always, always, always be free

There is some people in this world
Just ain't gonna be right
But you just gotta leave them alone
Leave them, leave them alone
One day
We will be able to live together
All for one, one, one for all
And not one spot of debt will you be able
Will you be able, will you be able to find
'Cause everybody's gonna have their stuff together (Shine)
And gonna have some peace, and gonna shine, shine (Peace)
(Shine, shine a light)
You might also like
Peace, holy peace (Peace, holy peace)
(What a day)
When the Evil One, when the Evil One, when the Evil One
When the Evil One is gon' be so fast asleep
Everybody's talking, everybody's planning their future
Lord, sisters and brothers, we shouldn't be thinking 'bout that now
We, we, we are living in trying times, oh, trying times

Peace (Peace)
It don't talk much to find a little peace
(Peace)
There's some people in the world (Holy peace)
You gotta leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone
Leave 'em alone
Peace (Peace)
Holy peace (Holy peace)
Peace (Peace)
(Holy peace)
Peace (Peace, holy peace)
Peace (Peace)
Holy peace (Holy peace)
Peace, peace
Holy peace (Holy peace)
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
(Peace)
Holy peace (Holy peace)
Holy, holy, holy, holy peace
(Peace)
