Too late, too late, too late, baby too late
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing, or maybe we've just stopped trying
And it's too late, baby,it's too late
Though we really, really, really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Oh no, no, no, no, no
It used to be easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and you knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel just like a fool
And it's too late, baby, it's too late
Though we really, really, really did try to make it, try to makeit
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Too late, too late
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, can't you see it too
Still I'm glad for what we had, for how I once loved you
And it's too late,baby, it's too late
Though we really, really, really did try to make it, try to makeit
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Too late, baby Too late, Too late, too late baby
Too late, too late, Ah too late, ah too late
Ah too late, ah too late Ah too late, ah too late
Ah too late, ah too late Ah too late, ah too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, baby Too late, no no no no
I just can't take you back I just can't take you back
One of us has changed You I feel unhappy, baby
Ah but we just Ah but we just
Ah but we just Ah but we just can't stay together
Can't you see that too
But still I'm But still I'm, I'm, I'm I'm still in love with you
