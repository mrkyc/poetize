The time has come for bad things to end
The time has come, for life to begin
The time has come for the war of the gods
Lucifer, oh Lucifer
God of evil, you're the god of hate
We see you every day
Father of the lie
You made man die
Where the light shines
You run and hide
The darkness is where you find your delight
Master of tricks, the master of pain
I said;
"You're the one, you're the one who has no shame"
Lucifer, Satan, the Devil's your name
Do you have the time to get your army ready
You know love conquers all
Will you stand, will you stand
Or will you fall
The time has come, for bad things to end
The time has come, for life to begin
The time has come, for the war of the gods

God is just a title
It's like calling somebody
Father, preacher, president, or general
Allah, Buddha, Hare Krishna
Jehovah, just to mention a few
Some people even call- call Jesus god too
Love, peace, and eternal light is your reward
To anyone who knocks on your doors
There's only one God it's true
You know the names are not the same
One day the people of the world
Will know your real name
You are The Strong and you are The Mighty
I hope I'm with you when they start the fighting
The war of the gods
Love, peace, and eternal life
That's what I want (That's what I want, that's what I want, that's what I want)
Love, peace, and eternal life
Is what I want (That's what I want, that's what I want, that's what I want)
God!
God!
You are The Strong and you are The Mighty
I hope I am with you when they start the fighting
Lord!
Lucifer, Satan, the Devil's your name
Have you had time
To get your army ready?
To get your army ready?
Lucifer, god of evil, hate!
We see you everyday
The father of the lie
The light shines, you run and hide
The darkness is where- is where- is where
Is where- is where
Gotta talk about you because that's where you find your delight
God!
Hard morning 
God!
You make me feel so good, good morning
God!
We gonna talk about Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer
God!
Kicked you out of heaven 'cause you didn't pay your rent
God!
Kicked you out of heaven 'cause you didn't pay your rent
God!
Kicked you out of heaven 'cause you didn't pay your rent
And He is The Strong and He is The Mighty
