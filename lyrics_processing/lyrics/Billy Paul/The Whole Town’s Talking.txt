I got the news today, I heard it through the grapevine
Everybody says that I'm yours and you're mine

And now the whole town's talking
The whole town is talking
Talking 'bout you and me
You and me
I knew somebody saw us

I thought nobody knew, I thought we had a secret
Now every place I go, people stopped there and whispered

And now the whole town's talking
The whole town is talking
Talking 'bout you and me
You and me
I knew, I told you somebody saw us

I don't care what they say
A love for you, my love for you is so strong
Why don't they just mind their business
A love so true could never, never, never
End in, end in, end in pain
