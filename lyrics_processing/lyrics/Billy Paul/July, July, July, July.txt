Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
I never thought the day would come
When I would be so sure
Of who I am and exactly where I'm going
I never thought the day would come
When I'd be knowing truth like I'm knowing
Lucky, lucky me
I'm as happy as I can be
But I was able to find that right road
That makes me be on time
'Cause I feel like 
I was just born, just born, just born again
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Deep down inside I guess I knew
That all I needed was someone
To come along to show me the way
I can't explain how much I got
Out of all the things I hear you say
Lucky, lucky me 
I'm as happy as I can be
But I was able to find that right road
That makes me be on time
'Cause I feel like 
I was just born, just born, born again
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
January, February, March, April, May, June, then comes July
That's when it all started, when it all started in July
I was born, I was born, I was born, I was born, born again in July
I found love was happenin', I found love was happenin' in July
Our love sticks under the weather, our love stick under the weather in
July
I was able to pick the right road, I was able to pick the right road in
July
I knew exactly where I was goin', I knew exactly where I was goin' in
July
Summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime, then July
It's going ???dead beat, it's going dead??? than July
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
July, July, July, July
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
July, July, July, July
