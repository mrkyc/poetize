I'm coming back home for the winter
And the border patrol said I should stick there for a while
It's got my mind in a flood and the light gets dimmer
As the world get cold
So now I'm back in my room, but it looks different
My sister's painted the walls, and nothing's in it anymore
But this is the place I found my spirit
So I know I'm home

'Cause I came to this world as the child of the dreamgiver
Trying to work it all out on the way to the moon
And time wants me around, give my word to the gravediggers
I'm just passing through

Sometimes I wish that I lived in the middle of nowhere
With a couple of dogs and a ranch on a farm
And I don't even like farming or early mornings
It just sounds calm
And I'd marry that girl I met in Texas
Then my Grandma could hang 'round for the wedding
And now it's starting to sound like a better ending
And that hits hard
You might also like
'Cause I came to this world as the child of the dreamgiver
Trying to work it all out on the way to the moon
And time wants me around, give my word to the gravediggers
I'm just passing through

I'm just passing through
I'm just passing through

There's a million tangents I've been twisting
They always lead to regret this reminiscence in the end
Some days my mind feels like a prison
It just needs some sun
So I walk 'til the city meets the country
'Til I'm the only one left in the world
And then I'll write a few songs that just go nowhere
Like this one

'Cause I came to this world as the child of the dreamgiver
Trying to work it all out on the way to the moon
And time wants me around, give my word to the gravediggers
I'm just passing through
I'm just passing through
I'm just passing through
