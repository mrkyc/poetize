All of the sinners, all of the saints
Some of the beauty, all of the pain
In the loss, in the gain
I'm not afraid
All of the sinners, all of the saints
Some of the beauty, all of the pain
In the loss, in the gain
I'm not afraid
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

In these moments drowned in comfort
Have I come blind to what I was?
As forgotten souls are lost in an empire
I would have died to give you hope
(I've been thinking, thinking about you
And I know, I know I might have to)
In the end these church bells won't ring out my love
(I've been thinking, thinking about you
And I know, I know, I know I might have to)

I'm not afraid
In steps of faith
I'll never break
I won't be changed
I'm not afraid
You might also like
The people are silent, the streets are quiet
I've been looking back on the chance I had
To speak and start a riot, oh Lord
The orphans, the hurting, the mourning, the burdened
For every son and daughter, oh Lord
I've lived a lie if it's not for love
(I've been thinking, thinking about you
And I know, I know I might have to)
These four walls won't resound my heart
(I've been thinking, thinking about you
And I know, I know I might have to)

I'm not afraid
In steps of faith
I'll never break
I won't be changed
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
In steps of faith
I'll never break
I won't be changed
I'm not afraid

I see the lights and the stars align
The world is lost, girl now's the time
I've got a fire running through the night
It's burning bright, girl now's the time
I see the lights and the stars align
The world is lost, girl now's the time
I've got a fire running through the night
It's burning bright, girl now's the time
All of the sinners, all of the saints
Some of the beauty, all of the pain
In the loss, in the gain
I'm not afraid
All of the sinners, all of the saints
Some of the beauty, all of the pain
In the loss, in the gain
I'm not afraid
All of the sinners, all of the saints
Some of the beauty, all of the pain
In the loss, in the gain
I'm not afraid
All of the sinners, all of the saints
Some of the beauty, all of the pain
In the loss, in the gain
I'm not afraid
All of the sinners, all of the saints
Some of the beauty, all of the pain
In the loss, in the gain
