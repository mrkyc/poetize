Where the lights turn low
And there's no misleading our true felling show
Let me know
And we'll take it slow
Cuz baby if it gets to cold
We'll set our hearts a glow
We wake up when it feels right
We stay up till we see light
We shout out 'OH, Let's go'
Until our ears ring but
We won't stop till everybody's singing
We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
You said it yourself
Yeah we need this
We all fall down
But get up for the weekend
Just like we planned
These are the sounds we know
And the songs that go
And go on repeating through our stereo
So let me know
Don't turn it low
And baby if you lose control
I won't leave you alone
