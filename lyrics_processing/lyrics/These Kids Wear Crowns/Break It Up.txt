With two training wheels tightly
Holding yourself as you break into the day
Now you're grown up, and you're far away
Far from reflections of youth
Of when you weren't dazed (It's a shame)
So what about your princess?
(So what about your princess?)
Somebodys gonna save your day
So what about your princess
Crying on the front steps
Nobodys gonna come and save your day
Say way your way (way your way)
Save your day
Say way your way (way your way)
Save your day
(CHORUS x2)
Break
Break
Break
Break it up
Shake
Shake
Shake
Shake it up
We know
We know you all too well
You might also likeWe know you all too well
I'd like to see you sailing high like a kite
With no strings holding you tightly
As you float above where you would never stray
But now you're gone and you're far away
Far from every birds eyes view
Of when you were caged (it's a shame)
So what about your princess?
(So what about your princess?)
Somebodys gonna save your day (WOAH)
So what about your princess
Crying on the front steps
Nobodys gonna come and save your day
Say way your way (way your way)
Save your day
Say way your way (way your way)
Save your day
(CHORUS x2)
Things would always look better
Once I finally get her view down from the top
I get a view down from the top
(WOAH OH OH)
(CHORUS)
On and on
Around it goes and back again
I'm learning when to know to throw the towel in
On and on
Around it goes and back again
I'm learning when, so I'm all in
HEY! HEY! HEY!
(CHORUS x3)
Things already look better
Things already look better, better (YEAH)
We know you all too well
(CHORUS)
