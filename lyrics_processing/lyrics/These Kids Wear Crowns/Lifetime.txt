We all have to grow old
And walk the winding road
The fires we burn go cold
Today she stumbles on her way
To find the words to say
Get back to yesterday
Give it all that you got
Cause you got
To feel your heart pound
And you got got got
To put your foot down
Lets figure it out now
We're living a lifetime in a minute. It'll pass right by if you let it
So make it tonight, make it tonight. Cause this is our lifetime
And we just wanna live it
A life time in a minute
If you blink your eyes
You could miss it
So make it tonight
Make it tonight
Cause this is our lifetime
(and we just wanna live it)
She waves
She never makes mistakes
But she,ll never get away
You can't always play it safe
Give it all that you got
Cause you got
To feel your heart pound
And you got got got
To put your foot down
Lets figure it out now
We're living a lifetime in a minute. It'll pass right by if you let it
So make it tonight, make it tonight. Cause this is our lifetime
And we just wanna live it
A life time in a minute
If you blink your eyes
You could miss it
So make it tonight
Make it tonight
Cause this is our lifetime
So get up get up get up x3
Cause this is our lifetime
Just when we thought
It would last last forever
We're counting down the seconds
It's now or it's never
These moments disappear
I know we all have to grow old
We're living a lifetime in a minute. It'll pass right by if you let it
So make it tonight, make it tonight. Cause this is our lifetime
And we just wanna live it
A life time in a minute
If you blink your eyes
You could miss it
So make it tonight
Make it tonight
Cause this is our lifetime
So get up get up get up x3
Cause this is our lifetime (and
We just wanna live it)
So get up get up get up x3
Cause this is our lifetime
