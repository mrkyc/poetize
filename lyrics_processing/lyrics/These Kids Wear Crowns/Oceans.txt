To get low, to reload, and go, oh!
Again and again
I get on my high horse just long enough
To get low, to reload, and go, oh!
Again and again
I met you in a new york minute
The second I get it I'll be committed, I said
'Cause I, have been there before
'Cause I, have been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this
(Take all the time you need, don't forget about me)
I've been waiting for this
(Going through the motions, swimming through these oceans)
I get on my high horse just long enough
To get low, to reload, and go, oh!
Again and again
I get on my high horse, baby
Your name escapes me
I met you in a new york minute
The second I got in I'll be committed, I said
'Cause I, have been there before
'Cause I, have been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this

(Going through the motions, swimming through these oceans)
You said don't wait up
The night is cold but I stayed awake all night
And this is how to twist her words to cliches
And how to lose a girl in ten days
She said don't wait up
The night is cold but I stayed awake all night
And this is how to twist her words to cliches
And how to lose a girl in ten days
I've been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this
I've been waiting for this

I've been waiting for this

Take all the time you need
Don't forget about me
Going through the motions
