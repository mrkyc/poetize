That you, youve been thinking about me
You got me counting down the days
And it's taking forever, and ever
But I am still singing myself to sleep
So don't forget about me when I'm gone
The way we spent those nights singing along
And I'll be waiting for you
(I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for)
So don't forget about me when I'm gone
The way we spent those nights singing along
And I'll be waiting for you
We, weve been waiting for a while
And I'm contemplating
If the words that I said should remain in my head
You got me counting down the days
And it's taking forever, and ever
But I am still singing myself to sleep
So don't forget about me when I'm gone
The way we spent those nights singing along
And I'll be waiting for you
(I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for)
