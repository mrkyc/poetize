I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to run

I'm feeling fed up with this stress, it doesn't suit me
It's 'cause you're heavy with your breath and I'm a true fiend
You keep on coming, keep on coming til I don't know
Who I turn to
You give me nothing, give me nothing that I don't need
Cause you make me

And I have every right to run
Have every to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to
I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to run

I'm feeling less and less impressed, I need a new scene
It's 'cause the story isn't ready for an ending
You keep on coming, keep on coming til I don't know
Who I turn to
You give me nothing, give me nothing that I don't need
Cause you make me
You might also like
And I have every right to run
Have every to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to
I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to run

I could never show it
I could never let you know

And I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to
I have every right to run
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun
Have every right to

I have every right to run (I could never show it)
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun (I could never let you know)
Have every right to
I have every right to run (I could never show it)
Have every right to wake up
And take off into the sun (I could never let you know)
