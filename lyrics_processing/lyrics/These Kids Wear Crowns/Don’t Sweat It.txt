You think I'm bad news well I'm thinking that too
Me, I got a place we can go to
So grab your coat soon and that drink in front of you
We're breathing in, we're breathing out
I'll let you know what I'm all about
It's time we went and let it out
Tonight I'm here 'til I'm gone
Forget your name but it's on the tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all
We got time, the night is still young
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all
You'll be sad to know that it's not far
You're into long drives and I'm into fast cars
Even if we crash it won't leave scars
You know we're, all stars and we know the night is ours
We're breathing in, we're breathing out
I'll let you know what I'm all about
It's time we went and let it out
Tonight I'm here 'til I'm gone
Forget your name but it's on the tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all
We got time, the night is still young
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it
She says her name with accents and oh!
I got a bunch of ex's that she knows!
She's into me, 'cause I cause trouble easy
These girls need drama just to breathe, oh yeah
These girls need drama just to bre-breathe
These girls need drama
Tonight I'm here 'til I'm gone
Forget your name but it's on the tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all
We got time, the night is still young
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all
Tonight I'm here 'til I'm gone
Forget your name but it's on the tip of my tongue
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it at all
We got time
