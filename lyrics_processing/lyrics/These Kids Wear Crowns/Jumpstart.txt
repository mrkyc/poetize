Ain't got no money
Dont know where to go
Just sittin' staring at the stereo
I think we better turn it UP,turn it UP ,turn it UP
Loud
Cause lately i've been feeling kind of low
Let's blow the speakers on the radio;
Cause tonight we're gonna'
Break it DOWN,break it DOWN break it DOWN
We gotta' get up off of the ground !
(Chorus)
We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART
4,3,2,1 GO.!
What's up, when we get it going
No way we're gonna stop
And all you need is a SPARK,SPARK
If it's all that you got!
GOT,GOT,GOT,GOT
-We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART
4,3,2,1 GO
What's up ? We're gonna dance until our L-L-LEGS
Go into shock !
Like an adrenaline SHOT, SHOT going straight to the HEART HEART
Heart,heart,heart,heart
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT A JUMP !
Whoa,Oh,Eh,Oh (x5)
HEY !
We're gonna give it a jump.!

We got enough that we can fill the tank
And even if we gotta' break the bank;
You know we're gonna TURN IT UP,TURN IT UP, TURN IT UP
Time
Ain't got to worry bout' it anymore
And if they try to stop us at the door
You know we're gonna;BREAK IT DOWN,BREAK IT DOWN,BREAK IT DOWN
We gotta' get up off of the ground !
(Chorus)
We're gonna give it a JUMPSTART
4,3,2,1 GO.!
What's up, when we get it going
No way we're gonna stop
And all you need is a SPARK,SPARK
If it's all that you got!

When your heart stops baby
