I'd always dreamed I'd build the cradle we'd lay You in
When we brought You home, when we brought You home
But there You lay, fast asleep in a feed trough
It was all that I could find

I'd always hoped You'd have my eyes
And maybe a bit of the skill of my hands
But as I look into Your eyes I see
Your hands created mine

This is all I have to give
You can share my home and bear my name
But this is not how you should live
But the Son of God has become the Son of man
And this is all I have to give

I'd always thought about how I'd teach you to build your first chair
And how to treat your mom, your lovely mom
How to explain the reckless love of God to your simple mind
But what can I offer you, my Son
When You're the living breathing proof
Of everything I hoped could possibly be true
You might also like
This is all I have to give
You can share my home and bear my name
But this is not how you should live
The Son of God has become the Son of man
And this is all I have to give

Why couldn't God have chosen another man?
How can I lead this family when I don't understand?
And how can I take the place of your Dad
When I cannot explain even how You came to be?
My sweet Jesus, my baby boy

And this is all I have to give
You can share my home and bear my name
But this is not how you should live
But the Son of God has become the Son of man
The glory of God taking the form of man
May the grace of God shine upon this man
'Cause this is all I have to give
