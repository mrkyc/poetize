I'da been pulled out the armor, word to my momma
I'ma hit y'all niggas with somethin' that you ain't never felt
(What?)
Hit y'all niggas for frontin' you caught up in that hell
(What?)
If I thought that half the shit that bitches said was true
I'd be spitting lead at you, to dead your crew
But if you know a bitch? You don't listen to that bitch
You don't argue with that bitch, all you do is fuck that bitch
If I listened to all the snake niggas that's runnin' they mouth
I wouldn't be in the crib, I'd be loadin' up, to run in your house
But you can't fuck with cowards, cause a coward'll be a coward
He'll end up killin' these cowards, and I'm not feelin' these cowards
If I let the niggas around my way tell me how to feel about me
I guess I really, wouldn't be D
But I'm the best that ever did it, the best at it because I live it
How many niggas eat it and shit it, you cats want it? Come and get it
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I wanna see it when it's comin', so I can open faces
Open cases got me payin' to stay out of jail
(What?)
While these streets, got me to prayin' to stay out of hell
(C'mon)
Slipped and I fell, got back up slipped again
But no matter what it's been, niggas never got a win
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good with it
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it
Knew what I was doin', everyday that I've been doin' it
(Okay)
Seein' niggas havin' a good time, so I'ma ruin it
(Yeah)
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggas is puss
Frontin' like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush
When push comes to shove
Whatever love we had take it witchu
Now peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you
Everybody knows you can talk all day
(Yes)
But when it's on what you gonna do walk away
(Yes)
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Man, I told you I lock jaws, carry a Glock four
Close my eyes on y'all niggas, the bullets'll watch yours
Then I gotta open up another can of ass whippin'
Y'all niggas better pucker up, time for some real ass kissin'
I'm a simple man, I lead a simple life, I mean simple like
I don't need much to be aight, live off the land, eat at night
Handle whatever's comin' when I get there, but I'm good
(What?)
Dismantle whatever's comin'
Y'all niggas sit there and put up hoods
How my niggas feelin?
(Good)
How my niggas like it?
(Rough)
What my niggas want?
(Blood)
We stay callin' niggas bluff
But if it's got to be, then it's gon' be
C'mon let's eat
Whatever my niggas want from me
Is what my niggas gonna get from me
And if I ever let the words, of another nigga bother me
I might as well let the sperm, of that other nigga father me
But they know, like I know, the black Rhino
Niggas rippin' through 'em and let the nine blow
Nigga die slow
(Oh, oh, oh)
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Tell me how you feelin' now
I know you illin' now
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
