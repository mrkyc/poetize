What y'all niggas want uh?
Uh, uh, uh
Rubia uh? Papi screamin' out of they mouth
Bombshell, just a second mami, wanna speak out
What I need in my life, make ya body freak out
Baby seem like the type, married niggas sneak out
Like I'm ballin' y'all, yes I be appallin' y'all
Boss type hold it down, wantin' all of y'all
Callin' y'all never chasin' me down
Three weeks, heartbroken, yes you hatin' me now
She speaks, soft spoken, till she datin' the clown
I'm takin' 'em down, reel 'em in and makin' 'em drown
Mistake, I said gimme, bet I'm takin' it now
What I need from a nigga negative in his sound
Audacity, even, askin' me for ass
I laugh, this bitch is fast and free
Swattin' 'em off, when I see this nigga's a flea
Plottin' of course for riches, millionaire wannabe
Uh, uh

Eve you know my name, probably the dangerous type
Brick house stallion, think you tamin' me right?
Not this baby Del-Philly streets they raisin' her right
Keep it pretty or can make it gritty be a lady
Need boots pocket books and a baby 380
But prefer to keep it, calm and cool
When I'm heated I suggest you move
Just avoid a bad situation, what you got to prove?
Leave her be, chicken squakin' hatin' frequently
Mad they man is obsessed and stalkin' me
If he, icy enough, I'm pricin' his stuff
Be nice enough to let him spin, I'm callin' ya bluff
Puttin' it down, Ruff Ryders put in they work
Snatched up the illest viscous pit bull in a skirt
(Gr)
Makin' 'em hurt, haters steady dishin' up dirt
Changin' the game, settin' the rules, makin' it work, uh

Leavin' 'em scared, mami takin' all of this here
All of this fame I'm hungry hope you cats is prepared
Niggas, set me up and I'ma take it and run
Think it's a game?Just check out how my format is done
Stoppin' ya shine and I do it to perfection
Made a promise every time I touch the mic to bless 'em
Used to tease me how I keep is greasy just to test 'em
Eve handcuff niggas but I don't arrest 'em
Shorty-bang hear the niggas singin', shoutin' my name
Make the thuggish niggas scream, watchin' me entertain
Dicks brick when I lick the lips, just keepin' it plain
Fantasizin' 'bout this bitch, got 'em goin' insane
Ooh's and ah's, 5'7" thick in the thighs
Every thugs dream wife, see the love in they eyes?
My time to shine, whole package make her a dime
Want some more? It ain't over, just keep pressin' rewind, uh
