How you like me now, this chick is so bubbery
Emphasize thighs on your Spanish bedspread
Ain't no Kate Moss, Mama kept me well fed
Hooked on phonics, Special K, special people, special ed
I do my own thing just let your head nod
To the punks with mohawks and the naughty dreadlocks
To the chubby chicks in your dorm
Knock 'em out they socks
No, we don't discriminate and we don't cock-block
See Mapei LiveGet tickets as low as $110You might also likeClaim another year girl, just wanna have fun
Power to the people 'cause they stuck in Babylon
Run up in your area, you better gimme some
And we don't stop 'til we go platinum
