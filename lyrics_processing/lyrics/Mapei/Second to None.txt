Taking all what's left to the bone, still the stomach exploded
Call the local hero over, now we're all floating
Party till a life is missing, crying till we're choking
Yesterday's champion, now the man is doping
Eyes on the prizes, stores are never open
Welcome to the life of, where nothing's ever boring
A lost generation still waiting for their calling
(X2)
The day that I win I'll be second to none
Some of us die trying, some of us give up
I say I'll be damned if you're testing my luck
The day that I win I'll be second to none
Running down the main street, got me feeling like a young girl
Running down the main street, got me feeling like a young girl
Running down the main street, got me feeling like a young girl
Running down the main street, got me feeling like a young girl
If god bless you and either and god bless he
Who paved the way to heaven and put us on the lease?
Our house look so soulful, that's why we're so beatifull
Speakers bumping loud, but I can still hear those vocals
Graduation day, and they rose to toast you
Which means emancipation day, now what more can you do?
You can do magic happen or what we call voodoo
A bitter sweet generation but nothing is boring
Hard working generation still waits for their calling

The day that I win I'll be second to none
Some of us die trying, some of us give up
I say I'll be damned if you're testing my luck
The day that I win I'll be second to none
I produced nothing, I failed something
Work hard no playing games and pretend you love it
You becomes so fake to yourself that is disgusting
For better or for worse or for the fighting and fussing
A flock of people, we're just waiting around
While the government keeps finding ways to keep us safe and sound
So we stay on the block pound for pound
Until the truth comes around yeah, comes around
A generation that stay awoke until dawn
A generation awaits their final call
Running down the main street, got me feeling like a young girl
(X2)
The day that I win I'll be second to none
Some of us die trying, some of us give up
I say I'll be damned if you're testing my luck
The day that I win I'll be second to none
Running down the main street, got me feeling like a young girl
Running down the main street, got me feeling like a young girl
Running down the main street, got me feeling like a young girl
