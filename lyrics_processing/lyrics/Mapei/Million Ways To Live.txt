Pack your backpack
Swinging, banging, rolling deep
Like the Rat Pack
Steady riding on the beat
Okay, now clap clap
Where them hands at?
Moving my hips and my feet
I know you like that

It's just the state that I'm in
Ain't no need for me to pretend
You pick me up when I feel alone
Now I'm back on my feet again
Okay now two step, under the sun
We don't care where you've been
Or where you're from

Okay, a million ways to live in this modern day
All the troubles that you're in, gon' wash 'em away
Mad world, it's a fact
Put it in your hashtag
Only one life to live, you never gonna get it back
Let's go

Even if the road is long
And I'm many many miles from home

Many many miles from home
Don't look back, you know better than that

Even though the road is long
And we're many many miles from home

Jetlag
Feeling like I'm in my zone
Just had a flashback
To the days that we were young
Let's take it way back
Papa was a rollin' stone
And mama told me
If I have a heart, I have a home

A million ways to live in this modern day
All the troubles that you're in, gon' wash 'em away
Mad world, it's a fact
Put it in your hashtag
Only one life to live, you never gonna get it back
Let's go
Even if the road is long
And I'm many many miles from home
This is where we all belong
Many many miles from home
Don't look back, you know better than that
