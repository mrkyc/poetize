I was alone by the bar on a Sunday
My week has been just like hell
My 9 to 5 gonna quit that shit someday
Oh, I got a story to tell
I just got paid, was about to brag
Then I saw this man and then he said hello
And all his charm nothing I really have
But he made me feel so damn beautiful
I said wait, let me visit the ladies
He said please don't go
And when I came back he was nowhere to be found
My purse and all my money was gone

Don't say hello hello hello
If you're gonna steal my heart and go
I'd rather be alone alone alone
Don't say hello hello
Don't say hello hello

Ok, so I was high on a Monday
High off life and high off love
Work at the supermarket and I was so late ooo
Because I was still drunk
And there he was this tall young man
Should I call the cops or should
I let him go
But I went up to him and I said
Baby, I'll quit my job if you take me home
All of a sudden this girl came in with my
Green Louis Vuitton
Hey, that's my purse and you are thief
Then he act like he ain't know us at all

If you gonna steal my heart and go
I'd rather be alone alone alone
Don't say hello hello
Don't say hello hello hello
If you're gonna steal my heart and go
I'd rather be alone alone alone
Don't say hello hello
Don't say hello hello hello
If you're gonna steal my heart and go
I'd rather be alone alone alone
Don't say hello hello
