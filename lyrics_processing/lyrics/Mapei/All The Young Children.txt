If one man is bored then we'll all go under
That's why we never get up
Same shit winter, summer
Fight one another
Cry babies, no wonder
Black chicks, no confidence, no wonder
It's the same everywhere
We're last, no wonder
Same shit winter, summer
Fighting one another
We can't change shit so we stay undercover
Same shit, same shit
Winter, fall, summer
Winter give me spring I'm just tryna' see the light
See no evil, hear no evil, that's the only way to fight
You may say that I'm a dreamer
We're all dreamers so goodnight
Martin Louie King had a dream too, so bright, right
Here we ain't shit
We can't say what's on our minds
If we say what's on our minds, then we might get fined
One hit, two hit
Pusher man, please
If we don't push units then we might push trees
Now Y2K, you put that voudou on me
Like when you have the girls sayin' brown sugar baby
One man, many men used to have a mother
She's been long gone since their 19th summer
If you don't give a damn, then we don't give a what
Everybody join the 27 club
If 6 was 9 then we'd all die young
Put the needle on the record 'cause the damage is done

All the young children on smack

They deserve something better
Let's give them something better

Crystal meth, hazelnut started a band
Tamika and Tamara could not relate to them
Every 3 or 4 years being black is a trend
Then a white chick's a hoe 'cause she has a black friend
One step forward, two steps back again
Well, what do I know?
I'm just tryna' make it make sense
No wonder why we always wanna' make sense
At department stores buying more
But we're still complainin'
This right here is a report from overseas
Where some kids don't really care about their A-B-Cs
'Cause they looked at us like 1, 2, 3
Made us feel dumb, now we numb, whoopsy
PCP, and LSD
MDMA, XTC
HRN, DET
C-O-C-A-I-N-E
Next time won't you sing with us
'Cause our room's all dirty from the angel dust

They deserve something better
Let's give them something better
All the young children on smack
All the young children on crack
They deserve something better
Let's give them something better
