Baby, I'm riding down the freeway
Got some money to spend
Where you wanna go with me?
Take this, dumb off all your bag now
Just come put it on me, it only gets better
We out this mother

Come on, baby
Nothing is as hard as a lonely heart
You should be my man, baby
Come on, baby
Nothing is as hard as a lonely heart
You should be my man, baby
Come on, baby

I could be the one to protect you
Nothing bad will affect you
In your eyes all I see is me, yeah
That's right, the roles are reversed now
It seems like you're really feeling me
Am I worthy of pursuit
If so, tell me now

Most dudes out there ain't quite like you
I've got a pocket full of love, and a couple of suits
Can we take a long ride until the sun is due?
I put my mag down, how about me and you
Gang, ain't no feeling better than to have you by my side
Ask me for whatever, and I'll tell you it's alright
You should be my man, I should be your bride
Not just for the night, but for the rest of our lives
Come on

You should be my man, not only my friend
Try to understand, I need you
Oh, yes I do

You should be my man, baby
