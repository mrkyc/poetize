It goes music
It goes music
Love, melancholy shrugs
Reflection of the red sky, I show no love
No mercy to them weirdos, my soul's dispersed
Humbling the past, future's black, the sun is cursed, it's like
I got the earth in my palms, I'm mad calm, on some next shit, 
It's lifelong however, take your time out, that shit is real
But the sky's infrared yo with beams to kill

If I shall die, I would say no one is to blame, for my lonely heart
Cause this city's dead, off with his head, they put us all to shame
Problems still unsolved

You better choose your life, you're losing life, you're losing life
Real recognise real
Emotionally paralysed, you're paralysed, you're paralysed
That's just the way that I feel

I'm packing my bags, I'm gone for the winter
Oh my, oh my, oh my, what a hell of a year
I'm packing my bags, I'm gone for the winter
Come roll with me, it's time to get up out of here

Fly side by side in the desert breeze
I will never change
How you like me raw?
Strong will cry for the weak man's pain
And the earth will do the same
Cause it's nature's law

It ain't like I choose to cry
I'm born to fly, lose my mind
It's just the way that I feel
And I won't apologize, apologize, apologize
Real recognize real

I'm packing my bags, I'm gone for the winter
Oh my, oh my, oh my, what a hell of a year
I'm packing my bags, I'm gone for the winter
Come roll with me, it's time to get up out of here

We be want me piece of mind
But the man want stress
Me cold as ice
Cold as ice, ice, ice, ice
Don't you leave me there or here
Don't you leave me
Don't you leave me there or here
