Cause now you're rockin' with the best, come on!
You are so concerned with sweet nothings
That it makes you die inside
Why succumb to the pressure
Go where you belong
In my eyes, you are beautiful
As could be, quit being insecure
Nothing in this world is what it seems
In the world so unsure
I believe in you
And nothing in this world can make my feet fall to the ground
I believe in you
Every tear is a waterfall
Every morning's an open door
We gon' make it
I've been here before, baby
When your back is against the wall
And you thought you lost it all
Don't worry, I've been here before, baby
Cause now you're rockin' with the best, come on!
Cause now you're rockin' with the best, come on!
