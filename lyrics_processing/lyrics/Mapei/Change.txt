Real love is all around
It won't let you down
You are royalty, waiting to be crowned
And if that love is the truth
It will come right back to you
It's beautiful inside of you
It's all there for you, it's true

Don't you worry about a thing my brother
A little love is all it takes
Don't you worry about a thing my sister
We're all waiting for a change
We're all waiting for a change
We are, we are
We're all waiting for a change
We are, we are...

We try hard to get by
Try to keep our dreams alive
By any means, no hesitation
When you can see the light
Even in your darkest night
I know, I know, a change gonna come
It's all there for you
It's true
