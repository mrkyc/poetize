But you still cannot read these words
Cannot read these words
The palms of your hands tell the future
But you were born with no hands
Born with no hands
You've been putting hexes on your exes
And pretending to know what sex is
While the children are slipping through the cracks of the system
You've been trying to get some
Trying to convince her
While the children are slipping through the cracks of the system
Slipping through the cracks of the system
You've been talking to the dead
You've been talking to the dead
You've been talking to the dead
We want to be alive
I want to be alive
We want to be alive
You've been talking to the dead
We want to be alive
I want to be alive
We want to be alive
But you've got your lucky rabbit's foot
But that lucky rabbit lost his foot
Lost his foot
Oh and you trust astrology, and psychology
But you still can't fix yourself
You can't fix yourself
You've been putting hexes on your exes
And pretending to know what sex is
While the children are slipping through the cracks of the system
You've been trying to get some
Trying to convince her
While the children are slipping through the cracks of the system
Slipping through the cracks of the system
