You don't see the world the way I do
Your eyes, they no longer search for truth
Because you found it
I don't feel used when I'm with you
I don't feel abused when I'm with you
Oh no
Oh no

You're not out for blood
You only want what's beautiful
You're not out for blood
You're in love with truth
You're not out for blood
You only want what's beautiful
You're not out for blood
You're in love with truth

I wanna be someone more like you
(Someone more like you)
Someone more like you
Oh I wanna be someone more like you
(Someone more like you)

I want my eyes to be like yours
I want to know what defines my worth
Oh please, can you tell me?
I don't feel used when I'm with you
I don't feel abused when I'm with you
Oh no
Oh no

You're not out for blood
You only want what's beautiful
You're not out for blood
You're in love with truth
You're not out for blood
You only want what's beautiful
You're not out for blood
You're in love with truth

I wanna be someone more like you
(Someone more like you)
Someone more like you
Oh, I wanna be someone more like you
(Someone more like you)

I need you to teach me, teach me
Teach me, teach me
What you know

I need you to teach me, teach me
Teach me, teach me
What you know
What you know!

Is this what it's like to see through your eyes?
Is this what it's like to see?
Is this what it's like to see through your eyes?
Is this what it's like to see?

I wanna be someone more like you
(Someone more like you)
Someone more like you
I wanna be someone more like you
(Someone more like you)
