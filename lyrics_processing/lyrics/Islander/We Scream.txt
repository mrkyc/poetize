Call truth a lie man
Record so clean it gleam like diamonds on your ice, man
We know you trippin', dippin', sippin' on some turpentine
Lace your words with cocaine verbs
Whip us quicker than that lambo time
Veils you drop like drop tops on that rari
We all know you copped on lowkey deals where we got robbed
Hand over fist like you the mob
We scream
You already know
You turned your backs on us, we're not letting go
We scream
You already know
You lie, cheat, and steal and we won't let it go
They say that I'm the bad guy, laser beams for eyes guy
I'm the the Superman no kryptonite
You can't deflect, you can't deny
You can run my name through the dirt
You ain't the first
Yeah, you is low, but I am the worst
Considered a curse
Destined since birth to make sure this justice is served
I'll carry you if I have to
Bury you if I have to
Bound and gagged with that dirty rag I used to clean your mess if I have to
