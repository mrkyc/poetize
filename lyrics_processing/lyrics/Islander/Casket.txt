Hey, sweet little thing
Why are you looking so cold?
You want the secret to life
Come and give me your time
I'll teach you this song
You've got to break the chains
You've got to hear me out
We were born to die and now I know why
That's what life is about

So you can put me in a casket and lay it in a grave
Write my name on a tombstone, but I promise I'm okay
Throw my body in a river
Or burn it up in the flames
Write my name on a tombstone
I'm asking death "Where is your sting?"
I said it

They blinded my eyes
They never told me the truth
I was obsessed with death
But now I confess that I broke the rules
And now here they come for you
They're here to drag you away
Would you rather be devoured by the hounds of hell
Or would you rather say...
You might also like
You can put me in a casket and lay it in a grave
Write my name on a tombstone, but I promise I'm okay
Throw my body in a river
Or burn it up in the flames
Write my name on a tombstone
I keep asking death "Where is your sting?"
I said it

"Where is your sting?"
I keep asking death "Where is your sting?"
I keep asking death "Where is your sting?"

There'll be no x's over my eyes
There'll be no x's over my eyes
You can put me in a casket and lay it in a grave
Write my name on a tombstone, but I promise I'm okay

You can put me in a casket and lay it in a grave
Write my name on a tombstone, but I promise I'm okay
Throw my body in a river
Or burn it up in the flames
Write my name on a tombstone
I'm asking death "Where is your sting?"
I said it
"Where is your sting?"
I keep asking death "Where is your sting?"
"Where is your sting?"
