You're waking up at five a.m.
You've dreamt the factory dream again, oh oh
The grinding of the great machines
With shining steel like guillotines, oh oh
And someone saying to you, "Oh, don't let go
I've been just like kinda caught in a roll
Never getting out, never getting out"

But the morning is here on your stairs
He's holding up his sharp golden spears
And tries his very best to put on airs to get you out

And he is coming for you
To brighten bleaker days
And all the things that you do
Are never lost in space
But they shine like neon rays
To spell "liberty"
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh!
You might also like
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Catch yourself by the toe, oh oh oh, oh oh
So afraid you had a choice
To speak with someone else's voice

But it is coming with a cost to climb the wall
The outside it is steep if you fall
You're walking on the blade of a knife
Oh, what a gift to get!

And it was given to you
To brighten bleaker days
(Oh! You know you're shinin', you know you...)
And all the things that you do
They are never lost in space
But they shine like neon rays
To spell "liberty"
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh, the pink piano!

So eeny, meeny, meeny, my, miny, moe
I think you have caught your pinky toe
But someday soon, you will grow
And your neon rainbow will start to glow
And he is coming for you
To brighten bleaker days
(Oh! You know you're shinin', you know you...)
And all the things that you do
They are never lost in space
But they shine like neon rays
To spell "liberty"
Oh oh oh oh oh
To spell "victory"
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, to spell "freedom"
Oh oh oh oh oh
