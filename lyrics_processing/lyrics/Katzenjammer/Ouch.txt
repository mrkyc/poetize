It bit me in my bones
Jumped up and bit me in my bones
It picked a fight, took an ugly bite
It fell on the floor, and now it's out the door

It got me way off guard
Really, really, really got me way off guard
It picked a fight, took an ugly bite
It fell on the floor, and now it's out the door

I've got a Donald Duck bandage, but the wound won't heal
I've got lavender balm, but the pain still feels
Like a desert on fire with no look for rain
And this pill is too small to heal the pain

Ouch! Ouch!
Oh my Lord, my sweet Lord
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Oh my Lord, oh oh oh
Oh my Lord, my sweet Lord
Oh my Lord, oh oh oh

I said it bit me in my bones
I said it bit, bit, bit me in my bones
I said it bit me in my bones
Now here I want to take it to the higher tones
I said it bit me in my bones
I said it bit, bit, bit me in my bones
I said it bit me in my bones
Now take it to the floor

I've got a Donald Duck bandage, but the wound won't heal
I've got lavender balm, but the pain still feels
Like a desert on fire with no look for rain
And this pill is too small to heal the...

I got myself too mean
I've got no love for thee
I've got to say
Oh my Lord, my sweet Lord
There ain't no time for this
There ain't no time for bliss
I say, stop!
Oh my Lord, oh oh oh
Oh my Lord, my sweet Lord
Oh my Lord, oh oh oh
