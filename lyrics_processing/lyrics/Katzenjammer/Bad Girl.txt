Bad girl, bad girl
Go hide away, go hurl
That friggin' skirt of yours
That is way too short for my mama and me
Bad girl, bad girl
Don't be too comfy with yourself
We'll be at your back with a hack to stand
And watchin' you bleed
High on lies
My tongue is tired and dry
I wish for you to come and buy my whiskey
Give me some of that old lovers' song
I need my fix but not your flak now, honey

Go hide away, go home
You biggie bawd
Go hide away, go home
You ball of odd
We'll weed you out like a bug, like a punk
Like a bawdy, little...

Bad girl, bad girl
Go hide away, go hurl
Those friggin' friends of yours
We're short of those, but we'll mock you for it
You might also likeHey!

Mmmm, by and by
My skirt will stay up high
And there is plenty of room for more acquaintance
Cry and cry
But not for your remarks
So you go put that in your pipe and smoke it

Go hide away, go home
You biggie bawd
Go hide away, go home
You ball of odd
We'll weed you out like a bug, like a punk
Like a bawdy, little...

Bad girl, bad girl
Don't be too sure
We'll stick around for you no more
On your dirty floor, not Papa nor me
Hey!
My oh my, you pry into my mind
I'm gonna riddle yours till you turn scarlet
I'll revolt, and you'll deceive your souls
It's to yourselves you are not true, you harlots

Go hide away, go home
You biggie bawd
Go hide away, go home
You ball of odd
We'll weed you out like a bug, like a punk
Like a bawdy, little...

Bad girl, bad girl
Go hide away, go hurl
That friggin' skirt of yours
That is way too short for my mama and me
Bad girl, bad girl
Don't be too sure
We'll stick around for you no more
On your dirty floor, not Papa nor me

Bad girl, bad girl
Go hide away
Bad girl
Bad girl, bad girl
Go hide away
