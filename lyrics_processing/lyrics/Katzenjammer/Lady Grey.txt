Lady Grey, you tell a smile
What is your secret, what's your lie?
You lived a long, hard life
Your memory may fade, but you're still wise
I wonder where you've been
What you've accomplished, what you've seen
In such a long, hard life
Did you ever dance, were you someone's wife?

Take me, take me away
Way back to the days when you were
Crazy, crazy for living
Oh, sweet twenty-nine
And you looked fine
And you looked fine

Lady Grey, dressed up so nice
Where do you go when you close your eyes?
Do you hear the words I say
And can you remember yesterday?
What do you comprehend?
Can you even feel me in your hand?
Lady Grey, with your knockout smile
Hoping you feel it was worth the while
You might also like
Take me, take me away
Way back to the days when you were
Crazy, crazy for living
Oh, sweet twenty-nine
And you looked fine
You looked fine

Lady Grey, no doubt that time
Has withered your hands, but still your smile
Is as sparkling as way back when
You broke the hearts of all young men
Lady Grey, when I see you now
Sick in your bed, but still you smile
When you hear the music play
Wonder how it would be if you could...

Take me, take me away
Way back to the days when you were
Crazy, crazy for living
Oh, sweet twenty-nine
And you looked fine
Take me, take me away
Way back to the days when you were
Crazy, crazy for living
Oh, sweet twenty-nine
And you looked fine
(Lady Grey, you tell a smile)
Oh, you looked fine
(Lady Grey, you tell a smile)
Oh, you looked fine
(Lady Grey, you tell a smile)
Oh, my lay, lay, lay...
My Lady Grey
