"Nine hours passed, and how long will it last?"
Says the man with the plan and a gun in his hand
He's scared but prepared it might be as he feared
"Are they still in control and safe behind the wall?"
This evening's too quiet, oh, we need a real riot
To shake, and to break, and to bite like a snake
We're stuck in this attic, so bored and so static
Tomorrow they'll ask us to throw off our masks

But the storm is a-coming 'cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight
The storm is a-coming 'cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts... that should fight!
(Hey!)

Mary's like me, she's a loser-to-be
Got a lock on her door and a bed on the floor
You will know they will win, and then they'll come in
There's nothing you can say to lead them astray
We still live in silence like sworn threats of violence
I long for an end, and it's coming around the bend
If we lived through this night and we'd still be all right
We'd flee to Siam or a bar in Amsterdam

But the storm is a-coming 'cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight
The storm is a-coming 'cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts... that should fight!
(Hey, hey, hey!)

But the storm is a-coming 'cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight
The storm is a-coming 'cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts...
And the storm is a-coming 'cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts that should fight
The storm is a-coming 'cross the hills tonight
