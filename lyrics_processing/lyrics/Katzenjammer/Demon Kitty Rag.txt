Here kitty, kitty
There's too much demon blood
In these self-appointed angels
Acting like you're comatose
Speaking like a country rose
Or a preacher's pet in drag
Banging on a kettledrum
Won't make you notice me
Though you're bored beyond belief
Sucking on an old man's thumb
Man, it makes me feel so numb
Gonna teach you how to make it feel good
Hey

I'll be your nightmare mirror
Do what you do to me
I'll be your nightmare mirror
Colder than a steel blade


Get them while they're younger
Yes, someone told me that
But man, I never saw it coming
Gonna let myself go soon
Man, I'm gonna tear it down
And maybe take my kitty with me
You might also likeGirl, you need some discipline
Girl, you need some medicine
Even though my heart is breaking
Never gonna straight you up
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
Can't seem to teach you how to make it feel good
Yeah

I'll be your nightmare mirror
Do what you do to me
I'll be your nightmare mirror
Colder than a steel blade
