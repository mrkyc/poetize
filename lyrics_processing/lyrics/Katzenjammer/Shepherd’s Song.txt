The sun is up for me
But I know a beauty that shines it out
I can hardly see
When she is up letting her veil down
But it could never be
I'm just a shepherd hiding from the hounds
She's a fantasy
With flowers and bows, pretty coats, and a silver crown

Every day goes by
The sun and the moon making out in the sky
We keep each other warm
Snuggling up in the dark, Mr. Sheep and I
Join my favorite dream
She sings me lullabies all through the night
And wakes me with a kiss
Sweet taste of apples and wild strawberries
I'm in love with her majesty

(What you gonna do?)
Oo, I wanna build this dream for two
(What's it gonna be?)
I'm jumpin' up and down, but she can't see
(I think you got a chance
Just move on over and ask her to dance)
I got silly feet and a lousy beat
So how on earth can I make her want me?
You might also like
I think it's gonna rain today
But I'm here on one hill, and she's on the other
The clouds are in my way
As the sky opens up letting her vail down
Covering my queen
Well, I'm still a shepherd, so why should I bother?
The valley in between
Gets deeper and deeper as time passes by
Gonna love her till I die
So why don't I
Just make like a prince and give it a try?

(What's it gonna be?)
I could slingshot myself like a bumblebee
(What you gonna do?)
Use Mr. Sheep as a parachute
(On the count of three!)
I'm off to claim my fantasy
In my best clothes
Buttoned up with a rose
I'm on my way to make you love me

I'll be your man
In your castle made of sand
Watch your head, my love, I'm coming over
Just so that I can hold your hand
La la la la la...

(On the count of three)
Aiming at the apple tree
(On the count of two)
I'm gonna slingshot myself like a bumblebee
(On the count of one!)
Okay, here I go, in a minute or so
