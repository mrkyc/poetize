These are the things that I love in life
Songs of a war and a Friday night
So close to you
In the car, in the dark, aha
I play the local hero part
Eyes fixed on me, I never let you down
So this is it
I want more
A big score, aha

Down through the ribbon highway I will go
Searching for a brighter spotlight, a brighter sun
I am out on the open road
I am more than a kick, and I'm more than a spark
I am more than a flash in the dark

A brigth new morning in Neonville
In my cowboy boots and my leotard
I've got my lips all red
The drama's on, aha
The day has burned out at the quickest pace
I wanted to win, but I lost the race
So this is it
I want more
The noble floor, aha

Down through the ribbon highway I will go
Searching for a brighter spotlight, a brighter sun
I am out on the open road
I am more than a kick, and I'm more than a spark
I am more than a flash in the dark

I am more, I am more than a flash in the dark
I am more, I am more than a flash in the dark
I am more, I am more than a flash in the dark
I am more, I am more...

Down through the ribbon highway I will go (yeah, yeah)
Searching for a brighter spotlight, a brighter sun
I am out on the open road
I am more than a kick, and I'm more than a spark
I am more than a flash in the (dark)
Down through the ribbon highway I will go
(I am more than a flash in the dark)
Searching for a brighter spotlight, a brighter sun
I am out on the open road
I am more than a kick, and I'm more than a spark
