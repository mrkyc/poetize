Deserted neglected into the dark
Devitalised souls cripple the planet in greed
Proceed until we are Absorbed in blood
Causing the premature burial of nature
With the spark to a powder keg
Pining up their toys on the shoulders of the nation
Turning death into universal heir
Make us die slowly
Nuclear winter
Clouds of dust will hide the sun forever
Nuclear winter
Blows straight into your heart
Nuclear winter
Day of tomorrow we'll go through
Make you testament
Nuclear winter
Luminaries become dall structures
Atmospheric cataclysm is the result
Epileptic doom of lacerated cannibals
Wrapped up the earth in a shroud
Eternal darkness artificial brightness
Exclusive possession of death
Defaced skulls of radiation
Mutilated past recognition
You might also likeMake us die slowly
Nuclear winter
Clouds of dust will hide the sun forever
Nuclear winter
Blows straight into your heart
Nuclear winter
Day of tomorrow we'll go through
Make you testament
Nuclear winter
Slow death is what we can expect
Strike will have just this one effect
Condemned to capital punishment
By the nuclear sword of Damocles
Disappeared without leaving a trace
Mans dignity and grace
Infected by intruder organism
Changed into weak willed subjects
Ineradicable misanthropy
We stick to nothing
Instinct of self preservation
Spreading venereal disease
Gods of war and vengeance
Commander with good conscience
Use our soul for research
In favour of nuclear technology
Arrived at the end of the spiral staircase
At the doorstep to immortality
Not reached the destination of our dreams
Decided in the struggle for existence
Life has lost, death has won the game
The length of our longing
Shall be the strength of our glory
Damocles proud and mighty among men
Make us die slowly
Nuclear winter
Clouds of dust will hide the sun forever
Nuclear winter
Blows straight into your heart
Nuclear winter
Day of tomorrow we'll go through
Make you testament
