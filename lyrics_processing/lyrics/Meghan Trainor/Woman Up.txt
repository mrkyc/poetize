Put your favorite heels on

And to keep your head up
Like Madonna would
Wear a lipstick redder than wine

Roll your bumper and wine slow
Show the world you can shine, glow

All my girls, raise your hand
If you don't need a man
'Cause you're more than good enough
You gotta woman up, woman up
Don't matter what you been through
Just make them remember you
