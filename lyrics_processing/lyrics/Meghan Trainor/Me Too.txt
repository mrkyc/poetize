Ow!

Who's that sexy thing I see over there?
That's me, standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thing hangin' 'round my neck? Mm
That's gold, show me some respect (Oh-ah)

I thank God every day (Uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (Uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, no

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too

I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to VIP
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do

I thank God every day (Thank God, uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (And I feel good, uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself (Woo)
And I don't need nobody else, no (No, no, baby)

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too (Oh, ayy)
If I was you (I would wanna), I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too (Hey, hey)

Ow! Turn the bass up
Turn the bass up
Ow! Turn the bass up
Let's go

I thank God every day (Said, I thank God, uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (Uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself (Ow!)
And I don't need nobody else, no (No, no, baby)

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too (Oh)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too (Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
