Please don't make promises that you can't keep
Your best intentions end up hurtin' me
No matter what, I'll love you endlessly
I know we're blood, but this love is bad for me

I can't tell you what I wanna say
'Cause I, I'm afraid that you won't change
Sometimes I just wanna scream in your face
But when you're in pain, you just walk away

And my, my therapist told me to write you a letter, mm
She said if I did, it would make me feel better
But it wouldn't do shit even if I sent it
'Cause you won't get it, you're too damn selfish, mm

Please don't make promises that you can't keep
Your best intentions end up hurtin' me
No matter what, I'll love you endlessly
But I gotta run, I gotta run from your reality
I know we're blood, but this love is bad for me

Damn, it's hard for me to let go
Of someone I held so close, mm
Damn, it's hard for me to draw that line
And leave you on the other side

But my, my therapist told me to write you a letter, mm
She said if I did, it would make me feel better, oh
But it wouldn't do shit even if I sent it
'Cause you won't get it, you're too damn selfish, oh

Please don't make promises that you can't keep
Your best intentions end up hurtin' me
No matter what, I'll love you endlessly
But I gotta run, I gotta run from your reality
I know we're blood, but this love is bad for me

And when you lie (And when you lie)
There's a part of you that dies
That I'm left with (I'm left with)
It gets hectic (It gets hectic)
When you lie (And when you lie)
I wonder why I try
But you can't help it, you're too damn selfish, mm

Please don't make promises that you can't keep
'Cause your best intentions end up hurtin' me
No matter what, I'll love you endlessly
But I gotta run, I gotta run from your reality
I know we're blood, but this love is bad for me
