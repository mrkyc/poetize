So cold, alone
Could you be my blanket?
Surround my bones
When my heart feels naked
No strength, too weak
I could use some saving
And your love's so strong
Like a pill, I'd take it

I'd take it, I'd take it
Like a pill, your love, I'd take it
I'd take it, I'd take it
Like a pill, your love, I'd take it

When my world gets loud
Could you make it quiet down?
When my head, it pounds
Could you turn down all the sound?
If I lay in pain
By my side, would you stay?
If I need you now
Would you kindly calm me down?

When my heart's not pure
Would you kill my disease?
And when there's no cure
You are just what I need
When I lose my mind
Would you still remind me?
When I'm feeling lost
Would you come and find me?

I'd take it, I would take it
Like a pill, your love, I'd take it
I'd take it, I'd take it
Like a pill, your love, I'd take it
