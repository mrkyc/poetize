I can't believe I'm still doing this
I told myself a month ago that I'd be through with this
I'm looking at my phone, and wondering if you're home
I'm kinda tipsy, I ain't tryna sleep alone
Somebody told me that some other girl was hugging you
Baby, you know I'm the one that should be loving you
You know we had a thing, baby, it's such a shame
I still get crazy every time I hear your name

And I know it's complicated
But you know I'm impatient

3 AM
Yo, I'm texting you once again
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no
3 AM
I might be looking for a late night friend
And baby, I can't get you out my head
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no

Kinda stressing like I'm gonna have a heart attack
It's been an hour and you haven't even hit me back
Baby, keep it real, tell me what's the deal
'Cause I miss you, you don't know how this feels

And I know it's complicated
This always happens when I'm wasted

3 AM
Yo, I'm texting you once again
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no
3 AM
I might be looking for a late night friend
And baby, I can't get you out my head
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no

I know, I know, I know it's so wrong
Somebody take away my phone
'Cause I've been drinking all night long
All night long, all night long
I know, I know, I know it's so wrong
Somebody take away my phone
'Cause I've been drinking all night long
All night long, all night long

3 AM
Yo, I'm texting you once again
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
I can't help it, I can't help myself, no

And baby, I can't get you out my head
