That's my evil twin
That's my evil twin

It wasn't me, she started it
I said just one, then she got lit
She takes control, she's in my head
Making me make my bad decisions, but I'm innocent
Two Tylenol for what she did
So dehydrated, that crazy bitch
I've had enough, so over it
Making me make my bad decisions, but I'm innocent

I get lost in the background
She the star of the show
Gotta deal with her problems
When she lose control
I know I can't tame her
I don't even try
So let me apologize

(That's my evil twin) No, it ain't my fault
(That's my evil twin) It wasn't me at all
Don't be mad at me
I can't help that she's a wild one, baby, wild one, baby

I never yell, but she can scream
She loves to give me anxiety
She talks too much, she never quits
Making me make my bad decisions while I'm innocent (Yeah)

I get lost in the background (Uh)

Gotta deal with her problems
When she lose control
I know I can't tame her
I don't even try
So let me apologize

(That's my evil twin) No, it ain't my fault

I can't help that she's a wild one, baby, wild one, baby

That's my evil twin (Hey)
That's my evil twin
That's my evil twin
Even though she crazy, gotta love her 'cause she half of me
Jealous of her confidence and how she moves her body, no
But she ain't always right, I'm talkin' 'bout last night
So let me apologize

(That's my evil twin) No, it ain't my fault
(That's my evil twin) It wasn't me at all
Don't be mad at me (No)
I can't help that she's a wild one, baby, wild one, baby (Yeah)

That's my evil twin (Woo, hey)
