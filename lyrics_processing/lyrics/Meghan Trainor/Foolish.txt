I was like, "Hi, nice to meet ya"
I could see me in your T-shirt
I could hear love from the speakers
I could see us in front of a preacher
Sayin' "I do" in my white dress
Fell so deep, I need a life vest
It don't usually happen like this
Nah-nah (Woo), nah-nah

And I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down
I said I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew (Hey)
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down (Uh)

They say that fools rush in, but I, oh, I
I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
They say that fools rush in, but I, oh, I (Hey)
I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you (Woo)
