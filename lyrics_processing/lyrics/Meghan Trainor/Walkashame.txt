Oh my god, I put my pants on inside-out
I couldn't tell 'cause the lights were out
I beat the sunrise again, oh-oh-oh
Neighbors stare, I smile and wave 'cause I just don't care
They're probably jealous of my sexy hair
And the heels in my hands

Well, please don't judge, it was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe
Well

Don't act like you haven't been there
7 AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame, but
My daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here's done the walk of shame

Oh my brain, little birdies sound like airplanes
How can something so cute cause me so much pain?

Well, please don't judge, it was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe
Well

Don't act like you haven't been there
7 AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame, but
My daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here's done the walk of shame

I might be walking, but it's only 'cause I'm out of breath
Don't even try to act like you ain't done the same yourself
And if you're gonna do the walk, do it like a boss
A boss, that's right
A little bit of rum in my tummy, yum, yum
I shook it up and danced like a dummy, dumb, dumb
He kissed me and called me his bae, asked me to stay
How could I turn that away?

Don't judge, it was mad late
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe
Don't act like you haven't been there
7 AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame, but
My daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here's done the walk of shame (Shame, oh)
Don't act like you haven't been there (Oh)
7 AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame
I said the walk, walk, walk
Do the walk, the walk, walk, walk
Do the walk, the walk, walk, walk
