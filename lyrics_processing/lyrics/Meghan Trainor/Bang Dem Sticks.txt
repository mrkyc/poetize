The dumb drummer, sicker than the swine flu
Don't really need medication, he got a tissue
And when he bang bangs, don't need to boogie
But he might be sweeter than my, my favorite cookie
When he plays, uh, he got a hold on me
In a race, yeah, he got the winning streak
And ain't nobody got a drummer like mine
He can bang dem sticks, he can throw dem high, ha!
