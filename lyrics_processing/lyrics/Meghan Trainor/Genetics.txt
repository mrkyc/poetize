G-E-N-E-T-I-C

Beauty queen since 17
At least to me, I was born with it
Maybelline is good to me
But I believe I was born with it

I work and work and work and
I've been working on myself
But I can't take cred 'cause it's from somebody else
Watch me work and work and work and
I've been sweating on myself
All them boys, all them girls, make 'em stop

How you get that bod?
Is it from God?
Did you work real hard?
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
How you get that bass?
Is it all fake?
Made in LA?

You see this face, I was born with it
I ain't ashamed to say one day I might upgrade
I could fuss with it

I work and work and work and
I've been working on myself
But I can't take cred 'cause it's from somebody else
Watch me work and work and work and
I've been sweating on myself
All them boys, all them girls, I make 'em stop
