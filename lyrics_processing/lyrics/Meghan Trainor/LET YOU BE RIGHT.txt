Love me, love me
Don't forget you love me
When I break things, make things
A little bit uncomfy

Baby, don't hate me
You probably think I'm crazy
And it's stupid and foolish
The way we've been behavin'
So, don't keep draggin' this on and on
When you know that you're wrong, you're wrong

I don't wanna fight tonight, I'ma let you be right
I don't wanna fight tonight, I'ma let you be right, let you be right
We can make up if you just kiss me at the next traffic light
I don't wanna fight tonight, I'ma let you be right, let you be right

Oh, let you be right, let you be right
Oh, let you be right (Woo)

Trust me, trust me
I need you to trust me
'Cause I say shit I don't mean
Words for me ain't easy
