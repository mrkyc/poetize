My selfish heart wasn't being no good to you
At least not the way it intended to, oh
Your love was young, but it warmed my old soul
When I said goodbye, I wasn't ready, no, whoa

But I don't wanna waste your time
No, you deserve to find the love of your life
One day you'll marry such a lovely wife
And hopefully we'll be fine

Baby, let's keep in touch, oh
'Cause I'm not what you need
But I'ma miss you so much
I'm too focused on this dream
And your kiss is a drug that pulls me back so quick
Until I pull us apart, well, forgive my selfish heart

Hey, baby, let's keep in touch
You got my number, baby, go ahead and call it up
You got my number, baby, go ahead and call it up
You got my number, baby, go ahead and call it up
Go ahead and call it up, go ahead and call it up
