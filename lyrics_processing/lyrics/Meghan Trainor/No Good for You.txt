I miss that happy friend that I had
You've been actin' so sad
Won't you come back? Yeah, yeah
You never take the town with your girls no more
Always with your new boy
But he ain't all that
But you don't know yet

His kiss is soft and sweet
And he swept you off your feet
But he's no good for you
He's no good for you
And sure, he's worth a lot of gold
But you're better than you know
He's no good for you
He's no good for you (Hey)

That boy's no good for you
You're way too good for him
That boy's no good for you, for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh no, he no good, he no good for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh no, he no good, he no good for you

He drives those fancy cars that you like
But he doesn't call you at night
And tells you he loves you
And he's thinking of you
No, you can't take him home for the holidays
Better keep him away
'Cause he's such a tool, girl
Everyone will say, I bet

His kiss is soft and sweet
And he swept you off your feet
But he's no good for you (No, no)
He's no good for you
And sure he's worth a lot of gold
But you're better than you know
He's no good for you (No, no)
He's no good for you (No, no)

That boy's no good for you
You're way too good for him
That boy's no good for you, for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh no, he no good, he no good for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh no, he no good, he no good for you
Won't you take it from a friend?
That boy is not a gentleman
And you'll find out soon enough
What you're feeling, it ain't love
'Cause he called me yesterday
And he asked me on a date
Tried to play you like a fool
And that's why I'm calling you

His kiss is soft and sweet
And he swept you off your feet
But he's no good for you
He's no good for you
And I'm sure he's worth a lot of gold
But you're better than you know (Better than you know)
He's no good for you (Better, babe)
Oh

His kiss is soft and sweet
And he swept you off your feet
But he's no good for you
He's no good for you
And I'm sure he's worth a lot of gold
But you're better than you know
He's no good for you (No, no)
He's no good for you
That boy's no good for you
You're way too good for him
That boy's no good for you, for you
That boy's no good for you
You're way too good for him
