You might have a mom, she might be the bomb
But ain't nobody got a mom like mine
Her love's 'til the end, she's my best friend
Ain't nobody got a mom like mine

She my world, she's my heart and there's no denying
I'm her girl no matter what even when I'm lying
She loving me, loving me, loving me, loving me, love
She love me like nobody else
I'm telling you, telling you, telling you, telling you all
She taught me how to love myself

You might have a mom, she might be the bomb
But ain't nobody got a mom like mine
Her love's 'til the end, she's my best friend
Ain't nobody got a mom like mine

See we go way back, oh, I remember
All the times that I cried, she made me feel better
She loving me, loving me, loving me, loving me, love
She love me like nobody else
I'm telling you, telling you, telling you, telling you all
She taught me how to love myself
