If you want my love
You gotta do what it does
If you want these sweet-like-sugar Gucci lips
You gotta give it up
I know you think I'm cool (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I ain't one of the boys (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, don't be scared that I'm gon' tie ya down (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ha, I need a little more

Baby, don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me
Naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
But if you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation
To kiss my ass goodbye

Give me that title, title
Come on, give me that title, title
Better give me that title, title
Come on, give me that title, title
