I'm the shh, be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet
I'm the shh, be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet

'Cause I just woke up
And I feel some type of way
I get all choked up
When I see how much I've made
And I feel so good
Like James Brown in his day, singing
Hey (Hey), hey (Hey), hey (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, woo)

Watch me do, watch me
Watch me do, watch me
Wha-da-do, watch me
Let me hear you sing
Hey (Hey), hey (Hey), hey, ow (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, woo)

I ain't saying I'm the besteses
But I got nice curves, nice breasteses
I don't erase the textes from my exeses
All in my DMs, leaving messages
Woo, head spinning like an exorcist
And I ain't a teacher, but the lesson is
If you wonder how I make it look effortless
The answer to your question is

Watch me do, I said watch me
Oh, wha-da-do (Come on), watch me
Let me hear you sing
Hey (Hey), hey (Hey), hey, ow (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, woo)

I'm the shh, be quiet

'Cause I just woke up (Good morning)
And I feel some type of way
