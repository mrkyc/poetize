When no one was there, you was there for me
When nobody cared, you still cared for me
If everyone leave you, be here with me
I hope that you're hearing me
Rock City

You keep me humble, keep me focused everyday
You know how to put a smile on my face
When I think about you, all my worries fade
You say you'll love me 'til forever and that'll never change

Oh, I hear your words
Oh, they don't go unnoticed
Oh, I feel your love

You know without you I got nothing, I got nothing
Without you I got nothing, I got nothing
Forever you're loyal and you know I adore you
Without you I got nothing, I got nothing

So I wanna, I wanna, I wanna thank you
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna thank you
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna thank you
Oh, oh, hey
