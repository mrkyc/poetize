I ain't tryna think about all my problems
I'm living now, I'm living now (Hey)
I can't sit and worry about the future
I'm living now, I said I'm living now

So put your hands up if you feel like having a good time
Put your hands up if you got no cares at all
Raise your cups if you got no work tomorrow
Put your hands up if you're ready to have some fun
Come on, sing

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive (Don't it feel good? Come on)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive (Come on)

Gonna wake up every day like it's Christmas
Gonna celebrate this life I'm given
From now on (From now on)
Gonna tell my mother every day I love her
And tell her, "Thanks for being such a good mother"
From now on

Feels good, don't it?
Living your life in this great moment
And you never ever think it's gonna go away, but I swear
I know you'll wake up one day and say
Yeah, I got things to do
Yeah, I got mountains to move
And it ain't about how sad it could be
It's about how good it should be

Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life; live in the moment
Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life; live in the moment
Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life; live in the moment
Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life; live in the moment (Come on, sing it)

Oh, it feels so good to be alive (So good, so good, hey)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life; live in the moment
