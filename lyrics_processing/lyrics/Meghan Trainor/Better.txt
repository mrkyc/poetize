Finally blew up in my face
Crash and burned to pieces
You got what you want from me
I gave you what you needed

I was warned, but fooled by charm
And you deserve to be alone

And I deserve better, better than you
I deserve better, better than you, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better

I used to cry to all my friends
But they would say, "I told ya"
Finally, I can breathe again
The weight is off my shoulders

I was warned, but fooled by charm
And you, you deserve to be alone

And I deserve better, better than you
I deserve better, better than you, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better

Let's talk about the word "deserve"
Or talk 'bout what the world deserves: a queen (You queen)
Let's talk about that four letter word (Love)
I think you deserve a king
I think you deserve the world and everything in it
And I try to go get it to show you I meant it when I
Tell you I'm sorry, tomorrow I promise that I
Try to be better, I'll do whatever for mine
And I ain't tryna be your friend's friends
Or your quote-unquote "fake friends," that's why I hate friends
I'd rather see you laugh than see you cry
I'd rather see you leave than tell a lie
And you ain't gotta say it, you deserve better

I deserve better, better than you
I deserve better, better than you, I deserve better
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better
