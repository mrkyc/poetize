I don't know about you, but baby, I love me
Now everybody say, hey-ay-ay

They gon' say all kinds of things
They'll make jokes about my name
They gon' try to clip my wings, but I'm gon fly (I'm gon' fly)
They'll try to play me like a game
I bet they're too scared of the fame
But I can see it clearer when I'm lookin' in the mirror
Saying God made me just right

I love me, I love me
I don't know about you, but baby, I love me
Now everybody say, hey-ay-ay
Oh, hey-ay-ay, I love me
Hey-hey-hey, I love me
