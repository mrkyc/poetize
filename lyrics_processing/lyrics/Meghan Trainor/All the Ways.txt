I need more details, more texts, calls, and emails
Be more specific, yes, I'm here to listen
I know I'm needy, but tell me you need me
No don't be afraid, babe, c'mon, explain

If you love me, love me, love me like you say
Darling, tell me all the ways, tell me all the ways

And he said all the ways, all the ways, all the ways
Tell me all the ways
And he said all the ways, all the ways (you love me), all the ways
Tell me all the ways, and he said

Take me out dancin', don't forget romancin'
And it's been a while since I've been your princess
Tell me your heart's blue when, when I'm not with you
Don't be afraid, babe, c'mon, explain

If you love me, love me, love me like you say
Darling, tell me all the ways, tell me all the ways
