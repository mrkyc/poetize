Mmm, hey, mmm
Hey

Don't think about it
Just move your body
Listen to the music
Sing, oh, ey, oh
Just move those left feet
Go ahead, get crazy
Anyone can do it
Sing, oh, ey, oh

Show the world you got that fire (Fire)
Feel the rhythm gettin' louder
Show the room what you can do
Prove to them you got the moves, hey
I don't know about you

But I feel better when I'm dancin', yeah, yeah
Better when I'm dancin', yeah, yeah
We can do this together
I bet you feel better when you're dancin', yeah, yeah
