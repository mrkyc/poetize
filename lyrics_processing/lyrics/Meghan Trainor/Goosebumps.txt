I was sitting at home on my sofa watching my favorite show
PJs, popcorn and ice cream with no make up on
My girls dragged me out to a party, I didn't wanna go
I walked in and that's when I saw you, my heart hit the floor

I get weird, I get shy and you are the reason why
I get weak, wanna die when you look me in the eye
Is it all in my mind? I can't bare a beat tonight
Oh, I, oh, I can't lie

I get goose, I get bumps
I get chills and I'm all shook up
I give in, I give up
I surrender to your love
I'm a fool, I'm a mess
Got my heart beating out of my chest
I get goose, I get bumps
I get chills and I'm all shook up
I get goosebumps, I get goosebumps
I get goosebumps, I get, woo-ooh-ooh

Try to find a brush in the bathroom, my hands start to sweat
I said to myself in the mirror, "I should've worn a dress"
Never seen something so perfect, baby, you're the best
So nervous, I'm 'bout to lose it, and I must confess

That I get weird, I get shy, and you are the reason why
I get weak, wanna die, when you look me in the eye
And I try to say, "Hi," I tried a million times
Oh, I, oh, I can't lie

I get goose, I get bumps
I get chills and I'm all shook up
I give in, I give up
I surrender to your love
I'm a fool, I'm a mess
Got my heart beating out of my chest
I get goose, I get bumps
I get chills and I'm all shook up
I get goosebumps, I get goosebumps
I get goosebumps, I get, whoo ooh ooh
I get goosebumps, I get goosebumps
I get goosebumps, I get, woo-ooh-ooh

Hey baby, every time you walk by
I get a little brrrr down my spine
I get, I get, I get, I get 'em
I get, I get, I get 'em goosebumps
I get, I get, I get, I get 'em
I get, I get, I get 'em goosebumps
I get goose, I get bumps
I get chills and I'm all shook up
I give in, I give up
I surrender to your love
And I'm a fool, I'm a mess
Got my heart beating out of my chest
I get goosebumps, I get goosebumps
I get goosebumps, I get, whoo ooh ooh
I get goosebumps, I get goosebumps
