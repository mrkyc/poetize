Ever after comes after we meet
I think the movies were lyin' to me
Oh my, how they lie
Know I'm ready to give you my heart
Just gotta find you so we can start
Oh yeah, but 'til then

I gotta be patient
But I'm tired of waitin', mm

I'm just a hopeless romantic
Lookin' for love
I'd risk it all just to have it
I wouldn't take it for granted
I'm just a hopeless romantic
Not givin' up, no
'Cause I deserve to find my own
I can feel it in my bones
Yes, I know you're somewhere close
Givin' me hope, mm-hmm

Bet we met at a party before
You were sweet and held open the door
Oh my, I should've said hi
So if you're out there and hearin' this song
Just know I'm here and you're takin' too long
Baby, come and find me
