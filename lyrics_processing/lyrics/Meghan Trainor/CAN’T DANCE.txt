I met this shy boy, cute as hell
And grabbed him by the hand
He pulled me back, I asked what's wrong
He said, "Oh, I can't dance"
I said, "That's fine, just keep in time
And show off what you got"
If you mess up, boy
I won't mind as long as you don't stop

Woah, na na, don't stop
Oh, na na, don't stop

Even if you can't dance, just hold my hips
Hold my hands while I roll my hips
Even if you can't dance, I'll handle it
Follow me and don't stop
Even if you can't dance, don't stand and watch
Stand and watch while I make it hot
Even if you can't dance, I'ma make it hot
Follow me and don't stop

Oh, na na, don't stop
Woah, na na, don't stop
