Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines (Ah-ha) working that Photoshop (Ah-ha)
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty (Ah-ha), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma, she told me, "Don't worry about your size"
(Shoo-wop, wop, shoo-wop, wop)
She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty, booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
(Shoo-wop, wop, shoo-wop, wop)
So, if that's what's you're into, then go ahead and move along
