I hate the silence, I feel the coldness of the floor
I see your face, like a shadow on the wall
I can smell your perfume, feel your lipps on my skin
I start to shiver while I cry, I feel the pain that hurts my heart
I count the tears, I count the days
I cannot find a way, but then I hear a quiet voice
So far away outside my room
I can't wake up, is this a dream?
Will I touch your skin again?
Look into my eyes now, feel the pain that I feel
Hold my hand and touch me
Taste the sin of my skin
Rain,rain,rain rain is falling in the night
Heals your pain, but he can never bring me back to life again
You can never bring me back to life again
(Rain,Rain,rain)rain is falling in the night
Heals my pain, but I can never bring her back to life again
I can never bring her back to life again
And when the rain is falling down
And all the shadows disappear
The darkness shows me where you are
And I can touch your skin again
You might also likeI start to shiver while I cry
I feel the pain that hurts my heart
I count the tears, I count the days
I cannot find a way, but then I hear a cried voice
So far away outside my room
I can't wake up, is this a dream?
Will I touch your skin again?
I can see you standing there, you are helpless like a child
You're addicted to my kiss, I kiss you in your dreams
Look into my eyes now, feel the pain that I feel
Hold my hand and touch me
Taste the sin of my skin
Rain rain rain, rain is falling in the night
Heals your pain, but he can never bring me back to life again
You can never bring me back to life again
(Rain rain rain) rain is falling in the night
Heals my pain, but I can never bring her back to life again
I can never bring her back to life again
And when the rain is falling down
And all the shadows disappear
The darkness shows me where you are
