My life is a dream
Damn, i can see the future
I never knew i would live this long to be a producer
Let's talk about losers and relationships
I met this, woman at my job, she's Caucasian and mixed
Ever since we laid eyes, she's been feeling the kid
But on different note ma, i got plans to get rich, only if 
She knew about all the places i lived, the things i did
And all the drugs that i slung
It's where I'm from
I'll never betray it
It's who i am, I'm stuck in the lab
It's past 2 am, this is for my friends and my family
Dreams of winning Grammy
But foreign parts of the world still don't understand me

How Deep is our bond ?

Had to put on you

How Deep is our bond ?

Damn i fell in love
And almost lost my soul , the woman of my dreams
Came and took me out of my zone
I felt so alone
But she barely knew
And the cards is telling me
She met a lot of dudes
That just wanted to screw
I'm not mad at you
U just won't open your eyes so you can see the truth
I'm not trying to disrespect you
Get with you, then neglect you
Them other guys never proposed nothing special
I'm blessed from the heavens, and so are you!
Our lives is looking just like Deja Vu, Every time i see u
You should come closer, so i can reach over to give u my number
Uh huh

First off let's keep it real and talk about how, you couldn't acknowledge me but u love my style
Is it my clothes, is my kicks, is it my hair , life was unfair , i was far from rich! You can't say that
You're real when you ain't been through shit, i been gave up on love
I can't deal with this, I'm just wasting my time with these lunatics, cut the foolishness and let me grab on your hips, sit back relax and watch romantic flicks, all i ever wanted was companionship, you played your role and i played the script, this love is titanic I can't abandon ship!
