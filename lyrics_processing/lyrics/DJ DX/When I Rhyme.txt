Dear America
I can't take it no more
Kids is dying
Now a days
Right beside the stores
I grew up in the hood
To be an entrepreneur
But I'm suffering in life
I got to sleep
On these floors
Obama don't care
You know this world
Is in fear!
I guess this was planned
Before Edith met Grafar!
I'm a man not a hoodlum
Let's set the record straight
Before i regulate
I need to meditate
Let my soul levitate
I wanna speak to GOD
I can see the light
But he won't speak to rob
Damn look at my job
I barely have work
And grandpa keep calling me
He's irking my nerves!
But i love you
And respect you for what u do
If i was to lose you
I don't know what i would do
I lost my daddy and my nanny
I wish they live to see me make it
But I'm stuck in this basement still
I don't know why ?!
Got away from selling drugs
And doing crimes
I left in the pass and put it
All behind
This is pain from the heart
And thoughts from the mind
I walked
Many miles but I'm still
On my grind

Something like Ali
In his prime

Before secret societies
We all lived in poverty
Fuck the Illuminati
And this whole economy
Forget the hypocrisy
The government is watching me
Show some comradery
I'm the lords prophecy
You knocked down
My buildings
Then took my children
Then put me on support
Why you hurt my feelings ?
I thought it was love ?
Until i learned it was lust
And come to find out
You fucked me for bucks ?
But u couldn't pay your rent
And you was backed up
For months!
You went from smelling like weed
To Angel Dust!
What the fuck is going on
In this world that we live in?
It's either Jail or Prisons
Or locked behind a solid wall!
But i rather write my life
Into these songs, I was
Raised a foul way
But i still love my moms
We been through the pain
But the saga must continue
I remember when i couldn't
By food off the menu

Look at my hood
Can't you tell that
It's broke down
Kids get clapped down
And the cops don't
Come around!
I'm still on solid ground
Through all this pain
It's just so fucked up
How Michael got slain ed
I'm Jesus Shuttlesworth
To this whole Rap Game
I got these industry
Execs now calling my name
Haters knocking my fame
Cuz they can't sell why ?
Lesson one lames, learn how
To strategize , a bunch of
Tuff guys tried to rob
Me in my hallway, 2 shots
Went off, that's for stealing
My cocaine! I was born gangster
My pops did time in rah way
I grew up with anger
I've been the same since fourteen
I got down with Yahweh
To get these demons off me
People that crossed me
Is definitely lost ed
Putting hits in the vault
Please listen to my thoughts
I might be from Jerz, but
I'm the talk of New York!
