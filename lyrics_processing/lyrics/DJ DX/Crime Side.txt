Real recognize real
I miss my son and my daughter
I never thought my baby
Mother would be addicted
To water,a quarter half
Of my life done passed
I've been through torture
Many days have passed when
I sipped on Johnnie Walker
Stalkers they call me block *67
Silence on the phone, Okay
I get the message! In reference
To them offers that came i had declined
Cuz' it doesn't fulfill what i feel inside
I saw my best friend my die, he was shot
Five times, left in a pool a blood
A real hate crime! Street Gangs
And signs that i don't respect
And we put each other down on the Internet
Where's your intellect ? Build your self esteem
We all want dollars but liquid is cream
Don't believe the truth ? Just ask a feen
He's probably sitting in a alley
Putting dope in his Genes" -

I'm Closer to my dreams
But it seems it not real!
No deals, no vids' (videos) , but don't
Blame it on whiz! Look handle
Your biz, Dog, I know u got kids
I only came to you, cuz' of the life
That i live. I even hustled where i lived
And seen feens get shot!
But Hoe Lover held it down when my ass got
Knocked (Arrested in Jail)
I keep hearing around the world
That I'm the next Tupac
But difference is man, I ain't never get shot
Never snitched on my friends
I don't talk to cops, the same brothers that robbed me
Got killed on my block!!!
For an even exchange they put the FEDS
On the drop, I saw RICO get knocked
I seen ITO get knocked
Death before dishonor, lyrics before a dollar
The world needs change but i can't trust OBAMA!
95% percent of these rap critics is cowards
Blessed by the GODS, my Talent is hard to acknowledge -
