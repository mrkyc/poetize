Let's Get it On

This is my talent
My tone is not silent
I grew up
In the streets
Busting heat and
Dealing narcotics
I'm not a rapper
I'm a artist
You"re painting
This image retarded!
Don't get me started
I'm feeling open hearted
Like Giotto or Leonardo
But I'm gangster like Pablo
And i paint like Picasso
Ass hole
Die slow like Castro
I got a Blondie
In my condo
She takes off my bathrobe
And that's all you should know!
Before i went pro
I had the sickest flow
From my hood
But misunderstood
Cuz haters can't
Interpret my plans
I know I'm the man
And I'm here to take
Over this land
It's Hip Hop not POP
Majors please understand
Before i thought about
An album or a single
I knew the music
Had to be lethal
I'm just tryna
Reach to the people
I'm a young black poet
Trying to take over
Showbiz
And when I'm done
I guarantee
The whole globe, will know it -

Like Michael
I'm viral
Fuck a title
I son my rivals
And turn there momma
Suicidal
Dead on arrival
Madden cut up the vinyl
Let's go to Cairo
And get a Gyro
That's word
To the bible
And the Quran
This mission we on
Wasn't impossible
We beat the odds
Now we shall meet with God
It's so logical
We came out the Earth
Like fossil fuels
When i die
I hope NY
Don't smoke my
