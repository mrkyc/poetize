Look at me now
I'm proud
I've done made it off
The ground
I remember living in the PJ's
When i ain't crack a smile
NY always put me down
Yea i beat the trial
Shout out to Stan krouse
God blessed his child
I just put it in words
I did it all for Jerz
Selling cocaine and marijuana
Right off the curbs
From Hudson county all the way
To the burbs
I'm a hustler boys and girls
Just look and observe
I'm from the streets
When most get buried
And put to sleep
It's hard to breathe
When you got to deal with fatigue
But physically i don't show no
Wear or no tear
This is pain from the years
And I'm still on the snare
Momma named me belaire
Poppa name was Grafar
If you wasn't with me
When i was broke then
Get the fuck outta here!
Just pass me the chair
And please step away
From the throne
Jersey's my home
So stop acting like
You don't know
You might also like
When i was locked
Down behind bars
You always told me
I'll be waiting for you
When I was
Tricking living
A double life
You always told me
I'll be waiting for you
When I was
Stressed out
And homeless
You always told me
I'll be waiting for you
When times
Was hard and
I didn't have
No job
You always told me
I'll be waiting for you

If you
Waiting for me
Then I've been
Waiting for you
Cuz I've been fighting
All my life
Like a pay per view
I paid my dues
To fools that had me mi's confused
It mystical
How i flow in ritual
So lyrical
Thank Yahway it's a miracle
I'm here with God
Saint Michael done
Destroyed Satan!
I'm not pagan
But i spit fire
With priors
Criminal minded
Addicted to violence
And sirens until
I changed!
I've been through
Hell of pain
And I'm not going back!
I"ve been locked behind bars
That life was whack
In the trap
Rest in peace the feens
I'm from the 201
City of broken dreams
You know what
I mean
14B is the exit
Where junkies is
Anorexic
Paramedics and stretchers
Carry the bodies away
Niggers know that I'm made
I'm giving back
Cuz I'm paid
And I'm the don like the John Gotti
Of today

When i was locked
Down behind bars
You always told me
I'll be waiting for you
When I was
Tricking living
A double life
You always told me
I'll be waiting for you
When I was
Stressed out
And homeless
You always told me
I'll be waiting for you
When times
Was hard and
I didn't have
No job
You always told me
