The radio is shook
There scared
To take a look
At new talent
I guess now a days
It's all about payola
DJ's getting paid
To work like a slave
This game
Done turned there interest
To pop fame, we don't
Drop names
We entertain for the culture
From Russia to Nova Scotia
I've done told ya
I'm Americas product
Cut the Gossip
I'm Robert I don't need no bloggers
My life is a movie
I know that God is watching
My city doubted me
Like coach Tom Coughlin
Paul Bearer, please open
Up the coffin
First tour was New York
Next stop is Boston
Hip hop use to be Hard
Why the hell did it soften ?
My cousins barely called me
Now they visit me often
Kingpin of the streets
I'm in every body's
Walkman
Laptops, Ipods
I'm what the world
Is talking about
Flows and delivery
Hood to hood feel me!

I got something
For the radio
Like Biz Markie
But the FCC
Won't even spin
My songs for free
The Illuminati
Want my body
Cuz I'm connected
To heaven
And Angela Yee
Why you won't
Respond to my messages?
It's evident
That I'm Methodist
I was birthed
And blessed with this
A specialist
To Hip Hop
Rock-n-Rolling
Like Kid Rock
I been hot
So respect
The brand
And the name
And what is this
Funk flex arguing
With Charlemagne?
Well buckle up
Cuz Jerz ain't
Had a hit since
Pump it up! 22 counties
Locked down
In the first 6 months
Open your trunks
My CD is straight
For the streets!
I don't need the press
I just let
The music speak
I had a dream
I went platinum
In Germany
Can't forget the fans
Upstate in Albany
So America please
Learn to love
Your own cuz
I'm taking over
The waves like Howard Stern
Uh huh
