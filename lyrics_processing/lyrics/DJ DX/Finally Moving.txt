This is the feeling
That i get when i start rapping
Jump on the stage
Flick a page in my brain
Then begin to entertain
I'm still in shame
Before fame came I was on the block
Selling rock to undercover cops
In that 2 door drop
Until they shut down shop
This is rob not the DJ or MC
From JC where most people envy
Gotta thank Dirty and my aunt penny
Long nights up drinking henny
Stressed out over Wendy
Pretty, Dominican dime
That will play with your mind
And mess up your grind
Not me MA!
I'm in my prime tryn"a shine
And lead the whole globe
Line for line , Get it ?
Or get lost! of course
I'm finally moving with the powerful
Force of the Lord, so respect my laws
I took losses and offers from bosses
They know live in coffins, come on
Let's get to the chorus
You might also like
Through the bad
And the good
And the ups and Downs
From Ghetto to Ghetto
I can solemnly say
I'm Finally Moving
East coast west coast
World wide
I'm Finally Moving...
East Coast west coast
Worldwide
Through the bad
And the good
And the ups and downs
From Ghetto to Ghetto
I can solemnly say
I'm Finally Moving...
East coast west coast
World wide
I'm Finally Moving
East Coast west coast

To my daughter
Rai-Yania
And my son
Niveon when I'm gone
I hope you praise
My name in vain
And play all of my songs
Don't do wrong
And avoid the storm
If you need guidance
Hit up your uncle kaquan
Or Keith they know the streets
And difference between
Peace and beef
But that ain't y'all
Y'all were blessed by God
You both were birthed
In this world
Through the struggles
Of ROB!, sing along
