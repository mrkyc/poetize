All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it

It's the dream of my life to speak on this mic
And through the whirlpool, I can talk to Christ
Right or wrong? I made hit songs
I was born to preform with an artofon
Through the shining light and that umbilical cord
An angel appeared and kept me warm
But my sister left and ever since then
I've been so depressed
That's why I never settle for less
I work hard and pray to God each and everyday
I'm blessed in so many ways, yeah
I get to see another day
But wait, is it fate or fortune?
I got to be cautious, hopping out off them Porsches
Everything that glitz definitely ain't glamour
I learned this little secret from my Grandma
(That's how you sang it)
Rest In Peace, I know you're with Nanna

All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it
You might also like
I gave you everything in this beautiful world
Momma told me, never ever trust no girl
I gave you pearls and I gave you money
Shopping sprees all across the country
Now I'm in the hood, broke and hungry
Rest in Peace, I just Lost my homie
Don't you call me ever again
For living a lie, now you lost a friend
Through this pen and this booth
I free my sins when I release the truth
Heaven on Earth, I'll see you soon
I look at the Moon cause my life is doomed
Stay tuned and thank you
Your mother should've named you Ungrateful
Look at the good that God gave you
(That's how you sang it)
You fucked it up as days grew

All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it
I solemnly swear on this beat
I gave everything up in these streets
Just so we can live and have some peace
I keep in memory just for the deceased
I would scream but don't take it there
You cheated on me and had an affair
Love is blind, that shit ain't clear
Trial after trial, but I'm still here
Feels like I'm crippled in a wheelchair
Propelled still to be a millionaire
What up Madden, what up Wiz
When I'm gone, just know I cared
I showed the world love but they treated me weird
I guess that's how it is when God is near
(That's how you sang it)

All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
