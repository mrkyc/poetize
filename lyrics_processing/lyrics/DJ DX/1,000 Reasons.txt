And I can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you, I don't believe in you and I
And I can think of a thousand reasons why
The reasons why
I don't believe in you
I don't believe
I don't believe in you and I
Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth
You're the only one that wants me around
Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth
You're the only one that wants me to die

I had enough of love
And I'm done with all
I'm not scrub I'm a thug
Man we all have faults
When you was tricking
On the late night, living
A triple life, ignoring my calls
And avoiding my texts, You knew
Right from wrong, you learned
That shit from your mom! Word is born
You did me trife, now it's time to move on
My next woman will be my wife, i put that on Christ
What you and me had was lust, it never was trust!
But you checked into the clinic cuz the condom busted
But we smashed in the magnum in the back of the truck
We went from havenots, we now living it up, You let the money
Change u, you stop giving a fuck! I was in the streets, You was
A full time nurse, catching case after case, then my life got worse
I gave up on love and put this rap shit first, madden bring the chorus in she already heard the verse, come on -

Maybe i wasn't a man, or maybe i wasn't good
Baby you were to basic, i was misunderstood
I'm from the hood, where men don't rely on women
Remember,  i was dead broke, i couldn't feed  my children
You wouldn't listen, i guess u needed so much attention
That you couldn't come to Jersey, and u missed every visit
But I'm living, i keep an image on my wall, you got me thinking out loud, dam, how could we fall ? But i loved you and respected you, It hurt me when i left you, when them other guys texted you, Yea that was disrespectful, we fought over phones, then we fought over loans, but when them feelings hit, you just wanted to be alone, so, u left me in the cold but I'm warm again, I forgave you for each and every one of your sins, You might have betrayed me, but I'm still your friend, Good bye, so long, until we meet again, so long
