Check the new style
My flow is versatile
Sub zero or scorpion
I'm spitting like reptiles
I'm shutting this game down
You heard it verse for verse
Because the flow is so sick
You are going to need a nurse
Put my name in a song
Your girl pull off her thong
I whip my pipe out
She said my penis is too long
I got her hooked to sex
Like it's methadone
I'm one of the hottest emcees
On this microphone
Spitting rounds on these clowns
Like im Al Capone
Jersey City, New Jersey
Is the danger zone
Came out of Kearny
And met madden my first day home
In this music business because
Def Jam been deaf
Ever since Russell Simmons
I want the women
The world and everything in it
I feel timid by the minute
Don't ask how we did it
But like biggie said
You know the sky's the limit

Ninja of rap, the boss is back

I want one million unaccounted
Just for my children
Because a nigga stack more bricks
Than project buildings
What am i feeling? (preach)
Man im deep in my feelings
Blood stains on the wall
Dam look at the ceiling
Hip-hop became soft
So i became a villain
Cut from a different cloth
I might be sicilian
Just hold on Ra-Iyania
I am about to sign for millions
If i should die don't cry
Take care of all your siblings
I know you grew up in the projects
Seeing hallway dealings
Hallway killings, now flip
The money to billions
I got bars for days like a correctional felon
We started from the bottom
Now the fans is yelling
I bought so many jays
That they think i'm re selling
And i'm never off beat
Who the heck are you telling
Cannabis for men so you know how i'm smelling
Bouncers wanna pat us down
But we still bring the L in

Ninja of rap, the boss is back

I murder the beat
Man I murder the flow
People screaming our name
Everywhere that we go
We got jerz on lock for fiver years in a row
And even Johnny Depp know
Man we're about to blow
400k sold man we next to gold
I'll bring terror to your squad like
Pun and Fat Joe
Shout to white wisdom
She's across the globe
So sit back and relax it's the yahway show
