Man, I'm still parking lot pimpin' (pimpin')
Been addicted to music
Since i was an infant
I got to thank my momma
And poppa for the blues
If it wasn't for them
I wouldn't know what to choose
Done lost a few off of that gangsta lean
Look how many bloods and crips
Wanted to bang on me
Because i'm major league and independent son
Don't get it twisted young
I'm from the 201
Sinatra use to sing here
They still call it the slums
Out in Camden they can't call 911
Bums asking for change
People acting all strange
These events wouldn't occurred
If we lived back in the days
Before the term turned up
It was hip-hop hooray
My people stop the violence
Bow your heads and pray
You might also like
Yes yes yall
And you don't stop
To the beat y'all
And you don't stop
Yes yes yall
And you don't stop
One two yall
And you don't stop
Yes yes yall
And you don't stop
To the beat y'all
And you don't stop
Yes yes yall
And you don't stop
One two yall
And you don't stop

Look we all struggle
So we hustle (hustle)
It's the only way to make it
Out the jungle
Coming up in jerz
I use to hustle on curbs
I've done lost a lot of friends
So i'm lost for words
And the only way to speak
Is on these hip-hop beats
Calling me a fraud dog
Homie that ain't me
I survived 7 years down in btp
It's been rip since meety streets
Whoever murdered him
I hope they living six feet deep
I got back against the wall
Spitting sweet 16's
So follow your dreams
And conquer the world
Racist remarks shouldn't
Stop us at all
Take a look at Donald Sterling
He was destined to fall
I'm young black and proud
And i support the poor
Yes yes yall
And you don't stop
To the beat y'all
And you don't stop
Yes yes yall
And you don't stop
One two yall
