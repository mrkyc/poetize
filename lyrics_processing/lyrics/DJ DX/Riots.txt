Nah nah baby, this ain't living

Yo
You can't tell me I'm hip
You can't tell me I'm hop
People dying everyday, they getting
Killed on they blocks,You got blacks
In the streets that like to stand and watch
While another black man gets recorded and shot
Show no love for these pigs cuz we hate
Crooked cops, this whole thing that you seeing
Was predicted by PAC, we tired of banging on these
Doors, it's time to break these locks, so the system
Can't blame us for not having a lot, Y'all done
Corrupted our culture and everything we created, then y'all
Sit back and laugh at black entertainment, sick of being famous
I just wanna meet Jesus, cuz down here on earth there's no more
Black leaders, just a bunch of fake preachers and a whole lot of deceivers
It's time to say peace like the poor righteous teachers, lord show some grievance
For this revolution war, is blacks and puerto ricans down for the same cause!

This ain't about race so forget
The competition, we live in a world
With corrupted politicians, look at
The way we living, we all playing the victim
Its time to unite, lets go against the system
Cuz killing one another won't help us raise our children
If morals brought money, then we all would have millions
We are all civilians just living in the ghetto
Its either sell drugs, grip the chrome, bust the metal
It took Freddie to die for y'all to do something
When Trayvon died man y'all ain't do nothing, Eye for an eye
So let's kill that man, If you don't have an idea then its
George Zimmerman, and fuck the white house, Obama's the middleman He never brought change all he did was bring pain, Hilary up next, This shit is just a game, but all this anger made the people go insane!

Heart of a lion, the eye of a panther
Why is blacks in the streets, dying
Quicker than cancer? This black on black crime
Is not the answer, They killed Mike Brown
He even had his hands up! They choked Eric Garner
He was cuffed in handcuffs, They popped Jordan Davis
He was parked in a red truck, They killed Rekia Boyd
Where there were no cameras, They shot Oscar Grant, so
It's time to stand up, No! Listen, forget the food and stamps
All we want is justice and freedom on the land, so fuck the police
And the Klu Klux Klan, The gangs came together just for the black man
Dam, you see we suffering in poverty, all you do is lie and fuck up
The economy, but where is the equality for all nationalities? But you call us thugs for looting and rioting!
