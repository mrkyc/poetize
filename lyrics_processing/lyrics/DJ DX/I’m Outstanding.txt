I'm Outstanding
Wherever I go
I'm Outstanding
When ever I Flow
I'm Outstanding
Y'all Should Know
I'm one of the Illest
To do this
On this Microphone

Listen
And pay attention
I'm here to lead
My whole generation
Into the next dimension
And this ain't
About religion but
Respect my culture!
Lord please forgive me
For my days being awful
Now I'm so flawless
In how i write
Through this mic
Is where I'm able
To speak to Christ
All my life
In this streets
Serving cocaine
And marijuana
And i had an obsession
About Quana
I guess i was addicted
To the drama
Got away from the problem
To see another hour
Cuz tomorrow
Is not promised!
Many soldiers
From my country
Got killed because
Of power
In the end it all reflects
On president Obama
Tryn"a make a million
Off a dollar
Raping knowledge
And scholars you coward
Stop treating
The people like garbage
You heard it
From a prophet
Last name Van Liew
I shall never lie
When i step in the booth
So y'all can go get
Who you want
As a leader
But I'm a keep on preaching
Right through these speakers
Hit after hit
Track after track
I'm a be the first
Rapper to put rap
Back on the map

Wherever I go
I'm Outstanding
When ever I Flow
I'm Outstanding
Y'all Should Know
I'm one of the Illest
To do this
On this Microphone

The Government
Focusing on me
Through a microscope
So i pray to God
Each and every day
And ask for hope
And ask for change
Please wash away
The pain
From the homeless
On the streets
Sleeping with no heat
The wealthy don't care
Because there all
Controlled by the beast
They got the marking
On there flesh
Scanned by DST
Not me I'm not weak
I got my mind
Occupied on one thing
And that's wall street
Please listen to me
We are all anonymous
Under one an abolishment
Snatched for scholarships
To fight in a war
Where lives are mourned
While big brother
Just sits and applauds
Like he's court side
Watching basketball ?
I'm Outstanding
Wherever I go
I'm Outstanding
When ever I Flow
I'm Outstanding
Y'all Should Know
I'm one of the Illest
To do this
