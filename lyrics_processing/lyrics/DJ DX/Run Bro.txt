Run Bro
Your momma's crying again
Run Bro
I don't want your life to end
Run Bro, Run Bro
As fast as you can
Run Bro the man got a gun in his hand
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way

Blaow this is the sound of America now
You're probably hearing gunshots
Echo through your town
While the rich is getting richer and getting
Aroused, young men are getting deployed
Or getting gunned down, I'd rather hear
A violin than hear a siren
Fox news is a big joke all they promote is violence
Rest in peace to all the people that passed away
The NRA is the cause for these guns that spray

Ain't your momma done told ya
Ain't she done scold ya and scold ya
Ain't she told you before bro
When the cops come you run bro
You might also likeWhen they put me before the sarge
I will deny the charge
When they ask me
How i plead
Not guilty judge most decidedly
You can tell judge at the glance
I'm just a victim of circumstance

Run Bro
Run Bro
Run Bro
Run Bro, Ooooh
These police be catching, Ooooh
Bro run too slow
Run Bro
Your momma's crying again
Run Bro
I don't want your life to end
Run Bro, Run Bro
As fast as you can
Run Bro the man got a gun in his hand
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
Now they think my voice is the lead
Of a movement for all the people that's lost
And acting foolish, CNN won't dare to
Televise this revolution, confusion is just a
Tactic to change a law, they lock us down
And wonder why we don't get along
A different psalm man a different scripture
Racism in all races but you beg to differ when
My president is nothing different than Adolf Hitler
My ninja 6 million ways to die you choose one
The first way to kill your hood without a gun
Pollute the water take men away from their daughters
You can build a wall but we still gonna cross the border
No love in this world compares to a Gemini and a Taurus
Kaepernick took the kneel but is Nike really for us
I come from America the land of the rich and poorest
But babies in Flint, Michigan is drinking lead in their water

Run Bro
Your momma's crying again
Run Bro
I don't want your life to end
Run Bro, Run Bro
As fast as you can
Run Bro the man got a gun in his hand
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
Wow we in the Age of Aquarius
I'm curious cause everything is getting
Serious
This year all alone many people lost their homes
Fires out in Cali
The valley is holding on
Government inequality affecting people in poverty
The lack of opportunity paying debt is just robbery but
Honestly i'm just trying to live in sovereignty but all i see
Is white cops trying to do harm to me but solemnly
The senate just made lynching a crime
Just this year a man was killed
They called it suicide
How you shoot two men but feel good inside
Is the bible the truth or rewritten lines
Reparations been due we at the end of times
No conspiracy theorist
I'm just speaking my mind
Meanwhile the Rothschilds are creating wars
And they profit off of your straw as soon as you're born

Run Bro
Your momma's crying again
Run Bro
I don't want your life to end
Run Bro, Run Bro
As fast as you can
Run Bro the man got a gun in his hand
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
