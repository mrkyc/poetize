Look ladies
And gentlemen I'm here
With my middlemen
And we trying to make a plot
To take over Switzerland
The people call me frank
Cuz i am all about
My Benjamin's
Tickets to the Wimbledon
Just to watch Venus
These white women
Next to me
Know I'm some type of genius
I'm a worldwide wonder
I was touched by the Incas
I can fly back and forth
From Mexico to Lima
With this type of luxury
It'll make you catch seizures
I use to have a high top
Now I'm rocking a Cesar
I use to play on Belmont
Now I'm played in Ibiza
And i don't need a feature
I'm the leader of my own genre
I'll throw you in the sea
Like Obama did to Osama
Cuz most men think they're
Gonna jerk me for a dollar
Until they wake up and see
That there hooked up in trauma
With a suction pump flushing
Out there guts
And there mother and there father
Wiping off there saliva
You might also like
Boom clap
I'm back on the snare
I can smell 2012
In the air
It's my year, I'm here to take over
I'm Hip hop's makeover
Call up Jay Hova
And tell em I'm next
I'm the best, i belong in the hall
But the only thing
That's missing when i walk through
Is my name on the wall
Sick of turning on the dial
Its just the same ol songs
Same ol schemes, same ol beats
But this is suppose to be the artist
That's better than me ?! sheesh
I'm not with it, and just for the record
None of these niggers is gifted
So listen, cut the auto tune and the chopped
And screwed! Cuz my generation is so tired
Of being confused, most rappers sell their souls
To a deal that screwed, me I'm an Emcee,!
Above all rafters, i got the game on lock
