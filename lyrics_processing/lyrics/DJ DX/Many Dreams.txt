The same people to dis me
Now begging to do a song
It's not my fault
I smartened up
And started writing my wrongs
I had a lot of problems
Now my problems is solved
I remember growing up
And getting beat by moms
My pops wasn't there
He was locked in a box
I was eighteen years old
Getting chased by the cops
Its hard ducking the Narcs
When you move a lot of Rock!
But the code of the streets
Is don't hustle when it's dark
Murder scenes and yellow tape
Nightmares that you can't escape
Dead man that you can't awake
Rest In peace, his soul is safe!
A lot of cats that i lost
In this life time
Would've wished and prayed
Just to live nine lives

DO not miss your chance to blow
Many Dreams is what I had

The same people to put me down
Gonna need me later
They're coming at me with knives
But i still cut on the fad er
This is my chance to blow
Because i want something greater
I wanna travel the world
All across the equator
Blessed by the creator
But been through so much pain
These 23$ dollar checks
Got me going insane
What am i living for ?
Just to feel this pain ?
And we pray everyday
But we don't see no change
Look at the economy !
It's all poverty!
Barack Obama owe the world
An apology!!!!
How could you lie to me ?
It's criminology
I guess American can't tell
Because there too blind to see!
Many Dreams is what i had
DO not miss your chance to blow
Many Dreams is what I had
DO not miss your chance to blow
Many Dreams is what I had
DO not miss your chance to blow
Many Dreams is what I had

Since New York fell off
Then the south took over
Can't go back to the hood
To look over my shoulders
I got mouths to feed
Before I'm R.I.P'd
Love and success
Is really all i need
We up day and night
Just to reach our dreams
Everyday is a fight
I feel like Prince Naseem
Another Day in the Life
Just to make ends meet
I go hard on these streets
And flow hard on these beats
Platinum worldwide baby
That's all me!
Best Rapper Alive
Trying to sell Lp's
We came up from the bottom
By all means
More money more problems
It was ruff as a teen!
Many Dreams is what i had
DO not miss your chance to blow
Many Dreams is what I had
DO not miss your chance to blow
Many Dreams is what I had
DO not miss your chance to blow
Many Dreams is what I had
