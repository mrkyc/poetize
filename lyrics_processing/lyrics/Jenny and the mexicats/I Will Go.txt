You caught me peeking out beneath my hair
Dancing without us touching
A dream of a heartless love affair
Do you hear it
Do you feel it there
We are creating chemicals from the air
In between the silver and the gold
We are as wild as they've all be told
I will go, I will go, I will go, go, go out
Go out with the speed of light
My feet will tiptoe lightly
And I will do it right
I will go, I will go, I will go, go, go out
Go out with the speed of light
My feet will tiptoe lightly
And I will do it right
Here no one else can see me
I float across the room to your chair
Tasting without debating
The consequences gliding up the stairs
You might also likeDo you hear it
Do you feel it there
We are creating chemicals from the air
In between the silver and the gold
We are as wild as they've all be told
I will go, I will go, I will go, go, go out
Go out with the speed of light
My feet will tiptoe lightly
And I will do it right
I will go, I will go, I will go, go, go out
Go out with the speed of light
My feet will tiptoe lightly
And I will do it right
Dancing, dancing without us touching
And you know, and you know, I will go, and you know
I will go, I will go, I will go, go, go out
Go out with the speed of light
My feet will tiptoe lightly
And I will do it right
I will go, I will go, I will go, go, go out
Go out with the speed of light
My feet will tiptoe lightly
