One foot in front of the other
I like to think things will all work out fine
And follow along behind those
One act play-things can give you a thrill
Guess it depends on the actor
Dreams can come true, but some things never will
As a matter of fact, those things are driving me crazy
Those things are keeping me sane
I like to take things and make a design
Keep a low profile. Oh and
I like to take things and put them to rhyme
Like those things that are confusing
You might also likeAnd the things that seem so clear
And the things that seem so far away
And yet they seem so near
There are some things I have lost
And a few things I have found
Weel it's so hard to keep track of things
There's so many around
There's so many around
And there's things we have to look for
And a few we never find
And we all have things in common
You got your thing, I've got mine
And some things they just happen
And some things you can plan
And some of those things you just can't help
But some of them you can
Oh, some of them you can
As a matter of fact, those things
Are driving me crazy
Those things are keeping me sane
Some things turn out all wrong
And some things turn out all right
Some things don't turn out at all
But then again they might
There are things that come too soon
And some things that come too late
It's the best thing to come too early
So you have some time to wait
Oh, have some time to wait
Well it's hard to talk with words
There's some things you just can't say
And it's best to leave some things alone
In case they go away
You can share some things with friends
There's some things we've all been thru'
Well it's things like this and things like that
And how are things with you?
Oh, how do you do?
You can hang things on your wall
You can leave your things around
You can mark some things 2001, and put them in the ground
And maybe later on, they will dig them up some day
And ooh and ahh, and 'how 'bout that?'
