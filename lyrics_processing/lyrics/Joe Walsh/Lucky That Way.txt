But you might know my name to some degree
Sometimes I can't believe that I'm still standing
And it feels pretty good to be me
I get to live out here in California
I got a palm tree and a swimming pool
Have some fun and try to play my music
Was all I really said I could do
And if anybody asks me - Joe how do you do it
'Cause you do it with such style and grace
I just shake my head and smile
Look 'em in the eyes and say
I'm just lucky that way... just lucky
Got a good woman and she makes me happy
Most of the time I make her happy too
We decided we should live together
So we both said 'I do'
And when someone says - Hey Joe, I saw you on TV
And how do you know what to play
I just shake my head and smile
Look 'em in the eyes and say
I'm just lucky that way
You might also likeStarted in the middle of nowhere
I didn't have far to fall
There were times I thought it was the end of the world
It didn't turn out so bad after all
Yeah, I started in the middle of nowhere
I didn't have far to fall
And the times I thought it was the end of the world
Didn't turn out so bad after all
I'll let you all in on a little secret
If I could share with you a thing or two
If you just act like you know what you're doing
Everybody thinks that you do
And when anybody asks me - Joe, how do you do it
'Cause you do it with such style and grace
I just shake my head and smile
Look 'em in the eyes and say -
I'm just lucky, I'm just lucky
I'm just lucky that way
