Every time you opened your mouth it was my voice that I heard
At least that's what I thought, or maybe I'm just lonely
Believing every minute of every day, that you're the very only
You led me on 'cause all your songs, were stuck onto my heart
Why don't you finish what you start?
People wishing I'd come back
I don't wanna' change like that
People crying for old days
I don't wanna' change that way
Before, you had to sing your songs, there was nothing else you could do
Well, I know all about it, 'cause I do it too
I waited and waited and waited and waited for you to return again
And when you finally resurfaced, it was like I'd lost my best friend
You led me on 'cause all your songs, were really dear to me. Ohhh!
I wish your words were still clear to me
People wishing I'd come back
I don't wanna' change like that
People crying for old days
I don't wanna' change that way. No
You might also likeIt's a fact and I can't fight it, it will always be unrequited
If I had a bullet, I would bite it
If you didn't mean it, why'd you write it? It will always be unrequited
If I had a bullet, I would bite it
You can't come back that many times, there's no such thing as a dull roar
I promise I'll never make you wish it was like it was before
I'll stop it before it gets like that, it doesn't matter how
You'll only have good memories, the only time is now
People wishing I'd come back
I don't wanna' change like that
People crying for old days
I don't wanna' change that way
People wishing I'd come back
I don't wanna' do that
People crying for old days
