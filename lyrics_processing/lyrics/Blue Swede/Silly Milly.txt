Singing silly songs
I'm lying awake
Your voice makes me shake
Singing songs I can stand more
The shower runs dry
But I don't know why
You're still singing like mad
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
My love is still strong but maybe
Silly Milly, if you're still trying
To send my hair flying
You're losing a friend
How can I explain
I'm trying in vain
To get used to her simple songs
But she does not care
And I cannot bear
That she's driving me mad
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
My love is still strong but maybe
Silly Milly, if you're still trying
To send my hair flying
You're losing a friend
You might also likeBaby, tell me have you
Gone out of your head
Come on, Silly Milly, come on
Milly, can't you see that
You're making me feel bad
Come on, silly, silly, silly
Silly, Silly, silly
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
My love is still strong but maybe
Silly Milly, if you're still trying
To send my hair flying
You're losing a friend
Silly Milly, if you're still trying
To send my hair flying
You're losing a friend
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
My love is still strong but maybe
Silly Milly, if you're still trying
To send my hair flying
You're losing a friend
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
My love is still strong but maybe
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
My love is still strong but maybe
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
My love is still strong but maybe
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
