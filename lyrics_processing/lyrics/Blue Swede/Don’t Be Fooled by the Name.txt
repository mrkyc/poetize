Baby, I heard the bad news
That you found another man
I must admit I'm not surprised
That you're doin' it again
He's a guy who hit the big time
Among high society
But here's some piece of good advice
And baby, it's for free

Don't be fooled by the name (No, no, no, no, no)
Remember you can't judge a book by the cover
Or a painting by the frame

Don't be fooled by the name (No, no, no, no)
You got to look deeper inside
You got to find things that are hidin'
Stop, look, and listen to your mind (Na na na na na na na nind)

If you believe in fairy tales
You better go along
And join the mindset followed up by
Piper's magic song
You might also likeHis lovin' kind of music
May fit but seriously
Now here's some piece of good advice
And baby, it's on me

Don't be fooled by the name (No, no, no, no)
Remember you can't judge a book by the cover
Or a painting by the frame

Don't be fooled by the name (No, no, no, no, no)
You got to look deeper inside
You got to find things that are hidin'
Stop, look, and listen to your mind (Na na na na na nin nind)

Don't be fooled by the name (No, no, no, no)
Remember you can't judge a book by the cover
Or a painting by the frame

Don't be fooled by the name (No, no, no, no, no)
You got to look deeper inside
You got to find things that are hidin'
Stop, look, and listen to your mind (Na na ind)
Don't be fooled by the name (No, no, no)
Remember you can't judge a book by the cover
Or a painting by the frame

Don't be fooled by the name (No)
You got to look deeper inside
You got to find things that are hidin'
Stop, look, and listen to your mind (Na na nind)

Don't be fooled by the name (No, no)
Remember you can't judge a book by the cover
Or a painting by the frame

Don't be fooled by the name (No)
Remember you can't judge a book by the cover
Or a painting by the frame

Don't be fooled by the name (Don't be fooled by the name)
Remember you can't judge a book by the cover
