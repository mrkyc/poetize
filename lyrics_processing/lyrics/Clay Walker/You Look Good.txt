Girl, you could pull off big city
Top shelf, high class pretty
You got that style, so classic
And everybody knows you have it
You've got a Hollywood smile, but a heart like Texas
But I'll never figure out just what you look best in

You look good in the middle of a little farm town
Good on my bench seat riding 'round
Look good in nothing, good in my shirt
Right now you're looking so good it hurts
Look good climbing up holding on to my John Deer
Kicking back in my lap with a cold beer
No secret everyone around here can see
I look good with you, you look good with me

You got that thing about you
Turns every head around you
And I don't know if you know it
'Cause if you do, girl you sure don't show it
And I keep falling more in love
And it ain't just because

And girl, you look good with me
You look good, you look good
