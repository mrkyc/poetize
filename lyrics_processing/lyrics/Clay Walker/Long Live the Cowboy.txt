Long live the cowboy
Long live the cowboy

Mendin' a fence in Oklahoma
Rollin' like a tumbleweed in Tulsa
Holdin' on for the dough in the rodeo
Somewhere in San Antone
All the way up in Nebraska
Sittin' on a tractor out in Colorado
Roundin' up cattle, lightin' that lucky strike
And burnin' it red while the sun goes down

Long live the cowboy rockin' them trucks
Never gettin' stuck in the mud
I'm talkin' about American made
Nothing but USA, dirt runnin' through his veins
You know him as the man in black bustin' his ass
In the boots and the buckle and the hat
Come on, make some noise
For the one and only real McCoy's
Long live the cowboys

Pullin' a midnight haul through Arkansas
Ropin' the wind in Wichita
Tossin' that pigskin, tryna get a win
Down in the Big D
All the way out in the Gulf of Mexico
Drillin' that hole, pumpin' black gold
Calloused up hands, spittin' in the can
Probably be a God-fearin' man

Long live the cowboy rockin' them trucks
Never gettin' stuck in the mud
I'm talkin' about American made
Nothing but USA, dirt runnin' through his veins
You know him as the man in black bustin' his ass
In the boots and the buckle and the hat
Come on, make some noise
For the one and only real McCoy's
Long live the cowboy, giddy-up!

John Wayne, Jesse James
"Amarillo by Morning," George Strait
Wild Bill, Will Rogers too
Marlboro Man and Chris LeDoux
And anybody wearin' them boots
Long live the cowboy

Long live the cowboy rockin' them trucks
Never gettin' stuck in the mud
I'm talkin' about American made
Nothing but USA, dirt runnin' through his veins
You know him as the man in black bustin' his ass
In the boots and the buckle and the hat
Come on, make some noise
For the one and only real McCoy's
Long live the cowboy
