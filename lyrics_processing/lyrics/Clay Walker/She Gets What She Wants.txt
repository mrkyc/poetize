She wants the moon, I get a rope
And pull it closer to her window
If she wants a skyline, I give her New York
If she wants Paris, I get a passport
If she wants some wine in California
I get in my car and I drive her all the way there
I don't care, any time, anything, anywhere

All she's gotta do is ask me, ask me
And bat those lashes and look at me, look at me
One little kiss is enough to convince me
Y'all, she gets what she wants
Around her finger, she wraps me, wraps me
And all I wanna do is make her happy
It's always an "oh hell yeah" when she turns it on
Yeah, she gets what she wants

A little wink, a little smile
She wants an inch, she gets a mile
I come a-runnin' when she calls
Is she worth it? Yes, she's worth it all

All she's gotta do is ask me, ask me
And bat those lashes and look at me, look at me
One little kiss is enough to convince me
Y'all, she gets what she wants
Around her finger, she wraps me, wraps me
And all I wanna do is make her happy
It's always an "oh hell yeah" when she turns it on
Yeah, she gets, she gets what she wants

And I don't mind when she gets her way
'Cause when she gets her way, I get mine

All she's gotta do is ask me, ask me
And bat those lashes and look at me, look at me
One little kiss is enough to convince me
Y'all, she gets what she wants
Around her finger, she wraps me, wraps me
And all I wanna do is make her happy
It's always an "oh hell yeah" when she turns it on
Yeah, she gets what she wants

Mmmhmm
She gets, she gets what she wants
