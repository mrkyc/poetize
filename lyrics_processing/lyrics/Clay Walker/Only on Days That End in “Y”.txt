When you left, I told myself
I wouldn't let you haunt my mind
I'd be strong, I'd carry on
And leave the past behind
I'd just forget we ever met
And find somebody new
And now, I want you to know
I'm almost over you

The only time I ever miss you, honey
Is when I'm alone or when I'm with somebody
Your memory never even gets to me
'Cept when I'm awake and when I'm sleepin'
Girl, you never even cross my mind
'Cept just when I think, I left you far behind
Only when I laugh, only when I cry
And only on days that end in "Y"

Now I'll admit, you're hard to quit
I been goin' through a bad withdrawal
But you can bet, I had to let
You walk before I'd crawl
I got my pride, wrong or right
I'm gonna stand my ground
And I ain't gonna let your memory get me down

'Cept just when I think, I left you far behind

And only on days that end in "Y"

When you walked out, I was just about
To break down and beg you not to go
But if you wanna come home
It's only fair that you should know

The only time I ever miss you, honey
Is when I'm alone or when I'm with somebody
Your memory never even gets to me
