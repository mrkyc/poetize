A rodeo queen, a Tennessee dream
With legs that go a country mile
She ain't no kinda preacher's daughter
Just an angel gone a little wild
Got a body she stole from a centerfold
Of a Playboy magazine
Ten spot, can't stop starin'
'Cause she's wearin'
Those skintight Levi jeams

Little Miss Whiskey, keepin' me tipsy
I'ma need to chase her all night long
A little bit of crazy, a little bit of Tennessee
Singin' the words to every country song
Always a good time, break out the moonshine
Make you get up and testify
Won't get no sleep tonight
With little Miss Whiskey on my mind
Little Miss Whiskey on my mind

I was filling my cup when she walked up
And said honey, get a taste of this
She leaned across and whispered soft
And chased it down on my lips
Then, she jumped on the bar dancin' like a star
In the bed of a pickup truck
When she shakes those hips, I can't resist
She knows how to jack me up

Little Miss Whiskey on my mind

Ain't no need to pretend
This thing here is called love
But her lips are laced
And it's all I can taste
And I just can't get enough
Can't get enough

Little Miss Whiskey, keepin' me tipsy
I'ma need to chase her all night long
A little bit of crazy, a little bit of Tennessee
Singin' the words to every country song
