In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Till he said "I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way, my name's Joe."
She said, "I'm from St. Louis"
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you."
When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said, "How much do I owe you?"
Here's what he had to say:
You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you

How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along
And dead on her feet
No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote:
You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you
That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking 'bout the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low:
