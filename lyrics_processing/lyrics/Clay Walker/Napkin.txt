I said I got a chair
With your name on it right there
And by the way, girl
What's your name?
There's an empty glass
Hangin' up on the bar-rack
Girl, tell me, what's your drink?
I was trying to think real fast
Tryna get your attention
'Fore you walked right past
It might have been a little old school
But I said the first thing on my mind

Here's a pen for the napkin
Napkin for the number
Number for the call, girl
I don't wanna wonder
What I'd be missin' on
If you kept walkin' on
So, how 'bout a chance, girl?
How 'bout a dance, girl?
Got my lips sayin' things
I don't understand, girl
And you looked down at the napkin
And handed me your phone
And started laughin'

I put my number in
Then you said you gotta
Roll with your friends
But maybe we could do us a shot
Tell me 'bout yourself
Maybe somethin' else
Yeah, I might never
Would have thought
And then the speakers started blarin' that song
You grabbed my hand and said boy now it's on
And I was thinkin' thank God
That I had that stupid ass pick up line

Here's a pen for the napkin
Napkin for the number
Number for the call, girl
I don't wanna wonder
What I'd be missin' on
If you kept walkin' on
So, how 'bout a chance, girl?
How 'bout a dance, girl?
You got my lips sayin' things
I don't understand, girl
You said one dance
That's all that's happenin'
I spun you around
We started laughin', yeah
Now, I was tryna think real fast
Tryna get your attention
'Fore you walked right past
It might have been a little old school, oh

And here's a pen for the napkin
Napkin for the number
Number for the call, girl
I don't wanna wonder
What I'd be missin' on
If you kept walkin' on
So, how 'bout a chance, girl?
How 'bout a dance, girl?
You got my lips sayin' things
I don't understand, girl
You looked down at the napkin
And now we're lookin' back
