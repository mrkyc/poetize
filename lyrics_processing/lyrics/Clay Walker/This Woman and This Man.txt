Haven't heard half of what you want me to
I hurt so bad over where we've been
Don't know how not to go back there again
I know what I want to say
Can I get it through to you now
In some other way
Like there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance
To hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothing could be sadder than
This woman, this woman and this man
A strangers eyes in a lovers face
See no signs of a better time and place
Have we lost the key to an open door
I feel the need to reach out to you even more
It's a circle we're going round
If we don't get us out from under it's going to take us down
See there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance
To hold on to what they had
How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothing could be sadder than
This woman, this woman and this man

If we come this far and leave it behind
There's only you and me to blame
See there was this woman and there was this man
There was this moment they had a chance to hold on to what they had
How can they be so in love and still never see
How they can get it back again
This woman, this woman and this man
Yeah we can get it back again
This woman, this woman and this man
