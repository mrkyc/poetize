I was raised doin' right from wrong
Baptized under that ol' rugged cross
I try to be a good man, I always give it my best
But truth be told some days I wanna go to the wild, wild west

I wanna line 'em up and drink 'em
I wanna love 'em and leave 'em
Sometimes I wanna just rob a train
Be the first draw in that high noon sun
And feel the kick of my six gun
Yeah, I want "Wanted" above my name
Sometimes I wanna be like Jesus
Sometimes I wanna be Jesse James

I know where to draw the line
But there's just something 'bout that other side
I got angels on my left, and demons on my right
It's a never ending battle, its a constant fight

I wanna line 'em up and drink 'em
I wanna love 'em and leave 'em
Sometimes I just wanna just rob a train
Be the first draw in that high noon sun
And feel the kick of my six gun
Yeah, I want "Wanted" above my name
Sometimes I wanna be like Jesus
Sometimes I wanna be Jesse James

I wanna steal a horse and ride into town
Stare the sheriff down
Tell him there's a new man around here
I wanna walk through those swingin' saloon doors
And hear my spurs hit the wooden floor
I wanna smell nothin' but fear, you hear?
Law don't go around here

I wanna line 'em up and drink 'em (Line 'em up)
I wanna love 'em and leave 'em (Love 'em and leave 'em)
Sometimes I just wanna just rob a train
Be the first draw in that high noon sun (Be the first to draw)
And feel the kick of my six gun (Six gun)
Yeah, I want "Wanted" above my name
Sometimes I wanna be like Jesus (I wanna be like Jesus)
Sometimes I wanna be Jesse James

Do you hear that law dog?
