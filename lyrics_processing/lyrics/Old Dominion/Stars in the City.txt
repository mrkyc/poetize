We took a u-turn down on 42nd street
Almost hit another car
Spilled my coffee on my jeans and I said
"Aw, they're ruined now"
She said
"Naw, they're better now. It's just a matter of perspective."
She kissed my cheek
"Its the little imperfections that make 'em unique."
I don't know how she does it, but she could

See the stars in the city
She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
Finds the glitter in the gritty
I know I ain't much but
That girl sees something nobody else can see
Maybe she sees something in me
If she could see the stars in the city

The more I hang with her the more I realize
There can be beauty in the broken if you open up your mind
She says thinks like
"Ain't this rain nice" and
"Don't sad songs make you smile"
Well if she's crazy
I wanna be crazy too
She's the kinda girl that can break up a band
I wanna see the way that she can

If she could see the stars in the city
That girl sees something nobody else can see
Maybe she sees something in me
If she could see the stars in the city
In the city

See the stars in the city
The stars in the city
She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
Finds the glitter in the gritty
So pretty she can break your heart
Yeah she sees the stars in the city

In the city
