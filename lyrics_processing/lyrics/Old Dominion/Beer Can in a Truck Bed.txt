She was sneakin' up her sundress, showing off her tatty
She said, "I like your ride, maybe you could be my caddy
What you say you pick us up a six-pack of Natty?"
Aww nice
She had a sweet little southern twang
Said, "We don't have to talk about forever things
For tonight maybe we could just hang like a pair of dice"

Said, whatever girl, you know I'm down
I was thinkin' we could crush this town

Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset (Hey)
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best (Hey)
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed

I said, "Girl you got your shades on, looking like you're famous
We could turn this little one horse into Vegas
Holdin' you is like I'm holdin' all the aces
I can't lose"

She said, "Come on, boy, pour it on"
She didn't know that I was already gone

Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset (Hey)
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best (Hey)
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
Yeah

I just wanna roll around with you
Hey babe, I just wanna get down with you
