You're running through my head again
Like one of those summer sing-a-long songs
I can't get you off the tip of my tongue
You're running through my head again
Like one of those summer sing-a-long songs
I play you once and you're just stuck 'em in
I'm either talkin' about ya or thinkin' about ya
Or runnin' my mouth about bein' without ya to all my friends
Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up
I get sick of the sound of my own voice
When I get a couple drinks in me
I gotta admit the way you got me whipped
You know it's kinda embarrassing
I'm tired of the drama so hey little mama, I'm hopin' you wanna
So tell me you're gonna be on your way
Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up

Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips

Shut me up with your love
Just one little taste, baby watch what it does
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up
Yeah, baby shut me up
