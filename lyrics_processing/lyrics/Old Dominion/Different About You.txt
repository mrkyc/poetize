(Ooh, I)
(Ooh, I)

I don't wanna be
The wallpaper in the background
I'd rather be
The book by the bed that you can't put down

Don't nobody wanna be the yellow Starburst
Everybody reachin' for the cherry first
Of all of the ways I could want you
I want you in the worst

I wanna be your favorite "hello"
I wanna be your hardest "goodbye"
The reason that you can't stay awake in the day
'Cause we can't get enough and it's keepin' us up all night
And when your friends all say
"Something's changed, there's sort of an aura around you"
Ooh, I
I wanna be what's different about you
See Old Dominion LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like
The last thing you need
Is a Johnny-come-lately new face
I'll be your king
And I don't mind if you step on my blue suedes

Forget about every player before
Come on, let me be your new high score

I wanna be your favorite "hello"
I wanna be your hardest "goodbye"
The reason that you can't stay awake in the day
'Cause we can't get enough and it's keepin' us up all night
And when your friends all say
"Something's changed, there's sort of an aura around you"
Ooh, I
I wanna be what's different about you

I wanna be your ten-outta-ten
I wanna be your feet off the ground
The thing you never knew that you need
But now you know you can't live without
I wanna be your favorite "hello"
I wanna be your hardest "goodbye"
The reason that you can't stay awake in the day
'Cause we can't get enough and it's keepin' us up all night
And when your friends all say
"Something's changed, there's sort of an aura around you"
Ooh, I
I wanna be what's different about you

I wanna be what's different about you
I wanna be what's different about you

(Ooh, I)
