Girl you're like a model on a Soho street
Walking on air like you own it
It's like I'm sipping on a bottle in a penthouse suite
You're lighting me up and you know it

With that just right Friday night curl in your hair
Got my heart beating louder than Madison Square
That electric energy
Something tells me you're gonna keep me going til the morning light
Girl you're like

New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That uptown something
It's got me coming alive
Baby you're like
New York at night

A party ain't a party girl til you walk in
Cause where you are is where everything happens
You could spin the globe and no matter where it lands
Kick your feet up and call it Manhattan

You're like a Tiffany mannequin  down on 5th Avenue
Making every other woman wish that they could be you
That electric energy
Something tells me you're gonna keep me going til the morning light
Girl you're like

New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That uptown something
It's got me coming alive
Baby you're like
