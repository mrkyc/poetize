A girl like you in a bar like this
Well no offense but you don't fit in
Red lipstick on the rim of that glass
All dressed up, all by yourself, whats up with that?

Are you here to chill
Are you here to party
Are you just here trying to get over somebody
Is it a high, or is it a low
Baby I just gotta know

Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you only having one or one too many
Are you drinking alone or having one more with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty

Is this take a seat or take a hike
Is it take a shot or on the rocks tonight
Is it lonely or just alone
Would you wanna tap your number in if I handed you my phone

Are you here to chill
Are you here to party
Are you just here trying to meet somebody
Letting it get to you or letting it go
Baby I just gotta know

Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you leaning either side of the 50/50
Are you leaving alone or leaving here with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty

Are you windin' up
Or windin' down
Are you paying your tab
Or are we painting the town

Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you only having one or one too many
Are you drinking alone or having one more with me
One more with me

Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you leaning either the side of the 50/50
Are you leaving alone or leaving here with me
