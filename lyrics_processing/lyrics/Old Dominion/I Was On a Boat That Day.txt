A one, two
A one, two, three, four

I remember it like it was yesterday
'Cause it was
I was letting this sun and the rum just do what it does
I threw my phone in the water
Little push off the dock
She was packing her bags I was poppin' a top

Is she gone for the summer?
Gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing?
Was she crying as she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was already so long gone
Yeah

She could have been halfway to Houston but I didn't care
I was drunk as a skunk eating lunch with a cross eyed bear
You've been there
She was looking for something, better than me
I was looking for nothing, just riding the breeze

Is she gone for the summer?
Gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing?
Was she crying as she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was already so long gone
Yeah
Hey hey

I remember it like it was yesterday
'Cause it was
And I still got a buzz
Is she gone for the summer?
Gone for the night?
Gone for the weekend or the rest of my life?
Was she laughing?
Was she crying as she walked away?
I can't say
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was on a boat that day
The river was rolling
I was getting my float on
She was telling me so long
I was on a boat that day
Hey hey hey (Hey hey hey)
I was on a boat that day
