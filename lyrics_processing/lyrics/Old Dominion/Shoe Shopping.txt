Some don't last the way they should
Some make you feel good for a little while
And then you throw 'em away
Some are up on a shelf for some other time
Some are high dollar, some ain't worth a dime
But you keep 'em anyway

Everybody's looking for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye

If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
(Strut down that street tonight)
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high-heel, high-top, pump 'em up, flip-flop
Heads-up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patent leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size

You're stepping on cracks, you're breaking your back
You're working so damn hard just to make it look easy
Come dance with me 'cause dancing's free
Let me sweep you right off your feet
Whatever your style is, girl, that's what mine is
I could go good with your eyes
