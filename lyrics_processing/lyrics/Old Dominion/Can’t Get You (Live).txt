I get bored, I get drunk
I get drunk, I get brave
I get brave, I get a phone
I get a phone, I get a cab
I get a cab, I get to town
I get to town, I get to thinking
I get to thinking you'd love this bar
I get to the bar, but I can't get you

Don't know what it is that I gotta do
But something that I'm missing that I oughta do
I'd get another drink if I wanted to
I would get another girl and I'd get a room
But I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you

I get close, I get a smile
I get closer, I get goodbye
I get the signs all rearranged
I get crazier and crazier every day

Don't know what it is that I gotta do
But something that I'm missing that I oughta do
I'd get another drink if I wanted to
I would get another girl and I'd get a room
But I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you

You got me good, you got my heart
I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you

Don't know what it is that I gotta do
But something that I'm I oughta do do
Don't know what it is that I gotta do
But something that I'm missing that I oughta do
I'd get another drink if I wanted to
I would get another girl and I'd get a room
But I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
I can't get, I can't get, I can't get you
