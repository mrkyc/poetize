I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none
A renaissance man if there's ever been one
Got a pretty good handle on a lot of things
But I ain't figured out everything

'Cause all I know about girls
Is the wide world ain't gonna spin without 'em
But it'll spin around 'em
All I know about girls
Is you best get out of their way
Shut your damn mouth if she got somethin' to say
It's like "Yeah baby, no baby
Whatever you want baby
Whatever it is is my fault"
All I know about girls is
All I know about girls is
I don't know nothing at all

It's probably the reason Hemingway drank
For all the lovesick blues that were written by Hank
They all got stuck right where I am
Just like every other man

All I know about girls
Is the wide world ain't gonna spin without 'em
But it'll spin around 'em
All I know about girls
Is you best get out of their way
And shut your damn mouth if she got somethin' to say
It's like "Yeah baby, no baby
Whatever you want baby
Whatever it is is my fault"
All I know about girls is

I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none
But they sure make learning fun

All I know about girls
