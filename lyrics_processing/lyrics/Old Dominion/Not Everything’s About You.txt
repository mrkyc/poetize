Yeah the song comes on and I sing out loud
And there ain't no road that I can't go down
And I don't think twice when I pass your house all the time
Yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you

Sunsets happening
My phone rings
I'm finally laughing
And doing things with my friends

We drink to this
We drink to that
Let's roll that 8 ball in the rack
It's what I have, not what I had

And the song comes on and I sing out loud
And there ain't no road that I can't go down
And I don't think twice when I pass your house all the time
Yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you anymore

And her own place
Just last Friday
I picked her up and we went out

We drank to this
We drank to that
I turned her onto Fleetwood Mac
It's what I have, not what I had

Yeah the song comes on and I sing out loud
And there ain't no road that I can't go down
And I don't think twice when I pass your house all the time
Yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you anymore

Yeah the song comes on and I sing out loud
And there ain't no road that I can't go down
And I don't think twice when I pass your house all the time
Yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the city lights and the midnight stars
And too many drinks in a Downtown bar
Don't mess me up like they did before
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you anymore
Anymore
Yeah, Yeah
