The Sun going down on a little beach town out west
A wide open highway, a window seat on a jet
The sound of a train pulling out of the station
A man like me should find inspiration in anything
But here I am in this hotel room

Still writing songs about
You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But it's no use
I'm still writing songs about you

A pawn shop in Dallas cut me a deal on a six string
It doesn't know how you look, how you laugh, how you kiss me
Well I'm on the edge of the bed and it's way past two
I'm stuck on a line cause I know what rhymes with blue

You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But I'm still writing songs about you
See Old Dominion LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like
If you ever wake up and wonder what I'm up to
Baby I'm right here
Still writing songs about

You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
Yeah, I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But it's no use
I'm still writing songs about you
