I never liked Def Leppard 'til I heard you sing that song
I never wanted to go to Cali 'til you had that t-shirt on
I never wanted to change my style, change my point of view
The truth is girl, I'd take this whole damn thing and change it all for you

You got that real thing, that good vibe-y feel thing
That roller coaster thrill thing that just keeps turnin' me on (Oh)
Gives me that heart rush, that can't help but wanna touch
And I just can't get enough, baby just keep bringin' it on (Oh)

Crazy, beautiful, sexy, unusual
Innocent, provocative, so classic, you're rockin' it
Crazy, beautiful, sexy

I wanna be one of those late night things that keeps you up
I wanna be the digits that you dial when you get drunk
I wanna be that smile that's on your face that all your friends don't understand
I'll be the stamp from the club that won't wash off your hand

You got that real thing, that good vibe-y feel thing
That roller coaster thrill thing that just keeps turnin' me on (Oh)
Gives me that heart rush, that can't help but wanna touch
And I just can't get enough, baby just keep bringin' it on (Oh)
