You don't have to say
Anything that you don't wanna say
Hey, you don't have to go
We can take it slow
Or we can move it alone, move it along
We can keep it on the couch
And keep the lights on
Naked makin' out, or keep our clothes on
Don't worry 'bout where it's going
If it dead ends, or if it's headed
Up the stairs or down the block
If it last forever until one o'clock
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over
If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til is over

Which way the wind's goin' blow
So let's ride it out for a while right here
You can spend the night, but you don't have to
I can spend the night just looking at you
Here I cannot lie where's going
If it dead ends, or if it's headed
Upstairs or down the block
If it lasts forever or until three o'clock
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over
If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til is over
Let's just let it be
Put your hands on me
Let's not worry about tomorrow
Or the rest of our lives
Let's just let it be
Put your hands on me
All I know is we gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over
If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til is over
