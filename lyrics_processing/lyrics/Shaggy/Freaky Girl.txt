High heels gosh you look sexy
I'd steal a touch if you let me
I'm just dyin' to kick it with you girl
Hey boo show me you're ready
Lips looking juicy like cherry
I can almost taste your flavor girl

But it seems like you're the wrong type
Don't you ever get upset girl, I'd like to see you sweat
It just feels like you're too uptight
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I wanna live

I wanna a freaky girl, somebody just like me
Someone who understands just what a player needs
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me
A very naughty girl that's what I need

Handcuffs, can you get freaky?
How far will you go to please me?
Whips and chains, girl are you down with that?
Strange places searching for pleasure
I want you to meet me wherever
Wearing just an overcoat and hat

Or was I right? You're the wrong type
You don't ever get upset, I ain't never seen you sweat
It just feels like you're too uptight
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I wanna live

I wanna a freaky girl, somebody just like me
Someone who understands just what a player needs
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me
A very naughty girl that's what I need

Want a girl to love me up hug me up give it to me right
Swing from me shower curtain and from me light
Hot piece of loving carry me right through the night
I can't take the pressure when you put pan me haa
Well me love it when you ride pan me haa
Really love it when you climb pam me haa
'Cause me know you naw go hide from me haa
Freaky girl me hipe pan it hee

I wanna a freaky girl, somebody just like me
Someone who understands just what a player needs
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me
