Sexy, hot!
I love your style girl
Put it on me
Brian and Tony Gold let the ladies know
They got it goin' on
Uh! Shaggy!!

Hey sexy lady, I like your flow
Your body's bangin', out of control! (Uh!)
You put it on me (That's right) ceiling to floor
Only you can make me scream and beg for more!

Her body's callin', bawlin'
Got me crawlin' up the wall and
My size ain't small, it's tall
And catch a glimpse her clothes be fallin'
Her neighbor's callin', bawlin'
All this noise is so appallin'
They must believe we're brawlin'
Headboards bang till early mornin'

Hey sexy lady (Uh!!) I like your flow
Your body's bangin' (Yo) out of control!!! Yo! (A big tune)
You put it on me (Uh!!) ceiling to floor (Ceiling to floor girl)
Only you can make me (Uh) scream and beg for more!!!
