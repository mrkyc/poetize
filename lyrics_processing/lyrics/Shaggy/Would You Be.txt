Baby, I hope you dun get offended in anyway ya know
But your beauty is so magnificent
I'm just tempted to touch ya know
Yo bebe, jus a meks sha a gwaan now?

Would you be offended if I told ya
I like the way you lick your lips
Would you be offended if I showed ya
How I like to work those hips
Is it a rude for me to wink
And let you know I like what I see
Would you be offended if I touch ya
Imagine how it could be

Your like a jewel, baby
This ain't no pick up line
Epitome of a lady, truly one of a kind
Wear a precious diamond, wid all dem polish shine?
Can't wait to hold you closer, can you read my mind?
Later images for which I won't apologize
I hope that you can see the passion in my eyes
Won't over step our boundaries
These words are hard to find
Stated my intentions
Hope you my way inclined
