Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you? (Ah!)
We've got some work to do now (Said we've got some work to do now)
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now (We need some help from you now)

Once again, I'm 'onna fall
Once again, I find my back is up against the wall
Will somebody help me? Please, hear my call
Or get a message to my dog and we'll be on the ball
'Cause everybody need a friend that they can depend on
Someone who could help them out of a situation
And only a friend alone can understand my pain
If only I could get the message to my Great Dane

Once again, I'm in a jam
Once again, I never seem to ever have a plan
You know me I'm in trouble man, can you lend a hand
Right now, I am reachin' out to Scooby and the gang
Sure feels good to find a friend that you can lean on
And they wouldn't leave you if you say you saw a demon
And even though sometimes I am a little outta luck
And if I worry much I know my dog has got my back
And I know that even if it means he'd have to fly like a bird (Spread your wings)
I know he'll be here for me now and match my word (Ah, ah, what!)

You're not fooling me 'cause I can see (Ah!)
The way you shake and shiver (Yay-yah!)
