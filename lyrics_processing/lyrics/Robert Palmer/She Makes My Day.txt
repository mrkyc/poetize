I feel so lucky loving her
Tell me what else is magic for?
She thinks it's better left unsaid
She makes her mind up at a glance
It really made a difference
I seem to be unconditionally hers

She's like a new girl everyday
And all the rest don't bother me
I'm far too busy loving her

I'll never be lonely now I know her (She trusts her intuition)
She fills my heart with joy (That's in our best interest)
She makes my day
She just has to smile (She make a difference)
To blow my cares away
She just has to touch my hand (She had a smiling face)
To make me stay

She's all good lovin' at once
She's all good lovin' at once
She's all good lovin' at once
She's all good lovin' at once

Our love was unintentional
She says we're not responsible
She thinks with her chin up
She always makes uncommon sense
Always knows just what to say
She always takes me unawares

In less time than it takes to fall
I'm here and there you are
We never fought it anyway

I'll never be lonely now I know her (She trusts her intuition)
She fills my heart with joy (That's in our best interest)
She makes my day
She just has to smile (She make a difference)
To blow my cares away
She just has to touch my hand (She had a smiling face)
To make me stay
