It's crazy, but I'm frightened
By the sound of the telephone (Oh, yeah)
I'm worried that the caller
Might have awful news (Oh my)
Who knows these days
Where on earth the money goes (Oh, yeah)
No doubt we could put it to a better use (Oh my)

You keep insisting that nobody showed you
How to keep relationships (Oh, yeah)
Your daddy made a real good try (Oh my)
You said you knew all along
We could work it out (Oh, yeah)
Do you have to make a fuss every time we fly?

Ooh, I'm looking for clues

I'll have to make an effort now
Just to be serious (Oh, yeah)
Nobody's gonna give you
The benefit of the doubt (Oh my)
Every time I pick a paper up
It's harder to believe the news (Oh, yeah)
I'm gonna have to shake it up
And twist and shout (Oh my)
You might also like
You can't do nothing that you
Don't put your mind to (Oh, yeah)
I suspected all along
You were a dream come true (Oh my)
I'm never in the dark
'Cause my heart keeps me well informed (Oh, yeah)
I'm convinced that there's
A way of getting through to you

Ooh, I'm looking for clues

It's crazy, but I'm frightened
By the sound of relationships (Oh, yeah)
I swear we could put it to a better use (Oh my)
Do hurry baby you've forgotten
How to catch a night groove (Oh, yeah)
You told all the callers you were not amused

Ooh, I'm looking for clues

You keep insisting that nobody showed you
How to use a telephone (Oh, yeah)
Nobody's gonna give you a second chance (Oh my)
I don't have to make an effort now
To find out where the money goes (Oh, yeah)
Do you have to make a fuss
Every time we dance?
Ooh, I'm looking for clues
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
Ooh, I'm looking for clues
Ooh, I'm looking for clues
Ooh, I'm looking for clues
Ooh, I'm looking for clues
Ooh, I'm looking for clues
