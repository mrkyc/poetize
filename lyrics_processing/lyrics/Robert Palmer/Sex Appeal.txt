You got my number
Out the blue you created this obsessive desire
You steal my thunder
I can't resist your sex appeal
You're kisses make me dizzy
The things you do you know they drive me out of my mind
I can't resist your sex appeal
You take it to the limit
Imagination running till
It's out of sight
You haunt my dreams
You make me fantasise
All of your moves, I've got them memorised
Under your spell you've got me hypnotised
My body aches to make you satisfied
I can't resist your sex appeal
I lose my inhibitions
The way you move you make me feel
Completely wild
I can't resist your sex appeal
I knw you will deliver
You kiss my wildest dreams
Then take me out
You might also likeWhen we make make love
Our bodies synchronise
We find the grooves and then we improvise
We lose ourselves within each others eyes
I long for you to share my appetites
I can't resist your sex appeal
You're kisses make me dizzy
Imagination running till it's out of sight
You take me right out of this world
Closer to heaven
How did you know how to capture all my secret desires
Now and forever
I can't believe
The way you tantalise
I love the way you take me by surprise
You turn me on
It's you I idolise
My body years to keep ypu satisfied
I can't resist your sex appeal
I lose my inhibitions
The way you move you make me feel
Completely wild
I can't resist your sex appeal
I know you will deliver
You kiss my wildest dreams then take me out
I can't resist your sex appeal
I can't resist your sex appeal
I can't resist your sex appeal
I can't resist your sex appeal
I can't resist your sex appeal
