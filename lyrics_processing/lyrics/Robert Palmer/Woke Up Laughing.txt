I was waiting for you
I was sat in the sun
I could picture your face
On the tip of my tongue
I woke up laughing

I broke into my sweat
I broke into a run
You were hot on my heels
So I hired a gun
I woke up laughing

I was flat on my back
I was taking a plunge
It was making a stand
But my plan was undone
I woke up laughing

Well I planned an escape
For the middle of June
But I dug too fast
And I fired too soon
I woke up laughing
I woke up laughing
You might also like
You make yourself a fortune
Out in Hong Kong
You sit at home and wonder
Whether you were wrong
You take a small vacation
Just to keep sane
You find on your return
Your home has blown away

You meditate, you make haste
You run a risk, you come late
You pay a bill, you lose face
You're not fully unaware
Are you a star or are you a fake?
If you fall do you break?
You go to war, you make love
You sign out in a box

I was waiting for you
I was sat in the sun
I could picture your face
On the tip of my tongue
I woke up laughing
I broke into my sweat
I broke into a run
You were hot on my heels
So I hired a gun
I woke up laughing

I was flat on my back
I was taking a plunge
It was making a stand
But my plan was undone
I woke up laughing

Well I planned an escape
For the middle of June
But I dug too fast
And I fired too soon
I woke up laughing
I woke up laughing
I woke up laughing

You make yourself a fortune
Out in Hong Kong
You sit at home and wonder
Whether you were wrong
You take a small vacation
Just to keep sane
You find on your return
Your home has blown away
You meditate, you make haste
You run a risk, you come late
You pay a bill, you lose face
You're not fully unaware
Are you a star or are you a fake?
If you fall do you break?
You go to war, you make love
