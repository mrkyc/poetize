Oh, things ain't what they used to be
No, no, where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows
From the north, West, south and east
Oh, mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be
No, no, oil wasted on the oceans
And our seas, fish full of mercury
Oh, mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be
No, no, radiation underground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live near by are dying
Oh, mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be
No, no, what about this over-crowded land?
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
I want you and I want you
The right way, I want you
But I want you to want me too
Want you to want me, baby
(Said I want you to love me)
Just like I want you
Ooh...
Oh, I'll give you all the love
You want in return, sweet darlin'
Your happiness is all I crave
Ooh, it's too bad
It's just too sad
You don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, baby
I want you, the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you
Ooh...
A one way love is just fantasy
Oh, sugar, to share is precious
Pure and fair, ooh
Don't play with something
You should cherish for your life, baby
Don't you want to care?
Lonely? I'm there... I want you!
Oh, mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be
No, no, where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows
From the north, West, south and east
Oh, mercy, mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be
No, no, what about this over-crowded land?
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
