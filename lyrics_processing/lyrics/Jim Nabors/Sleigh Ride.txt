Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, "Yoo-hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
It's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray (Farmer Gray)
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop; Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy (You can't buy)
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too (I love a sleigh ride)
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, "Yoo-hoo" (I love a sleigh ride)
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
It's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

We're together, lovely weather
When you're by my side
On a lovely Christmas Eve
