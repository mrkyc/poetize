Well, go, go tell it on the mountain
Well, go tell it (On the mountain)
I said, go, tell it on the mountain (Go, tell it)
Jesus Christ is born (Halleluiah)

Go, tell it on the mountain (Go, tell it)
Over the hills and everywhere (Well, go, tell it)
Go, tell it on the mountain (I said, go, tell it)
Jesus Christ is born (Halleluiah)
Well, go, tell it on the mountain (Go, tell it)
Let your merry voices ring (Well, go, tell it)
Go, tell it on the mountain (I said, go, tell it)
Let the world proclaim Him King

(Go, tell it)
(I said to go, go, tell it)
(Oh, well, we'll proclaim Him King)

Oh, well, children let my story begin
There was no room at the inn
But throughout the cold and icy night
There a star shone warm and bright
Well, the wise men three, they saw the star
And they followed it from fields afar
Bearing gifts of myrrh and incense rare
To the infant in the manger there
You might also like
So, we will, go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born
Yes, go, tell it on the mountain (Go, tell it, go, tell it)
Let your merry voices ring
Go, tell it on the mountain (Go, tell it on the mountain)
Let the world proclaim Him King

Go, tell the world this glorious morn
The baby Jesus is born
Like the three wise men
We'll follow them to town of Bethlehem
Tell the people of this Holy land
Come along and join our happy band
We can sing his praise in every way
On this merry, merry Christmas day

Yes, we will go, tell it on the mountain (Tell it on the mountain)
Over the hills and everywhere (Halleluiah)
Go, tell it on the mountain (Tell it on the mountain)
Jesus Christ is born
Yes, we will go, tell it on the mountain
Let your merry voices ring
Go, tell it on the mountain
Let the world proclaim Him King
Let the world proclaim Him King
