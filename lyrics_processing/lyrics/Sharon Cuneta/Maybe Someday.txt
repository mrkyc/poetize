I can't forget the way it used to be
How could you and I become just a memory?
The gentle smile, the warm embrace
I need them more each day
So close to me, but far away
Is there really nothing left to say?

I can't remember when you weren't in my life
Was it like today when the nights are cold
And nothing seems so right
Is it over now, should I just let go?
Can it ever be the same?
You're all I want and all I need
Won't it take away the pain?

Maybe someday
You'll realize that you belong with me
And look into my eyes again and say
"Baby, I'll stay and this time it'll never end."
Maybe someday
You'll be there and I start to live my life again
The way I did before
Then you'll hold me tight
And you'll never let me go
You might also like
We had a lot of dreams
Made plans along the way
And I believed you when you said
Forever you would stay
Now, I'm all alone looking just for you
Wondering if you miss me too
I still dream of only me and you
Is there nothing I can do?

Maybe someday
You'll realize that you belong with me
And look into my eyes again and say
"Baby, I'll stay and this time it'll never end."
Maybe someday
You'll be there and I start to live my life again
The way I did before
Then you'll hold me tight
And you'll never let me go

Maybe someday
You'll realize that you belong with me
And look into my eyes again and say
"Baby, I'll stay and this time it'll never end."
Maybe someday
You'll be there and I start to live my life again
The way I did before
Then you'll hold me tight
And you'll never let me go (Never let me go)
When I was holding on tight
