Well, I sit here on a lonely night
While the cold rain is fallin'
But I should be gettin' over you instead
Oh, if you think you're not the reason
For the reason I ain't callin'
Then you better think about the things you've said
Too much stormy weather
Makes me want to call you up and talk about forever
But I know better, ooh

You're a lesson learned, a page that's turned
And I don't plan on reading it again
'Cause we've paid the cost of loved and lost
And I don't want to go back where I've been
Where I've been isn't love that you left
No forgive and forget
Just let go and get back together
'Cause I know better

Well, I can see a ray of hope
Just over my blue shoulder
You can bet it ain't you standing there
Oh, I'm tired of pretendin'
'Cause pretendin' gets me nowhere
I was crazy thinkin' that you ever cared
But that's why I'll never
Put my hopes and dreams we had back when we were together
'Cause I know better, ooh
