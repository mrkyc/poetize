I know what you're using tonight
I know how you like it
I know you can fight it
Keep you up till morning light
Energy is rising, everybody's flying tonight
The music makes it groove you
The night it makes it move you
The time it makes, it feel alright

No, you don't fight the fever
Just get up and let it all go
Oh, I don't think I'm dreaming
Headache is steaming
You know just how far you can go
You can feel it, if you feel it
Trouble that you're far out of sight
Still you keep on running
Looking for more money
Dancing to the speed of the night
