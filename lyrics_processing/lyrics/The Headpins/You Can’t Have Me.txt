Tryin' to track you down
Trying to sit you down, tie you down
Make you understand me now
We have fought a long time ago
Wonderin' where you been so long
You can't be always right
I gotta make you hear
You can't have me if you treat me that way
You'll never catch me hangin' round this place
Yeah, yeah
You can't keep me hanging on this way
There has to be some changes made
You can't have me if you treat me that way
You'll have to find some other way
You can't keep me hanging on this way
There has to be some changes made
You can't have me if you treat me that way
You'll have to find some other way
Stayed at home alone, cried the blues
Wonderin' why its been so long
Turn around and you're gone
But you're not just who you think I am
You might also likeAnd it's getting no hate, come so late
I'm wonderin' where you are
You can't be always right
I gotta make you hear
You can't have me if you treat me that way
You'll never catch me hangin' round this place
You can't keep me hanging on this way
There has to be some changes made
You can't have me if you treat me that way
You'll have to find some other way
You can't keep me hanging on this way

You got me running 'round town
Tryin' to track you down
Trying to sit you down, tie you down
Make you understand me now
When I am home alone, cry the blues
Wonderin' what I said so wrong, so wrong
You can't be always right
