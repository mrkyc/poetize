I turn in your direction
I always listen to you
I'm needin' your protection
When things are draggin' me down
I recreate the situation
Always end up turnin' 'round
And delay the action
If I can't find what I'm looking for
I was in it for you
If I can't find what I'm looking for
I was in it for you
Don't ya ever leave me
Don't ya ever leave me alone
Don't ya ever leave me
Don't ya ever leave me alone
I'll never find it out on my own
It takes a fool to find the answer
But I will bring you through to the blinds
It's hardly worth the aggravation
When things are draggin' me down
I recreate the situation
Always end up turnin' 'round
And delay the action
