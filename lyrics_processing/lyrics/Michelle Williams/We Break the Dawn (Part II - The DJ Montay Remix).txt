Hey lil' mama
Tell me would you like it if the rain, rain came your way
I got me a couple dollars I could throw you on stage
I love the night life, allergic to sun rays
That's when them Apple Bottoms come out and they get paid
Like uh, truck stop, nah, we in the club till the bus stop, stop
This how we does until it shut down
Now shorty get you opened up
'Cause if you ain't, I'ma tell them like ooh, Michelle, tell them

Oh there's something 'bout the skylight tonight
Something that makes me know everythin's gon' be alright
There's something in the way that the stars align
There's not a single moment I'ma pass by

The hour's now, the bass is loud
The disco lights shining through the crowd
We're holding time in our hands and it stops when we say
And we ain't stopping 'til the morning light

Hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stopping for no one, the night is young
Don't let 'em turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done when we break the dawn
We break the dawn, we break the dawn
We break the dawn, we break the dawn
You might also like
Oh, there something on the surface right now
Somethingthe keeps me moving, digging deeper down
So I just let the speakers speak to me
Vibrations moving on the floor, all around

The hour's now, the bass is loud
The disco lights shining through the crowd
We're holding time in our hands and it stops when we say
And we ain't stopping 'til the morning light

Hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stopping for no one, the night is young
Don't let 'em turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done when we break the dawn
We break the dawn, we break the dawn
We break the dawn, we break the dawn

The daylight scene never hurt nobody
And if the DJ decides there ain't no more party
'Cause we determine when we're good and ready
We step outside 'til the sunrise, wait up and let me
Hey, I remember that, that, that, when the lights came on
I made it to the crib when my baby came home
Trying to hold back the sun when I wasn't that strong
Time on my hands, look, Flo Rida got grown
Right lane, Rolex, all across money
Turn off the lights and my wrist still sunny
No more curfew, clubbin' is the virtue
And the moon, now my dance piece, nothin' but a surf, boo
Yeah shawty, 360 degrees
So tell the DJ to party, I ain't ready to leave
I want it, hot, hot till I'm feelin' the heat
And if I'm in the sweat box then I'm spillin' my greed
Now my fresh T-shirt, yup, that'll work
Back with your skirt through lil' mama, this verse
No disc, keep it poppin', don't go to commercial
Let me decide when we done with rehearsal

We ain't goin' nowhere 'til we good and ready
Oh, break the dawn

Hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stopping for no one, the night is young
Don't let 'em turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done when we break the dawn
We break the dawn, we break the dawn
We break the dawn, we break the dawn
We hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stopping for no one, the night is young
Don't let 'em turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done when we break the dawn
We break the dawn, we break the dawn
