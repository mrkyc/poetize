Da, do
Da, do
Doo, doo, doo, uh
La, da-da-da-da, ah
Listen

You know I've had my share of ups and downs
You live and learn, this world keeps on turnin' round
Sometimes, those rainy days seem like they last forever
Wish I could turn the page and move on (And move on)
Been lonely for the days we used to sit here talkin' all through the night
I'm tryin' to keep my spirits high so I can walk in (Into your light)
Used to be right next to me
All the things you dream about when you're a teen
Now, it seems like everything's so far away
Then, one day, you know

I heard a word
Saying, "Girl, you'll be fine"
I heard a word
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away
Warmed me up inside like a summer day
So glad to say that you'll never break your promises
You might also like
I thank you Lord, I thank you now
'Cause everybody needs (Needs)
Somebody standin' by their side
You look at the road, it gets rough
Still, you say to yourself, "Gotta drive"
Now, I'm ready for the fight (For the fight)
Send a little help, let your angels fly (Fly)
Heard the words deep down inside, I will survive
I'm stronger, 'cause I

I heard a word
Saying, "Girl, you'll be fine"
I heard a word
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away
Warmed me up inside like a summer day
So glad to say that you'll never break your promises

You promise me you'd love me (Love me)
You promise me you'd bless me (Bless me)
You said to me that on your shoulder, I could cry
And if I did, you'd dry my eyes and hold me
I'm so glad that you took all the hurt away (Took all the hurt away)
Warmed me up inside (Whoa)
So glad that you never break your promises
You got me singing
La, da-da, da-da
Oh, oh
Singin' la, da-da, da-da
Oh, oh, ooh
You took
You took my hurt away (Took all the hurt away)
Warmed me up inside like a summer day
So glad to say that you never break your promises
Ooh, oh, oh

I heard a word
Saying, "Girl, you'll be fine"
I heard a word (I heard a word)
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away
Warmed me up inside like a summer day (Warmed me up inside)
Yes, you did
So glad, so glad, so glad, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I heard a word (Oh, oh, oh)
I heard a word (I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad)
