Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh

Did you really think you could call the shots?
I wouldn't figure it out or connect the dots?
In so many lies, what's the meaning? (Oh, oh, oh)
Did you really think you could cause me pain?
You stepped on the track right in front of the train
Now it's only shame that you're feeling (Oh, oh, oh)

So unexpected
The tables have turned
I'm laughin' now
Because the joke is on you (Ooh)
And it's so unexpected
That you're getting burned (Now I can smile)
Now I can smile
'Cause all my pain is removed

So unexpected
Unexpected
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I was always a few steps ahead
Now I'm movin' on, 'cause you've made your bed
And you're surprised that I'm leaving (Oh, oh, oh)
Now you're barely here, hanging on the thread
Wishin' I was near, but I'm gone instead
Now you're paying the price for your deceiving
And I bet you didn't see it coming

So unexpected
The tables have turned (I'm laughin' now)
I'm laughin' now
Because the joke is on you (Ooh)
And it's so unexpected
That you're getting burned
Now I can smile (Smile)
'Cause all my pain is removed

So unexpected
Unexpected
Oh, oh
Yeah

Now the joke is on you
Said it makes you laugh, now it makes you cry
And now you know just what I went through
There's a different path, have to say goodbye
Isn't life so complicated?
Look at all the love you wasted
Boy, you know you played me like a fool (Yes, you did)
And now it's coming back on you
So unexpected (So unexpected)
The tables have turned (The tables have turned)
I'm laughin' now (Oh)
Because the joke is on you (Joke is on you)
And it's so unexpected
That you're getting burned
Now I can smile (Oh, oh)
'Cause all my pain is removed

So unexpected
So unexpected, hey
Oh, oh
Oh

(So unexpected) I know it don't feel good
(Unexpected) But you should've known
It would come back on you
Now you know how it feels (Oh, oh)
