Let me tell you I appreciate all the love and strength you've shown
I know it's hard to keep a smile on your face
And nobody could ever take their place
Every mother, every sister, brother, every child that's now gone
I know they're smilin', lookin' down on your face
In a better place, I'll hear them sing

Can't nobody hurt me
Can't nobody fade me, oh no
I'm resting in a better place, oh no (No, no, no, no)
Can't nobody harm me (No)
Can't nobody touch me, oh no (Now)
I'm resting in a better place

I'll keep standing through the trials of life
Even if I stand alone
Through the times when I feel I can't go on
I feel a hand pushin' me upward
And I don't have no time for haters
This journey will be enough
I'm in a much better state of mind
And this is where I'll stay, a better place
