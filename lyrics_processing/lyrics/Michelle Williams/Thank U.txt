I bet you're surprised
To see me waiting up for you
There's something I just gotta say
Never in my life
Could I have ever imagined that
That love was ever gonna feel this way

And I never ever felt so special
Never knew something good be so true
And I'm so much better, pray for forever
Baby, I owe it all to you

I wanna thank you
For staying out late all the time
While you were out getting yours
Boy, I was getting mine
I wanna thank you
For the times you cheated on me
'Cause I almost loved you forever
Never would have found someone better

I wanna thank you, thank you
For losing me
I wanna thank you, thank you
For losing me
You might also like
Don't look surprised
You really think I was so blind
I wouldn't notice the signs
And it was you
Who gave me all the time to find
All the love that you ain't giving me no more

And I never ever felt so special
Never knew it could feel so good inside
I'm so much better, pray for forever
So before I say goodbye to you

I wanna thank you
For staying out late all the time
While you were out getting yours
Boy, I was getting mine
I wanna thank you
For the times you cheated on me
'Cause I almost loved you forever
Never would have found someone better

I wanna thank you, thank you
For losing me
I wanna thank you, thank you
For losing me
I've never been so sincere
'Cause all the things you did
Made everything so clear
Baby, understand
I wouldn't have find a real man
If it wasn't for you
I wanna thank you
For leaving me alone at night
I wanna thank you
For not coming up with better lies
'Cause he loves me better
Than you could ever
And I owe it all to you

I wanna thank you
For staying out late all the time
While you were out getting yours
Boy, I was getting mine
I wanna thank you
For the times you cheated on me
'Cause I almost loved you forever
Never would have found someone better

I wanna thank you
For staying out late all the time
While you were out getting yours
Boy, I was getting mine
I wanna thank you
For the times you cheated on me
'Cause I almost loved you forever
Never would have found someone better
I wanna thank you, thank you
For losing me
I wanna thank you, thank you
