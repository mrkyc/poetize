So glad to be here
Breathing, walking, talking, yeah
Living, loving you, yeah
Is all I wanna do
Gotta lift my hands every time I get a chance
Gotta let you know I love living this life with you

Wonderin' why I smile, why I'm so happy now?
'Cause it wasn't always like this
Yeah, it took me a while
To figure out that you were all that I need
And nothing has been better than the love you show me, I'm

So glad to be here
Breathing, walking, talking, yeah
Living, loving you, yeah
Is all I wanna do (Now, all I wanna do)
Gotta lift my hands every time I get a chance
Gotta let you know I love living this life with you

It could have been me sleeping on the street
With no food to eat but I thank God that ain't my story
So I won't complain, I won't sing no sad song
'Cause everything ain't right but everything ain't wrong, I'm
