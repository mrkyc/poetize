Thought I was standing tall
I thought I'd seen it all
But baby, I was wrong
'Cause you're the greatest
I've walked a thousand miles
But nothing's what I'd found
Until you came around, no
'Cause you're the greatest

Searched high and low for love
Just to find out that it was here all along
And I'm knowin' what I'm wantin'
I should've been chasing you

And I was reaching for the stars (Reachin' for the stars, yeah)
Well, I didn't have to look so far
'Cause love's where you are
But I didn't have a clue
And now I realize (I realize that)
That the stars are in your eyes (They're in your eyes, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you always shine
Baby, you're the greatest
You might also like
Thought everything had changed
Until the day you came
And took away the pain
Baby, you're the greatest
I always wore a frown
I never used to smile
Until you showed me how
Baby, you're the greatest

Searched high and low for love
Just to find out that it was here all along
And I'm knowin' what I'm wantin'
I should've been chasing you

And I was reaching for the stars (Reachin' for the stars)
Well, I didn't have to look so far (But I had you right here)
'Cause love's where you are
But I didn't have a clue
And now I realize
That the stars are in your eyes
'Cause you always shine
Baby, you're the greatest
Reaching for the stars, then I bumped into you
And I cannot believe that I was searching so long
Ooh, baby, I'm so taken
And all that I need is to wake up in your arms

And I was reaching for the stars (I don't even have to look no more)
Well, I didn't have to look so far
'Cause love's where you are
But I didn't have a clue
And now I realize (I realize)
That the stars are in your eyes (They're in your eyes)
'Cause you always shine (Yeah)
