There are times that I can count and say
That life seems so unfair
I just wanna be in your presence, Lord
Because there is safety there
For I know that you will not put more on me than I can bear
So, I will trust you, for I know that you care
I know you care for me

Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
I know that you care for me
That's why I can stand and fight (I know that you care)
I can make it through the night (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Because you care for me (Lift your voice and sing, ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
I know that you care for me
That's why I can stand and fight
I can make it through the night (I can make it through the night)
Because you care for me (Care for me, care for me)

So, right in the midst of my storm
I have peace within my heart
I know that you're by my side
And your presence will never depart
For I, I believe that all my burdens you will share
So, I cast them on you, 'cause I know that you care
I know you care for me

Because you care for me (You care for me)

When I was down, you lifted me
When I was sick, you healed me
That's why I depend on you
'Cause I know your love is true (Ooh)
Oh, so true
And I love you
Yes, I do
And I praise you
Oh yes, I do
