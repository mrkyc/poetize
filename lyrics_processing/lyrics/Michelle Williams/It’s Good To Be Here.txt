We gon' do the Chicago style
Yo Michelle, you ready?
We gon' testify a little bit
Get the mic
Get the mic
Get the mic
Ooh whoa
Just another day's journey
And I'm glad about it
I got my health and my strenght
I can shout about it
Somebody didn't make it
They can't testify the day
That's why I'm so grateful
And I'm mighty glad to say
It's good to be here - Mmm... humm...
It's good to be here - So good
It's good to be here - Yes it is
It's good to be here - I'm so grateful
It's good to be here (it's good) - Uh huh
It's good to be here (good) - So good
It's good to be here (good) - Oh oh
It's good to be here
Wait a minute
Take your time
Got the love of my family
And all of my friends
Won't take them for granted
I'll always treasure them
See tomorrow is not promised
Enjoy life today
And always remember
To be thankful and say
It's good to be here - It's good to be here
It's good to be here - Good to see another day
It's good to be here
It's good to be here - So thankful
It's good to be here (good) - So grateful
It's good to be here (good) - So good to be here

It's good to be here - Overjoyed
It's good to be here - To be here
It's good to be here - Oh oh oh
It's good to be here - I'll always remember
It's good to be here (good) - To be thankful and say
It's good to be here (good) - He-ey...
It's good to be here (good) - So good to be here
It's good to be here - Got a smile on my face
Giving honor to God
Who's the head of my life
So good to be here
So good to be here
I wanna thank Him for the good, the bad (it's good)
The happy, the stress (it's good)
The ups, the downs (good)
The laughs, the frowns
Feels so good

It's good to be here (good) - It feels so good
It's good to be here (good)
It's good to be here - It feels so good
It's good to be here (good)
It's good to be here (good) - To see another day
It's good to be here (good)
It's good to be here - I could have been dead
It's good to be here (good) - Uh huh

It's good to be here (good)
It's good to be here - But you kept me here
