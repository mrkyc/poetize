Is there somebody, there somebody
Is there somebody, there somebody
Is there somebody who's ever been in love, love
Is there somebody, there somebody
Does he make you feel lucky? Oh, baby
Is there somebody, there somebody
Does he make you feel beautiful?
Is there somebody who's ever been in love
Been in love, lucky girl
Rico Love, go!

Sometimes he calls me on the phone
Just to tell me he loves me
More than anyone else in the world
And when he gets me all alone
Oh, he kisses and he hugs me
And he lets me know that I'm his only girl

He works me like a full time job, no
But I'm lucky that he takes me there
So out of this world, it's hard to believe
That he loves a girl and that girl is me
You might also like
I am the luckiest girl (luckiest girl)
I feel so lucky right now (I'm so lucky)
I am the luckiest girl (look what you doing)
So high you can't bring me down
I am the luckiest girl

I don't have to say a word
'Cause he knows what I'm feeling
Just by looking in my eyes (I am the luckiest girl)
I don't stress them others, no
'Cause I walk on the ceiling
His love is making me high

Anytime there's something wrong, oh
He got a special way of carrying me
So out of this world
It's hard to believe
That he loves a girl
And that girl is me

I am the luckiest girl (luckiest girl)
I feel so lucky right now
I am the luckiest girl
So high you can't bring me down
I am the luckiest girl
He's so out of this world, it's hard to believe
That he loves a girl (I am the luckiest girl)
And that girl is me
I walk on the clouds, tour on the stars
Somebody call the law
'Cause he just stole my heart

I am the luckiest girl (luckiest girl)
I feel so lucky right now (You know I feel so lucky right now)
I am the luckiest girl
So high you can't bring me down
I am the luckiest girl
I feel so lucky right now
