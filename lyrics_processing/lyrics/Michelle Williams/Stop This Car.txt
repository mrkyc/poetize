Uh-huh
Yeah

I see the day pass me by
When I'm next to you
For the longest time
I prayed that I could ride up in your coupe
As the wheels, they roll
Time goes so slow
Feels like I disappear
Got your eyes on the road, in so many things
It's just like I'm not here

I can hear the music playing
Turned it to my favorite station
Wind all on my face
But that's no remedy
When your heart, it seems to be breaking
I tell you and you just don't listen
Don't know how much more I can take it
Nothing to say but

Stop this car
I don't wanna ride no more
As it's just too fast
And you won't pump the brakes
Slow down and hear what I gotta say
Stop this car
Was our destination way too far?
I wanna get out
I don't wanna ride no more
Baby, just stop this car
You might also like
I miss the days when we would
Tour the countryside
And drive for hours on open road
Till the tank was dry
The minutes passed, we'd cry and laugh
I'd get inside your mind
Now it seems you've built a wall that I just can't knock down

I can hear the music playing
Turned it to my favorite station
Wind all on my face
But that's no remedy
When my heart, it seems to be breaking
I tell you and you just don't listen
Don't know how much more I can take it
Nothing to say but

Stop this car
I don't wanna ride no more
As it's just too fast
And you won't pump the brakes
Slow down and hear what I gotta say
Stop this car
Was our destination way too far?
I wanna get out
I don't wanna ride no more
Baby, just stop this car
There's nothing worse than being ignored
And if you don't want me, put the brakes to the floor
When you shut me out, I feel so alone
Pull over right here, open up the door
Watch me, I can be gone, oh yeah

Oh yeah
Stop this car, stop this car

Stop this car (Oh)
I don't wanna ride no more (I don't wanna ride no more)
As it's just too fast (Too fast)
And you won't pump the brakes
Slow down and hear what I gotta say
Stop this car
Was our destination way too far? (Way too far)
I wanna get out
I don't wanna ride no more
Baby, just stop this car
Stop this car
I don't wanna ride no more
As it's just too fast (Too fast)
And you won't pump the brakes
Slow down and hear what I gotta say
Stop this car
Was our destination way too far? (Way too far)
I wanna get out
I don't wanna ride no more
Baby, just stop this car
A dark night surrounding me
