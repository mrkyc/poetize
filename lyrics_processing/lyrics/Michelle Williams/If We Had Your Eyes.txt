Can you spare some change
Is what I heard him say At the light
So I dug through my ashtray
My good deed today
Changed my life
I thought I knew it all, quick to write him off
Looked like he was lost, til I heard him speak
Now I've heard that voice before knew that it was Yours
He said You loved me more than I even believed

People judge from what they see
But Lord You see the whole world

If we had Your eyes
(If we had Your eyes)
We'd see things right
(If we had Your eyes)
If we could just see from Your point of view
Then most things won't be as they seem
If we had Your eyes
(If we had Your eyes)

I had the perfect day
Is what she says to me all the time
She's so beautiful
Nothing's ever wrong in her life
Yeah that's what I thought
Until I saw the scars she cut in her arm
That she was hiding from me
She never said a word
And all I said to her is that
You love her more than she could ever believe
You might also like
People judge from what they see
But Lord you see the whole world

If we had Your eyes
(If we had Your eyes)
We'd see things right
(If we had Your eyes)
If we could just see from Your point of view
Then most things won't be as they seem
If we had Your eyes
(If we had Your eyes)

Show me, teach me, how to see clearly
Live in the spirit, and truth
We'd be able to show love
The way that You love us
(If we could see like You)
Oh uh oh oh oh
If we had Your eyes
If we had Your eyes

If we had Your eyes
(If we had Your eyes)
We'd see things right
(If we had Your eyes)
If we could just see from Your point of view
Then most things won't be as they seem
If we had Your eyes
(If we had Your eyes)
God if I had Your eyes
I could love better and
Have more compassion and
I could understand what I'm going through
While I'm going through
I'd be more patient
God help me to see things the way that you see things
Did I already say help me to be patient? Say that again
