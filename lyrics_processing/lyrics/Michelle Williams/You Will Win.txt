Your Back's Against the Wall
You've Been Feeling as If You Can't Make it
You've given it your All
But, I know what you're going through
Cuz' I've Been there Myself, too
So Don't You dare give in because...
(You Will Win)
You're Feeling Like You Wanna throw in the towel
(You Will Win)
You sure don't Know it but it's gonna Work Out...
(You Will Win)
So Don't look down, keep looking up
(You Will Win)
Forget about what You've done
I promise Life goes on
(You Will Win)
All this time you thought that you were behind
(You Will Win)
But keep on goin' cuz it's your time to shine
(You Will Win)
So Don't look down, keep looking up
(You Will Win)
Forget about what You've done
I promise Life goes on
You've tried everything you know to do
Problems just got worst
Even Family couldn't help you
So you prayed and went to Church
Heard a voice speak into your soul
Saying "I am here with you, I am that I am
And YOU WILL WIN"
(You Will Win)
You're Feeling Like You Wanna throw in the towel
(You Will Win)
You sure don't Know it but it's gonna Work Out...
(You Will Win)
So Don't look down, keep looking up
(You Will Win)
Forget about what You've done
I promise Life goes on
(You Will Win)
All this time you thought that you were behind
(You Will Win)
But keep on goin' cuz it's your time to shine
(You Will Win)
So Don't look down, keep looking up
(You Will Win)
Forget about what You've done
I promise Life goes on
You Made it through your yesterday
I told you that you would (You didn't think that you could)
And it should be plain to see that you've got everything it takes
(Life is about what you make it)
This Moment is Yours, see what God has in store
There's so much to look for
So, give it everything you got, you can do it
So gon' and give it up to God, He can use it
So don't you give in, YOU WILL WIN...
(You Will Win)
You're Feeling Like You Wanna throw in the towel
(You Will Win)
You sure don't Know it but it's gonna Work Out...
(You Will Win)
So Don't look down, keep looking up
(You Will Win)
