Before time was, you were
And when it's over, you will be
My everything
You fulfill my needs
And every morning
You are the song I sing

You are everything to me
You're in every breath I breathe
All of the love I ever need
From my heart to yours (Heart to yours)
You are in everything I do
That's why I keep running to you (Running to you)
All of the words I say are true
From my heart to yours

Before you created heaven and earth
You held me in your heart
You saw mistakes that I would make
And you planned ahead a road for escape

You are everything to me
You're in every breath I breathe (And I pray to you)
All of the love I ever need
From my heart to yours (Oh, my heart to yours)
You are in everything I do (Thing to you)
That's why I keep running to you (Running to you)
All of the words I say are true
From my heart to yours (Heart to yours)
You might also like
I just wanted to tell you
How I feel
From my heart to yours
Oh, I love you
Yes, I do
Because you show your love to me
You gave your life, uh-huh
It was the ultimate sacrifice
And you did it all for me

You are everything to me
You're in every breath I breathe (You're every breath I breathe)
All of the love I ever need
From my heart to yours (From my heart to yours)
You are in everything I do
That's why I keep running to you (I keep on running to you)
All of the words I say are true
From my heart to yours (And I love you)
You are everything to me (I love you, I love you)
You're in every breath I breathe
All of the love I ever need
From my heart to yours (I thank you for loving me)
You are in everything I do
That's why I keep running to you (I thank you for saving me)
All of the words I say are true
From my heart to yours
You are everything to me
You're in every breath I breathe
All of the love I ever need
From my heart to yours
You are in everything I do
That's why I keep running to you
All of the words I say are true
