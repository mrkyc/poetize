Ooh, there's something bout the skylight tonight
Something that makes me know everything's gon' be alright
There's somethin' in the way that the stars align
There's not a single moment I'ma pass by

The hour's now, the bass is loud
The disco light's shinin' through the crowd
We're holdin' time in our hands and it stops when we say, we say
And we ain't stoppin' till the morning light

We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stoppin' for no one
The night is young
Don't let 'em turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done when we break the dawn

We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn

Ooh, there's somethin' on the surface right now
Something that keeps me movin', diggin' deeper down
So, I just let the speakers speak to me
Vibrations movin' on the floor all around

The hour's now (Yes), the bass is loud (Yes)
The disco light's (Yes) shinin' through the crowd
We're holdin' time in our hands and it stops when we say
And we ain't stoppin' till the morning light

We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come (Oh, we ain't gonna stop)
Ain't stoppin' for no one (Baby)
The night is young (Nobody's gonna make us stop all night)
Don't let 'em turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song (Oh)
The night is done when we break the dawn

We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn (Hey, yeah)
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
The daylight scene never hurt nobody
If the DJ decides there ain't no more party
'Cause we determine when we're good and ready
We'll step outside, tell the sunrise, "Wait up and let me...!"
We ain't goin' nowhere till we good and ready
Ooh-oh, oh, break the dawn!

We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stoppin' for no one (No one)
The night is young (The night is young)
Don't let 'em turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song (You heard? Ooh-oh)
The night is done (Keep it goin', baby)
We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come (Hold back the sun)
Ain't stoppin' for no one
The night is young (The night is young, the night is young)
Don't let 'em turn on the lights (Turn on the lights)
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done when we break the dawn

(We gotta hold back the sun)
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
(We gotta hold back the sun)
We break the dawn
We break the dawn (Hey, yeah)
We break the dawn
