I lay in Zion
Our foundation, the stone
I lay in Zion (In Zion)
Our foundation, the stone
Our tried stone, our precious cornerstone
A sure foundation, a sure foundation
Our tried stone, our precious cornerstone
He that believeth shall not make haste
(Rock with me, rock with me, rock with me, rock with me, rock with me)

There's a place we can run and hide
A mighty fortress, all day and night
There's no reason to ever be frightened
Because he's standing, a strong tower

Jesus is the rock in a weary land
If you really, really love him, won't you wave your hands?
If you begin to think about how he's blessin'
Then, you will rock with me (Rock with me)
Didn't he work it out? Uh-huh, I know he did
'Cause he's got a reputation, him we can depend
Reminiscin' on the way that he's been blessin'
Everybody, rock with me, rock with me
You might also like
He's the rock of ages, he's been there for me
Everything he's said gives whatever I need
This rock is a shelter in the toughest storm
That's why I'm leaning on the side of everlasting arms
