It's crazy
What keeps going through my mind
Something is playing with my head (crazy)
How I'm feeling inside, I wish I could see you here instead (baby)
It's so fulfilling oh (the way you give it)
Intimidating (but I)
I want more of it
I'm so tore up 'cause how you give it to me

Got me a sip of hypnomatic
The kiss was the chaser and I ain't mad at it
Followed it up with a little touching
Then the next day I don't remember nothing (baby I'm hungover)
Dizzy 'cause you got to my head
Wish you were here instead (hungover)
Can't focus on what I got to do
Can't stop thinking about you (baby I'm hungover)
Can't even think bout the song
The list goes on and on (hungover)
Baby you got me twisted (hungover)
Baby I'm so sick baby I'm...

It's crazy
What I felt the first time
Can't even find the words to say (crazy)
I think that I'm gonna try cause I don't take you for granted oh no (baby)
It's so fulfiling (the way you give it)
Intimidating (but I)
I want more it I'm so messed up cause how you give it to me
