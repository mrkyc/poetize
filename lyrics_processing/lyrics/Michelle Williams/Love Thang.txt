I could see
If I'd done something noble, incredible or simply wonderful
Then I'd understand just why you care for me
Saved a child from the building on fire
Then fed all the hungry, supplied their needs
Then, maybe it would make more sense
Why you dare to love me but

I can't figure out
Figure out
This love thang (This love thing)
Though we've talked about it all before
Talked about it all before (All)
The truth about
The truth about us
This love thang (No one)
No one else can love me more (Can love me more, love me more)
I can't figure out
Figure out (Ooh)
This love thang (Oh)
Though we've talked about it all before
Talked about it all before (We've talked about it)
The truth about
The truth about us
This love thang
No one else can love me more (No one else can love me more)

Ran to others, part-time lovers for comfort
Lord, I'm sorry, I must have been out of my head
Tell me, how many times did I manage to break your heart?
Break your heart, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Said I'd do but I didn't
No, I should, but I wouldn't
In spite of it all, still you said
I'll always love you, love you as you are

I can't figure out
Figure out

Like a mother's love for her newborn child
You've embraced me and my faults, oh
With a love so strong and unconditional
Never once let me go
I've made mistakes so many times, taken advantage of you
But you've forgiven me time after time
No matter what I do
I'm so in love with you

How could you have so much time for me? (Figure out)
Though we've talked about it all before (Talked about it, talked about it, talked about it)
