Fabo, I got you, nigga (Remix)
I see you, Chico (Let's go)
Westside, what it do, nigga?
Eastside, huh, Slick Pulla, what's happenin'?
You already know  let's get it nigga
Hey, Fabo, you know how I do, this one of love
I don't need nothin', nigga (Let's get it)

I said I'm higher than a motherfucker, right now
I'll shoot a nigga dead in his shit right now
They thought , but I don't see how
Pull up in my car, and them bitches like "Wow"
It was me and Fa-Beezy, he on three pills
Renegotiation, need another three mil
Bitch, you better chill, can't you see I'm froze?
Federales on me, so I ball for the pose
All these feds keep lookin' at me
Slowin' down the trap, make it hard for a G
Got a bitch on Bankhead, nothin' but a dankhead
Slide through on the late night, she give good head
It was me and Slick P, you know we ran a train on her
IOU, you know we ran the game on her
MAC 11 cocked and the AR steady
Run up on me, motherfucker I'm ready

Star Trek, Star Trek
Scotty don't wanna give a star back
I'm in the zone, and I bought me a star gak
And I'm really geeked up, that's a star fact
I'm startin' to see spaceships on Bankhead
I roll with gangstas, pill poppers, and dank heads
I got partnas like Worm, Lil' Boom, Buddy, and Famous
I got sisters like Yasmine, Chocolate, Portia, they dangerous
I fly like blaze, when I'm burnin' purp'
Real powder heads, the burning hurt
Geek music, I'm earning turf
Why you football-soft like Nerf?

I'm in the zone, I gotta see my doctor, Scotty's calling me (Scotty beam me up)
I'm in the zone, I wanna fly, morning, noon, and night (Scotty's calling me)
I'm geeked up, geeked up, geeked up, geeked up
I'm geeked up, geeked up, geeked up, geeked up

I'm geeked up, I can't make it on my own
I'm geeked up, I wish these haters leave me alone
Help me, help me, help me, help me
