Where have you gone
My darling one
Are you on your own
Are you having fun
Is there someone to hold
When you need it bad
Is it uncontrolled
Like the love we had

Does a day go by
Like a memory
Do you ever try
To remember me
In an automobile
Or a crowded bar
Well I hope you're alright
Wherever you are

And if you're still within the sound of my voice
Over some radio
I just want you to know
You were always my only choice
And wherever you go
That I still love you so
If you're still within the sound of my voice
You might also like
In the dead of night
Do you hear me call
Something's quite not right
No one's there at all
Did you make a mistake
Was it in your head
Or was it merely me talking
To your heart instead

And if you're still within the sound of my voice
Over some radio
I just want you to know
That it always made me rejoice
Just to have you so near
There's a place for you here
If you're still within the sound of my voice

I am calling like the echo
Of a passing train that cries
One last time before it fades into
The distant hills and dies
I am sending out a message
Like a ship out on the sea in distress
But only you can send a lifeline out to me
Are you still within the sound of my voice
Why don't you let me know
I just can't let you go
If it's wrong then I have no choice
But to love you until
I no longer have the will
If you're still within the sound of my voice

I am calling like the echo
Of a passing train that cries
One last time before it fades into
