Well I looked into a house I once lived in
Around the time I first went on my own
When the roads were as many as the places I had dreamed of
And my friends and I were one
Now the distance is done
Yeah the search has begun
I've come to see where my beginnings have gone

Well the walls and the windows were still standing
And the music could be heard at the door
Where the people who kindly endured my odd questions
Asked if I'd come very far
And when my silence replied
Well they took me inside
Where their children sat playing on the floor

Well we spoke of the changes that would find us farther on
And it left me so warm and so high
But as I stepped back outside to the gray morning sun
I heard that highway whisper and sigh
Are you ready to fly?

And I looked into the faces all passing by
It's an ocean that will never be filled
And the house that grows older and finally crumbles
That even love cannot rebuild
Well it's a hotel at best
You're here as a guest
You oughta make yourself at home
While you're waiting for the rest
You might also like
Well I looked into the dream of the millions
That one day the search will be through
Now here I stand at the edge of my embattled illusions
Looking into you

Oh yeah, the great song traveler passed through here
And he opened my eyes to the view
And I was among those who call him a prophet
And I asked him what was true
Until the distance had shown how the road remains alone
Now I'm looking in my life for a truth that is my own

Well I looked into the sky for my anthem
And the words and the music came through
But words and music can never touch the beauty that I've seen
Looking into you
And that's true
