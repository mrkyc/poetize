I realize, of course, that it's no shame to be poor
But it's no great honor either
It's written
"When a poor man eats a chicken, one of them is sick"
So what would have been so terrible if I had a small fortune?

If I were a rich man
Yaba biba biba yaba baba biba biba bum
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum
If I were a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work hard
Yaba biba biba yaba baba biba biba bum
If I were a biddy biddy rich
Yaidle deedle deedle daidle man

I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen
Right in the middle of the town
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below
There would be one long staircase just going up
And one even longer coming down
And one more leading nowhere, just for show
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese
And ducks for the town to see and hear
Squawking just as noisily as they can
And each loud *bird noises*
Would land like a trumpet on the ear
As if to say, "Here lives a wealthy man"
Oy

If I were a rich man
Yaba biba biba yaba baba biba biba bum
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum
If I were a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work hard
Yaba biba biba yaba baba biba biba bum
If I were a biddy biddy rich
Yeedle deedle daidle daidle man

I see my wife, my Golde, looking like a rich man's wife
With a proper double chin
Supervising meals to her heart's delight
I'd see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock
Oy, what a happy mood she's in
Screaming at the servants day and night
The most important men in town will come to fawn on me
They will ask me to advise them
Like a Solomon the Wise
"If you please, Reb Tevye..."
"Pardon me, Reb Tevye..."
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes
Ya bee-ah boi-ah bum boi ba-ba-ba ba-bum
And it won't make one bit of difference
If I answer right or wrong
When you're rich, they think you really know

If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray
And maybe have a seat by the eastern wall
And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men
Seven hours every day
That would be the sweetest thing of all
Oy

If I were a rich man
Yaba biba biba yaba baba biba biba bum
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum
If I were a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work hard
Yaba biba biba yaba baba biba biba bum
Lord, who made the lion and the lamb
You decreed I should be what I am
Now would it spoil some vast eternal plan
