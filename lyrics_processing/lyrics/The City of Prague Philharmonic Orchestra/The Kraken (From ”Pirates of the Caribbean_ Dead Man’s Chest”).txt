We don't have to much time
Don't need no potion
Cause the flavor of my kiss is number 9
This is some Ace of Base s***
Cause I'm seein' the sign
Thank you for being patient
Be sure to keep this in mind
It's my sick obsession
I hate the waiting
But I love the tension
It's so frustrating
From the day I met you
This is my confession
This is my confession
I'll tell you what to do
So baby turn it up
Cause the speakers gotta boom

Nothing left to do
I'm thick skin
Tough as a push pin
Don't be dancin' around my feelings
Bitch, I'm a vixen
You should of listened
I like my ice then
Push me down, won't get enough
Who says I'ma miss him?
It's my sick obsession
