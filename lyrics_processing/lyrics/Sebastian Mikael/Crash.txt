(Yeah)
Sometimes words get in the way
Sometimes love is hard to explain
We both pass by, day to day
Your friends say, what more can they say
They just wanna see us crash
And I just wanna make it last
Baby we're moving too fast
And I don't wanna feel the impact, so
Girl I think it's 'bout time for me to pump the brakes
We're two cars speeding down the one-way
And I don't wanna make the wrong decision
Looks like we're headed straight for collision, collision
Looks like we're headed straight for collision, collision
(Looks like we`re headed straight...)
I turn left, you go right
Yeah we get lost, and we both fight
I'm tryna get us in the right direction
This is inadequate, waiting to happen no
They just wanna see us crash
And I just wanna make it last
Maybe we're moving too fast
And I don't wanna feel the impact, so
Girl I think it's 'bout time for me to pump the brakes
We're two cars speeding down the one-way
And I don't wanna make the wrong decision
Looks like we're headed straight for collision, collision
Looks like we're headed straight for collision, collision
(Looks like we`re headed straight...)
I know that some day, one day
We go straight to the top, we ain't gonna stop
We moving forward, forward
We can survive, as long as we gotta drive (hey)
It's a long way to travel
And I got a lot to handle
So we can't take the back road
But baby you are so much more, oh more
Girl I think it's 'bout time for me to pump the brakes
We're two cars speeding down the one-way
And I don't wanna make the wrong decision
Looks like we're headed straight for collision
Girl I think it's 'bout time for me to pump the brakes
We're two cars speeding down the one-way
And I don't wanna make the wrong decision
Looks like we're headed straight for collision, collision
(Looks like we`re headed straight...)
Slow it down, slow it down, hey hey, ohhh!
