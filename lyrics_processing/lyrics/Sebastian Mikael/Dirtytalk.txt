Squeaks in the floor let you know a nigga creepin'

Cleaning her whole chimney out, playin' like the Grinch

You like a whinin' baby
I should come to your saving when you cryin', baby
Praise be to God, my only lie is to find what I need
Which means my drive only moves if you movin' with me
You 'posed to be as close as hope for a brother with fear
Love how you taste my blood, then you fill it with air
I try to repay you with some gold but it couldn't compare
My mama always said them diamonds was a trip to a fair
Yeah, I...
Listen, yeah, yeah, you understand?
