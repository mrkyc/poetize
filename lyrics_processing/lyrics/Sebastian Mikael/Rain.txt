Reflect the faults in my life
It's ironic, I said you fake depression and look at me now
Look at me now, I'm stuck in my mind (My mind)
And I'm tryna put it back in motion
Oh, oh, baby
See, it's kind of hard to function
With this dope in my veins, goin' broke these days
On a hiatus, tryna put it back in motion (Motion, yeah)
Thank God for this moment of revelation

Lost with the odds against me, I'm alive and well
Oh, I can't forget I died back when bottle talk was in me
To your surprise I'm selfish, but that's okay
In my book, you got the cards I dealt with, ooh, ayy
Life's on my shoulders, watch out
Shot cameras and hashtags
These eyes all on you, why's that?
Ain't hidin' from a thing now
Best believe the ass up (Ass up)
I'll turn that to diamonds, update too fast
Locked up with your pride, babe, I'm like, "Who's that?"
She loves attention always (Always, always)
Always, always
Always (Always, always)
You might also likeYeah, fame, thought it would ease the pain
Got close, the closer you kicked it and not seein' what's in front of you
Was an opening, your blessings got your name right on it
Too busy playing this game, ain't nothin' waitin' on you
Save yourself, gettin' help's the only way up out it
'Bout it, you gotta...
Put it back in motion
Put it back in motion (Yeah, yeah)
You tell me to open up more
I feel like I've been too woke
Scared I'm becomin' hateful
All in my dome, all in my dome
Can tell that I've been broken
Still in repair, I'm focused
Out of fucks, out of luck
Roll one up, anything to lift me up
Tell me to open up more
Scared I'm becomin' hateful
All in my
All in my head, yeah
