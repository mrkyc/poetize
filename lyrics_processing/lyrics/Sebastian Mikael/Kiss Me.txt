Girl im here for you
You're under my protection
Just keep goin' for it
And I keep holdin' you down
Know I got a rock on a crown
Whenever you're not around
Take a place for you
Cus' they don't understand what it's like to be like you
If anybody out there can baby you know that I do
So I keep holdin' you down
You just keep on runnin' the town
So you keep your feet on the ground
I be waiting for ya
(Chorus)
So let 'em talk, baby look at me
You got me right here, one heart and I got you
They can try but we'll never leave
There's only one, you're made for me
Only one that's made for me
Only one that's made for me
(Verse: Teyana Taylor)
Boy, I'm here for you
Under your protection
Your love has been a blessing
You teach me all your lessons
I give you my crown and now I got it, I dare them
To come take it now because they gotta get passed you
That's not happenin, no
They don't understand what it's like to be like me
See I can have anything I want, I don't want
If you're not here beside me
So keep holdin' me down
I'mma keep on runnin' the town
Sure you keep yo feet off the ground, oh
I'll be there for you
You might also like(Chorus)
So let 'em talk, baby look at me
You got me right here, one heart and I got you
They can try but we'll never leave
There's only one, you're made for me
Only one that's made for me
Only one that's made for me
(Interlude)
Only one
Only one
Only one
Only one
(Chorus)
So let 'em talk, baby look at me
You got me right here, one heart and I got you
They can try but we'll never leave
There's only one, you're made for me
Only one that's made for me
