Caught up in a rush I love the thrill of it....
The morning sex would always get u lifted...
I know I can be hella nonchalant sometimes
You call, I keep it cool like I got it figured out
But you've been on my mind
I just don't have the time
And you love to analyze all I say when I'm high...
Girl don't rely on me right now
Don't kill it no don't kill it cus I...
I only rely on this high...
Spliff it on and on until I can't feel it yea
Higher than I muthafukkin kite and I need it yea
It keeps me in my zone keeps me in my zone...
:
Times moving slow for me
Smoke empty souls I scream it eats me alive
We always fall into this mood
Fuck highs and lows I steady bleed
I'm numb to it all....(3x)
Fuck highs and lows I steady bleed
:
Coldest world that we live in
Swear in my arms I hold myself no one's got me
I keep rolling with the wrong ones
Speaking holy demons all run
I understand what I did to myself
Slowly drowning in bottomless Wells
At times I dream about burning in hell
I really feel like Ima die

Always on a mission

I just roll my tree low key stay on some meditation
I stay on cloud 9
Only rely on this high
Don't kill it na don't kill it cus I
Only rely on this high
Spliff it on and on until I can't feel it yea
Higher than I muthafukkin kite and I need it Yea
Keeps me in my zone it keeps me in my zone

Times moving slow for me
Smoke empty souls I scream it eats me alive
We always fall into this mood
Fuck highs and lows I steady bleed
I'm numb to it all....(3x)
