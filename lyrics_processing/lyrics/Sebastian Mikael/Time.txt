Ain't she something?
Sundress on with her hair in a braid
Something special
Our connection's more physical
Level one, spiritual
And that's just how my heart is wired
Just let my love fall and love will follow you
I feel like I got one (I know, I know)
That I can show mama (You do)
She be counting my 12 inch ruler and we'd still be in too deep
But not on the wrong foot
Baby, just spread and received my love

I can spend all day out if you want
I can take you places, wanna come?
And I can spend all day until you're down
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time
We ain't gotta ever see the sun
I got everything to turn you on
We can go all day until you're down
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time

(You ready?)
I'm in the mood, I need your love (Turn the lights off)
Come a little closer, baby
(Make it last long) I go long
She'll be sending pictures to my phone
Not the ones she post up in her clothes (Yeah)
Now we getting nasty in my room
Comfortable in panties with no bra
She be getting mad when I take too long
But I gotta let you miss it, it's worth more
Give you a little push, be on the same side (Word)
You know I be performing, I don't have stage fright
I give you head for me, for you in the morning
Breaking backs, beds, just how you want it
Let me get off the phone, swerving lanes like a pro
Open the door, nothing on
The neighbors peek, give 'em a show
Yeah, I'm nasty like that
Just how you like it, don't hold back
You might also like
I can spend all day out if you want
I can take you places, wanna come? (I can take you places)
And I can spend all day until you're down
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time
We ain't gotta ever see the sun (We ain't gotta ever)
I got everything to turn you on (I got everything)
We can go all day until you're down
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time
I can spend all day out if you want
I can take you places, wanna come?
And I can spend all day until you're down
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time
We ain't gotta ever see the sun
I got everything to turn you on
We can go all day until you're down
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time

You ready?
Turn the lights off
I can take you places
