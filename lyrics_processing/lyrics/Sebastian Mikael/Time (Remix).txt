Ain't she something?
Sundress on with her hair in a braid
Something special
Our connection's more physical
Level one, spiritual
And that's just how my heart is wired
Just let my love fall and love will follow you
I feel like I got one (I know, I know)
That I can show mama (You do)
She be counting that twelve inch ruler and we'd still be in too deep
But not on the wrong foot
Baby, just spread and receive my love

I can spend all day out if you want
I can take you places, wanna come?
And I can spend all day until you're down
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time
We ain't gotta ever see the sun
I got everything to turn you on
We can go all day until you're down
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time

(You ready?)
I'm in the mood, I need your love (Turn the lights off)
Come a little closer, baby (Baby, baby)
(Make it last long) I could go for
Ooh, this one right here delectable
It's edible like food
Know he want it raw just like some vegetables, boy, ooh
He say, "How you thick, girl? How you vegan with all that ass?"
Baby, you gotta wait for it
Baby, you gotta pay for it
I know you gotta taste for it (Huh)
Might need a plate for it, babe
I'm not cocky, I don't like to brag
Good head on my shoulders, went to class
No need to be anxious, not too fast, baby
'Cause tonight I'll make time
Tonight I'll make time
Just how you like it, don't hold back (Tell me you want it, baby)
You might also like
I can spend all day out if you want (Hey)
I can take you places, wanna come? (I can take you places)
And I can spend all day until you're down (Ooh, baby)
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time
We ain't gotta ever see the sun (We ain't gotta ever)
I got everything to turn you on (I got everything) (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We can go all day until you're down (Oh)
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time (Time, time, time)
I can spend all day out if you want (Baby, spend all day)
I can take you places, wanna come? (Hey, hey)
And I can spend all day until you're down (Ah)
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time
We ain't gotta ever see the sun (See the sun)
I got everything to turn you on (Turn you on)
We can go all day until you're down (Mm-hmm)
'Cause for you, I got time, time, time

(You ready?)
I'm in the mood
(Turn the lights off)
Smack it, babe
