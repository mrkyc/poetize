I wanna be there for you
Will you be there for me
That's what I'm here for
That's what I live for
That's what I give for
I wanna be there for you will you be there for me, for me

You should know by now how I feel
That my love is real
Feels secure knowing
You've got my heart in away
I can never stray
But now people talk
They say our love won't last (Love won't last)
They say my love for you
Soon it will (past)
But you should know for sure
I will never leave, you're all the man I need
I hope you see

That's what I'm here for
Giving you all of my love
That's what I live for
To be the only one you dream of
That's what I give for
All that I have
I wanna be there for you will you be there for me, for me

Ya so moist
Plus you got the platinum voice
And you fine smelling like 360 Divine
You blow my mind away
Tonight and forever like diamonds al right
We tight like that
Stress time for chillin'
Times is short good and part
Cause you know you're my dime
The top illin'
They jealous cause me you styles killin'
Ain't nothin' happenin' with that breakdown talk
We can walk the walk and keep it real
Like New York I'm sold up, you word up uh
If we just show'em I'll blow'em twice
And we'll just keep flowin' like Chardone'
On ice as we lounge in the crib and parle'
You know what I mean
Not to mention your lover supreme
Move's truly with throughout the evening
I'm here no question as long as I'm peepin' Illtown

That's what I'm here for
Giving you all of my love
That's what I live for
To be the only one you dream of
That's what I give for
All that I have
