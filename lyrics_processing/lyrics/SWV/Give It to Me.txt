Give it to me, baby
Give it to me

I'm the type of girl with class
But you never know what you can get
'Til you go and ask for it
I was shy, but now I finally see
All you have to do is (Just ask)
For anything you want (It's yours)
You get right to the point
(If love) Is what you really need, don't be shy
Just say, "Boy, give it to me, right now"

Give, give it to me, baby (Baby)
Boy, I need you right now
Give, give it to me, honey (Honey)
Give, give it to me, baby (Baby)
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

You feel real good deep inside my (Whole life)
You're rubbing me inside my thigh
You take me on a natural high
You love me the way I want you to
And you know I like it
