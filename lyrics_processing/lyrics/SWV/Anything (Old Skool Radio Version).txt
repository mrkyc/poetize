Anticipation
Of what's to come
I'm so happy
That I'm the lucky one
So long I've waited but
It's never too late for love

And it can't be wrong (And it can't be wrong)
Where I am weak, baby
You make me strong (Make me strong)
I'm down for you
And whatever you want
To do
It's all up to you, because

Dirty Bas, style cuts like glass
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass
Yo Taj, another-like platinum hit
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
Tical, hailing from the Shaolin Isle
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C
With the S-S-double-double-U to the V-V
Me me going downtown, let me see
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now
Listen I ain't sweating no competition
Flow, going mad low like I'm dissing
Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep
Nonstop put you on the chopping block
Unorthodox, add it to the melting pot
I'll do anything, I'm so into you
Right here, I'm Weak, downtown with the Wu
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
The S-S-double-double-U to the V-V
Anything you want me to do
I'll do it
(Oh, anything that you want me to do)
Anything you want me to do
I'll do it
(Oh, anything that you want me to do)
It's all up to you
