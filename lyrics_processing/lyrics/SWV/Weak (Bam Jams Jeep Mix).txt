I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do

I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I don't understand
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do

Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down
When you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do

I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
You're love's so sweet, knocks me off my feet
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do

(I get so weak)
Blood starts racing through my veins
(I get so weak)
Boy, it's something I can't explain
(I get so weak)
Something 'bout the way you do
The things you doo-ooo-ooo, it
(I get so weak) Ooh, Ooh, off my feat
I get so weak

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
Somethin' bout the way you do
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
