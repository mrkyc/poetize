(When you cry) When you cry
(Boy, I'll cry) Boy, I'll cry
(Don't let go) Don't let go
(Or I'll die) Ooh

When you cry, when you cry
Baby, I cry
And if you take your love away, I'll just die
If you love me once, I'll love you twice
So promise me you'll love me for the rest of my life

There's no better place, I'd rather be than in your arms
Holding you close to me
Looking in your eyes, let's me know
That you'll always be here
And your love ain't going nowhere, no

When you cry, when you cry
Baby, I cry
And if you take your love away, I'll just die
If you love me once, I'll love you twice
So promise me you'll love me for the rest of my life

Baby I know no one can take my pain
