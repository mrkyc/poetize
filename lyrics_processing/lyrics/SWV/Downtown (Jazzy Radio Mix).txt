Boy, I want you to listen closely to what I have to say
'Cause this is the way to my heart

Oooh you can't stop till you find my love
You're all that I need, mmmm
That's the love that you've been dreaming of
Oooh, and I like it
Oooh you can't stop till you find my love
You're all that I need, mmmm
That's the love that you've been dreaming of
Oooh, and I like it

You've been wondering how you can make it better
Baby, it's easy to turn my world inside out
Your discovery will take us to another place
Baby, on that, there is no doubt
I've been waiting for the special moment
Anticipating all the things you'll do to me
Make the first step to release my emotions
To take the road to ecstacy

You gotta go downtown
That's the way to my love (You know my way)
Take it round and round (Oh)
Oooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love (Oh)
Go downtown, (O-Oooh)
To taste the sweetness will be enough (That's the key the key now)
That's the love that you've been dreaming of (Yeah)
