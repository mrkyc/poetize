This time last year, I was feeling so alone
I never thought that you would come along
You changed my whole world
Now all I have is memories
My lonely days are gone
You changed the right from wrong
And I never

Never thought I'd find love (Oh)
'Til the day I found you, sugar (I never had no one)
Never had no one to hold me like this (Like this, like this, like this)
No, no, no
Never thought I'd find love (Oh)
'Til the day I found you, sugar (I never had no one)
Never had no one to hold me like this (Like this)

I never imagined just what it would be like
To have this feeling that I feel
Without you in my life
It's like a day of sunshine after days of cloudy skies
And when you held me in your arms
You opened up my eyes

And I'll tell the world that I'm in love (I, yeah, yeah)
And it feels so good to know
You're the one that I adore
Every day (Every day and night) you love me right
I don't want to trade it for nothing in this world
I never

Never thought I'd find love (Until the day)

And watch these lips go dead between your lips, uh
While my niggas (Uh) be spazzin' out, I'm blowin' back spasms out
Your leather, my house

It's now or never, my tongue in your mouth

Only bonin' girls with nice figures, ridin' dat digga

Who you wanna be with, who you creep with (What?)
