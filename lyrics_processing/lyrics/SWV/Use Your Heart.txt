Alone
You and I intertwine
Refreshing conversation for the mind
As we stare
We both seek and hope to find
Real love purified

Use your heart and not your eyes
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time
(Yeah, yeah)
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes
(Baby)

I sigh as I watch you sleeping there (Sleeping there)
So easily I did things I'd never dare (Never dare)
I say to myself, "I'm glad that we share
Real love purified", oh

Use your heart and not your eyes
(Use your heart and not your eyes, baby)
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time (Yeah, yeah)
(If you got time then I got time)
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

My goodness, how it seems like yesterday (Yesterday)
She crossed you hurt you in the strongest way (Strongest way)
You've hurt so long, reward come to those who cry
Real love purified

Just a second
I look at my watch's dial
And you love me, pampered me like a child
As we lay, I close my eyes and I smile
At your real love purified

Use your heart and not your eyes
(Oh, baby)
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time (Yeah, yeah)
(If you got the time, then I got the time)
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
(Baby, won't you use your heart)
Use your heart and not your eyes (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Use your heart and not your eyes (Use your heart, baby)
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time (Yeah, yeah)
(So that they can see what is destiny for you)
Free your thoughts and watch them fly (Ooh baby)
Use your heart and not your eyes (Use your heart)
Use your heart and not your eyes

Baby, just relax and ride (Relax and ride)

Free your thoughts and watch them fly
