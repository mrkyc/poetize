What is love?
Love is an experience everyone should have
It's not always fun, but it's always special
A sweet struggle that seals the past and builds the future
A love that can never strike is an amazing love

Tell me why is love the way it is?
Joy and pain is all in the game of love
I don't know, it's hard to say
But who am I to blame?
Love is so amazing, amazing

How many heartaches does it take till this girl becomes woman?
How many tears must I cry till my heart mends?
But as much as I try to get over it, my heart calls for you
Why is love this way?
Does it have to be this way?

So tell me, why? (Why?)
Is it me? (Is it me or you?)
Or is this how (I often wonder)
Love should be? (Love is so amazing)
