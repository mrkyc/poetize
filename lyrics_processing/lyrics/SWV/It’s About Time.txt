It's been too long, baby (It's been too long)

It's been a week since I last saw you
Over and over I imagine all the things I'm gonna do
Soon it'll be time for this fantasy to come true
I got something special I want to try on you
First we kiss, then relax, while I bring you some wine
Take off your shoes, get ready for a real good time
The night is young and I belong to you
So let's get started, we've got some lovin' to do

It's about time (It's about time) for us (For us to get together)
Maybe, maybe tonight (Oh, it's time)
It's about time (For us) for us (To get together)
Maybe (Mhm)

Every time you love me, it's like never before
And that just makes me wanna keep giving, giving you more
I'm gonna be, mm, the best I can be
'Cause I know that you're gonna do your best for me
There's nothing better than the way you're making me feel
Nothing could be so good, nothing could be so real
So let's get lovin' like this all night long
Makin' up all the time that you been gone
