I need someone who I can share all my dreams with
That's what I need
Someone special who will love me just for me
That's what I need
I need someone to hold me tight
To give good lovin' all night
So many times I've opened up my heart
Only to have someone tear it apart
That's why I need

Someone to treat me right
Make love all through the night
That's what I need (Boy, I've been hurt before)
I've been hurt before
Real love I'm looking for
That's what I need

I need someone who will never leave me lonely
That's what I need
Someone faithful to love me as their one and only
That's what I need
I need someone to share my ups and downs
And even through the bad times will always be around
So many times I've opened up my heart
Only to have someone tear it apart
I need
