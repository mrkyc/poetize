Won't you tell me
What's on your mind
Are we moving forward
Or are we, wasting time?
Just when I think I have it
Thoughts slipping through my head
Are we for real?
What should I feel?
Help me understand

'Cause deep in my heart
I imagine you and me
Sharing true love
I need to know
Tell me now
Is it just a fantasy? Oh

Tell me how you want it (Tell me)
Do you want to do it right? (Do it right)
Or do you, only want it for one night
Tell me how you want it (How do you want i?)
We can make it any way you like (Oh)
But I hope it's for the rest of our lives

Oh, there was a time
Somewhere in my past
When my heart went
Too far and too fast for love to last
So, before we go even one kiss further
Should I stay? Should i go?
I need to know
I've got to be sure

'Cause deep in my heart
I'm looking for you
To show me a sign
That love is real and that you
Feel this way too
I'm praying you do

Tell me how you want it (Tell me)
Do you want to do it right? (Do it right)
Or do you (Or do you), only want it for one night?
(Come on and tell me)
Tell me how you want it (How do you want it?)
We can make it any way you like
But I hope (I hope) it's for the rest of our lives
You make it so easy for me to fall in love
Is it just an illusion
Or something I can trust?
Wanna make the right descision
Don't wanna leave it to chance
Baby, are we for real?
What should I feel?
Help me understand
