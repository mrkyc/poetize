Boy, I want you to listen closely to what I have to say
'Cause this is the way to my heart
Ooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love
That's the love that you've been dreaming of (Don't stop)
You can't stop 'til you find my love
That's the love that you've been dreaming of

You've been wondering how you can make it better
Baby, it's easy to turn my world inside out
Your discovery will take us to another place
Baby, on that, there is no doubt
I've been waiting for the special moment (For the special moment)
Anticipating all the things you'll do to me
Make the first step to release my emotions
To take the road to ecstasy

You gotta go downtown

Take it 'round and 'round
Ooh, you can't stop 'til you find my love
Go downtown
To taste the sweetness will be enough
That's the love that you've been dreaming of
