There's no love I know
Greater than your love, baby, for sure, ooh
And I've searched far and wide
And the stars above
But no love endures
So, please, return your love to me
You know that we should be together
In love forever
You are the one that I need

You are my love
And I need you here to love me
I need you here, I swear
You are my love
And I want you here to warm me
I'll always need you there

There's no pain I know
Like the pain I feel, feel in my heart
And I have cried, Lord knows I've cried
But I still have the will
I hope you're not far, oh
If you could only hear the words
I'm sorry that I hurt you, baby
I must been crazy
Come back wherever you are

There's a certain amount of love I need
I'll never give up till you're here with me
Lord knows you're all I'm longing for
Hmm, you see I never knew how much in love I was
I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done
(All the wrong I've done, forgive me, you)
Forgive me baby, you are the only one

You are my love
And I need you here to love me
I need you here, I swear
You are my love
And I want you here to warm me (Yes, I do, yes, I do)
