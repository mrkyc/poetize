Just cause I don't wake up with a bottle
And my blood don't know the fire of cocaine
Just cause my skin don't know the sting of a needle
That don't mean that I don't know the pain

Cause I've taken hits, woke up hungover
Gone on benders, stone cold sober
Slammed the door right off the hinges
Hotel rooms and midnight binges
Wrecked my life, had too much
Of things I swore I'd never touch
So don't tell me I've never done the hard stuff
Cause I've done love
I've done love

I don't get my fix in some back alley
My tongue still knows the taste of ecstasy
We're all on the road to chasing happy
But it ain't a thrill inside a pill that makes a junkie out of me

Cause I've taken hits, woke up hungover
Gone on benders, stone cold sober
Slammed the door right off the hinges
Hotel rooms and midnight binges
Wrecked my life, had too much
Of things I swore I'd never touch
So don't tell me I've never done the hard stuff
Cause I've done love
Yeah I've done love
You might also like
Love, love what I need
Up so high but on my knees
In the dark and on the street
I've done love, or has it done me?
Love, love, what I need
Up so high but on my knees
In the dark and on the street
I've done love, or has it done me?

I've taken hits, woke up hungover
On a bender, stone cold sober
Slammed the door right off the hinges
Hotel rooms and midnight binges
I touched the sky, I had it all
I had too much, I had withdrawal
So don't tell me I've never done the hard stuff
Cause I've done love
I've done love

Love, love what I need
Up so high but on my knees
In the dark and on the street
