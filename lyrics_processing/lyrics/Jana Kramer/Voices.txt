I am strong, I am beautiful
The girl I used to be
She was confident and free and happy
I don't recognize myself
Or this person in the mirror staring back at me

I'm fighting voices in my head
Voices in my head telling me that I'm not enough
I'm not pretty and I'm broken, I'm not worthy of love
Voices in my head telling me that I should give up
I'm fighting voices in my head, oh
I'm fighting voices in my head, oh

Words, they can cut so deep
Why do I care so much what people think?
I wonder who I'd be if I didn't have insecurity
I don't know what to think
I'm losing all control of reality

I'm fighting voices in my head
Voices in my head telling me that I'm not enough
I'm not pretty and I'm broken, I'm not worthy of love
Voices in my head telling me that I should give up
I'm fighting voices in my head, oh
(Voices in my head, voices in my head)
I'm fighting voices in my head, oh
(Voices in my head, voices in my head)

Stop it, I can't take another minute
I'm going crazy with these voices that are spinning in my head
Tell my head to listen to my heart, and my heart says

I'm done with voices in my head
Voices in my head, I know that I am enough
I am pretty, I'm not broken, I am worthy of love
Voices in my head I know that it's time to give up
With all these voices in my head
(Voices in my head)
Voices in my head
(Voices in my head)

I'm worthy of love
(Voices in my head)
It's time to give up
(Voices in my head)
