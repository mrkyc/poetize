My baby, he don't talk sweet
He ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway
And maybe he don't dress fine
But I don't really mind

'Cause every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer

Let's hear it for the boy
Oh, let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Oh, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Let's hear it for the boy

My baby may not be rich
He's watching every dime
Ooh, but he loves me, loves me, loves me
We always have a real good time
And maybe he sings off-key
But that's all right by me, yeah
You might also like
'Cause what he does, he does so well
Makes me wanna yell

Let's hear it for the boy
Oh, let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Oh, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Let's hear it for the boy

'Cause every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer

Let's hear it for the boy
Oh, let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Oh, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Let's hear it for the boy
(Let's hear it for the boy)
Let's hear it for my man
(Let's hear it for my baby)
Let's hear it for my baby
(Let's hear it for the boy)
I'm your biggest fan
(Let's hear it for my baby)
Put your hands together
(Let's hear it for the boy)
Just watch my baby dance
(Let's hear it for my baby)
Oh, he's my dancing man
(Let's hear it for the boy)
C'mon, and clap your hands
(Let's hear it for my baby)
Yeah, watch my baby dance
