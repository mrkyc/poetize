Never wanna be the president
Never wanna be the one that answers for you all
Don't wanna set the precedent
Don't wanna be the one taking all them calls
I ain't buying, this ain't who we are
But I know nothing comes for free

What if kindness was the currency?
Then we might just start to finally see
The way that God intended us to be
What if a smile was worth a million bucks
And a warm hug got you a brand new truck
Just think about how great our lives would be
We'd be rich and we'd be happy
We'd be easy, we'd be laughing
Yeah, you'll see
If kindness was the currency

It's so easy to forget
How a simple wave can make someone's day
And Luke 6:35 says that when we love all we'll be great
Let's all come together, let's all do our part
We know this world is better when we lead with our hearts
