I never knew that we could speak without talking
Some strange and wonderful feelings, girl, has happened to me
It's so hard to explain but I know that it's real
I never knew that we could feel without touching
I never knew that we could speak without talking
Just thinking about you alone in my room
But I feel your love it's surrounding me
Everywhere I go I take you with me
We share one soul where you live in me
Especially at night I feel so close to you
Thoughts of you ease my mind, go to sleep
I never knew that we could feel without touching
I never knew that we could speak without talking
And when I'm with you, there's no need for words
You look through my eyes and read my mind
Rainbows fade away, the sun goes down sometimes
Falling star is well, heavens are aside
But it's your voice I hear, whispering to me
You're always there, you're the end that I'll breathe
You might also likeI never knew
Maybe you should tell me
You should tell me
I never knew that we could feel without touching
I never knew that we could speak without talking
Some strange and wonderful feelings, girl, has happened to me
It's so hard to explain but I know that it's real
I never knew that we could feel without touching
I never knew that we could speak without talking
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew
I never knew that we could feel without touching
Speak without talking, I never knew that we could feel without touching
Feel without touching, I never knew that we could speak without talking
Speak without talking, I never knew that we could feel without touching
Feel without touching, I never knew that we could speak without talking
