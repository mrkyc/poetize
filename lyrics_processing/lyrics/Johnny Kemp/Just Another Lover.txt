I remain yours exclusively
And though I never want to tie you down
I'm into private property
(I'm leaving you 'till you do decide)
I wanna be the only one
(Hoping that you'll be only mine)
'Cause I don't wanna be
(Just another lover)
Tell me girl I wanna know you I turn you on
Am I just another lover
Say I'm like no other
I wanna be your number one
We started out so casual
You didn't take it serious
But in my heart and in my soul
It's always been the two of us
So we give that question to me
You know that you're the only one
Brought with me into ecstasy
Oh, so I don't have to be
(Just another lover)
Just another lover
The girl I want to know do I turn you on
Am I just another lover?
You say you're like no other
I wanna be your number one
(Just another lover)
Just another lover
That I'm just another lover do I turn you on
Am I just another lover?
You say you're like no other
I wanna be your only one
You might also likeI wanna be the only one
'Cause girl you know you're number one
I know that I'm the only one
And boy I know you're number one
You're number one
(I'm leaving you 'till you do decide)
I wanna be your only one
(Hoping that you'll be only mine)
Babe, 'cause I don't wanna be
(Just another lover)
