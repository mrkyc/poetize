Brother Pele's in the back, sweet Sina's in the front
Cruising down the freeway in the hot, hot sun
Suddenly red-blue lights flash us from behind
Loud voice booming, "Please step out onto the line"
Pele preaches words of comfort, Sina just hides her eyes
Policeman taps his shades, "Is that a Chevy '69?"

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Destination unknown as we pull in for some gas
A freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Elephants and acrobats, lions, snakes, monkey
Pele speaks "righteous," Sister Sina says, "funky"

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face

Ringmaster steps out, says, "The elephants left town"
People jump and jive and the clowns have stuck around
TV news and cameras, there's choppers in the sky
Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why
Pele yells, "We're out of here," Sina says, "Right on"
Making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone
Jumped into the Chevy, headed for big lights
Wanna know the rest? Hey, buy the rights

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face
It's in my face
