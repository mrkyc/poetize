Liquor in a brown bag, stopped by the Quick Sack
'Bout to go missing like cans in a twelve pack
Little bitty hillbilly, swerving like Jones
Small town blue lights take your ass home
Daddy didn't raise no quitter
'Bout to take this sumbitch to the river

Talkin' 'bout catfish, talkin' 'bout trout line
Yeah, back home, talkin' 'bout moonshine
Talkin' backwoods in the backwoods, back forty
A cold beer will do it for me
I can tell you 'bout fishin', little bit of huntin'
I can tell you how to get an old John Deere runnin'
Sure as country and Jesus a-comin' back
Can't tell you 'bout much, but I damn sure can tell you 'bout that
Tell you 'bout that

Got a gun in the back seat granddaddy gave me
You can thank God, 'cause that's how he made me
Little bit of western, little down home
Whole lotta hillbilly in these bones

Talkin' 'bout catfish, talkin' 'bout trout line
Yeah, back home, talkin' 'bout moonshine
Talkin' backwoods in the backwoods, back forty
A cold beer will do it for me
I can tell you 'bout fishin', little bit of huntin'
I can tell you how to get an old John Deere runnin'
Sure as country and Jesus a-comin' back
Can't tell you 'bout much, but I damn sure can tell you 'bout that
Can tell you 'bout that
