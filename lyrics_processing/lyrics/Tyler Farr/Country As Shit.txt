This one's for the ones who been livin' off blocks
With the dogs on the porch 'cause the doors don't lock
Gotta boat in the back with a trailer as a dock
On that same piece of land Daddy's granddaddy bought

Might seem a little different (Never change)
But it's our kinda livin' (Southern twang)
Don't expect you to get it (Jelly and T-Farr)
And if you don't we don't give a damn (Let's go)

'Round here our trucks stay muddy
Out here our cooler's loaded down
Ain't scared to knuckle up buddy
You better think twice 'fore you run that mouth
What you see is what you get and
What you get is what it is
Livin' like Willie and Waylon and No Show did
Keepin' it country as shit

Yeah fishin' ain't the only thing that we do in the dark
We pull over, hit the shoulder, and put that puppy in park
Got the windows rolled up
That light is about to spark
Yeah, that loud howlin' dog let them tires start to bark

'Round here our trucks stay muddy (Dirty, baby)
Out here our cooler's loaded down (Ice cold)
Ain't scared to knuckle up buddy (Never)
You better think twice 'fore you run that mouth (They don't want to know)
What you see is what you get and
What you get is what it is (Is what it is)
Livin' like Willie and Waylon and No Show did (Jones, baby)
Keepin' it country as shit
Yeah, baby

Might seem a little different
Never change
But it's our kinda livin' (Southern twang)
Don't expect you to get it
And if you don't we don't give a damn (Let's go)

Livin' like Willie and Waylon and No Show did (Jones, baby)
Keepin' it country as shit
I will not apologize
You know just what you get
Come and take a look where I live
We damn sure country as shit
Back woods ballin' I'm never callin' it quits
Breakin' bottles and holler swaller and spit
