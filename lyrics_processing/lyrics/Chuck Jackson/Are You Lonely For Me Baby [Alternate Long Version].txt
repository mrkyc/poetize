Last train to Jacksonville
I'm gonna get on it, baby, you know I will
Will you try, come on and try
To forget all the pain I've brought you?
Go on and cry, go ahead and cry, baby
I know I'm the one who taught you
To be lonely, baby, lonely and blue
I'm lonely, baby, I'm lonely for you

(Are you lonely for me, baby?) Yes I am
(Are you lonely for me, baby?) Oh, it's my

Last buck to Jacksonville
Are you my sweet baby, are you still?
Tell your friend it's the end
I will never again desert you
He will laugh, I can hear him laughin' baby
He'll say I was wrong to hurt you
Oh, I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry and blue
I'm lonely, baby, I'm lonely for you
Oh, lonely, baby

Hey
It's a long ride to Jacksonville
No one will ever know the way I feel
Will you be there, will you be there
When I when I get off the train girl?
You see, you gotta be there, you just gotta be there
I just got to see you again
'Cause I'm lonely, baby, I'm lonely and blue
I'm lonely, baby, I'm lonely for you

(Are you lonely for me, baby?) Yes I am
