I thought "How lucky could I be?"
Of all the guys in the world
You chose me, you chose me
And as I wipe my happy crying eyes
Suddenly, I realize
I can't go on without you (Everything little thing about you)
'Cause there's so many things I like about you (Tell me that I like you, I like you)
Listen, darling
I like the way you please me
By telling me that you need me
I like it, as a matter of fact (Everything little thing about you)
I like, every little thing about you (Tell me that I like you, I like you)
Yes, I do
Every little thing about you (Every little thing about you, I like it)
Everything about you (Every little thing about you, I like it)
I like it, I like it (Every little thing about you)
Every little thing about you (Tell me that I like it, I like it)
And darling, listen to me
Just the little things you do, Girl
That make me feel in a better world
It's hard to explain, but I do, Girl
I can't stop sayin' Listen
You might also likeI like the way you hold my hand
To let me know that you understand
I like it, as a matter of fact (Everything little thing about you)
I like, every little thing about you (Tell me that I like you, I like you)
Listen, darling
I like the way you call my name
Soft and low, sweet and plain
I like it, (Everything little thing about you)
I like every little thing about you (Tell me that I like you, I like you)
Here's another thing I wanna tell the world
When the loneliness is hard to bear
I don't worry 'cause I know you're standing there
To dry my tear, wipe away my fears!
You see why I like so many things about you?
Listen
Every little thing about you (Every little thing about you, I like it)
Everything about you (Every little thing about you, I like it)
Baby, I like it, I like it (Every little thing about you)
Every little thing about you (Tell me that I like it, I like it)
You don't understand but listen
Everything about you, Darling
Everything about you
