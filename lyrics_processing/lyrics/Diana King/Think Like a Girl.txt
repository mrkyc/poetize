If only them could think like a girl
If you could think like a girl
It would a be such a perfect world
If you could think like a girl
It don't tek too much, fi please a man
But as a woman mi harder fi understand
A girl she needs affection
A man he needs direction
If I an I say black, mi ago get white
You give mi a minute when mi want it
All night
A girl she needs emotion
A man's a locomotion
If you could think like a girl
It would a be such a perfect world
If you could think like a girl
If you could only think like a girl
If you could think like a girl
It would a be such a perfect world
If you could think like a girl
Mi no wah yu fi hear u hafi listen to me
Pay attention try fi love differently
A girl she needs a best friend
A man needs television
U hafi light a candle a pour di wine
Touch mi badi likkle bwoy tek yu time
Baby you can slow down
Maybe you can go down

If you could think like a girl
It would a be such a perfect world
If you could think like a girl
If you could only think like a girl
If you could think like a girl
It would a be such a perfect world
If you could think like a girl
Boys will be boys will be boys will be boys

And the boy say sex me, and the girl say know me
And the boy say want me, and the girl says need me
And the boy say, and the girl say
And the boy, the girl the boy, the girl.....
If you could think like a girl
