So we creep and we sneak and we try not to let it show
But we just can't let it go
The woman I call my love she belong to my best friend
No matter what I do or try I can't solve the problem
Sneak every night, hug up so tight
Da minute I saw your body and da minute I saw your face
Da way you look so hot when you step up ina de place
Oh what a guy, what a vibe
The feeling could not be denied
Understand, we say we can't understand
How did we end up in this situation
If the people them knew, it woulda bring a bam-bam
What a big bang-ga-rang

Keep it on the down low, can't let nobody know
So we creep and we sneak and we try not to let it show
Keep it on the down low, an' so we stay and so we flow
We try and we try but we just can't let it go
Undercover lovers, we are undercover lovers
We do it in the Benz and then we do it in the shower
Gotta watch the time and we gotta watch the hour
Fight a go broke out when the people dem discover
I cherish every moment, every touch an' every kiss
I never ever sexperience nothing like this
Emotions like this, you coulda never dismiss
And we could never resist
You might also like
Keep it on the down low, can't let nobody know
So we creep and we sneak and we try not to let it show
Keep it on the down low, an' so we stay and so we flow
We try and we try but we just can't let it go
Don'tcha, don'tcha think it's gonna be, big drama
Him come home early and catch we, big drama
Doing the freaky-freaky, freaky, big drama
(Oh no) it's like we're living in a soap opera
