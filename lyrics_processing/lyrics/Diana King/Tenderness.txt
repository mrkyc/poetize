At the end of the day
Is all a woman needs, to take her fears away
Cold, cold di world so cold
Mi waash someone to have and to hold
Ina di nite, when di feelings a bite
Hug mi up, squeeze mi up mek mi feel right
Forget di problems, everybody have dem
Tonight mi just naah feature dem
I, just wanna lay with you
And be an island in this sea of confusion
Just a little tenderness
At the end of the day
Is all a woman needs, to take her fears away
Just a little tenderness
With the lights down low
When the world is just two people
And love is all we need to know
Everybody got an idea
Of what's right, what's right for me
I'm just tryin' to survive and
Live my life peacefully
This one wants to educate me
This one wants to dominate me
The other one's tryin' to wear me down
Talkin' outta both sides of the mouth, oh
I, just wanna lay with you
And be an island in this sea of confusion
