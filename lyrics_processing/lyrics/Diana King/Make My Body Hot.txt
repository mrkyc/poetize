It takes me places I've never been without even touching me
The way you move your body, babe
Sends a tingling sensation through my body so tempting;
I don't want to let you in
I like what you're doing to me
But it's just a bit too much for now
I'm telling you, you better stop or else
You're gonna make my body hot
Boy, you make me want to give it up
I think of you inside, my love, and I think I've got to loosen up
But boy, you're gonna make my body hot
Don't you do that to me. Don't you do that to me
All the signals you have sent me
Help me set my feelings free
Got me feeling so irate
Ooh, free and irate
Scared I might make a mistake;
I don't want my poor heart to break
Then again, it might be too late for me to get away
I like what you're doing to me
But it's just a bit too much for now
I'm telling you, you better stop or else
You're gonna make my body hot
Boy, you make me want to give it up
I think of you inside, my love, and I think I've got to loosen up
But boy, you're gonna make my body hot
You might also likeDon't you do that to me
Is it emotional?
I am wanting you so much
Or is it physical?
Boy, I hunger for your touch
Is it sexual?
Boy, I'm curious 'bout that
I really need to know how you make my body so hot
You make my body so hot, now
You make my body so hot
You make my body so hot, now
I like what you're doing to me
But it's just a bit too much for now
I'm telling you, you better stop or else
You're gonna make my body hot
Boy, you make me want to give it up
I think of you inside, my love, and I think I've got to loosen up
But boy, you're gonna make my body hot
Tingling sensation, yes
Ta-temptation
