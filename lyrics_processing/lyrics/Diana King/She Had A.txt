Lookin' like his very own Shangri-La
He could feel his heart go tick a tick tock
Say what, say what, say what
She had a body like you see on TV
Not the type a girl u would usually meet
She was every schoolboy's liquid dream
A sex machine
Funny, funny
Thought he had a Playboy bunny
Thought he was getting lucky, luck
But when he got uo in between
He couldn't believe..

She had a something
Where there shoulda been nothing
One thing
He wasn't expecting
She was so beautiful
It was so unusual
She had a...
She had a something
In the way she was walking
Shoulda known
The way she was talking
She was so beautiful
He was gonna do her but
She had a, she had a, she had a something
You might also likeThere he was
Thinking that it's gotta be the coke and rum
But he'd explode if he didn't get some
He could feel his heart just beating like a drum
Ta-dum, ta-dum, ta-dum
Hypnotizing him with her voodoo
So he took her back to his one-bedroom
Ready like Freddy to get back ina de groove
To make the move, the move, the move
Hit it, hit it
Thought that he was gonna get it
Tried ta put his finger in it
But when he got up in between
He couldn't believe...

She had a something
Where there shoulda been nothing

She had a something
In the way she was walking
Shoulda known
The way she was talking
She was so beautiful
He was gonna do her but
She had a, she had a, she had a something
Said her name was Kitty Meow
Thought he knew what she was about
Should she stay or get out
'Cause when he got up in between
He couldn't believe...
