Just play me in a stereo...
(summer breezin') yeah man, summertime (summer breezin')
So, I call Michelle up on the cell:
"Bring a naughty bikini and nothing else
We're going to the beach; take the top off the jeep
And bring Chantel as well"
And the boys upstairs wanna come
But they remind me of dumber and dumb
Oh lard (?) 'bout da kids so turn the car key
Gonna hop a lech fun in the sun
(summer breezin') mmmm, everywhere I go everybody I know is kissin' on the beach and fizzin' on the streets and looking for a love so sweet
(summer breezin') mmmm, I'm just chillin' in the sun with mi chocolate bun
Oh I got a lover, but I might find another if I drink enough of tequila
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
Bounty Killer is there an' everybody's starin'
Checkin' out the bling bling ba ling we're wearin'
Strolling down the boardwalk kickin' all the boy talk, well
I feel like that song by Bobby McFerrin
No worries coz everything cool
Nno school, no rules, just jump in the pool
G-strings and jerk chicken wings these are the things that summertime brings
G-strings and jerk chicken wings these are the things that summertime brings
G-strings and jerk chicken wings these are the things that summertime brings
(Hits and summer swing)

Girls skinnydipping, number one stop teasing
I wish it was summer for the world four season
Summertime is here for a jolly good reason
Diana it is summer, drop the top form your ????
Chantel and Michelle get ???, I'm the number one stunner
All the birds wanna ??? I got this thing bangin' like a drummer
(Summer swing)
"Oops, what time is it?"
Six forty five and sun is arisin'
Me and Michelle and Chantel feel like hell
I'm gonna sleep 'till two and call up my crew and do it all over again
