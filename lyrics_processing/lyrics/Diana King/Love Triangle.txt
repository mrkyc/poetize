Have you ever been in love with a man
Have you ever been in love with a man, and another man
Ever been in love with a man
Have you ever been in love with a man, and another man

Where do I begin
Two people just friends
Feeling more and more, that's not where this love story ends
The situation's strong
But then another came along
Innocent enough but suddenly it all went wrong

Han pan mi jaw mia wonda
Weh mia guh duh when di two a dem discova
All dis time mi did have anada lova
Between di three a we mi dida keep it undacova

I got so confused
I don't know what to do
My mind tells me to stay but my heart wants somebody new
I gotta do what's right
I can barely sleep at night
When one speaks of love I see the other in his eyes
Mek up mi mind mi haffi mek up mi mind
Cyan't keep two even tho mi dida try
How it happen? People don't ask mi why
But mi hafi tell di truth an mi cyan't tell no lie
