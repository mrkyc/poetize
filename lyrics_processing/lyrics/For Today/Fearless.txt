We will not, we will not
We will not be afraid
We will not, we will not
We will not be afraid
We will not, we will not
We will not be afraid
We will not, we will not
We will not
We are fearless
Fearless

We bear the mark of the uncreated God
So what should we fear?
We bear the scars of the holy risen Son
So tell me what should we fear?
Every threat is hollow
Because our victory is already set in stone
We are the fearless ones

We will not, we will not
We will not be afraid
We will not, we will not
We will not be afraid

Though we stand in this dark valley (We will not be afraid)
For we know that you are near
Though we stand in this dark valley (We will not be afraid)
For we know that you are near (You are near)

I can feel the courage rising
In the hearts of the sons of God
I can feel a fire burning
Across the Earth we stand as one
We are not dismayed by the darkness that surrounds us here
Because we know that when all hell closes in
If we stand and fight, we are not alone!
Though we walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death (We are not alone)
We will fear no evil
For you are near
We are the fearless ones

We will not, we will not
We will not be afraid
We will not, we will not
We will not be afraid
Though we stand in this dark valley (We will not be afraid)
For we know that you are near
Though we stand in this dark valley (We will not be afraid)
For we know that you are near (You are near)

He can't stop the kingdom
You'll see him bow at the throne on judgment day
So let the devil come
We are fearless
Fearless
