I will never bow down to your idols
I know who I am
You'll have to put me in the ground to silence me
This is my final stand!

You can't kill me, I'm already dead
This is the martyr's cry
So as the crowd demands my head
My time has come to die
You can't kill me, I'm already dead
This is the martyr's cry
So as the crowd demands my head
My time has come to die

Death is only the beginning of everything I'm living for
This is my final stand
Laid upon the altar, this is my final stand
Laid upon the altar, this is my final stand
Stand up, my convictions are not for sale
And I know who I am
They can't deny the truth inside me
So I will suffer at their hands
Dragged through the streets like a criminal
By my own flesh and blood
Guilty by association
There is hell to pay for this apostate son
You might also likeKill him! The self-righteous scream
He serves a new king
Kill him! Their blind eyes can't see
I serve the true King
Now the rocks start flying and my mouth it fills with blood
I can hear my mother crying but one voice is not enough!
I was facing the full wrath of hell (Feeble as it is)
I was facing a good death as well (This is glorious)
Face to face with the grave I was waiting for
And my killers were face to face
With a faith that they can't ignore
This is my final stand
I will never bow down to your idols
I know who I am
You'll have to put me in the ground to silence me
This is my final stand

You can't kill me, I'm already dead
This is the martyr's cry
So as the crowd demands my head
My time has come to die
You can't kill me, I'm already dead
This is the martyr's cry
So as the crowd demands my head
