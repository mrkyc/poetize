Lord of Glory, make us worthy to possess Your Name
And give us a new name
And call us your people, God
Give us a new name
(I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. You will live in the land I gave to your forefathers; you will be my people and I will be your God.)
Lord of Glory, make us worthy to possess Your Name
Lord of Glory, make us worthy to possess Your Name
And give us a new name
And call us your people, God
Give us a new name
(And through all of this, there is nothing, absolutely nothing
No fear, no insecurity, no doubt, no hesitation that will ever, ever stop us
Because we are the sons of the living God
Because we are the children of the Almighty
Because we are the residents of the Kingdom of Heaven
And we are soldiers in an army of the immortal
And when we speak life, life happens
And when we speak healing, healing happens
And when we speak truth, truth happens
And when we go and take what we have found to a dead world, we'll see it come to life again
And when we take what we have found to a hopeless world, we'll see hope come back
We'll see the heart of our world start beating again
And we'll see the color come back into people's faces
And absolutely nothing will ever stop that
And mountains will move before us
And oceans will part before us
And the dead will raise before us
And the world will know that our God is a god that heals
That our God is a god that lives
And our God is a god that loves unlike anything anyone has ever felt before
Because we are fearless
Because we are His hands
And because we are His feet forever and ever)
