You see my blood and sweat and tears
I have poured on the ground before you
Take everything
Blood and sweat and tears
You have poured on the ground before me
When you gave everything

I have lived this war too long
Come and take everything
I have lived in sin too long
Come and take everything
I release it all, finally
Finally!

Finally, I surrender
All to you, I give it all to you
Finally, I surrender
All I am, I owe it all to you
Finally, I surrender
All to you, I give it all to you
Finally, I surrender
All I am, I owe it all

You fight for me when I can't fight for myself
This battle is not mine, but the battle belongs to the Lord
This battle is not mine, but the battle belongs to the Lord
I am no slave unto this broken flesh, because you gave me hope
I am no slave unto this broken flesh, because you are my hope
I am no slave to my flesh (That man has died)
I am a free man!
I am a free man!

Under the blood, I rise
Redeemed, I stand
Carried back from hell by your nail-scarred hands
And now I'm free
You broke my chains and you gave me the key
Redeemed, I stand
Carried back from hell by your nail-scarred hands
And now I'm free
You broke my chains and you gave me the key
So now I bow to show you, that you are everything to me

Finally, I surrender
All to you, I give it all to you
Finally, I surrender
All I am, I owe it all to you
Finally, I surrender
All to you, I give it all to you
Finally, I surrender
