What have we done
What have we begun
A broken mirror reflecting only darkness
Disrupted vision
And closed off hearts
We turn our face away from those we're sent to love
But now I hear your voice calling me back home
It isn't over yet
Bringing hope into our hopelessness
Turning hearts from stone to flesh
In a world headed for self-destruction
The answer is here; are we too blind to see it?
In a world headed for self-destruction
The answer is here; are we too blind to see it?
It's the blind, leading the blind, leading the blind to their demise
It's the blind, leading the blind, leading the blind to their demise
Break the cycle!
Break the cycle!
Break the cycle!

Self-destruction has tainted our way of life
It's time to break the cycle
In the darkness of fear, there's a dawning light
It's time to break the cycle
We stumble around and fall to the ground
But are we too proud to reach out
To reach for a hand that can help us to stand
And keep us from falling facedown?
We're only helpless, because we're heartless

There is hope in the blood!

Rise up, there's a new day dawning
We'll see the darkness flee
Rise up, there's a new day dawning
In which the blind will see!
I see a light in the darkness, rising in the night
I see a light in the darkness, in the sons of light

Bring this broken system to its knees!
Bring this broken system to its knees!
Break the cycle! Break the cycle!
We're only helpless, because we're heartless
