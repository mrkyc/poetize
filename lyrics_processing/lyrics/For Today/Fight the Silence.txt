But still we don't see them, we look away
Still they cry, but no one is listening
When will we open our eyes?
Open our eyes!
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we hear their cries?
This song we sing to silence the suffering
When will we open our eyes?
So let the world listen closely
As I scream to see the freedom they deserve
Let the world listen closely!
I say it's time to cross the lines our culture's blurred
Preying on poverty, they keep us uninformed and distracted
If they can't fight for themselves, we'll fight for them
It's time to fight the silence!
Broken, abused, and exploited
For the sick satisfaction of selfish men
Only a coward would try to ignore it
We can raise our voice and bring it to an end
Fight! Fight! Fight the silence!
Set the captives free!
Fight! Fight! Fight the silence!
They're a slave to a system of apathy
Bought and sold, their right to life has been taken away
Bought and sold, (Let's) bring an end to slavery
Open our eyes!

Their fate is in our hands
Will they be left there to suffer or will somebody take a stand
Against a system that's been designed to deny
Its victims their right to life?
Let's set the captives free!
When all is said and done, we'll see justice come
It's time to fight the silence
The voice of the voiceless
Fight the silence!
We are the hope for the hopeless
Fight the silence!
Fight! Fight! Fight the silence!
