The hardest hearts break in surrender
And heaven conquers once again
So I lay down my life for the world to see
That there was only One who could break the chains that bound me
Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man
My King is alive! My King is alive!
Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man
My King is alive! My King is alive!
And He is worthy of everything
I know I'm not the only one who felt the hands of death
But I have found the only One who can restore this life
I... I am convinced He can save you
Because I was once in need of a savior
"If an individual loves God supremely, he will be as conscious that he lives for God as that he lives at all." - Keith Green
So, in this moment I declare, for the lost and the hopeless:
Deliverer, deliver us
Deliverer, deliver us
Deliverer, deliver us
Deliverer, deliver us
Deliverer, deliver us
Deliverer, deliver us. Auh....

Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man
My King is alive! My King is alive!
Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man
My King is alive! My King is alive!
And I will hold fast to the profession of my hope
Because He who promised is faithful
(My King is alive! My King is alive!)
Time and time again, in my weakness
He's been strong for me
I've not just heard about Him, I've heard Him
I've not just seen evidence of Him, I've seen Him
(My King is alive! My King is alive!)
He's alive, and He's conquered the grave once and for all
