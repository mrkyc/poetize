I see the dawning of a movement of the kids who won't concede
To a culture of deception; and a spark is all we need
I see the dawning of a movement of the kids who won't concede
To a culture of deception; and a spark is all we need
To see a revolution in a culture that's living a lie
Still, this is our generation, and still, we will not watch it die
Out in the streets we run, with the fire of conviction
And we let it shine
We burn every structure down, that stands for our destruction
Liberate your mind!
And we will always believe:
They can see our banner waving high, so let your fire burn tonight
And as the city sleeps, in the empty streets, there's a flame lighting up the sky!
There is a system designed to destroy us
We'll send it back to hell!
I'll watch it burn to the ground
Burn it down!
I'll watch it burn to the ground;
And freedom will rise from the ashes
Burn it down!
I see the dawning of a movement of the kids who won't concede
To a culture of deception; and a spark is all we need
I see the dawning of a movement of the kids who won't concede
To a culture of deception; and a spark is all we need
To see a revolution in a culture that's living a lie
Still, this is our generation, and still, we will not watch it die
