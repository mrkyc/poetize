This is a song for the fallen, I see you rising again!
Only a coward would run away
Looking for freedom, you only found regret
Only a coward would run away
Leave your past behind you, there is hope ahead!

I see you writhing in pain from all the hell that you've seen
You left it all for a life that never satisfied you
Unloved by the world you lost it all to conform to
There's still hope in the voice that's crying out inside you
If you can hear it, you still have time

Come back to your home, and all you're running from
I'm begging you to come back to your home, and all you're running from
I'm begging you to come back

"You are not what you've done, and this is not who you are
No matter how far you run, you have not gone too far
You are not what you've done, and this is not who you are
No matter how far you run, you have not gone too far"

Take a deep breath, and swallow your pride
Turn from the path you're on, and conquer the fear inside
Dead men tell no tales;
But if you're still alive you can still write your story
Dead men tell no tales;
But there is still time for the hard climb to glory
You might also like
I see you writhing in pain from all the hell that you've seen
You left it all for a life that never satisfied you
Unloved by the world you lost it all to conform to
There's still hope in the voice that's crying out inside you
If you can hear it, you still have time

Come back to your home, and all you're running from
I'm begging you to come back to your home, and all you're running from
I'm begging you to come back

"You are not what you've done, and this is not who you are
No matter how far you run, you have not gone too far
You are not what you've done, and this is not who you are
No matter how far you run, you have not gone too far"

Come back home
This is a song for the fallen
I see you rising again!
Come back home
Your story isn't over;
But one day it will come to an end
Time is running out!
Dead men tell no tales
Make no mistake: time is running out!
Dead men tell no tales
