There is no turning back
I'd walked away from everything that could save me
I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back
I once was blind, but now I see things clearly
I'll never see the world the same way
The words of truth within this Man forever changed me
Is He just flesh and blood, or is there more to the power I see?
Filled with the strength of God, but He moves and breathes as a man, just like me
When the Spirit overcomes the flesh
You'll see One man with power over death
So let me die
And let the saints rise
With hands like mine, He turned water to wine
Let me die
And let the saints rise
With hands like mine, He gave sight to the blind
And He opened up my eyes
I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back
I'd walked away from everything that could save me
I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back
I once was blind, but now I see things clearly
I'll never see the world the same way
The words of truth within this Man forever changed me
You might also likeBreak the chains that bind me
Flesh and blood, filled with the fire of God
Come break the chains of my bondage
Flesh and blood, filled with the fire of God
Deliver us from the darkness
How could a man like me be a man that's so unlike me?
The words you say got me turned away from the man I might be
My hands can build, but your hands can create
My hands can help, but your hands can save
I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back
I'd walked away from everything that could save me
I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back
I once was blind, but now I see things clearly
I'll never see the world the same way
The words of truth within this Man forever changed me
The blind will see flesh and blood, filled with the fire of God
Come break the chains of my bondage
Flesh and blood, filled with the fire of God
