I see the glorious everlasting
Open heaven
Before my eyes, there is glory passing
It's what the rocks shout, and the stars speak:
Only one God reigns
This is the day when heaven and earth meet
Only one God reigns
All creation knows His name
And now I stand before Him
All creation knows His name
And every heart adores Him
With eyes that burn like fire
I found hope for hopeless men
I see heaven open wide
So let hope arise again
With eyes that burn like fire
I found hope for hopeless men
I see heaven open wide
So let hope arise again
Even death has to bow down
At the throne of the King
All hell has to bow down
Every nation will sing:
There is only One who is worthy
Every nation will sing:
There is only One who is worthy
I would give everything
You might also likeNo matter what the cost
I will follow Him
No matter what the cost
I will follow Him
To seek and save the lost
I will follow Him
God has come to His people
God has come to this land
So let hope arise again
With eyes that burn like fire
I found Hope for hopeless men
I see heaven open wide
So let hope arise again
With eyes that burn like fire
I found Hope for hopeless men
I see heaven open wide
So let hope arise again
It's what the rocks shout, and the stars speak:
Only one God reigns
This is the day when heaven and earth meet
Only one God reigns
All creation knows His name
And now I stand before Him
All creation knows His name
And every heart adores Him
I walk the narrow road
And follow the One that can set me free
I never have to walk alone
This is my destiny
