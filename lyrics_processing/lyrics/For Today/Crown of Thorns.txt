We crown Him with a crown of thorns
This is the end of a life that's been poured out for all mankind
In suffering, manifest glory has come at the fullness of time
King of Kings
Beaten and broken down why would he live like a servant
King of Kings
Descending lower now
Why should he die like a slave
The proud will be humbled, the meek will inherit the earth
The last will be first to inherit the earth
I know down is the way up so master show me how to serve
The last will be first to inherit the earth
The last will be first to inherit the earth
It should have been me
With the nails through my hands and feet
Facing the wrath of God
It should have been me
Left to pay for my sin forsaken
But in the blood I stand here
It should have been me
Born to die
He bore the fire of God's holy wrath on his shoulders
Born to die
I watched Him pour out his life as a ransom for all
You might also likeAnd as he carried His cross on his back
Beaten and bloody, yeah I saw myself there too
Because I've been broken by a world that hates me
But I'm not alone anymore (Alone no more)
No one can take His life; He laid it down for me
That twisted wreath of thorns, yeah He took that crown for me
Then after three days, out of the ground for me
He overcame it all!
Now I live to serve Him
With stripes on his back
Betrayed by the ones that he loves so perfectly
We spit in his face and we crowned Him
We crown Him with a crown of thorns
We crown Him with a crown of thorns
We crown Him with a crown of thorns
We crown Him with a crown of thorns
