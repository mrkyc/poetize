I gave it all for the sake of the ones that I loved more than anything
Day after day, night after night, I saw them shining bright
I gave it all for a scene and a dream that I still believe in
I saw them rising up, and then they said it was not enough

Everything I'd come to love had turned against me
In a moment, I'd been made into the enemy
The enemy of those that claimed that they were with me
I'd been cast out of the place I once belonged

Hated by the world, betrayed and abandoned
Hated by the world; all alone, I was standing there
Hated by the world, rejected
Hated by the world, I lost it all
Hated by the world

I gave it all for the sake of the ones that I loved more than anything
Day after day, night after night, I saw them shining bright
I gave it all for a scene and a dream that I still believe in
I saw them rising up, and then they said it was not enough

Slander turned their hearts against me
Oh, how quickly lies become the truth
Broken and betrayed, bleeding heart on display
With no one left to listen, and nothing left to say
Broken and betrayed, bleeding heart on display
With no one left to listen, and nothing left to say

Everything I'd come to love had turned against me
In a moment, I'd been made into the enemy
The enemy of those that claimed that they were with me
I'd been cast out of the place I once belonged

What I'd thought was unbreakable (Is lying broken at my feet)
I haven't given up on you, even if you gave up on me!
What I'd thought was unbreakable is lying broken at my feet
I haven't given up on you, even if you gave up on me
What I'd thought was unbreakable is lying broken at my feet
I haven't given up on you, even if you gave up on me
I will always stand for you, even if I stand alone
