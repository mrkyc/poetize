Friends tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
That's not the way I see it
'Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me

People always talk about reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me
Friends are always telling me you're a user
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me

Friends seem to always listen
To the bad things that you do
You never do them to me
You may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine
You might also like
People always talk about reputation
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me
Friends are always telling me
You're a user
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me
Just be good to me

Love is a game of chances
So I'll take my chance with you
And you I won't try to change
We talk about it and I'd
Rather have a piece of you
Than all of nothing

(Just be good to me) In the morning
(Just be good to me) In the afternoon or evening
(Just be good to me) Yeah, just be good to me
(Just be good to me)
(Just be good to me) I'm not the jealous kind
I won't tie you down when you need me
I'll be around (Just be good to me)
I'll be good to you, you'll be good to me
We could be together, be together
(Just be good to me)
(Just be good to me)
