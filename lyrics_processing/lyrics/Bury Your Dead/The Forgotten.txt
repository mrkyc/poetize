Now that you started this fire inside of me
I'll be burning forever
I was in the dark, but you held me
I was so lost out there, just floating along
It's getting harder and harder to see over the walls I've built around myself
They just keep getting higher and higher
Look at what you've created
This structure that never lets you in
Some days the hardest choice you make is which bridge to cross to see better days
Well, I'm the bridge you burned
Turn and walk away from screaming
You failed me
She was looking for an answer
I was searching for a way to make these bitter pills easier to swallow
When I could not face the day
Some days the hardest choice you make is which bridge to cross to see better days
Well, I'm the bridge you burned
Turn and walk away from screaming
You failed me
When your words lose taste in my mouth
When the ink runs dry and the time runs out
I'll be the bridge you burn
Turn and walk away from screaming
You failed me

I'd hear crying
Praying for a savior to take her away
I'd hear crying
Some days the hardest choice you make is which bridge to cross to see better days
Well, I'm the bridge you burned
Turn and walk away from screaming
You failed me
When your words lose taste in my mouth
When the ink runs dry and the time runs out
I'll be the bridge you burn
Turn and walk away from screaming
You failed me
Some days the hardest choice you make is which bridge to cross to see better days
Well, I'm the bridge you burned
Turn and walk away from screaming
You failed me
When your words lose taste in my mouth
When the ink runs dry and the time runs out
I'll be the bridge you burn
Turn and walk away from screaming
