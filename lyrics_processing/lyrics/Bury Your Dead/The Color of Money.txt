Did you see that we were strong?
I see you're weak
Did you see we're strong?
We all make mistakes in life
You make your choice, same time you made mine
You found a man that you'd give for
And what you gave would mean my everything
You'd come around in the long run
I can see now how we all lost hope
'Cause we, we would spend everyday
Thinking about you, we'd grow strong without you
We had each other, that's all we needed
Life wasn't easy but it could be beat
A constant battle, mine for the taking
With them beside me and that's all I'd need
We had each other, that's all we needed
Life wasn't easy but it could be beat
A constant battle, mine for the taking
With them beside me and that's all I'd need
The years without you were far from easy
We'd have our visits but only in my dreams
I might sleep smiling though I was cold
We had a fire, that's not what makes a home
Forget the past, let's forget the struggle
We have you back and that's all I need to know
You need us now and we all forgive you
I see you're weak, did you see we're strong?
You might also likeForget the past, forget the past
Are you proud that we all turned out so strong?
We have you back, we have you now
Are you proud that we all turned out so strong?
You need us now and we all forgive you
Are you proud that we turned out so strong?
I see you're weak, did you see we're strong?
Are you proud that we turned out so strong?
Are you proud that we turned out so strong?
Are you proud? Are you proud?
We all make mistakes in life
You make your choice, at the same time you made mine
You found a man that you'd give for
