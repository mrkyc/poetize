I wonder if I'll ever see you
Hey, Lori
I'm hopin' 'cause, baby, I need you
You got me one day happy
The next day sad
You are the sweetest thing I've never had
But what I need right now
You gotta give me some kind of sign
Hey, Lori
I wonder if we could be kissin'
Don't worry
'Cause you'll never know what you're missin'
You've done somethin' that I can't undo
Oh, all the things I wanna do for you
You got me cryin' out loud
Oh, cryin' out loud
For cryin' out loud
Lori, won't you pick up the phone?
Hey, Lori
If you knew how my heart was wishin'
Hey, Lori

I wonder, baby, will the heartache end?
Should I give up or do you think I'll win?
