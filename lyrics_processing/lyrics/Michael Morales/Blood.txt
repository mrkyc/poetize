'Til my blood runs cold
The road out of here
I wonder where'd it go
And I stumble for the light switch
And I try to feel the wall
And I try to make some sense of it
But I ain't no fool
And it don't make no sense at all
It ain't no difference
If you're black or white
You little house is burnin'
Baby, that's all right
There's a new king callin'
And he wants blood
And in the ninth hour
I wonder what I'd done
The way that I've been shut out
It cuts me to the bone
Yeah, and I try to understand it
Read the writin' on the wall
Yeah, I need a little hand up
'Cause I'm taking a fall

It don't make a difference, baby
Where you're at
Every day the knife
Gets closer to your back
(To your back)
When the night is fallin'
(Fallin')
And he wants blood
Yeah, take the fire
Revile your snake
And cauterize your first mistake
Look around
'Cause I got somethin' to say
It ain't no difference

Don't make a difference who you are
Do you wanna be someone someday?
I don't care what they say
Gonna try to drag you on down
It ain't no difference
If you're black or white
