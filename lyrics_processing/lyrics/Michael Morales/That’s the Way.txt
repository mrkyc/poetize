It doesn't really matter 'cause it's me and you
Mixing it up in a battle of love
Keepin' it together though we push and shove
You see the world through dangerous eyes
When you gonna reckon with your pack of lies?
Some take it hard, some take it slow
It take it like I want it and that's the way it goes
That's the way, that's the way
That's the way the music plays
I've seen 'em die on the mountain
That's the way it goes
Sometimes you will, sometimes you won't
You say you really love me, but you know you don't
Same old dance, same old song (Same old song)
Keep the motor runnin' while we move along, yeah
We're movin' on
Hey
Devil to the left, suits to the right
You wanna take me out, you're gonna have to fight
Some gotta stay, some gotta go
I'm keepin' it together and that's the way it goes

That's the way, that's the way
That's the way the music plays
I've seen 'em die up in the sky
That's the way it goes
 to outer space
We'll take the world away
The Lord my soul to take
You can't erase the dream
No, you can't bury me
And I gotta know
Is anybody
