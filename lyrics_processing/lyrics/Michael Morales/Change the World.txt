It's been a long time, you know
If you think you can run away
Don't even think about it
Don't let it end
Might not have this again
If I've hurt you then I can't stay
No need to talk about it
So cry me a river
Make it ten miles wide
Then you'll know what I feel inside
Where's it gonna end?
I don't wanna change the world
I just wanna turn your heart around
I don't want the oceans dry
I just want the chance to show you how
I just want you here by me
Then I don't wanna change the world
Say you gotta move on
I wish you love where you're goin'
If you think that I won't let you go
Don't even think about it
Baby, take care
'Cause it can be cold out there
If you need me, I'll be around
You can be sure about it
You might also like'Cause I'd walk through fire
And any storm I could stand
But you gotta reach out your hand
Can't you see it?
I don't wanna change the world
I just wanna turn your heart around
I don't want the oceans dry
I just want the chance to show you how
I just want you here by me
Then I don't have to change the world
Ooh, yeah
Come on
It know that it's been crazy
I know it's hard to tell
But listen up, yeah
Don't you lose yourself
I don't wanna change the world
I just wanna turn your heart around
I don't wanna own the sky
I just want your lips to tell me now
That you wanna be with me
Then I don't have to change the world
I don't wanna change the world
I just wanna turn your heart around
I don't wanna own the sky
I just want the words to show you how
I don't wanna change the world
I just wanna turn your heart around
I don't wanna own the sky
