Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Who do you give your love to?
Are we not lovers? Are we not friends?
There was no reason to let it end
Until you sat me down
You say you don't love me anymore
I always thought that we could work it out
Too deep in love and I had no doubt
It was all over town that you went around
I think it's happenin' again
Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Where do you cool your desire?
Who do you give your heart to?
Who is it that you see?
Who do you give your love to?
And why can't it be me?
I really think I should let it go
Why am I always the last to know?
And I don't really care
Except that it's been so long
You might also likeI like to think it was you and me
We fit together so easily
But now I can't get through to the lover in you
You got me guessing again, I'm wondering:
Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Where do you cool your desire?
Who do you give your heart to?
Who is it that you see? Yeah
Who do you give your love to?
And why can't it be me?
Why can't it be me?
Why can't it be me?
Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Where do you cool your desire?
Who do you give your heart to?
Who is it that you see?
It hasn't been like it used to
Who do you give your love to?
Who do you give your love to?
(Who do you give your love to?)
Where do you drown the fire?
(Drown the fire)
It hasn't been like it used to
(Ooh)
Who do you give your love to?
(Who do you give your love?)
Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Who do you give your love to?
(Who do you give your love?)
Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
(Gotta drown the fire)
It hasn't been like it used to
