Hello, how have you been?
I feel like I'm losing again
I telephone all of my friends
I can't believe that you want it to end
When I look into your eyes
(There's no one there)
Every time we try to talk
(Well, you're just not there)
Well, it came as a surprise
('Cause I thought you cared)
Baby, don't you realize
Hey, 
Why, why, why
Won't you try, try, try?
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
And I could die, die, die
You better stop this game
Before you push all my love away
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry over you
Hello, how do you do?
This emptiness reminds me of you
There wasn't one thing I wouldn't do
I thought that one plus one equaled two

(You were by my side)
And you said you'd always be
('Cause it felt just fine)
Now you're pushin' me away
(When you held me tight)
Baby, I want you to stay
Hey, 
Why, why, why
Won't you try, try, try?
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
And I could die, just die
You better stop this game
Before you push all my love away
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry over you
When I look into your eyes
(There's no one there)
Every time we try to talk
(Well, you're just not there)
Well, it came as a surprise
('Cause I thought you cared)
Baby, don't you realize
Hey, you're gonna kill me?
Why, why, why
Won't you try, try, try?
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
And I could die, just die
You better stop this game
Before you push all my love away
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry over you
Cry, cry, cry over you
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry over you
Cry, cry, cry
