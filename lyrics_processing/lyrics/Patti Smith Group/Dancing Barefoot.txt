She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with he

Here I go and I don't know why
I fell so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me?

I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He, who is chosen by she

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me?
You might also like
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine


She is re-creation
She, intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
'Til I lose my sense of gravity

I'm dancing barefoot
Hit me, there I spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

Oh, God, I fell for you
Oh, God, I fell for you
The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face
Oh, God, I fell for you
The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself
Grave visitations
Oh, God, I fell for you
What is it that calls to us?
Why must we pray screaming?
Why must not death be redefined?
Oh, God, I fell for you
We shut our eyes, we stretch out our arms
Oh, God, I fell for you
And whirl on a pane of glass
Oh, God, I fell for you
An afixiation a fix on anything
The line of life the limb of a tree
Oh, God, I fell for you
The hands of he and the promise
Oh, God, I fell for you
That she is blessed among women
Oh, God, I fell for you
