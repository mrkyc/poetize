I like dressing fly I can't even lie
I can take your chick I can't even lie
I like getting money I can't even lie
I put that on my mama I can't even lie
I can't even lie
I can't even lie
I can't even lie
I can't even lie
I'm one of a kind I can't even lie
I put that on my mama I can't even lie
VERSE 1:
I can't even lie
It's a god damn shame
I been doing this too long
YALL don't know my name
Mr. Order what you want
Poppin bottles like money ain't a thang
Walk in the club and all I see is a whole bunch of lames
You might also likeA whole bunch of flexing
A whole bunch of games
A whole bunch of people thinking they buzzin claiming they fame
Claiming they this claiming they that but they all just the same
Claiming they hot but we know that you're  not so just stay in ya lane
