Who dat?
Who dat, who dat?

I'm gonna wear you to the ball tonight
Put on your best dress tonight

Did you hear what the man said, baby?
Said be your best 'cause this gonna be your musical test
So come to school and I take up the musical rule
Give me soul brothers, deal with soul sisters
Come to I and maybe you can make it if you try
So be wise and be changing, put on your best
Because I've got your musical key
Rub it baby, I said scrub it, yeah!
'Cause I'm tougher than tough and that ain't no bluff
Maybe it's because I've got the musical stuff

I'm gonna make you the talk of the town
No use wearing a frown
Though those other guys may put you down
I'm gonna let you wear my crown
Though those other guys may put you down
You wear my crown
