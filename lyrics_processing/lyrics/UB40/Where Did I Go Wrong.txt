I'm sitting here, praying
That you weren't just saying
Leaving tomorrow was what you had planned

No point in pretending
I know that it's ending
I just wanna know where the ending began

Where did I go wrong to make it like this?
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss
Holding you now hurts more than it should
If I let you go, girl
You'll be gone for good

I thought you had saved me
The love that you gave me
The sweetest loving, in all of the land
But you've taken my heart
And you've torn it apart
And it crumbled to dust, in the palm of your hand

Where did I go wrong to make it like this?
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss
Holding you now hurts more than it should
If I let you go, girl
You'll be gone for good

There's nothin' worth sayin'
I know you're not staying
Might as well face it, it's out of my hand

No point in pretending
I know that it's ending
I just wanna know where the ending began

Where did I go wrong to make it like this?
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss
Holding you now hurts more than it should
If I let you go, girl
You'll be gone for good
Where did I go wrong to make it like this?
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss
Holding you now hurts more than it should
If I let you go, girl
You'll be gone for good
