Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I...still need her so
Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go, memories won't go
I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget:
Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart...my blue heart
I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget:
Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart...my blue, blue heart
Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
You keep me rockin' all of the time
Red, red wine, you make me feel so grand
I feel a million dollar when you're just in my hand
Red, red wine, you make me feel so sad
Any time I see you go, it make me feel bad
Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline
(Red, red wine)
Red, red wine, you give me whole heap of zing
Whole heap of zing; you make me do my own thing
(It's up to you...)
Red, red wine, you give enough of love
You're a kind of lovin' like a blessing from above
Red, red wine, I loved you right from the start
Right from the start, with all of my heart
Red, red wine in an eighties style
Red, red wine in a modern beat style
Yeah
(I'd have sworn...)
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
(That with time)
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
(Thoughts of you would leave my head)
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
You make me feel fine all of the time
Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey pack him Rizla pon the sweet Dep line
The line broke, the monkey get choked
Bunbah, ganjapani, little rubber boat
(Red, red wine)
Red, red wine, I'm gonna hold on to you
Hold on to you 'cause I know you love truth
(Stay close to me)
Red, red wine, I'm gonna love you 'til I die
Love you 'til I die, and that's no lie
(Don't let me be alone)
Red, red wine, can't get you off my mind
Wherever you may be, I'll surely find
See UB40 LiveGet tickets as low as $16You might also like(It's tearing apart...)
I'll surely find
Make no fuss
(My blue heart) -
Just stick with us
(I'd have sworn...)
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
(That with time)
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind

Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
You make me feel fine all of the time
Red, red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline
The line broke, the monkey get choked
