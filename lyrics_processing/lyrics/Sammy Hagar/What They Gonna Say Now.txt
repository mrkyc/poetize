People keep tellin' me
"Better save your money, baby
Save it for a rainy day."
And I say, let it rain 'cause
It sure ain't money, babe
Cause me to say what I say
I been criticized
For the way I look
The way I play, the way I sing
Say what'cha want
From way down there
'Cause up here it's got a bullshit ring
I'm not concerned (not concerned)
What I read (what I read)
What I hear
What the future holds
I take my chances (I take my chances)
Blow by blow (Blow by blow)
Because the truth has yet to be told

What they gonna say now
Watching these politicians
Swimmin' in a sea of sharks
One of 'em's got blood on his hands
Everyone scrambles
Just to save his own ass
And the opposition moves in and makes demands
A full investigation
Maybe a resignation
No, no matter what the cost
It's not for the country, no
Two terms in a row
The democrats have lost
Well, I'm not concerened (not concerned)
