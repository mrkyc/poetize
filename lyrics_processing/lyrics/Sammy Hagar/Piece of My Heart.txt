Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only one?
And didn't I give you everything I could?
Well, didn't I get it to you now, baby?
After all the love I gave you
There was never enough
Well, I'm gonna show you, baby
That this man can get tough

Just come on, come on, come on, come on
And (Take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Oh, break a)
Break another little piece of my heart and throw it away
(Oh, take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it
If it makes you feel good, oh yeah

Out there in the streets lookin' good
And in your heart you know it ain't right, it just ain't right
Yeah, and you never, never, never, never hear me
When I cry all night
I keep tryin' to tell myself that I
Can't stand the pain
But then you hold me in your arms, ooh, baby
And I gotta say it again
