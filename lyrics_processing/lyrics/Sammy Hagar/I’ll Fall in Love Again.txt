You do what you wanna do
I'll leave it all up to you
In time, I'll find love again
A hot love growin' cold
Just when you thought you'd found a heart of gold
Looks like I've been fooled again

But it's alright with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck, I'm bound to win
'Cause I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love again

And you're always sittin' ring side
Just a-rollin' with the changing tide
The tide has washed you from my mind
And I guess you think you've got it made
Oh, but then you never were afraid
Of anything that you left behind

Oh, but it's alright with me now
'Cause I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck, yes, I'm bound to win
'Cause I'll fall in love
Yes, I'll fall in love again

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

I'll fall in love again, uh-huh
I'll fall in love again, baby
I say now, I'll fall in love again
Yes, I'll fall in love again

Here's something to compare it to
Like the little things you used to do
Like giving more than you take
Funny how the reasons grow
Then the very next thing you know
The odds change, dividing up the cake

Hey, but it's alright with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck, yes, I'm bound to win
'Cause I'll fall in love
Yes, it's alright with me now
(I'll fall in love again)
Don't worry 'bout me, baby, I'll get along somehow
(I'll fall in love again)
Yes, it's alright, yes, it's alright
(I'll fall in love again)
And you do what you wanna do
(I'll fall in love)
Oh, yes, it's alright with me now
(I'll fall in love again)
I'll get along somehow, I'm gonna look at tonight
(I'll fall in love again)
Just gonna walk around, just walk around
