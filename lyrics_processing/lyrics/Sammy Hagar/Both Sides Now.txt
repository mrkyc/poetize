Connected like the ring around your finger
And I know this like I know myself
Not very well, yet I'm no stranger
But it won't be long
I see both sides now
When nothing's gained, then something's lost
Pay half the price at twice the cost
We're crystallized, we stand alone
Conviction holds us like a stone, oh yeah
But I know it won't be long
'Cause I see both sides now
Yeah, we got to learn how to listen before we learn to talk
We got to learn how to crawl before we learn to walk
And if you want a little peace, sometimes you got to fight
We got to walk through the darkness, oh
Before we stand in the light, oh yeah
But I know it won't be long
I see both sides now
We're always somewhere in between
We never taste the sweet extreme
And we're crystallized, we stand alone
Conviction holds us like a stone
