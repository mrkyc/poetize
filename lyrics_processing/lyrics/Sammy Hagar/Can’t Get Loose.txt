What makes him stand and fight
When he only wants to love?
And why do they push so hard
When he only needs a shove?
Every time I see him give
It's his turn to take
Every time I see him go
Everybody says to wait, ooh

Can't get loose, you can fight like hell
But you can't get loose, you can dream
But you can't get loose, it's holdin' on, holdin' on
Can't get loose, oh, no, no

What makes one man rich?
How's another man get so poor?
What makes someone care so much
For things another man can just ignore?
Some questions go unanswered
And they have for quite some time
Some things forever sacred
We're just prisoners of our own mind, oh

Can't get loose, we can fight like hell
But we can't get loose, we can dream
But we can't get loose, keeps on holdin' on, holdin' on
Can't get loose, shake it, shake it
Can't get loose

Oh yeah, there she sits with stars in her eyes
But too afraid to dance
'Cause every guy that she holds so close
Just wants to get in her pants, oh yeah
Can't get loose
Can't get loose
Can't get loose
Can't get loose

Tell me what keeps her by his side
When she's treated just like dirt
The fear of the dark unknown
Appears to be much worse than the hurt
So she stays up nights and dreams
Of a knight in shining armor
Who will rescue her one day
While time keeps going against her? Ooh
Can't get loose, yeah, you can fight like hell
But you can't get loose, you can dream
Oh, but you can't get loose, keeps on holdin' on, holdin' on
Can't get loose, shake, shake
Can't get loose, yeah, just fight like hell
But you can't get loose, keeps on holdin' on, holdin' on
And you can't get loose, oh, no, no
I know you can't get loose, you can shake it, shake it
Can't get loose, I know you fight like hell
But you can't get loose, yeah, you can dream
Ooh, but you can't get loose, go on and fight like hell
But you can't get loose, shake, shake, shake it, shake it, shake it
But you can't get loose, ooh
Can't get loose
Can't get loose, ooh
Can't get loose
