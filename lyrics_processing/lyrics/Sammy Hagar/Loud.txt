Sixteen, I found my dream machine
Turn the key and every light turned green
Like Steve McQueen, I made a motor scream
And it was loud, yeah
Me and the boys would drive around
We searched the dial until we found
One song we didn't want to turn down
And it was loud
Hear us comin' from a mile away
Like rolling thunder on Judgement Day, yeah
Hear us comin' from a mile away
Faster than the law allowed
And we were loud
Loud like a hurricane
Loud like a roaring train
It sure was loud, uh huh
Yeah, and I remember ol' what's-his-name, whoo
Young and bold, I took my aim
She lost control when she came
It was loud, yeah

Hear her comin' from a mile away

Well, she was loud
Loud like a dirty dream, mmm
Loud like a siren's scream, whoo
She was loud
She was loud
Like a trashcan cherry bomb, yeah
Like a storm before the calm, whoo
She was loud
Well, I live my life at full volume
I live my life cranked to ten
The needle's in the red again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
In the red again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here tonight, it's crystal clear
Red hot lights and a hometown cheer
All my life, I've dreamed of standin' right here
Yeah, it was loud
Whoo, like a Super Bowl (loud)
Led Zeppelin playin' "Rock And Roll"
Yeah, it was loud
Loud
Like a trashcan cherry bomb
Like a storm before the calm
It was loud, yeah, yeah
It was loud
Loud like a hurricane
Loud like a roaring train
Yeah, it was loud
Yeah, trashcan cherry bomb, whoo
