Driving in from Malibu
Reservation made for two
"Stuck in traffic, be there soon"
Throw some money in the meter
Fifteen minutes late to meet her
Runnin' past the movie theater
Nervous in the elevator
Will I like her? Will I hate her?
Will she leave me for the waiter?

But there you are, there you are
Waiting for me at the bar
All my worries disappear 'cause we're here

Oh, take it easy, let it flow
Don't know where it's gonna go
But it feels good not to know
Oh, crackin' smiles and makin' jokes
Don't know where it's gonna go
But it feels good not to know

We sit down and order drinks
Talk about your favorite things
Play guitar, but you can't sing
Favorite movie's Dumb and Dumber
Drank champagne for a whole summer
When you broke up with that drummer
There's no pressure, no forever
I'm just glad to be together
Love to get to know you better
You might also like
'Cause we're here, yeah, we're here
Been DM-in' for a year
All my worries disappear 'cause we're here

Oh, take it easy, let it flow
Don't know where it's gonna go
But it feels good not to know
Oh, crackin' smiles and makin' jokes
Don't know where it's gonna go
But it feels good not to know

Conversations about art
The spaghetti tattoo on your arm
Yeah, we talked until the restaurant lights came on
We say our goodbyes and you
Say, "Let's do this again soon"
Yeah, I really hope we do

Oh, take it easy, let it flow
Don't know where it's gonna go
But it feels good not to know
Oh, crackin' smiles and makin' jokes
Don't know where it's gonna go
But it feels good not to know
Don't know where it's gonna go
