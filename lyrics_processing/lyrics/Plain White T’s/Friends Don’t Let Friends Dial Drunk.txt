Those are all very beautiful words
But actions speak louder in case you haven't heard
I'm all alone
While you're out on the town drinkin' with your friends
You can say all these beautiful things
But they don't mean nothing
No, they don't mean a thing
Gotta back it up
But you keep backing down
Tell me how this ends

If you think it's possible than anything is possible
But I think you're impossible
I hope you prove me wrong

You only call me after you've had a few
You only want to hang out when you've got nothing to do
Don't tell me you love me and act like you don't
Oh, if you really want me you just gotta let me know

Same old thing happens every night
You get me going, and then you say goodbye
I'm heated up
And you just leave me there to take care of myself
Don't get mad, don't get all wound up
Just get your act together, or baby give it up
Just let me know if I should hit the road or if you want my help
You might also like
If you think it's possible than anything is possible
But I think you're impossible
I hope you prove me wrong

You only call me after you've had a few
You only want to hang out when you've got nothing to do
Don't tell me you love me and act like you don't
Oh, if you really want me you just gotta let me know
You only call me when there's no one around
You only wanna come up when you know I'm going down
Don't tell me you love me and act like you don't
Oh, if you really want me you just gotta let me know

You gotta show me you mean it, if you really mean it
You're talking to me like you mean it, and I don't believe it

You only call me after you've had a few
You only want to hang out when you've got nothing to do
Don't tell me you love me and act like you don't
Oh, if you really want me you just gotta let me know
You only call me when there's no one around
You only wanna come up when you know I'm going down
Don't tell me you love me and act like you don't
Oh, if you really want me you just gotta let me know
You only call me after you've had a few (oh oh oh)
You only want to hang out when you've got nothing to do (oh oh oh)
Don't tell me you love me and act like you don't
