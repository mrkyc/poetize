This is my last call to you
Then I'll give up everything
That we had, that we'd do
And you'll never hear me sing
All these songs about you
So just take this time and think
Just take this time and think

Think about the things that we had
The good times before they went bad
They're not gone just yet
It's all up to you
Think about the dreams in our heads
Layin' awake, holding on in my bed
Why don't you go ahead
And make them come true

I still believe in you

This is my last call to you
Then I'll give up everything
That we had, that we'd do
And you'll never hear me sing
All these songs about you
So just take this time and think
Just take this time and think
You might also like
Think about the plans that we made
Drivin' around while the radio played
They may have gotten delayed
They're waiting for you
Think about the look in my eyes
Saying I love you the very first time
Focused, not blind
And you said it too

I still believe in you

This is my last call to you
Then I'll give up everything
That we had, that we'd do
And you'll never hear me sing
All these songs about you
So just take this time and think
Just take this time and think

Think of everything
Think of everything we had
Think of everything
Think of everything we haven't had
Like livin' in the Midwest Club
Goin' on our honeymoon in Paris
Makin' out when we're grown up
Listening to the best man speech
From Darren
Think of everything we had
Knowing how it feels to be in love
And kisses that would drive us mad
Going to the Metro
Giving up what we will
Never have again
Will it ever be the two of us again?

This is my last call to you
Then I'll give up everything
That we had, that we'd do
And you'll never hear me sing
All these songs about you
So just take this time and think
Plans we made but didn't see through
Just take this time and think
Memories, me and you
Just take this time and think
Dreams we had that never came true
Just take this time and think
The look in my eyes, looking at you
Just take this time and think
Just take this time and think
