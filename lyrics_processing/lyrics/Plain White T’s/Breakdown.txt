I've seen a man cry
I've seen a man shoutout
Afraid of losing the woman he loves
I've seen a woman lying
To her man flat out
About who she's been with
And where she was
I've seen them both fight
And try to figure it out
This fight isn't going anywhere
I've seen a child's eyes
Watching his parents freak out
I know they see him but they just don't care

It won't stop if they don't stop yelling
It's not the way of working your problems out
I can't stand being around this yelling
So I'm finding my way out

I'm gonna drive and never ever slow down
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Packing my things and getting out of this town
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
You might also like
I've seen a child's eyes
I've seen him living in doubt
Not ever knowing what it's like to be in love
I've seen his friends try
And just help him get out
He never told them what the problem really was
I've seen a suicide
They couldn't figure it out
He blamed himself because they couldn't get along
I've seen his parents eyes
Trying to figure it out
Where did our baby go and what went wrong?

It won't stop if they don't stop yelling
It's not the way of working your problems out
I can't stand being around this yelling
So I'm finding my way out

I'm gonna drive and never ever slow down
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Packing my things and getting out of this town
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Hold it inside until I breakdown
Not gonna try until I break down
Say my goodbyes until I breakdown
(baby come on)
I'm gonna drive and never ever slow down
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Packing my things and getting out of this town
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
I'm gonna drive and never ever slow down
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Packing my things and getting out of this town
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
