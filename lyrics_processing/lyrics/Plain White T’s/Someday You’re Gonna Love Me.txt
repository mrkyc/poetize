In my mind you're all mine
I've loved you since the day we met
But I'll keep this love secret
You're just too young to understand
But don't worry, there's no hurry
You've got some catching up to do
So go be young, go have fun
I'm fine just waiting here for you

It doesn't matter if you love me
I'm gonna love you anyway
It doesn't matter how you feel right now
'Cause there's no doubt someday you're gonna love me

I'll pretend to be friends
Until your heart is all mine
When you see things clearly
You'll know I've loved you all this time
And I'll promise every kiss
Will be the sweetest of your life
These two arms will keep you warm
Make sure you're safe and satisfied
You might also like
It doesn't matter if you love me
I'm gonna love you anyway
It doesn't matter how you feel right now
'Cause there's no doubt someday you're gonna love me
It doesn't matter if you love me
I'm gonna love you anyway
It doesn't matter how you feel right now
'Cause there's no doubt someday you're gonna love me

Take your time
Take your time
I'll show you what love means
You've never felt so free
I'll show you what love means
You've never felt so free
I'll show you what love means
You've never felt so free
You've never felt so free

It doesn't matter if you love me
I'm gonna love you anyway
It doesn't matter how you feel right now
'Cause there's no doubt someday you're gonna love me
Matter if you love me
I'm gonna love you anyway
It doesn't matter how you feel right now
'Cause there's no doubt someday you're gonna love me
Someday you're gonna love me
Someday you're gonna love me
Someday you're gonna love me
