They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would wise for you to be in the room next time
Join the land of the living
And what if you fall
Ain't it the falling that's the best part
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck

Do what you want, not what you need
We cast a vote here, and everyone agrees
So here's a thought, let's plant a seed
You're in a rut, take this literature to read

Can you tell me is there anybody in my home
All that I do is listen
Can you tell me is there anybody in my home
To join the land of the living

They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would wise for you to be in the room next time
Join the land of the living
And what if you fall
Ain't it the falling that's the best part
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck
You might also like
Will you admit you never tried
You let the fear in and then it multiplied
You are a ghost who saw a fire
You're in a rut, think today you'll stay inside

Can you tell me is there anybody on the phone
All that I do is listen
Can you tell me is there anybody on the phone
To join the land of the living

They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would wise for you to be in the room next time
Join the land of the living
And what if you fall
Ain't it the falling that's the best part
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck
Don't join the land of the living
They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would wise for you to be in the room next time
Join the land of the living
And what if you fall
Ain't it the falling that's the best part
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck
Don't join the land of the living
They won't leave you behind
