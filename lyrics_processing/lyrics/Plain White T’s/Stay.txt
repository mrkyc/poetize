My heavy heart in my empty hands
My heavy head just don't understand
I walk around keep on wondering
Do you want, do you want me?
I thought maybe you would stick around
I should've known you would let me down
A heartbreaker when the lights go out
Do you want, do you want me?

Love means, love me the way I love you
Love means, love me can't help but love you
Love means, love me, you know you wanna
Love means, love means
So why don't you just stay, stay?
Why don't you just stay, stay?

I don't know why I just can't move on
Is like my mind won't believe you're gone
And now your words linger on and on
Do you want, do you want me?
Now you've become another sad song
Just another girl that did me wrong
Maybe you'll hear it and you'll come back home
Do you want, do you want me?
You might also like
Love means, love me the way I love you
Love means, love me can't help but love you
Love means, love me, you know you wanna
Love means, love means
So why don't you just stay, stay?
Why don't you just stay, stay?

Nobody ever hurt me
Walked away and desert me like you?
Why don't you stay and love me?
I will always be in love with you!

Love means, love me the way I love you
Love means, love me can't help but love you
Love means, love me, you know you wanna
Love means, love means
So why don't you just stay, stay?
Why don't you just stay, stay?

Why don't you just stay, stay?
Why don't you just stay, stay?
Stay (Love means, love me the way I love you)
Stay (Love means, love me can't help but love you)
Stay (Love means, love me, you know you wanna)
