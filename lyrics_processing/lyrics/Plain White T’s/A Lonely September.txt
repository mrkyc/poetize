I'm sitting here all by myself
Just trying to think of something to do
I'm trying to think of something, anything
Just to keep me from thinking of you
But you know, it's not working out
'Cause you're all that's on my mind
One thought of you is all it takes
To leave the rest of the world behind

Well I didn't mean for this to go
As far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close
And share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back
But I know you did

I'm sitting here trying to convince myself
That you're not the one for me
But the more I think, the less I believe it
And the more I want you here with me
You know the holidays are coming up
I don't want to spend them alone
Memories of Christmas time with you
Will just kill me if I'm on my own
You might also like
Well I didn't mean for this to go
As far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close
And share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back

I know it's not the smartest thing to do
We just can't seem to get it right
But what I wouldn't give to have one more chance tonight
One more chance tonight

I'm sitting here trying to entertain
Myself with this old guitar
But with all my inspiration gone
It's not getting me very far
I look around my room and everything
I see reminds me of you
Oh please, baby won't you take my hand
We've got nothing left to prove

Well I didn't mean for this to go
As far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close
And share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back
But I know you did
And I didn't mean to meet you then
Then when we were just kids
And I didn't mean to give you chills
The way that I kiss
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back but I know you did
Don't say you didn't love me back 'cause you know you did
No, you didn't mean to love me back
