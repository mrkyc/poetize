Your time has already come
And I don't know why
The last thing that I had heard
You were doing just fine
It seems like just yesterday
I was laughing with you
Playing games at Grandma's house
Well you taught me well, didn't you?
I hope I'm just like you

And do they have radios in heaven?
I hope they do
'Cause they're playing my song on the radio
And I'm singing it to you, you, you, you

You left before I had a chance
To say goodbye
But that's the way life usually is
It just passes you by
But you can't hold on to regrets
And you can't look back
So I'll just be thankful for the
Times that I had with you
I hope I'm just like you
You might also like
Well, do they have radios in heaven?
I hope they do
'Cause they're playing my song on the radio
And I'm singing it to you
I'm singing it to you
If they don't have radios in heaven
Here's what I'll do
I can bring my guitar when my time is up
And I'll play it for you
I'll play it for you, you, you, you

Tell me, can you hear me now?
If not, then I can try to sing real loud
What's it like up on the other side of the clouds?
I hope I'm just like you
I hope I turn out to be as good as you

And do they have radios in heaven?
I hope they do
'Cause they're playing my song on the radio
And I'm singing it to you
I'm singing it to you
If they don't have radios in heaven
Here's what I'll do
I can bring my guitar when my time is up
And I'll play it for you
I'll play it for you, you, you, you
You, you, you
You, you, you
I'll play it for you
Radios in heaven
I hope they do
