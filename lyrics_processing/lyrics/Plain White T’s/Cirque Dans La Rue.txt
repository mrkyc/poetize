Take me to the big show
Take me anywhere but here
Put me in the front row
Make my problems disappear
Trapeze, high wire
Without a safety net
For the price of admission
I wanna witness life or death

All the pretty girls get cut in half
While the sad clowns make us laugh

I wanna make friends with the freaks
I wanna throw down with the clowns that I meet
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
Invite all the carnies and the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies and the fire-breathers
All the people just like me

Are you ready to risk it all
And be a human cannonball?
Sharpen up those knives
And throw them at the fool against the wall
We're all against that wall

I wanna make friends with the freaks
I wanna throw down with the clowns that I meet
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
Invite all the carnies and the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies and the fire-breathers
All the people just like me

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Come one, come all to the Cirque Dans La Rue
Check your troubles at the door
You don't need 'em anymore!
Leave reality outside and come along for the ride
But just remember
While you're watching us
Do the things that we do
We're watching you

All the pretty girls get cut in half
While the sad clowns make us laugh
All the pretty girls get cut in half
While the sad clowns make us laugh
I wanna make friends with the freaks
I wanna throw down with the clowns that I meet
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
Invite all the carnies and the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies and the fire-breathers
All the people just like me
Just like me
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
Invite all the carnies and the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies and the fire-breathers
