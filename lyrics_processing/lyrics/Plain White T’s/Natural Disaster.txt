She said she saw me on TV
This girl's a legend in the late night scene
And you can see she aimed to please
'Cause she just wouldn't take her eyes off me
She made the music come to life
She moved her body like a butcher knife
Chopping up every guy in sight
She was mysterious
I could not resist to save my life

I don't know what this girl was after
She's a natural, natural disaster
She's so sexy
I had to have her
She's a natural, natural disaster
Natural disaster

Now when she left me on the floor
She knew I'd follow her right out that door
She'd always leave you craving more
Just the addiction I've been waiting for
You might also likeShe made the music come to life
Staring me down with those electric eyes
And when she said 'Your place or mine?'
I was delirious, I could not resist to save my life

I don't know what this girl was after
She's a natural, natural disaster
She's so sexy
I had to have her
She's a natural, natural disaster
Natural disaster

All my love
What's your name?
What's your game?
Show me how to play
All night long
'Cause I can see you and me going all the way
All night long
And I don't even really care what you're after
All night long
As long as you keep going faster and faster

She said she saw me on TV
This girl's a legend in the late night scene
And you can see she aimed to please
'Cause she just wouldn't take her eyes off me
I don't know what this girl was after
She's a natural, natural disaster
She's so sexy
I had to have her
She's a natural, natural disaster
Natural disaster
I don't know what this girl was after
She's a natural, natural disaster
She's so sexy
I had to have her
She's a natural, natural disaster
