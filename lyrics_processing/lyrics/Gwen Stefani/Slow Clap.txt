I'll be David, you Goliath
Set the rule and I'll defy it
You be angry, I'll be quiet
You be purple, I'm the violet
Take a ride 'cause I'm the co-pilot
I'm the ice cream, you just the diet
Be the captain, I'll be the pirate
You're Billy the Kid, and I'll be the Wyatt

Are you rooting for me like I'm rooting for you?
Let me hear you get loud like surround sound

Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, de-clap, de-clap, clap, slow clap
Walk into the room like a boss, slow clap
Puttin' on a little extra sauce, slow clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, de-clap, de-clap, clap, slow clap
Side stepping people down the hall, slow clap
Winter, Spring or Summer or the Fall, slow clap

Been the champion, rang the bell
Rocked the bottom, been through hell
Climbed the mountain, now I'm well
I just feel like coming back for the belt
I've been slipping and slipping
But now I'm back for double dipping
Who'm I kidding, I'm winning
My gentleman is for myself
I'm throwin' a Hail Mary to no one else
That's why I'm cheering for myself (Come on)

I don't wanna go to the back of the line
No, no, I put in my time
From the garage to the penthouse girls
Underdog to the top of the world
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

Winter, Spring or Summer or the Fall, no, no
Slow clap
