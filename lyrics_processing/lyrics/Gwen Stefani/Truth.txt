I really don't wanna embarrass myself
And no one's gonna believe me, not even myself
And they're all gonna say I'm rebounding
So rebound all over me, cause I don't want nobody else
And I know we said we're gonna live in the moment
And that's all good, that's what we agreed, I know it
And every day I believe in you and me, more and more
And it's crazy, that's for sure, whipped

Thank you for saving me
I can't believe it, thank you

So this is what the truth feels like
This is more of what I had in mind
Yeah, this is what the truth feels like
And I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it
Something about this just feels so right, alright?
Something about this just feels so right, alright?
So this is what the truth feels like
And I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it

Oh, it's unexplainable and it's so weird
Woah, it's so strange, confusing, and I'm so scared
But maybe I deserve this boy after all that I've been through
How can all of this be true?
