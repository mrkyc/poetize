Where would I be, boy, if you didn't love me, boy?
If you didn't love me, boy?

I was drifting up then you pulled me in
Lightning on my skin, oh
Turn me on just like a switch, now you got me lit
Oh, no, you didn't

Just so you know, boy
I want a shot of your vitamin
Fill up my solo
Cup when I'm feeling so lonely
I'm losing my control
I need some water, so water me
I need some water, so water me
Uh

Where would I be, boy, if you didn't love me, boy?
If you didn't love me, boy?
Where would I be, boy, if you didn't love me, boy?
If you didn't love me, boy?
