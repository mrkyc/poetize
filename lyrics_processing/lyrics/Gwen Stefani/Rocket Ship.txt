Here we go...

You've been wrapping these chains around me
On a leash, thinking I'd obey
I know exactly what you think about me
That I wouldn't, that I couldn't escape
Just like helium in my body
To the top, I'mma elevate
I know exactly what you heard about me
That I wouldn't, that I couldn't escape
But...

I'm taking this rocket ship to the moon
And damn my whole crew coming with me (coming with me)
We're getting so high up here from the fumes
And damn my whole crew coming with me (coming with me)
Here in this rocket ship, here in my rocket ship, uh huh
Here in my rocket ship, here in my rocket ship, uh huh

Look at me rising, I'm not even trying, like woah-woah-woah
Look at me rising, I'm not even trying, like woah-woah-woah

Looking down to the ground from a distance
I think I made a clean getaway
Waving goodbye, blowing kisses
While we sipping, while we sipping champagne
Watch me going up, I'm out of sight
Get out my way-eh-eh-eh

I'm taking this rocket ship to the moon
And damn my whole crew coming with me (coming with me)
