I'm pretending I'm falling in love, falling in love
That's how I do, I do
I need a distraction, a distraction
And I, I choose you, choose you

Living in a dream don't mean anything
My brain's unorganized
I'm using you temporarily
'Cause we keep locking eyes
What planet am I on?
I'm only human
I'm about to lose my mind
I'm about to lose my mind
I'm about to lose my mind

Pull over on the side of the road
I'm texting you on my telephone
Got my windows down
Guess I'm not going home
Guess I'm not going home
No, I'm not going home

And I can't turn it off, it off
It's nothing more than what it is
And what it is, is just because
So I'm...

There's no way in the world
That I would ever think
That I would have this feeling
That I'm having right now
OK, do you understand it, what?
