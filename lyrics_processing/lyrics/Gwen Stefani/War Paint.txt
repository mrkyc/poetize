Look in the mirror super close, magnify, self-diagnose
Seeing things I never saw before
In preparation to get clear, 'bout to take on a new frontier
Leave it here, I don't need no souvenir

Decorate my skin
Some scars you just can't cover up
Here I am again
This time I just have had enough

I'm running late, put on my war paint
'Cause I'm getting ready for the combat
Get out my way, got on my war paint
'Cause I'm getting ready for the combat
With each stroke I take, I put on my face
I'll make a mistake then a Q-tip, erase
It's not that I'm fake, it's just my war paint, yeah
I'm getting ready for the combat

I'm going tribal
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya
I'm going tribal
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya

I've had my share of tragedies
Watching my mascara bleed
But I got some tricks way up my sleeve
Tip-toeing in through the minefields
I'm so scared of how this feels
I'm so scared of how I feel

Decorate my skin
Decorate my face
Some scars you just can't cover up
Here I am again
This time I just have had enough

I'm running late, put on my war paint
'Cause I'm getting ready for the combat
Get out my way, got on my war paint
'Cause I'm getting ready for the combat

I'm going tribal
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya
I'm going tribal
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya
I am getting ready

I'm running late, put on my war paint
'Cause I'm getting ready for the combat
Get out my way, got on my war paint
'Cause I'm getting ready for the combat
With each stroke I take, I put on my face
I'll make a mistake then a Q-tip, erase
It's not that I'm fake, it's just my war paint, yeah
I'm getting ready for the combat

I'm going tribal
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya
I'm going tribal
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya
I'm going tribal
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya
I'm going tribal
On ya, on ya, on ya, on ya, on ya
