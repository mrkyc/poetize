Uh oh, I see you
Hide behind your glasses, see you love the shade
Shady so long that Mister Shady is your name
Shipping it off, contain it, seal it
Rip up the receipt
But somehow it always finds its way right back to me

Thinking that nobody, nobody, nobody knows
But I got your number, I got your codes
This ain't my first time at the rodeo, hello
You're sliding, you slide on a slippery slope
Karma police, I'm on patrol
Got my gun loaded, I'm ready to go
I'm dope

You see this finger wagging, wagging at you
The naughty, naughty things you do
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, you hid it
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you
The naughty, naughty things you do
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, admit it

You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...

I think there's something that you might perhaps forgot to say
Locked in the closet but it never goes away
No matter how hard you try, you're never washing out the stain
Because you're addicted, so addicted to the shame

Thinking that nobody, nobody, nobody knows
But I got your number, I got your codes
This ain't my first time at the rodeo, hello
You're sliding, you slide on a slippery slope
Karma police, I'm on patrol
Got my gun loaded, I'm ready to go
I'm dope

You see this finger wagging, wagging at you
The naughty, naughty things you do
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, you hid it
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you
The naughty, naughty things you do
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, admit it

You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You try to sneak it, hide it and seek it
Put it in the past, try to antique it
Dirty secrets, you tried to clean it
Put one over fast but you can't bleach it

You see this finger wagging, wagging at you
The naughty, naughty things you do
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, you hid it
You see this finger wagging, wagging at you
The naughty, naughty things you do
You did it, you did it, and then you hid it, admit it

You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh... (Whoa!)
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh... (Ah, Oh my god)
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh... (Ah, Oh my god)
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh... (Ah, Oh my god)
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
You've been naughty, uh, huh, uh...
