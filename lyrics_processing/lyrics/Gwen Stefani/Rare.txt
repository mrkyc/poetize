You're a sapphire
You're a rolling stone
You're a sparkle in a deep black hole
You're like moon shine when the curtains close
You're my answer, one that no one knows

And I can't believe it, that you even exist
You know I would be dumb to give perfection up
How can I accept it, that this is so precious?
You know I would be dumb to give perfection up

You're rare
And I'm loving every second of it, don't you know?
You're rare
And only a stupid girl would let it go
You're so good and you don't even know it
You're so good and you don't even know
You're rare
And only a stupid girl would let it go, don't you know?

I am broken
I am insecure
Complicated, oh yeah, that's for sure
I feel worthless
I've been hurt so bad
I get nervous you won't love me back

Do you really think you wanna make some new memories?
