Buried in your carelessness, how did I get so deep?
Now I am covered in the rubble of your selfish concrete
All of it's been recorded forever in my mind
In a way it's all permanent and frozen for all time
Don't you dare try to rush me, I'm not ready for the fade
I'm washing in the sorrow, yeah that's where I wanna bathe
I'm practicing my problems, I'm worshipping the pain
Memorizing, agonizing

This is crazy
I knew it, knew it, knew it
This is crazy
I knew it all along
And no you can't undo it, do it, do it
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Watch what I'ma do
I'm going to prove with somebody new
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable
Watch what I'ma do
I'm going to prove with somebody new
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable

Can't even miss you, 'cause you're not the person that I thought you were
On the top of Sapphire Mountain and I'm mining through the hurt
You're so guilty, come on just surrender, talking in circles
Did I love you, I can't remember

This is crazy
I knew it, knew it, knew it
This is crazy
I knew it all along
And no you can't undo it, do it, do it
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Watch what I'ma do
I'm going to prove with somebody new
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable
Watch what I'ma do
I'm going to prove with somebody new
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable

Can you handle it, someone else on my lips
Can you handle it, eh?
Can you handle it, someone else on my lips
Can you handle it, eh?
Can't even miss you, 'cause you're not the person that I thought you were
Never thought you were
Never thought you were
Watch what I'ma do
I'm going to prove with somebody new
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable
Watch what I'ma do
I'm going to prove with somebody new
That I'm loveable, loveable, loveable

Can you handle it, someone else on my lips
Can you handle it, eh?
Can you handle it, someone else on my lips
