I am awakening like a rosebud flowering
Look at me, I'm turning on, buzzing like a neon
Flickering on again, lightening in the dark

You're helping me forget, what is this?
Gonna break out my cocoon
I'm gonna take a risk, skinny dip
Cause I see you're on the loose

Gonna lasso you, gonna lasso you
Gonna get some pleasure, to-to-together

Must be a sign
All the energy's pulling me right back to you
Tonight, gonna bottle you up and wear it like perfume
Alright, we going in, it's what we supposed to do
Tonight, open wide

Splash
I'm diving in, diving in
I'm diving in
Splash
I'm diving in, diving in
I'm diving in

Breathing you, breathing me
Going with the flow

You're helping me forget, what is this?
Gonna break out my cocoon
I'm gonna take a risk, skinny dip
