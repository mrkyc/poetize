C'est pas possible cet amour
C'est incroyable
Tu me fais transpirer
C'est parfait

Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury
I only wanna fly first-class desires, you're my limousine
So elegant, the way we ride
Our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look, I'm livin' like a queen

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, baby
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin' in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in my rough, is lookin' so sparkly

Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback
(Slim Thuga)

I made my stacks, now I finally get to lay back (Get to lay back)
I worked so hard, now I finally get the payback (Get the payback)
And blaze sex, ridin' in back of the Maybach (Chyea)
If it ain't 'dro, I say no, we don't play that (We don't play that)
I'm in my house like a Boss reclined
Puffin' on the sticky green, sippin' on me some wine (Sippin' on me some wine)
I made it out the hood and I'm feelin' real good about it (Huh)
Ridin' in the Benz, tryna pull the wood up out it (Chyea)

This kind of love is getting expensive

The payback, the payback
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We're loaded and we're not gonna blow it
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We're hooked up with the love 'cause we grow it
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We burn it, you and I, we are so lit

We're so rich in love, we're rollin in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in my rough, is lookin' so sparkly

Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

T'es si jolie
C'est pas possible
(Do you feel it?)
C'est jamais assez
C'est jamais assez pour me faire plein
Toutes les choses
Tu me fais sentir
C'est parfait, je suis plein avec toi
