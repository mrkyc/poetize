Whoa, check it out
Look at you
Big boy

I'm making it easy for you to go give my love away
Spend the check before it even hits the bank
This is what happens when you don't hear what your mother say
The signs, the signs, the signs, the signs
It's you doing it, choosing it, no excuse
How you doing it, ruins it, now you lose
This is what happens when you living with no consequence
The signs, the signs, the signs, the signs

Big mistake, red flags cry
Right there, but I close my eyes
Carelessly, I let it slide
A little late, warning signs
Right there, but I close my eyes
Punish me, I let it slide

You know how to spend it
You know how to blow it up, blow it up, blow it up
It's getting so expensive
You know how to screw it up, screw it up, screw it up
Up, up, up, up
Screw it up, up, up, up
Look at you

I'm putting my money on you, I don't underestimate
I'm not a rookie, I'm so used to getting played
What do I do? I'm not a typical or classic case
I try, I try, I try, I try

How I'm doing it, choosing it, no excuse
How I'm doing it, ruins it, now I lose
This is what happens when you don't have any common sense
The signs, the signs, the signs, the signs

Big mistake, red flags cry
Right there, but I close my eyes
Carelessly, I let it slide

You know how to spend it
You know how to blow it up, blow it up, blow it up
It's getting so expensive
You know how to screw it up, screw it up, screw it up
Up, up, up, up
Screw it up, up, up, up

Big mistake, red flags cry
Right there, but I close my eyes
Carelessly, I let it slide

You know how to spend it
You know how to blow it up, blow it up, blow it up
It's getting so expensive
You know how to screw it up, screw it up, screw it up
Up, up, up, up
