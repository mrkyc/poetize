Cuz the rain keeps comin', yeah the rain keeps comin'
I must've called you 99 times but I couldn't get through
And the rain keeps comin', yeah the rain keeps comin'
And the rain keeps comin', yeah the rain keeps comin'
Nothin's ever for certain 'til the levee breaks down
The water comes in and the river, the river takes the town
There's a shelter at the high school gym, they got blankets and food
But you won't sleep easy, no you won't sleep easy
It's been a few days since I heard any word from you
No and I don't sleep easy, no I don't sleep easy
And the rain keeps comin', yeah the rain keeps comin'
And the rain keeps comin', yeah the rain keeps comin'
And nothin's ever for certain 'til the levee breaks down
The water comes in and the river, the river takes the town
And the river takes the town
Yeah the river takes the town
The river takes the town
There's a number you can call if your house get's washed away
But it'll never be the same, no it'll never be the same
Since you held my hand and kissed me on the very first day
No I'll never be the same, no I'll never be the same
And the rain keeps comin' (never be the same), and the rain keeps comin' (never be the same)
And the rain keeps comin' (I'll never be the same), and the rain keeps comin'
And the rain keeps comin' (I'll never be the same), and the rain keeps comin' (never be the same)
