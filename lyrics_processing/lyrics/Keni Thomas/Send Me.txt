Is marked by more than 40,000 white crosses; 40,000 dead Americans
-----------------------------------------
We were young and soldiers called to dedicate our lives
In the name of God and country
Do what's just boys, go do what's right
A hard band of brothers waiting on our chance
To add one more page onto the victory dance
Here am I, Lord send me, send me
Victory lies in the spirit of the lives of the men who died for me
Well we stood upon the ramparts, and we fought to save ourselves
But the price one pays for victory, Lord I know it all, I know it all too well
And they may call us heroes, but only those who've been will know
I would give my life for the man beside me
Just to bring my brother, yeah bring him home
Here am I, send me
Send me
Victory lies in the spirit of the lives of the men who died for me
Yeah, send me
Yeah, send me
Send me
Oh, send me, Lord
Victory lies in the spirit of the lives of the men who died for me
Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Father forgive us all we have been through, we band of brothers
Yeah, we band of brothers
And now the bows have all been broken
And the warriors come home
But if they called again
Who would answer then, like my Daddy did
So many years before
Here am I, Lord send me
Send me
Victory lies in the spirit of the lives of the men who died for me
Yeah, send me
Yeah, send me
Oh, send me
Oh, send me, Lord
Victory lies in the spirit of the lives of the men who died for me
Send me
Oh, Lord send me
Oh, send me
Send me
Victory lies in the spirit of the lives of the men who died for me
Hey, send me
Why don't you send me
Come on send me
Here am I, send me
Victory lies in the spirit of the lives of the men who died for me
Oh, send me
Oh, send me
Oh, send me
Send me
Victory lies in the spirit of the lives of the men who died for me
Oh, send me
Oh, send me
