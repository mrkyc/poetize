Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom

Zoom, zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby, don't rush
You can look but don't touch

You think you know
When you see me in my videos
How the story goes
But that's just the side that I expose
Look through the lens
You see my body, not who I am
So don't pretend
And try to act like you're my boyfriend

You wanna get somewhere? (Somewhere)
Then, boy, don't touch me there (Touch me there)
Just get up close and personal (Personal)
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

Zoom, zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby, don't rush
You can look but don't touch
Zoom, zoom into my head
Gotta know me to be my man
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

You won't behave
You're gettin' all up in my space
Barely know your name
You're tryin' to score but it's not a game
Boy, get a clue
Yeah, you gotta spend the time, pay your dues
Following the rules
If you want me to wanna be with you

You wanna get somewhere? (Somewhere)
Then, boy, don't touch me there (Touch me there)
Just get up close and personal (Personal)

Zoom, zoom into my head
Gotta know me to be my man
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch (But don't)
Zoom, zoom in under my skin (Don't touch, no, no)
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby, don't rush (Baby, don't rush)
You can look but don't touch (Touch)
Zoom, zoom into my head
Gotta know me to be my man
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch (Don't touch)

Don't you dare
Touch me there
If you want to get somewhere
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

(Zoom in, get to know me, boy, don't rush)
Baby, don't rush
You can look but don't touch
Zoom, zoom into my head (Zoom in if you want me, boy, don't touch)
Gotta know me to be my man
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch (But don't)
Zoom, zoom in under my skin (Don't touch, no, no)
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby, don't rush (Baby, don't rush)
You can look but don't touch
Zoom, zoom into my head
Gotta know me to be my man (Oh)
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch
No, no
