I got these feelings I try to bury down
But they keep screamin'
And I'm just tryna filter out somehow
But they don't wanna leave
No, you don't need it
All the jealousy and ugly feelings
Left from my history
I try so hard, but they get the best of me

And you got every reason to walk out the door
But you'd rather be next to me with...

All the voices in my head
Always try to break me
Fuck me up and change me
But talk is cheap
This is the last time I listen to the voices in my head
I know they never stop talking
Always sabotaging
But talk is cheap
This is the last time I listen to the voices in my head

And when we're fighting
They get in the way
And start a fire
But you never let us burn away
You got me figured out
You might also like
And you got every reason to walk out the door
But you'd rather be next to me with...

All the voices in my head
Always try to break me
Fuck me up and change me
But talk is cheap
This is the last time I listen to the voices in my head
I know they never stop talking
Always sabotaging
But talk is cheap
This is the last time I listen to the voices in my head

They say that I'll never be ready for love
They say that I never will feel like enough
Yeah, they lie to me and they lie to you
But you know the truth is
They say that I'll never be ready for love
They say that I never will feel like enough
Yeah, they lie to me and they lie to you
But you know the truth is

And you got every reason to walk out the door
But you'd rather be next to me with...
All the voices in my head
Always try to break me
Fuck me up and change me
But talk is cheap
This is the last time I listen to the voices in my head
I know they never stop talking
Always sabotaging
But talk is cheap
