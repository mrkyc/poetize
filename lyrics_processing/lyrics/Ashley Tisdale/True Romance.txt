You make me wanna kiss you
But you make me wanna slap you
You can give me butterflies
And you make me wanna fight
Every day, it feels brand new
There are days you act real sweet
Other days you act real mean
You bring out my wild side
But on days I'm not alright
You can make me feel carefree

True romance is up and down, yeah
Up and down, yeah, up and down, yeah
All that counts is here and now, yeah
Here and now, yeah, here and now, yeah
Though you can drive me mad, you know I love you
I'm sure I do some things that really bug you
True romance is up and down, yeah, up and down, yeah
Up and down, yeah

You love driving me crazy
But you know that you can tame me
Put my patience to the test
Every time you make a mess
When you're acting real lazy
Yeah, you got an "I don't care" vibe
Life with you is such a fun ride
Good or bad is not the point
You can flip it like a coin
In the end we're still alright

Up and down, yeah, up and down, yeah
All that counts is here and now, yeah
Here and now, yeah, here and now, yeah
Though you can drive me mad, you know I love you
I'm sure I do some things that really bug you
True romance is up and down, yeah, up and down, yeah

You're the one that I come home to
And it's always gonna be you
Everything is all blue skies
'Til you make me wanna kill you
You're the one that I come home to
And it's always gonna be you
Everything is all blue skies
'Til you make me wanna kill you

True romance is up and down, yeah
Up and down, yeah, up and down, yeah
All that counts is here and now, yeah
Here and now, yeah, here and now
Though you can drive me mad, you know I love you
I'm sure I do some things that really bug you
True romance is up and down, yeah, up and down, yeah
