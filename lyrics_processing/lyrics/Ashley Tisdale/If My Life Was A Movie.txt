If my life was a movie, I would script it so differently
Starting with the scene where you left me (Left me)
See, I changed the part where I break down in tears, yeah
If my life was a movie

I would be so cool
I wouldn't miss you
I wouldn't hate you like I do
I would just move on
I would be so strong
I would be better without you
'Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should
And it's all good

If my life was a movie, it would not be, no tragedy
I will never let you get to me
I would ride up in the sunset, you'd be easy, easy to forget
If I produced it, directed it

I would be so cool
I wouldn't miss you
I wouldn't hate you like I do
I would just move on
I would be so strong
I would be better without you
'Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should
And it's all good
Hollywood, it's all good, good, good, good

I would be so cool
I wouldn't hate you
I would just move on
I would be better without you

I'd be cool, we'd be through
'Cause I wanted us to
I'd be strong, you'd be gone
Because I left you
I would not break down
I just wouldn't know how
I wouldn't miss a thing
'Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should

I would be so cool
I wouldn't miss you
I wouldn't hate you like I do
I would just move on
I would be so strong
I would be better without you
'Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should
It's all good
Hollywood, it's all good, Hollywood
'Cause in Hollywood, things always end up like they should
