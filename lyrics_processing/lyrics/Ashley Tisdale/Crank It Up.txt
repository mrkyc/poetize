Crank it up
I like that
Ah
Yeah

Th-th-this beat is hypnotic
I wanna ride it like a chauffeur
The sound of the sonics
Controllin' me just like a robot
I go bionic, so d-d-DJ put it on
I'm losin' logic and cruisin' deeper in the zone

It's so cinematic, charismatic
It got me frozed up
This acrobatic beat is somethin'
I need a dose of
I'm systematically movin' every single bone
There's no mechanic that can understand what I'm on

Let's crank it up, crank it up
'Til the walls cave in
Just crank it up, crank it up
Put that record on spin
'Cause I am ready to party
Gonna get my girls and get naughty
Just crank it up, crank it up
'Til the walls cave in
Just crank it up

Oh, oh, oh whoa
Oh, oh, oh whoa (Crank it up)
Oh, oh, oh whoa
Oh, oh, oh whoa

Th-th-this beat is melodic, harmonic
Got me strikin' poses
I get up on it electronically
Feelin' so fresh
It's so erotic, my body's like a cyclone
I'm like a puppet, can't stop it
Droppin' like a stone

It's so cinematic, charismatic
It got me frozed up
This acrobatic beat is somethin'
I need a dose of
I'm systematically movin' every single bone
There's no mechanic that can understand what I'm on

Let's crank it up, crank it up
'Til the walls cave in
Just crank it up, crank it up
Put that record on spin
'Cause I am ready to party
Gonna get my girls and get naughty
Just crank it up, crank it up
'Til the walls cave in
Just crank it up
Turn it up louder
Turn it up louder
Turn it up
DJ, turn it up louder
Turn it up louder
Turn it up louder
DJ, turn it up louder
Turn it up louder
Turn it up louder
Louder, louder
Turn it up, yeah

Let's crank it up, crank it up (Oh)
'Til the walls cave in
Just crank it up, crank it up
Put that record on spin
'Cause I am ready to party (Yeah)
Gonna get my girls and get naughty
Just crank it up, crank it up (I wanna crank it up)
'Til the walls cave in
Just crank it up

I systematically move every bone
So crank it up, I wanna get in the zone
I systematically move every bone
