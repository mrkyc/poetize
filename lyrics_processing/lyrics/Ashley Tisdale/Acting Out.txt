Up above the surface, I was just a perfect child
But underneath it all, I was craving to be wild
Don't you judge by the cover, it's so far from what you see
I'm losing all my patience, waiting on you to believe

I'm suffocating
I can't breathe

Let me out this cage, I'm not gonna hold back
I'ma break these chains, I'm taking control
Not gonna give you something to talk about
It's another side of me, I'm acting out
Set me free, I'm ready to show you
This is what I need, it's time to get dirty
I'ma show you what I'm talking about
It's another side of me, I'm acting out

Welcome to a new beginning, it's time to start the show
No, I don't think it matters if it's real or just a role
Once you get a taste of it, you'll be begging me for more
I'll give you something to remember once I hit the floor
You might also like
I'm letting go of what you know

Let me out this cage, I'm not gonna hold back
I'ma break these chains, I'm taking control
Not gonna give you something to talk about
It's another side of me, I'm acting out
Set me free, I'm ready to show you
This is what I need, it's time to get dirty
I'm gonna show you what I'm talking about
It's another side of me, I'm acting out

I've been waitin' just to drive you crazy
Now it's my time, and yes, it feels amazing (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
There's nothing left of what you've seen before (Yeah, yeah)
Life's too short just to do what you're told (What you're told)
Just to do what you're told
Just to do what you're told (Do what you're told)
Just to do what you're told
Do what, do what you're told

Let me out this cage, I'm not gonna hold back
I'ma break these chains, I'm taking control
Not gonna give you something to talk about
It's another side of me, I'm acting out
Set me free, I'm ready to show you
This is what I need, oh, it's time to get dirty
I'm gonna show you what I'm talking about
It's another side of me, I'm acting out
Life's too short just to do what you're told (I'm acting out)
Life's too short just to do what you're told (I'm acting out)
Life's too short just to do what you're told (I'm acting out)
