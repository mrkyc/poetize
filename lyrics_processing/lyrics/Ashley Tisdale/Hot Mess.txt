I'm a mess when it comes to you
I've got no inhibitions whatsoever, it's true
I'm not the kinda girl who runs around like this
Caught up in a kiss, best friends with benefits, no

But you're so racy, you're my favorite guy
So unruly, so uncivilized
Cupid got me right between my eyes
You know you got bit real bad
Doing things that you never did

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
You wake up in your bra and your make-up
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Car's in the driveway, parked sideways
Yeah, I know this is killing me
I'm leaving every piece of my conscience behind
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm such a hot mess, I'm such a hot mess
I'm such a hot mess with you

With you, I never knew
Loving you could be so fun
It's true
I was such a good, good girl
Before you came along (Uh-uh, oh)
You might also like
But you're so racy, you're my favorite guy
So unruly, so uncivilized
Cupid got me right between my eyes
You know you got bit real bad
Doing things that you never did

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
You wake up in your bra and your make-up
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Car's in the driveway, parked sideways
Yeah, I know this is killing me
I'm leaving every piece of my conscience behind
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm such a hot mess, I'm such a hot mess
I'm such a hot mess with you

I'm getting speeding tickets
I'm acting just like a misfit
I'm letting my mail pile up to the ceiling
You're making me irresponsible (Ah)
'Cause I just wanna be with you (Ah)
Act rambunctious and see what I'd do (Ah)
Go hard, hit that gas
Live your life like it's all you have
Push, push harder, make it last
All this love is worth the mess
Hot mess
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
You wake up in your bra and your make-up
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Car's in the driveway, parked sideways
Yeah, I know this is killing me
I'm leaving every piece of my conscience behind
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm such a hot mess, I'm such a hot mess
