You see my shadow, you see my steps
Only a glimpse, you wonder what I'll do next
You see my essence, you see my glow
My thoughts at night are things you'll never know

Don't believe what you read
Don't believe what you hear
Things are not what they seem
Only what they appear
You don't see what I see
When I look in the mirror
You might think you know me
But you have no idea

You need a different kind of looking glass (Looking glass)
To see through me (See through me), into me (Into me)
You need a different kind of looking glass (Looking glass)
To see through me (See through me), into me (Into me)

I've got my monsters, my skeletons
Chained to my mind, pray they don't come undone
I've got my secrets, buried them deep
Some things are private, only meant for me
You might also like
Don't believe what you read
Don't believe what you hear
Things are not what they seem
Only what they appear
You don't see what I see
When I look in the mirror
You might think you know me
But you have no idea

You need a different kind of looking glass (Looking glass)
To see through me (See through me), into me (Into me)
You need a different kind of looking glass (Looking glass)
To see through me (See through me), into me (Into me)

You can't know my story
'Less you lived it for me
You can't know my story
'Less you lived it for me

You need a different kind of looking glass (Looking glass)
To see through me (See through me), into me (Into me)
You need a different kind of looking glass (Looking glass)
To see through me (See through me), into me (Into me)
Looking glass
See through me
