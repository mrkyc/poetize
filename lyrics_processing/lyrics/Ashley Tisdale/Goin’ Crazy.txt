Something about your style, got me freaking out
(Hey boy, hey boy)
Gotta make your mind and there ain't no doubt
(Hey boy, hey boy)
You're really laid back and you play it smooth
(Hey boy, hey boy)
I see the way you move from across the room
And I know I'm tripping on you

Boy, I'm feeling something real and I don't know what to do
So excited, I can't hide it
Got my eyes on you

You got me goin' crazy
Wanna be your baby
I don't know what to do
I can't take my eyes off you
You got me goin' crazy
It's just the way you're moving
I really wish you knew what you do
I can't take my eyes off you

You're so sensational, think you've got it all
(Hey boy, hey boy)
And I like the way you're unpredictable
(Hey boy, hey boy)
Won't you come to me, just like I wished?
(Hey boy, hey boy)
'Cause I never met a guy who made me feel like this
It's a chance that I just can't miss, oh
