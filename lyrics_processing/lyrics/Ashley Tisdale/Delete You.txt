It's not time to give us one more try (I don't think so)
Last night you said your one last lie
I can't let you wreck my plans
I'm planning to let you go
Oh, only one thing is true
Only one thing to do
Time to delete you

Burnin' up
All your pictures
Tearin' up
All your letters
Rippin' up
All your sweaters
This is, this is for the better
Slashin' up
All your tires
Smashin' up
All your flowers
Grabbing back
All my power
Press the button that says, "I don't need you"
Delete you
Oh (Oh), delete you, oh (Oh)
You might also like
It's not time to say how much you care (I don't think so)
I don't want you, I want you not there
I'm done, I think that the time's come
To bring this thing to an end
I think this could be goodbye
Think you've run outta time
Time to delete you

Burnin' up
All your pictures
Tearin' up
All your letters
Rippin' up
All your sweaters
This is, this is for the better
Slashin' up
All your tires
Smashin' up
All your flowers
Grabbing back
All my power
Press the button that says, "I don't need you"
Delete you (Delete you)
All I want from you is for you to disappear (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
All I need from you is for you to not be here (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I guess it's time you got the news
Gonna replace you (Oh), erase you (Oh)
Delete you, delete you
Oh-oh, delete you
Whoa, oh-oh, delete you

Burnin' up
All your pictures
Tearin' up
All your letters
Rippin' up
All your sweaters
This is, this is for the better
Slashin' up
All your tires
Smashin' up
All your flowers
Grabbing back
All my power
Press the button that says, "I don't need you"
Delete you (Oh-oh)
Delete you
Whoa, oh (Oh-oh)
Delete you
Whoa, oh (Oh-oh)
Delete you
Time to delete you
Oh (Oh-oh)
