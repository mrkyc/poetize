Kiss the girl
Kiss the girl

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why, but you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl
Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know ya do
It's possible she wants you too
There is one way to ask her
It don't take a word, not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl (Kiss the girl)

Sha-la-la-la-la-la, my, oh my
Looks like the boy's too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, ain't that sad?
It's such a shame, too bad

You're gonna miss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl (Kiss the girl)

Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word and she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl (Kiss the girl)

Sha-la-la-la-la-la, my, oh my
Looks like the boy's too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, ain't that sad?

You're gonna miss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, don't be scared
You better be prepared
Go on and kiss the girl

Don't try to hide it how
