Hello?
Hey, you know what? I dont need this
And I cannot believe you!
Over her? And why you gotta lie about it?
Thats it, I'm over it!

Everytime I saw you trying to pretend
Now I think you're caught in a spin
Said that I could trust you'd be my everything
Falling from the shadows
Now I see

All those times were wasted
When you tried to hide it from me

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it
So, why is it so hard to see
All the lies you tell me?
I'm getting out, I'm moving on
I'm over it
You might also like
Try to walk away, but my heart was saying no
Can't believe it took so long to go
Now the past is fading, I hardly know your name
Don't know what you're doing
Ya lost the game

All those times were wasted
When you tried to hide it from me

I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it
So, why is it so hard to see
All the lies you tell me?
I'm getting out, I'm moving on
I'm over it

I don't care... never
I'm over it
So why is it...(yeah-yeah) get it?
I'm over it (Heeey!)
I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it
So, why is it so hard to see
All the lies you tell me?
I'm getting out, I'm moving on
I'm over it
I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're doin'
Never really had me
I'm over it
So, why is it so hard to see
All the lies you tell me?
I'm getting out, I'm moving on
I'm over it

I'm over it
I'm over it
