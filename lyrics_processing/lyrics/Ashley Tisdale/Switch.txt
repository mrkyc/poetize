Switch it, switch it

You're out of this world, I'm sure of it
A crazy intuition
You're off and on
You're here then gone, come back
A curious condition

And then you switch right over
It's weird, yeah, I know, but
Just can't get a hold of myself

Hey (Hey), so strange
You switched in front of me
Hey (Hey), you've changed
Not like you used to be
'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here, you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Hey (Hey), you're just talking like a machine
Hey (Hey), I'm stuck on every word in between
'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here, you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
You might also like
You're out of this world, I'm sure of it
A little more than different
And you keep locking, blocking, turn your back
It's you that I am missing

And then you switch right over
It's weird, yeah, I know, but
Just can't get a hold of myself

Hey (Hey), so strange
You switched in front of me
Hey (Hey), you've changed
Not like you used to be
'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here, you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Hey (Hey), you're just talking like a machine
Hey (Hey), I'm stuck on every word in between
'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here, you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Wonder where you are, how I can find you?
Staring at the stars, falling behind you
Across the universe, hope you'll be back soon
I got a feeling our planets will be rearranging

Hey (Hey), so strange
You switched in front of me
Hey (Hey), you've changed
Not like you used to be
'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here, you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world
Hey (Hey), you're just talking like a machine
Hey (Hey), I'm stuck on every word in between
'Cause you get in my head and hold my heart
When I'm here, you're there, we're worlds apart
So reverse your words, get to the start
And switch back to my world

Open your heart, yeah, we're back to the start
Open your heart, yeah, get back to the start
Open your heart, yeah, we're back to the start
Open your heart, yeah, get back to the start
Open your heart, yeah, we're back to the start
