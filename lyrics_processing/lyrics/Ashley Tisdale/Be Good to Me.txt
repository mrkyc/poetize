(Oh)
Can you be good to me?
Be good, be good, be good, be good
Can you be good to me?
(TWIN)

Everyday is getting worse
Do the same things, and it hurts
I don't know if I should cry
All I know is that I'm tryin'
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you
'Cause you make it so hard to do (Oh)
What's the point of making plans?
You break all the ones we have
I don't know where we went wrong
'Cause we used to be so strong
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you

So, why can't you be, be good to me?

I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need
Somebody to be (Somebody to be)
Somebody to be good to me, good to me (Yeah)
Can you be good to me, good to me, please?

I used to think I had it all
Then one day, we hit a wall
I had hoped you were the one
Now where's my dream?
Where has it gone? (Yeah)
I wanted to be with you
Forever, just me and you

What up, what up mommy?
What it is? What's good?
I make you shine, like a star up in Hollywood
I'll be your knight in shining armour
Your prince in the saga
Never catching me bringin' drama, never that
Whoa, you run the club, like Monopoly
Smiling, looking like you won a mil of the lottery
And I'ma be good, like water to a whale
Jassy world, Miss Ashley Tisdale
Where do I go from here?
You've gotten under my skin
And I don't know how to get out of this place that I'm in

I don't ask for much
