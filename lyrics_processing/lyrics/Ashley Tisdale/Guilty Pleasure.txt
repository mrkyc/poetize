(Go)You're so treacherous and dangerous and devious
You keep me on the edge (Go)

You are my guilty pleasure
So intoxicating when and you know it isn't right
I'll keep it undercover
See the pressure's on, God, I'm so into you

Typical boys, that's what I like
And I really have to say that's (Ah)
Typical me and my appetite
For destruction, can't you see that

Any other girl but me
They would be running from a guy like you
But now you're gonna find there is no fight
What I really mean to say is... (Oh)

You are my guilty pleasure
So intoxicating when and you know it isn't right
I'll keep it undercover
See the pressure's on, God, I'm so into you
You might also like
Evidently you're unaware
Of the chemistry you're throwing out
Indirectly you have no care
And I really have no doubt that

Any other girl but me
They would be running from a guy like you
Oh, you're something that I can't do without
And I really have to say this

You are my guilty pleasure
So intoxicating when you know it isn't right
I'll keep it undercover
See the pressure's on, God, I'm so into you

You're so treacherous and dangerous and devious
You keep me on the edge

You are my guilty pleasure
So intoxicating when you know it isn't right
I'll keep it undercover
See the pressure's on, God, I'm so into you
Oh, never do without
Mmm, never do without
Mmm, never do without
Mmm, never do without
Right now you're gonna find there is no fight
What I really mean to say is...

You are my guilty pleasure
So intoxicating when you know it isn't right
I'll keep it undercover
See the pressure's on, God, I'm so into you

You're so treacherous and dangerous and devious
