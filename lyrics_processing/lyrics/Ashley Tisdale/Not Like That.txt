I feel oh-so glamorous
Lookin' super fabulous
Sometimes I'm insecure
Something I can't ignore
All the flashy cameras
Try my best to handle it
I'm just the girl next door
I can hear the rumors take off

All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they wanna be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no, it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, I'm not that girl
And it's not, not, no, it's not my world

So many girls be checking my style
Checking my style, checking my style
So many girls be checking my style
But I don't even care, no
You might also like
I move in mysterious ways that got them curious
They're looking at what I'm wearing
Standing on the sidelines staring
Taking every chance I get to find who I'm going with
I just wish they'd see what I'm like in real life

All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they wanna be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no, it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, I'm not that girl
And it's not, not, no, it's not my world

So many girls be checking my style
Checking my style, checking my style
So many girls be checking my style
But I don't even care, no

What's good?
I'm weak no longer
In life, it's making me stronger
What I like, I'ma get that like a quick cat
No, I won't quit that
You heard me
You'll find that I'm just like you
And I do the same things you do
The type of chick that hits spots in my flip-flops
Listening to hip-hop
You feel me?
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they wanna be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no, it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, I'm not that girl
And it's not, not, no, it's not my world
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
I can tell by the look that they wanna be
Be hot, hot, hot like that
But it's not, not, no, it's not like that
All the girls in the club got their eyes on me
They put me down 'cause of jealousy
But I'm not, not, I'm not that girl
