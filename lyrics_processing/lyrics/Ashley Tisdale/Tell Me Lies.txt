It's in your eyes, feelings can't be disguised
'Cause the truth makes me want you to tell me lies
My biggest fear is crying oceans of tears
I would rather you not be so sincere
How cold could you be?
What would you do if you were me?
I'm better off if it's a mystery

'Cause I don't (Don't) wanna know (Wanna know)
If I've kissed your lips for the last time
Please don't say (Don't say) if it's so (If it's so)
Tell my heart it's not goodbye
And do this one thing for me
Make up some stupid story tonight
It's alright, keep your truth and tell me lies

Something's not right, love is nowhere in sight
I'm not ready to let go, it's not time
How cruel could you be?
Don't say we're through, least not to me
I'm better off, leave it a mystery

'Cause I don't (Don't) wanna know (Wanna know)
If I've kissed your lips for the last time
Please don't say (Don't say) if it's so (If it's so)
Tell my heart it's not goodbye
And do this one thing for me
Make up some stupid story tonight
It's alright, keep your truth and tell me lies
You might also like
Don't tell me you're leaving
There's only so much I can take
It's easier if you're faking
(Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh whoa)

'Cause I don't (Don't) wanna know (Wanna know)
If I've kissed your lips for the last time
Please don't say (Don't say) if it's so (If it's so)
Tell my heart it's not goodbye (My heart it's not goodbye)
And do this one thing for me (Oh)
Make up some stupid story
Can we keep pretending?
This is not the ending tonight
It's alright, keep your truth and tell me lies

Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
