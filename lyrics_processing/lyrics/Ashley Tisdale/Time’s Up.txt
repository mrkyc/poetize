Yeah, yeah

I've played the song, now it drives me crazy
I've run the race, now I'm too damn lazy
This love of ours is so sad, it makes me laugh

Today seems a little different
Hard to say, but it looks like the end

Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes?
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train, we wait for it
Even when it's gone

We've surfed the wave, now we've hit the shore, and
We've squeezed the fruit 'til there's no more juice left
We're both so good, good at keeping up the lie
You might also like
We can get it in perspective
Kiss my lips, life is what we make it

Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes?
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train, we wait for it
Even when it's gone

As I'm waving you goodbye, I want you to smile
Save the picture in your frame, file it right next to my name
I'm willing to die for love, willing to try, but not willing to lie for love
I know that this cake's already baked, now it's burning, burning

We can get it in perspective
Kiss my lips, life is what we make it

Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut (Oh, yeah)
Didn't you know if nothing changes, nothing changes?
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
(Even when it's gone, even when it's gone)
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train, we wait for it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Even when it's gone, even when it's gone
If nothing changes, nothing changes
Time's up, promise this time I'm getting off
(Even when it's gone, even when it's gone)
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train, we wait for it
