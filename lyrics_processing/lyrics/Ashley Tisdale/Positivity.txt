From where I stand, I see a world of possibilities
So don't be going negative on me, baby
Love is hard, but that's alright
Give it time, it's worth the ride
You know
It's all in the way you

You're looking at me, I'm looking at you
What more do you want?
Show me some positivity
It's all that I got, it's leading me on
Can't leave it alone
Show me some positivity
You're making it harder than has to be
So won't you please show me some positivity?

Wish I could get into your mind so I could see if I'm inside
'Cause I know you're right here in mine, oh baby
The glass is half full, not empty
Why do you think you won't get none?
You know it's all in the way you

You're looking at me, I'm looking at you

Show me some positivity
It's all that I got, it's leading me on
Can't leave it alone
Show me some positivity
You're making it harder than has to be
So won't you please show me some positivity?
