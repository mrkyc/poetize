I don't wanna feel like this
I don't want to, I don't want to
I don't wanna freak you out, but I (But I, but I)
Think I might have said too much
Didn't mean to, didn't mean to
Think I might've said it's you, and I (And I, and I)

Guess I should leave this behind
Guess I should erase and rewind
But somehow, I can't seem to stay away
I don't wanna sound desperate, but I am
So say that you'll come around
Guess I should erase and rewind
Erase and rewind

I don't wanna stand in line
Like I used to, like I used to
I don't wanna have to scream and shout (And shout, and shout)
'Cause I'm the kind of girl that sticks like a tattoo
Like a tattoo
Yeah, I'm the kinda girl that wears you out, oh-oh

Guess I should leave this behind
Guess I should erase and rewind
But somehow, I can't seem to stay away
I don't wanna sound desperate, but I am
So say that you'll come around
Guess I should erase and rewind
Erase and rewind
You might also like
You never do return my calls
Just like we never met at all
No matter what, I'll always wait for you
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

I don't wanna feel like this
I don't want to, yeah

Guess I should leave this behind
Guess I should erase and rewind
But somehow, I can't seem to stay away
And I don't wanna sound desperate, but I am (Desperate)
So say that you'll come around
Guess I should erase and rewind
Erase, erase and rewind
Guess I should leave this behind (Yeah, behind)
Guess I should erase and rewind
But somehow, I can't seem to stay away (I can't seem to stay away)
I don't wanna sound desperate, but I am
So say that you'll come around
Guess I should erase and rewind
