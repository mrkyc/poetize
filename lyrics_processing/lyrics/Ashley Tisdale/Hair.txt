I'm in disarray, I'm unkempt
And I love the sugar
Yeah, this is what you do
When you run your fingers through my hair
In the morning, I'm feeling like a sexy superstar

Whoa, whoa, yeah
You rock my party, wanna make me say, "Ooh-ooh"
You're the only one that keeps me singing, "La la la"
I love to smell your t-shirt, I like the way you are
But most of all I like it, like it

I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good?
I like what you do to my hair
Tousle it, tease it, run your fingers through it
Oh, how you do
Now go and mess it up, mess it up
Baby, mess it up, mess it up, mess it up
Do it 'til I can't get enough, oh
I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good?

I'm un-perfect, so un-me, but I love the sugar
See, this is what you do, you get my ponytail to sag
My bangs are laughable
But I don't mind 'cause I think it's kinda super cool

Whoa, whoa
You rock my party, wanna make me say, "Ooh-ooh"
You're the only one that keeps me singing, "La la la"
I love to smell your t-shirt, I like the way you are
But most of all I like it, like it

I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good?
I like what you do to my hair
Tousle it, tease it, run your fingers through it
Oh, how you do
Now go and mess it up, mess it up
Baby, mess it up, mess it up, mess it up
Do it 'til I can't get enough, oh
I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good?

Tonight I'm gonna fix it up real nice, my Shirley Temple curls
I want you to mess 'em up
I'll put on a bow 'cause I want you to know
That you got your name on my heart
You're wicked bad and I like the way that you do it, baby
I like what you do to my hair
Who knew that looking a mess could feel so good?
I like what you do to my hair
Tousle it, tease it, run your fingers through it
Oh, how you do
Now go and mess it up, mess it up
Baby, mess it up, mess it up, mess it up
Do it 'til I can't get enough, oh
I like what you do to my hair
