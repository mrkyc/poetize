I've seen a lot of rip-offs in my life
Seen a lot of scams
A lot of crooks and crooked schemes, crooked sharks
Part one of the story reads...
The liquor store thief, the stick up man
Thrown into the clink
Never coming back, yeah
Until the day he's grey and old
Go!

I seen a lot of rip-offs in my life
The rip-offs of the old and of the young
The weak, the sick, the never known
Stabbed repeatedly in the back by the Wall Street suit
The Washington hack
Lining up their pockets with the people's cash and
Laughing all the way to the bank

Do you want to live your life a slave?
In chains from the cradle to the grave
The economy is suffering, let it die
Do you want to live your life a slave?
In chains from the cradle to the grave
The economy is suffering, let it die
Yeah

I've seen a lot of bailouts in my life
But why is it I never see a bailout for the homeless and the poor?
And while we're on the subject
I could use a few bucks for a guitar amp
A new six string, and a tank of gas, yeah
Everything that I want, that I want!

We're so fucked and we don't give a fuck, no
We're so fucked, but no, we just don't care
'Cause we're so, so fucked
This world is shit out of luck and we don't give a fuck

Do you want to live your life a slave?
In chains from the cradle to the grave
The economy is suffering, let it die
Do you want to live your life a slave?
In chains from the cradle to the grave
The economy is suffering, suffering, let it die

When the cities burn down we'll all be warm
When the cities burn down we'll all keep warm
When the cities burn down we'll all be warm
When the cities burn down we'll all be warm
When the cities burn down we'll all keep warm
When the cities burn down we'll all be warm
When the cities burn down we'll all be warm
When the cities burn down we'll all keep warm
When the cities burn down we'll all be warm, oh
