In the end they found their arms in shackles
And their hearts torn out
This country named America is built on graves
Of the natives who lived here before, genocide took place
The word "America" means "freedom" - as in, "free to kill the free..."
Don't fly those stripes, those stars and stripes for me, for me
Don't fly those stripes, those stars and stripes for me, for me... For me!
It's the same today as then, as U.S. tax dollars are spent
To rid the native insurgence in Mexico, and any other U.S. corporate interests
The third world is a modern day playground, for multinational companies
And the tax dollars we're forced to pay, fund these heartless U.S. policies
Their explanation... "it's national interest, national security..."
Don't fly those stripes, those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
Don't fly those stripes, those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
They stand for greed, they stand for hate, for nothing I believe
Don't fly those stripes, those stars-and-stripes for me, for me
At Little Bighorn national cemetery, there's a monument that reads: "to the soldiers killed in Montana while clearing
Hostile Indians away... '
And there's a flag there flying high, over the fallen killers' graves
When they call on me to die for them I'll say... "not me!"
