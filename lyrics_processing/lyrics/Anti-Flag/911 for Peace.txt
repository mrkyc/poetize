I see it in the headlines and I feel so sick, yeah
As another life leaves this world (this world) so full of hate
But short
Short on compassion
Short on humanity
Asking myself in vain, shaken by the shock
"do we even have a chance?"
I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human
Let's start to prove it
This is a plea for peace (world peace)
To the oppressors of the world and to
To the leaders of nations, corporate profit takers
To the everday citizen
Greed, envy, fear, hate-- the competition has to stop
When you see someone down, now's the time to pick them up
Set our differences aside (never look back, no)
You might also likeI don't wanna die

Isn't everybody tired of the fighting? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired of the killing? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired of the dying? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired for the hatred? (hey, hey)
Violence...(hey, hey)
Fighting... (hey)
Killing...(hey)
Dying... (hey)
Aaaaaaaah!!
So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow
I still have a dream
We will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children
Black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join
Hands and sing
"Free at last, free at last
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last. "
I don't wanna die
