If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning

Look outside your window, there's a woman being grabbed
They've voted with their reverence and a bible in their hand
Maybe we should go outside and try to stop her pain
But the anthem's started playing and I'd hate to miss the game
Sweating in the ghetto with the panthers and the poor
The rich will do it all for you but help you off the floor
Wouldn't their hope become a riot if the dream wasn't a rot
They've got their welfare pennies and besides we've got the cops

If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning

Now there's a dirty paper using sex to make a sale
They're all surprised the turnout and the outcomes were a fail
Maybe we can help their pain and speak the truth online
But we're busy reading Playboy and the Sunday New York Times

If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
Well you're safe now in the fire light
No we don't need another warning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning

I'll see you when the wall falls

If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
Well you're safe now in the fire light
No we don't need another warning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
