Pulled over by racist boys in blue in Brentwood, PA
There not a reason, they don't have any right
It's just that in their eyes he's not the correct shade of white
Driving in a neighborhood that's reigned by whites
Ain't healthy for a black man trying to live a lengthy life
All those cops they walked off free, but him he's in a grave
His name is Jonny Gammage, one of thousands they have slain
We've got no rights
When cops can kill
It's not right
We live in fear
Patrol man cruising in his car at night
Just looking for some homies he can rough up in a fight
Pulled over three kids in a total rage
Next thing that you know there's bodies all over the place
His backup came and they're all acting tough
Three kids versus six or seven cops, all armed with billy clubs
Those cops they did it just 'cause those kids' color and their age
They say that's not the truth, but this happens every fuckin' day
We've got no rights
When cops can kill
It's not right
We live in fear!
You might also likeFear of what you're gonna do
When a cop's talking shit to you
Fear of what you're gonna say
When the cops come gunning your way
Fear of what you shouldn't do
When the cops try to provoke you
Fear that on any given day
The cops could take your life away
They say "We're here to keep the peace"
What a bunch of fuckin' shit!
We've got no rights
When cops can kill

We've got no rights (We've got no rights)
It's not right (No, it's not right)
We've got no rights (We've got no rights)
It's not right
