I was ripped wide open like I never been before
Give me, give me, give me, give me chemicals
Kept me coming back, yeah, kept me coming back for more
Give me, give me, give me, give me chemicals
Where do you go when they don't love you anymore?
Do you need another reason to feel insecure?
There's a beautiful beach under the paved concrete
Give me, give me, give me, give me chemicals
We've fallen so far, I think I'm finally free
Give me, give me, give me, give me chemicals
Where do you go when they don't know you anymore?
Do you need another reason you're a prisoner?

I'll never trust you, you're just a liar
Closing the border of the fallen empire
I never thought that it would end like this
A finger on the button and a trigger to the kids
I'll never trust you, you're just a liar
Closing the border of the fallen empire
I never thought that it would end like this
Closing the border of the fallen empire

We only see the prices in the spectacle
Give me, give me, give me, give me chemicals
Only the young make love, only the old look bored
Give me, give me, give me, give me chemicals
Where do you go when they don't love you anymore?
Do you need another reason to feel insecure?

I'll never trust you, you're just a liar
Closing the border of the fallen empire
I never thought that it would end like this
A finger on the button and a trigger to the kids
I'll never trust you, you're just a liar
Closing the border of the fallen empire
I never thought that it would end like this
Closing the border of the fallen empire

You're just a liar, a liar, a liar
