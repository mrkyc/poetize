Then you have to start with yourself
So if George Bush wants to end terrorism
He should go ahead and kill himself!
I will not sign my blind faith away
To an unjustly leader of the unjust police state
Corporate masters live in their cess pool
Of extreme wealth and excess
Whoa Oh 
The phrase world leaders
Does not describe the heads of state
Those few in power
Work only for the corporate sake
No action, no interest, no humanity at all
As the corporate towers rise up
They watch the people fall
A government untouchable by the people
Run by the corporations of the world
Enslaving mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters
Profits put before people
Equal force, Equal reaction
Equal suppression, Equal rebellion

We've got to make a change
No religions, sexual preference
And regardless of your race
We've got to make a change
No war, corporate run
Governments, no police state
We've got to make a change
For the good of the human race
We've got to make a change
For the good of the human...
If your mother fuckers don't go cray right now
The fist of fury that is pat thetic you will have to deal with

No borders, no nations
No flags, no patriots
Woah oh, are your ready?, woah oh, let's go!
No borders, no nations
No flags, no patriots
