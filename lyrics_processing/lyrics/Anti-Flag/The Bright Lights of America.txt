In a hollow carved out place
Just looking for some prettiness
But the cuts in her arm don't paint for her
A very pretty view
In her mind..
She dreams that she is..
Far away...from..
The bright lights of America, life and death in a sold out 'Erica
To live and die in the heart of America, where they sell souls
The bright lights of America, life and death in a sold out 'Erica
To live and die in the heart of America, where they sell souls
A concrete city Hell (city Hell)
Suburbs that never end (just like the ocean)
One parent lives in each of them
Passed back and forth the tough route to escape both bitter homes
He's just one...
Of desperate ranks..
Who can't break free...from..
The bright lights of America, life and death in a sold out 'Erica
To live and die in the heart of America, where they sell souls
The bright lights of America, life and death in a sold out 'Erica
To live and die in the heart of America, where they sell souls
You might also likeI just want you to know
That there are whole houses full
Of fucked up kids like you and me (can't find a way)
So many lost in stride, caught in an endless fight
To leave this empty ugly place, I'm leaving you at sea!
