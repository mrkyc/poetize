I did my best to make it in the world
I plowed by sweat in tears into the fertile
Generation, generation, generated what was needed
For supply to meet demand
The sun shone bright on the ancient range
Then the promise of the future turned the Neo-Liberal Plain
The people's voice shut up, shut down, abstain
Is it gonna take a martyr to end the charade?
They tell you that you're out of luck
While people fall they watch their profits rocket up
S.O.S., this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Take back your rights from the IMF, World Bank and Monsanto
S.O.S., this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Corporatocracy leads to profits for killers
Profits for killers, no!
You might also likeGeneva to Washington, Cancun to Seoul
The Corporate Welfare State running out of control
The Corprocrats have got the guns, but their numbers are few
They can kill democracy, but they cannot kill the truth
(So!) Step out on the matrix of the corporate slave
(So!) Step into the world of the living wage
Not for one, not for two, not for three or four
But for every single citizen around the fucking world
The people in the fight of our lives
The spark of revolution in a farmers' suicide
S.O.S., this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Take back your rights from the IMF, World Bank and Monsanto
S.O.S., this is a global call
You better make a stand
You better make it now
Corporatocracy leads to profits for killers
Just a bunch of killers!
Profits for killers
When they wage war on you, you lay asleep
When they poison your food, you choose to drink
There's poison in the well!
Yeah!
