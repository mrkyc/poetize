Everybody just wants to fucking breathe
Nobody can, and everyone believes
We will just breathe later and they won't die
But truthfully they were never alive
To question the society you live in
You gotta call yourself in question
To question the answers you're given
You gotta call yourself in question
Chorus:
Because a cop lives inside of all our heads
We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started
A boss lives inside of all our heads
We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started
Verse 2:
We don't need a world where a guarantee
A starvation death, impossibility
In every home a new car, a new TV
Bringing the risk of dying of boredom
To question the society you live in
You gotta call yourself in question
To question the answers you're given
You gotta call yourself in question

Outro:
