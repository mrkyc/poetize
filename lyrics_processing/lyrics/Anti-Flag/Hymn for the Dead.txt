Because in death as in life
We are one in the same
Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors, go!
The sun sets, the light fades
The blood red on an empty street
It's not night, it's not day
It's no more, for an unfortunate soul who
Witnessed his life violently erased
From the horror of the human race
Bright futures exchanged for profit, living half alive
Sing a hymn for the dead
Because in death as in life
We are one in the same
Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors, go!
In life now pay respects to your blood
Those in the vast of the great unknown
Unite there, your heart's one
In moments you'll never forget, yeah
History lessons direct from the grave
Lost souls of the lost divide
Liberate your generation, living, rotting flesh

We are one in the same
Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors
Call out tyranny!
A spark of dissent can light a fury of flame
Call out to be free!
Sound off! Be the voice of a generation
Dissent! You've got a choice to make
Sound off! Be the voice of a generation
Dissent! You've got a choice to make
Strip away! Be the voice of a generation
Strip away! You've got a choice to make
Cut away! Cut away!
Strip away! Strip away!
Cut away! Strip away your chains!
