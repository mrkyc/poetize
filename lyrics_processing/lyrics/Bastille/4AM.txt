Four in the morning, we find ourselves here
The best of us passed out, I don't know who's where
I got all my old friends and new friends I've met once before
In a blanket of smoke as we sink through the floor

Here, here, my family
You are my familiar, you are my familiar
Here, here, my friends and me
You are my familiar

Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
No, there is nowhere I would rather be, oh-oh
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

Ooh
Ooh, ah

Time skips, balloon hits, I'm losing my mind
Tuesday'll be a doom day, this got out of hand
You might also like
Here, here, my family
You are my familiar, you are my familiar
Here, here, my friends and me
You are my familiar

Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
No, there is nowhere I would rather be, oh-oh
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

Ooh
Ooh, ah

I don't care if we're talkin' 'bout the same things
I don't care if we're stuck in the familiar
I don't care if we're goin' 'round in circles
Again, again, again

Here, here, my family (I might be a walking disaster)
You are my familiar, you are my familiar (Not much more that I would ask for)
Here, here, my friends and me (I might be a walking disaster)
You are my familiar (Not much more that I would ask for)
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
I never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, I can't remember
