When the event happens, there is little time to think of those things that people would like to have remain private
Getting caught up in the circus-like atmosphere, feeling less responsible to conventional ethical practices

Never good, just the bad and the ugly laid in front of you
Nothing quite like seeing the world through the TV's window
Feeling helpless, I look for distraction, I go searching for you
Wandering through our city to find some solace at your door

I can't stop thinking about it, I can't stop thinking about it
Tell me, did you see the news tonight?

Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get

Now draw me close

So come on, let's forget the emotion, tie the blinkers on
Hold both hands right over my eyes, deafen me with music
Till we're lost in the heat of the moment, and I'm moving in you
Help me keep these hours alive, help me chase those seconds
You might also like
I just keep talking about it, but I'll do nothing about it
Tell me, did you see the news last night?

Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold you can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get

Now draw me close

Hold me in this wild, wild world


Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
