(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh)
In my left hand, there is the familiar
In my right hand, there's the great unknown
I can see the madly different grass there
But I'm drawn to wilder nights at home

Don't listen to your friends, see the despair behind their eyes
Don't listen to your friends, they only care and want to know why

I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

Are you drifting way beyond what's normal?
'Cause 'round your mind rings the words that they would say (Say, say)
When you go home everything looks different
And you're scared of being left behind

Just listen to your friends, trust that they're fair, look in their eyes
Just listen to your friends, they only care and hope you're alright

Back, back, back, back, back
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh

I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
