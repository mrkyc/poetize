Everyone raps but say they don't battle rap
Any likkle funny chat, Chippy ain't having that
Yo where the money at? I be in my money bag
I just looked at my wrist, I got time today, yeah
Man get the pepper, sky that dweller
Me, I'm a real good feller
Just minding my business, stop that I'll stopped this
Fuck all the watches, watch this (Timeless)

Air Max or a Air Force one?
Serve and racket, Wimbledon
Rappers get up and pretend they're into tennis, coconut sober up
Contradictions, stop the cap
You don't battle rap, why drop and call it "Clash"?
I don't care what watch been bust
I was clashing when they were on
Daytonas, Yaughties, Subs
I had them all but what's that mean?
Man got a watch for every day of the week but they're still watchin' me
About clash, you won't survive
Sneaky features, come outside
Can't lie I can't teach you about drillings
But - I'll teach you about Grime
Having none, not from one
Anyone, everyone
Let him indirect on your song
Hole-in-two, all from (One)
Bitches
Bet they sleep in thongs
You know savage? Fenty ones
See Chip when I come through savage
Bitch, it's more like 21 (Twenty one)
At speed, three, two, one
Then repeat, then repeat
Guess that means, more than one
More than two? More than fun
2018 they wanna increase stop-and-search cah black kids dying ain't fun (Oooh)
Now it's zombies and ride-outs
Guess it's 2021
Plus, I live in his head rent-free
So miss me with the bailiff ones
Dum dum, knocking at your forehead from the inside, it's me!
You can hold this, son
Put these spitters all in check
All you'll hear is, disrespect
Indirects, what, for me?
Don't insult my intellect
Intercept, interject, into grime, into sets
Into dubs, into sends
They use grime, then neglect
I've been ready, I've been heavy, I've been steady
I love Headie
About shelling? I've been shelly
Since back when Tinchy, was with Benny
About hits? This is a hit
I had hits, when you were kids
I've had hits, since you're big
Hangman, bumba lyrical lynch
Why you rapping about zombie knives?
Stop the lies
Bare cap man are living nice
Zombie guys, kill spitters when I zombie slide
