I take shots at emcees when I want, like what?
Going back to back
You think you're me and Big Mike but you're not
Terminating emcees, I do my job
Now why you racing the beat fam?
Slow down, you sound lost (Ha ha ha ha ha ha)
These niggas punchline away and keep missing
I prefer the direct ting, not sneak dissing
(Bluku bye bye bye bye bye)
Cause when I pen pen pen man down, trust man go missing
Sound nicer than me on this sound? Keep wishing (Yeah)
Anyhow, anywho
You're a likkle man if you ain't top two in your crew

I can't believe you think you're the best (Huh?)
When I'm in the room, can't say it with your chest (Never)
Let's go rap, grime, acapella (You liar)
You know I'll leave with your head (Dead)
And I don't care what watch you got, ay, trust me, it's not that time
And if it is, then drop your first album, see if sells like mine
Go on then, go on then, go on then darg
Swear you just got signed (That won't save you)
Next time you write bars, better take Chipmunk off your mind (Write-off)

Wait, think about it, man (Yeah)

If you're the best, I'm your worst
And think before you splurge
Before you get work on work on work on work on work (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
I am packing words
When I rack it, swing it, words (Yeah)
But this ain't tennis, ain't no love in this game
But if you wanna swing, get served (Mad)
Good on my own, have your woes like whoa
If you take this grime ting for joke
You're bantz to me, not challenging no
The people are banging it though (You're one take)
Chippy, I believe you believe you can mention me like I haven't opened doors (Mad)
