Team UK, we on a mad ting (Ah!)
American girls, they love my accent (Represent)
Roadman, rate me, affiliated with money
Yardie girls love me, affiliated with Gully (Vado)
Hot topic, I'm the one they wanna talk on
The thin line between love and hate is what I walk on (Uh)
And any song I ever dropped was a right move (Yeah)
From the underground, but came from the right too (Ah!)
You tryna blow your way over air (Over air)
I'm puttin' power moves for the year (Haha)

Uh, this gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote
Off the records, no cameras, forget a quote
Some of my family doin' good, most doin' dope
I'm from Virginia where they hang them niggas by a rope
I used to see my momma gettin' beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can't even see down
Award shows, I pour my heart out
And people still steady tryna point my flaws out
And I'd be lyin' if I say it ain't get to me
But I'm a champion, legend, history

I'm always pushin' myself to the limit, makin' sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

Cole World, young Simba, story of my life
How to shine, put glory over ice
Rules made to be broken like a Oreo in life
Unabomber, they thought I blew up overnight, boom
UPS, plus it down, huh
While you BS'd and fucked around
I took a dollar to the city of the dreams
Called up my homies and then I put them on my team
And so we paid, and now we out in London, oh, behave
Cold World if you wonderin', snowy days
I made it through with no heaters, fuck the leaders
When we starvin', they won't feed us, we don't need 'em

I'm always pushin' myself to the limit, makin' sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

Some people have to learn (Aha, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah)

But I was born a champion, woah-oh
Champion (Yeah, yeah)
