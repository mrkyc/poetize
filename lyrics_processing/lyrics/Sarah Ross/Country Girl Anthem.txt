If you're lookin' for a girl you've never seen before
Baby, take a look at me
I can be on top in my four-wheel drive
And my cut off blue jeans

I can be a lady
Or I can be crazy
I was born in the sunshine but it was the moonlight
That raised me

'Cause there ain't no girl like a country girl
Come on if you're feelin' me
Throw your hands in the air, let down your hair
Clap your hands and stomp your feet

We're one of a kind
Gonna blow your mind
Let me hear it for the girls, you know who you are
If you're country like me

You can keep your high heels, I got my boots on
I can out-shoot all the boys
Me and the backroads, dirt flyin', dust blowin'
Music makin' lots of noise
You might also like
It's a party in the holler
There's a fire in the sky
All my girls around and we're gonna throw down
Have us one hell of a night

Now Dixie cup tilted up in the backwoods
Just 'cause I'm a girly-girl don't mean that I can't shoot good
If you wanna get down with us bring your friends
Pile 'em in the truck and head down to where the blacktop ends
So come and get it if you want it, hop in I'm gonna show ya
How we get down from sunup 'til in the mornin'
Ridin' them backroads as the moonlight glows
Throwin' them back, yo can city folks hang? No

'Cause there ain't no girl like a country girl
Come on if you're feelin' me
Throw your hands in the air, let down your hair
Clap your hands and stomp your feet

We're one of a kind
Gonna blow your mind
Let me hear it for the girls, you know who you are
If you're country like me
You can take me home to mama
Go huntin' with your dad
I'm tough and sweet, everything you ever dreamed
And better than anything you had

'Cause there ain't no girl like a country girl
Come on if you're feelin' me
Throw your hands in the air, let down your hair
Clap your hands and stomp your feet

We're one of a kind
Gonna blow your mind
Let me hear it for the girls, you know who you are
