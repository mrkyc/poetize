Love and miss

It's getting eerie quiet
Won't stay like this for long
Even the crows start flying
They know, they know what's going on
You could tell by the red sky
There's something brewing
You had your chance to run and hide
I guess, I guess you blew it

The clouds are turning gray
Better pray for your saving grace
It's just a little too late

I hope when the lightning strikes
It hits your right between the eyes
And when the rain pours down, better hold your breath
Cause you don't know what's coming next
When the thunder screams across the sky
Gonna hear my name in all your lies
Look out boy, you'd better be warned
This is the calm before the storm
You might also like
You had my heart, you took it and ripped it apart
Now that it's so dark, you can't even wish on a star
I hope to God you're praying too and it's enough to do his part
Unless a tornado blow through your trailer park
Pardon me if I sound a little too harsh
But your love was my ocean, now you're stuck in the marsh
On his front porch watching the sun fade
Into the pitch black of yesterday

The clouds are turning gray
Better pray for your saving grace
It's just a little too late

I hope when the lightning strikes
It hits your right between the eyes
And when the rain pours down, better hold your breath
Cause you don't know what's coming next
When the thunder screams across the sky
Gonna hear my name in all your lies
Look out boy, you'd better be warned
This is the calm before the storm

The sun's gonna shine, the storm will subside
And I don't care if you made it out alive
The heart that you hurt will be a lesson you learn
You'll finally get what you deserve
I hope when the lightning strikes
It hits your right between the eyes
When the rain pours down, better hold your breath
Cause you don't know what's coming next
When the thunder screams across the sky
Gonna hear my name in all your lies
Look out boy, you'd better be warned
