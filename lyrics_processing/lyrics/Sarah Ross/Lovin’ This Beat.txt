Like being on a carnival ride
Never knowing if it's gonna break down
Like going out on a Friday night
Blowing smoke with the party crowd
Like sneaking out the back door, pedal to the floorboard
But nothing can compare to the way you've got me feeling
It's so much more

I can feel it, bumping like an 8-oh-8
'Cause it's just like adrenaline running through my veins
It's kinda crazy how you always got me singing like
Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o, ey...
Digging the groove and the way that you move
It's making me dance a little differently
Can't you see that you got my heart?
I'm lovin' this beat
Like ey-o, ey-o, ey, lovin' this beat
Like ey-o, ey-o, ey...

It's like running for a touchdown, crowd's loud
Time running out on the clock
Like I'm in the middle of a dance floor
All eyes on me, never wanna stop
You might also like
I can feel it, bumping like an 8-oh-8
'Cause it's just like adrenaline running through my veins
It's kinda crazy how you always got me singing like
Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o, ey...
Digging the groove and the way that you move
It's making me dance a little differently
Can't you see that you got my heart?
I'm lovin' this beat
Like ey-o, ey-o, ey, lovin' this beat
Like ey-o, ey-o, ey...

D-D-Dear, do you feel it now baby?
'Cause if you wanna go and get to it, I'm ready
C-C-Can I, can I show you that I'm crushing heavy
Got no chains to hold us back, been aiming for you, shooting steady, yeah
I can feel it, your kiss is just like adrenaline

I can feel it, pumping like an 8-oh-8
'Cause it's just like adrenaline running through my veins
It's kinda crazy how you always got me singing like
Ey-o, ey-o, ey-o, ey...
Digging the groove and the way that you move
It's making me dance a little differently
Can't you see that you got my heart?
Lovin' this beat
Digging the groove and the way that you move
And everything you're doing to me has got me loving this beat
Like ey-o, ey-o, ey, lovin' this beat
