If you've ever seen a girl like me, it ain't hard to tell
We know how to skin a deer and raise a little hell
We're dressed to kill and we still will slang a little lead
City girls knock 'em down, but country girls knock 'em dead

It's the backroad beauty queen
With a pink camo twenty-two shootin' everything
Country ain't a state of mind, it's the way of life
Kill it, clean it, cook it, put it in the deep fry
Well I'm a dirt road renegade
Raisin' cane and it ain't the same
I'd rather walk barefooted in the muddy clay
Than walk two steps on a road that's paved
I got a shotgun ridin' shotgun all day
Take a minute, take a picture, I ain't goin' away
I hunt and fish in the sticks almost every day
When I ain't, I'm tellin' y'all all about it up on the stage
Us country girls, ain't nothin' we can't do
Go to the bar, and we'll drink you under the booth
That's the truth
And if you give us any lip, we'll stomp your ass in these cowgirl boots

If you've ever seen a girl like me, it ain't hard to tell
We know how to skin a deer and raise a little hell
We're dressed to kill and we still will slang a little lead
City girls knock 'em down, but country girls knock 'em dead
You might also like
Catch me in the Ford, in a field
With the doors open, soakin' up the sunset, say it
Fill up my cup a couple of times until I'm red
Dedicated to a provin' that country girls are the best
I can work, haul hay, shoot a scope all day
Park a boat in the cove and then get sideways
Papa's still got a still, still poppin' on the hill
For a hundred dollar bill you can feel that way
It's an amazing life, my ride's ridin' high, Bible by my side
As I slide on into the mud on them big buckshot thirty-fives
Yeah I... I bleed red, white, and blue, I'm American to the fullest, so
So go and break in my home and you're gonna catch a bullet

If you've ever seen a girl like me, it ain't hard to tell
We know how to skin a deer and raise a little hell
We're dressed to kill and we still will slang a little lead
City girls knock 'em down, but country girls knock 'em dead

It's sweat and blood
Wakin' up in the mornin' 'fore the sun does
It's sweet tea, cornbread
It's camoflauge, on up to get the cows fed
Backwoods baby, beautiful, ain't it
Hotter than a shot of lead
Daddo just popped off, this ain't just talk, no
Country girls knock 'em dead
Oh, they knock 'em dead (knock 'em dead, knock 'em dead)
Us country girls knock 'em dead (knock 'em dead, knock 'em dead)
We knock 'em dead
