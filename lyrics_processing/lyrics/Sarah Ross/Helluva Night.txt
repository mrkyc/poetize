Got all my girls with me and we're lookin' for a good time
We're throwin' on our tightest blue jeans and we're dressed to the nine
Don't know where the night will end we can sleep when we're dead
'Till then we just unwind
Straight through the back door we don't even wait in line naw

Turn the party on up skip the slow songs
This kinda music makes you feel alright
Crank it up everybody just sing along
Let's have a helluva have helluva night
Oh oh
Helluva night
Oh oh
Helluva night

It's about to go down in this one horse town
Me and my girls all up in this thing now
We ain't makin' no fuss we just tryin' do us
Get the party turned up when we came out
I'm a country girl raised on some down home ways
But I get on that flow and I go low
Shake a little over here shake a little over there
You can look but touchin' me is a no no
My favorite song came on, and yes I made it known
This is how we roll yeah I'm in the zone
One helluva night I ain't goin' home
You might also like
Turn the party on up skip the slow songs
This kinda music makes you feel alright
Crank it up everybody just sing along
Let's have a helluva have helluva night
Oh oh
Helluva night
Oh oh
Helluva night

You wanna keep rockin' until the mornin' sun comes up
Look at us still goin' strong
And we're the last ones here and we gon' disappear
If you spin us one more song
If the music's real loud and you bump the bass
I don't really care what song you play hey
Hey hey mister DJ hey

Turn the party on up skip the slow songs
This kinda music makes you feel alright
Crank it up everybody just sing along
Let's have a helluva have helluva night
Oh oh
Helluva night
Oh oh
Helluva night
Oh oh
Helluva night
Oh oh
