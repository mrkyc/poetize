I've been working hard all week
And I sure could use a break
Ten more minutes in my shift
Then I'm calling it a day
There's a local band that's playing
At my favorite little spot
Almost all my friends are going
But as for me, at 5:00
I'll drive for fifteen minutes
Like I'm headed out of town
The way we did last spring break weekend
Then I'll turn this truck around
I'll take the long way past that old steel bridge
Where you stole my heart with that first kiss
20 minutes later, I pull in the drive
Where I listen to our song three more times

For 60 minutes you're back here by my side
That's my happy hour

There's some things you don't get over
Memories you won't get past
If you try to set them free
You can bet they'll be back
I guess that's why when I can't sleep
'Cause you're all that's on my mind
Baby, I just grab my keys
In the middle of the night
You might also like
I'll drive for fifteen minutes
Like I'm headed out of town
The way we did last spring break weekend
Then I'll turn this truck around
I'll take the long way past that old steel bridge
Where you stole my heart with that first kiss
20 minutes later, I pull in the drive
Where I listen to our song three more times

For 60 minutes you're back here by my side
That's my happy hour

The only explanation for missing you this much
Is I'm either going crazy, or I'm just still in love

I'll drive for fifteen minutes
Like I'm headed out of town
The way we did last spring break weekend
Then I'll turn this truck around
I'll take the long way past that old steel bridge
Where you stole my heart with that first kiss
20 minutes later, I pull in the drive
Where I listen to our song three more times
For 60 minutes you're back here by my side
That's my happy hour
