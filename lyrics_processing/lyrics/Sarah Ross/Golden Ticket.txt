Everybody wants somebody to use
I want you to want me to be the one that you don't want me to want me to be
If you don't want me to want me to be the things that I can see I can be

I thought a little somethin'
Did a little wanderin' doin' what I want to do
I got a little somethin' pulled it out of nothin' got it from you
I didn't wanna hear it, if you wanna judge me, goin' back to my roots
I don't wanna waste my time 'cause I know what I gotta do, mm

I want you to want me to be the one that you don't want me to want me to be
If you don't want me to want me to be the things that I can see I can be
Everybody wants somebody (Somebody to use, somebody to use)
Everybody wants somebody to use

Just trying to get back like lyrically whatever the fuck we're going to

Just trying to get back like lyrically
Got a song on my side that I didn't wanna sing
And if you're offended then I got a friend it
Patron and killing time now lift me like Hagrid
I got a golden ticket and I left it behind me in Hollywood
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I'm not

Everybody wants somebody to use

I'm sorry but I'm not
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Why'd you have to go and do that again?
Why'd you have to go and do that again?
Why'd you have to go and do that again?
Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to) and do that again?

Everybody wants somebody (If you don't want me to want me to be the things that I can see I can be)
Everybody wants somebody to use

I want you to see
What you want, what you wantin' to be
Why can't you see I'll be the one that I've been wantin' to be 'cause I want to
Yeah I want to
Yeah I want to
And I want you to see what I see
