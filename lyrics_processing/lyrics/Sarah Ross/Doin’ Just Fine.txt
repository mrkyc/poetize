Always talkin' about all the time and money you spent on me
Sayin' you could get someone much better than me
Treatin' me like some kind of rent, now you're done with it yeah
You were on the way out and I was on the way in
Didn't think that we could be just friends
So you went and tore my heart off track
And now you want me back

But I'm doin' just fine hey
Ever since you walked away
Won't let my heart break
No you can't bring me down
To me, you're gonna be my last mistake
You're never gonna want to replay
It don't matter what you say
I'm doin' just fine
I'm doin' just fine

I heard you runnin' around with your friends downtown
And that girl that you told me you knew nothin' about
But I'm the one you must be missin' when you get drunk
Now you're callin' me up
You might also like
But I'm doin' just fine hey
Ever since you walked away
Won't let my heart break
No you can't bring me down
To me, you're gonna be my last mistake
You're never gonna want to replay
It don't matter what you say
I'm doin' just fine
I'm doin' just fine

I heard you runnin' around with your friends downtown
And that girl that you told me you knew nothin' about
But I'm the one you must be missin' when you get drunk
Now you're callin' me up

But I'm doin' just fine hey
Ever since you walked away
Won't let my heart break
No you can't bring me down
To me, you're gonna be my last mistake
You're never gonna want to replay
It don't matter what you say
I'm doin' just fine
Yeah I'm doin' just fine
Yeah I'm doin' just fine
