You walk along the emerald brooks
Where the fish are always biting
You don't even need a hook, nah-ah
Horses run across the amber
Ain't no fences way up there
Brush the stars on the midway
Of St. Peter's county fair
Whoa, an angel plays a southern hymn
On a silver mandolin
Shining in the delta sun
Prayers dance across the prairie
Nothing there is ordinary
You're always with the ones you love
On the country side of heaven
Whoa, oh, oh
On the country side of heaven
Whoa, oh, oh
Kids are jumping off the back porch
Into a cloud up in the sky
Water turns into sweet tea
On the bayou, by and by

On a silver mandolin
Shining in the delta sun
Prayers dance across the prairie
Nothing there is ordinary
You're always with the ones you love
On the country side of heaven
Whoa, oh, oh
On the country side of heaven
I wanna go
To the country side of heaven
Whoa, oh, oh
The country side of heaven
On the country side of heaven
Someday that's where I'll be
Singing harmony with Jesus
And when you get there look for me
On the country side of heaven (angels play a southern hymn)
Oh (on a silver mandolin)
The country side of heaven
Oh (shining in the delta sun)
To the country side of heaven (prayers dance across the prairie)
Oh (nothing there is ordinary)
The country side of heaven (you're always with the ones you love)
On the country side of heaven
Whoa, oh, oh
On the country side of heaven
I wanna go
To the country side of heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven
On the country side of heaven
On the country side of heaven
