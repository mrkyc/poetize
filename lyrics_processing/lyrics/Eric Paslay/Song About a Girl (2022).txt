This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped-up cars, water towers
Or drownin' in a bottle of Jack
This ain't about Chevys
Ain't about money
Ain't about blue suede shoes, coo-coo-ca-choos
Got nothin' to do with that

It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Yeah, little heartbreak queen, rockin' the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
Song about a girl
You can't forget
Yeah, blows your mind every time
Think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Yeah, it's a song about you, baby
Yeah, yeah

This ain't about hometowns
Ain't about back roads
Ain't about shoulda, coulda, wish I woulda
Rearviews lookin' back
This ain't about goodbyes
Ain't about comebacks
Oh, got nothin' to do with the stars and the moon
Man, you're gettin' way off track
You might also like
It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen, rockin' the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
Song about a girl
You can't forget
Yeah, blows your mind every time
Think it's gonna be a hit
Song about a girl

Yeah

Baby, you, yeah, you
Yeah, you know who you are
Baby, you, yeah, you
Now read my lips, hear my heart
Listen to this guitar

It's a song about a girl
Goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen, rockin' the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
Song about a girl
Every time
Yeah, don't think too hard, dig too deep
Or read between the lines
It's a song about a girl, yeah
It goes like this
Oh, little heartbreak queen, rockin' the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
Song about a girl
You can't forget
Yeah, blows your mind every time
Think it's gonna be a hit
Song about a girl, girl, woah
Song about a girl, girl, woah, yeah
Song about a girl, girl, woah
Song about a girl, oh-oh

This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped-up cars, water towers
