I never dreamed that I could fall
But something's come over me
Now I'm sittin' starin' at the wall
Afraid for my sanity, yeah

The sounds of your voice
The touch of your skin
It's hauntin' me (Hauntin' me)
I'm still tryin' to come to my senses
But I can't look back
So I'm takin' my chances

I wanna give you my heart
Give you my soul
I wanna lay in your arms
Never let go
Don't wanna live
My life without you
But I know when you're gone
Like a fire needs a spark
Like a fool in the dark, yeah
Honey, I'll cry for you
Cry for you
You might also like
Wonderin' why I'm runnin' scared
From what I believe in
I know that love is just another word
To say what I'm feelin'

For once in my life
The future is mine
It's callin' me (Callin' me)
I've been searchin' so long
For an answer
But it's too late now
So I'm takin' my chances

I wanna give you my heart
Give you my soul
I wanna lay in your arms
Never let go
Don't wanna live
My life without you
But I know when you're gone
Like a fire needs a spark
Like a fool in the dark, yeah
Honey, I'll cry for you

For once in my life
The future is mine
It's callin' me (Callin' me)
I've been searchin' so long
For an answer
But it's too late now
So I'm takin' my chances, yeah

I wanna give you my heart
Give you my soul
I wanna lay in your arms
Never let go
Don't wanna live
My life without you
But I know when you're gone
Oh, Honey, I'll cry for you

(I wanna give you my heart)
I'll cry for you
(I wanna lay in your arms)
Don't make me cry for you
(Oh, oh!)
