Show me the best that you got and I'll show you one better
Show me your reddest rose and I'll show you one redder
Tell me a dirty joke and I'll laugh it off lightly
If I tell you a dirty joke, you might not like me

Everyone gets to make one big mistake
And if you're waitin' on me, well, I guess you're gonna have to wait

Ti-time-timing is everything if you've got nothin' but time
(I got nothin' but time)
And a lie don't mean nothin' if nobody knows when you're lying
(Lie when you lie)
So lie when you do, lie when you don't
Lie when you didn't, lie till you lie, lie, lie, lie
They're wonderin' if anybody else is lying

Everyone gets to make one big mistake
And if you're waitin' on me, well, I guess you're gonna have to wait
'Cause I'm savin' mine up for a very, very special day
When I can fuck it all up in the most spectacular way

Everyone gets to make one big mistake
And if you're waitin' on me, well, I guess you're gonna have to wait
And wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait
You might also like
Everyone gets to make one big mistake
(Mistake, mistake, mistake, mistake, mistake, mistake, mistake, mistake)
And if you're waitin' on me, well, I guess you're gonna have to wait
(You're gonna have to wait)
'Cause I'm savin' mine up for a very, very special day
(It doesn't even matter if it don't even matter)
When I can fuck it all up in the most spectacular way

Show me the best that you got and I'll show you one better
Show me your reddest rose and I'll show you one redder
Tell me a dirty joke and I'll laugh it off lightly
