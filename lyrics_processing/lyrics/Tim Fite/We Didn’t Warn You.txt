You're gonna have cancer when your done
If you eat too much food
You're gonna gain weight you'll never lose
I seen it on the evenin' news!
When you watch TV too close
The radiation goes right up your nose
If you drive your car too fast
There's a 70% chance you're gonna crash
When the fruit is made of wax
It's hard to tell the fictions from the facts
If someone slaps you on the back
Your face is gonna stay like that
Don't say we didn't Warn You!
Don't say we didn't Warn You!
Don't say we didn't Warn You!
Don't say... we didn't Warn You!
Remember that time you
Hit your thumb with a hammer?
Remember that time you
Took them nudies with your camera;
(don't say we didn't warn you)

Or when you burned the roof of your mouth?
Don't say we didn't Warn You!
Don't say we didn't, Warn You!
Before you shot your eye out!
Before the corporate buy out!
I bet somebody warned you!
(don't say we didn't)
WARN YOU! Not to Lie!
And Not to Steal!
Not to Bank on dirty deals
Not to fake, Not to follow
Not to beg and NOT TO BARROW!
Don't say we didn't Warn You!

Your face is gonna stay like that
Don't say we didn't Warn You!
Don't say we didn't Warn You!

And someday when it's not so bad
We'll all look back and laugh
