For people who can't draw
Nothin' but stick figures
And they'll say
Could you scribble one without the guns
With a smile on the donkey
And no dicks on the nuns?
And I'll say "Yeah, that's not a problem
I'll do the job for a price that's rock bottom."
And when I'm finished they tell me it's great
A couple of months pass, "Hey Wait"
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
(x4)
Other times I get work makin' songs
For people who don't got
A single note in their lungs
They say, "Uh... What's that one you did?
Way back when. Uh, Big Mistake! Yeah
Do that again
Except leave out the cursin'
And make the chorus longer."
You might also likeAnd I say "No sweat
I'ma head over yonder
And do it up for ya reallllll nice."
High Quality Shit!
At a Low Quality Price! ;)
Yeahhhh, that beat right there is gettin' in
And ya hear that hook, it's goin' top 10"
They talk the same shit, again and again
Sayin' Ima get paid
And I'm like...
"When?!"
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
(I did my job!)
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
(but still I got robbed)
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
(My work is top rated!)
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
(but not compensated)
So the next time
I'm at the cash register
I'm not gonna pay!
And the next bill I get
From my creditor
I'm not gonna pay!
And the next time they ask
For a service fee
I'm not gonna pay!
From here on out
Everything is free...
Cuz I'm not gonna pay
And they'll say...
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me
Why you no pay me

This Jam goes out to anybody
Who's ever, ya know
Worked really really hard at somethin'
And, you know, not even made a single dime off of it
Ya know!?
Ya just do it cuz.... cuz
You think you're gonna get paid
And then they don't pay ya
Sometimes I get work drawin' pictures
Other times I get work makin' songs
Sometimes I get work drawin' pictures...
Drawin' pictures...
