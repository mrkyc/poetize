Rocks in the mud and they all gunked out, all gunked out, all gunked out
Trucks in the bunk and they all danged up, all danged up, all danged up
Guts in them trucks and them all sayin' fuck, all sayin' fuck, all sayin' fuck
("Good. I'm glad you're here. We're gonna have a wonderful week. And anything you want. Anything.")
I want you to buy my record so I can sell out in 60 seconds
At the Best Buy, I wanna be the best guy. You know that I'm better than the next guy
Even though we both sound exactly alike. Is that Jadakiss or is that Tim Fite?
I don't know but I'm still gonna buy it
Consumerism is the shit now try it
You know you wanna try it
C'mon and try it
Talks on the lug and they all bonked out, all bonked out, all bonked out
Rocks in the mud and they all gunked out, all gunked out, all gunked out
Trucks in the bunk and they all danged up, all danged up, all danged
Guts in them trucks and them all sayin' fuck, all sayin' fuck, all sayin' . . . fuck
Fuck

Fuck
Fuck. (Say it.)
Fuck. (Say it.)
