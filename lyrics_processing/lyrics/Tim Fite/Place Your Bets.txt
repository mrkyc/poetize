Cuz if I first the bad part
The third part won't feel worse
Immersed in inertia
A person could hurt ya
Cursed by the verse of a first person murder
Cadabra cadabra
A corpse, a cadabra
It's magic like average cadaver
Menagerie taggers
Toe-ticket closed black bag tongue waggers
All about cloakin' them daggers
One more dead, one more dead
Can I get a holla for one more head
One more head for one more hand
One more bet for one more man
Shuffle the cards, ruffle the feathers
Buck the odds and stay tougher than leather
Go getters, go getters, go get a gun
And for those who don't know
Better hoes better run
Run out and buy a fresh deck of cards
Stop fakin' butter and start fakin' lard

Can I get a holla for one more head
One more head for one more hand
One more bet for one more man
I tell the story again about the knife and the guts
Where the guts go 'god damn!' when the knife edge cuts
There'll be blood and such
To represent bad luck
Encrusting the plot
When events scab up
It's a raid (it's a raid)
Everybody against the wall (everybody)
Tonight the house won't win (no they won't)
Tonight the house won't win at all (it's a grave)
It's a grave, grave situation here
Someone spit on the artifice
Someone twisted the chandalier
Don't waste your gobos
Don't placate your crocus
Don't shade your robos
Don't take along your losses
Don't, don't, don't look down, don't
On the left, on the right
Amalakalaka, look right
Black coal x3
Don't ask if you don't know
Black coal x3
Ain't in your heart no more
Don't waste your gobos
Don't placate your crocus
Don't shade your robos
Don't take along your losses
The loss is the boss gets the gats and the gavel
Progress
It's cost minus loss divided by time traveled
Tell me true, can you ever win back the
Tell me true, can you ever win back the
Tell me true, can you ever win back the limb you lose
Or do you just lose your limbs
Again and again
Until your life lies limbless
There's limits to how much independence you can give an appendage
Before the end of the hand is definitive
That's why this tale is regenerative
One more dead, one more dead
Can I get a holla for one more head
One more head for one more hand
One more bet for one more man
