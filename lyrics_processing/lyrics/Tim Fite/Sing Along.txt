Three more times for the bah bah bah
We wanna, we wanna, we wanna lalala
Four more times for the yippity-yay
Three more times for the hey hey hey
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna lalala
Even if the notes don't play
Even if we don't have a say
Even if the words are all wrong
We're still gonna sing along
Does anybody know, does anybody know
Where I can go to get a hey and a ho?
We wanna, we wanna, we wanna lalala
Does anybody care, does anybody care
That all the shit smell the same around here?
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna lalala
Even if the notes don't play
Even if we don't have a say
Even if the words are all wrong
We're still gonna sing along
Inside the tv where everyone's nice
My favorite songs all offer advice
It's terribly thoughtful of you I say
It's terribly kind
No trouble
And all they say is the pleasure is mine

Even if we don't have a say
Even if the words are all wrong
We're still gonna sing along
One more time for the lah-dee-dah
Three more times for the bah bah bah
