Four broke legs
Three broke fingers
Two broke eggs
One broke bed jumper, can't do nothin' 'bout it
Bleedin' kinda bad but he'll have to paper-towel it
If it gets worse he'll wrap some duct tape around it
Maybe pour some whisky down it
If you can't beat the pain, drown it
This is how it soundin'
Five little monkeys jumpin' on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
Mama called the doctor, the doctor said
Sorry but you're not covred
Five broke elbows
Four broke teeth
Three broke kneecaps
Two broke feet
One broke bed jumper lyin' on the floor
Mama cryin' rivers cuz she's never been insured
Sure enough her baby's gonna suffer for it
Some say that the uninsured are tougher for it
But those motherfucker's got it all distorted
'cuz it's tough gettin' hurt when you can't afford it
