We are the last of the jukebox Romeos
We are romantics by the light of the four way
We came to sing out a chorus, reinvent the good times
And bring it all back home again

Honey, we came to dance with the girls with the stars in their eyes
Do the jump back, jack, stop and slide to the right
Never break their hearts, never make them cry, come on
Strike up the band, play a song that everybody knows
If I'm not your kind, then don't tell a soul
I'm not the one who hates bein' alone, so come on

And in this unstable arena of what's left or become of my America
I'm askin' this dance so come take my hand, come on
And in this unstable arena of what's left or become of my America
I'm askin' this dance so come take my hand, come on

Honey, we came to dance with the girls with the stars in their eyes
Do the jump back, jack, stop and slide to the right
Never break their hearts, never make them cry, come on
Strike up the band, play a song that everybody knows
If I'm not your kind, then don't tell a soul
I'm not the one who hates bein' alone, so come on
See The Gaslight Anthem LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like
And if they end it all by the end of tonight
If the big bomb drops down over this quiet Edison sky
We'll blow one last kiss to all the beautiful nights like this
Under this central Jersey sky

Honey, we came to dance with the girls with the stars in their eyes
Do the jump back, jack, stop and slide to the right
Never break their hearts, never make them cry, come on
Strike up the band, play a song that everybody knows
If I'm not your kind, then don't tell a soul
I'm not the one who hates bein' alone, so come on

'Cause you ain't never had a night on the town
Like I can show you such a night on the town
And you ain't never had a song you could sing
Well, it's a deep dark night, and I hear you, I've been there
And these are the songs that we sing
Oh, these are the songs that we sing
You've never seen a two-step
Like when you've seen it from your mama's house
Where the kids flash like lightning
To the very best dancers around
We learned from the very best dancers around
We learned from the very best dancers in town
Come take my hand
