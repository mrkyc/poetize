From the hands of the dark
From the things I didn't know
That would simply break your heart
There were years in this room
Lined and shattered in the glass
Held it up to myself til I just couldn't stand
So don't ask me where I've been
Cause you don't want to know
And don't ask me who I'm seeing
No, you don't want to know
And don't come around me here
When I need you the most
Leave it alone
Leave a little room for the holy ghost
And come take me out of the light
I don't feel you anymore
I came apart from myself
From the crosses you wore
And the things in my soul
Once my comfort and friend
I came to the reasons
And I lost you again

Leave it alone
Leave a little room for the holy ghost
