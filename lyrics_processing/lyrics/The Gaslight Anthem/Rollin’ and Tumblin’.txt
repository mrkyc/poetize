You'd better find some other body to comfort
When I was trembling, baby, you was a diamond
But you ain't a diamond no more
So what you want to say is my head is a hurricane
Well let me sleep on that, uh huh, all right
You say I'm hopelessly devoted to misery
Well I don't want to be so devoted no more

And all of my friends want to get into heaven
And all I keep thinking is I wish you were here
I heard that they've been calling me the Great Depression
Rollin' and tumblin', breaking my own heart again
Shimmy, shimmy, shake, baby right in my bloodstream
I don't know what it was that got in my room
My ticker-tape heart broke and everything shook in here
But I heard it could be worse
So what you want to say is my head is a weathervane
Spinning with the wind chime, right
Maybe I was born on the Fourth of July
Exploding like a firework

And all of my friends want to get into heaven
And all I keep thinking is I wish you were here
I heard that they've been calling me the Great Depression
Rollin' and tumblin'
And all of my friends want to get into heaven
And all I keep thinking is I wish you were here
I heard that they've been calling me the Great Depression
Rollin' and tumblin'
So should I take everything
All your temporary medicines?
Should I take your reds, your blues, and your cocaine?
Should I take something to try on the weekend?
Should I take anything?
Or did you mean everything?
When I hit the wall, wrecked from it all
You put flowers down on the cold ground
And cry me a river
And assure me I'm crazy
While you question the answers
And you lean on my best friends
Until you find better weather
And you take a vacation
I hope you got all my letters
Signed the Great Depression
