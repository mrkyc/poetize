I was crawling around in my head in the haze of a trance
'Til Rico said, "I'ma turn you onto a sound
Cool out your head
This is the sound from Camden town."

And then I heard it like a shot from my skull to my brain
I felt my fingertips tingle and it started to rain
When the walls of my bedroom were tremblin' around me
This ramshackle voice over attack of a blue beat
Tellin' me "He's only looking for fun"

And this was the sound of the very last gang in town
As heard by my wild young heart
Like directions on a cold dark night
Sayin' "Let it out, let it out, let it out, you're doin' all right."
And I heard it in his chain gang soul
How it wasn't just the same sad song
Sayin' "Let it out, let it out, let it out, you're doin' all right."

And I carried these songs like a comfort wherever I'd go
And they was there when my summers was high
And there when she left me alone
Saying, "the soul is hard to find"

And I never got to tell him so I just wrote it down
I wrapped a couple chords around it then I let it come out
When the walls of my bedroom trembled around me
This ramshackle voice over attack of a blue beat
And a girl, on the excitement gang

And this was the sound of the very last gang in town
As heard by my wild young heart
Like directions on a cold dark night
Sayin', "Let it out, let it out, let it out, you're doin' all right."
And I heard it in his chain gang soul
How it wasn't just the same sad song
Sayin', "Let it out, let it out, let it out, you're doin' all right."

That was the sound
I hear the sound
Do you hear the sound?
I hear the sound
