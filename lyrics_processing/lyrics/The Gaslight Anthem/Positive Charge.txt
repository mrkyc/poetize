"Where did you go?" I would say that to myself often
Like I was dressing up for a coffin to lie down in
I can't say I know, I was overcome in the distance
I was lost in my own incidents in my mind
Were you calling me from outside of a dream?

I wanna live, I wanna love you a little longer
I was invincible many years ago when I was so much stronger
I wanna smile like a letter from an old friend
My arms are wide as oceans
How I've missed you, and feelin' good to be alive

Wherever I'd go, there were whispers in the vestibules
Reminders of my time with you on my own
It's hard to know when your mind declares a war on you
Like the thoughts inside my skull would do, like I was blind
And I'm sure I saw the signs but didn't know

I wanna live, I wanna love you a little longer
I was invincible many years ago when I was so much stronger
I wanna smile like a letter from an old friend
My arms are open oceans
How I've missed you, and feelin' good to be alive

I need a spark, I need a positive charge
Plug it into my brain and make me love my life again

I wanna live, I wanna love you a little longer
I was invincible many years ago when I was so much stronger
I wanna smile like a letter from an old friend
My arms are open oceans
How I've missed you, and feelin' good to be alive

(How I've missed you, how I've missed you)
Feelin' good to be alive
(How I've missed you, how I've missed you)
And it's good to be alive
(How I've missed you, how I've missed you)
Oh-oh, oh
(How I've missed you, how I've missed you)
