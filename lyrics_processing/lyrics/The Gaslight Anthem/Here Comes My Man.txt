And how much time do you think that we have?
If I wanted to, I could start over again
Let the good night decide who she wants me to find
And I'll never let you drop another tear in my eye

Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey, here comes my man
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey, here comes my man

And all my life, I never had a chance
Don't you think I knew about all your pretty girlfriends?
But I waited for you, gave you time to decide
But you never saw it from anybody else's side

So I packed up my things and I faced up my doubts
You know, I think I will grow my hair back out
Never mind what you think, never mind what you like
I'll take it out to the streets for somebody else to admire

Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey, here comes my man
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey, here comes my man (Sha-la-la-la)

Maybe time will tell you why I got so much hell to sell you
Please, please understand me, oh you can't just dance around me
Maybe your work will love you when I'm just not there to hold you
(One of these, one of these, one of these, one of these, one of these days)
Maybe your pride can be your companion, oh but I just won't be there to stand for it
(One of these, one of these, one of these, one of these, one of these days)
Not one more minute will I stand for it

You found me singing, baby, oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey, here comes my man (Sha-la-la)
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey, here comes my man (Sha-la-la)

Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man (Sha-la-la)
Singing oh sha-la-la, oh sha-la-la
Listen honey here comes my man (Sha-la-la-la)

Here comes my man
Here comes my man
Here comes my man
Here comes my man
