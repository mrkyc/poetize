See, I've been here for twenty-eight years
Pounding sweat beneath these wheels
Tattooed lines beneath our skin
No surrender, my Bobby Jean

See, I've been here for twenty-eight years
Poundin' sweat beneath these wheels
We tattooed lines beneath our skin
No surrender, my Bobby Jean
And we've been burned by all our fears
Just from growing up around here
Our fathers' factories marked our cards
While Eden burned against the stars

And Sally said, Sally said
"I can't take no more regret
It cut us deep into our souls
Came and climbed into our bed"
And Sally said, Sally said
"Meet me by the river's edge
We're going to wash these sins away
Or else we won't come back again"

You know I had these ballroom dreams
That as a child came to me
I was a boy in Grandma's arms
A mother's pride and a wounded heart
And I was full with fiery wonder
You wore Audrey Hepburn pearls
You were the only one who understood me then
The only one who will

And now I drive the 101
On a California night
And I'm amazed at all the stars
Beneath that old Hollywood sign
And they waltz the ballet up the boulevard
To a place we never kept
And I'm not sure if we belong here
And if I never really left
Or if I can go home
Sally said, Sally said
"I can't take no more regret
It cut us too deep into our souls
Came and climbed into our bed"
Sally said, Sally said
"Meet me by the river's edge
We're going to wash these sins away
Or else we won't come back again, no"

No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
Meet me by the river's edge
No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
No retreat, no regrets
