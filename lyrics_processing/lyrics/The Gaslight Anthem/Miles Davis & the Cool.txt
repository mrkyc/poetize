Like Miles Davis
I've been swayed by the cool
There's just somethin' 'bout the summertime
There's just something 'bout the moon
So I laid a kiss on a stone
Tossed it upside your window by the roof
Before you change your mind
Miles, bring in the cool

Now, honey, put on your red dress
And your diamond-soled shoes
Climb on down from that window
Climb on outta your room
'Cause I never had a good thing
And I always had the blues
But I heard that you always kinda wondered
Miles, strike up the cool

Don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
See The Gaslight Anthem LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like
And the night is our own
Don't wait too long

Like poor Mr. Pitiful
I can't turn you loose
You move like a dream I had
I woke up sweatin' in my room
But your mama's got plans
And your daddy's aim is true
She never understood that it ain't no good
Papa never heard the cool
So now I've got up my nerve
And found me a stone
With a flick of the wrist and a turn of the key
You'll just fall in my arms

And don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on

And the night is our own
But you don't wait too long
So why don't you sing to me on this long drive home
And let the sound of your voice sway sweet and slow?
As we go down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground
We might always be blue
Jackson

So don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
No, don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on

As we go down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground
