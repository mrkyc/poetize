My teeth are crumbling structures
My thoughts are spider bites
I woke up and thought that I was dreaming
That we had reached the end of time
And maybe you're a goner
Oh, and maybe I survived
But I don't really believe it'll end like that
I'm sure I'll be the first to die
I'm sure I'll be the first to die

'Til then, we struggle for each other
'Til then, we struggle for each other

And on, and on, and on, and on it goes
We circle 'round the sun until someday we won't
And on, and on, and on it goes
And I'll love you forever 'til the day that I don't
'Til the day that I don't

We were young, the world seemed open
And every face we saw was a smile
Somewhere along all the masks came down
And their faces were something unkind
And I don't know when this will be over
I'm not sure we come back now
It's like this world was bitten by its own kinda venom
And it's gone too deep to suck the poison out
I don't know if it's true, but it feels like it is now

And so, we struggle for each other
And so, we struggle for each other

And on, and on, and on, and on it goes
We circle 'round the sun until someday we won't
And on, and on, and on it goes
And I'll love you forever 'til the day that I don't
'Til the day that I don't


And so, we struggle for each other
And so, we struggle for each other

And on, and on, and on, and on it goes
We circle 'round the sun until someday we won't
And on, and on, and on it goes
And I'll love you forever
