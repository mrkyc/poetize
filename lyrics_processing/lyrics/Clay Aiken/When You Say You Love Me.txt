I've been watchin' you from afar
And the way you make your way around the bar
You laugh like your're really entertained
And you smile like it's your favorite game
Now you're movin' closer to me
And our eyes are connected emotionally
I'm not lookin' for a one night stand
Or a place for a broken heart to mend

I know everybody here wants to hold ya
I know what it's like cause I feel the same
When you look in my eyes
There's a part of me that's still afraid

And when you say you love me
Do you mean it?
Baby, when you hold me
Do you feel it?
Should I believe the magic in your eyes?
I would wait until the end of time
To hear you say you love me
Like you mean it
Baby, when you hold me
Make me feel it
All I wanna do is make you mine
I've been hurt way too many times
You might also like
They say, if you wanna make God laugh
Then all you gotta to do is tell him your plans
I know that the timing's not right
Didn't know that I would meet you tonight
It's not that I don't really like the attention

I feel like the only man in the room
Are you really sincere?
Is this just somethin' that you do?

And when you say you love me
Do you mean it?
Baby, when you hold me
Do you feel it?
Should I believe the magic in your eyes?
I would wait until the end of time
To hear you say you love me
Like you mean it
Baby, when you hold me
Make me feel it
All I wanna do is make you mine
I've been hurt way too many times
Again and again and again
I've been hurt, my friend, 'til the end
You know I've been high, I've been low
I got no place left to go
Again and again and again
When will this search ever end?

And when you say you love me
Do you mean it?
Baby, when you hold me
Do you feel it?
Should I believe the magic in your eyes?
I would wait until the end of time
To hear you say you love me
Like you mean it
Baby, when you hold me
Make me feel it
All I wanna do is make you mine
I would wait until the end of time

Baby, say you love me
Come on, baby, say you love me
Oh (The magic in your eyes)
Ooh (Until the end of time)
When you say you love me
