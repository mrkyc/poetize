I'm tossing and turning in the dark
I try to make some sense of the mess that calls itself my life
Just wish I knew where I should start
I'd go back in time if I could
And erase you from my mind for good
I get so tired of trying
Maybe I should just...
Fly away let my heart pretend
My dream comes true and the story ends
I get on my feet and start again
And forget I ever knew you
I leave the past and rise above
I let you go and fall in love
With everything that I'm made of
Say goodbye to all I've been through
And forget I ever knew you
I turn the page I've got nothing to say but I'll start writing anyway
Something that gets me moving on again
Stuck in this place I'm putting one foot in front of the other foot
Maybe today I'll let this be over and done again
I'd make up my mind if I could
And leave this all behind me for good
I'm getting tired of trying
So maybe I should just...

With everything that I'm made of
Say goodbye to all I've been through
And forget I ever knew you
The sun can shine a little brighter now
I'm gonna make it on my own somehow
And I will start feeling alive again, yeah
I'll start living life with no regrets
'Cause the best hasn't happened yet
I'm just fine with you out of my life
I'll just, fly away let my heart pretend
My dream comes true and the story ends
