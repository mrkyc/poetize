Through my eyes
I have seen the world start spinning like a ball
Stars light up and then fall for you
So then what's a man like me supposed to do?
If I gave you the moon would you notice
That I'm right beside you?
Clay Aiken:
Well now a thousand days and thousand nights are not enough
Cause I can't hold back the way I feel about my love
Won't let it go, won't let it go
And if the angels came, I'd fight them back to win your soul
And when everything was said and done
They'd go back home
And they oughta know, they oughta know
That you're mine all mine
Graham Russell:
In my world
You're the sun that shines and lights up the evening skies
Clearing up the horizon, hold on
Come with me and I will never let you down
Oh, and in this love we'll drown, this I promise you
'Cause they can't hold us down
