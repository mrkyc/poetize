There's something 'bout the way you look tonight
There's something 'bout the way that I can't take my eyes off you
There's something 'bout the way your lips invite
Maybe it's the way that I get nervous when you're around
And I want you to be mine
And if you need a reason why

It's in the way that you move me, and the way that you tease me
The way that I want you tonight
It's in the way that you hold me, and the way that you know me
When I can't find the right words to say
You feel it in the way, oh
You feel it in the way

There's something 'bout how you stay on my mind
There's something 'bout the way that
I whisper your name when I'm asleep, oh girl
Maybe it's the look you get in your eyes (Your eyes)
Oh baby, it's the way that makes me feel to see you smile
And the reasons they may change
But what I'm feeling stays the same

It's in the way that you move me, and the way that you tease me
The way that I want you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the way that you hold me, and the way that you know me
When I can't find the right words to say
You feel it in the way
Oh, you feel it in the way
You might also like
I can't put my fingers on
Just what it is that makes me love you
You, baby
So don't ask me to describe
I get all choked up inside
Just thinkin' 'bout the way

It's in the way that you move me, and the way that you tease me
The way that I want you tonight (Tonight, oh)
It's in the way that you hold me (The way you hold me, yeah)
And the way that you know me (The way you know me)
When I can't find the right words to say (Feel it in the way)
It's in the way that you move me, and the way that you tease me
The way
Feel it in the way

There's something 'bout the way you look tonight
There's nothing more to say than
