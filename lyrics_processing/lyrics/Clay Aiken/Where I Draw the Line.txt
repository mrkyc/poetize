You're the best thing that ever happened to me
I melt every time we kiss
I never felt anything like this
It's almost too perfect
And just like the thunder brings the rain
Something beautiful brings on the pain
It looks like it's going to be the same this time around
I want to let you in but I don't know how
I've been here one to many times
Seems like whenever I let somebody get this close
I'm right back where I got hurt the most
And that's why, oh that's why
Around my heart is where I draw the line
I wish I could just forget
Not have one more regret behind me to remind me
What I've given up
Could I ever live with this
Knowing that I might have missed my last chance
For love to find me
I could stay here drowning in the rain
Unless you have the strength to save me
Nothing's going to change so much more
You might also likeAnd we can be the Kings and Queens of time around
I want to let you in but I don't know how
I've been here one to many times
Seems whenever I let somebody get this close
I'm right back where I got hurt the most
And that's why, oh that's why
Around my heart is where I draw the line
Either you're gonna rescue me
Or you're gonna be the death of me
It's going to be the same this time around
I want to let you in but I don't know how
I've been here one to many times
Whenever I let somebody get this close
I'm right back where I got hurt the most
And that's why, oh that's why
Around my heart is where I draw the line
