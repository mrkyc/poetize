I remain a trending topic I got out and they can't stop me
I got hoes for me they popping I got bros for me they pop it
I finesse while she caressing give me top when I be stressing
On her knees I make her bless me disrespect me and I stretch 'em
I remain a trending topic I got out and they can't stop me
I got hoes for me they popping I got bros for me they pop it
I finesse while she caressing give me top when I be stressing
On her knees I make her bless me disrespect me and I stretch 'em

I'm finessing, I'm flexing that's no question
In my dressing room undressing me a bad bitch who I be sexting
I don't call so she be texting, guess she ain't learn her lesson
Don't respond when I see her message so she  I'm guessing
But that, come with this music shit show the groupies I'm cruising with
Dont sell drugs, cause I'm using it off the flats I be losing it
I'm high, too high, I pop pills that heal niggas
If you try, you die, I got shortys that kill niggas
But I don't condone to that, I smoke the strongest pack
Sour diesel, pineapple express
I'm rollin the blunt while she giving me neck
Boss shit, smoke a whole ounce of the  like it do not cost shit
I rock True Religions no false shit, took her number down but I lost it
Now that's boss shit, right? Make up sex after we fight
Got no warranty for this ice, but all you got to show for your life is if I take it
Thanks to the Lord if I make it, thanks to my plug he's Jamaican
Feel super strong like he laced it, let's get it!

I'm the shit for real, 15 for my wrist for real
Everything that I spit is real, I ain't even gotta spit fo' real
Lot of niggas wanna diss, but still, same niggas ain't on shit, for real
Soon as a nigga get signed we like god damn this nigga just spent a mil
I got a lot of money problems
But still money ain't the problem
Bandana on my head, you would think I'm from Harlem, right?
That's my swag homie, now see everybody got bags homie
But everybody gon' jag on me
Trues off my ass they sag on me
That .40 on me gon' blast homie
Make a nigga do the 100 yard dash homie
Two shots and I promise you're ass homie
Never seen a nigga run so fast homie
But I'm cooling, like why, if you check the watch it's my time
I got bitches like a hot line
But I cut them hoes off like stop signs
But still I'm the topic of all these thots
My name come up when a nigga get shot
I'm on Front street with that bullshit crackin
But you ain't on the scene when the shit get hot
And that's how I play but the ref don't get it
The life that I'm living nigga death come with it
It's that or the king that's gon' try and make it
And if they don't give it to me motherfucker I'mma take it
