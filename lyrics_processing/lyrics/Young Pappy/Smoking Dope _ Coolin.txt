We just coolin', smoking dope
Ridin' 'round with my niggas (they're my niggas)
I don't mind nobody else business (get the fuck out of my business), no more
Cause' they gon' be a nigga, and they all gon' be a hoe
So I just do me, I flex, finesse, all that shit
My ex's getting texts, I dont call that bitch
Put money in the bra's of all my hoe's
Designer logo be on all my clothes
She know a real nigga when she see one
Tell me her man wanna be one, going with the reruns
I don't want to hear it, I'm cool
I just want to cool it with the crew

Okay cool, check, nigga I got hoes on deck
Tell a bad bitch that's tryna give me neck: "she ride for a nigga like he ride for his set"
But enough about that
Shorty all on me 'cause he can see I'm getting money, but I  put my homie before me
He saying get money, don't leave it to your 
Niggas been cappin', talking to me like they know me
But I don't know nothing about you, what your name is
I don't give a fuck about you or who you hang with
It's real in the field so the steel is stainless
The red dot, one shot, killed and it's painless
I be minding my own, I don't need no nigga I'm a man of my own
She  I can  because I don't give out my number
But I don't need a bitch tryna play on my phone
If you ain't tryna fuck, then what the fuck
Want me to be your man shorty, friends is enough
And I understand why they're saying he a bluff, that nigga really scared, he's just saying he'll be tough
But I'm just tryna to cool, I'm with the crew
I smoke a lot of weed, I buy a lot of shoes
And you could become a problem just like a lot of dudes
So if you're ain't tryna to cool nigga, what're you tryin' to do
Nigga I'm just tryna cool, I'm with the crew
I smoke a lot of weed, I buy a lot of shoes
You could become a problem just like a lot of dudes
So if you're ain't tryna to cool nigga, what're you tryin' to do nigga
I said: "If you're ain't tryna to cool nigga, what're you tryin' to do
Nigga?"
