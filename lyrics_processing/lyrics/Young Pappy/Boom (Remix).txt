It's catch a opp, whack a opp
Spot a opp, drop a opp
Boy I'm on that
I ain't gon' show it, unless a nigga gon' blow that
Boy, I got this bitch on me, better act like you know that
I got alot of money, never put a hoe before that
Paying they respects to a nigga, like they owe that
See, I'm from the pole, where it''s cold, where it snow at
Where if you ain't ridin' then my niggas come and tow that
I got hoes on my dick, man them hoes wanna eat for the fun
Bitch I got hoes got money, got guns
Niggas stay outta my business 'cause they know I ain't for none
You will get whacked, don't lack, nigga run
If you scared go to church, better act like a nun an still get taxed if you want a verse done
Got pills, weed, crack by the ton (hol' on!)
It's catch a opp, whack a opp
Nigga, we don't play around
My niggas still up with them guns, that'll lay em down
If them cops come patrolling, nigga we don't make a sound (shhh!)
That's how it's supposed to go
You up the pole, nigga, you was supposed to blow
My niggas post up on the corner, like they own the store
You better take your ass home before that chrome explode!
'Cus nigga I'm gon' blow, my bro gon' blow
Skeeno gon blow, Witzsco gon blow (let's

Semi-automatic, it take off a nigga back
Put the pump to his chest, like an asthma attack

Big ass gun that's dirty
Long ass clip hold thirty
Long ass barrel on the 
Semi-automatic on the K

And we don't give a fuck 'bout no hoes

Run up on you, MAC fully loaded, with the mask out
You a' get poked, tryna stunt with your cash out
All I roll is dope, get me fried 'till pass out
Catch a nigga lackin', he ain't got it, take his ass out
Dump a nigga body, like I'm 'bout to take the trash out

Boy, I know you fuck niggas don't want me to spazz out
I'm the last man niggas wanna fuck with
I don't give a fuck, tell a fuck nigga suck dick
Gucci, Louie, Prada, and designer, and a Trukfit
We out, blow him down if a nigga lookin' suspect
I know none of y'all niggas expect this
Word around town is Lil Spazz gon' wreck shit
Shout out to his neck, he ain't even want his necklace
And I don't want sex, bitch
I only want the neck, bitch

I just want the money, I ain't in it for the fame, nigga
You a lame .nigga, I don't know what came with ya
You a' get stained. you gon' get changed nigga
I don't bang with ya, never been insane with ya
You ain't PBG or TFG, I wouldn't hang with ya
Niggas say they don't fuck with me, I don't even blame niggas
'Cus I be poled up, hell ya, shown up
The windows rolled down, when I roll up
In a foreign ass car, doin' donuts
Boy, I'm from the Pole, where it's colder than cold cut
Double-M, 2 Cups, tear that pole up
The remix can't stop, bitch I go nuts
Thirty on me stickin' out, nigga, don't touch
Niggas know, and bitches know that I'm gon' buss
Man, niggas know I ain't for none of that (none of that)
I wish a nigga wood, like a lumberjack
Scotty off the Molly and Lil Von is rollin' up the yack
