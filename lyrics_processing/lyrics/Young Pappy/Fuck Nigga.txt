I only trust myself around nobody else
'Cause when you need you a hand, nobody plan is to help
Say, I don't trust these hoes, 'cause I know they'll get you nailed
And everybody saying I'm the man, but I'm just playing the hand I was dealt

Say I don't trust niggas
Them fake wanna be tough niggas
If don't fuck with you, that must mean you a fuck nigga
Say I don't trust niggas
Them fake wanna be tough niggas
If don't fuck with you, that must mean you a fuck nigga

I learned my lesson the hard way
Never listening to what my mom say
But I rather get caught with it on me
Then without it ain't that what we all say
Where I come from the city ain't no pity
You would get your life took in broad day
Swear to god I ain't just no anybody, so I gotta keep it on me always
Know some real niggas turn fake
Know a lot of rats, know a lot of snakes
Gotta watch my back, niggas know my face
Make sure I don't lack, keep it on waist
I don't trust niggas or bitches either, only hoe I trusted was that bitch Nina
You a damn lie, you say "she ain't no keeper"
Only smoke niggas, she don't smoke my reefa
Brother always taught me how to play it smart
I don't play no games, I just play my part
I'm a little nigga with a lot of heart
Who ain't never had none from the start
I'm from Uptown nigga where it's dark
It was never fun playing at the park
Where I grew up on guns, drugs and the narcs
Never see the sun over here it's dark
Call me what you want, just don't call the police on me
Don't say shit about me if you don't know me homie
Need my shit up out you if you owe homie
You say I'm a hoe, then come and show me homie
And I ain't tolerating all this snake shit
Undercover talking to the jakes shit
If they ask, you ain't gotta say shit
'Cause it's something I'm going to the grave with (fuck 12)

I'm a youngin' that been through it all, nigga
From shoot outs to brawls, nigga
I only got my word and my balls, nigga
Ask me if I trust you, I say "nah", nigga
I've been in these streets a long time
Waiting on my moment, like a long line
I done got snaked by my own kind
In the wrong place at the wrong time
Momma said "come home" and I ain't never listen
I was busy in somebody else's kitchen trying to find a definition
Of a prison 'cause that's what was paying for my True Religions
But I promise to you momma I'ma make it somewhere
And your son on the radio station somewhere
When I make it, I swear I'ma take you somewhere
You can live like you on a vacation somewhere
R.I.P my niggas, swear to god I miss them
Just know you gone meet them if you ever diss them
A deuce and a liter, two grams and a Swisher
Two of everything for my brother Mensa
Love by few but hated by many
Trying to rob who? Boy, I'm not for any of that bull
Said I'm quick to up my semi
Nigga tweaking, I'ma let off this whole 50!
I only trust myself around nobody else
'Cause when you need you a hand nobody plan is to help
Say I don't trust these hoes 'cause I know they'll get you nailed
And everybody saying I'm the man
But I'm just playing the hand I was dealt

Say I don't trust niggas

If don't fuck with you, that must mean you a fuck nigga
Say I don't trust niggas
