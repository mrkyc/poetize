Ahuh, now I'm on some other shit
I just took some time for a case but it was nothing, shit
I be with my niggas if I'm not I'm with my brothers bitch
And we could fuck your mom, your sister, your baby mother, shit
All this shit these niggas be talking bout it's irrelevant
They talking til that shit get to spark and now ain't no telling
Niggas ducking, running in any open direction
Now doctors performing surgery, opening and dissecting
Them body parts, bet that'll teach a nigga a lesson
Screaming free all my hittas I'm knowing them niggas stressing
Shorty all on my dick cause she knowing how we be checking
We blow em like we be reppin she throwing shit I'mma catch it
Right? Since I been home a lot of hoes been tryna fuck me
I got hoes, I could call the baddest bitch ugly
I got poles, guns so old, the clips rusty
And I'm back down, pack so loud that shit musty
Silly bitches, see me in public, do not touch me or talk to me
It ain't even safe to walk with me
I got guys I'm ready to smoke, I bought 50
And that dope make me choke, I pass she cough with me
Damn I hate a nigga that lie on top of a lie
Shorty don't even smoke, she high on top of the sky
Tell me what niggas know about chopping down on a pie
Fiend tucked in the coat, he overdose and he die
Tell me what niggas know about breaking down on a pound
Don't even open the bag, already know I'm this loud
Pops come in the crib, ain't gotta open the door
I got the house so loud he thinking I just smoked
All that lil shit that used to excite me
Til I did that time and niggas ain't write me
Talking my ears off bout how I'm better than those
Come to think about it, shit, I got more letters from hoes
But, that's lil shit, I ain't thinking bout that
I came home to some money I'm ready to bounce back
Mama told me niggas phony and now that's a known fact
But my circle would've been smaller if I'd have known that hah!

Ahuh, now I'm on some more shit
Everybody got bags now? That's my old shit
Nigga got so much cash now I can't fold it
And if I'm with a bitch then I make her ass hold it
Fuck it! Gun so big I can't tuck it
Got some money put up, my bro say I can't touch it
The cops had some goof ass warrant, we couldn't duck it
Had so much fucking work in the crib, we couldn't flush it
I'll tell you bout this bitch I knew, but she disgusting
What she could do on the dick, no telling who she was fucking
I done passed to my bros and she was okay with it
I bought an AK, and the blade came with it
Damn, I must admit it we blowing that nigga fitted
Shorty say, "where you going?" she knowing I wanna hit it
The semi that I'm toting knock a nigga off his pivot
I been riding in a foreign not a civic, you get it?
I ain't gotta speak or talk too much
And since I'm paid, I'll never say it costs too much
I'm steady rolling up dope, must have bought too much
And I started playing with guns cause I fought too much
Right? Now that's real, I feels on that steel
To heal I got pills from weed to crack kills
Shorty heard me spit, said I need to sign a deal
But if it's meant to be, I will
They say I got the juice, told me don't let it spill
Lil Biggie got into it, I call his ass still
You catch me in the booth, if not I'm in the field
