They be on my dick and shit
Want my autograph
Wanna take a pic and shit
I'm from off the Ave
They be moving bricks and shit
Got like 40 shorties and they all be hitting licks and shit
We be getting money, nigga
Any type of way
Snowy or it's sunny, nigga
Any type of day
I told broski not to hit the fiend, 'cuz he look like the jakes
So tell his ass he gotta taste it, or smoke it in yo face
I mean it's extra, but it's safe, 'cuz I don't need a case
I don't walk the streets, I run them
That's why I don't need the race
Rolling grams outta 7
My lil homie keep the shakes
And I don't care if you in first or not
I put you in yo place
'Cuz it's real where I'm from
Where I hang at, they shoot dice and slang crack
Lost my nigga Pooh Bear to the game
I seen pain Jack
Same niggas you hanging with
Same niggas I aim at
Bodybag a nigga
 coming, I ain't saying jack
Wishing knocking to get a couple of my people's back
Lost a couple real niggas
Three to be exact
But I won't let a nigga take me
So I keep it on me but it's off safety
Me and my niggas my niggas
Gon' always be my niggas
They gone always keep some bitches
They gone always keep some pistols
They gone always keep it real
And I always keep a hitta by my side
Down to ride
He ready for homicide
I used to gangbang with a lot of niggas
Slang 'caine, hit a main stain with a lot of niggas
Now I'm in the cut, poled up, like Osama, nigga
And I got this money on me like I hit the lotto, nigga
And I'm rarely on Twitter so don't follow, nigga
When I'm smoking gas when you hit it, you can't swallow, nigga
Niggas say they with it
I done heard that from a lot of niggas
Try and dodge a bullet
Gone pull it
I got hollows nigga
And I hope I see my niggas in the afterlife
Aw, you getting taxed for white
My niggas get the after price
I see shorty on me for my money
So I have to pipe
I approach a nigga face-to-face
And I don't have to fight

Niggas know, and bitches know
It's the Fuckin' Guys in my fucking eyes, still
