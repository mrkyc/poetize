R.I.P. my dead mans
Free my niggas in the can
I got shorties who lost homies that's just out here for revenge
Bitch, my toolie tucked
Bitch, I'm Truey'd up, can't say shit to me
I'll get you whacked
Features get you taxed, can't get shit for free

I'm coolin' how I be coolin', I got hoes all on my dick
They be lying like they know me, tryna pose all in my pics
Give these niggas a reason to hate, they be listening to my shit
I be doing this shit for y'all and I ain't gon' stop 'till I get rich, bitch
Long ass clip, that's 30
Got a body on this bitch, that's dirty
Niggas say they want me dead, but I ain't worried
'Cause this .40'll turn a nigga brains to a McFlurry
I be ridin' with this motherfucker, flyer than a motherfucker
Nina so friendly, have you shyer than a motherfucker
Pop a lot of pills, I be higher than a motherfucker
Bitch, I be outside, I ain't hiding from no motherfucker
What's understood ain't gotta be explained
If I wasn't in the hood, I'd settle for the fame
Told broski, "I'm good, I already got a name"
I'll rather buy a chain and a Range, put some things on that bitch
Let me sounds rang on that bitch
Grab shorty, run a train on that bitch
Told 'er: "I just want some brain and that's it
'Cause if you wanna fuck, you gon' have to let gang and 'nem hit!" (Gang)

I can't take myself, man, shorty can't take me neither
And that bitch say she don't even like niggas
Well, that's okay, me neither
Shorty, all that faithful shit for the birds, so a bitch won't play me neither
I left with the same niggas that I came with 'cause if they don't wanna stay, me neither
Shorty all on my dick 'cause I got a lot of money and I'm already knowin'
By the age of 13, I was already blowin'
By the age of 14, I was already scoring
I done seen a lot of shit in my lifetime
A lot of hoes, mo' bitches than a lifetime
A lot of poles, catch you slippin' and the right time
See the light shine, face shot, bitch, your life mine!
Right there on the floor where he lay
Told him: "Get up," but know that he can't
The way he got hit up remind me of Blake
Call that boy, the "John Doe," he can not see his face
I cannot feel my face, I be so under the influence
All of them attempts and them bodies I been doing
Braggin' 'bout shit that lil' Shotty 'nem been doing
Bitch, we got bodies on bodies, you been knewing
My teacher told me I wasn't gon' be shit 'cause I smoked too much weed
Crazy 'cause I passed her class with a B
She just didn't like me 'cause I hung in the streets
And she knew I did dirt with them niggas
Same niggas who failed her class, I was puttin' in work with them niggas
The nerve of you niggas, talkin' 'bout I ain't on shit
You can end up on a shirt with your niggas
Pillow talkin' that shit 'bout who better
They talkin' that shit, but whatever
She sucked my dick and I swear I just met her
She wanna be my bitch, but I swear I won't let her
'Cause I don't got time for you bitches
And please don't put your hand out 'cause I don't have a dime for you bitches
My nine is extended, so whoever try me gon' get it
They see me? You die with your witness
Shorty all white like Mensa
Gucci, Louie, Truey or Lay-Lay
I be going cray-cray
Nigga try to rob me for payday
Hell nah, nigga, that shit Day Day
Smokin' on Day Day
I'll never stop going in like Rich Homie Quan in this bitch
And I will never ever seen the drought
But if I go broke, somebody gon' starve in this bitch

Niggas know and bitches know
