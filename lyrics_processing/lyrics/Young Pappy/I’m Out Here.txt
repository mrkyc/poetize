Where niggas ride up and let windows down
I got a MAC hold fifty
Take a nigga whole window down
I'm from the Pole where it's cold, everybody riding 'round with extendos now (extendos)
TEC-9 hold forty-six shots, hit every nigga in yo crowd
True, it's not a new mane (no)
Ride in the blue thang, that's the new Range
With a little cute thang, call her boo thang
She pop molly, smoke weed, do a few thangs
When it crack, don't lack, keep two thangs
And stay fresh from the vest to the shoe game
Bandana on me look too strange
But I'm fly, no lie, like 2 Chainz
I'm from the block where it's hot, 'cus the narcs outside
Where the bodies drop and that Glock spark outside
The kids don't play in the park outside, 'cus they scared for they life when it's dark outside
When the thugs on the block got drugs on the block
Got dimes of the kush, got dubs on a rock
My name hold weight, got plug on the block
Give me top for the free, I ain't jugging a thot
The good die young and the bad don't die
Who the fuck told you "A real man don't cry"?
They took 2 Cups, so my head in denial
Looking for any nigga that was friends with the guy
They killed my homie
Boy, you niggas gon' pay that was behind that shit
I'm riding 'round with it on me
And nigga I ain't gon' stop 'til I find that bitch
And I got my niggas with me
Ready for action
You talk about bodies?
They ready to catch it
Been blowin' shit down since the age of 11
Been totin' any gun from a gauge to a 7
They with it
My lil niggas with it
You say he shot Dooney and he not gon' to admit it
We come through and aim for the top of your fitting
And let that bitch bang
We don't stop for no witness
I'm out here, I'm in it, nigga
When you gon' stop?
When I'm finished, nigga
Roll up quick, I walk up on that nigga
Put that gun in his mouth like a dentist, nigga
I'm the same, nigga
I can't change, nigga
Done it all boy
She wanna fuck, wanna suck
Shit, I'm all for it
I be shooting shit up like a small force
She try set a nigga up, can't fall for it
Y'all niggas ain't getting no money
So what the fuck y'all do with your time?
Because time is money and money is time
And if they say otherwise, they lying
Boy, I done been through it all
From the guns to the brawls
The bigger that shell, then the harder they fall
Right now gettin' money, ain't a damn thing running
Said the bigger that pill, then the harder they ball
You might also likeTFG and PBG, that's what I rep my nigga
So fuck all y'all niggas
Except my niggas
Step out of his side each time we in the ride
Boy I ain't ever left my niggas
Kush smokin' on fire, so high
In this shit right here
Goddamn, my nigga
Double G's on the belt, my nigga
What you brought?
I don't need help, my nigga
You ain't feel the same pain that I felt, my nigga
You ain't played the same hand that I was dealt, my nigga
What the fuck?
These niggas don't get it
Try walk in my shoes, but these niggas don't fit it
Fuck the police, no law no limits
I'm a real ass nigga, no clone no gimmicks (bitch)
I don't play no games
I'mma kill that boy, I don't say no names (no names)
With that trey eight
Hop in the whip, no face no case
I don't play no games
I'mma kill that boy, I don't say no names (no names)
With that trey eight
Hop in the whip, no face no case
I'm out here, ten toes down
Where niggas ride up and let windows down
I got a MAC hold fifty
Take a nigga whole window down
I'm from the Pole where it's cold, everybody riding 'round with extendos now
TEC-9 hold forty-six shots, hit every nigga in yo' crowd
I'm out here, where niggas don't lack
Where shorties ride up and them domes roll back
I ain't fear no man
You don't pose no threat
You ain't jacking no bag
You don't own no check
The fuck?
Man, niggas don't get it
Try walk in our shoes, but these niggas don't fit it
Fuck the police, no law no limits
I'm a real ass nigga, no clone no gimmicks (bitch)
I don't play no games
I'mma kill that boy, I don't say no names (no names)
With that trey eight
Straight hop in the whip, no face no case
No face no case
No face no case
