2 Cups
Don't sleep on me

Bandana, bandana, when he say bandana
Say double G, I done told motherfuckers not to fuck with me
Everything designer, plus my bitch designed up
(What else?) I got bags, bitch
But nigga everybody got bags, bitch
And nigga everybody gone jagg, bitch
Trues off my ass they saggin'
(What else?) I'm from the pole, homie
That's where it's cold, you will get froze, homie
Niggas know and bitches know, homie
Quick to blow a nigga down if you don't know, homie
(let's get it)
I came to wake niggas up
(For what?) Cause they sleep on us
And bitch we the shit but we don't flush
Going hard til' they put them white sheets on us
Spot a opp, drop a opp don't blink, just bust
Smoke loud, real loud, that stank, that must
And niggas hate me cause I can't be touched
And I love getting money so it can't be lust (right?)
You damn right about that
If a nigga want smoke, I'll light up his hat
And you will get whacked, know I'm right about that
I result to the pipe, I don't fight about jack
And I ain't got time for a bitch right now
If it ain't money then it don't make sense right now
A lot of these niggas wanna bang with us
You tryna hang with us and get lynched right now
(Freaky) I'm smoking on some hazy shit
Got me chilling like a villain on some lazy shit
And this money make a nigga do some crazy shit
So I'm crazy in love with that crazy bitch
I go and get it cause a nigga never gave me shit
I got dumb money cause I wasn't raised with it
I got a K, when I spray I don't aim for shit
Cause I'm a real nigga, boy I wouldn't change for shit
And I'm riding round my side of town
Them hoes see a nigga stuntin' so they flag me down
Rock jeans on my ass, they saggin' down
Lot of cash, lot of bags, I ain't bragging now
I got goons that'll blow when it come to a nigga
Opps see me and they know, better run from a nigga
I don't write, just spit, when it come to a nigga
Got a cannon like Nick, put this drum to a nigga
And PBG, that's my clique
I just made a DVD with your bitch
That hoe like EVE, she so thick
You go home and give her a kiss, she so slick
Boy I got everything that you want
And I got everything that you got
These fuck niggas imitating my swag
Because I'm everything that they're not, Goofy!
