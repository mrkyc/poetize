We just coolin, smoke dope
Riding round with my niggas, and Munchie
I ain't mind nobody else business, no more
Cause a nigga gone be a nigga, and a hoe gone be a hoe
So I just do me, I flex, finesse, all that shit
My ex send a text, I don't call that bitch
Put money and the bros over all my hoes
Designer logos be on all my clothes
She know a real nigga when she see one
Tell me how her man wanna be one, go on with the reruns
I don't wanna hear it, I'm cool, I just wanna cool it with the crew
Okay cool, check, nigga I got hoes on deck
Got a bad bitch and she tryna give me neck
And she ride for a nigga like he ride for his set
What you know about that?
Shorty all on me cause she see I'm getting money
But she gotta do my homie, before me
You say you getting money don't believe it til you show me
Niggas making conversations talking to me like they know me
But I don't know nothing bout you, what your name is
I don't give a fuck about you or who you hang with
It's real in the field so the steel here is stainless
The red dot one shit kill and it's painless
I be minding my own, I don't need no nigga, I'm a man of my own
She tell me I'm conceited cause I ain't give her my number but
I don't need a bitch tryna play on my phone
Cause if you ain't tryna fuck, then what the fuck?
Want me to be your man? Shorty friends is enough
Said I don't understand why they saying you a bluff
And a nigga really scared, he just say it like he tough
And I'm just tryna cool, I'm with the crew
Smoke a lot of weed, I buy a lot of shoes
And you could become a problem, just like a lot of dudes
So if you ain't tryna cool, nigga what you tryna do?
And I'm just tryna cool, I'm with the crew
Smoke a lot of weed, I buy a lot of shoes
And you could become a problem, just like a lot of dudes
So if you ain't tryna cool, nigga what you tryna do, nigga?
Said if you ain't tryna cool, nigga what you tryna do, nigga?

All my hoes? They be doing dicks
All my bros? They don't be on shit
We be cooling, posted up with them ratchets
We ain't starting shit, but we definitely ain't ducking no action
We smoking on a pack, roll up, face that
I don't flodge to a bitch, niggas know I state facts
See a nigga tryna make it, everybody hate that
Only fuck with real niggas, everybody hate that
I be riding round smoking on gas lil nigga
No new friends, I ain't gotta pass to a nigga
You see I don't fuck around, so you mad at a nigga
Why you hating you should go and take a bath lil nigga
Get some money nigga, why you keep hating?
Want me to fall off? Nigga you can keep waiting
Shorty run up face to face, like a FaceTime date
