Uh, it's TFG, man
Young Pappy in this bitch, man
Niggas know and bitches know
Fuck nigga, I got a warrant and shit
They say I'm active, fuck is that?
I mean... I am with the shits
You can say I'm Die L's for Alex
I'm L's up for L-Dub
Come me active, fuck it, man!
I'm with this TFG shit
Niggas know it's The Fucking Guys in my fucking eyes!

Uh, my word play is amazing, graces
Ain't shit changed, bitch, the same shit every since
Grade six, played with switchblades at the age six
And stayed with some niggas that had stayed on some payed shit
You was on some going to church and getting saved shit
I was on some chopping down crack with a razor shit
You was on some hating shit cause I was on some paper shit
I was on some, "If the money run, then I'ma chase the shit"
Hawk it down
Sure my flow cold like the Hulk around
Tote .4's, tell the po-po's, "Bring the chalk around!"
Cough it up, nigga that's the loud what I'm coughing up
If you only matching one blunt, you ain't bought enough
You ain't buy enough
Nigga, "Hi, hater
Bye, hater"
Motherfucker better get to stepping like they got data
I'm just on my paper shit
You can be on yours
I find out you steady checking bags, I'm on yours
Kick it down
Ah, you gon' brag? Nigga, stick around!
Ambulance'll pick you up, my mans he'll stick you up
My word play is preposterous
You lie, you say you hot as this
You not and shit, so you might as well honor this
Honor's class, teaching niggas how to roll pot in class
You can ask my eighth grade teacher, you was not in class
That's where the money at when I was in class
I was selling dime bags in biology class
In chemistry class, I was mixing Kush with the purp
If a nigga stop my money, he get put on a shirt
Get murked
Nigga, I ain't used to getting what I want
Then crying like a bitch when I don't, that's some hoe shit
I just get with it, go and get it, and some mo' shit
And then some mo' shit, whatever floats my boat, shit
My wordplay is immaculate
I got the C, he got the D, I'm hackin' it
7-4, I'm stacking it
Whatever I was packing with that clip was extended, so
Don't be a menace to society while drinking your juice in the hood
Got juice in the hood
Nigga, I'm just tryna eat, Bruce Bruce in the hood
Niggas that be tryna kick it like Bruce in the hood
I swear to God, boy, them niggas so fake to me
I hate to see a nigga that knew he could've made it
Give his life to the hood cause school was what he hated, uh
Uh, my word play is amazing, graces
Ain't shit changed, bitch, the same shit every since
I was up in high school
High school was my school
Had every bitch that had walked out of night school
I wasn't at night school, I was on the block with it
I was selling rocks with it
30 popper Glocks with it
Any nigga disrespect me sending shots to his dome
To his home, sending threats to his phone
Them niggas they gon' pay me the respect that they owe
Got a TEC that'll spit from his neck to his toes
From the neck in the woods, got respect in the hood
Cause I came out the woods with a vest made of wood
With a slingshot and a nail gun to survive
Yo best bet is to not run, nigga, hide
Not one, nigga, five, that's how many I'ma buss at you
Goons can't fit in the truck, I'ma send a bus at you
I tell them bust at you, niggas gon' do it
Tell 'em "Ready, aim, fire" and my nigga gon' shoot it
I got goons, that got goons, that got goons, that got got mo'
Got goons that sell crack
Got goons that go blow
You got goons that play ball
You got gons that's gon' hoop
I got goons that stick D
I got goons that's gon' shoot
I tell the judge, "Straight like this, motherfuck you, bitch, and that robe that you got on
Take it off, it's regular clothes that you got on
So who gave you the right to judge me, Sherlock Holmes?"
I'm not on right now, but I will be
Til I get signed, in the hood I will still be
One corner rocks, one corner where the pills be
Other corner weed, you can tell from where the sills be
I be where the money at, I be where they cash at
I be getting cash, but a check, I never cashed that
Shop with your mask up to come and get that cash back
That's where I call cashing checks where the Ave at
Aye Lawrence Ave, LDubb where the ave at
The fuck? Nigga, now do the math, rat
