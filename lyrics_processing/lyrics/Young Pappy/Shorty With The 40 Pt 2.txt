He said yeah but La'veil can't tell if this lil nigga serious
So he gotta ask Rell, so Rell put the other half on his bail
Said if shorty ain't 100 then his ass getting nailed
Shorty bond 100,000 to walk, he dont really know Veil
So he think he all talk but Veil got it he ain't thinking

So La'veil got released on the 5th told shorty just wait
