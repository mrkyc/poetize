I'm like, "Hoe, let's get straight to it"
All I gotta say, "Let's do it"
Give a nigga so much brain she clueless
You had your chance, goddamn, but you blew it? Fuck?
RIP my bro PB, and you know me I'm PBG
So bring them niggas up to a L.O.C
Die L's we do that A-L-O-T
But I ain't tryna put them niggas on
So I'mma stop mentioning them in my songs
I'm finna sound like Kanye, but I spit like Jay
So a nigga better watch my throne, hold on

Riding around in this Maybach
But I ain't signed with Maybach
I'm addicted to paychecks
Wanna put that shit up? Boy, I take that
Bought me a ounce of the yack, that dope
Bought a Rolex with the tales I've wrote
Got me a Mac that's equipped with a scope
That's some shit that'll put a nigga head on a slope
Make a nigga wanna get down
Fuck around me? Fuck around, get found
And I'm from the Pole, where it's cold, got poles so loud
It'll make a nigga wanna skip town
That bitch go boom, my whip go zoom
And free my brother Prince, man he coming home soon
My brothers got guns, same guns off DOOM
Coming through, blowing in a Halloween costume
I done popped every molly, every pill you can think
My eyes so fucked, you would think I don't blink
And free my nigga Trav, free Skrilla, free Blinks
Guns get to drawing like I'm handing out ink
I smoke that strong, that gas, that stink
I got a bad bitch, pussy wetter than a sink
And niggas get mad, wanna hate, 'cuz I'm hot
I'm the same nigga made sure you ain't on the block
Tell a nigga, "Make way, lil nigga, I'm back"
TFG the squad, lil nigga, we back
All my niggas young, and they all tote straps
And we all we got, so my niggas don't lack, hold on
Lil nigga, I'm back
TFG the squad, lil nigga, we back
All my niggas young, and we all tote straps
And we all we got, so my niggas don't lack, hold on
Take a hit of this yack
Put me on your track, and you will get taxed
I got another ounce, lil nigga, no sacks
And I ain't smoking loud 
And I been getting money with the bros
Counting, stunting, Glock with a silencer that sound like nothing
I point it at the crowd, and they all get to running
Anybody stick around getting what they got coming
A bitch tell me I made her sick to her stomach
But we'll be back, 'cuz I put this dick in her stomach
