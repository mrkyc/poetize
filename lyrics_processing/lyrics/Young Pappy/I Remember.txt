Shout out Tay Savage
What I'm going through
They don't understand what I'm going through
I don't think they understand what I'm going through
I don't think they understand it

Wait, hol' on!

I don't think these niggas understand what I'm going through
They don't get what I'm saying, so I'm better off just showing you
I do this for my mans that ain't never coming home
And my fans that literally know every word to my songs
My brother gone, but I'm still holding strong
Look in my eyes, you'll never know what's wrong
Sometimes I cry, but I'm still holding on
Look in my eyes, you'll never know what's wrong

I remember them days
When I used to ask mamma:
"Could I bring my friends over?"
She like, "Boy, what's your problem?
I done told you plenty times that you ain't got no friends"
I ain't never understand, so I still brung 'em in
Now I get what she was saying
Niggas never did shit for me, so when I sign that deal, niggas ain't gon' get shit for free
I swear the police sick of me
They know that I'm still in these streets
So I take they publicity they give me to that industry
Fuck all these niggas
Fuck, fuck, fuck all these hoes
They know I got a bitch, so fuck you call me for?
'Cause they know I'm having shit
Got so much money I'll buy that bitch
I don't need no average bitch if my girl be on that savage shit
Yeah, I love that girl (heh)

They don't understand where I'm coming from
Them 20's, 50's, them 100's on me
They like: "Damn, where you get your money from?"
I'm strapped up, what the fuck I'm runnin' from?
Unless I see twelve, then I might just bail
These niggas wanna see me go back to jail
But I'll be damned if I let a nigga see me fail
Damn, homie, thought you was my mans, homie
You was supposed to ride when shit hit the fan, homie
You act like I died when I was in the can, homie
I wish they was lyin' 'bout the shit that they was saying, homie
But it was true
My bro told me, so I knew
And even though you forgot about me
Just know I'll never forget about you
And the shit you said, nigga
And that funny ass shit you did, nigga
You couldn't be serious, nigga
Just know that you burned this bridge, nigga
So when I make it, it's only a few of my niggas I'm taking
Drinkin' dark liquor like I'm racist
Poppin' so many pills got my heart racing
Do all these drugs 'cause I can't face the pain
Swear I can't take the pain
Pop two pills, smoke two blunts, and two cups, I escape the pain
