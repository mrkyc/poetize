Flexed up turned a nigga savage
I swear i don't give a fuck 'bout shit now
My bitch do everything for me
I don't even give a fuck 'bout my bitch now
Gotta couple labels calling my phone
So I'm finna hit the block with a whole brick now
Make shorty 'nem get down with the get down
Standing up ; lil homie's make his ass sit down
Shorty I got clout
Know you better watch your mouth
Cause I got a couple hittas out South
That'll pop up at a nigga crib and he already in
Like they got a set of keys to your house
Got a couple hoes thick and pretty as fuck
That'll set a nigga up for a lil bit of nothing
Then they ain neen got a problem with you fucking
After the job done they just want they money
The real live, definition of savage
Steal a nigga life like he 'ain want me to have
Yo bitch wanna fuck cause she know that you're average
Designer logos be on all of my fabrics
Swear imma go crazy on all of these tracks
A Whole crump in her face why she calling me back
If I don't answer, she gone keep calling back
Texting me like "why you never follow me back"
They keep calling me this ,they keep calling me that
But I won't give a fuck, what a hater got to say about me
They let me out papers got bond money on deck
So the county, they won't get a day up out me
I got shorties trynna put in work for me
It's Like 10 , 11 years old
I never expected this, I used to give them dollars
Since they was like 7 years old
Now they bad ass asking me for poles
They know every word to all of my songs
Unknown numbers calling my phone
I 'ain trynna talk, leave me alone
Know me, I'm from the pole where it's cold
Really on the road somewhere doing shows
You can catch me on the mag with the moes
Posted on Sunny Side with some hoes
But I'm off Lawrence side where the folks be at
How you looking for, hoe, you know where we at
Not from over there, but you over there
Don't get caught somewhere, you 'ain post to be at
If you hanging with em we gone let it be that
Why you taking pictures where you never be at?
Gotta keep that bitch on us wherever we at
If you scared go to Church where the reverend be at
You might also likeAnd I ain scared nigga, how I be lacking if I ain dead nigga
I'll put a quarter pound on yo head watch shorty smoke it off
With his friends nigga, once you dead nigga
I'm the man, nigga . I can't stand niggas
I used to do the hits, now I'm paying niggas
Since the 30, I get caught again
But I keep that bitch on me just cause I can 
Fuck a friend, I keep Spazz with me
I know my lil brother gone blast with me
If you run he gone get on yo ass with me
Keep my gun, and some weed, and some cash with me
Fuck a bitch nigga, and his bitch, nigga
Gino wet him up, he drench niggas
Try to set me up, but you missed nigga
I'm from the pole where it's colder than bricks nigga
It's the fucking guys in my fucking eyes
Be this way till the day I go fucking blind
Got a couple 40s got a couple 9s
Give them to my shorty show em where to find all the opps at
Pop that, never mind where the cops at
My gat, it'll knock a nigga block back
Fuck tatianna where the thots at?
If you fuck around with the fuck around
You gone fuck around, and get fucked around
Keep the 30, I just need a couple rounds
Head shots got a nigga ducking down
Red dots got a nigga shook
Face shots make a nigga look
I be going hard, got these niggas hooked
Spitting only bars like a nigga booked
Me and B.U double ride in a foreign flying pass niggas
Act like we don't know them
They say we gone make it Broski, we gone show them
Phoney ass niggas, ain got nothing for them
They say when I come thru I be performing
Either cook a nigga like I'm George Foreman
Nina Sarafina that's my lil bitch
She'll do yo whole clique
