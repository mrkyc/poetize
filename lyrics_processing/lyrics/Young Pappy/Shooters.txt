Bitch, we got a squad full of shooters
We move with them AK's and Rugers
We don't sneak diss on computers
We just send Lil Kemo to do you
Lil Shawn don't fight, I just up pipes
Then I strike, make him go, "Good night!"
Took his bitch, now a nigga wanna fight
Give him sores like a hive
Was acting tough worth losing your life?
(Was it, nigga?)
Nah, I ain't thank so
I'm just lookin' for some brain like a scarecrow
Spittin' bars like a nigga on death row
Treat his ass like the dope, he can get smoked
If he holdin' work, he get poked
Fuckin' on the throat, make a lil' bitch choke
And I hang with them Insanes, Cutthroat
Bullets make his foot work like jump rope
Wait a minute, we in the jam, so get low!
Say they drillin', but they lying like a Leo
Out west, too turnt in the Veno
And I heard niggas dissin' on Pooh Bear
That's the reason why we smokin' on Keno

Gang, gang
Gang, gang
Gang, gang
Gang, though

My pop out from the T with Folks 'nem
My serve a couple keys to Moe 'nem (Hoolies)
Don't hit the block without my Glock, I tote them
I get the drop and catch a opp, I smoke him, and that's it!
Ain't no none of that extra shit, unless it's a extra clip
This brand new TEC, I'm ready to test this bitch
And I ain't gon' aim, but bet I stretch some shit
'Cause bro taught me to shoot
And then I taught Folks how to shoot
Nigga, you don't even know how to shoot
I ain't sayin' I'm a pro when I shoot, but the opps can't flex on my name
Niggas know what I do
Walk ups, and I ride up, nigga
Either way, you gon' fired up, nigga
Have Spazz hop out of the back with the MAC
Dreads shakin', point him out, he like: "Where that nigga at?"
Oh, don't nobody know shit now?
Stop flexing! You ain't gon' blow shit down
This four-nickel got so much kick, when I let this bitch spit
Even I'm gon' get down
A lot of hoes on my dick, I can pick now
This MAC got a cooling kit with a switch now
Silencer, so my Glock sound like this now
Shh! (Pew, pew, pew-pew, pew, pew, pew)
