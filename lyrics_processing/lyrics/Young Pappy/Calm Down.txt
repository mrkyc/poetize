Bro told me calm down, I'm like "fuck that"
Hoes try and set me up, can't trust that
Heard Boom, niggas know I'm gon' bust that
Got a tommy gun call that bitch a Rugrat
You can catch me on the K, where I'm thuggin' at
Nigga better fix his face, "Who you mugging at?"
Run up in a nigga place, where his mother at
Put the gun to his sister face, "Where your brother at?"
I know niggas more savage than me
Got money on his head, they'll whack him for free
Say, A, B we got C and D
Gas tank on E, nigga that's on the G
And I, F'd up, 'cuz I don't fail, nigga
I did a lotta time, 'cuz I don't tell, nigga
He ask my name, it ring bells, nigga
Ask me what I claim? I'm die L's, nigga
Still, nigga
And fuck niggas, I don't fuck with 'em
'Cuz when you fuck with fuck niggas, then you stuck with 'em
I know you better duck, 'fore you get slumped wit 'em
Say he ride with you, you can ride in this trunk with 'em, snatch off
Put a bag on your head, what does that cost?
Lil money, get yo ass whacked for a scratch-off
Headshot knock more than a patch off
Boy, I'm from the pole where its colder than Jack Frost
Damn, but that's cold
Niggas love "Competition", but that's old
Niggas love "Days and Days", but that's old
Niggas love "Smokin' Shit", but that's old
Wait, hold on
You might also likeI'mma go hard, after all that

Glock .40, I don't need a pencil to draw that
My dick where she put her lip gloss at, ugh
Shorty don't care that I fucked her friend
Just like I don't care that she fucked my man
'Cuz I'mma fuck her, then shake folks' hand like:
"Bro, now I see what you were saying"
And that bitch nasty
Smoking on Blake, first ash it
See how it taste, then pass it
That shit drastic
Load up the eight, then blast it
See which one gon' run the fastest!

Talking like I don't do shit, nigga

Slide up, fire at like six niggas
And I'mma be back if I miss, nigga
Wait, hold on
Pleading Voice: "Man, I went to school with that nigga, I was cool with that nigga. I know that, man. On the bus I know that nigga, an-"
Pappy: "Get the fuck on"
Better get off my dick, that's yo hoe job
Drug dealing, that's better than no job
No sex, I'll settle for a blowjob
Everybody gotta get a turn like a doorknob
You can catch me on the pole where it's cold, where you need about two-three coats and like four hats
On parole, say I can't hold no gats?

You hear me spit, you can tell I be extra serious
Cause I'mma be the realest motherfucker next to Big and Pac
Whether you believe it or not, hold on
Folks like, "Slow down, you be rapping to quick"
All my hoes doing dicks, all my bros doing bids
Niggas talk that, "They ain't on shit"
Be the main ones talking bout they ain't no bitch
House, just bought that, I ain't paying no rent
