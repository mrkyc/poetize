Alright, man
Two Cups Part Two coming soon or something
Motherfucker just dropped  Savages or something
Just finna' drop this Killa or something
Fuck Nigga coming soon or something
Got Shooters on deck with broski, right here or something
Coming soon or something
I'mma go and spaz how they done wanted me to spaz, though, cause I ain't spazzed in a minute
I'mma gon' 'head and go crazy, he like...


I done started from the bottom, now I'm here, nigga
Only fearing God, I don't fear niggas
Niggas talking out they ass but I don't hear niggas
When I'm sliding past, I might see you in my rear nigga
Cause that's where you supposed to be
I'm riding with my toast on me
Ain't got no friends, I  keep my enemies close to me
That's how it's supposed to be, bitches be approaching me like Ain't you Young Pappy? Remember you was smoking dope with me!
Hoes trying to mingle, start a little conversation to get me to take they number down, tell me when to come around
But shit, I don't fuck around
Cause hoes try to set me up
Have a nigga downstairs, call her tell her let me up
Nigga might slide through, see me, try to wet me up
Guns get to drawing like a artist try to tat' me up
But me I ain't going, cause my third eye be open
Tell that bitch she ain't shit and she laugh like I be joking
Pop a pill just to heal, I ain't talking ibuprofen
Sticky kush call it dope,  be fried, I be toasted
I be trying to do my thing, niggas hating, bitches love me
Say we got something going on, they see the way they bitches hug me
Niggas smile in my face, but in they eyes I see the hate
Try to walk up in my shoes, but yo' size is just a eight
I'm a grown ass man, nigga
You ask me, you's a grown ass man, get yo' grown ass beat
I be out here in these streets, riding strapped up with my heat
But when I see the police, my  be strapped up to the seat
Real gangsters move in silence, never talk to the police
Since I'm a real gangster, when they ask I never speak
Real niggas they abide by that, money by hoes I ride by that
Keep my hammer on me, on my homie I'mma die by that
Why I gotta' lie 'bout that? Niggas know and bitches know
Hoe say she don't like me, fuck you wanna' take my picture for?
He ain't gon' blow, don't know what he got a pistol for
Nigga kiss the dick, that bitch right under the mistletoe
Niggas be expecting  a reply when they be dissing though
So I'm not expecting you to cry when you be missing, somewhere tied up in my kitchen, nigga
Begging for some mercy
My niggas with that action, when it's cracking, they be thirsty
I be picky with my clothes, it's designer what I'm wearing
Never seen this in the stores, so when she look she get to staring
But I like that shit, I'm arrogant, I get that from my parents
But I told you, I don't walk the streets, I run 'em like it's errands
I be feeling like I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover, all them
'Till she got mad, I understand, shorty call him
Shit be fucked up, I be wishing I can call Tim
Ball so hard, they can't find us, they be like "bro, this y'all gym!"
Niggas they be giving up, bitches they gon' give it up
Dope man, take twenty bands, I'll stick him up
You will get changed for some change, I don't give a fuck
They don't know who shot like 'Pac when I hit 'em up
Pop, pop! Body drop, cops gotta' zip him up
Another body drop, so the opps get to clicking up
Niggas know I'm hot, so hot I'll sizzle up
One shot to the toughest nigga, you'll shrivel up
Back like I never left, better than I ever been
Bitch, got her super ready, wetter than she ever been
Took her to the top floor, she say she ain't never been
Got her where I want her, all I gotta' do is tell her when
'Bout ready to shine now, watch say my time, now!
Say that shit before but I ain't never write that line down
Freestyle -ing, niggas still playing that
