I just dropped 2 Cups Part 1
And two days passed, now I'm finna drop 2 Cups Part 2
(2 Cups)

But that's still not enough, shorty
Try me if you tough, shorty
I ain't gotta bust, I'll pay a husk to get you touched, shorty
My shorties be thirsty 'cause they know I did too much, shorty
They shoot for 2 Cups and they ain't even know 2 Cups, shorty
You can ask my pops, I ain't never gave a fuck, shorty
Silence on my Glock, a few shots, bet you hush, shorty
Face shots say, "Fuck a casket!"
Cremate 'em, dust, shorty
Pockets full of dead presidents like Mount Rush, shorty
I ain't never ever in my life been for none, shorty
We grew up with knives and had fights for our fun, shorty
Taught tote pipes, we see lights and we run, shorty
My kids on her tongue, she like: "We might have a son, shorty"
I'm like: "Is you dumb, shorty? Don't you know my name, shorty?"
They say I'm a menace to society like Caine, shorty
I need everything, shorty
You look like a stain, shorty
Fuck easing the pain, I catch a opp, I might hang shorty
They let me off papers, shorty
I swear I couldn't take it, shorty
They like, "You go crazy, Young Pap, your lil' ass gon' make it, shorty!"
I asked for some sloppy top, I don't see why you naked, shorty
Can I get some top or nah? I don't have time to cake it, shorty
They like: "Who your competition?"
Don't know what that is, shorty
You can ask my opposition, they know what we did, shorty
Mosey roll up that Munchie 'cause we don't smoke no mid, shorty
This shit called "Death," and I talkin' 'bout your ears, shorty
I don't do no dance, got this .40 in my pants, shorty
Purple got me slurring, they like: "I can't understand shorty!"
It's 2015, fuck I look like throwin' hands, shorty?
You must think I'm playin', so you better get your mans, shorty
I'm all white like Mensa, shorty
She all white like Mensa, shorty
We all white like Mensa, this for you 2 Cups, we miss you, shorty!
Say that ain't your bitch, but she with me, you make it a issue, shorty
Nigga, you main ain't on shit
