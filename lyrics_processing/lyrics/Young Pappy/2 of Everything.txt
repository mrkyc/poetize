Wait, pour me up two times for 2 Cups
A deuce in the liter, two eights of Kush got me too stuck
Ever since Pooh Bear died, I ain't give two fucks
About no nigga, I treat niggas like I'm Ku Klux
Wait, pour me up two times for 2 Cups
A deuce in the liter, two eights of Kush got me too stuck
Ever since Pooh Bear died, I ain't give two fucks
About no nigga, I treat niggas like I'm Ku Klux

Wait, pour me up two times for 2 Cups
A deuce in the liter, two eights of Kush got me too stuck
Ever since Pooh Bear died, I ain't give two fucks
About no nigga, I treat niggas like I'm Ku Klux
That mean I don't hang with 'em
Nah, I don't bang with 'em
It been the same ten year niggas that done changed, nigga
Swear I stay the same through all the pain and this rain, nigga
Blow out his brains, I see everything he think, nigga

Wait, wait
Slow me up, I ain't with that bullshit
Pour me up another time, now I'm on that bullshit
They say I turned savaged, I used to be on some cool shit
They must got confused with the niggas I was cool with
True shit, I kept shit a hundred since I been a youngin'
I'm used to having nothin', that's why I do all this stuntin'
Niggas I beef with, they don't tweak 'cause they know how I'm coming
Keep it on me, he run up on me, must be high off something
I don't know what niggas be thinkin'
But I know niggas be tweakin'
Keep your eyes open, limit your blinkin'
She thirsty to have my kids, so I'm gon' let her swallow my semen
I'll never refuse them County calls no matter what time my shit ring
'Cause I know how that shit feel
Fake niggas gon' say they real
Real niggas gon' play they role
Broke niggas can't pay they bills
I wish niggas stop all this block poppin', but I guess that's the way they drill
Two cups, two blunts, two bottles poppin' the only way my pain gon' heal
See I know how that shit feel
Fake niggas gon' say they real
Real niggas gon' play they role
Broke niggas can't pay they bills
I wish niggas stop all this block poppin', but I guess that's the way they drill
Two cups, two blunts, two bottles poppin' the only way my pain gon' heal

Slide through the opps shit in a steamer van
If we see a opp, slide doors
Five niggas hop out with eight or nine poles
Send like 89 shots, fuck like 85 hoes
I'm a muh'fuckin' demon
OTE be the team and
We do too much for no reason
Be sippin' on lean, so I'm leanin' off all of these drugs
You take all of these slugs if you tweakin'
All of them shots
Lil' nigga, don't leave off this block until you get off all of them rocks
Unless you make it for them blocks
And I be with them 50 niggas
They know 50 got all the lil' thots
They like: "Damn, we can't take y'all!"
Catch us at the club, we gon' spray y'all
Better ask the opps about Shay, dog
Cannon how we do y'all
Move shit around like a U-Haul
Better ask the opps about Q-Ball 'fore you get your shit blew off
I be with a whole lot of shooters
I be with a whole lot of killers
Got a whole lot of Rugers
Smokin' on a whole bunch of Munchie
Flexing on the hoes, countin' money
Hoes say I'm acting funny
Everybody know I keep a ratchet
Two Glock .40's with a TEC
And I'm in love with the Act
And I just hollered at the plug, better patch it
Give a fuck if he taxing, I'ma make the shit back, man
Wait, pour me up two times for 2 Cups
A deuce in the liter, two eights of Kush got me too stuck
