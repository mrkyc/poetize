Creeping, throbbing
Saunter from corner to wall
Trying to part the whispers from shouting and calls
This will is itching
This want is making me soar
What is expected, to seem a happy whore?

Come on, just kill this
Demands and notions
All this commotion is not worth it
Come on, just give this
A second coming
An age is dawning with all smiles and laughter

Come on, just kill this
Demands and notions
All this commotion is not worth it
Come on, just give this
A second coming
An age is dawning with all smiles and laughter

One foot forward
Will you be catching my fall?
Once I give I know you'll be claiming more (from me)
And you've had me scratching
You have been talking me sore
(Come on, just kill this, come on)
What is expected, to carry you in my arms?
(Come on, just kill this, come on)
You might also like
Come on, just kill this
Demands and notions
All this commotion is not worth it
Come on, just give this
A second coming
An age is dawning with all smiles and laughter

Come on, just kill this
(Come on, just kill this)
Demands and notions
(Come on, just kill this)
All this commotion is not worth it
(Come on, just kill this)
Come on, just give this
(Come on, just kill this)
A second coming
(Come on, just kill this)
An age is dawning with all smiles and laughter
(Come on, just kill this)

Come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this
Come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this
Come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this
Come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this
(And laughter)
Come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this
Come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this, come on, just kill this
(And laughter)
Come on, just kill this
(Come on, just kill this)
Demands and notions
(Come on, just kill this)
All this commotion is not worth it
(Come on, just kill this, not worth it)
Come on, just give this
(Come on, just kill this)
A second coming
(Come on, just kill this)
An age is dawning with all smiles and laughter
(Come on, just kill this)
