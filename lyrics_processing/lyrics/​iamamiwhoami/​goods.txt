I come bearing legacy
That we caused jointly in our dawning land
I come with delivery
And I have wrapped it in my mourning band

I bring you my history
That I expect your tender arms around
Give it love and think of me
These are the letters from our compound

We see the dawning of novelty
(Dawning of novelty)
Where we embrace the grand of subtlety
(Embrace the, the subtlety)
Time finally caught up with me
(Finally caught up with me)
A mouldering image of a fleeing fugitive
(Fleeing fugitive)

Toned down but playful
You say your greetings with goodbyes
Your cup is brim full
Sorrow stricken with a smile
You might also like
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given
To the searchers who explore
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given
To the searchers who explore

Don't expect to hear from me
Cause I have got to feed our hungry mouths
I do enjoy your company
But we must work to keep you content

I see the better and worse in me
(Better and the worse in me)
I embrace the grand of subtlety
(Embrace the, the subtlety)
But you finally caught up with me
(Finally caught up with me)
A mouldering image of a fleeing fugitive
(Fleeing fugitive)
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given
To the searchers who explore
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given
To the searchers who explore
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given
To the searchers who explore
Now we found the cure
Returning to the shore
Change is always given
To the searchers who explore


Toned down but playful
You say your greetings with goodbyes
Your cup is brim full
