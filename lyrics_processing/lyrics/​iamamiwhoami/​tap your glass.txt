Tap your glass, let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass and give it my all?
We could tap our glasses, let ourselves go now

Tap my glass, raise my voice to call upon your attention
As it fills to the verge
When full, it breaks and floods all suspension
Draw a breath and let ourselves go
Through the dark veil, we slowly float
I feel the salt slowly fill your throat

Tap your glass, let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass and give it my all?
We could tap our glasses, let ourselves go now
Tap your glass, let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass and give it my all?
We could tap our glasses, let ourselves go now

From the tide that's rising
Using all of my force
I form shapes of the sea
You're changing its course
We are creating new islands
Now will the flood come swallow down all our sorrow
Down and down, we drown, we drown
We drown here
You might also like
Let the shallows of above forget us
Getting closer to the bottom
The venture of a life in the cold never to be forgotten
Unless they want to let themselves go
Unless they choose to be swallowed
Then the above will be visible

Tap your glass, let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass and give it my all?
We could tap our glasses, let ourselves go now
Tap your glass, let us see you unfold
Shall I tap my glass and give it my all?
We could tap our glasses, let ourselves go now

From the tide that's rising
Using all of my force
I form shapes of the sea
You're changing its course
We are creating new islands
Now will the flood come swallow down all our sorrow
Down and down, we drown, we drown
We drown here
We are creating new islands
The tide is rising
