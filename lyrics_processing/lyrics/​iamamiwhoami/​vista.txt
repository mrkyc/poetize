Want, want, want, want
(Own, use)
Want, want, want, want
(Own, use)
Want, want, want, want
(Own, use)
Want, want, want, want
(Own, use)

Stretching out before my eyes
All riches a ruler requires
Regal shimmer, blinding shine
All hollowness when all this is mine

Through all the shallow depths, I had to wade
This could've become my darkest hour
Enough of days of living in the shade

My icy heart will turn to gold
Gazing underneath the tidy sky
Claim my land of frozen soil
Rest my eyes on this grand view, making it mine
You might also like
Can you follow me, never to be found?
(Want, use, take it)
Tasting salty in the great blue, we will shine
(I want you to take it)

Improbable place unknown
Untouched and undestroyed
Here I let my armies grow
Our voices will loudly crow

Whoever needed identity to reign
Make them believe to cure their drought
I want the world rushing through my veins

My icy heart will turn to gold
Gazing underneath the tidy sky
Claim my land of frozen soil
Rest my eyes on this grand view, making it mine

Can you follow me, never to be found?
(Want, you to take it all, take it)
Tasting salty in the great blue, we will shine
(Shine)
Want you to take me all
(Want, want, want, want
Want, want, want, want
Want, want, want, want
Want, want, want, want)
I want you to take me all

Can you follow me through the second round?
Can you taste the pale white salt against your tongue?

My icy heart will turn to gold
Gazing underneath the tidy sky
Claim my land of frozen soil
Rest my eyes on this grand view, making it mine

Can you follow me, never to be found?
(Want you to take it all, take it)
Tasting salty in the great blue, we will shine
