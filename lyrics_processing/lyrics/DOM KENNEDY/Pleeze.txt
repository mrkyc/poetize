And we hang on the corner like a lamp post
My favorite singer Mr. Vandross
Dean wanna search through my JanSport
"Dom, take this rent up to the landlord"
'95 Windsor Hills city champ
Hit Orville Wright, got my city stamped
The 439 was my city van
Nigga hella cool, but don't get him amped
Shit, we try to live the best of it
So take what you need and leave the rest of it
Write your goals down, what you expect from it?
Baby on the way, keep them checks comin'
Streets real hard, but the test wasn't
Should've went to class with the rest of 'em
But fuck it, now my name with the best of 'em
Woo, he 19 in the Lex, thuggin'
Made a right turn on my old street
Niggas outside, chillin' lowkey
It's 12:47, Mr. Police
Fuckin' helicopters, get no sleep
Pillow on my head tryna drown it out
You can call me when you down and out
When the cops come and surround the house
Crenshaw niggas run the town, I'm out

Dead end in the J's off of August St
Pops drove a turquoise 280 Z
Playing Tracy Chapman, we was watching Heat
Shoot out in the alley make it hard to sleep
59th & 5th at my Granny house
Uncle Reggie spillin' Schultz on my Granny couch
The lesson was never go the addict route
To deal with mines? I probably pull the automatic out
60th & 10th, cable with the chip
12 gauge behind the door, plastic where you sit
I told them I would do it, talked a lot of shit
Came back home after all the trips
Pillow on they head tryna drown it out
You can still call me if you down and out
When the cops come and surround the house
Crenshaw niggas run the town, I'm out
Please make it home safe
Please make it home safe
Please make it home safe
Just make it home safe
Yup
Yup
