Break me up or chop me down
Say you comin over in a half an hour
So tell me how you wanna feel
Cause if the answer good I can do that for ya

So come roll me up and smoke it away
You keep saying I'm a drug, numb in the bed
Take it awa-a-a-a-a-ay
Come roll me up, and smoke it awa-a-ay

This pain got me feeling like I need it
This pain got me feeling like a fiend
This pain got me looking like I need it
This pain got me
I can be your sponsor
I could tell you not to do it if I didn't lead you to it
But I'm tripping all kinds of ways
And all I wanna do is get another hit of you

Yo
Seduction is beautiful
But don't lead me on cause I play along if the feeling is mutual
We both feel the same
If life is forever, there was no beginning, there won't be no funeral
Circle of life
Your love is a drug, I gotta admit I'm addicted to using you
I need me a fix
And I know you been craving me too
Working all week and you been sicker than usual wearing the coolest disguise
But I see right through it right down to the blueprint I am in tune with your mind
With your mind
I know what you life, before you even told me your name, I figured your sign
With all of that fire and all of that passion girl you ain't even pulling the blind
So what do you see?
Is it pain is it pleasure?
None of those things you can measure
Leave your insecurities at the door, leave your inhibitions on my dresser
Leave your dress right down there on the floor
Taking you places you ain't been to ever
I got you I got you open tonight
You gambling baby you all in my dice
I'm like a sensual criminal stealing your breath
Stealing your breath
Body to body
Covered in sweat, grabbing your hair and your neck
Remember this night, it's not one to regret
It's not one to regret
When the party is over, you craving the smoker
And you don't even smoke cigarettes
