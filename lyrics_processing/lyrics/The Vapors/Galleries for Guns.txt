Well maybe it's the time of year, or maybe the calm before the storm
Oh we missed some show on the bbc
And we all gave up except for you and me
We sit here playing with snakes on a board
Talking about holidays over the wall
With the moonligth playing games around your eyes
You look like ice and almost hypnotised
But there ain't no rules to keep us apart
Just one for the head and one for the heart
Of the target man, target man, target man, target man
Aim at me
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it
This is all I need
'cos I say, galleries for guns
Seem like no exchange at all
But I can give you armour if you keep me warm
People can be awful slow, or maybe they just don't want to know
But I'll stay with you if you'll stay with me
And I'll give you all that you'll ever need
Those butterfly boys may look very neat
But they never stay long and they never stay sweet
The moonlight's playing games around your eyes
You look like ice and almost hypnotised
But there ain't no rules to keep us apart
Just one for the head and one for the heart
Of the target man, target man, target man, target man
Aim at me
You might also likeThis is it, this is it, this is it, this is it
This is all I need
'cos I say, galleries for guns
Seem like no exchange at all
But I can give you armour if you keep me warm
How you gonna keep me warm
How you gonna keep me warm
How you gonna keep me warm
Now that the whole world's chloroformed
Oh we missed some show on the bbc
And we all gave up except for you and me
We sit here playing with snakes on a board
Talking about holidays over the wall
With the moonligth playing games around your eyes
You look like ice and almost hypnotised
But there ain't no rules to keep us apart
Just one for the head and one for the heart
Of the target man, target man, target man, target man
Aim at me
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it
This is all I need
'cos I say, galleries for guns
Seem like no exchange at all
