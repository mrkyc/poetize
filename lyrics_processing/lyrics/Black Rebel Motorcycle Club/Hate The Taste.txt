I got a fatal heart, I'm tied to the living
Got a tortured soul, I can't give it away
Gonna find a line, to get me through to reason
Gonna bury it all, just to give it a name

I hate the taste, but I carry on believing
Yeah I hate the taste, but I do it again
I hate the taste, but I carry on believing
Yeah I hate the taste, but I do it all again

I'd say I told you so, but I know you never listen
You're the only one I ever cared to show
There's a fine line between fool and heartache
It's the faded signs that make heart ached fools

I hate the taste, but I carry on believing
Yeah I hate the taste, but I do it again
I hate the taste, but I carry on believing
Yeah I hate the taste, but I do it all again

I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
Why won't you take me there?
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
Why won't you take me there?

I got a traitor's heart, I'm tired of the living
With a tattered soul I got no one to blame
Gonna fall apart if I leave it to decision
She's the only one could ever take it away

I hate the taste, but I carry on believing
Yeah I hate the taste, but I do it again
I hate the taste, but I carry on believing
Yeah I hate the taste, but I do it all again

I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
Why won't you take me there?
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
Why won't you take me there?

I'm a mess, I'm a mess
Wanna dance with the wretched
I'm as sick as it gets
I need to tell ya
I'm a mess, I'm a mess
Wanna dance with the wretched
I'm as sick as it gets
I need to tell ya I'm a mess
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
Why won't you take me there?
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you
Why won't you take me there?

I wanna ride with you (I'm a mess, I'm a mess)
I wanna ride with you (Wanna dance with the wretched)
I wanna ride with you (I'm as sick as it gets
