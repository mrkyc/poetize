Here's to the babies in a brand new world
Here's to the beauty of the stars
Here's to the travelers on the open road
Here's to the dreamers in the bars
Here's to the teachers in the crowded rooms
Here's to the workers in the field
Here's to the preachers of the sacred word
Here's to the drivers at the wheel

Here's to you, my little love
Let the day begin
Here's to you, my love, with blessings from above
Let the day begin

Here's to the winners of the human race
Here's to the losers in the game
Here's to the soldiers of the bitter war
Here's to the wall that bears their names

Here's to you, my little love
Let the day begin
Here's to you, my love, with blessings from above
Let the day begin, day begin, day start

Here's to the doctors and their healing work
Here's to the loved ones in their care
Here's to the strangers on the streets tonight
Here's to the lonely everywhere
Here's to the wisdom from the mouths of babes
Here's to the lions in their cage
Here's to the struggles of the silent poor
Here's to the closing of an age

Here's to you, my little love (Here's to you, my little love)
Let the day begin
Here's to you, my little love (Here's to you, my little love)
Let the day begin
Here's to you, my little love (Here's to you, my little love)
Let the day begin
Here's to you, my little love, with blessings from above (Here's to you, my little love)
(Let the day begin)
Here's to you, my little love, with blessings from above (Here's to you, my little love)
(Let the day begin)
Here's to you, my little love, with blessings from above (Here's to you, my little love)
