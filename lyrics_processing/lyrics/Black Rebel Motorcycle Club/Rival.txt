My eyes on survival
I'm living with the lost
And we're living in denial
It begs to question
Who's gonna carry on
If no one's awake
Then there's no one who can play along
I need a rival
I need a rival
I'm tired of the fools who are killing for survival
I need a rival
I need a rival
I found my soul, let's set it on fire
I'm not the righteous
I'm not the innocent
I'm just a sign it's all gone wrong
We're not the righteous
We're not the innocent
We're just a sign it's all wrong
I got the message
There's no one available
I seen it all before
And I'm fine if you say so
I go to places
No one should ever go
I'm living like I knew
What the hell i was looking for
You might also likeI need a rival
I need a rival
I'm tired of the fools who are killing for survival
I need a rival
I need a rival
I found my soul, let's set it on fire
My soul's on fire
I live in superstition
I'm a fool on fire
I carry on the fight
My soul's on fire
I live in superstition
I'm a fool on fire
I carry on the fight
My soul's on fire
I live in superstition
I'm a fool on fire
I carry on the fight
My soul's on fire
I live in superstition
I'm a fool on fire
I carry on the fight
We're not the righteous
We're not the innocent
We're just a sign it's all wrong
I'm not the righteous
I'm not the innocent
I'm just a sign it's all gone wrong
I need a rival

I'm tired of the fools who are killing for survival
I need a rival
