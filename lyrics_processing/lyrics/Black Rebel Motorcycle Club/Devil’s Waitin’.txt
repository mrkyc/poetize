10,000 or more with hearts on their own
They say I might die and I maybe cold
I may have no Jesus, I may have no soul
In prison, I hear there's time to be good
But the first thing you see is the last thing you should

Well, I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life laying here is the life I've been told
Yeah, I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life I have here is the life I've been sold
They say there's a path soon where I'll stand to judge
But the devil's a waiting with Christ like a son
When the look comes your way, best say was I
For the reasons you hold, give reasons to die
The calling's impatient when calls never won
But the last one to say it may last through the flood
Well, I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life laying here is the life I've been sold
Yeah, I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life I have here is the life I've been told
I'm born and weary but life's just begun
And I've run from the reasons and roamed to the gun
They say I'm the killer and thy will be done
And the doors won't be open when I finally become

And the life out here is the life I've been sold
Yeah, I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life laying here is the life I've been told
We're fallin' fast but we've no cares
We know our Lord's gonna meet us there
We pray our Lord's gonna meet us there
We know our Lord's gonna meet us there
We're fallin' fast but we've no care
We know our Lord's gonna meet us there
