You can't move, can't get right
Alone in the dark in the middle of the night
You're hangin' on but just barely
Burned out, faded away
Tryna see the sun while you're standin' in the way
Your heart's been runnin' on empty

So if you feel lost, walkin' a wire
Gon' put 'em up, burn a little brighter
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
We just wanna take it higher
But we need a spark if we're gonna start a fire
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters

Ain't about what you do, no matter where you go
We all see highs, we all see lows
And life's just mountains and valleys
Illuminate, shine from inside
Give a little love, get it back in time
Cause you got a light that's amazing
You might also like
So if you feel lost, walkin' a wire
Gon' put 'em up, burn a little brighter
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
We just wanna take it higher
But we need a spark if we're gonna start a fire
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters

Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Let me see your light, let me see your light shine
Let me see your light

If you feel lost, walkin' a wire
Gon' put 'em up, burn a little brighter
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
We just wanna take it higher
But we need a spark if we're gonna start a fire
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
Let me see your lighter, let me see your lighters
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up
Get 'em up, hey, get 'em up, gon' get 'em up

You can't move, can't get right
Alone in the dark in the middle of the night
