She never had a lot of love but the summertime love
Summer flames never turned into anything much
We met on an August night at a lake house of a buddy of mind
The first kiss didn't miss but it wasn't enough
And I said

Yeah, the days are still long
The water's still warm, baby
There's still something in the air tonight

Got a whole lot of time left
There's still so many sunsets
To make a night that we won't forget, baby
Ain't runnin' outta summer yet
There's still chances to take
And night swimming in a lake
We'll all asleep on the back deck, baby
We ain't runnin' outta summer yet
Yeah, let's make a night that we'll never forget, baby
We can still find love
We ain't runnin' outta summer yet

I can't believe that the summertime's almost gone
And boys seem a little bit sweeter in the summertime sun
Lake house of a friend of a friend
I wasn't tryna fall in love again
But the first kiss didn't miss and it wasn't enough
And he said
