We met in the dark in the bonfire sparks
In the summertime stars
Said I wanna get to know you
Seems like you'd be someone like me
Now that I'm free I wanna get to know you
We can take it slow
Just find out where it goes, this summer
Oh, you know I wanna

Get lost in the moon light
Sweet talk til the sun rise
Find out if it feels right
Hey, I wanna get to know you
Tell me all about your hometown
Wanna hear how it all went down
Things that made you who you are now
Hey, I wanna get to know you
Hey, I wanna get to know you

Show me your scars, the breaks in your heart
Let down your guard, I wanna get to know you
Live these lessons that I've learned baby
I got burned last summer, oh but now I wanna
You might also like
Get lost in the moon light
Sweet talk til the sun rise
Find out if it feels right
Hey, I wanna get to know you
Tell me all about your hometown
Wanna hear how it all went down
Things that made you who you are now
Hey, I wanna get to know you
Hey, I wanna get to know you

I wanna sunrise sweet talk at the end of the moon light walk
We walk together, I wanna get to know you better
Sunrise sweet talk at the end of the moon light walk
Can we walk together, I wanna get to know you better

Get lost in the moon light
Sweet talk til the sun rise
Find out if it feels right
Hey, I wanna get to know you
Tell me all about your hometown
Wanna hear how it all went down
Things that made you who you are now
Hey, I wanna get to know you
Hey, I wanna get to know you
We met in the dark, in the bonfire sparks
In the summer time stars
