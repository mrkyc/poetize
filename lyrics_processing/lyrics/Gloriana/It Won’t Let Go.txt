Sittin' on the floor of my bedroom cryin'
Tears like rain on rooftops
Scars on my heart from the war I've been fightin'
And I pray like hell but the pain won't stop

When you know that the boy you love keeps lettin' you down
When the boy you love is killin' you right now
When the boy you love keeps runnin' around
You got two eyes, but you don't see
And you ain't blind, but you won't leave him

I've tried to walk away
I've tried to leave him before
Threw it all in an old suitcase
Got as far as the front door
No it ain't no perfect love
It's all that I've ever known
My heart's still holdin' on tight
So tight that it won't let go
It won't let go
My heart's still holdin' on tight, and it won't let go

A small town girl, small town options
Like another camp song on the radio
Your heart skipped a beat and the beat hadn't stopped
But this ain't Jack and Dianne, gotta let him go
Y'all ain't Jack and Dianne, gotta let him go
You might also like
I've tried to walk away
I've tried to leave him before
Threw it all in an old suitcase
Got as far as the front door
No it ain't no perfect love
It's all that I've ever known
My heart's still holdin' on tight
So tight that it won't let go
It won't let go
My heart's still holdin' on tight, and it won't let go
Go, it won't let go
My heart's still holdin' on tight, and it won't let go

And you know that the boy you love keeps lettin' you down
And the boy you love is killin' you right now
And the boy you love keeps runnin' around
I've tried to walk away
I've tried to leave him before
Got as far as the front door

I've tried to walk away
I've tried to leave him before
Threw it all in an old suitcase
Got as far as the front door
No it ain't no perfect love
It's all that I've ever known
My heart's still holdin' on tight
So tight that it won't let go
It won't let go
