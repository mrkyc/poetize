She walked up, said she needed a drink
I said whatcha want, she said, whatcha think?
I took a sip and we were slipping away
To a little corner table to the left of the stage
It was just some random night in July
No, there wasn't no fireworks up in the sky
Thought it was nothing, we were just having fun
Next thing you know

(Three, two, one) We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up, couldn't stop it (Woah, woah)
When she talked, I just wanted to listen
Just like that we were kissin'
Whenever I get to reminiscin'
I think about how it started out
As a what's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' bout whatever, ended up being the best night ever

We were there, till they closed down the bar
Then we spent a couple hours leaning up on your car
Watched the stars fade out, my head on your shoulder
Saying baby, please don't let it be over
I've been everywhere all over this town, tryin' to recreate it
But I never found, whatever it was, whatever we had
No nothing no, nothing's gonna ever top that

We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up, couldn't stop it (Woah, woah)
When she talked, I just wanted a little listen
Just like that we were kissin'
Whenever I get to reminiscin'
I think about how it started out
As a what's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' bout whatever, ended up being the best night ever

Wasn't even trying to fall in love
But just like that, 3-2-1

We shook the world like a rocket
Dancing with my hands in her pocket
Sun coming up couldn't stop it (Woah, woah)
When she talked, I just wanted a little listen
Just like that we were kissin'
Whenever I get to reminiscin'
I think about how it started out
As a what's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' bout whatever, ended up being
The best night
What's up, catch a buzz
Talkin' 'bout whatever, ended up being
The best night ever
(Woah) best night ever
Woah, woah
