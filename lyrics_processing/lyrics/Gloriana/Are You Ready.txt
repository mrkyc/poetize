Girl, I've been watching you sipping
And peeling that blue label off of your bottle
Looking like you wanna leave here with me
Got my keys we can roll if you wanna

Boy, what you got?
Go on, take a shot
Best make it hot (Whoa)
Let's disappear
Knock back your beer
Get me out of here

Are you ready for a long night?
Are you ready for a good time?
Oh, there's a bonfire burning on the wayback 40
And they're breaking out the moonshine
Are you ready for a low ride?
Gonna take it to the flip side
We'll seal that deal with a sunrise whiskey kiss
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this?

Boy, I've been waiting for so long for someone
That might match me crazy for crazy
Someone who knows how to take what they want
Not somebody who might try and save me
You might also like
Boy, what you got?
Go on, take a shot
Best make it hot (Whoa)
Let's disappear
Knock back your beer
Get me out of here

Are you ready for a long night?
Are you ready for a good time?
Oh, there's a bonfire burning on the wayback 40
And they're breaking out the moonshine
Are you ready for a low ride?
Gonna take it to the flip side
We'll seal that deal with a sunrise whiskey kiss
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this?

Sometimes this town feels so dead
It feels like I'm dying
Well, you know we can't live forever
We can die trying
Boy, what you got?
Go on, take a shot
Best make it hot
Are you ready for a long night?
Are you ready for a good time?
Oh, there's a bonfire burning on the wayback 40
And they're breaking out the moonshine
Are you ready for a low ride?
Gonna take it to the flip side
We'll seal that deal with a sunrise whiskey kiss
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready for a long night?
Are you ready for a good time?
