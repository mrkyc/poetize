Take me out to where the fields don't end
Where I belong, where me and my friends
Are holding it down, standing our ground

Friday night
Ain't no way I'm gonna miss that blue moon rising
Ain't nobody gonna drag me down
Spinning tires burning fast
Sun settin' on a dust cloud highway
Spark that fuse and let's blow this town
Just over that hill, there's a good time waiting
Come on, come on, come on, baby

Take me out where the fields don't end
Where I belong, where me and my friends
Are holding it down, standing our ground
We live life just a little too loud
A little too tough, a little too proud
Holding it down 'til the end of our days
We're doin' it our way

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Way out here, ain't no rules
Get loose, get a little bit crazy
Ain't no way that they're stopping us, baby
Grab my hand, it's our song
We can dance in the headlights, maybe
Make a little love 'til the sun comes up
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be amazing
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby

Take me out where the fields don't end
Where I belong, where me and my friends
Are holding it down, standing our ground
We live life just a little too loud
A little too tough, a little too proud
Holding it down 'til the end of our days
We're doin' it our way

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Just over the hill, there's a good time waiting (Good time waiting)
Girl, it's gonna get wild, it's gonna be amazing
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Take me out where the fields don't end
Where I belong, where me and my friends
Are holding it down, standing our ground
We live life just a little too loud
A little too tough, a little too proud
Holding it down 'til the end of our days
We're doin' it our way

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Yeah, we're doin' it our way
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Yeah, we're doin' it our way
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
