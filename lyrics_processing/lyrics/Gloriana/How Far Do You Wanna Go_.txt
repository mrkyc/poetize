Well, I bumped in to your best friend
Said your talking
And thinking of leaving
Everything you've ever known

How far do you wanna go?

Spent the summer months
Saving just enough
Working fast food drive through
For that old fastback fixer up

How far do you wanna go?

Are you looking for a little more
Than this hold-you-down broken town?
Better leave now or you'll never know

How far do you wanna go?
You might also like
I can be the one, you can be mine too
We can run away, disappear
Get the hell out of here

Tell me you'll come with me
Tell me you'll run with me
Tell me you love me
How far do you wanna go?

There's an open sky staring back at us
And it's daring us to tear it up
Bury that town in a cloud of dust
How far do you wanna go?

Are you looking for a little more
Than this hold-you-down broken town?
Better leave now or you'll never know

How far do you wanna go?

I can be the one you can be mine too
We can run away, disappear
Get the hell out of here
Tell me you'll come with me
Tell me you'll run with me
Tell me you love me
How far do you wanna go?

Bigger dreams came from smaller things, baby
Yeah, maybe we are a little crazy
But I see that look in your eye
And I can tell you're ready to roll
I just need to know
How far do you wanna go?

Are you looking for a little more
Than this hold-you-down broken town?
Better leave now or you'll never know

How far do you wanna go?

I can be the one you can be mine too
We can run away, disappear
Get the hell out of here
Tell me you'll come with me
Tell me you'll run with me
Tell me you love me
