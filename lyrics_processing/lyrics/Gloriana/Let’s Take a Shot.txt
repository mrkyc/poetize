Girl, you've got my heartbeat beatin' right through my t-shirt
Yeah the way you're lookin' at me
I see you dancin' with your drink in your hand
Rockin' with the band
Yeah, thinkin' what's it gonna be now baby
Wanna get crazy, we can stay out all night or maybe
We can get gone so we can be alone, tell me what you want
(Come on, come on)

Yeah, let's take a shot
It don't matter if it's love or not
Yeah, let's give it all we've got
Baby don't stop (Come on, come on)
Yeah, you know you wanna kiss me
It's getting hotter than Fireball whiskey
Yeah ready or not (Come on, come on)
Let's take a shot, yeah
Let's take a shot
Take a shot, oh baby

Boy, I see that smile from across the bar
Lightin' that spark
Come on over to me lookin' like you wanna roll the dice
Don't think twice, tell me what's it gonna be
Now baby, wanna get crazy
We can stay out all night or maybe
We can get gone so we can be alone
Tell me what you want
(Come on, come on)
