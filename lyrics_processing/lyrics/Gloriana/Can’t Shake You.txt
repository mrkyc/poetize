I still change the station
Every time they play that song
Can't drive past your house
So I take the long way home
Your black leather jacket
Still hangin' in my closet
I wish that I could give it away
Oh, even though you're gone, somehow you stay

And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

I didn't wanna be here
But my friends all love this bar
I don't wanna see you
But I'm wondering where you are
And why am I still keepin'
The shirt you used to sleep in
It's been sittin' there for over a year
Oh, even though you left me, you're still here
You might also like
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

I can't shake you
No matter how hard I try
I can't shake you
I can't shake you
And I don't know why

And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
