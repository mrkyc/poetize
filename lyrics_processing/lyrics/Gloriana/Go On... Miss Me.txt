Back when I was seventeen
You were my high school dream
And boy, boy, I was stupid
First kiss in your pick-up truck
Thought I was the one you loved
And boy, boy, I was dumb
You played me, and baby
You did me oh so wrong
You were huggin' and squeezin'
Some other girl all night long

Whoa, one day, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna try and try to get me back again
Woah, no way you'll ever trick me
You'll never pull me in to fall for you again
'Cause your no good cheating heart will never win
So, go on... miss me

I heard you're not doing great
Still living out your parents place
And boy, boy, that's just stupid
All alone and I'm all grown up
Still driving that arista truck
And boy, boy, you're so dumb
You lost me, you're sorry
You got it all so wrong
Now you're hurtin' and cryin'
'Cause baby, I'm all gone
You might also like
Whoa, one day, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna try and try to get me back again
Whoa, no way you'll ever trick me
You'll never pull me in to fall for you again
'Cause your no good cheating heart will never win
So, go on... miss me

Leave messages on my phone
Sending flowers and writing love notes
Told you once, I'll say it again
Your no good cheatin' days are at an end

Whoa, one day, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna try and try to get me back again
Whoa, one day you're gonna miss me
You'll wanna be my man, win me back again
No, no, no way you'll ever trick me
You'll never pull me in to fall for you again
'Cause your no good cheating heart will never win
Your no good cheating days are at an end
So, go on... miss me
Go on... miss me
