I can be strong like a burning whiskey
I can be sweet like Tennessee honey, honey
Pretty as a daisy, careful if you pick me
This wildflower can get a little crazy, baby

If you're runnin' around, you better run from me
Pack up your bags and get gone, get gone
You wreck my heart, I'll wreck everything
And anything I can get my hands on
If you lie, lie, lie with those wandering eyes
Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
That you're gonna be... askin' for trouble

You got too many holes in your story
And I-I-I'll get down to the truth don't you worry, worry
Piece by piece I'll put it all together
And if you cross that line, you cross me forever, baby

If you're runnin' around, you better run from me
Pack up your bags and get gone, get gone
You wreck my heart, I'll wreck everything
And anything I can get my hands on
If you lie, lie, lie with those wandering eyes
Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
That you're gonna be...asking for trouble
You might also like
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh-oh
Trouble
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh

If you're runnin' around, you better run from me
Pack up your bags and get gone, get gone
If you wreck my heart, I'll wreck everything
And anything I can get my hands on
If you lie, lie, lie with those wandering eyes
Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
You best believe, hey, yeah
If you're foolin' around, you ain't foolin' me
Pack up your shit and get gone, get gone
You wreck my heart, I'll wreck everything
And anything I can get my hands on
Lie-lie-lie with who's wandering eyes
Better find one hell of a place to hide
If you mess with me, you best believe
That you're gonna be asking for trouble

Ooh, oh, ooh, oh-oh
