Ever since we took that midnight drive
Down to see the water in the full moon sky
And I told you I loved you on the blue creek road
Well, I was pullin' on forward for my Carolina Rose
Spent the next few years just singing my song
With Rose in the front row singing along
'Til I got that call, had to hit that road
Man, how am I gonna leave my Carolina Rose?

Yeah, the big time is everything I ever wanted
But the spotlight can't hold a candle to you
Standing up here on this stage
They all say, "Man, you got it made"
They don't know, it don't mean a thing without my Carolina Rose

Met a California girl on a west coast run
She sparkled like a diamond in the setting sun
They called me crazy when I let her go
I just couldn't stop thinking about my Carolina Rose

Yeah, the big time is everything I ever wanted
But the spotlight can't hold a candle to you
Standing up here on this stage
They all say, "Man, you got it made"
They don't know, it don't mean a thing without my Carolina Rose
You might also like
I've been halfway around the world
Just to come back to you
I hope I ain't too late
And I hope that you're still thinking about me too
So now I'm back here standing on your front porch
It's been five years, baby, but it feels like more
Well, let me drive you down that blue creek road
I got something to say to my Carolina Rose

Yeah, the big time is everything I ever wanted
But the spotlight can't hold a candle to you
Standin' up there on that stage
It might look like I got it made
But my heart knows, it don't mean a thing without my Carolina Rose

No, it don't mean a thing without my Carolina Rose
