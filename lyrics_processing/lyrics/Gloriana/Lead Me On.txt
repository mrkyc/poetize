There you go in all your beautiful glory
Messing with my head like you always did
I'm thinking things I don't wanna say
And I can't breathe
What do I have to tell you, girl
So you won't leave?

Tell me what I wanna hear
I don't care if you're lyin', baby
I just wanna feel you touch me right now
Go ahead and call it love
Tomorrow you can't deny it, baby
Kiss me again, let me pretend
That it's not wrong
Baby, lead me on

I wanna touch your skin, I wanna taste it
And I wanna feel that love like we used to make it
I don't care if we go nowhere
You're all I see
One more night with you is all I need
Yeah
You might also like
Tell me what I wanna hear
I don't care if you're lyin', baby
I just wanna feel you touch me right now
Go ahead and call it love
Tomorrow you can deny it, baby
Kiss me again, let me pretend
That it's not wrong
Baby, lead me on

I know what you want
I know what you need
I know when I'm gone
You'll still think of me
You know what I want
You know what I need
I know when you're gone
You won't even think about me

Tell me what I wanna hear
I don't care if you're lyin', baby
I just wanna feel you touch me right now
So go ahead and call it love
Tomorrow you can deny it, baby
Whisper my name, baby, no shame
Is it so wrong?
Baby, lead me on
I know what you want
I know what you need (Lead me on)
I know when I'm gone
You won't even think about me (Baby)
I know what you want
I know what you need
Oh, you know, you know, you know, know
You won't even think about me
I know what you want
I know what you need (Baby, lead me on)
