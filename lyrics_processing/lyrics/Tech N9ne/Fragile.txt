You said you'd never ever break
Down
But here I am sweeping
Pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play
To crowds
But I've seen you hoping
To play songs to them now
I've spent all night long
Scared of tomorrow, broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost
Pick it up slow before it's gone

We're fragile
(Wish I'da known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile
(You are not alone)
If it didn't break before, it's about to
(We been here before)
I don't ever wanna change
I'm fragile
I don't ever (No)

Some of the people appointed to give an opinion never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and die
N9na be givin' the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible
Get fanned away with grands to pay, this jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne, I'ma look very mean when a foe
Scribe a line, but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto'
'Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real, I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads, sizzling your ad?
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this (Understand this)
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes, I'm

Tell me that I'm famous, tell me that my name is
Big as Venus, Jupiter, and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favorite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin', abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as a Uzi
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm 'bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved, you shoulda known my music
We're fragile
(Wish I'da known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile
(You are not alone)
If it didn't break before, it's about to
(We been here before)
I don't ever wanna change
I'm fragile
