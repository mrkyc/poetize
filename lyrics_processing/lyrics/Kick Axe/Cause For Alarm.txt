Feelin' physically torn and mentally worn
And it's goin'
One too fast and other too slow
On the line
The scale sits level and it's in my favor
Through the hands of time
Through the hands of time the pain will be
Greater
Burnin'
There's a burnin' ambition that's deep inside me
I want it, it's a drive and a need that I just can't hide
Feel the whole earth shake, feel my body break
And I listen to the sirens weilling
Lights are flashin' red, ringing in my head
I can hear it getting louder, louder
There's a cause for alarm
There's a cause for alarm
Inflict the pain, inflict the pain upon myself
'Cause it fights the eye
Lights the eye of someone else
White noise, hearing white noise which I fear
As I lay awake, awake to the lullaby of ringing ears
Burnin'
Burnin' both ends just to fill the room
My blood runs
My blood runs out as I reopen old wounds

Explain mys fate to the ones I know
My body, my body's draining but my head won't slow
Wasted
Everyone's parted, they all go home
It's over
It's all over once again I'm alone
Burnin'
The smoke has cleared and the last scream strained
Tomorrow
Another day and I know I'll feel the pain
Feel the whole earth shake, feel my body break
And I listen to the sirens wailing
Lights are flashin' red, ringing in my head
I can hear it getting louder, louder
There's a cause for alarm
There's a cause for alarm
Feel the whole earth shake, feel my body break
And I listen to the sirens wailing
Lights are flashin' red, ringing in my head
I can hear it getting louder, louder
There's a cause for alarm
There's a cause for alarm
There's a cause for alarm
There's a cause for alarm
There's a cause for alarm
