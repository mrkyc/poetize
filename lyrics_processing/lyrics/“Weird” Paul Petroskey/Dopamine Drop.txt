I got a dopamine drop, it's my motivation
My preoccupation with gratification
Every day paying social media dues
Just for the sake of likes, comments, and views
Am I being exploited? It's hard to say
I hear that I'm loved almost every day
True--everybody be hyping
So I'm tapping, typing, scrolling and swiping
So tuned in, completely engrossed
With how many hearts I got on that post
In the search results I'm up on top

Dopamine, it's a neuromodulator
A mood escalator, that makes you feel greater
A feel-good hormone, made chemically
That gives you bliss, euphoria, ecstasy
Anticipating outcomes in social situations
Dopamine's released when you meet your expectations
And when these good interactions increase
It reinforces the behavior to make you repeat
And if you get these rewards in a group--
Bam! a dopamine feedback loop
Consequently, I don't want it to stop

On my youtube their eyes are glued
The multitude viewed and subscribers accrued
I'm not a quitter but over on my Twitter
I felt defeated so I tweeted and deleted
Scrap that, where's my other app at?
Oh Snapchat, I gotta tap that!
I got charisma, m'am
Nobody dissed me, man
Got props from my fam on my Instagram
My selfie on Facebook really summed it up
I got sixty-three loves and a hundred thumbs up
Man, i look great...no photoshop!
