Fearin' not growin' up (Growin')
Keepin' me up at night (At night)
Am I doin' enough? (Enough)
Feel like I'm wastin' time, oh, yeah

Promise to get a little better as I get older
And you're so patient, you're sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Should've, could've, probably wanna let me go
But you can't, oh

Right now, I feel it pourin', I need a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Right now, I feel it pourin', I need a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Please don't take, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do

Please, please
Don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
Darling, like I know you will, ooh

Forget to call your mama on the weekend
You should put yourself in time out
(Sh-sh-shame, sh-sh-shame on you)
But lately you've been feelin' so good
I forget my future, never pull out
(Sh-sh-shame, Sh-sh-shame on me)
Baby, the money'll make it easier for me
To run and hide out somewhere
(So far away)
Hoppin' through poppy fields
Dodgin' evil witches
These houses keep droppin' everywhere

Promise to get a little better as I get older
And you're so patient, you're sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Should've, could've, probably wanna let me go
But you can't, oh

Right now, I feel it pourin', I need a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Right now, it's really pourin', I need a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Please don't take, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take, take it personal (Please don't take it)
Like winter's fall on us, heavy
Take it off me, oh, it hurts
Rainin', I can't stand this
