Niggas want me to get ratchet
Niggas want me to attack it
Put the hood on, now they callin' me Cassius
Raunchy like Bob Saget
Greedy, I can't pass it
Eatin' everything, nigga, no fasting
I don't care how much you knew me in the past tense
I ain't no Julia Stiles, this ain't no last dance, way past it
Way
Fuckin' on my ex 'cause he validate me
Fuckin' up a check, I don't want no receipt
Might get possessed, let my spirit speak freely

Hey, my past can't escape me
My pussy precedes me
My, my, how the times change
I'm still playin' the victim
And you still playin' the pick-me

It's so embarrassing
All of the things I need living inside of me
I can't see it
It's so embarrassing
All of the love I seek living inside of me
I can't see, I'm blind

You ain't getting your bitch back
"Calm down, shit could be worse," never say that
I don't wanna pipe down, rather get payback
Mama told me never shit where you lay at
I don't want righteousness
I hurt too much, I lost too much, I lust too much
I hit my clutch and vroom
Third day, pop out the tomb
I love when you pull your gun at the red light
I like all that violence, give me dysfunction
I like when you come, never stay the whole night
Better when you high, never tell me I'm wrong

'Cause my past can't escape me
My pussy precedes me
My, my, how the times change
You still talking 'bout babies
And I'm still taking a Plan B
It's so embarrassing
All of the things I need living inside of me
I can't see it
It's so embarrassing
All of the love I seek living inside of me
I can't see, I'm blind

Blind, blind
Blind, blind
