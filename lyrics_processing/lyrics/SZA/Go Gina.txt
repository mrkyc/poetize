Hey, love
Yeah, I lost you, babe
Pickin' up a penny with a press-on is
Easier than holding you down
Can't be any harder than holding you up now
To come clean I said, to be real is (To come clean is to come clean)
To be real, it's
Probably true what they say about me
Probably came from my inner circle
It usually come from your inner circle
Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust
I've been droppin' out and
I've been hangin' out with my high friends
And we too stoned to pay attention now
(Much too cool for seventh grade)
I mean really, it's same me, it's old me
You know? Same shit
I've been on the low-key grinding
(Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding)
Learning on the low-key, shining
Tryin' to keep to myself
But you bring me out of character
Every time again

Damn, Gina, damn, Gina
Them jeans, they must be uptight, mama
You need some get right, mama
Go, Gina, go, Gina (Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go get that get right, mama (It works for me, it works for me, no)
Go, Gina, go, Gina (Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go 'til you get right, mama (It works for me, it works for me, no)

Still works for me, it works for me, no
