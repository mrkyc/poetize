You are but a phoenix among feathers
You're broken by the waves among the sea
They'll let you die, they'll let you wash away
But you swim as well as you fly

Pretty little bird, pretty little bird
You've hit the window a few times (The window a few times)
You're pretty little bird, pretty little bird
You still ain't scared of no heights
When the spiral down feels as good as the flight, oh
When hating you feels good for the night
When the morning comes, I hope you're still mine

When the morning comes
If the morning comes (I hope you're still mine)
When the morning comes
When the morning comes, I hope you're still mine (If the morning comes)
When the morning comes
If the morning comes

Told you I like gentle giants so you softened up
And you been jackin', beanin', stalkin' just to get to me, love
I wanna be your golden goose, I wanna shave my legs for you
I wanna take all of my hair down and let you lay in it
Spread all of my limbs out and let you lay in it

Pretty little birds, pretty little birds (Pretty little birds)
Do you mean every word? You mean every word? (Do you mean?)
Pretty little girls, pretty little girls (Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty)
We hit the window a few times (The wall, the wall)

Bah-da-dum-bah, but I can't stay
But I would lay
But I would (Ooh)
I would

Lately, I feel like I'm robbin' myself
Like I'm robbin' mines
Diamond cerebral, peek into your cortex
Be faithful and free and just play in your vortex
I see you, 'Lana, you fly by the pound (Pound)
Fly by the ounce (Ounce)
Fly to the south
Don't mind them bitches that's cleanin' my house
Lord, you can see, Lord
You see them heights that they just can't afford
I see them lights and you made for that shit
Fuck all that cryin', you pray for that shit, but
My wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
('Til we hit the heavens)
But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
('Til we hit the heavens)
('Til we hit the heavens)
