Mood right
Mood

You say you got a girl
Yeah, how you want me? How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless, of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, all up in your lap
Like, is you comin' home? Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

My man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You like nine to five, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday, then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

I gotta say, I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean, I'm sayin', what kind of tease is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah, Monday
And I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than, drop them drawers
I know what you want

My man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You like nine to five, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday (Don't worry 'bout none)
Then just send him my way (Don't worry 'bout none)
Think I got it covered for the weekend
