How you ain't say you was movin' forward?
Honesty hurts when you're gettin' older
I gotta say, I'll miss the way you need me, yeah
Why you ain't say you was gettin' bored?
Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?
How you lead me out so far away?

How could it be? Twenty-something
All alone, still not a thing in my name
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love, only know fear
That's me, Ms. Twenty-Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh

Stuck in them twenty-somethings, stuck in them twenty-somethings
Good luck on them twenty-somethings, good luck on them twenty-somethings
But God bless these twenty-somethings
(God bless, oh, God bless, oh, God bless, oh, God bless, oh)
Hopin' my twenty-somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the twenty-somethings don't kill me, don't kill me

Weird
Took us so long to separate
I feel, it's permanent like a riptide, this time
Waves crashing fast, I try
Think of the past, please stay
(How could it be?)

And if it's an illusion, I don't want to wake up. I'm gonna hang on to it. Because the, the, the alternative is an abyss, it's just a hole, a darkness, a nothingness. Who wants that? You know? So that's what I think about control. And that's my story, and I'm stickin' to it
