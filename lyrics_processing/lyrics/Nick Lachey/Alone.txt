I get this feeling that Im over my head
I guess I'm over my head again
And I keep thinking that I'll get through this mess
And I'll find happiness and then

I'll have everything I wanted
But what if all I wanted
Doesn't turn out being what I, I want it to be?

Alone, alone
I'm better off alone
Than sitting around waiting for life to happen
It's heaven compared to what I had
Solo we go, no need to know who's in control
No longer will I be trapped in you
Being alone, it ain't so bad
It ain't so bad

I get this feeling that I'm falling behind
Yes, I'm falling behind, it's true
And I'd rather be here at the back of the line
Than ahead of the times with you
You might also like
If you say I'm good for nothing
At least I'm good for one thing
And to someone that means something, someday soon

Alone, alone
I'm better off alone
Than sitting around waiting for life to happen
It's heaven compared to what I had
Solo we go, no need to know who's in control
No longer will I be trapped in you
Being alone, it ain't so bad

Being without you is just what I need
'Cause I started feeling, like I can breathe
Let me be, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone (I just wanna be)
Alone alone, alone, alone, alone, alone

Alone, alone
I'm better off alone
Than sitting around waiting for life to happen
It's heaven compared to what I had
Solo we go, no need to know who's in control
No longer will I be trapped in you
Being alone, it ain't so bad
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone
Being alone, it ain't so bad
