My heart still beat for you
In your eyes I see the lie
What can I do, I'll try my best to walk away
So I don't have to feel the pain
It goes on and on, on and on
And this emptiness I feel goes on and on
On and on
As I cry myself to sleep I just can't go on
On and on
When this love I feel for you is so strong
On and on, on and on
Why can't I feel your heartbeat next to mine
The way it used to be
I love that purpose that is so right
I need you to see I try my best to walk away
But I just can't ignore the pain
It goes on and on, on and on
And this emptiness I feel goes on and on, on and on
As I cry myself to sleep I just can't go on
On and on
When this love I feel for you is so strong
On and on, on and on
Can I find a way to let you know
Could I ever make you see
Baby you took my soul and took my heart
But the pain you left all for me
It goes on and on
On and on
And this emptiness I feel, it goes on and on, on and on
As I cry myself to sleep I just can't go on
On and on
When this love I feel for you is so strong
On and on, on and on
You've got someone else to share your nights
I guess it's meant to be
In your eyes I see the lie
But the light's not from me
I turn around and walk away
But I'll never escape the pain
It goes on and on, on and on
