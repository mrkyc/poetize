It's alright, it's alright

Well, I don't even know your name
But I've been watchin' all the same
I hear your voice, I guess you're home from work again
I was the guy across the hall
I smiled at you but that was all
The one day we went at it up against the wall

It's some daily habit, we can't wait to grab it
We both gotta have it, just give me a sign

I'm comin' over tonight
And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright
I'm comin' over tonight
And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright

You're gettin' off, yeah I can tell
If walls could talk, they'd probably yell (it's alright)
Don't know your name, but I should know your body well
Temptation's only steps away
A game of this we like to play
Your light is on, you're tellin' me that it's ok
You might also like
It's some daily habit, we can't wait to grab it
We both gotta have it, just give me a sign

I'm comin' over tonight
And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright
I'm comin' over tonight
And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright

Come up, come in, I wanna see ya baby (I'm comin' over tonight)
Cause we know how to do it
Come up, come in, I wanna see ya baby (I'm comin' over tonight)
Cause we know how to do it

I saw you in the hall today (Nothin' left to say)
But still I know what's in your head
I'll see you later on in bed
I smiled at you but that was all
Then one day we went at it up against the wall

It's some daily habit, we can't wait to grab it
We both gotta have it, just give me a sign
I'm comin' over tonight
Come in, it's alright
I'm comin' over tonight
And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright
I'm comin' over tonight
And if you leave on the light
It means you're sayin' come in, it's alright
I'm comin' over tonight (Come up, come in, I wanna see ya, baby)
I'm comin' over tonight
