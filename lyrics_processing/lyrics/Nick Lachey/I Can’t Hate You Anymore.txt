Ooh
Ooh

An empty room can be so deafening
The silence makes you wanna scream
It drives you crazy
I chased away the shadows of your name
And burned the picture in a frame
But it couldn't save me

And how could we quit something we never even tried?
Well, you still can't tell me why

We built it up to watch it fall
Like we meant nothing at all
I gave and gave the best of me
But couldn't give you what you need
You walked away, you stole my life
Just to find what your looking for
But no matter how I try
I can't hate you anymore
I can't hate you anymore
(Yeah, yeah)
You might also like
You're not the person that you used to be
The one I want who wanted me
And that's a shame, but
There's only so many tears that you can cry
Before it drains the light right from your eyes
And I can't go on that way

And so I'm letting of everything we were (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt

We built it up to watch it fall
Like we meant nothing at all
I gave and gave the best of me
But couldn't give you what you need
You walked away, you stole my life
Just to find what you're looking for
But no matter how I try
I can't hate you anymore
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

Sometimes you hold so tight, it slips right through your hands
Will I ever understand?
We built it up to watch it fall
Like we meant nothing at all
I gave and gave the best of me
But couldn't give you what you need
You walked away, you stole my life
Just to find what you're looking for
But no matter how I try
I can't hate you anymore
We built it up to watch it fall
Like we meant nothing at all (Yeah, yeah)
I gave and gave the best of me (Oh)
But couldn't give you what you need (Yeah yeah)
You walked away, you stole my life (Yeah)
Just to find what your looking for (Yeah, yeah)
But no matter how I try
