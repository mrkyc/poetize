Are you alone? Pause on the phone
I can't hear what you say
The sound of your voice isn't the same
Like it's so far away
What you mean, "Where I've been"?
I could ask you the same
I'm talking too loud, are you in a crowd?
Whose that calling your name?

I think I'm losing you
You're breaking up
Static on the wire
Got a bad connection
Fading out in reality
Is this happening to us?

I think I'm losing you
You're breaking up
Static on the wire
Got a bad connection
Fading out in reality
Is this happening to us?
You might also like
I only heard
One or two words
Will you say that again?
It's so hard to hear
Yet made it so clear
That this call's got to end
Sure I know, you gotta go
But you won't tell me why
You say that you never thinks cool
But you don't say goodbye

I think I'm losing you
You're breaking up
Static on the wire
Got a bad connection
Fading out in reality
Is this happening to us?
I think I'm losing you
You're breaking up
Static on the wire
Got a bad connection
Fading out in reality
Is this happening to us?
Well, your voice, it sounds so strange
And another somethings changed
Need to hear the words to know
That was starting to let go and
I never thought it would end this way
When there's so much left to say
From the start I was on the phone
It seems that you're already gone

What you mean, "Where I've been"?
I could ask you the same
I'm talking too loud, are you in a crowd?
Whose that calling your name?

I think I'm losing you (Losing you)
You're breaking up
Static on the wire
Got a bad connection (Baby)
Fading out in reality (losing you)
Is this happening to us? (Is this happening to us?)
I think I'm losing you (Losing you)
You're breaking up
Static on the wire
Got a bad connection (Baby, baby)
Fading out in reality
Is this happening to us?
Oh no no no no
No no no no
