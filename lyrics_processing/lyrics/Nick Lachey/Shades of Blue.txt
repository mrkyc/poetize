Looks like another day
Slipping through my window shade
Chasing the dark away
Seeking into my room again
Are you a sad and lonely thing?
Come to steal my piece of mind
The only peace I find
Is pretending your that still laying next to me

So why, why, why
The sun has gotta shine, shine
Why don't it just stay away?
Why do dreams have to fade
Into all these shades of blue?
Where I wait for you
Pray love reaches through
All these shades, shades of blue
When you close your eyes
Feel me by your side
I will wait for you
In all these shades of blue

Thinking back on my mistakes
I can't undo all the days that I misused
I thought that you'd always stay
Its hard to face the simple truth
That time brings no relief
And time is all you need you said
Had to go clear out your head
While your trying to decide if you'll come back to me
You might also like
Why, why, why
Do we have to cry cry cry?
Tell me why this has to be?
Why don't you give into me?
Baby, all these shades of blue
Where I wait for you
Pray love reaches through
All these shades, shades of blue
When you close your eyes
Feel me by your side
I will wait for you
Here in all these shades of blue
Here in all these shades of blue

Why did you have to leave?
Why did you have to set me free?
Why did you have to go?
Why did you have to leave?
Why did you have to set me free?
Why did you have to go?

Baby, all these shades of blue
Where I wait for you
Pray love reaches through
All these shades, shades of blue
When you close your eyes
Feel me by your side
And I will wait for you
In all these shades of blue
