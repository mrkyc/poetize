Don't think I can ever stop
I can't help the way I'm feelin'
So babe, tell me what you got
My love, you know that you can steal it
My head is reelin'
Everyone has got a price to pay, yeah

Been hurt, baby took my licks
But ain't no use in cryin'
You're my drug, gotta get my fix
Somehow, you keep my spirit flyin'
There's no denyin'
Wouldn't have it any other way, no, no

And after everything you put me through
All I think about is you

Hey, I can't stop lovin'
No, I can't stop lovin' you
(Gonna blow a fuse) No, I can't stop lovin'
(If I can't have you) No, I can't stop lovin' you
You might also like
Are you lookin' for another man?
My heart can't keep from breakin'
He can't give it to you like I can
Don't you know you're makin' a mistake, yeah
My body's achin'
Gotta find a way to make you stay, yeah, yeah

Cause nothin' ever felt so good
As when I'm makin' love to you

(One plus one is two) Hey, I can't stop lovin'
(Nothin' left to prove) No, I can't stop lovin' you
(Gonna blow a fuse) No, I can't stop lovin'
(If I can't have you)

Hold onto this emotion (Hold onto this emotion)
Hold onto me tonight (Hold onto me tonight)
Love's an infinite ocean (Love's an infinite ocean)
Don't let it die

Hey, I can't stop lovin'
No, I can't stop lovin' you
(Gonna blow a fuse) No, I can't stop lovin'
(If I can't have you) I can't stop lovin' you, oh no
(One plus one is two) You know I can't stop lovin' you
(Nothin' left to prove) No, I can't stop lovin' you
(Gonna blow a fuse) No, I can't stop lovin'
(If I can't have you) Oh, I can't stop lovin' you
(One plus one is two) Hey, I can't stop lovin' you, oh no
(Nothin' left to prove) Oh no, I can't stop lovin' you
(Gonna blow a fuse) Hey, I can't stop lovin', no
