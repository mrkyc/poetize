Satellites blastin' through the universes
It's outta sight
It's all in my head
Saw your eyes (Saw your eyes)
Sending me a message for the last time
Here alone
Holding on to something that I've never known
It's all in my head
I've crossed the line
There's no going back and there's no future
And tell me this isn't happening

She said, she said
Said she wants to marry me
It's all in my head
That's just not reality
It's over, it's over
She said it's all in my head (She says she wants to marry me)
It's all in my head
I got my own take on reality

Here on earth
She don't even wanna talk
There are no words
It's outta my hands
So why, why (Why)
Tell me this isn't happening
You might also like
She said, she said
Said she wants to marry me
It's all in my head
That's just not reality
It's over, it's over
She said it's all in my head (She says she wants to marry me)
It's all in my head
I got my own take on reality

Someone wake me up when she calls me (When she calls me)
It's like I've been asleep since she's gone (Like I've been asleep since she's gone)
Someone let her know I'm not breathing
Tell me this isn't happening
Tell me this isn't happening

She said, she said (She said)
Said she wants to marry me
It's all in my head (All in my head)
That's just not reality
It's over, it's over (It's over)
She said it's all in my head
She said, she said
Said she wants to marry me (It's all in my head)
It's all in my head
That's just not reality
It's over, it's over (O-o-over)
And she said it's all in my...
All in my head
All in my head
It's all in my head
All in my head
All in my head (Oh)
All in my head (Oh)
All in my head (Oh)
She said it's all in my head
It's all in my head
