Did I ever tell you I'm better to have known you?
I don't wanna leave you with the shadow of a doubt
Did I ever give you the strength you've given me?
And how can I begin to make each moment mean the most so you will see?
I never loved you more than I do today
Sometimes life just seems to get in the way

It's been too long
I wanna sit down and write for you the perfect love song
I wanna shout it out in a silent crowd
I wanna move you in a million ways
I'll say it to you everyday
Did I ever tell you I love you that way?

And did I ever tell you I'm better to have known you?
I don't wanna change you 'cause I'm proud of who you are
And should you ever question the pain we're going through
What I need to mention is that life just isn't living without you
You know I want you more than anything
Sometimes I just forget to say what I mean

It's been too long
I wanna sit down and write for you the perfect love song
I wanna shout it out in a silent crowd
I wanna move you in a million ways
I'll say it to you everyday
Did I ever tell you I love you that way?
You might also like
I never loved you more than I do today
Sometimes it's crazy
Life; it just gets in the way

It's been too long
I wanna sit down and write for you the perfect love song
I wanna shout it out in a silent crowd
I wanna move you in a million ways
I'll say it to you everyday
Did I ever tell you I love you that way?
It's been too long
I wanna sit down and write for you the perfect love song
I wanna shout it out in a silent crowd
I wanna move you in a million ways
I'll say it to you everyday
Did I ever tell you I love you that way?
