I guess this is the part when I
Confess I want to make you mine
I swear that I won't waste your heart
Or let what we build fall apart
I promise to the universe
That I'll be all that you deserve
And nothing less than everything
No matter what tomorrow brings
And when the music starts playing
And the stars stop shining
Won't you take my hand and come with me?

'Cause I'm just looking for someone to dance with
Someone to hold when the night ends
Tell me that you are the one
'Cause I don't want anyone else
I'm looking for someone to dance with
Someone to hold when the night ends
Tell me that you are the one
'Cause I don't want anyone else

If the sun goes down in paradise
I question everything in life
If I knew then what I know now
I'd find my way to you somehow
But if you feel the same, say it
And if it's real, don't fight it
If you take my hand and come with me
You might also like
'Cause I'm just looking for someone to dance with
Someone to hold when the night ends
Tell me that you are the one
'Cause I don't want anyone else
I'm looking for someone to dance with
Someone to hold when the night ends
Tell me that you are the one
'Cause I don't want anyone else

Here we are face to face
All my fears fade away
You're the fire when it's cold
In our hearts and in our bones
My love will never burn out
My love will never burn away

I'm just looking for someone to dance with
Someone to hold when the night ends
Tell me that you are the one
'Cause I don't want anyone else
I'm looking for someone to dance with
Someone to hold when the night ends
Tell me that you are the one
