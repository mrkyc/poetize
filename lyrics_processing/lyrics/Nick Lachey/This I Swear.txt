You're there by my side, in every way
I know that you will not forsake me
I'd give you my life, would not think twice
Your love is all I need, believe me

I may not say it quite as much as I should
But when I say I love you, darlin', that means for good
So open up your heart and let me in

And I will love you, until forever
Until death do us part, we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight
And we'll get there, this I swear

I'm wonderin' how I ever got by
Without you in my life to guide me
Wherever I go, the one thing that's true
Is everything I do, I do for you

I may not say it half as much as I should
But when I say I love you, darlin', that means for good
So open up your heart and let me in
You might also like
And I will love you, until forever
Until death do us part, we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight
And we'll get there, this I swear

So whenever you get weary, just reach out for me
I'll never let you down, my love (My love, my love)

And I will love you, until forever (Forever)
Until death do us part, we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight (And hold on tight)
We'll get there
And I will love you (And I will love you), until forever
Until death do us part (Until death do us part), we'll be together
(I'll be there for you) So take my hand (So take my hand and I'll be there)
And hold on tight (And hold on tight)
And we'll get there, oh, we'll get there
