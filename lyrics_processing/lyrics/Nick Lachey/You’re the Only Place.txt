Seems like our love is on the road to nowhere fast
All my life I thought a love like this would last
But every road can hide a corner we can't see
I had a vision that I woke up by your side
I felt you're breathing in the songs were written
But who can choose the destiny
Not me
We had it all, right in our hands
We had the room to fly and still the place to land

And so I'm calling now, I'm calling now
You're the only one
Who can say words from what we've done
That don't leave me hanging up
I'm reaching out and praying you'd come back again
It's just darkness of the evening
And you're the only place my heart has ever been

Maybe I'm longing in a ways of love naive
Maybe I'm desperate for a reason to believe
There wasn't anywhere I thought that we would fall
I've seen perfection in a rainbow in the sky
I've seen a child who makes the coldest run and cry
But loving you, I thought was greater than them all
And we had it all, just you and me
And now there's a doorway to me heart without a key
You might also like
And so I'm calling now, I'm calling now
You're the only one
Who can say words from what we've done
That don't leave me hanging up (Hanging up)
I'm reaching out and praying you'd come back again
It's just darkness of the evening
And you're the only place my heart has ever been

Wherever you are right now
Come back, baby, show me how you feel
Because I'm lost without you here

I'm calling now, I'm calling now
You're the only one (You're the only one)
Now take a look at what I become
And don't leave me hanging up
I'm reaching out and praying you'd come back again
It's just darkness of evening
