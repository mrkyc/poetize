Yeah, yeah

I met this girl Friday night
She said, "Why don't you come with me?"
"Anywhere, let's take a ride"
She says, "Who knows what we might see"
I was ready to go, but I didn't know
Fate was gonna stop me
I met this girl, she rocked my world
And she's there waitin' for me

But the train was late, she's at the gate
I'm stuck in the rain, she got on the plane
I guess this girl will hate me forever
I guess we're not meant to be together

If that's the way it is, then that's the way it goes
Everybody knows
If that's the way it fits, then that's the way it flows
It's outta your control, just let go
Let go

I thought I knew back in school
That I would be a doctor
Mom said "Study hard and you'll go far."
But then I went and shocked her
I said, "I'm leavin' today to go to LA
I wanna be a rockstar"
I thought I knew, but I'm a fool
Now I'm sleepin' on the cold floor

Where's my private jet, it ain't happened yet
Cristal champagne, I'm stuck in the rain
Sorry mom, don't hate me forever
I guess I shoulda kept it together

If that's the way it is, then that's the way it goes
Everybody knows
If that's the way it fits, then that's the way it flows
It's outta your control
Just let go, Just let go

You can try to make the sun rise again
And you can try to turn the tides, but you can't
You try the call, you can sign your name
Hold on so tight that you'll go insane
You can try to plan your life to the minute
You can try to run the race till you win it
You can buy the house, you can own the car
Doesn't matter who you are
'Cause if the train is late, you gotta wait
Got your private plane, sit in the rain
All of us are in this together
So let go, let go (Let go)

If that's the way it is, then that's the way it goes
Everybody knows
If that's the way it fits, then that's the way it flows
It's outta your control (If that's the way it is)
So I met this girl Friday night
She said, "Why don't we just take a ride?"
(Then that's the way it goes) So let's go
(Everybody knows) Let's go
(If that's the way it fits)
Yeah I met this girl Friday night
She said, "Why don't we just take a ride and go?"
Let's go
(It's outta your control) Let's go

(Just let go) Just let go
(Just let go) Just let go
