Sometimes I don't know
Where do I go, and who do I turn to?
Cause you have found something new
Somebody who makes you feel soulful

So tell me this time
'Cause you know I'm losing my mind
Is the feeling mutual
'Cause I, I just gotta know, I gotta know

Tell me (Could you love?)
I got my heart invested (Would you love)
If I gave my best and (Could you love)
Here's the question (Could you love me?)
Could you love me? (Could you love?)
I'll leave myself wide open (Would you love?)
And inside I'm hoping (Could you love?)
'Cause words unspoken
(Could you love me?) Could you love me?

I, I can't hesitate
'Cause now it's too late
Just look what you've done to me
You might also like
So tell me this time
Don't you know I'm losing my mind?
Is the feeling mutual?
'Cause I, baby, I just gotta know, I gotta know

Now tell me (Could you love?)
I got my heart invested (Would you love?)
If I gave my best and (Could you love?)
Here's the question (Could you love me)
Could you love me (Could you love?)
I'll leave myself wide open (Would you love?)
And inside I'm hoping (Could you love?)
'Cause words unspoken
Could you love me?

Do you understand?
I'll give you all I can
What more can I do?
Oh no, no
I gotta let you know
I gotta let my feelings show
But would you love, baby, could you love me
The way I love you?
Could you love
I got my heart invested (Would you love?)
If I gave my best and (Could you love?)
Here is the question (Could you love me?)
Baby, tell me, could you love me? (Could you love?)
I'll leave myself wide open (Would you love)
And inside, I'm hoping (Could you love?)
'Cause words unspoken
Could you love me?

(Could you love?) Ooh, ooh
(Would you love?) Would you love me?
Could you love me? (Oh baby)
