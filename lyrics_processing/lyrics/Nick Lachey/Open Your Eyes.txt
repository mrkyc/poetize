Yeah, baby

He told you he can be the man that I can never be
He has a way of making promises that he can't keep
He gets so angry, when I try to pom this sound
And still its you who always calling me late at night
I know you miss the way I use to hold your body tight
You needed me, but girl
You never say it, now

If you love him more just tell me so (Tell me so)
But do one thing for me before you go

Open your eyes
Girl, if its love, why can't you sleep?
Why don't you try to let me hold you tight?
And if its the last thing that I ever do
Let me make this clear to you (Open your eyes)
And don't be blinded by his promises (Open your eyes)
What he says isn't who he is
There's more to us then you realize
So open your eyes
You might also like
I know that history is something that we can't ignore
Just give me half a chance
I'll make it better than before
Wish what I did was give you wings to find a way
And if it's yesterday that keeps your heart from coming home
Girl, I apologize for all the things that I've done wrong
To lose your love would be a price to high to pay
Yeah

He can't love you more than I do (I do)
Girl don't let his sweet lies blind you
Open your eyes

Girl, if it's love that gets you sleep at night (Open your eyes)
Why don't you try to let me hold you tight
If it's the last thing that I ever do
Let me make this clear to you (Open your eyes)
Don't be blinded by his promises (Open your eyes)
Know what he says isn't how it is
There's more to us then you realize
Just open your eyes

Every night...
I, say a lonely prayer
That you
Wake up and find
My love is waiting here
(Open your eyes)
(Here, baby)
If it's the last thing I ever do
Let me make this clear to you (Open your eyes)
Don't be blinded by his promises (Open your eyes)
What he says isn't how it is
There's more to us than you realize
Open your eyes
Oh, open your eyes
