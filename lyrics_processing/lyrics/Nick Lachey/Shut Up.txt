Oh, oh, oh
Shut up

You say you want me, that you hate me
Try to love me, wanna break me
Guess I'm sleepin' on the couch again
You say "no" when you mean "yes"
Is this a game? Some kind of test?

Now why can't we just
Turn out the light, forget how to fight?
'Cause we got tonight (Cause')

When we take our clothes off, don't you know the world stops?
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up for a moment
We are mind to mind on one thing, you and me or nothing
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up
Don't say anything at all

Throw a glass straight at my head
Swear up and down you want me dead
I guess love is in the air tonight
You bite my neck, I pull your hair
Next thing we know, no underwear
You might also like
Now why can't we just
Turn out the light, forget how to fight
Cause we got tonight (Cause')

When we take our clothes off, don't you know the world stops?
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up for a moment
(Turn out the light, forget how to fight, 'cause we got tonight)
We are mind to mind on one thing, you and me or nothing
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up
(Oh, it just had to be you)
When we take our clothes off, don't you know the world stops?
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up for a moment
(Oh, it just had to be you)
We are mind to mind on one thing, you and me or nothing
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up
Don't say anything at all

Use your tounge to wet your lips
Touch 'em with your finger tips
Don't say nothing else
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up (Oh oh oh)
Only wanna hear your breath
No sigh or scream, you're nothing less
Don't say nothing else
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Oh oh oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah yeah
Shut up
When we take our clothes off, don't you know the world stops?
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up for a moment
(Turn out the light, forget how to fight, 'cause we got tonight)
We are mind to mind on one thing, you and me or nothing
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up
(Oh, it just had to be you)
When we take our clothes off, don't you know the world stops?
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up for a moment
(Oh, it just had to be you)
We are mind to mind on one thing, you and me or nothing
When we touch, when we kiss, when we shut up
