Filler
Album filler
Just a little somethin' to make the album a little chiller
And check it out. I came here
To a point quite clear
That I can rock a microphone and rock it without fear
Cause use the mic like a rod and cast off
And people say "Damn, he can rhyme his ass off,"
But hey, I knew that since the day
That I left Hollis, Queens and came out to LA
But people didn't listen
They just started dissin'
Cause they didn't know that Young MC was on a mission
Doin' the best that I could do with my ability
And rockin' the microphone until you suffer from senility
That's old age
Cause I'm in a rage
And I'm sayin' funky lyrics while I'm up on stage
You never knew what I could do until I did it
So people I suggest that you best get with it

That filler
Album filler
Don't drink Coor's, Budweiser or Miller
I just drink my soda and have a ball
Cause I don't seek pleasure in alcohol
Ok, see. Look at me
Y-O-U-N-G-M-C
I'm tall proud and black
And on the mic, not whack
And I'm sayin funky lyrics on a 24 track
Tape that I use for production
Engineers follow my instructions
The finished product comes out clear
And it's the jam that you hear right here
I'm not no fad like JJ
Livin' in my hay-day
May the first is also known as May Day
I make the money and take the time
That's the reason that I wrote the rhyme

My name's not Phyllis and it's definitely not Diller
My name is Young MC, maybe "Young" for short
And when I pick up a mic I say a rhyme for sport
Alright kick it
Let's the wicked
If I got a stamp for a letter I'll lick it
Then I go to the Post Office, put it in the mail
Then I go back home and chill
Don't you know
This is how it go
Young MC is like a one man show
I got an hour to do this, to make it sell
It's just me, a mic and an SP12
Movin', that's what the Young man does
When this hits the street you're gonna feel the buzz
From the pools, the clubs and the radios
Got three verses down, one verse to go

About filler
Album filler
If my mic was a weapon then I guess I'd be a killer
But you know violence is not my way of course
I'd rather pick up a mic and say a rhyme with force
So don't even test it
I've never been bested
And never date a woman who is too flat-chested
No, that's not the way I go out
Cause when I'm with a girl I make her scream and shout
So check it
Girls get nekkid
And fellows get hype when they hear me on a rekkid
And if you think I'm soft you must be out of your mind
Just because I got a Grammy don't mean I can't rhyme
Hard, just like I used to do
Because raps not a game like Husker Du
It's somethin' serious although it's fun
And it's time to go because I'm just about done
With filler
