Young MC's in the house goin' "Um dee dum"
And I came to turn it out goin' "Um dee dum"
And everybody that I meet goin' "Um dee dum"
They see me walkin' down the street goin' "Um dee dum"
And everybody in the place goin' "Um dee dum"
They want the treble and the bass goin' "Um dee dum"
Now don't you think it would be fun goin' "Um dee dum"
If we could have a funky drum goin' "Um dee dum"
The beat is comin' right now goin' "Um dee dum"
An' people sayin' "Oh wow!" goin' "Um dee dum"
Cause it's a new concept goin' "Um dee dum"
Keepin' you in step goin' "Um dee dum"
The day I wrote this song goin' "Um dee dum"
I spent the whole day long goin' "Um dee dum"
I hope you get the gist goin' "Um dee dum"
The record goes like this goin' "Um dee dum"
So here we go

People, people lend me an ear
So I can tell you bout, what about right here
Somethin' I do when times are rough
Or as daily life seems to get too tough
I take a second and I make this sound
Something simple to calm me down
It may sound funny. It may sound dumb
But it's surprising the power of an um dee dum
See human beings will go through stress
And that prevents you from doin' your best
Take a second to clear your head
And don't get mad do this instead
I don't mean you have to do it out loud
They think you're crazy if you're out in a crowd
Do it in your head for the same effect
An' it'll do more for you then you might expect
See it's not easy bein' Young MC
A lot of people put stress on me
But I just chill. I don't react with force
Cause in the big picture it's par for the course
I don't want to be a mean guy
Cause if I was mean I would ask myself,"Why?
Why do I have to be this way when I can simply stop and say

'When I'm feelin' kinda low I'm goin' 'Um dee dum'
And when I'm really on the go I'm goin' 'Um dee dum'
In the middle of the day I'm goin' 'Um dee dum'
When I got nothin' else to say I'm goin' 'Um dee dum'
To all the women and the men they're goin' 'Um dee dum'
If you can play this song again you're hearin' 'Um dee dum'
To all the boys and girls goin' 'Um dee dum'
And everybody in the world they're goin' 'Um dee dum'
You thought that I was done goin' 'Um dee dum'
I'm havin' too much fun goin' 'Um dee dum'
You know the song is deep goin' 'Um dee dum'
You're gonna hear me in your sleep goin 'Um dee dum'
And when I am through goin' 'Um dee dum'
I bet I'm gonna hear you goin' 'Um dee dum'
Well what do you know? Goin 'Um dee dum'
I guess it's time to go. Goin 'Um dee dum'."
