Attention party people, it's an A.P.B
That is an all-points bulletin from Young MC
Now whether you're a senior citizen or just a tyke
Just grab a seat and pay attention as I rock the mic
I wrote a couple of rhymes, I call 'em "Just Say No"
Dedicated to the people who are on the go
And they can help you out if you're on the brink
And if you listen, this jam will make you think
If you are ever in a situation
Without enough time for contemplation
All of your friends go in the same way
You feel kind of trapped, you don't know what to say
Just say no, 'cause better safe than sorry
This is for real, this ain't no game or folly
It's your life and you've only got one
So you better do it right or it will soon be done
You want to be popular, you want to be cool
You want to be the one that everybody likes at school
You want be everything just for everyone else
But you better think of what you wanna be for yourself
You might also likeEvery day, people livin' in the same old mess
Hard to be original and not be like the rest
You gotta go for what you know, you can't afford to guess
And heaven knows what would happen if you did say yes

So say no
Just say no
You hear me? Say no
Just say no

Kids O.D. and cause a family's grief
Over the marijuana plant and the coca leaf
Or a bunch of pills to try to get their thrills
Over a drug you shoot, because you think's it cute
Over something you smoke, man, it ain't no joke
Over somethin' you drink, homeboy, why don't you think?
Over something you snort, like you were playing a sport
One day you'll go too far and then you'll come up short
Some people out there don't seem to get my point
Telling others "Crack Kills" while they're smoking a joint
But the point of this song is to tell you the facts
Some people die from smoking reefer like they die from crack
Not a drug in particular, but drugs in general
They're not good for you, like a vitamin or a mineral
They come in liquid, leaves, powder, pills and rocks
Can put you six feet under on your back in a box

So say no
Just say no
Do you hear me, say no
