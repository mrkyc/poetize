More music, more music
Roll it, baby
Roll with the punches is what I tell
To people when things don't go too well
When you go for the gold and you come back empty
When the ups are few and the downs are plenty
When you talk with the girl that you always desired
You busted a move, but the move backfired
When life puts you in the little crunches
Don't give up, you got to roll with the punches
Roll it, baby
Work, no matter what occupation
Any time's good time for vacation
Every day's the same you can't believe the monotony
So when the weekend comes it's like you had a lobotomy
You can't do a thing without the boss start yellin'
It wouldn't be bad if his breath wasn't smellin'
A good day's work for a good day's pay
But that's before Uncle Sam takes a portion away
Now a lot of times you feel just like quittin'
But without a job, you're home alone sittin'
Checkin' the want ads for jobs to fill
Watchin' soaps, Geraldo and Oprah and Phil
You might also likeMy advice is to roll with it, honey
And soon you'll find that you'll be in the money
Expense accounts and three martini lunches
And that's what you get when you roll with the punches
Roll it, baby
You got to roll with the punches
Roll with it
Roll it, baby
Lotto, take your chance for a dollar
If I win, then I'll scream and holler
High on the hog is the way to be
And it's def livin' in the lap of luxury
I picked four numbers they were all okay
For the fifth and sixth I used my birthday
But I erased my birthday and said better yet
I'll use the birthday of a girlie that I just met
I filled out the ticket gave it a kiss for luck
Handed it to the agent with a brand-new buck
Went home to watch TV on a Saturday night
Four numbers came up and they were all alright
Now what happened next, nearly made me drop dead
It wasn't her birthday, it was mine instead
I said next time I'll just play my hunches
But what the heck, I'll just roll with the punches
Roll with it
You got to go with the flow
Roll with it, baby
Like this
Women, let me tell you about 'em
Can't live with them, can't live without 'em
The ones you like only seem to hate you
The ones you hate only seem to date you
Girls will often tell you, you come on too strong
You've got to take it slow to make the love last long
But I say the early bird catches the worm
The late bird gets the girlie with the two-dollar perm
Man, that put me in dilema
Case in point a fly girl name Gemma
I met this lady at a quiet place
About 5 years ago we were face to face
I stepped up to her, tossed the first line
Like fishin' I was wishin' that the girl would be mine
I told my best jokes and she started smilin'
A voice inside said, "Yo Young, you're stylin'"
But then Gemma really startin actin' silly
'Cause she broke up with her boyfriend Billy
She wanted advice and she was coming to me
I said, "You need Dear Abby, not the Young MC"
Because I don't mind being a shoulder to cry on
But I need one who needs a body to lie on
'Cause nowadays, I got girls by the bunches
Yeah, I got smart and just rolled with the punches
Roll it, baby
You got to go with the flow
Roll it, baby
Nowadays I got girls by the bunches
