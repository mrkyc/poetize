There ain't much to see here, it's what they say
You just grow up then move away
'Cause one red light and white picket fences
Can't cage a wild heart in
Head for the city, make a little money
Find a good girl if you get lucky
One day, you'll wake up and something's gone missin'
You'll sure miss the way back when

When life was a Mellencamp song
It was faded blue jeans
On the hood of a hand-me-down Chevy
With all your first best friends
And time says you can't go back
Oh, but just like that
You know what it is you've been missin'
Friday night, small town, American livin'

I sure missed leavin' the doors unlocked
Worms on the shovel, fish off the dock
Mud up the fender, let down the window
Hand flyin' free in the wind
I sure liked knowin' all my neighbors
Back when I really meant "see you later"
Football lights and fall county fairs
And kissin' on ferris wheels

When life was a Mellencamp song
It was faded blue jeans
On the hood of a hand-me-down Chevy
With all your first best friends
And time says you can't go back
Oh, but just like that
You know what it is you've been missin'
Friday night, small town, American livin'

And one day, there's a for sale sign on the edge of town
And your roots seem to find their way back in the ground

Well, life is a Mellencamp song
It's faded blue jeans
On the hood of a hand-me-down Chevy
With all your first best friends
And time says you can't go back
Oh, but just like that
You get what it is you've been missin'
Friday night, small town, American livin' (Yeah)

A little Friday night, small town livin'
