I just can't get away from a good time
It started out innocent enough, hangin' in the backyard workin' on my truck
Turning some wrenches, cranking some tunes
A typical Saturday afternoon
Next thing you know my neighbor Pete walked back
Said his weed whacker'd run outta gas, we looked hard
Couldn't find a drop, ended up at the fridge in the back of my shop
One cold one turned into four
Four's gotta way of turning into more
Bust out the weiners, bust out the buns
Fire up the grill gonna have a little fun

Follows me around wherever I go, just like the wake behind my old bass boat
One minute I'm just hanging around
Next thing you know a damn party breaks out
Hey I'm just a victim of a circumstance
I've learned to make it all a part of my plans
It don't matter how hard I try
I just can't get away from a good time

We were cutting it up, and telling some jokes
Talking NASCAR and UFOs, that chainlink fence don't keep out much
The rest of the block started showing on up, ran outta charcoal
Went to the store, they were running a deal on cases of Coors
If you bought one it was regular price
But if you bought two you got a free bag of ice
Hell so I bought four, and it made me grin
I was walking out, pretty girls walking in
You could say the stars just lined up right
But it ain't luck man it's just my life

Follows me around wherever I go, just like the wake behind my old bass boat
One minute I'm just hanging around
Next thing you know a damn party breaks out
Hey I'm just a victim of a circumstance
I've learned to make it all a part of my plans
It don't matter how hard I try
I just can't get away from a good time

I guess that old truck's gonna wait another day
Maybe two or three keeps going this way, ah but I don't care
Say what you want, man we only get to live it up once

Follows me around wherever I go, just like the wake behind my old bass boat
One minute I'm just hanging around
Next thing you know a damn party breaks out
Follows me around wherever I go, just like the wake behind my old bass boat
One minute I'm just hanging around
Next thing you know a damn party breaks out
Hey I'm just a victim of a circumstance
Turned down drinking
Turned down a dance
It don't matter how hard I try
I just can't get away
I just can't get away
I can't get away
From a good time
I just can't get away
