Woulda been just fine doin what my daddy did
Til he broke down one day and brought home this guitar
I boarded that rocket ship and headed straight for the stars
I been 16 now for most of my life
I got a beat up heart, same sparkle in my eye
Didn't know any better, on the day that I left
Now I got too many songs to get off of my chest
Don't you know it ain't easy for a guitar man
I'm just livin' on dreams doin all that I can
To shake off these demons and make my stand
I left my life out in the country for a rock and roll band
I can still feel the wind, still see the Kansas wheat
That red dress summer romance and all the John Deere green
I talked to mama on the phone while I changed my strings
She knows the words to all my songs, but I pray she don't know what they mean
Don't you know it ain't easy for a guitar man
You might meet a nice girl you'll never see her again
Each night a new city and I make my stand
I left my life out in the country for a rock and roll band
There's days that I wish that I was singin in the choir
I'd have saved money on beer, saved money on tires
Coulda left my roots right there in the dirt
A little grease on my hands and my name on my shirt
Don't you know it ain't easy for a guitar man
Yea there's only one cure for the shape that I'm in
So I tune it up and sing 'em all again
I left my life out in the country for a rock and roll band
No I can't help it, its just who I am
