That we talked about for years
I always said we'd start a better life down there
Forget about here
This flatland wind is bound to blow you somewhere
If you ain't hangin' on
Now, I always thought we'd fly away together
But I guess I was wrong
Cause you beat me to the punch
Last I heard, someone else did too
Hey Carolina
I never needed you anyway
And the february weather's nice in Kansas
And I'm really okay
Well, I hope he makes you happy
And I wish you both the best
And it really feels good
To get all this off my chest
Hey Carolina
I never needed you anyway
Well, I joined the gospel choir down at church
Bought me an electric guitar
I'm learning all them old Johnny Cash songs
Makin' new friends at the bar
See Logan Mize LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also likeI saw a movie on the TV
Late the other night
Saw a pretty girl under a palm tree
But you never crossed my mind
Hey Carolina
I never needed you anyway
The february weather's nice in Kansas
And I'm really okay
Well, I hope he makes you happy
And I wish you both the best
And it really feels good
To get all this off my chest
Hey Carolina
I never needed you anyway
Well, I hope all your wildest dreams have come true
Yeah, I hope it's everything you'd thought it be
And everytime he wraps his arms around you
I hope you don't think of me
Hey Carolina
I never needed you anyway
The february weather's nice in Kansas
And I'm really okay
Hey Carolina
I never needed you anyway (Hey Carolina)
Sometimes I think I'd like to see ya but then again
I wouldn't have much to say (Hey Carolina)
Hey Carolina
I never needed you anyway (Hey Carolina)
Hey Carolina
Just go ahead and stay
Hey Carolina
I never needed you anyway
