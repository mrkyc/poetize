Makin me a hymn singer
On the Sunday's Mama made me go
I gotta thank a high school teacher for believin' in a dreamer
And steering me down the road
I gotta thank my granddaddy for the Saturday's on the lake
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I gotta thank the boys I raised all kinds of hell with
Couldn't ask for better best friends
I gotta thank Earnhardt, Springsteen, Luke Skywalker
For filling up my memory bank
I gotta thank JD, Jim Beam, Mr. Anheuser
For a friday night good time drink
I gotta thank Mama and my Daddy
For eighteen years of them gasin' up the Chevrolet tank
No matter who you are
Everybody's got somebody to thank
I gotta thank an old coon dog
For licking my hand on days I was feeling alone
I gotta thank my old man's brother
For a tour in the jungle
Just to keep us all safe at home
I gotta thank a next door neighbor
For calling that number
That morning our house caught fire
I gotta thank a midwest farmer
For a teenage summer
With a boy he didn't have to hire

Joe Montana for filling up my memory bank
I gotta thank JD, Jim Beam, Mr. Anheuser
For a friday night good time drink
I gotta thank Mama and my Daddy
For eighteen years of them gasin' up the Chevrolet tank
No matter who you are
Everybody's got somebody to thank
No I ain't forgot and I'll never forget
I gotta thank God for every day I've had
And every day I'll get
I gotta thank the love of my life
Every day and night
For filling up my memory bank
I gotta thank JD, Jim Beam, Mr. Anheuser
For a friday night good time drink
I gotta thank Mama and my Daddy
For eighteen years of them gasin' up the Chevrolet tank
No matter who you are
