Rohrer fence post starin' right back at me
Gatorade fill at the 7-11
Still hotter than hell in the shade at seven
Cash my check
Fill up the tank
Buy you a flower
And buy us a drink
To sip on
To live on
Watchin' that summer drip on
Fields of green
And baby I wouldn't change a thing

It ain't always pretty, but you are
It ain't easy, girl, but it ain't too hard
Meet you at the corner pub, save me a seat
Won't be anybody there lucky as me
A blue-collared blue-eyed worth it
Yeah, whatever we're doin' is workin'
Like Jack and Diane, just singin' our ditty
Life goes on, it ain't always pretty
But you are

Holdin' me and you laughin' at the county fair
Merry-go-round and round it goes
Just like these dusty nowhere roads
It's either too dry, or rainin'
It's either hurry-up, or waitin'
I love it that you like the way I sing
Sunday mornin', cigarette, Amazing Grace

It ain't always pretty, but you are
It ain't easy, girl, but it ain't too hard
Meet me in the back pew, save me a seat
Won't be anybody there lucky as me
A blue-collared blue-eyed worth it
Yeah, whatever we're doin' is workin'
Like Jack and Diane, just singin' our ditty
Life goes on, it ain't always pretty
But you are
Whoa you are
We'll get it wrong or get it right
Funny thing about this beautiful life

It ain't always pretty, but you are
It ain't easy, girl, but it ain't too hard
Meet you on the front porch, save me a seat
Won't be anybody there lucky as me
A blue-collared blue-eyed worth it
Yeah, whatever we're doin' is workin'
Like Jack and Diane, just singin' our ditty
Life goes on, it ain't always pretty
But you are
Whoa you are
They're playin' our song, baby, sing it with me
Life goes on, it ain't always pretty
