I can see you putting on your dress
Got your hair pulled back and the radio on
Singing along to your favorite song
There's a Friday night feeling in the air
Streetlights coming on everywhere
Meet you at the door and I see your face
And you take my breath away
You're like a night on the town, I wanna stay out
You're like a skyline view and when I look down
I get a little bit high, a little shook up
I like your downtown eyes, the way they light up
I wanna go get lost down every side street
Take you for a ride and feel your heartbeat
I feel alive whenever you're with me
The night is young and love's a big city
We could find a little dive bar out of the way
Cruise the clubs up broadway
Where the beat goes on and it don't stop
We could get a drink on a rooftop
Doesn't matter as long as I'm close to you
We can do whatever you wanna do
Hold on tight when the lights change
And you take my breath away
