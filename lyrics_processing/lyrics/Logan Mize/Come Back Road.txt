Rusted tin on a little white farmhouse
Water tower on that horizon
Cottonwood tree that got hit by lightning
Old stop sign that someone shot
Couple miles outside a highway dot
In the USA that time forgot
(The USA that time forgot)
You can lose a lot of things
But it's hard to lose a hometown
Some things are bound to change
But the sun still goes down just the same
As it did back then in the way back when
You can close your eyes and count to ten
And you're standing there where the wild dreams grow
On the side of that you can always come back road
Green eyes, brown hair, blue jean jacket
Dashboard Springsteen fm magic
Football lights off in the distance
With the moon and God your only witness
Try to act like you don't miss it
You can lose a lot of things
But it's hard to lose a hometown
Some things are bound to change
But the sun still goes down just the same
As it did back then in the way back when
You can close your eyes and count to ten
And you're standing there where the wild dreams grow
On the side of that you can always come back road
