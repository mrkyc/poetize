You're dancing with me, so fine honey
I've been thinking 'bout the weekend coming
I can't wait for it, I can't wait 'cause I
I'm gonna see you on Friday night and I
I'm gonna tell you you've been on my mind
Yeah, I've been thinking about you
How you walk, how you talk, such a pretty mess
I see you dancing in your boots and your black dress
Stone cold, you're so fine
I got to let you know
If you were mine, if you were mine
I'd never ever let you go
When you move
When you shake it and you go down
Make my heart beat so loud (so loud)
You're too good to be true
Yeah, I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout the night we stayed out
Bars closing down, no one else around
I've been thinking about the way you leaned in and
And let me kiss you, made me wish you
Were all mine baby all the time
I got to tell you you've been on my mind
