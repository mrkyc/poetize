Your hair when it's up, or your hair when it's down
The top's off the Jeep and it's blowing around
From the tips of your toes to the top of your crown
Yeah, that's what I love about you
Then there's that look when I catch you off guard
Yeah, that one right there deep in your heart of hearts
You really don't know just how pretty you are
That's what I love about you

It's where you're from, baby, where you're goin'
When you're slow and easy, when you're rock 'n' rollin'
Like to raise a little hell, love your God in heaven
Red and white and blue and lucky sevens
You're heavy on the gas, little hard to handle
Wearing mama's smile and daddy's flannel
You're thinking every cloud has got a silver lining
How you point it out so I can find it too
That's what I love about you

How you light up the room with the way that it sounds
When you laugh like a kid on a merry go round
The man that you made of the man that you found
Girl, that's what I love about you
