Love is a strong word when you mean it
And baby I mean it when I say I love where this thing's headed
But this concrete city's run me ragged, let me tell you I've had it
I miss the simple life I used to know

Well I like driving around in my Ford truck, waving at the pretty girls
Slinging mud on the tail pipes and dodging the blue lights
Icing down a cooler full of High Life, it goes good with a hot night
Peppered sky full of star light, good God it's a good life

I bet our families would both be happy, if we showed up like Cousin Eddie
We could help with harvest on the farm
They'd let us park our air stream in the yard
Come on girl I'm just being funny - but for real now, honey
The clock is ticking, we're running late

I miss driving around in my Ford truck, arm around a pretty girl
Slinging mud on the tail pipes and dodging the blue lights
Icing down a cooler full of High Life, it goes good with a hot night
Peppered sky full of star light, good God it's a good life

I won't mind one day getting older, with your head on my shoulder
Watching the day's sunset, sipping tea on the front step
All the chickens and the dogs in the front yard
Rusty tractor, 50 acres and a red barn
Big dreams down a dead end dirt road, I'm sold baby let's go home

We'd go driving around in my Ford truck, you can be my pretty girl
Sling some mud on the tail pipes, we'll go dodging the blue lights
Icing down a cooler full of High Life, it goes good with a hot night
Peppered sky full of star light, good God it's a real good life

Damn right, it's a good life
Ooh, it's a real good life
It's a good life
