I got the weekend off, and nowhere to be
I got a good running truck, cranking dirt band gold
I wish you'd just jump in, we could take off and go
Oh but there you are again with all your fancy friends
It's cool girl break my heart
I try to be cool but don't know where to start
'Cause I dig you and I want you to dig me too
Yeah cool girl walk on by
'Cause girls like you they ain't got time
For good ole boys like me and that's the truth
Sometimes I can't help wishing I was cool enough for you
I'm worn out boots, and a baseball cap
I got a laid back drawl, but I can make you laugh
I know all them guys that you hang around
But I stick out too much, for the in crowd
And a pretty girl like you's, got better things to do
It's cool girl break my heart
I try to be cool but don't know where to start
'Cause I dig you and I want you to dig me too
Yeah cool girl walk on by
'Cause girls like you they ain't got time
For good ole boys like me and that's the truth
Sometimes I can't help wishing I was cool enough for you

To go and hang the moon, treat you like a queen
'Cause that's all I wanna do, gimme just one chance
One sunset drive, one dirt road dance but
It's cool girl break my heart
I try to be cool but don't know where to start
'Cause I dig you and I want you to dig me too
Yeah cool girl walk on by
'Cause girls like you they ain't got time
For good ole boys like me and that's the truth
