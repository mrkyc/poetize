Let's have a party in my El Camino
You bring the birds and baby I'll bring the bees
We can blow this town or go get pumped on a backroad
We'll get to rocking if you know what I mean
I got a mixtape with the best of Lucero
Let's have a party in my El Camino

I know your daddy tells you I'm no good
Worried that you'll pop the hood, like what I got underneath
But girl, he's just jealous of me
Can't handle the fact that I can smoke his Ranchero

Let's have a party in my El Camino
No need to wait until the end of the work day
Let's burn some rubber I can't take it no more
They're used to me not coming back after lunch break
Do they really need a greeter at the Walmart door?
Gotta get my money's worth before it gets repossessed-o

I know your daddy tells you I'm no good
Worried that you'll pop the hood, like what I got underneath
But girl, he's just jealous of me
Can't handle the fact that I can smoke his Ranchero

You need to hurry up and make up your mind
I packed a picnic basket of tacos just in queso
And you're driving me loco, so senorita, you're fine
It's me talkin' dirty, in my best Espanol

Don't let some pretty boy talk you into his jacked up Silverado
