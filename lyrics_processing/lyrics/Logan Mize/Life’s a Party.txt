Yeager bomb blowing up throwing it down
July tangled up, star spangled up
Get your girl wrangled up take her to town
Right here right on
Got a stone cold radio song
Good times good friends
Crank it up when the long week ends the world is a trip and life is a party
Rock star booty twang hip hop Marley
Jeeprack chevy stack, Back in Black Harley
The world is a trip and life is a party
It's a bottle rocket saturday night
State road running with a broken headlight
Feelin' effin better than heaven
The world is a trip and life is a party
Haybale hangin' out twin ten bangin' out
AJ singin 'bout a hoocheecoochee
The way she's drinkin' that she got me thinkin' that
She's 'bout to shoot that arrow right through me
The world is a trip and life is a party
Rock star booty twang hip hop Marley

It's a bottle rocket saturday night
State road running with a broken headlight
