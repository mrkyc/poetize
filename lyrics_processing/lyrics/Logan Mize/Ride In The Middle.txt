Don't mind these bumpy backroads
Wants to decorate my dash
With ten pink painted toes
The kind that kills
A bad hair day with a ball cap
She's happy livin' in some old town
That ain't on the map
Climb on in
Doors wide open
I'm lookin' for a girl
That wants to ride in the middle
If you like where we're going
Slide over just a little
I'll hit the clutch
You can shift the gears
We'll head out to the river
With some ice cold beer
Cast a line
Watch the sunset
Get a little cozy
Throw a blanket on the flatbed
Live the country life
Sweet and simple
I'm lookin' for a girl
Who wants to ride in the middle
If you don't mind diesel, dirt
Overalls or farmer tans
Or straight shootin'
Honest livin' kind of man
I got my truck gassed up with a spot
On the bench seat
For the right kind of girl
Who wants to come take a ride with me
I know you're out there
Don't keep me waitin'
I'm lookin' for a girl
That wants to ride in the middle
If you like where we're going
Slide over just a little
I'll hit the clutch
You can shift the gears
We'll head out to the river
With some ice cold beer
Cast a line
Watch the sunset
Get a little cozy
Throw a blanket on the flatbed
Live the country life
Sweet and simple
I'm lookin' for a girl
Who wants to ride in the middle
I'm lookin' for a girl
That wants to ride in the middle
If you like where we're going
Slide over just a little
I'll hit the clutch
You can shift the gears
We'll head out to the river
With some ice cold beer
I'm lookin' for a girl
That wants to ride in the middle
If you like where we're going
Slide over just a little
I'll hit the clutch
You can shift the gears
We'll head out to the river
With some ice cold beer
Cast a line
Watch the sunset
Get a little cozy
Throw a blanket on the flatbed
Live the country life
Sweet and simple
I'm lookin' for a girl
