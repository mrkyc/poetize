I heard my heart in my ear
She was licking a stamp
And the third time
It was my neighbor's babysitter
In a teeny weenie bikini
Poppin' out of the river
Oh the seventh time was love
We were finally at my house when nobody else was
Oh but good's as good as it gets
Until you finally find the best
Yeah you're my all time, you win
At the top of the top ten
All time solid gold
You take the cake it ain't even close
You're my straight up favorite, no lie
Don't have to think about it
Oh yeah you're my all time, you
There was that one time with that girl in LA
She got us into every party but it wasn't my thing
And then that other time she was a little bit older
She taught me things about things
And just like that it was over

The next one broke me hard and I'm glad that she did
'Cause oh that's when you came around
And put your hands on me baby
Baby hands down
Yeah you're my all time, you win
At the top of the top ten
All time solid gold
You take the cake it ain't even close
You're my straight up favorite, no lie
Don't have to think about it
Oh yeah you're my all time, you
Day time, night time, you're my favorite past time
Might not have been my first but you're gonna be my last time

Might not have been my first but you're gonna be my last time and
