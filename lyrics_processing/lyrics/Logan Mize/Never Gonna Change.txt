People call me crazy
Just a little thrown off
Cause the road they travel
Ain't the path I'm on
But it sure feels good
To be makin' my own way

When I left Kansas
Swore I'd never look back
But now that I'm gone
It makes me laugh
When I look in the mirror
And everything's still the same

Well, my best pair of jeans
Got holes in the knees
Grease stain, and a Copenhagen ring
My trucks too loud and I still drink
That cheap light beer

Some things ain't never gonna change
Like the burnin' sun down on the plains
Stiff grease still turns the windmill
The stars light up the midnight sky
Tornadoes and black clouds in May
Grain trucks on a dusty old highway
The kids are still draggin' main every Friday night
And the old men talk about the good ol' days
I guess some things ain't never gonna change

I drove my four-wheel drive
To this six-string town
While all of my buddies are settlin' down
I'm just doin' the best I can at gettin' by
Well, the longer I'm gone
The more I see
This city brings out the country in me
And finds it's way
Into every song I write

That's why I sing about dirt roads
And fishin' holes
The story of my life to a couple of chords
And it all goes good
With that cheap light beer

Some things ain't never gonna change
Like the burnin' sun down on the plains
Stiff grease still turns the windmill
The stars light up the midnight sky
Tornadoes and black clouds in May
Grain trucks on a dusty old highway
The kids are still draggin' main every Friday night
And the old men talk about the good ol' days
I guess some things ain't never gonna change
Every time I go back home
My old truck drives itself
Back over to her house
My heart still lays where it fell

Some things ain't never gonna change
Like the burnin' sun down on the plains
Stiff grease still turns the windmill
The stars light up the midnight sky
Tornadoes and black clouds in May
Grain trucks on a dusty old highway
The kids are still draggin' main every Friday night
And the old men talk about the good ol' days
I guess some things ain't never gonna change
Never gonna change
