I couldn't sleep at all last night so I opened up my eyes, it was 3 am
My mind's spinnin' around in the dark, in the past, just like that ceiling fan
It was only 1 in California, 50-50 shot she'd pick it up
I stared at my phone like it was a loaded gun
Sat on second thought

I still don't know what I wanna be when I grow up
What it means to be in love
Or if enough is ever gonna be enough
Wonder if I'll ever be somebody to someone
But when I find what it is I want
Hope I'm not, hope I'm not the only one
I hope I'm not the only one
I hope I'm not the only one

Momma always worried, but I never saw that worry'd fix a thing
Said I'd never be like that but give me one bad day and a few good drinks
There I go, rabbit hole, wonderin' what the hell does it all mean
What really matters?
Who am I?
And am I really where I'm suppsoed to be?

I still don't know what I wanna be when I grow up
What it means to be in love
Or if enough is ever gonna be enough
Wonder if I'll ever be somebody to someone
But when I find what it is I want
Hope I'm not, hope I'm not the only one
I hope I'm not the only one

Thinkin' 'bout how life just goes too fast
Thinkin' 'bout all the things I can't take back
Thinkin' 'bout why am I thinkin' 'bout that?
Sometimes I wanna pack a U-Haul up
And just leave it all and run
Tell her she's the only thing I want

I still don't know what I wanna be when I grow up
Or what it means to be in love
Or if enough is ever gonna be enough
Wonder if I'll ever be somebody to someone
When I find what it is I want
Hope I'm not, hope I'm not the only one
I still don't know what I wanna be when I grow up
What it means to be in love
Or if enough is ever gonna be enough
Wonder if I'll ever be somebody to someone
When I find what it is I want
Hope I'm not, I hope I'm not the only one
I hope I'm not the only one
