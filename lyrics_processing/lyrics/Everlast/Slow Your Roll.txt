You wanna see a dead body?
You wanna see a dead body?

Firestarter
Born to die a martyr
Blow your whole armada
Clear out the water
Sun dry harder
Hell's much hotter
Top notch shotta
Peckerwood don dada
Some gotta love it
Some gotta get above it
Pusher man shove it
'Til there ain't enough of it
Spike in your vein
Might lighten your pain
But that habit's gon' cost your soul
So slow your roll
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Stumble on across the road
And cop a baggie from the man with the gold
You might catch a hot buckshot load
Now you know
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Living down on skid row
Just waitin' 'til they tag your toe
Now you know
How it go
Death comes slow

Oh, I wanna know
Is there a place up in heaven waiting for me when it's time to go
Oh, I wanna know
Will I fly into the sky or they're sending me down below
I wanna know
(You wanna see a dead body?)

Down by the tracks
The foot of the hill
The junkie cats gather
To cure their ills
The hookers and the trannies
Sell their thrills
Pimps in the cadillacs countin' they bills
I get chills
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Is this a corpse in the alley, just under the stairs?
The hookers gettin' beaten, but no one cares
They just stare
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Who wanna interfere if you dare
The streets are watching and you best beware
People are trife, life ain't fair
Don't get scared
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Tell me how much can you really bear
Before you caught up in the blinding glare
Love is kind, love is cold
Love is rare
Oh, I wanna know
Is there a place up in heaven waiting for me when it's time to go
Oh, I wanna know
Will I fly into the sky or they're sending me down below
I wanna know
I said I wanna know, yeah
Is there a place up in heaven waiting for me when it's time to go, woah
I wanna know
I said I wanna know, yeah
Will I fly into the sky or they're sending me down below, woah
I wanna know, yeah
