Pop- pop off!

Say you know me on the outside
You never see the inside, okay... Okay
It's sick, it's such a long time
Walkin' down a thin line, okay... Okay!

I won't go down! I won't go down!
I see my life and where I've been
I'm standing here without my friends
I won't go down! I won't go down!
I see the way it's gonna end
I'm never gonna give in...

Now you're asking about the inside
Talking about the lost time, okay... Okay
I keep thinking like I'm big time
Trying to mess with your mind, okay... Okay!

I won't go down! I won't go down!
I see my life and where I've been
I'm standing here without my friends
I won't go down! I won't go down!
I see the way it's gonna end
I'm never gonna give in...

What's up 
The Prom Kings, the Game
Yo, somebody throw me a fucking guitar, man
I wanna play some fucking thing
I feel like Run-DMC, I'll walk this way or something, man
I'll show you how to rock and roll
Let's go (let's go)
The Game, yeah!

We're going front, back, side to side
Six tre Impala, thats how gangstas ride
Turn the music up, let the hood rock
And throw your muthafuckin' hands in the air like you at Woodstock
The streets is talkin', you know you heard the name
The kid that rock white crowds like Kurt Cobain
Chuck Taylor and Prom Kings, The Game that crossed over
Now I'm sitting on the throne like the Game that lost Hova
Used to get rock money like Guns 'n Roses
Still getting rock money but guns and holsters
And when the night's over I'm wearing the crown
The king of L.A. and I ain't never going down

I won't go down (I won't go)
I won't go down (I won't go)
I see my life and where I've been
I'm standing here without my friends
I won't go down (I won't go)
I won't go down (I won't go)
I see the way it's gonna end
Yeah!
I won't go down (I won't go)
I won't go down (I won't go)
I see my life and where I've been
I'm never gonna give in!
I won't go down (I won't go)
I won't go down (I won't go)
I see the way it's gonna end
I'm never gonna give in!

Yo! Chuck Taylor! Show 'em how we ride on the West Coast. Ha!
We goin' front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
We goin' front, back, side to side
