What's your deal, what's this all about?
I see your lips, move they spill
And the shit is coming out
So here I go I'm back again
I guess I'm following the trends
I should have known, I should have sensed
I should have listened to my friends
I feel insane, kind of stained
After all that we've been through
And in my brain, it ain't the same
So I shake it off on you
By the way, when you play
Frontin' like you got that class
Here's five words, I want to say
You can kiss this whiteboy's
So what do you want from me?
You're killing my sanity
I'm trying too hard to see
The sun is gone, now I'm alone
So what do you want from me?
I'm sick of you choking me
You're stealing the air I breathe
This love is gone, now you're alone
You might also likeI'm feeling black, I'm feeling blue
I'm feeling so caught up in you
I'm feeling played, I'm feeling used
I'm feeling like it's overdue
So here I go, I'm back again
It's time to listen to my friends
I checked her out, she checked me in
I'll never do that shit again
So what do you want from me?
You're killing my sanity
I'm trying too hard to see
The sun is gone, now I'm alone
So what do you want from me?
I'm sick of you choking me
You're stealing the air I breathe
This love is gone now you're alone
You're so alone
You're so alone
You're so alone
You're so alone
So what do you want from me?
You're killing my sanity
I'm trying too hard to see
The sun is gone, now I'm alone
So what do you want from me?
I'm sick of you choking me
You're stealing the air I breathe
This love is gone now you're alone
So what do you want from me?
You're killing my sanity
So what do you want? (What do you want?)
So what do you want from me?
So what do you want from me
I'm sick of you choking me
So what do you want? (What do you want)
So what do you want from me?
You're so alone
