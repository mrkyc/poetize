(Go-go-go, go wake me up)
(Wa-wa, go)
(Go-go-go, give it away, it all away)
(Go-go-go, go wake me up)
(Wa-wa, go)
(Go-go-go, give it away, it all away)

I don't care what the circumstance is
I don't care what my other plans is
I'm here for you, so take advantage
I don't care what the circumstance is
Like even if the president says
"You need to come to my defenses"
I'd tell her, "Sorry, no offenses
But someone needs my full attention"

I would drop everything
For you, I would drop everything for you
For you, I would drop everything
I would drop, drop, drop, drop everything

(Go-go-go, go wake me up)
(Wa-wa, go)
(Go-go-go, give it away, it all away)
(Go-go-go, go wake me up)
(Wa-wa, go)
(Go-go-go, give it away, it all away)
You might also like
I don't care if there is consensus
That I finally lost my senses
I'm jumping hoops and hoppin' fences
I don't care what the circumstance is
I used to think about finances
Now you supply all my demands-es
My bank account is big as France's
I'd give it up and take my chances

I would drop everything
For you, I would drop everything for you
For you, I would drop everything
I would drop, drop, drop, drop everything
Drop everything
For you, I would drop everything for you
For you, I would drop everything
I would drop, drop, drop, drop everything

(Go-go-go, go wake me up)
(Wa-wa, go)
(Go-go-go, give it away, it all away)
(Go-go-go, go wake me up)
(Wa-wa, go)
(Go-go-go, give it away, it all away)
I would drop everything
For you, I would drop everything for you
For you, I would drop everything
I would drop, drop, drop, drop everything

(Go-go-go, go wake me up)
(Wa-wa, go)
(Go-go-go, give it away, it all away)
(Go-go-go, go wake me up)
(Wa-wa, go)
