Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and chose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
Here's a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath, if you believe you can achieve, just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard, we carry on
Living in the projects, broke, with no lights on
Here's a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath, if you believe you can achieve, just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard, we carry on
Living in the projects, broke, with no lights on
No lights on, no lights on
Run, run rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race toward an early grave
Early grave
Early grave
Breathe, breathe in the air
Waiting to breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe in the air
Breathe, breathe in the air
Waiting to breath, breath
Breathe, breathe in the air
Here's a message to the newborns (breathe, breathe in the air)
Waiting to breath, if you believe you can achieve, just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard, we carry on (breathe, breathe in the air)
Living in the projects, broke, with no lights on
Here's a message to the newborns (breathe, breathe in the air)
Waiting to breath, if you believe you can achieve, just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard, we carry on (breathe, breathe in the air)
Living in the projects, broke, with no lights on
