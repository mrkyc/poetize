There's a good time to do it on your own
There's a good time, now it's time to go
There's a good time, to do it for a change
There's a good time, step out from the cage

Everyday I walk away
With the feeling that I'm center stage
There's a good time
There's a good time
Everyday I walk away
With the feeling that I'm center stage
There's a good time
There's a good time

There's a good time to do it on your own
There's a good time, now it's time to go
There's a good time, to do it for a change
There's a good time, step out from the cage

Everyday I walk away
With the feeling that I'm center stage
There's a good time (There's a good time)
There's a good time (There's a good time)
Everyday I walk away
With the feeling that I'm center stage
There's a good time (There's a good time)
There's a good time (There's a good time)
