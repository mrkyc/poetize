Huh (Huh, huh, huh)
Got it (Got it, got it, got it)
What happenin'?
Shit, no other
What up, Chinx?
Yuh, Hussle

Hey fool (Hey fool)
Bricks all in my cabinet
Gettin' money, we trappin'
Bandana on a MAC-10
Hey fool
What up though?
Smokin', watchin' my roof fold (Say what?)
Waistline where my tool go (Bet that)
Fake niggas, they fools though
Hey fool (What?)
Get shot nigga and you move around
Still serve in the school zone
Neighborhood with my jewels on
Hey fool
Shit, coolin' (Yuh)
Hittin' licks, movin' (That's right)
Posted up with my fools (That's right)
Gettin' high, we just foolin' (Yuh)
Hey fool
You might also like
I'm so used to this jealousy, stay on deck is my recipe
Can't afford no more felonies but the hood is like Tel Aviv
Start a war and then tell on me type of nigga I'll never be
Suck my dick is what I tell police
And if they catch me slippin', go kill for me
Stay on track and make mills for me
Put my daughter in your will for me
Move smarter and bill for me
And don't budge an inch on them bills for me
Fuck duckin' niggas, go hunt your beef
Play offense, I don't fuck with D
If you hop out, I hop out
That's one for you, one for me
Hey fool (What up?)
You heard how they came through (Say what?)
Yellow tape the whole block in broad day
They emptied out the whole tool (That right?)
Hey fool (What?)
Tell me what do you wanna go do
Pull up on 'em then bang his hood
Then when he bang back it's on you like

Hey fool (Hey fool)

Hey fool
In the hood bums sip malt liquor out of paper bags
Why I'm skatin' in the paper tags
Every nigga you roll with, they made of glass
'Round here niggas take your head off
Like a restaurant, they gon' pay the tab
And usually my breakin' point is when the fuck niggas start breakin' bad
Nigga countin' bank, tryna find a pussy I can surf on
I don't understand, why the feds take shit so personal?
If the spot ain't yours, who you work for?
Thirteen and he ready to get to work through
Drive by, hit the deck, shots, lick, then the whip swerve off
Murders only top, neighborhood is watchin'
I pray for my sins daily 'cause I know the Lord is watchin'
Ain't no threat, nigga, you playful
Been movin' work since grade school
Hey yo what the fuck this nigga just said? Huh?
