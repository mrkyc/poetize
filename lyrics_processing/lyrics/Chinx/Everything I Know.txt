Thing I know... 
We ain't finna talk though
Ehh ahh, ahhh

A hundred on the whip, ya' head got a price
Dogs won't sniff, if you put it in rice
Nigga went hard, wasn't over-night
Fake niggas gon' switch, real niggas tell the same story twice

Broke nigga might turn rich
Tell him everything I know (thing I know)
Nigga fuck round hit a lick
Tell him everything I know (thing I know)
Thing I know (thing I know)
Thing I know (thing I know)
Thing I know... Oh
Thing I know (thing I know)

Fake niggas gon' switch, real niggas tell the same story twice
Niggas wanna whip, they be thinkin ima lick, fuck nigga might lose your life
I know a couple niggas turn jelous
Blew your rent money on them fresh margiela's
Shawty bend it over know a nigga tryna nail it
Is you gon' snitch nigga? Ain't no tellin
Thing I know... know
Ridin on these lame niggas one eye closed
All red ready for the dia-blo
War strapped for everything I show
Woke up this morning and fell on the gold mine
Truth is I ain't even need a co-sign
Got liquour, got pills, got weed
Got bitches, got cribs, got cars and a whole nine
