It's the perfect time of year
Somewhere far away from here
I feel fine enough, I guess
Considering everything's a mess
There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk, but I'll just drive
It's colder than it looks outside
It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone then ya
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya
Try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time because the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile when ya
Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
Try to figure out what all this is for

It's the perfect time of day
To throw all your cares away
Put the sprinkler on the lawn
And run through with my gym shorts on
Take a drink right from the hose
And change into some drier clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Sleep away the afternoon

Pinch me, pinch me
Because I'm still asleep
Please God, tell me
That I'm still asleep

On an evening such as this
It's hard to tell if I exist
If I packed a car and leave this town
Who'll notice that I'm not around?
I could hide out under there
I just made you say "underwear"
I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway
