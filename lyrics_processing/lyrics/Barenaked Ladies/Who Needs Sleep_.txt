Now I lay me down not to sleep
I just get tangled in the sheets
I swim in sweat three inches deep
I just lay back and claim defeat

Chapter read and lesson learned
I turned the lights off while she burned
So while she's three hundred degrees
I throw the sheets off and I freeze

Lids down, I count sheep, I count heartbeats
The only thing that counts is that I won't sleep
I count down, I look around

Who needs sleep? Well, you're never gonna get it
Who needs sleep? Tell me, what's that for?
Who needs sleep? Be happy with what you're getting
There's a guy who's been awake since the Second World War
Who needs sleep? Well, you're never gonna get it
Who needs sleep? Tell me, what's that for?
Who needs sleep? Be happy with what you're getting
There's a guy who's been awake since the Second World War

My hands are locked up tight in fists
My mind is racing, filled with lists
Of things to do and things I've done
Another sleepless night's begun

Lids down, I count sheep, I count heartbeats
The only thing that counts is that I won't sleep
I count down, I look around

Who needs sleep? Well, you're never gonna get it
Who needs sleep? Tell me, what's that for?
Who needs sleep? Be happy with what you're getting

There's so much joy in life, so many pleasures all around
But the pleasure of insomnia is one I've never found
With all life has to offer, there's so much to be enjoyed
But the pleasures of insomnia are ones I can't avoid
Lids down, I count sheep, I count heartbeats
The only thing that counts is that I won't sleep
I count down, I look around (Holla holla holla)
