I tend the wheat field that makes your bread
I bind the sweet veal, pluck the hens that make your bed
Mother Nature & Mother Earth
Are two of three women who dictate what I'm worth

I'm the farmer
I work in the fields all day
Don't mean to alarm her
But I know it was meant to be this way

You cried a tear, I wiped it dry
I put you up upon a pedestal so high
If you should waver, if you should sway
I'd catch you, spread my tiny wings and fly away
You signed your picture with an O and X
I bet you don't write "love" each time you sign your checks

I'm the farmer
I work in the fields all day
Don't mean to alarm her
But I know we were meant to be this way

All of this corn I grow, I grow it all for you
I took a hatchet to the radio, I did it all for you
Well you could have written back
And you could have said "thank you"
But I guess you've got better things
But I guess you've got better things
But I guess you've got better things
Better things to do
Better things to do, yeah
Better things to do
Better things to do

You say you love me, is that the truth?
Although they've heard the songs, my friends need living proof
I know your address, I ring the bell
I bring you flowers and a .22 with shells

I'm the farmer
I work in the fields all day
It wasn't to harm her
But I know it was meant to be this way
But I know it was meant to be this way
