One day I will build a fountain, drink and never grow old
Then I'll market an elixir that will eliminate the common cold
Find your sickness on my list
Pay up front and make a wish

One day I will work with animals, all the tests I'm gonna do
All my stuff's completely natural, and when we're done we'll boil 'em down for glue
We can use to readhere
Your lips to mine if you were here

There's a lot I will never do (There's a lot)
Some fantastic, I know it's true
But none as much as my want to be with you

I can't stand to wait in line long, so I built a new machine
It just measures up the distance and then eliminates the folks between

One day I'll construct a satellite, and I'll name it after you
'Cause you were the greatest friend of all, except for when you split my lip in two
To see the look upon your face
As I launch you into space

There's a lot I will never do (There's a lot)
Some fantastic, I know it's true
But none as much as my want to be with you

Bye-bye, self-respect
I haven't had much of it since you left
I missed out on the best of you

Someday I will find the secret to your social chemistry
Then I'll print it on a T-shirt, and it'll make you want to be with me
And if I wear it past your work
You'll see other guys are jerks

Much like pheromones for flies
You will not avoid my eyes

There's a lot I will never do (There's a lot)
Some fantastic, I know it's true
But none as much as my want to be with you

Bye-bye, self-respect
I haven't had much of it since you left
I missed out on the best of you
Bye-bye, self-respect
I haven't had much of it since you left
I missed out on the best of you
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
