I was
I was
Raped at birth
I was
I was
I was
Brutalized by beastly girth
I was raped at birth!

When I was a boy
My life was destroyed
I was raped at birth
I was not overjoyed
When I was a man
I hid in the can
I was raped at birth
Yes, that was the plan
I went to my mom
She hit me with a pan
I was raped at birth!

Scumdog sex planet
Convulsing breeding hive
Spit forth the progeny
Through rivers of slime, I writhe
Seeking warmth and light
Life begins, the world so bright
Too soon from the womb I'm torn
As penis plums the newly born
See GWAR LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like
Mangled and tangled, I flop to the floor
Speckled and spackled, I run for the door
Though I'm but a baby, I'm still eight foot two
I'll be raped at birth for the pleasure of you
I was raped, yes, raped at birth

When I was a lad
Halfway out the womb
They ruined my rectum
I fucked half the room
Now I'm a man
But I won't grow up
If you rape me again
I think that I'll throw up
Fit me for a truss
With a times eight leather cup
I was raped at birth!

It went on for hours
Scalding hot, the golden showers
Manifesting pimple power
Penis-poking tingle-tower
Still, it seems unfair
One time, got raped with a chair
Still, good came of it
Like every time I shit
Mangled and tangled, I flop to the floor
Speckled and spackled, I run for the door
Though I'm but a baby, I'm still eight foot two
I'll be raped at birth for the pleasure of you
I was raped at birth!


My masters knew well why
They raped the newly born
The line at the door
Spoke of new forms of porn
I was raped at birth!

The wretched infants
Were sullen, forlorn
The skin, it was warm
We lived in a dorm
After we'd been raped, we were all given weapons
Your grave is my glory, your face I will step in
But I'm not complaining that my life is fucked
I was raped at birth, from then on, everything sucked
Everything sucked
Everything sucked
We are all raped at birth
It fucking hurts
Chased from room to room
Pinned in a corner
Bing bang boom!

Mangled and tangled, I flop to the floor
Speckled and spackled, I run for the door
Though I'm but a baby, I'm still eight foot two
I'll be raped at birth for the pleasure of you
