What grim vision this?
Bloodstained tomb
Beer-cans and piss
This
Is no life
For a god
Is this my fate?
Trapped for all time?
Is it too late?
The only thing worth living for
Escape!

I gaze through the night and behold constellations
Still bearing the scars of my disintegrations, ahh

So many hours
I wasted my powers
On murder and madness
And deadly red rain
Earth is a prison
This life, a curse
This planet's rotation
Is simply the worst
Days, they drag by
A life all too lost
I must escape
No matter what cost
Space, blazes infernal
My sentence on Earth, eternal
See GWAR LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like
It sickens me to watch you, all I ever do is cry
And do my best to kill you because all of you must die!
And although I created you
I always have hated you
Fuck this place!
Oh how I long for lust in space

So many years
Of bloodlust and tears
My struggles mean nothing
Ja, ja, all ist klar
Earth is a tomb
An abyss of time
I can't accept
It's the end of the line
The Scumdogs are calling
I must go back
If I can escape Earth
I swear I'll quit crack

Call-girls on comets, carnality that's felt
Dock your load-barge at the Garteroid belt
Bimbos in limbo awake with a "Boom!"
Revealing a teat twice the size of the moon
Uhn!

Lust!
In!
Space!
Lust!
In!
Space!
Fleischlust!
Auf!
Raum!
Lust!
In!
Space!
Uhn!

An outer-space orgy with freaks of all races
As bright orange cum spatters sluts with all faces
Meteoroided freakazoids, they exude prurience
Omni-sexuals display sodomic puissance
Lust!
In!
Space!
So many stars
So many bars
Outer space is quite the place
Even from afar
Out there I've humped millions
And felt no shame
Never excluded
The old or the lame
My sexploits were legend
I could have gone into porn
But I like killing more than sex
I always was a battle-borne

But space teems with dangers, the perils are countless
Enemies infinite, vengeance that's boundless
Wars that are so fun you don't want to win
Against the most hated Cardinal Syn!
Lust!
In!
Space!
Earth is a gallstone I'll leave far behind
A marble I garbled, never to find
Space blazes infernal
No interest in matters paternal
Lust!
In!
Space!
Hyperspace makes me horny and I don't know why
A zero-grav hard-on can make me so high
Space blazes infernal
My love for kinky sex, eternal

As we enter the black hole
Her nebula was crawling with crabs
White dwarf and black troll
