Welcome once again
To the Bloody Pit, my friends
We're so glad you could attend
Come and die, come and die
Yes, the Bloody Pit of Horror, here
As sick as is Gomorrah queer
It's purple purpose crinkly clear
Here!

I, I!
I, I!
I, I!
I lead the zombie army
They, they!
They are my sweetest slaves
These creatures
Well they shall never harm me
I saved them
From far beyond the grave

Lid on coffin cold
Return was foretold
Barrel, box, or bloody sack
Planted deep they still come back

Beneath the scroll of time
The zombies rise and curse the light
They curse the living and they bite
You find it alarming, I find it quite charming
They way the dead they explode from the ground
I found it amazing, the dead we were raising
And the stinking pile of bodies formed a molten nipple mound
I, I!
Your life is lost yet un-death
Found
The Bloody Pit of Horror
Has a bloody tale to tell
The Bloody Pit of holy shit
Oh motherfucking what the hell

I!
The Bloody Pit of Horror! (I!)

I, I!
I lead the zombie army
I, I!
I lead the zombie army
I, I!
I lead the zombie army
I, I!
They are my sweetest slaves
My sweetest slaves
The Zombie King
He walks alone
The Zombie King
He has no throne
Just a never-ending hunger
And a hole that can't be filled
By the centuries of victims
From the living he has killed
Who have all passed
Beneath the Earth
To transform into living dead
And swell his martial ranks
Who ever would've thought
You could teach them to drive tanks?
Drive tanks through banks
Zombies, March!

The Zombie King, he calls his troops
Der Krieg is coming soon
The filthy fiend stand wall-to-wall
And this is a big room!
The creatures of the underworld are an imposing bunch
But zombies are my sweetest slaves, as long as they get lunch
Vampires, they fucking suck
You know, because they're gay
Biker Werewolves, what a joke
They've sure seen better days
Zombie King don't give a damn cause he already rules
Even though his followers are nincompoops and boobs
