One thing that I know
That everywhere I fucking go
Life's a piece of shit with corpses
Rotting on there down below
And they all beg forgiveness
And so you know I will give them this
Ohh!

Living in the future now
You know I'm moving much too fast
I feel that I'm dying when I
Even when I'm living in the past
And you know this immortal coil
You know that it will always last
And now I think I'll have to sing
About the death and horror that I bring

Gay apparel
You put it on, put it on
Sucking the marrow
And as you die you sing this song
Oh! How shocking, how dare you
Dare to die before I'm through
Suppose I'll have to resurrect you
And bathe your bowels in boiling spew

Now it's time to...

I'm gazing at your broken form
Oh, I feel lost and so forlorn
Another death, another mess
Another shroud that I have worn
Another box that I begin
Another grave you'll soon be in
I concentrate this lovely hate, but
You're looking kinda thin
With much
Gay abandon

It's so obscene
King Queen
King Queen
It's so obscene!
Ahh!
Go!

Infinite ruin!
Man falls down
Look at me spewing
You begged me to come to this town
When your club's crushed and your friends are dead
Then you'll remember just-a what I said
I'm the queeniest being that there ever has been
Dare you tempt the wrath?
The wrath of old King Queen?
Now it's time, almost time
Now it's time to die!
When your club's crushed and your friends are dead
Then you'll remember just-a what I said
When your club's crushed and your friends are dead
Then you'll remember just-a what I said
I'm the queeniest being that there ever has been
Teeniest being that there ever has been
Queeniest being that there ever has been
Dare you tempt the wrath?
The wrath of old King Queen?
Crush you like bug
Smash steel and stone
Obliterate, dominate
Call this planet home
