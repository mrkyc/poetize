Don't give them a sword and then not let them use it
Or send them to war, and then make them lose it
This is a bomb, don't want to defuse it
Death is the answer, go on and choose it

(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
The lust for blood won't go away
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
It is the era of calamity
And I see this with perfect clarity
There never was an illusion of parity
I've got no time for your crippled Christ
See GWAR LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like
We have no need for your crippled Christ
And we never lacked for your advice
We don't have to hide our genocide
They'll fear us more when they know that we don't lie
It's gone beyond hatred this time
You love death, yet call it a crime
I twist the dagger that's deep in your guts
I'll put an end to it this time


On your knees
Pray!
It is your destiny
On your feet
Slay!
Obedience through slavery

Don't give them a sword and then not let them use it
Send them to war, and then make them lose it
This is a bomb, don't want to defuse it
Death is the answer, death is the answer!
Total control!
We own your soul!
No time for life
Time for the knife
Time for the sword
Fetus is cored!
Total mutation
Necro-mutilation
The perfect life form
Born for porn!

(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
The lust for blood won't go away
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
(Let us slay)
Let them slay, let them slay
We've got no time for your crippled Christ
And we never lacked for your advice
Lie after lie, lie, lie
I do believe it's almost time
The crippled Christ, the crippled Christ
(The crippled Christ, the crippled Christ
The crippled Christ, the crippled Christ)
I do believe it's almost time (Christus)
You're always calling for a sacrifice
And the body count is very nice
Lie after lie, lie, lie, lie
I do believe it's time to die
