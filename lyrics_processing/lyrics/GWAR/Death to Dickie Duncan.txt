Don't know what to feed the kids?
Do their eyes look sad and sunken?
They will surely flip their lids
If you bring 'em to Dickie Duncan!

Who's the one that you're craving
In the middle of the night?
Yeah, sure he's bad for you
But he feels so right
So ladies and gentlemen
Without further ado
Let me introduce to you
In his hideous debut...
(Dickiiiiie Duncan!)

Yeeaaah
Hahahahaha!
Hey there, kiddies!
Yeeaaaah
It's time to have some fun!

I am the one
Who's gonna feed you
Murder on a bun
I am the one
Who won't stop
Until you weigh a ton
Obese, corn-fed and deep fried!

All I fucking do is eat and shit all day
Yeeaaaah
Feed poison to the kids so that I can get paid

I beg your pardon
Got you shartin' your garments
I'm lovin' it, my oven mitts
Are serving up garbage
I'm the mascot, makes you pass out
In a park full of perverts
And burgers made of murder
Served by suicidal servers

Yeeaaah
All I fucking do is eat and shit all day
Yeeaaaah
Feed poison to the kids so that I can get paid
Yeeaaah
All I fucking do is eat and shit all day
Yeeaaaah
I'll cover your face with my mayonnaise!

Killing little piggies
On the production line
Grind them to sludge to make
The slop on which you dine
I am the one
Who's busy making
All the brats so fat
I am the one
Who's got them loving
Nuggets made from rat

Yeeaaah
All I fucking do is eat and shit all day
Yeeaaaah
Feed poison to the kids so that I can get laid
Yeeaaah
All I fucking do is eat and shit all day
Yeeaaaah
