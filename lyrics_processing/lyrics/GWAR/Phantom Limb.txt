You were a slave
I'm a slave too
We all do
What the master
Tells us to do
The hammer so heavy
The work is so hard
The chains that bound us together
Left us all scarred
The burden is greater
Since we lost your voice
Still they hate us
As if we have a choice
It's not about money
It's not about fame
We can never stop
Gotta do it again and again

Will we ever kill again?
Shed the blood of men
I can feel you
Like a phantom limb
Will you ever scream again?
Your battle hymn
I can feel you
Like a phantom limb

You were a soldier
I'm a soldier too
We committed crimes
Like soldiers do
Now I fight on
In dark mail you're clad
But why can't they see you?
My pale comrade
I hear their voices
How dare I speak?
I have no choice
So hoarse and so weak
Alone in the spotlight
Your shadow is long
All the way to the grave
The halls echo with your songs

Will we ever kill again?
Spill the blood of men
I can feel you
Like a phantom limb
Will you ever scream again?
Your battle hymn
I can feel you
Like a phantom limb
The road is long and the road is hard
On a monster in a band
But the toll it took was so much more
Than we had ever planned
The world has never looked so dark
The pain has never felt so bad
Is it wrong to try to go on
When it's all we ever had

Will you ever rise again?
Lights growing dim
I can feel you
Like a phantom limb
Will I ever laugh again?
World looks so grim
I can feel you
