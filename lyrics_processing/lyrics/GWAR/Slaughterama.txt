With a battle cry go forth, which is "Give the people what they want"; and what the people want could only be the senseless slaughter of the gutter-slime that litters this nation for cash and prizes. Yes, this is the show where people bet their lives to win something big. Cause when your life is shit, then you haven't got much to lose on: Slaughterama!

This next geek is guilty of the following:
A Grateful Dead life in which he's been wallowing
Tried to tell us "Give peace a chance"
Met the National Guard and you shit in your pants
It's not your imagination, it's not a bad trippie
Yes that's him, it's the big smelly hippie!

Hello, Mr. Hippie, nice to meet ya. Hey, got a little shit between your toes. So how're things at the old manure factory? How's little Tofu? What, she grew another head?! Well, you gotta lay off that LSD, y'know? Kinda makes your offspring goofy-looking...
So, how do you hide money from a hippie?
Put it under the soap!
I'm sorry, but that answer wasn't in time! You're gonna have to put your mouth on this! Whoa! I blew your head clean off! Good thing I was such an expert shot with the National Guard back at Kent State. I bagged 4 that day. There's nothing like hippie hunting. My dad always used to take me along with Lee Harvey Oswald. (Hooray!)
Alright, we're rockin' now!

World's biggest hair, world's tightest pants
Got no circulation but you still can't dance
Fashion is a statement, sometimes a risk
Every fashion had its faults, but your's is the pits
Always in black, looks like he's dead
Here's the art-fag lying on his deathbed!

Hello, Mr. Art-Fag, come on out here! Say, what a hairdo! Why, it's awfully big! As big as the... the... the Hindenburg, and it'd probably go up just as fast if I put this lighter to it. But no, I'm gonna hold out and ask you this question:
What ever happened to Eddie Munster?
I'm looking at him!
Oh! Oderus! Help the boy with his hairdo there. Ooh, it's gettin' ripped off! (Oh no!) Ow, you know that's gotta hurt! Hey, what's Oderus trying to do with his face? Is that a face-lift? Whoa, he's pulled that face clean off! Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! (Hooray!)
Help that sod outta here!

Gave up pussy, stopped doing toot
Now you can't wait to give someone the boot
Elbows and knuckles, all you know how
Follow the herd, just another cow
Brain full of shit, boots full of lead
Straight from Hitler's ass, here's the Nazi skinhead!
 (Sieg Heil! Heil!)

Hello, Mr. Nazi Skinhead! How you doing? How's Geraldo's nose? Still broken? Well it's good to see you still on the job. You know, when you're mugging talk show commentators in bathrooms, always remember to draw those swastikas turning to the right. Not to the left, always to the right.
Hey, why do Nazi skinheads wear red suspenders, anyways?
He doesn't have to tell you!
Time to give this Nazi skinhead one more haircut, real close to the shoulders-like. Whoa! His head's been decapitated! Look at all that PSI in his aorta artery. Whoa! Is he a gusher or what? Ahahahahahahahaha! (Hooray!)
Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's all for this week. We've killed everybody that's worth killing, hope you do the same
