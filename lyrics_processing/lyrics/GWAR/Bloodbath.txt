Well I saw the thing that no one should see
As I became the thing that no one should see
I became lost inside my mind
Happens all the time!
I saw a dead body on the side of the road
I saw a dead body on the side of the road
I saw a dead body on the side of the road
I saw a dead body on the side of the road

Well I saw a dead body on the side of the road
The dogs were gnawing on his face
Then out of the blue, some homeless dude
Came hurtling through space
He had the most satisfied expression on his face
As if to say "In this last moment, I am truly free!"
Then the dude exploded on the street
Right in front of me (Uhn!)

Get up!
Think fast!
Gonna be!
A bloodbath!
Cause you get one shot and you get one time
And if you feel like starting fires, well, I do it all the time
All my life is filled with death, it's everything I see
My mind's a muddy mess of jenkum, crack, and PCP
But death is just another foe, I fight them all the time
They gonna get me one day, before then, I'm gon' get mine
Agh!

Here's a creature wracked in pain
Watch the creature go insane
See the life go down the drain
He was one of the two, not just one of the few
He usually knew exactly what to do
Now he has left for the stars!
He has left us to play bars
Uhn!

Get up!
Think fast!
Coming soon!
Bloodbath!
Cause you get one shot and you get one time
And if you feel like starting fires, well, I do it all the time
All my life is filled with death, it's everything I see
My mind's a muddy mess of jenkum, crack, and PCP
But death is just another foe, I fight them all the time
They gonna get me one day, before then, I'm gon' get mine
Ah-ooh-ah!
