I met her at a donkey show, she was
Minutes past 13
Suckin' on a cherry Yoo-hoo, readin'
Nugget Magazine
Cum-spattered tube-top
Scrawny pre-pube tits
That's when I saw she was a
Quadruple-chick

And I said, "Baby, you're looking good"
That's when I noticed her legs were wood
I grabbed a stump
And dragged her out the door
I need a hole, I don't need no hips
I laid a line of coke on her tits
That's when I ripped off
Her dirty shit-filled drawers

Good
Should
Could
I think it feels pretty
Good

I think it feels pretty
Good, so good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good, so good
So good
So good
So good
Heh!

It wasn't nothing pretty
She took my genital germ
Her limbless body thrashed about, filled with
Infected sperm
I criss-crossed with my cable
I smashed her face through a door
They found her in a plastic bag down by
Highway 64

And I said, "Baby, you're looking good"
That's when I saw that her legs were wood
I know you people
That you just don't understand
I need a hole, I don't need no hips
I need the taste of dick on my lips
I fucked her asshole with a
A piece of frozen shit
And I say...

"How you feel now, baby?"
Rock and roll never felt so...
