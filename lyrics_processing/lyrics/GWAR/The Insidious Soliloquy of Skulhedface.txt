I'm delighted
You've inquired
Who the hell I am
Allow me to elucidate
Perhaps pontificate
Upon the state of my most
Great and perfect plan

I am he who has been him back when man
Swam Pangean seas as aquatic apes
I am he who has been her
As she once bled the world
With the words of psychotic fate
While GWAR slept, I kept their minds content
To give their flesh consent
To my everloving seed
Undying research has given to death, rebirth
The tools of urban science to fight
Most faceless enemies

Who do you think you're up against
Some chaotic stupidity?
I'll show you conflict management by my extensive
Supergeniosity

(The Homogenizer)
It studies the species Bohab
(Homo cum sum a tor)
What is it that makes the ideal man?
Bravado? Machismo?
Is it something secreted from a gland?
It's called Jizmoglobin
If death to you is a bore
And life is just so slack
Consider becoming a whore
To the lesson of the past

The end of all time after time after time
Has left the world wanting for new hopes and fears
Well I have produced a new product line
With cryptic truth too horrible to hear
We've got the guts to face Skulhed
We've got the guts to face Skulhed
We've got the guts...
Words that healed, legends that have taught
Oral traditions both fought for and lost
Secrets of success, shouts filled with hate
Documents declaring freedoms of state
I bleed humanity, figurines of history
I weave tragedy in tapestries of infamy
But I can't deny it always was such
Oh no, nada, nein, non, nyet, nix, not!
Pathetically beautiful I was once then
Ruled peaceful planets, sublime
Before sin

It's so easy to not see
The obvious enemy
To put your problems on
I've been sick of it all along
And now the ultimate morph
Into powers that will dwarf
The sum of every nation
And all known information
If you can't stand it the way I have planned it
I'll export you off the Earth, sell ya for all you're worth
Your enemy will have a face, traitor of the human race
As you're shipped off to the innermost reaches of outer space
Ahh, yes! The best I possibly can be
Applause for me
The insidiously "live" spelled backwards
Mister, Doctor, Professor!
