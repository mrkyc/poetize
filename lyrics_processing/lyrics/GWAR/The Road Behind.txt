Well I'm travelin' down the road
And I'm carrying that heavy load
I stagger 'round in a stupor
Sleazy, I can't do the show
I'm hangin' out backstage
I'm in a homicidal rage
I signed a million dollar contract
I puked on every page
Slaughtered half the crew
'Cause they ate my deli tray
Oh baby hey
I said I'd do the show
And I canceled anyway

You were a road kill baby
'Til I scraped you in my arms
Just another wattle flapping
On the old turkey farm
So baby

While the wheels keep rolling
And another milepost gone
All along on the road behind
Oh can't you hear me calling
Just like the sad whale song
I'm on that road behind
See GWAR LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like
Well there you have it, baby
I'm just a sensitive guy
Y'know I snuffed a million planets
But I still find time to cry
Because there's more to life
Than making other people die
Like a little bloody tear baby
Running out my dirty little eye
And some things, baby
They don't make no sense
Does it really matter if it bugs your parents?

You're a road kill baby
I scraped you in my arms, ow!
'Nother wattle flappin'
On the old turkey farm
So baby
Baby, quit your crying
Put them clown britches on

While the wheels keep rolling
And another milepost gone
All along on the road behind
Oh can't you hear me calling
Just like the sad whale song
I'm on that road behind
Oh yeah!


While the wheels keep rolling
And another milepost gone
All along on the road behind
Oh can't you hear me calling
Just like the sad whale song
I'm on that road behind
While the wheels keep rolling
And another milepost gone
All along on the road behind

Well the wheels keep rolling
And another signpost gone
Baby, can't you hear me calling
Like a sad whale song
Like a sad whale song
