I'm
The fucking Whargoul
I'm
The ghost of Minas Morgul
I destroyed your life
I raped your wife
I am Whargoul
I am uncool
I am Whargoul
I've been many faces, been many names
Known love and hate until they were the same
I bring ruin
I am Whargoul
Am I human?
They think that they know what I know
They think they know what's best
I think that's why they killed me
That's why I joined the SS

They used a blowtorch on me
Nice try
Whargoul cannot die
Cannot, will not die
You blow off my arm, I laugh at the pain
And after the battle, I feast on the slain
Seeking my creator, taking from the strong
Yes, you see I need your strength, so I can kill the wrong
Seeking my creator, taking from the weak
Yes, you see I need you, so I can snuff the meek
Savor the silence (Whargoul)
Savor the silence (Whargoul)
Savor the silence (Whargoul)
Addicted to violence
Savor the silence (Whargoul)
Savor the silence, Whargoul
Savor the silence (Whargoul)
Savor the silence, Whargoul
Savor the silence (Whargoul)
Savor the silence (Whargoul)
Savor the silence (Whargoul)
Addicted to violence
They used a bulldozer
To run my ass over
Arms to the sky
40,000 died, but I survived
I don't care which flag that I choose
I don't care if I win or lose
I don't care if you have to die
Just fight without a side
Never say die!
Stalingrad, '42
Became a living tomb
Yes, human souls
Profit for the prophet and the creatures who control
'46, I got away
From the horrid thing that I did at Malmedy
And though I gained strength at the time
Still they call for vengeance for the hatred of my crime
I tried to drink myself to death
40 years went by, and drunken I was left
And drunk I was when they caught me
Gagged and bagged was right where they got me
Tied to a chair, feeling sore
Knowing all the answers to the question I ignore
They burned off my face with a propane torch
Then they blew up my porch
Then I fought against the USA
Trapped in a trench 'til the bulldozer came
Changed sides, and flew the bloody warthog
Highway of Death and the day of the dog
Once again, I died alive
Sent home in a box but somehow I survived
Maybe you've got my face
