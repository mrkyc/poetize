I'm in love, I'm in love with a dog named Pookie
Pookie, Pookie, Pookie, Pookie, Pookie

Now the old is new
Now that one and one is two
I think of thee and start to spew
I don't wanna cum inside of you

Now I touch your lips
Now I mount your hips
Now I read your mind
Your slimy hind, sublime!

I'm feeling the peeling, mind reeling
I race unto the plague
I'll bring you a big coat of butter
To slick your dead dick way
I'm in love with a dead dog

Paw in fist, we stalk through the
Rutabaga garden
We've been to the clinic
We know our love is clean
See GWAR LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like
We're walking together but
We fill up separately
We share a cheese ball
We just do it all

The butter so bitter, the shitter
Well it gapes vacantly
The higher the litter, the shitter
Has justly righted three

Oh, you are such a little cutie. Come here, let me take you for a pull down the stairs. Okay, Pookie, let's go for a little walk outside, you little rascal. I just love your matted fur. You're looking so nice today! Okay, come on, down the driveway. Oh look, it's a beautiful day! Looks like acid rain. Oh, look, it's Mrs. Morgan, hung her up on the fence three days ago, isn't she a cutie? Ha ha ha. Oh, oh Pookie, Pookie look out! Don't get too close to the road, Pookie! Oh Pookie, don't let me pick you up and throw you into the road, uh-oh Pookie! Oh my God! Pookie look out for that gigantic, uncontrollable, whirling death machine! Oh no!

You begin to bore me
With your breath like rubber
You scream, "Don't stop"
I hope you don't pop
