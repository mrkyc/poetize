I want to kill the president and I don't need a gun
I want to fuck the government, I want to fuck a nun
I want to paint the world in blood and pave the streets in bone
The killing won't come to an end until I take the throne
Just stop and smell the decay
Of what you've given your life to build
Your struggle was always in vain
Your dreams have been killed
You underestimate our influence
Cursed by addiction to your affluence

 There's a simple reason why your country's crying out in pain
 You've ignored your neighbor now your house is going up in flames
 Imbeciles all showed us when they squeezed into the voting booths
 America should be afraid of television, wars, and truth
 You will serve them no more
El Presidente and his whore
They will die by my sword
All will bow

I step from behind the curtain
Let them know who's pulling the strings
The transition might be quite painful
But I promise, you won't feel a thing
Who do you think causes famines and wars?
It's those same leaders you've been dying for

 There's a simple reason why your country's crying out in pain
 You've ignored your neighbor now your house is going up in flames
 Imbeciles all showed us when they squeezed into the voting booths
 America should be afraid of television, wars, and truth
 Teleport into his office all the way from outer space
 He won't know it's happened 'til I'm tearing off his stupid face
 Did you think this sword and battle axe I have are just for show?
 Not only will I use them, I'll revel as the kill count grows
 You will serve them no more
El Presidente and his whore
They will die by my sword
All will bow
Before GWAR
