Invade your planet from outer space
Invade your planet to tear off your face
Invade your planet to enslave your race
No matter what creed, color, or caste

Track, trap, train
Scumdog slaves!

Bonesnapper

Where I was born!
Scumdog slaveship!
I would take them there
Scumdog slaveship!
Waiting in the air
Shipped in containers to the torture planet
Where I was born!
I would take them there
Scumdog slaveship!
In the atmosphere
I am not a turtle!
What are you looking at?
It's not easy being green!

Churning bodies with a roaring engine

Burning in the air
Scumdog slave world!
Has no atmosphere
Nobody likes me anyway!
It's not easy being green!

In the years before I was caught by GWAR
I was an evil troll with a lust for more
Caught in the bowels of the Pyramid tomb
Nowhere to run
Doom!
Wereboth, the wizard
Marrowsucker, my friend
Both killed by foes, led to my end
At night, we would fight
And drink impaled ale
By the burning corpse light
From planet to planet
From war to war
We enslave and conquer
Worlds by the score
The battle, campaign
Operation, the tour
Scumdogs need Slaves
More, more, more, more
My resume inspired
GWAR said "You're hired"
The battle with Syn is gonna be a riot
We raged in space
Destroyed the wrong place
So the Master banished us with no trace
Then we fell to Earth
And for what it's worth
No one remembers me
Since our rebirth
When it gets real gory
GWAR gets the glory
I get the blame
Fuckin' end of story!
