And we begin our litany
Of peopled killed by mostly me
Goatie the load, he's first in line
Antarctic Ant not far behind
Ripped an arm off Melvin Fleebish
Mutant cockroach, not for squeamish
Uncle Knobby, crushed by engine
Pretty Pookie, anus bending
Anton Reemcob, he exploded
Redneck got his chest imploded
Biker Bitch, she was de-titted
Stubbles, on a pike was spitted
Cranial crush the Franken-Ref
Ollie North was kicked to death
Smashed flat was the Mutant Baby
Smalsac had to join the Navy

The litany of the vanquished
The litany of the slain
You know their names will someday vanish
Enshrined in death they shall remain

Mr. Fudgie, death came quickly
Mrs. Fudgie, slow and sickly
Mangled spleen of Noriega
Log Suckoff, yeah we betrayed ya
Crucified the Oral Swallow
Bested Techno, threats were hollow
Bozo waged his mortal combat
Edna Granbo, raped with wombat
