There's a place
So very far
Most favored of the worlds that are missed by GWAR
We can get there
As long as it's by stolen car
Smash your face and go shoot up!
Uhn!

There's a world
Of which I've heard
Far beyond the sky
A place of chicks and pills and booze
A place where winners always lose
You'll always hear your favorite band
Here in Metal Metal Land!

Here in Metal Metal Land
Nothing ever dies
Except of course our enemies
And they're attracting metal flies
Here in Metal Metal Land
Everything is loud!
All the chicks are strippers
All their fathers, proud

Here in Metal Metal Land
Every day is night
Except of course when night is day
But then there is no light
Here in Metal Metal Land
Everything is rock
Everyone is in a band
Every girl
Sucks every cock
Here in Metal Metal Land
Everything is hard
Except of course the test you take
To get a license for your car
B-B-B-Bullet belts and denim jackets
Crystal meth in tiny packets
Witches, warlocks, demon seed
Booze and cooze and weed and speed

Filthy hair and dirty faces
Flying Vs and swords and maces
80s hair bands are still hated
No false metal tolerated!
Heavy metal is the law
Weakness means a broken jaw
Everything is loud and fast
Metal up your fucking ass!
Metal plane on metal trip
Metal hand, metal grip
It's metal, man...
