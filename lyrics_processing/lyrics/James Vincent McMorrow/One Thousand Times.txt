I don't want to live without your love
I had let it go to waste
But I don't want to live without your love
Drag it to an open window
Shred it in a million pieces
I don't want to live without your love
Funny how we do without everything we trade away
Only in November when it's cold do we miss the warmth
Every wound ever opened
Every man to ever see you
You should take advantage of the summer

Cause if you're alone, if you're alone
How can I save you?
I find a way to make your love more complicated
What if I could change, if I could change if you could save me?
Still find a way to miss a thousand times

I don't want to live without your love
Oh, oh
I tell you what you want to hear if
What you want is incomplete
I don't want to live without your love
I don't mind how much it changes
I can look the other way
I still remember how it felt to be crushed by something
Walk until you see the water
Just in case it disappears
You might also likeYou should take advantage of the summer

Cause if you're alone, if you're alone
How can I save you?
I find a way to make your love more complicated
What if I could change, if I could change if you could save me?
Still find a way to miss a thousand times

And I would just sit in my car
Listening to distant alarms go
They seem far, so far, so
Feeling the weight of the world
Nothing compared to the long road
That seems hard, so hard, so
And I would just sit in my car
