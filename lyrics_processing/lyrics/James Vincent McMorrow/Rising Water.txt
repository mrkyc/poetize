Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh oh oh

We're in it now, everybody knows
What I've become
Truth is I never once was sad
For what I've done
It's like a game where everybody dies
And has no fun
Still I want to play even if I end
Back where I've begun

Because you make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
Because you make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
You might also like
Ooh, ooh
Mile from nowhere

Ooh, ooh
Mile from nowhere
Ooh, ooh
Oh oh oh

What happens now?
It's your lucky day
It's your lucky day
So write it down
Guess we're gone astray
Guess we're gone astray
I wish I cried
It's your lucky day
It's your lucky day
It wasn't mine
Guess we're gone astray
Guess we're gone astray

Because you make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
Because you make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
Ooh, ooh
Mile from nowhere
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Mile from nowhere
Ooh, ooh
Oh oh oh

When I wake, realize you were gone
So I sat at the edge of the lawn
Days go by, still no sign of your ghost
Never call, never write, it's a loss

Because you make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
Because you make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
You make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
Because you make me feel alive
In spite of rising water
Abandoning my car
About a mile from nowhere
Ooh, ooh
Mile from nowhere
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Mile from nowhere
Ooh, ooh
Oh oh oh

Mile from nowhere
Mile from nowhere
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
