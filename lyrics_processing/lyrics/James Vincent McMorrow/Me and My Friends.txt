I think you're the best (The best)
Are we? (Are we?)
It's so hard to tell when nobody's breathing
Holding your chest (Your chest)
Until we (Until we)
Get so tired that we forget what we're raising
I know that you're right (You're right)
Every time (Every time)
But I fight it 'cause that's just what I'm like
I think we're the best (The best)
Should we? (Should we?)
Leave at 5am when everyone's sleeping?

And I caught up to your taxi
Glad I caught up to you
Glad that you would let me
I went up to your bedroom
We were joking how you wish you'd never met me

When I was five, I talked too much
When I was ten, I think I started losing my touch
Another reason that you'll never find me
I come home every night, it's just me and my friends
Me and my friends, me and my friends
It's just me and my friends
Me and my friends, me and my friends

I'm loving our days in LA
You get so excited when we sit in the shade, yeah
Then I forget to pay for our drinks
Next thing you know, I'm up and running away, yeah
Balloon pops overhead, are we dead?
You just get me like I'm something you read
I'm loving our days in LA
Let's check our auras while we wait for our change

And I caught up to your taxi
Glad I caught up to you
Glad that you would let me
I went up to your bedroom
We were joking how you wish you'd never met me

When I was five, I talked too much
Then I was ten, I think I started losing my touch
Another reason that you'll never find me
I come home every night, it's just me and my friends
Me and my friends, me and my friends
It's just me and my friends
Me and my friends, me and my friends
Is it the time, is it the time to be okay?
'Cause I'm thinking that it should be the time
Is it the time to be okay?
Yeah

When I was five, I talked too much
When I was ten, I think I started losing my touch
Another reason that you'll never find me
I come home every night, it's just me and my friends
Me and my friends, me and my friends
It's just me and my friends
Me and my friends, me and my friends

It's just me and my friends
Me and my friends, me and my friends
It's just me and my friends
