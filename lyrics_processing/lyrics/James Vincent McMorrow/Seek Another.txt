I have seen some terrible things
There's a waterfall
Quite place where trouble can spring
Everybody goes
Throws themselves from the top of the stream
So don't go out alone
'Cause I have seen some terrible things
Who built the wall that reached the sea?
(Seek another)
Who placed 'em here beneath my feet?
(Seek another)
Who better here for you than me?
(Seek another)
You let me come, I let you lead
(Seek another)
Open my lungs, you need to be
(Seek another)
Deep in my chest disrupting me
(Seek another)
What happens after courage leaves
(Seek another)
Back to our horses, back to sleep
(Seek another)

'Cause I have seen this happen before
Where creatures think they're grown
Creatures think they'll scratch at your door
But theres another world
A purple wave collapse on a shore
So don't go out alone
'Cause i have seen this happen before
Who built the wall that reached the sea?
(Seek another)
Who placed 'em here beneath my feet?
(Seek another)
Who better here for you than me?
(Seek another)
You let me come, I let you lead
(Seek another)
Open my lungs, you need to be
(Seek another)
Deep in my chest disrupting me
(Seek another)
What happens after courage leaves
(Seek another)
Back to our horses, back to sleep
(Seek another)
There's a diamond ahead
And I can't feel my legs
Check the pulse in my neck
'Cause there's a diamond ahead
There's a diamond...
Send a car round 8
Always trying to be late
Now i can't look away
'Cause theres a diamond ahead
Theres a diamond ahead
Who built the wall that reached the sea?
(Seek another)
Who placed 'em here beneath my feet?
(Seek another)
Who better here for you than me?
(Seek another)
You let me come, I let you lead
(Seek another)
Open my lungs, you need to be
(Seek another)
Deep in my chest disrupting me
(Seek another)
What happens after courage leaves
(Seek another)
Back to our horses, back to sleep
(Seek another)
