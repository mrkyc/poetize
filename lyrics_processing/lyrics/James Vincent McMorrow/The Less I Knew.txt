A beating heart gets thrown out of a car in the dark
I find it and I check it for scars and make sure it's clean
Then I go back inside
'Cause there's nothing for us here in the night
Just a helicopter buzzing nearby, ruining my sleep

And I can feel a strong vibration when I look at you, you
Everybody knows my failures, well I know theirs too, too

Is this what it takes?
What it takes to be impossibly great?
'Cause if it is then I think maybe the less, the less
The less I knew the better
Please just be kind when I drag myself out on through the line
'Cause in the end I think that maybe the less, the less
The less I knew the better

Now that heart and me
At first we get on so splendidly
And we called you but you never seemed free
So we just drove around for a while
But then the poetry of silence
It has this way of catching me and that heart
And it rises to tell us that all of this is grief and everything we love is a shame
You might also like
So I open up my window and I throw that heart through, through
Now everybody knows my failures, well I know theirs too, too

So is this what it takes?
What it takes to be supposedly great?
'Cause if it is then I think maybe the less, the less
The less I knew the better
Please just be kind when I drag myself out onto the night
'Cause in the end I think that maybe the less, the less
The less I knew the better
The less I knew the better

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
