(This ain't so hard)
(These are just ordinary times)
(Everything is fine)
(And nobody calls)
(This ain't so hard)
(These are just ordinary times)
(Everything is fine)

I saw you out
Take off some clothes
Say something real
Make it real
Cause you're the best
Instinct, I know
Just keep it going
You're the best
Staying at home, listening to feeling
You turn it up in your mother's basement
Trying to hold the cup
Shallow lights surrounding me
Wander off
You swing in my direction later
Thats close enough
You might also like
I swear to god, I'd run for you
You'd find me waiting
And we'd start over
It sounds so easy
Cause it's the last story we'll ever read
So let's start over
It sounds so easy

I was young
Sleeping outdoors, listening to demons
I was young
Maybe twice, I picked a fight just to be violent
Maybe twice, I slept inside
I touched the ceiling
I wanna leave
I still believe it's possible for us to be
Be the type to hear that ringing
And both agree, agree we liked it better before i started singing

I swear to god, I'd run for you
You'd find me waiting
And we'd start over
It sounds so easy
Cause it's the last story we'll ever read
So let's start over
It sounds so easy
When will I notice, the light come creeping
When will I notice, the lies come creeping

I'd run for you
You'd find me waiting
And we'd start over
It sounds so easy
Cause it's the last story we'll ever read
So let's start over
It sounds so easy
I'd run for you
You'd find me waiting
And we'd start over
It sounds so easy
Cause it's the last story we'll ever read
So let's start over
It sounds so easy

I'd run for you
You'd find me waiting
And we'd start over
It sounds so easy
Cause it's the last story we'll ever read
So let's start over
