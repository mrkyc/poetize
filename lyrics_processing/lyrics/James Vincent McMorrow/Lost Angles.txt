You feel the pressure in your bones
It's resonating
Trying to conceal it
And you call me
You waited by the phone for hours
Thinking maybe do I manipulate you?
Have you suffered? Have you suffered with the words of every goddamn asshole out here on the weekend
Can you feel it, you feel it in your bones
That something else can matter just as much as breathing
Who am I to own you?
Who am I to own you?
Who am I to own you?
Who am I to own you?
Who am I to own you?
Who am I to own you?
Who am I to own you?
What you wanna be this time?
You can be a wolf one day
Just howling away
Don't you look at me though
Cause I'm fine
I would never hurt you, wait
You're how I get through it

Is it better to live your life in shallow water or risk failure drowning in the deep end?
So you fear it, you fear that every move you make is just a hammer
You are just a nail, but you're not
Don't let fear control you
Don't let fear control you
Don't let fear control you
Don't let fear control you
Don't let fear control you
Don't let fear control you
Don't let fear control you
What you wanna be this time?
You can be a wolf one day
Just howling away
Don't you look at me, though
Cause I'm fine
I would never hurt you, wait
You're how I get through
You're right
So right
So wide awake
You're how I get through

You're how I get through
What you wanna be this time?
You can be a wolf one day
Just howling away
