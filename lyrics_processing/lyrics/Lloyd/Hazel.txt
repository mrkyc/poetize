(This is a J. Lack track)
Hey, oh yeah

I can remember when I met you
You had all of my homies talking 'bout you
And I thought it'd be cool if I got at you
So we can spend a little time
I can get to know you, tell me your name
I'm beginning to see the more we hang together
Baby girl, I like you 'cause you're better
Than any average chick
That I was rollin' with
I knew it was love at first sight
I never met a girl like you before
I can count on you whenever I need to take it slow
And you'll be taking me up-up and away we go
You got my eyes so low where they damn near closed

And hey Hazel, I like you
Can't see myself without you
My sweet Hazel
'Cause I think I'm in love, I'm in love
Ay Hazel, I like you
Can't see myself without you
My sweet Hazel
Girl, I think I'm in love, I'm in love
See Lloyd LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
There be times people be telling me to let you go
But the bond I got with you is stronger than they even know
And just to prove it to you girl, you know I love you so much
I hit the corner store for you and scrape the guts out a Dutch
It's like the things you say to me when I'm feeling hurt
You pick me up when I go through it, that's why I put you first
When everybody be only constantly stressing me worse
You the one that I come running to to ease my nerves
And I never met a girl like you before
I can count on you whenever I need to take it slow
And you be taking me up-up and away we go
You got my eyes so low where they damn near closed

And hey Hazel, I like you
Can't see myself without you
My sweet Hazel
'Cause I think I'm in love, I'm in love
Ay Hazel, I like you
Can't see myself without you
My sweet Hazel
Girl, I think I'm in love, I'm in love

Girl, come here
Let me take a look at them purple highlights in your hair
That's crazy
You know, usually I'd share you with my homies
But... I think I'mma keep you all to myself, ya dig?
Yeah
Ay Hazel, I like you
Can't see myself without you
My sweet Hazel
'Cause I think I'm in love, I'm in love
Ay Hazel, I like you
Can't see myself without you
My sweet Hazel
Girl, I think I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Hey Hazel, I like you
Can't see myself without you
My sweet Hazel
'Cause I think I'm in love, I'm in love
Ay Hazel, I like you
Can't see myself without you
My sweet Hazel
