Da da da da da da da, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh baby
Ah, ooh, ah, yeah, oh ooh

I'm writing you a letter
To let you know what's on my mind
Shawty, I can love you better
Promise I won't waste your time
I think we should be together
If you agree, show me a sign
Come give me a piece of heaven
Girl, you opened up my eyes

You opened up my eyes
To the other side of love
I've been waiting all my life
Could she be the one for me? (For me)

I know you've got another
But baby he don't do you right
I can be your secret lover
Stay with you all through the night
All I'm asking, girl, is try me
Come with me, I'll change your life
Show you things you've never seen, girl
I can open up your eyes

Seems I can't get enough

Could she be the one for me? (For me)
You opened up my eyes

Now I just wanna love you down
Oh, I'm so happy when your loves around
My life's better when you're closest
Feels like I'm above the clouds
And no, there's no telling if I'll touch the ground
(Telling if I'll touch the ground)
I have no cares, on air, I'm floating (Floating)

You opened up my eyes
To the other side of love
I've been waiting all my life
Seems I can't get enough
'Cause girl you're so fly
Could she be the one for me? (For me)
