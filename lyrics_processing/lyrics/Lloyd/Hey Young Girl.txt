See you have now been approached by a playa
But baby i won't play ya, lets have a conversation
Like, Iz you in school baby

Ain't got alot of time so i ain't tryin to chase ya
Just store it in the memory of my 3 way pager (Oooh)

Adernaline rush like whoo
Can't explain what I wanna do to ya

(Chorus x2)
(Breakdown 1:)
I know you ain't use to a country boy like me
But what you said would not replace
Shawty you will see
There's no place in the world that's quite like the dirty south
So give me your information so we can work it out
Dirty South
Work It Out
(Chorus x2)
(Breakdown 2:)
See shawty got flavor like a peach lifesaver
Won't you come down to the studio later?
Kyle can rhyme keep the beat tight, we can chill underneath the street light
She's from the south so she's fine, and classy
Skin is smooth and she's never ashy
Roll her dro, gotcha fresh and clean and In the Coupe Deville gangsta leanin'
Hey Young Girl
