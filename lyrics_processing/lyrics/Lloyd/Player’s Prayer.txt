Oh oh
Oh
Yea

Thou shall not run these streets
Thou shall not hit these clubs
Every night of the week lookin for some groupie love
Thou shall respect your heart
Thou shall not play you hard
But I did
I was wrong and I'm hating it

Cause now I'm calling ya cell phone
Over and over
My high is gone
But I don't wanna be sober
I'm feeling sick and I ain't got the flu
Girl I'm missing you

Girl I'm on my knees (knees)
I promise I'll be good
And I will never do it again (again)
On my knees (knees)
I can't get over you (you)
All I need is one more chance (one more chance)
I was just playing wit them girls
I was gonna get right back (get right back)
I was trippin yo love is where it's at
I'm on my knees
Lord please show me some love
And answer this player's prayer
