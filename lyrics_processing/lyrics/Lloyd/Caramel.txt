She like five-five
Grew up on the East Side
She a college girl but she like the hood type
She the only drug, I need to get my mind right
I don't got to ask, she said that it's all mine
Had a boyfriend when I met her
But he a lame so you know I had to get her
Had to let go of my old things for her
But I don't mind
Cause she bad, yeah she hella fine
