Oh shit, oh shit
It's another hit, get up on it
I'm so horny and I want it
So get up on this, get up on the dick

I want you to know how deep my love goes
I ain't gotta a lot of time, no speech, just follow
Some tricks in and up my sleeve at the magic show
Got your body on top of me, all around, in and out you go
These stars come from within before I knew your name
I was curious, do you know if you feel the same?
And to see a smile on your face I'll do almost anything
Serious, girl, I don't play no games

I wanna take you out, freak you out, bust my gun and take the charge
As long as you say my name every time I break you off, girl I'll

Give you what you want
'Cause your love is all I need
I'ma turn you on
With all the things I do
Girl, you're made for me
'Cause your love is all I need
And you gon' make that sound
From all the things we do

Take a break as we escape to my Decatur loft
Girl, you're wet as a dream and I'm ready to break you off
I switched up my routine to something you never saw
I'ma make you scream all night long
When I look into your eyes, I know it's real
Spend my whole life tryna find a way to show you how I feel
You're the only one on my mind and you know the deal
Make you feel alright, girl, you know I will

I wanna take you out, freak you out, bust my gun and take the charge
As long as you say my name every time I break you off, girl I'll

Give you what you want
'Cause your love is all I need
I'ma turn you on
With all the things I do
Girl, you're made for me
'Cause your love is all I need
And you gon' make that sound
From all the things we do

Oh shit, oh shit
It's another hit, get up on it
I'm so horny and I want it
So get up on this, get up on the dick
I wanna take you out, freak you out, bust my gun and take the charge
