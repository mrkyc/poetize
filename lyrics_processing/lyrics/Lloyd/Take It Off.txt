And my conceited friend
Been signing autographs

I'm in the hallway
Don't need no hall pass
If I eat it then everbody gonna order that
Everything I do these bitches wishin' they'd have thought of that
I'ma indian giver
I want the quarter back
If hip hop was dead
Bitch, I just brought her back
Take it to the off
I'mma take it take it off
I'mma take it to the club
Then we take it to the loft
I'mma take it to my niggas
I'mma take it to the boss
I'mma jiggle it jiggle it
Make it so soft
I'mma put it in your face
I'mma put it in your braids
Way I make it pop
He gon' put me in his faves
Make it rain
Its a 10,000 dollar day
Pop it like champaigne on a holiday
