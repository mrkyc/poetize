Don't make plans for dinner
I'm a put you up on the stove and take off all of your clothes
Girl, watch me cook
Until you get nice and tender
You ain't going no where tonight, I'm holding you hostage
So bring it front and center we bout to get up
And I might mess up your make-up
But I don't care how you look
'Cause I know I found winner
I hope your ready to run your victory lap

This is the year of the lover
Let's make a baby, let's do something crazy
Let's reach out and love one another

I'm a catch you in the shower while you dripping wet
I'm a come and kiss your neck, you gone kiss mine back
How sexy is that?
Rub your teardrop, put your body on the counter
You gone say "Do that daddy"
I'm gone say, "Okay momma"
Wrap you in a towel and bring you over to the bed
I'll watch you spread and get in between your legs
Now, I know that you won't give my loving to no other
We on top of the covers
