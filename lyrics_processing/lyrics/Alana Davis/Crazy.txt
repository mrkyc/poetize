You've got your home of the brave
And I've got my land of the free
You conform to what society says
And I conform to me
Looking for light in the corners
Getting caught in the spider web
You look at me as if I'm giving a performance
When I'm just feeding my head
And you know that I'm doing alright
And I won't explain myself to you just to avoid a fight
How I'm living ain't correct
But for me, it's just right

I'm not completely insane
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame
Got no shame 'bout my game
Don't want nobody to save me

I've got a pair of ruby slippers that
That I don't wear much anymore
And if I had the nerve
I'd click my heels and return
To the wonderland I knew before
I'm waiting on a slow boat to China
Wanna sail away to the sun
I've been searching for myself
And I know I'm gonna find her
If I break away from everyone
So, the way that I act may not fit in
Just because I got a mind of my own
Doesn't mean its a sin
I don't ask you to give up;
Don't expect me to give in
You might also like
I'm not completely insane
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame
Got no shame 'bout my game
Don't want nobody to save me
Oh I'll say it again
I'm just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame
Got no shame 'bout my game
Don't want nobody to save me

Some like to live for the moment
Taking life into their hands everyday
And if they don't get killed
They get so high off the thrill
They could float to heaven anyway
And others want to save for tomorrow
Thinking money is security
Well, I understand the need
But I don't get the greed
They all seem pretty crazy to me
You can tell by the expression I wear
Though I seem a little strange to you
I don't really care, I've got the freedom to be
There are others like me everywhere
I'm not completely insane
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame
Got no shame 'bout my game
Don't want nobody to save me
Oh I'll say it again
I'm just a little bit crazy
There's no one to blame
Got no shame 'bout my game
Don't want nobody to save me
Nobody to save me
Nobody to save me
I'm a little bit crazy
Nobody to save me
