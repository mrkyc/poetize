Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am a poster girl with no poster
I am 32 flavors and then some

Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am a poster girl with no poster
I am 32 flavors and then some
And I'm beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
'Cause someday you're going to get hungry
And eat all of the words that you just said

I am what I am
I am 32 flavors and then some

God help you if you are an ugly girl
Course too pretty is also your doom
'Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred
For the prettiest girl in the room
God help you if you are a phoenix
And you dare to rise up from the ash
A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy while
You are just flying past
You might also like
I am what I am
I am 32 flavors and then some
I'm taking my chances as they come
I am 32 flavors and then some
I am nobody but I am someone
Someone

I'd never try to give my life meaning
By demeaning you
And I would like to state for the record
I did everything that I could do
I am beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
'Cause someday you're going to be starving
And eating all of the words that you just said
That you said

I am what I am
I am what I am
I am 32 flavors and then some
I'm taking my chances as they come
I am 32 flavors and then some
I'm looking for truth but there is none
I am 32 flavors and then some
I'll never forget where I came from
I am 32 flavors and then some
I'm nobody but I am someone
I am 32 flavors and then some
I'm taking my chances as they come
I am 32 flavors and then some
