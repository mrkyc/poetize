It's a strange, the strangest emotion
I'm all wrapped up with my head in the clouds
The sweet child thinks he doesn't deserve me yeah
But I'm not that proud
I'd walk for miles to see that handsome face
To be with you baby I'd go anyplace
So you say that you ain't got money

Cause I'm so in love with you honey
What I got I'll share

Help me understand
Because love is stronger than
It'll serve you longer than pride
Now father lend me your strength
I know you think I'm weak but I'm not ashamed
Cause I'm in love and I'll tell you it's real
I may be young but I know how I feel
So you think he's gonna up and leave me I disagree
He said he'd give up the world just to please me
And care for me he'll
