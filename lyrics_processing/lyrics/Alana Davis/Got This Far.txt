I on't think it ever crossed my mind
That you would be more to me than just a lover
Cause i was doing fine on my own
Wasn't really lonely, just alone
But a least i knew where i was and what
I wanted but now
I dont know how you got me babe
So open wide
And i don't know how to tell you babe
The way it feels inside
I know i have afeeling you
You could hold me longer
We get stronger everyday
And i don't know what you've done to me
I'm so turned around i can barely see
The way that i'm supposed to be
I'm so wrapped up in what i think you think of me
*chorus*
I don't know how we got this far
How am i supposed to live a life
Burdened by the thought of you my love
How will i ever be alright
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
You might also likeEverytime i look into your eyes
I can feel the pressure start to rise
Pulling me into you and what you show me
Well i believe love can conquer all
But is it really love that makes you fall
Or just the fantasy of understanding
I don't how you're gonna save
The rest of my heart
I don't know how i'd stop you baby
Or how to even start
I know i have a feeling that you
Are something to discover
The lover that you are
And i don't know how you got through
I'm not the kind of girl you're suppossed to get to
I've been hurt before
I don't want it anymore
I'm safer in my solitude
*chorus*
I don't know how we got this far
How am i supposed to live a life
Burdened by the thought of you my love
How will i ever be alright
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
I don't know how you got through
But just like a child i run to you
And i don't know what else to say
Nobody soothes me the way that you do
*chorus*
I don't know how we got this far
How am i supposed to live a life
Burdened by the thought of you my love
How will i ever be alright
La la la la la la la la la la la
