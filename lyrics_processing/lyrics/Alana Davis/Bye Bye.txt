I called my mom I called my friend
Looking for a reason to go home again
But you make me feel like I don't belong
Like my heart's too weak and my head's too strong
Opposites attract sometimes
But not the way you're attracting mine
And I can't change the way you are
Even though you think you're some kind of rock star

I want you out of my life, my life, my life
'Cause your heart is cold as ice
It's time that you hit the door (Hit the door)
I don't wanna see you no more (I don't want you no more)
I want you out of my life, my life, my life
'Cause your heart is cold as ice
It's time that you hit the door (Hit the door)
I don't wanna see you no more (Bye bye)

You want me to walk like this and talk like that
Dye my hair and don't wear hats
And dress too sleazy and go too far
But all I wanna do is play my guitar
And I don't think that it's fair
And I don't think that you care about me
Yeah but I see the way it's got to be (It's got to be)
I want you out of my life
You might also like
I want you out of my life, my life, my life
'Cause your heart is cold as ice
It's time that you hit the door (Hit the door)
I don't wanna see you no more
(I want you out of) my life, my life, my life
'Cause your heart is cold as ice
It's time that you hit the door (Hit the door)
I don't wanna see you no more (Bye bye)

You gon' miss it when I do it like this
When I do it like that
When I do it like this
When I do it like that
You gon' miss it when I do it like this
When I do it like that
When I do it like this
Can you tell me why
Why am I in this alone?
Is my love too much for you?
What's wrong with home?
I hope you have found your answer
Because I think that I found mine
I want you out of my life
I want you out of my life, my life, my life
'Cause your heart is cold as ice
It's time that you hit the door (Hit the door)
I don't wanna see you no more
(I want you out of) my life, my life, my life
'Cause your heart is cold as ice
It's time that you hit the door (Hit the door)
