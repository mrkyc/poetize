You had it, you lost it
You took it, you ruined it
Let's face it: you blew it!
Face the facts, bub:
You fucked up!
Get a close look:
You fucked up good!
You fucked up good!

You fucked up! You fucked up!

You fucked up! Ha-ha-ha-ha...
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
You've been stripped down
Like a helpless child again
Lost in the darkness
No one to protect you
Or guide you as you pass
Strangled by sparks
Face the facts: you've fallen off the track
Broke your own sack... you fucked up!
You fucked up! You fucked up! You fucked up!
You fucked up! You fucked up!
