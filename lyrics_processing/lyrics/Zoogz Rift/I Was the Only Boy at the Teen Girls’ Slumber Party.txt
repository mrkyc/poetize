I dreamed that I was on this Wally George show before it was canceled, and that he was interviewing me
This really blew my mind: the fact that me, a long-haired, overweight, post-hippie Dadaist, would be humiliated by a rude obnoxious loudmouth asshole on syndicated television, and you know it Hmm...
But there I was
I was taken to a place, tied up in a giant burlap bag, and tossed into the California Aqueduct, only to float upstream somehow and end up in some sleazy dive flat just off of Market Street in downtown San Francisco
There were seventeen naked girls there
They pulled me out of the dripping seaweed and bared my soul to the world. I was horrified
I was the only boy at the teen girls' slumber party
I was the only boy at the teen girls' slumber party
I was the only boy at the teen girls' slumber party
I was the only boy at the teen girls' slumber party
Mmm, gather around girls
Mmm, mmm, ahh, ahh, mmm, ahh, mmm...
Gather- mmm, gather- mmm... yeah, that feels- hey!
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
What- what... Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Eddie and Wally had just delivered some ice cream, which the girls forcibly shoved up my sensitive body openings as part of some damn hazing ritual or some damn thing, I don't...
They chased me around the apartment with feather dusters, goosing my crack, shoving their tits in my mouth when all I wanted was a small dish of the ice cream

When I told them I was married - "What an idiot!" - they kicked my fat, naked ass out on the street butt-fast
I asked some old lady for directions back to L.A., but she called a cop, and I spent the rest of the night playing gin with some law office embezzler in the county jail. He beat me for thirteen bucks
Mmm, what the hell?
I'll never forget the night
That I was the only boy at the teen girls' slumber party
I was the only boy at the teen girls' slumber party
I was the only boy at the teen girls' slumber party
I was the only boy at the teen girls' slumber party
