She got the evil eye, she got the evil eye
You best watch out for the girl over there
She got the evil eye, she got the evil eye
Coyotes howl while the wind blows foul
Out of an evil eye, out of her evil eye
Coyotes howl while the wind blows foul out of her evil eye
Out of her evil eye, out of her evil eye, out of her evil eye
The look at her face I know 'cause she's got a taste
For possession that begins to show, she shows it in the nighttime
The look at her face I know 'cause she's got a taste for possession that begins to show
In the nighttime, she shows in the nighttime
Oh, she shows it in the nighttime, oh, she's got the evil eye
She's got the evil eye, she's got the evil eye
She's got the evil eye
She's got the evil eye
Evil
Eye
Evil eye, evil eye, evil eye
Evil eye, she's got the evil eye
She got the evil
She's lookin' at you, she's got the evil eye
She's lookin' at you, she's lookin' at you, at you, at you
Buy her a pair of sunglasses, she's got the evil eye

You awaken at night to hear her whisper her your name

Out of her evil eye, her evil eye, evil, evil
