We can only go 'round and 'round and 'round
If we try to go through the circle
We'll always end up going down and down
There's no corner to the circle
It's all perpetual motion, isn't it?
Don't ever try to put down the circle
It knows whenever you are using it
Slice it with a knife and it will bleed - oh, yes, it really will
And emit vibrations of triangular pain
But hit it with a blunt instrument like a hammer
And you'll soon discover it don't do a thing, it don't do nothing
It don't do a thing, so forget about it
We can never go through the circle
We can only go 'round and 'round and 'round
If we try to go through the circle
We'll always end up going down and down
There's no corner to the circle
It's all perpetual motion, isn't it?
Don't ever try to put down the circle
It knows whenever you're using it
Slice it with a knife and it will bleed - oh, yes, it really will
And emit vibrations of triangular pain
But hit it with a blunt instrument like a hammer
And you'll soon discover it don't do a thing, it don't do nothing
It don't do a thing, so forget about it
