I always told myself I'd get to Nashville
Where all the country gold is made
Well I prayed to find a way, guess it wasn't in God's will
My roots grew deep in the dirt of LA
I haven't seen my name in the neon lights
Of the honky tonks, but that's alright

'Cause this is the wild, wild west
Where the weather is better and the Eagles did it best
Carole was the King of the radio
Here they call it rodeo, not rodeo
Where there ain't no rules and anything goes
We can all get together down in Calico

Well, I never planned to be on television
But I got a golden ticket out to Hollywood
Every week good people made the time to listen
Felt like they believed in me more than I ever could
Oh, I haven't sung my songs on that Bluebird mic
But I will someday and that's alright

This is the wild, wild west
Where the weather is better and the Eagles did it best
Joni owned the Canyon and the radio
Here they call it rodeo, not rodeo
Where there ain't no rules and anything goes
We can all get together down in Calico
You might also like
Calico, Calico, Calico, Calico
You never really know how things are gonna go
It'll be alright cause the sun's still shinin'

This is the wild, wild west
Where the weather is better and the Eagles did it best
Joni owned the Canyon and the radio
Here they call it rodeo, not rodeo
Where there ain't no rules and anything goes
We can all get together down in Calico

This is the wild, wild west
With the good vibrations and Stevie did it best
A little bit of country and a lot of rock n' roll
The livin' is easy and the coast is gold
Where there ain't no rules and anything goes
