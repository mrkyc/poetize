All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by, just like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where does it go
Yeah, I know, it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know just how to win
Half my life is in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All these things come back to you
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, if just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, if just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away
