Once upon a time we were
Little boys and little girls
With monsters undearneath our beds
Imagination filled our head
Rather stay outside and play
Than stare down at the phone all day

Remember when we had it all? (we had it all)
We were just three feet small (three feet small)
Somewhere the train went off the track
Now I'd give anything to get it back
If we could find that street again (street again)
Where we'd run with all our friends (all our friends)
It's waiting there, it's calling out my name
Cherry Lane
Cherry Lane

You went to school, you got too cool
Used to love to dance, but they called you fool
You got a job making minimum wage
Figured it was time to act your age
Now we've got kids of our own
They can show us the way we've always known

Remember when we had it all? (we had it all)
When we were just three feet small (three feet small)
Somewhere the train went off the track
Now I'd give anything to get it back
If we could find that street again (street again)
Where we would run with all our friends (all our friends)
Waiting there, it's calling out my name
Cherry Lane

Climbing trees and lemonade
Hide and seek, those games we'd play
They were never meant to fade away

Remember when we had it all? (we had it all)
You were just three feet small (three feet small)
Somewhere the train went off the track
Now I'd give anything to get it back
If we could find that street again (street again)
We would play with all our friends (all our friends)
It's waiting there, it's calling out your name
Cherry Lane

We can go back
We can go back to where we were
To where we were
