Now we're Anthrax and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits

And I'll steal your Pop Tarts like I stole your socks!
Yo, man, what's the matter with you? (Not!)
I'll get it the next time, I mean it...

Charlie, beat the beats the beats you beat
The only thing hard is the smell of my feet (P-U!)
So listen up 'cause you might get dissed
Go drain your lizard or take a (Chair!)
(Damn, come on, y'all live the street)
Man, watch the beat!

I'm on your case, I'm in your face
I'll kick you and your father back in place
Step off, sucker, understand
Don't you know that I'm the man?
I'm the man, I'm so bad I should be in detention
Shu-shu-shut up

For a heavy metal band rap's a different way
We like to be different and not cliche
They say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our...
Sexual organ located in the lower abdominal area!
No man, it's "dick!" --Oh-oh!
MASTER!
Danny farted the farts, the farts he farted

And wipe my butt with your (Face!)
"Toilet paper!" Yo, watch the beat!

So, as this rap is winding down
It's plain to see we wear the crown
You know Anthrax is number one
But we don't care, we just wanna have (A festival!)
"Fun", you stupid idiot! (I need more sound)

Joey mailed the mail the mail he mails
We are the kings and all shall hail

And we'll remain the hardest ever

Oh-oh!
(Oh, and there it is again)
