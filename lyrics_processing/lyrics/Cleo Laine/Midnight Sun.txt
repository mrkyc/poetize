Warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace
Rising to a snowy height
Each star its own Aurora Borealis
Suddenly you held me tight;
I could see the midnight sun
I can't explain the silver rain that found me
Or was that a moonlit bay?
The music of the universe around me
Or was that a Nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me
Suddenly the sky turned pale
I could see the midnight sun
Was there such a night?
It's a thrill I still don't quite believe
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve
The flame of it may dwindle to an ember
And the stars forget to shine
And when they see the meadow in December
Icy white and chrystaline
But oh my darling always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun
We saw the midnight sun
You might also likeYour lips were like a red and ruby chalice
Warmer than a summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace
Rising to a summer light
Each star its own Aurora Borealis
Suddenly you held me tight
And then I could see the midnight sun
I can't explain the silver rain that found me
Or was that a moonlit bay?
The music of the universe around me
Or was that a Nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me
And the sky turned pale
I could see the midnight sun
Was there such a night?
It's a thrill I still don't really quite believe
That lovely midnight sun, but after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve
There was still some stardust on my sleeve
That flame may dwindle
And the stars forget to shine
We'll see the meadow in December
Icy white and crystalline
But darling always I'll remember
When your lips are close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun
Yes we saw the midnight sun
