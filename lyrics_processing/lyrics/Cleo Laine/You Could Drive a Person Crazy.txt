You could drive a person crazy
You could drive a person mad
First you make a person hazy
So a person could be had
Then you leave a person dangling sadly
Outside your door
Which it only makes a person gladly
Want you even more
I could understand a person
If it's not a person's bag
I could understand a person
If he meant it as a gag
But worse than that
A person that
Titillates a person and then leaves her flat
Is crazy
He's a troubled person
He's a truly crazy person
Himself!
When a person's personality is personable
He shouldn't oughta sit like a lump
It's harder than a matador coercing a bull
To try to get you off of your rump
So single and attentive and attractive a man
Is everything a person could wish
But turning off a person is the act of a man
Who likes to pull the hooks out of fish

Knock, knock, it really isn't fair
Knock, knock, I'm working all my charms
Knock, knock, a zombie's in my arms
All that sweet affection
What is wrong?
Where's the loose connection?
How long, oh Lord, how long?
Bobby baby, Bobby bubi, Bobby
You could drive a person buggy
You could blow a person's cool
First you make a person feel all huggy
While you make her feel a fool
When a person says that you've upset her
That's when you're good
You impersonate a person better
Than a zombie should
I could understand a person
If he wasn't good in bed
I could understand a person
If he actually was dead
Exclusive you
Elusive you
Will anybody ever get the juice of you?
You're crazy
You're a lovely person
You're a moving, deeply maladjusted
A never to be trusted
Crazy person
Yourself!
