In the closed down market
Kicking up the paper
With his worn out shoes
In his eyes you see no pride
And held loosely by his side
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
Have you seen the old gal
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes are in rags
She's no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
And in the all night cafe
At a quarter past eleven
Same old man is sitting there
All on his own
Looking at the world
Over the rim of his tea-cup
Each tea last an hour
Then he wanders home alone

And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
And have you seen the old man
Outside the seaman's mission
His memory is fading
With those medal ribbons he wears
And in our winter city
The rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero
And a world that doesn't care
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
