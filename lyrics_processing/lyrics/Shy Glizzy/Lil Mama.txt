Woah, Young Jefe, holmes
Lil ma

She look good with me, she gonna thug with me
She hold it down, take her to go meet the plug with me
Make her put that shit on then go hit the club with me
Think it's the hood in me, made her fall in love with me
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama

Glizzy you're a trap nigga, why the fuck you rap?
How much did you make today? 'Cause bitch, I made a lot
Got some nat nats in the A, and in the Chi, I got some thots
If she ain't lil mama then she can't come to the spot
Jefe, I'm a boss, I'm a motherfuckin' boss
Shout out your favorite rapper, he's a motherfuckin' fraud
Lil mama used to stunt now she like me cause I ball
Round of applause, got her clappin' for your boy
Dapper don, they know I'm the motherfuckin' coldest
I bought this bitch some Louboutin's, I barely even knew her
Got a four of red, I'm bout to pour up in a soda
Play with me your ass dead, you already know it
You might also like
She look good with me, she gonna thug with me
She hold it down, take her to go meet the plug with me
Make her put that shit on then go hit the club with me
Think it's the hood in me, made her fall in love with me
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama

I just rolled a J and scrolled through my DM
Got a fucked up text from a BM
Got a phone call, said my bitch cheatin'
Got a phone call, said the homie snitchin'
Bitch get on my nerves, put her on detention
If you ain't got jumped in, then you ain't official
Dolla $ign and Shy Glizzy, realest in the city
If she ain't got an ass then she got some titties
I just stunt the mall and I spent a lot
I just hit the gate runnin' from the cops
Every time this beat drop, she make that pussy pop
Got her in the kitchen, water whippin' up the rock

She look good with me, she gonna thug with me
She hold it down, take her to go meet the plug with me
Make her put that shit on then go hit the club with me
Think it's the hood in me, made her fall in love with me
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
That's my lil mama, lil mama, lil mama
Ohhh, lil mama, lil mama
