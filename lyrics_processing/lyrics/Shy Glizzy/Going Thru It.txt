(Zaytoven)
I've been going through some shit
Aw

Don't ask me why I be with the niggas that I be with (Aw)
Or why I ain't posting pictures (Goddamn, Goddamn)
That's 'cause I'm still in the trenches (Yeah)
Don't ask me why a nigga didn't blow up, or why I didn't show up (What, what)
Fuck all that bullshit, I'ma pour up (Pour up)
Going through some shit, I've been going through some shit (What, what, what)
Lately I've been going through some shit (Goin' through it)
I'm going through some shit (What, what, what)

I think I need to get away my bitch she need a tan
And I just missed another plate, that mean I lost some M's
I know people have said, I'm sorry if I lost some fans
But y'all plan that shit with Ben, so go and take that up with him
But then I told myself, damn I really need some help
Gotta get that wealth, I can't end up on a shelf
Street hottest youngin', make them bad bitches melt
Style knock 'em out, swag champ, where my belt?
I've been going through it, I've been going stupid
The pack ain't too good, fuck it I'm still gon' move it
Say they don't like my music, but they still gon' groove it
Got a gun and don't use it, nigga fuck is you, stupid?

(Boosie Badazz, nigga)
I'm going through some shit (What, what, what)
(Don't nobody understand me, man)

I've been going through some shit, still pissin' in a cup
Several people on my place, sometimes I want to get the fuck
These expressions on my face from diabetes, hard time
On parole still be with my niggas charged with hard crime (Fuck it)
Feel like they cursin' me niggas promise they gon' murder me
So I keep Black Ricky, his extension is thirty-piece
Baby mamma drama, don't wanna argue I want peace
Shit, my daughters teenagers hope they don't fall for niggas like me
Look, don't even talk to me, I'm in my zone
You gon' talk behind my back when I leave, so leave me alone
Mind your business, make your move, get out my way, keep it pushin'
Real niggas go through it 'cause niggas pussies
Don't ask me why I be with the niggas that I be with (Aw)
Or why I ain't posting pictures (Goddamn, Goddamn)
That's 'cause I'm still in the trenches (Yeah)

Going through some shit, I've been going through some shit (What, what, what)
