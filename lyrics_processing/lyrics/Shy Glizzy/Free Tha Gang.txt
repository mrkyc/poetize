I took niggas out the hood, tried to show 'em something different
Free the gang
I miss y'all niggas, man
Yo-Yo

You threw your life away, threw your life away
You was just here yesterday, you went and threw your life away
They took your life away, took your life away
Man, I hope and pray the streets don't take my life away
You threw your life away, threw your life away
You was just here yesterday, you went and threw your life away
They took your life away, took your life away
Man, I hope and pray the streets don't take my life away

Screaming "Free the Gang!" Y'all don't feel my pain
Fuck your bling-bling, they got all my boys in chains
Every single one of them done bust a nigga brains
Nigga, bang, bang, we the fucking murder team
Who would've thought it all started with some throwback topics We had some BB guns, we ain't never used to wrastle
Y'all niggas is rap dudes, we know that is not you
We not gon' attack you, someone just gon' clap you
I don't fuck with no one else, I'm from 37th street
Out here thuggin' by myself, don't nobody mess with me
We at different pedigree, you can't get the recipe
I am living so fast you can't even get next to me
You might also like
You threw your life away, threw your life away
You was just here yesterday, you went and threw your life away
They took your life away, took your life away
Man I hope and pray the streets don't take my life away
You threw your life away, threw your life away
You was just here yesterday, you went and threw your life away
They took your life away, took your life away
Man I hope and pray the streets don't take my life away

Niggas ask me erry' day, nigga
When I'm gon leave da streets alone?
Told them niggas, never, nigga
I'm tryin to bring C-Murder home
Three of my closest partners gone
Added all their time up, hundred and twenty-two years
Think my niggas been lyin' or somethin'
I used to fear da feds, nigga
No, not no fucking more
Cuz they the ones that's roping niggas
You pussy niggas, who telling tho
Same nigga that is poppin' bottles
Same nigga that is riding foreign
Same nigga that playin' real
Be the same nigga thats tellin' on ya
Salute to the niggas who didn't tell
All the niggas worldwide
Never respected a fuck nigga
The ones who snitched to cut they time
Leave me and my niggas alone
Let the real niggas ball
You want to tell somethin'
Tell the world that you a fuck nigga, dawg
You threw your life away, threw your life away
You was just here yesterday, you went and threw your life away
They took your life away, took your life away
Man I hope and pray the streets don't take my life away
You threw your life away, threw your life away
You was just here yesterday, you went and threw your life away
They took your life away, took your life away
Man I hope and pray the streets don't take my life away

Where in the damn clothes
Y'all couldn't wait one second
They say the streets ain't got no patience
I see that now
Glizzy Gang, bang bang
Forever Tre-7
Man I hope and pray the streets, don't take my life away
