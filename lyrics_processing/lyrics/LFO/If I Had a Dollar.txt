Hair as soft as silky sheets
Tone of her voice is soft and sweet
Those big brown eyes and button nose
Oh how I love your little toes
See all these things I dig in you
But you're his, not mine, what should I do?
You tell me sweet things that I wanna hear
Oh you probably don't care, you probably don't care at all
If I had a dollar for all the times you said you'd leave him
Girl I'd be a millionaire
But I wouldn't wanna actually see it
Sit here and see you come my way
You don't know how it feels to be the, be the one behind the scenes
I think you know what I mean
I wanna be your number one
Oh yes I do
Taking walks while holding hands
Telling all your friends that I'm the man
Kissing on your lips is oh so soothing
Let pick you up and watch a movie
See all these things I want from you
But you're his, not mine, what should I do?
Tell me sweet things that I wanna hear
And you probably don't care, you probably don't care at all

Girl I'd be a millionaire
Just wouldn't wanna actually see it
Sit here and see you come my way
You don't know how it feels to be the, be the one behind the scenes
I think you know what I mean
I wanna be your number one
So basically you tell me I'm the man
Now you know you got me sitting round, do run-run
Just for you to leave this guy
And my due date to come
To the tick-tock you don't stop
Shorty rock with me, navigator fully equipped
See we can take a ride down the coast
Lay back to the stylistics
Tell me why that's un-realistic
All you wanna do is like talk to me
What you really need to do is make it hot for me
All these things I want from you
But you're his, not mine, what should I do?
Tell me sweet things that I wanna hear
You probably don't care, you probbaly don't care at all
If I had a dollar for all the times you said you'd leave him
Girl I'd be a millionaire
But I wouldn't wanna actually see it
Sit here and see you come my way
You don't know how it feels to be the, be the one behind the scenes
I think you know what I mean
