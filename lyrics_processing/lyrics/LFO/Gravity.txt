Keepin my feet on the ground every time your around
I feel gravity
And I don't know what to do
I keep on runnin from you
Put me on the cover of rollin stone
Pat me on the back when I come back home
Tell me things that I like to hear
I hold back, but you still come near
Say you care, and you won't let go
I'm in a world that I just don't know
Give me things that I need to fill me
Tell me that this gravity won't kill me
And you don't have to cry for me
And you don't have to lie for me
This whole blue sky is falling down on me
I feel gravity, holdin me down
Keepin my feet on the ground every time your around
I feel gravity
And I don't know what to do
I keep on runnin from you
Full of dreams can't come up short
Drivin down south is my last resource
Let me shine on mtv
Say your proud and happy for me
Look in my eyes, guess how I feel
Cause now-a-days life's so surreal
Give me things that I need to fill me
Tell me that this gravity won't kill me

And you don't have to lie for me
This whole blue sky is falling down on me
I feel gravity, holdin me down
Keepin my feet on the ground every time your around
I feel gravity
And I don't know what to do
I keep on runnin from you
I feel gravity, holdin me down
Keepin my feet on the ground every time your around
I feel gravity
And I don't know what to do
I keep on runnin from you
I feel gravity, holdin me down
Keepin my feet on the ground every time your around
I feel gravity
And I don't know what to do
I keep on runnin from you
I feel gravity, holdin me down
Keepin my feet on the ground every time your around
I feel gravity
And I don't know what to do
