I'm gonna lose my mind
Na-na-na-na-na
You are the reason why
Left your heart by the front door baby
You don't need to come 'round my way no more
That's what my girlfriend said to me
At 10:23 on a lonely monday morn
Found another and he treats me good
Like you never could
Go away, I think you should
Needed you but you weren't there
So now I don't care
Then she put her finger in the air
Baby how can you doubt my love
When you're the reason I'm smilin'
(cause baby love, you're the reason why)
If you deny my heart
Then you should know that it's for you that it's achin'
Cause everything I'll ever need is you
Na-na-na-na-na
I'm gonna lose my mind
Na-na-na-na-na
You are the reason why
Yesterday I saw my ex girl at the mall
With some kid by the name of tommy smith
She was only stickin'
In the corner of her eye
She saw me staring at her and him
She kissed him
Then she smiled at me
They both started laughing
Then they walked past me
She was looking at him like she looked at me
Right before we'd go home and do our thing
I said "gimme one more chance, I love you"
"gimme another chance, I can't live life without you"
She said get away from me boy
I don't care
Walked away with one finger in the air
Baby how can you doubt my love
When you're the reason I'm smilin'
You might also like(cause baby love, you're the reason why)
If you deny my heart
Then you should know that it's for you that it's achin'
Cause everything I'll ever need is you
Na-na-na-na-na
I'm gonna lose my mind
Na-na-na-na-na
You are the reason why
Baby how can you doubt my love
When you're the reason I'm smilin'
(cause baby love, you're the reason why)
If you deny my heart
Then you should know that it's for you that it's achin'
Cause everything I'll ever need is you
Called her up on the telephone, my casio, at 2am
Moonlight shone through my window
Had a song by hendrix in my head
Never understood this girl
This thing called love and the world we're in
Let it ring two more times
She wasn't there
Threw my finger in the air
Na-na-na-na-na
I'm gonna lose my mind
(I'm gonna lose my mind, all right)
(cause baby love, you're the reason why)
Na-na-na-na-na
You are the reason why
Cause everything I'll ever need is you
Baby how can you doubt my love
When you're the reason I'm smilin'
(the one and only reason)
If you deny my heart
Then you should know that it's for you that it's achin'
Cause everything I'll ever need is you
Na-na-na-na-na
I'm gonna lose my mind
(I'm gonna lose my mind)
Na-na-na-na-na
You are the reason why (why, why, why)
