Every other, every other time
I said let's talk about it
As she walked out on me and slammed the door
But I just laugh about it
'Cause she's always playin' those games, come on
Deep down I know she loves me
But she's got a funny way of showin' me how she cares
Last night she did a doughnut on my lawn
And drove out with one finger in the air, oh yeah
Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind
Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time
Sometimes we sit around
Just the two of us, on the park bench
Sometimes we swim around
Like the dolphins in the ocean of our hearts

When we broke up before the prom
And you told everyone that I was gay
Okay
Sometimes I walk around the town
For hours just to settle down
But I take you back and you kick me down
'Cause that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it
Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind
Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time
Keep it up home girl, don't you quit
You know the way you scream is the ultimate
And when I walk away, just watch the clock
I bet I don't even get around the block
I said let's talk about it
As she walked out on me and slammed the door
One day we'll laugh about it
'Cause we're always playin' those games, every other time
Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind
Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time
Keep it up homegirl, don't you quit
You know the way you scream is the ultimate
And when I walk away, just watch the clock
I bet I don't even get around the block
Oh yeah, every other time
