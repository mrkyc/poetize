Somewhere in life and yet on my way to anywhere
A woman named Betris serves me coffee
And she smiled as if she cares
It reminds me of this painting
That I think I've often seen
The kings behind the counter
Serving coffee to James dean
Life is good
Life is great
Life is unbelievable
Life is hard, life is cruel
Life is so beautiful
Ooh yeah ooh yeah

Oh yeah oh yeah
La life is unbelievable
On my way to garden city
On my way to anywhere
A guy named Patrick gives me directions
And he smiles as if he cares
It reminds me of this movie
That I think I've often seen
Pretty much this situation
Except I'd still be Steve McQween
So what would you do if you wake tomorrow
No more sorrows, your dreams came true
So knock on wood and cross your fingers
And count your blessings
It might be you
So what would you do if you wake tomorrow
All your gray sky's turned blue
How many days do you think your given
So get on livin it's up to you
Life is good
Life is great
Life is unbelievable
Life is hard, life is cruel
Life is so beautiful
Ooh yeah ooh yeah
La life is unbelievable
Oh yeah oh yeah

If he so loves the sun
Rock rock on
Yo I be slippin a rippin the party till the break of dawn
If you love rich nice
Or you hate rich nice
Take my advice and just live up your life ('cause it's your's)
(M.O.P)
Hey if your mess'n with the sacred world
It's a never ending test
I don't know where to begin
And I feel I'm at an end
I don't wanna live life
Doing petty nonsense
It's hard to sleep at night
With a guilty conscience
You know It's really a mess
Now I feel blessed
When 20 Minutes from now
It'll all turn to stress
I'm 27 years, All those Brownsville cheers
I'm stuck with all the blood, the sweat and the tears
Baby It's on
A mother sheds tears at the same time a baby is born
On the other side of town a life is lost
A young thug was knocked off and the heat was tossed
Damn
Life is real, it's so trife
But don't stop now Live your life
I know it's hell for the rough
But don't talk down on your man
Unless your helping him out
It's yours
So what would you do if you wake tomorrow
No more sorrows, your dreams came true
So knock on wood and cross your fingers
Now count your blessings
It might be you
So what would you do if you wake tomorrow
All your gray sky's have turned blue
How many days do you think your given
So get on livin , it's up to you
Life is good
Life is great
Life is unbelievable
Life is hard, life is cruel
Life is so beautiful
