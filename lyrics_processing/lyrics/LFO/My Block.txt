It sounds so nice
(chorus)
Come down to my block
Come around my way
That's where the players play
On my block
Do what you wanna do
Fill up your cup with gin and juice
Come down to my block
We'll give you what you need
We're on the gs3's
I think it's plain to see
It's definitely the place to be
The sun is beaming
Another saturday
It's time to kick it
And throw my cares away
Nobody trippin'
Just tryin' to have some fun
And if you need some
Got drinks for everyone
This is your chance tonight everything's gonna be alright
Let's hit the store
It's time to drink some more
You might also like(chorus)
Come down to my block
Come around my way
That's where the players play
On my block
Do what you wanna do
Fill up your cup with gin and juice
Come down to my block
We'll give you what you need
We're on the gs3's
I think it's plain to see
It's definitely the place to be
Come down to my block
Come take a ride with me
In a big, black truck
And all of you player haters
Won't you get off my nu**
I know a place you can go
And meet everybody, I know
It's got all the things a player likes
Like sunshine and straight times and
You can play everyday
It's summertime baby
So in the bed if you wanna stay
In case you didn't know
(chorus)
Come down to my block
Come around my way
Come on

On my block
Do what you wanna do
Fill up your cup with gin and juice
Come down to my block
Well give you what you need

It's definitely the place to be
Come down to my block
So bring some cogniac
We're gonna have a real good time

All you ladies bring your friends
Got a pool to throw 'em in
Oh yeah, it's goin' down tonight
It's all right on the west side this is your chance tonight
