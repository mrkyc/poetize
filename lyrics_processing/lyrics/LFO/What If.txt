Oh where'd that horse and carriage go?
In the castle I'll build for you
On an island meant just for two
Would it be just stuck around
What if all that's lost was found
What if I could be, the only one that she'd ever dream of
If I were some movie star
With some big expensive car
At some big first night premiere
With ben affleck and richard gere
Would you give me just one look
If I wrote some obscure book
Would you give me just one chance
In some other circumstance
Someone like me, deserves someone like you
Lalalalalalalala
Played a part of joe d'maggio
Oh where'd that horse and carriage go?
In the castle I'll build for you
On an island meant just for two
Would it be just stuck around
What if all that's lost was found
What if I could be, the only one that she'd ever dream of
You might also likeIf I was the great houdini
Granting wishes like a geni
If I were some big tough guy
Who went to mars and made you cry
Told you lie couse they say
Nice guys will lose anyway
In some other circumstance
Would you give me just one chance?
Someone like me, deserves someone like you

Oh where'd that horse and carriage go?
Or the castle I'll build for you
On an island meant just for two
Would it be just stuck around
What if all that's lost was found
What if I could be, the only one that she'd ever dream of
What if I (what if I was the only one)
What if I was the only one
If I were a super hero
A good fella like de'niro
If I could face all my fears
And dated girls like britney spears
Wore black leather on a harley
In jamaica like bob marley
In some other circumstance
Would you give me just one chance?
