Liven in the bodega
I met a girl by the name of Alayna
She said she wants to marry me
But her ex boyfriend's gettin' mad at me
I said
You take the high road
I take the low
And I'll meet you somewhere they don't know
La, la, la, la, la, la
Girl this time I think I went to far
When I'm witchu
Girl I feel like this cold world has been good to me
Make me feel like I could see
Through the birds and the bee's
You put my mind at ease
And I
Don't know really what to do
One look and I find myself in love witchu
Miss Alayna
So wild
No man contain ya
Strung my guitar
Keep it hott like fire
And I
You might also likeDon't know which way to go
And I
Shoulda never let my feelings show
Could it be my life's been taken?
I can feel my young heart breakin'

Girl this time I think I went to far
Passed this saloon
Old man drink the whiskey
Doors wide open
Glass breaks
Lies are misty
And I, I could feel a purple haze
Take a stroll across the bridge
To where Alayna lays
Brown eyes
Penetrate my thoughts at night
Gypsy women look in here
And said she sees fight
She piranha
Crawled to my knee's
Beg Madonna
Please be wit me cuz I feel I'm a goner
And I
Don't know which way to go
And I
Shoulda never let my feelings show
Could it be my life's been taken?
I can feel my young heart breakin'
