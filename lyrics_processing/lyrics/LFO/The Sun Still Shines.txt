I think of you since you've been gone
And every night b4 I wake
Dream of days gone by to mend my heartbreak
The sun still shines
The moon still glows
Can't someone tell me where did my love go
The world still turns
I still believe
She's somewhere out there lookin down on me
Your so happy babe I'm missing u like crazy
U were the one that is realized right by my side forever
Still hear our favorite song tears fall as I sing along
I don't know if I can make it without you my hearts still achin
I meant what I said
When I told u that I love u for all time
And years have gone by
But I'm still as much in love as I was that night
The sun still shines
The moon still goes (still goes)
Can't someone tell me where did my love go (where did my love go)
The world still turns (hmm mmm)
I still believe (I still believe)
She's somewhere out there lookin down on me

I hear the wind call out your name it's makin me remember
That night u drove away
Wish I had just one more day
I don't know if I can make it without u my hearts still breakin
I meant what I said
When I told u that I love u for all time
And years have gone by
But I'm still as much in love as I was that night
The sun still shines (shines)
The moon still goes (still goes)
Can't someone tell me where did my love go (ohh ohh ohhh)
The world still turns (the world still turns)

Dream of days gone by to mend my heartbreak (ohh)
I know the rain still falls
I know the sun still shines
I know that there will still be better days if u were still mine
These years keep passin by
But I'm still as much in love as I was that night
The sun still shines (sun still shines)
The moon still glows (moon still glows)
Can't someone tell me where did my love go (my love)
The world still turns (the world still turns)
