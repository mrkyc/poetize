About (I think about you)
You (all the time girl)
All of the time (hey girl wutcha tryin to do i mean like whatchu tryin to put my body through)
Television is takin its toll on me
I can't tune anyone else
It's only you I see
It's drivin me crazy
Only got a one track mind
Thinkin bout the way your body moves when you walk by
And it's makin me want you
(and the hook goes)
Think (I think about you)
About (I think about you) (every second every hour of the day)
You
All the time girl
All of the time
Hey girl whatcha tryin to do
I mean like whatcha trin to put my body through
Got me trippin
Showin off your rose tattoo
Right above your ankle
Whatcha tryin to make me do
Go insane?
I can't breathe
I can't sleep
All I do is fantasize bout the look that's in your eyes
Really I do
You might also like(and the hook goes)
Got me thinkin
Think (Constantly I got you on my mind)
About (I keep thinking of you all the time)
You all of the time
Girl I just think of you I don't know what else to do
Hey girl, whatcha tryin to do?
I mean like, whatcha tryin to put my body through?
I wonder if there is a chance for me baby
One possibility that I can make love to you
Instead of dreamin and hopin so hard and long
Make it come true
Make it come true

I said
Ferre Jacques, dorme vouz, whatcha wanna do?
The world is spinnin
But I only seem to think of you
She said she never had a real boyfriend
And Mr. Teenage Love don't you hurt me again
Check the prognosis
You got the style to content me
Without you in my life
I guess the whole thing would be empty
Jiffy pop love, you don't stop, you got me sinkin
Visualize your body as I'm thinkin, I'm thinkin
Think (Constantly I got you on my mind)
About (I keep thinking of you all the time)
You all of the time
(Girl I just think of you I don't know what else to do)
