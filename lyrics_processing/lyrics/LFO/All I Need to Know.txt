He played you, betrayed you
Like a fool with his games and lies
Open your heart girl I can make you see
Now close your eyes and come and flow with me
You need a man who'll always be around
One who'll love you down
(chorus)
You say you don't want me to break your heart
I'll be good to you, I promise to, girl
And if you want me to be in your life
Then just tell me so
Cause that's all I need to know
I'll hold you (hold you), console you (console you)
I'm just what you're lookin' for
He had you trippin', baby listen, you're lonely days are no more
Life without you girl, I can't conceive

Just tell me baby that you won't let go
That's all I need to know
(chorus)
You say you don't want me to break your heart
I'll be good to you, I promise to, girl
