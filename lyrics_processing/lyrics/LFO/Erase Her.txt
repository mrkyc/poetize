City lights electrify, I walk alone
One starry night
Afraid to sleep, cause I see her
Its all the same, it's all a blur
Can you erase her, erase her
Can you help me lose my mind
Can you erase her, erase her
Can you leave the past behind
Its all so cold (it's all so cold)
A dirty game
I saw her out (I saw her out)
She looked the same
She cracked a smile (she cracked a smile)
I used to see
I wonder where (I wonder where)
I'm supposed to be
Can you erase her, erase her
Can you help me lose my mind
Can you erase her, erase her
Can you leave the past behind
Can you make me laugh
Can you make me cry
Can you say that these walls are built inside
'cause I know
She's not loved
