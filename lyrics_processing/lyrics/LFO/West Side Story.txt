Veronica's the song that's in my head
Veronica's the name I've often said
Well her friends say she's too good for me
It's kinda like west side story
She's the only one for me
She's the only girl I see
I can't seem to find a damn thing wrong with ya
Veronica
Every day I see your friends talkin' about me
But I know there's something there that no one can see
It reminds me of romeo and juliet
Like we're living on a movie set
Montague and capulet
Make your daddy sweat
Cause he wishes we had never met
She says that I just make her world round
God knows I feel it too
I'm so in love, I'm so in love, I'm so in love with you...
=========chorus=========:
Your brothers say, it's over now they're looking for me
But I know there's something there that no one can see
It reminds me of romeo and juliet
Like were living on a movie set
I'm a shark and youre a jet
Make your mommy sweat
Cause she wishes we had never met
She says I just make her world go round
I know 'cause I feel it too, I'm so in love with you
Veronica

Rap:
Check-check-check-check-uhhh
Johnny rocket, got her number in my pocket
We was on the run, daddy got a gun, stop it!
Playin' with veronica, she's got me now
But her brother got a biscuit and it might go pow
I'm shaking-to break in-and makin-and bakin-to do-
Wit'cha and yo crew-and ain't doin-nothing
But-grabbin a mic-and I'm smackin a mic
And I'm still on beat
You can't stop the blood rush and you can't stop love
So it's time to knuckle up and pray to the lord above
She says that I just make the world go round
God knows I feel it too, I'm so in love with you
