I told you I was sorry
Won't you tell me what to do
To make your sad eyes believe
Cause, girl, no matter what it takes
I swear I will make it better
Cause I'm not so used to wearing
My heart out on my sleeve
(chorus)
Cross my heart
I swear
I'm gonna make this right
Please don't leave me standing here
I'll make all your darkness disappear
Cross my heart
This time, girl, I'll be loving you forever
And when I need to say a prayer
I call your name
On my heart, I swear
Do you remember yesterday
You promised me tomorrow
How we held each other
The way you kissed me
Don't throw it all away
Cause, girl, we've got so much to lose
Can we just tear out these pages
Give me one more chance, I'm begging you
But, baby, please don't go
You might also like(chorus)
Cross my heart
I swear
I'm gonna make this right
Please don't leave me standing here
I'll make all your darkness disappear, baby
Cross my heart
This time, I'll be loving you forever
And when I need to say a prayer
I call your name
On my heart, I swear
Cross my heart, oh
I'm tryin' to turn this love around
And keep the sky from falling down
I'm on my knees
(chorus)
Cross my heart
I swear
I'm gonna make this right
Please don't leave me standing here
I'll make all your darkness disappear
Cross my heart
This time, girl, I'll be loving you forever
When I need to say a prayer
I call your name
On my heart, I swear
Cross my heart
I swear
I need your touch
I need it so much
Cross my heart
I need to feel you next to me
Cross my heart
I swear
I'm gonna make this right
Please don't leave me standing here
I'll make all your darkness disappear
Cross my heart
