I been up, I been down
I been side to side, I been buried alive
I been hurt, I been robbed
But I'm ok
I been hot, I get cold
I been in a cell
And outside as well
I'm a slob w/ no job but I'm alright
'cause I don't wanna shout
And I don't wanna scream
And I don't wanna talk all night about these stupid things
Because its like that
And that's the way it is
I know everything I need to know now
Yeah that's the way it is
I know everything I wanna do now
And that's the way it is
I know pictures get faded
Yeah that's the way it is
'cause its like that
You might also likeI get high, I been low
I can't turn around
I been upside-down
I choke 'cause I'm broke all the time
Your not real but fad
I got a real good mom
I got a real good dad
I'm a creep
But I sleep just fine
And I don't wanna shout
And I don't wanna scream
And I don't wanna talk all night about these stupid things
Because its like that
And that's the way it is
I know everything I need to know now
Yeah that's the way it is
I know everything I wanna do now
And that's the way it is
I know pictures get faded
Yeah that's the way it is
I know everything I need to know now
'cause that's the way it is
I know everything I wanna do now
And that's the way it is
I been up, I been down
