6 minutes, lfo ur on
I was at a party with my mind in the gutter
She walked in behind me with a friend and her brother
Stepped onto the dance floor shakin her hips
I thought I might bust when she licked her lips
Sometimes I wish that I was someone like brad pitt
She walked right over to me then said hey we should split
Sometimes I wish that I had a girl that looked that fine
Not thinkin about forever
Just 6 minutes of her time
One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's got my on my knees
Five minutes and she's got me beggin please
Another minute and she's shows me something new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes
I was at work with my mind in the gutter
She was in a magazine, her face on the cover
Layin in a room that was lit by a candle
That's the type of girl that I wish that I could handle
You might also likeSometimes I wish that I looked like tom cruise
Cause in a crowded room
But I'd be the one that she would choose
Sometimes I wish a girl like that could just be mine
Not thinkin about forever just six minutes of her time
One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's got my on my knees
Five minutes and she's got me beggin please
Another minute and she's shows me something new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes
Sometimes I feel like the "catcher in the rye"
Sometime I wish that I could catch your eye
Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy (be that guy)
Yeah yeah
Whoa time is passin by
Whoa I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my heart begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
Its just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's got my on my knees
Five minutes and she's got me beggin please
Another minute and she's shows me something new
I need six minutes with you
