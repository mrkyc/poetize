I know it seems to long but listen
I gotta do what I gotta do
And the wheels on the bus go round
And it makes me wonder, what kinda spell we're under
What would jack and diane do?
Hey sharona I don't understand
Why we gotta argue all the time
You got your life and I got mine
I think it's time I press rewind
Stop when the red lights flashes
Oopsey daisy, my whole world crashes
Whats a wanna be rock star to do?
All I wanna do is be with you
Every single time I turn away
You say "that's it! I'm never coming back till you say your sorry"
28 days til I see you
I know it seems to long, but listen
I gotta do what I gotta do
And the wheels on the bus go round
And it makes me wonder, what kinda spell we're under
What would jack and fiane do?
Gimme the microphone and I'm a get buck wild
Gimme the microphone I kick my kungfu style
You might also likeHey sharona c'mon hold my hand
Talk to me and help me understand
Tell me how my eye got black and blue
Can I spend another night with you
Sippin on purple passion
Laugh at me 'cause I ain't in fashion
Sometimes u do what u gotta do
All I wanna do is be with you
Every single time I turn away
You say "that's it! I'm never coming back till you say your sorry"
28 days til I see you
I know it seems to long, but listen
I gotta do what I gotta do
And the wheels on the bus go round
And it makes me wonder, what kinda spell we're under
What would jack and diane do?
Engine engine number 9
On the metro transit line
If our love goes off the track
Pick it up pick it up pick it up
Yeah
Please tell her to leave my things out front
By the porch
And of course there's no need for remorse
Would u please keep the fish
I'll come back after this
But I can't. that's a lie
I just won't say good bye
I'm sorry
28 days til I see you
I know it seems to long but listen
I gotta do what I gotta do
And the wheels on the bus go round
And it makes me wonder, what kinda spell we're under
