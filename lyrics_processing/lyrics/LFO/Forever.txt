Was nothing more than a waste of my time
I've always thought I'd be above these feelings
Always seem to mess with my mind
I said you'd never catch me in the corner of my room
Gazing at a picture of you
And now that all don't mean nothin' 'cause everytime i
Think about thinkin' girl
I'm thinkin' of you
(chorus)
And forever, for the rest of my life
Through it all girl
I'll be right by your side
I'll give my heart baby
I'll give you my mind
I'll be the one that brings the joy to your life
And if you're willing girl
Just give me the chance
And I promise I will be a good man
And forever, for the rest of my life
I'll be right by your side
And now the love you give to me
Is sweeter than the sprinkles
On the top on mama's apple pie
I know you know I'm in love
When you're staring at the sparkle
That appears in the corner of my eye
You don't have to worry 'bout it
No, the things that I said before
Because I'm so in love
And there ain't nothin' gonna stop it now
I'd bet it on the moon and the stars in the sky above
You might also like(chorus)
And forever, for the rest of my life
Through it all girl
I'll be right by your side
I'll give my heart baby
I'll give you my mind
I'll be the one that brings the joy to your life
And if you're willing girl
Just give me the chance
And I promise I will be a good man
And forever, for the rest of my life
I'll be right by your side
I never thought that it could happen to me
That I could fall in love
I can't beieve it baby
But I can see that you're
You are the only one I'm thinkin' of
It doesn't matter baby
I don't really care no more
As long as we're together
Baby I'll be right there
I won't go nowhere
I want your love forever
(chorus)
And forever, for the rest of my life
Through it all girl
I'll be right by your side
I'll give my heart baby
I'll give you my mind
I'll be the one that brings the joy to your life
And if you're willing girl
Just give me the chance
And I promise I will be a good man
And forever, for the rest of my life
I'll be right by your side
(chorus)
And forever, for the rest of my life
Though it all girl
I'll be right by your side
I'll give my heart baby
I'll give you my mind
I'll be the one that brings the joy to your life
And if you're willing girl
Just give me the chance
And I promise I will be a good man
And forever, for the rest of my life
I'll be right by your side
