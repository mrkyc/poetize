Singin la shalalalalalala shalalalalalala
I just want be where you are
There's a cloud that follows me at night
When I'm all-alone, your outta sight
And I ask myself, am I really the one?
Miss love I hope you realize
There's something magic in your eyes
And I hope our journeys only just begun
Drivin down the sunset
Put the top down, rock the 8 track
I smile as if to say I think you know (I think you know)
Hope-in for tomorrow but there's always hidden sorrow
Or the night before, it's time for me to go
Singin la shalalalalalala shalalalalalala
Singin la shalalalalalala shalalalalalala
I just want be where you are
At a stop light on the way ya
I was laughin as ya sang a song by abba that I think I used to know
I saw that something in your eyes, and I must confess I realize
On the way to la exco wanna go
Drivin down sunset
Put the top down, rock the 8 track
I smile as if to say I think you know (I think you know)
Hope in for tomorrow but there's always hidden sorrow
Or the night before, it's time for me to go

I just want be where you are
I just want be where you are
I just want be where you are
Hey young girl, the world is yours
Gotta open up these doors
Lets do it again
Only wanna be with you again
Wrote this song while I was gone
And I hope it won't be long
Let's, let's do it again
Me and you
Again
