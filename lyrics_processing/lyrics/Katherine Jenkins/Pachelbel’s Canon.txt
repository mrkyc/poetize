My eyes when I watch the sun setting over the sea
My lungs when the cool breeze blows softly into me
You are my ears when I listen to Canon in D
My happiness you were, you are and always you will be...
When you laugh, when you sing, when you cry and when you dream
When you are near or when you are far, you always will be, always were and always are, mi cario, my soul mate, my number one weakness and my greatest strength
When you were born, while you live and long after you die, you were, you are and always will you be mine
My sweetest sweet, my dearest dear, my only trust and hope after God and my freedom of all fears. Always my Love, no matter how far or how near
The oceans so vast as far as one can see under the sky so blue and beyond all the mountains' highest peaks. So far, deep and long my love for you, so strong and lasting, so real and true
The beauty of your eyes looking into mine, your skin, your hair all so soft and so fine... How lucky am I that you could be all mine
This time I now know as the cool autumn winds softly blow
I've said this all even before, just yesterday and long ago!
So I stand now silent to all, for only she really knows...
And the autumn breeze slowly sooths a once lost soul
Alas my Angel I have found and she has found me
So far, far away but still hear her heart beat
Beyond all any hopes and more than any dream
I now believe in fate and see in destiny
The Lord has not left us, alone or lonely...
For now my Angel I have found and she has found me
I can not put into all the words
Or have imagined or foreseen, how perfect we will feel together
And how I miss you every time you log off and leave
