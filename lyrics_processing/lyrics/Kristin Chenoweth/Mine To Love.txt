You happened like a sudden storm that caught me my surprise
In an accidental devastating moment of my life
You upset me with your kindness
You upset me with your smile
You cracked my heart wide open and I felt alive for a little while

You were mine, mine to hold, in the rain, out in the cold
With a stolen cup of coffee at a place that no one knows
You were mine, just enough that each breath I take keeps getting tough
And every kiss is running out of time
You were mine, but you were never mine to love
Mine to love, ohh

We kept each other's secrets, and we never made demands
It was so exciting never making any kind of plans
We tore up all the rule books and we cast them to the wind
Now I'm left just chasing pages, tryna find myself again

You were mine, mine to hold, sharing tales we never told
On a long lost day last summer with the sand beneath our toes
You were mine, just enough that each breath I take keeps getting tough
And every kiss is running out of time
You were mine, but you were never mine to love
Mine to love, ohh

You were mine just for a minute, like a roller-coaster ride
I was scared when I got in it, then I laughed until I cried
Now I'm back at the beginning and I'm walking out the door
'Cause you know I just can't do this anymore
Oh, you know I just can't do it anymore

You were mine, mine to hold, now the leaves are turning gold
And the year we spent together burns forever in my soul
You were mine, just enough that each breath I take keeps getting tough
And every kiss is running out of time
Wish me luck, I'll be fine
You were mine
