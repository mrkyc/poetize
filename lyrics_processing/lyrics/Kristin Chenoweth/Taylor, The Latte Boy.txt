There's a boy who works at Starbucks
Who is very inspirational
He is very inspirational because of many things
I come in at 8:11, and he smiles and says, "How are you?"
When he smiles and says, "How are you?"
I could swear my heart grows wings
So today at 8:11
I decided I should meet him
I decided I should meet him
In a proper formal way
So today at 8:11 when he smiled and said, "How are you?"
I said "Fine, and my name's Kristin,"
And he softly answered, "Hey"
And I told him "My name's Kristin, and thank you for the extra foam"
And he said his name was Taylor
Which provides the inspiration for this poem:

Taylor the latte boy
Bring me java, bring me joy
Taylor the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

So I'd like to get my nerve up
To recite my poem musical
He would like the fact it's musical
Because he plays guitar
And today at 8:11, Taylor told me he was playing
In a band down in the village in the basement of a bar
And he smoothly flipped the lever to prepare my double latte
But for me he made it triple (And he didn't think I knew)
But I saw him flip the lever, and for me he made it triple
And I knew the triple latte meant that Taylor loved me too
I said, "What time are you playing? And thank you for the extra skim"
He said, "Keep the $3.55," because this triple latte was on him"

Taylor the latte boy
Bring me java, bring me joy
Taylor the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

I used to be the kind of girl
Who'd run when love rushed toward her
But finally a voice whispered, "Love can be yours
If you step up to the counter and order"

Taylor the latte boy
Bring me java, bring me joy
Taylor the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

So many years my heart has waited
Who'd have thought that love could be so caffeinated?
Taylor, the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him
