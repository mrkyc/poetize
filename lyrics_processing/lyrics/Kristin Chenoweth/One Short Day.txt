Come with me to the Emerald City

One short day in the Emerald City

Oh, I've always wanted to see the Emerald City!

One short day in the Emerald City
One short day in the Emerald City
One short day full of so much to do
Ev'ry way that you look in the city
There's something exquisite you'll want to visit
Before the day's through

There are buildings as tall as Quoxwood trees

Dress salons

And libraries
Palaces!

Museums!

A hundred strong
There are wonders like I've never seen

It's all grand

And it's all green!

I think we've found the place where we belong!
I wanna be in this hoi polloi

So I'll be back for good someday

To make my life and make my way

But for today, we'll wander and enjoy...

One short day in the Emerald City
One short day to have a lifetime of fun
One short day

And we're warning the city
Now that we're in here
You'll know we've been here

Before we are done!

Elphie, come on, we'll be late for Wizomania!
Who's the mage
Whose major itinerary is making all Oz merrier?
Who's the sage
Who's sagely sailed in to save our posteriors?
Whose enthuse for hot air ballooning
Has all of Oz honeymooning?
Woo-oo-oo
Wizn't he wonderful?
Our wonderful Wizard!
One short day in the Emerald City
Who's the mage
Whose major itinerary is making all Oz merrier?
One short day to have a lifetime of fun
Who's the sage
Who's sagely sailed in to save our posteriors?

What a way to be seeing the city

Where so many roam to
We'll call it home, too
And then, just like now, we can say
We're just two friends

Two good friends

Two best friends

Sharing one wonderful
One short

The Wizard will see you now!
