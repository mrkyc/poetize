I want someone I can talk to
All night, anytime I want to
Who'll be there when I want and won't be there when I don't want him to be
Who understands it's not easy to understand me
Someone who loves me, sometimes bugs me, sometimes makes me wanna scream
I need my space, someone not in my face
I want somebody

I want somebody I can bitch about
I want somebody I can't live without
I want somebody who can make me insane, completely crazy
I want someone who's gonna come and mess me up
And make me want him way too much
And sometimes hate me, sometimes love me
I want somebody, I want somebody

I want someone I can fight with
And then make up all night with
Someone who makes me mad and makes me laugh and has my back through it all
Someone who loves my flaws and loves me 'cause I'm crazy
When I feel ugly, they'll still love me
They'll still think I'm beautiful
And when I'm a mess, they'll still think I'm the best
I want somebody

Someone who knows when to stay away
Knows how to take my breath away
Knows that no one can love me better
What I need is, what I need is

Somebody I can bitch about
Somebody I can't live without
I want someone who's gonna make me insane, completely crazy
I want someone who's gonna come and mess me up and make me want him way too much
Sometimes hate me, sometimes love me
I want somebody, I want somebody

I want somebody who can make me insane, completely crazy
