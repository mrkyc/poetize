Caught you in the saddle with some Jolene
Looks like she lost a battle with Maybelline
I got an open mind but three-ways ain't my scene
I may not be from Tennessee but you know I got a lot of Dolly in me
And there's a Smokey Mountain law that says thou shalt not cheat

So take your truck and shove it
I know how much you love it
And it's a good thing, 'cause that's where you're moving to
I'm gonna pull that wig down off the shelf
Go high heels up with someone else
'Cause I ask myself, "What would Dolly Do?"
W-W-Double-D, W-W-Double-D, W-W-Double-D

Say where'd you find ole bumper lips
She should could use some beauty tips
And I could fix her up for good with my two fists
You're lucky I'm still taking meds 'cause I'd burn this house down 'round your head
I could shoot you too, but I'll pray for you instead

So take your truck and shove it
I know how much you love it
And it's a good thing, 'cause that's where you're moving to
I'm gonna pull that wig down off the shelf
Go high heels up with someone else
'Cause I ask myself, "What would Dolly Do?"
W-W-Double-D, W-W-Double-D, W-W-Double-D

Take your truck and shove it

Well I may look just like Barbie too
But this ain't my first barbecue
The question is, "What would Dolly Do?"
