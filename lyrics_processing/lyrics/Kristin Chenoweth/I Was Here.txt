I'll be leaving my mark
Like initials carved in an old oak tree
Just wait and see
Maybe I'll write like Twain wrote
Maybe I'll paint like Van Gogh
Cure the common cold, I don't know
But I'm ready to start 'cause I know in my heart
I wanna do something that matters
Say something different
Something that sets the whole world on its ear
I wanna do something better
With the time I was given
I wanna try to touch a few hearts in this life
Leave nothing less than something that says
I was here
I will prove you wrong
If you think I'm all talk, you're in for a shock
Cause this dream's too strong
And before too long
Maybe I'll compose symphonies
Maybe I'll fight for world peace
Cause I know it's my destiny
To leave more than a trace of myself in this place
