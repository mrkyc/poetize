All is well
We are friends, and that's swell
But the truth is that I
Have a secret to tell
I love you
People say it's wrong
It's absurd
That a frog and a bird are in love
But I know in my heart
This was so
Meant to be
Cause I love you so much
Too bad we can't touch
If we did you would die
And that would be such
A really big drag
If only we could hug and could kiss
It'd be heavenly bliss
But your lungs would explode
And you'd look just like this
As you'd hemorrhage and gag (oh... excuse me)
Romeo, Juliet, were in love
But I bet
It was nothing compared
To the feeling I get
Around you
But you don't even know that I'm there
You don't see that I care
Could it be, that for me
You're not even aware
That I'm perfect for you

And I'm sweeter than pie
And I'm thoughtful and gentle and timid and shy
And tender and loving and true
But darling I'll protect you, I will
Don't worry, just chill
Cause there isn't a bird
That I wouldn't kill for you
Can't you see
Oh, we were destined to be
For hear our love (love)
Poisonous love (love)
And oh, yes, I know that you can't hold me (feel me close now)
Your loving wings enfold me
Fate told me love
Poisonous love (love)
Standing here
You're so near and yet so far (like a star)
Here we are
What to do (to do)
Oh poo...
You're my Romeo
I'm Juliet
We're so perfect and yet
If we touch, not by much
Still and all you can bet
It's good bye
And I'll cry
As you die
