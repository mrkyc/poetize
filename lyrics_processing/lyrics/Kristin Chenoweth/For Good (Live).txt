That people come into our lives
For a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are lead to those
Who help us most to grow if we let them
And we help them in return
Well I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you (still me)
Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good
It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a hand print on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have rewritten mine
By being my friend
Like a ship blown from it's mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a sea dropped by a sky bird
Half way through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
But because I knew you

I have been changed for good
And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done
You blamed me for
But then, I guess
We know there's blame to share
And none of it seems to matter anymore
Like a comet pulled from orbit (Like a ship blown from it's mooring)
As it passes a sun (By a wind off the sea)
Like a stream that meets a boulder (Like a sea dropped by bird,)
Halfway through the wood (In the wood)
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
I do believe I have been changed for the better
And because I knew you
Because I knew you
Because I knew you
I have been changed
