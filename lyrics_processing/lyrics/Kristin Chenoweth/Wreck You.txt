And every thought that's on your mind
Tonight when you sleep
I wanna know you're dreamin' only of me
I want my kiss on your lips
And my touch on your fingertips
And I gotta know they'll be no other lover
I want you to think of me
And nothing else but me
I wanna be the one who wrecks you
And messes you up
I wanna leave you feelin' breathless
Needing only my touch
I wanna make you weak
And bring you to your knees
I wanna wreck you
I wanna take your breath away
And make it so you can't think straight
And I wanna do
All the things no one's done to you
I wanna spin your head around
And turn your whole world upside down
And I wanna prove you'll need no other lover
I want you to think of me
And nothing else but me
