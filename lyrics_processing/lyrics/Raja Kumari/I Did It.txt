I did it, I did it, I di-
I did it all by myself

I remember what they said
They tried to tell me that it can't be done
Can't take it from me when it's self made, huh
So raise a glass for the chosen one
And now I be working on and on it
You see me rising up this like the Sun
I pay my dues so I won't fade out

I'm one in the billion, we are not the same
You might feel the pressure but I'm diamond made

I did it, I did it, I di- I did it all by myself
I did it, I did it, I di-, I di- I don't need no help
Now who did it, you didn't get it
No, no, don't disrespect me
You had your minute
Now let me get it
I did it, I did it, I di- I did it all by myself
I did it, I did it, I di-, I di- I don't need no help
Now who did it, you didn't get it
No, no, don't disrespect me
You had your minute
Now let me get it
Dha te re ke te dha, dha dha dha
Dha te re ke te dha, dha dha dha
Now let me get it
Dha te re ke te dha dha dha dha
Dha te re ke te dha dha dha dha (Yeah)
Now let me get it, get it, get it

I got that juice and I won't waste it
I hit the ground and I run, run, run
I'm superhuman but they keep chasing
Everybody gunnin' for the champion
And you can say I took a long way
But I atleast still know where I'm from
That I'm mango juice from Bombay, Bombay, ay, ay

I'm one in the billion, we are not the same
You might feel the pressure but I'm diamond made

I did it, I did it, I di- I did it all by myself
I did it, I did it, I di-, I di- I don't need no help
Now who did it, you didn't get it
No, no, don't disrespect me
You had your minute
Now let me get it
I did it, I did it, I di- I did it all by myself
I did it, I did it, I di-, I di- I don't need no help
Now who did it, you didn't get it
No, no, don't disrespect me
You had your minute
Now let me get it, now let me get it
Now let me get it, now let me get it, get it, get it
Dha te re ke te dha, dha dha dha
Dha te re ke te dha, dha dha dha
Now let me get it, now let me get it
Dha te re ke te dha dha dha dha
Dha te re ke te dha dha dha dha (Yeah)
