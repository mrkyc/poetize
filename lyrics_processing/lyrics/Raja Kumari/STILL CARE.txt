I know you still care
I see you everywhere
I know you're still here

I know you still care (Still care)
I know you still care (Still care)
I know you still feel (Feel)
What the deal is (What the deal is)
I know you still care (Still care)
I know you still care (Still)
Wish you were still here (I know you do)
My shit is too real (Too real)
Boy, I know you still care (Still care)
I know you still care (Still)
Every time I come here (Come here)
They tell me when, where (Now how you feel?)
Know she used to be there (I knew she would)
I wouldn't interfere 'cause I knew the end was near
(I knew that you'd regret it all)
I just didn't care

I done let you take me through, let you hit me with the flu
Mama pray at the palisades to keep me 'way from you
Is it the slum that you're from or how you flip the one to two?
I hate to say, but I'm attracted to your fucked up attitude
Call me wife, but I know you fuck with least another two
In my mind, I know he just doin' what a gangsta do
Why am I sympathetic to him making me a fool?
Got me doing all type of shit that I would never do
Deep blue, Raja never be a see-through
Yeah, the numbers up, but the answer don't equal
Is this divine time or is this imperfect timing?
What needs defining is what's the position I'm in?
No more trips, no more swimming with fish out in Thailand
You can't see, you keep missing the flick in this diamond
I gotta say, my heart is thing
This ain't just another bitch that's rhyming

Oh, I get it now, is this the shit that Bey went through?
King Queen shit, but there will be no harem for you
There are lessons in the lessons, we gon' let that teach you
And I'ma stand like a goddess every time I greet you
Felt more pain than the words in my heart could say
No way I could take knowing you were never gon' change, gon' change
You could never change a man, that's the golden rule
Forever over options, it's so hard to choose
I had a couple options 'fore I got with you
I bet you think that losing me is an option, too
Ain't gon' lie, the love I have, I can't hold back
The way I got your back, she ain't gon' do that (Woo)
You say you miss what we had and you want it back
I hope I don't regret dropping this pin on Google Maps
I know you still care (Still care)
