(Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh)

One, two, one two, nah, killers don't talk
Make sure you don't get in our way
One, two, one two, my pillow don't talk
Make sure you don't get in our way
Get in our way, make sure you don't get in our way
Get in our way, make sure you don't get in our way

Pull up
Diamond bindi shining with the bangles out
Fuck pushing up in Bentley trucks
Only G6, bitch, you know them wheels is up, uh
Praise to my maker, got that Hindu guap
Only rings from a pharaoh, better be King Tut
Gully Gang in the sling, fucker test your luck
When the last time you seen a Hindustani stunt?
Third world shit for real
From the East End, never be shit if you sleep
Bitch resilient 'cause I break bread with a billion
Respect for my bloodline, the deceased
Send my Benjis over to Gandhi, and now we feast
King that, bring the crown back with the jewels
Yeah, you took that, but it's the get back, issa mood
Bitch, I chin-check, every syllable for the street
Yeah, the world blind but my third eye see the heat (Rrrah)

Crushed flax seeds in the green tea, life infinity
Breathe so much intensity 'til my nose bleed
I3 when she look at me, two versus three
Shiva, bitch, I never sleep, I'm a trinity
Smoke rings, sticky-icky ting, that Manali cream
Bomb with the native tongue, got that California heat
Of course he wanna eat me, sweet as lychee
But he ain't never caught a headshot from a genie
Like Coogi be on "Juicy," on that Biggie beat
Shook when they see a deity, we be army deep
Young Gods run with Kumaris, new monarchy
You could never live a day they see, thug odyssey
(Rrrah, check 'em out)
