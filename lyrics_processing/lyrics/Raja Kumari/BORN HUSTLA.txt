Mama said get out that bed and hurry
Gotta go make them dollas
Gotta hit 'em with that heat
Gotta give the streets that heat
Mama said get out that bed and hurry
Gotta go make them dollas
Gotta hit 'em with that heat (Born hustla)
Gotta give the streets that heat (Wicked)

Rigid, temp frigid
Get guap, phone ring-a-ding
Army duffle with big locks
Mo peak of sleep, Gucci on the feet
Thick socks, plane taking off
Paris is the drop, oui oui
Real one never sing for the opps
So the seams, so they never see the strings loose then get in a knot
Running paper routes, knowing that I can't trip up
Whole family drinks it from the sippy cup
Club going in, filled up with hooligans
Camouflage the evidence, now we on the move again
All type of contrabands, mixed with that shit, they pop
That don't distract what we came here to get, we locked
Respect my rasta boys, like to hold them Rugers (Rugers)
Know the Queen must retain them designated shooters (Shooters)
They want amnesty, I'ma show up army deep
Either way you put it, I'ma be a major chest piece

Jackpot, driver move the top (Move the top, top)
We done went from winter to the hot (To the hot, hot)
All the profits from he capers, we gon' stash that (Yeah)
All the profits from he capers, we gon' stash that
Young gods scheming on the block, (Scheming with it)
In their eyes, I could see Pac
Keep the money moving, I ain't here to look back (Nah)
Keep the money moving, I ain't here to look back (Uh)
I just gotta get back to the plane, get my flight to move
Hear they're tryna shut down everything, take my visa, too
Running down the terminal, I just made it through the gate
Operation still in full effect to the next state

Lights flashing on blue, canines on loose
Big boy with the green badge said the big bag won't go through (Go through)
Doo-doo-doo-doo (Rah), Desmond Tutu (Tutu)
Might have to do a nightcap on a red eye, Beirut
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot (Get low)
Oh shit, don't shoot
Intel said the currency and the wire all came through
Too hard to get killed (Yeah), just moved 8 mil (8 mil)
Tell 'em quick, send the bulletproof
And hurry up and get here (Get here)
