Oooooohhhh

They saying I'm the one
I already won
Running a marathon
I'm holding the baton
Female, she Micheal Jordan
Indian-American
I'm ringing the alarm
Bass dropping like a bomb
I'm like a pill to swallow
I got 'em sick and bothered
I'm in Balenciaga
Looking for my baby father
He probably moving product
Treat me right, I'm the supplier
Custom, this ain't made in China
Jaywalking in that new designer

Hear what I say
Gonna break It down
We got problems
And It's time to change (Change)
You might also likeSay what you want
Don't forget the plot
Let's live life like
It's the last day

Here we go!
Hey, hey
Get It In
Get It in
Get It in
I think you know
Hey, hey
Did 'em In
Did 'em In
Did 'em In
Yah, yah
Been told that we better play our part
Hit the switch!
I'mah, I'mah shine the light up In the dark
Here we go!
Hey, hey
Get It In
Get It in
Get It in
Yah, yah, yah
Oochie wally
Yah I did that
'Bout to pop It
Like a big tag
Got me running
With the big bag
Bet It on me
'Bout to break your mind

Can't touch me, I'm ice blocks
I'm too cold
Like a runny nose
I'm wiping up the these fake hoes
Dodging loop holes
I'm jumping out the window
On the tempo
I popped up like rambo
Speeding like the cops
My drop top don't move slow
Told 'em kick rocks
I'm sexy boss
Act like you know!
Big mama, In the building
Made 'em come out!
Only wanna talk about
The millis when I come round
Here what I say
Gonna break It down
We got problems
And It's time to change (Change)
Say what you want
Don't forget the plot
Let's live life like
It's the last day

Here we go!
Hey, hey
Get It In
Get It in
Get It in
I think you know
Hey, hey
Did 'em In
Did 'em In

Yah, yah
Been told that we better play our part
Hit the switch!
I'mah, I'mah shine the light up In the dark

'Bout to pop It
Like a big tag
Got me running
With the big bag
Get It In
