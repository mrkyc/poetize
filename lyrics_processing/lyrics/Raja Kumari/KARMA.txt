Put it up (Huh)
Fuck it up (Fuck it up)
Let it pop (Let it pop, pop)

Careful what you say, karma like a bitch (Ah)
Shots back at you like a rubber band (Ah)
Ha, don't believe what you see (Ah)
Now you're in way too deep (Ah)
The hand that you bite had the upper hand (Ah)
Karma kills you quicker than the reaper can (Ah)
Ha, don't believe what you see (Ah)
Ha, karma come in your sleep (Ah)

Make room for the queen of the Hindustan
Stand up for the Daughter of the King

Bloodshed, leak-out, if the play called, then get difficult
Third world mentality lethal, we be serious
No compromise the loyalty over the TV, watch
Fuck everything that bleeds, breathe, ain't at peace with us
All propaganda we do see, we just keep it hush
Still find it hard to sleep off the dreams of the Taj Mahal
Lost hearts running, seeking peace in these wicked streets
China got the whole world lock and key, what that really mean?
Bombs over jungles, run to temples, pray to Hanuman
Karma's all around us, burn to ashes, turn us back to dust

Careful what you say, karma like a bitch (Ah)
Shots back at you like a rubberband (Ah)
Ha, don't believe what you see (Ah)
Now you're in way too deep (Ah)
The hand that you bite had the upper hand (Ah)
Karma kills you quicker than the reaper can (Ah)
Ha, don't believe what you see (Ah)
Ha, karma come in your sleep (Ah)

Put it up
Fuck it up (Fuck it up)
Let it pop (Let it pop, pop)

1-1-1, that's the date that this all begun
There were challenges and roadblocks and now what?
Bitch, now we on
I see a fall coming on like the fall of Genghis Khan
I'm refusing to let 'em eat, act like it's Ramadan
Coming in threes, 110 degrees
Still, they don't believe what they see
Wu Tang Killa be sent from overseas
What is beef? When you looking in the eye of Raja
God keeps scales in balance, that's the law of karma
Pretty Pompeii didn't listen, what they say? It's too late
Watch the risk you take, sit and medicate, I educate
Nothing's new that's been created under the sun, ha
Out of seven billion, there is only one
Careful what you say, karma like a bitch (Ah)
Shots back at you like a rubberband (Ah)
Ha, don't believe what you see (Ah)
Now you're in way too deep (Ah)
The hand that you bite had the upper hand (Ah)
Karma kills you quicker than the reaper can (Ah)
Ha, don't believe what you see (Ah)
Ha, karma come in your sleep (Ah)
