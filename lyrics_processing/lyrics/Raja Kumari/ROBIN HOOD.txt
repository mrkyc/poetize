We need the money, money, money on the dot
We already paid the cost
We need the money, money, money 'round the clock
It shoulda been this way from the start

Life is like a symphony
Play your part, where's the harmony?
Tell me, where is your sympathy?
Bend your knee, this is royalty
I need more loyalty now
Break bread, pass around
We had to spring from the ground
We had to spring from the ground
In the heart of a tiger, pride is the fuel for the fire
We have to leave the bullets to the liars
Mankind have to eat to survive, yeah

We need the money, money, money on the dot
We already paid the cost
We need the money, money, money 'round the clock
It shoulda been this way from the start
Don't forget the youths in the slums, yeah
If you know the truth, why dem hungry?
We need the money, money, money 'round the clock
It shoulda been this way from the start, yeah

Cut this shit, this is symmetry
Reap what you sow when you plant a seed
Tell me, who is your family?
Different cloth, that's a different breed (Yeah, yeah)
Can't come underground, we run too deep
Trumpets, they sound from West to East
How many wars to make the peace?
How many wars to make the peace?
Heart of a lion, unbreakable like a diamond
If we under pressure, we keep shining
Just like the stars, we're aligning
