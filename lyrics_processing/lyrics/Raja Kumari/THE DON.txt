Yeah, took a little longer
But it made me stronger
Did it with honor
Said I was a gonner
Not the crown that she wanted
Is sitting right on her?
Took money out my pocket
Fuel out my rocket
And I didn't even stop it (Yeah)
Oh, you thought I had no options
Thought I wouldn't pop shit

I bet you thought
You'd do better than me
I bet you thought
I'd be dead in the streets, no where
Look what you done
You know you were wrong
Tell me who's the don
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you (La-la-la)
You might also like
Tell me who's the don
Tell me who's the don (La-la-la)
Put my people on, yah my people strong (La-la-la)
Don't be calling on my phone
Now that I be on (La-la-la)
Tell me who's the don
Tell me who's the don

I be putting putting in, putting in the work
Just like there's no tomorrow
I be earning them, burning them bills
No need to beg and borrow
And I know it's gonna make you sick
E-go is the hardest pill to swallow
Best know when I'm taking
This shit will get rockey, no Apollo
Shah Rule!

11:11, It's my time to go to the moon
Broke down the door & took over the room
You went to the loo, never said too-da-loo
On to the next, I married my goals, my family post, no becks
No time to reflect, when the money reflects
You're only a don if you're giving and getting respect
(Flex)
I bet you thought
You'd do better than me
I bet you thought
I'd be dead in the streets, no where
Look what you done
You know you were wrong
Tell me who's the don
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you (La-la-la)

Tell me who's the don
Tell me who's the don (La-la-la)
Put my people on, yah my people strong (La-la-la)
Don't be calling on my phone
Now that I be on (La-la-la)
Tell me who's the don
Tell me who's the don

Come see these money trees growing with ease
I'm chillin' like Koalas
And I earn in my, earn in my dreams, you know I sleep with Dollas!
Expensive taste I'm a Michellin star, got 'em hooked on my masala
They callin' me that I'm a Line king, 'cause I rock pride rock with a queen like Nala
(La-la-la)
Backhand with my net worth like Roger
Live and Die in LA, new pitch every day
I'm a dodger, and I bleed blue both sides of the water
Dead wrong, can't handle this woman
No King Kong, I'm certified lover like SRK
Bandra Don, King khan (King khan)

I bet you thought
You'd do better than me
I bet you thought
I'd be dead in the streets, no where
Look what you done
You know you were wrong
Tell me who's the don
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you thought
I bet you (La-la-la)

Tell me who's the don
Tell me who's the don (La-la-la)
Put my people on, yah my people strong (La-la-la)
Don't be calling on my phone
Now that I be on (La-la-la)
Tell me who's the don
