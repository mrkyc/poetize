I'm a go getter, I'ma go get it, get it
I'm a go getter, I'ma go get it, get it

You've been talking, tryna get in my head
Quit that bitching, uh
No more limits, I show you the exit
Keep it pushing

My vision, no lie, no stop 'til I die
Like a rocket, I'ma batter this bitch, I'ma do it (Yuh, yuh)
Hey, big city, big dreams, show 'em how it's done
Big story, big scenes, I'ma let it run
King's crown on the queen, I'm a champion
I am my own motivation

I just wanna live my life like me
I don't need your negativity
I already told you
I'm a go getter, I'ma go get it, get it
Never gonna give up on my dreams
Turn 'em into reality
