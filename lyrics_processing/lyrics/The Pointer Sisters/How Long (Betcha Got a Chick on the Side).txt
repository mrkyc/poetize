Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side!
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side!

I know you want us both and I know the reason why
(I know why you want her!)
I can give you so much lovin
(How much can money buy?)
But presents she can buy you
Last night you're in my arms
Tonight I'm all alone

How long (How long?)
Will this game go on?
How long? Oh, oh how long?


And it's plain, plain enough to see that
You're not the man for me
(I'll have to find another)
I can't keep playing games that keeps my heart in pain
(My sister saw you, brother)
I want to turn and walk away but it's harder to do
Than it is to say
You might also like
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side!

I betcha, I bet you got another
Yeah, you got a, a-got another lover!
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you with her twice!
I caught you, I caught you
I bet you treat her nice
Can she love you?
Can she love you like me?
Aww, can she love you?
Can she set you free?
I know you got another
Another chick on the side

It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure
(Oh how I'm gonna miss you)
I'll get over you, yes I'll find someone new
(I might break down and cry, cry, cry)
Each time I open up my heart
It seems to just get torn apart

Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side!

I just know you got a...
I know you got another
I know you got a, you got another lover
You got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know, I know, I know you got a chick on the side
Can she love you? Can she love you like me?
Can she love you? Can she set you free?

I saw you, don't you try to hide
Don't hide it from me, no no no
I saw you, don't you try to hide
Don't hide it from me, no no no
You thought you would hide it, hide it
