Make it worth all that we're doin'
We must take it all the way
Followed plans that we perfected
Get results so unexpected

Pleasin' yourself is better than pleasin' someone else
It won't be easy for me
It won't be easy for you
Don't stop or you will never know
We're gonna keep on pushin' 'til it all comes true
Think about what you wanna do
We're gonna make it
