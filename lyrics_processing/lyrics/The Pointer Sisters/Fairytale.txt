I'll pack up all my thin's and walk away
I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waitin' for so long
(So long)
I just found out there's somethin' wrong
(Somethin' is wrong)
Nothin' will get better if I stay
There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you
Now I'm walkin' out the door
(Walkin' out the door)
You used me, you've deceived me
(What you tryin' to do to me?)
And you never seem to need me
But I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go
(Oh no, no, no)

Seems I've been lost in a dream
Pretendin' that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
I've been lovin' you so long
(My love's so strong)
Don't think I'll even know how to forget you
(I can't forget you)
But now the way that thin's have been
I think I'm better off alone
Than to be with you
You don't love me, it's plain to see
You might also like
You played around, you broke my heart
Told me we would never part
But that wasn't true
So what else can I do but move on


I've been lovin' you so long
(My love's so strong)
Don't think I'll even know how to forget you
(I can't forget you)
But now the way that thin's have been
I think I'm better of alone
Than to be with you
You don't love me, it's plain to see

There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you
Now I'm walkin' out the door
(Walkin' out the door)
Oh, you used me, you deceived me
(What you tryin' to do to me?)
And you never seem to need me
But I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go
(Oh no, no, no)
Seems I've been lost in a dream
Pretendin' that you mine
Someday you'll open up your eyes
And realize that a good woman's hard to find
Yes, I've been lost in a dream
Pretendin' that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale

(I moved on)
Move on, got to move on
Move on, got to move on
Move on, got to move on
Move on, got to move on
Move on
Hit it, Nellie
