There's a little distance
A shadow of resistance
When I begin to dim the lights
Why the hesitation
Any reservations
You have will be erased tonight

Just let it take you where it wants to
Only a fool puts limitations on love
You can be evasive
But I can be persuasive
And I won't stop until I feel you move

Just a little closer
Just a little bit
Don't be scared
Don't be afraid to get
Just a little closer
And you'll see
Love is gonna be
Just a little closer
Ooh
You might also like
Now that's a little better
A little more together
I feel you starting to relax
We're gonna have a fine time
But boy, if you're the shy kind
I'll ask the stars to turn their backs

Just let it take us where it wants to
Only a fool puts limitations on love
Tell me that you're staying
And get around to saying
That you think it's time for me to move

Just a little closer
Just a little bit
Don't be scared
Don't be afraid to get
Just a little closer
And you'll see
Love is gonna be
Just a little closer
(Just a little closer, oh)

Ooh, hoo, yeah
Just a little closer
Just a little bit
Don't be scared
Don't be afraid to get
Just a little closer (Just a little closer)
And you'll see
Love is gonna be
Just a little closer
Just a little bit
Don't be scared
Don't be afraid to get (Don't be scared)
Just a little closer
And you'll see
Love is gonna be (I gotta, gotta have you)
Just a little closer (A little bit closer)
Just a little bit
Don't be scared
Don't be afraid to get (Come on)
Just a little closer
And you'll see
Love is gonna be (Gotta have you, baby)
Just a little closer (A little bit closer)
Just a little bit
Don't be scared
Don't be afraid of what you'll get
Just a little closer
And you'll see
Love is gonna be
Just a little closer
