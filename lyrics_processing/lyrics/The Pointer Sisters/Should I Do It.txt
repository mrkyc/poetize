I swore when he hurt me so
I wouldn't see him anymore
But today he called my name
Oh, I could feel the same old flame

Should I do it? Should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy? Is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight
Should I do it? Should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

I know when we're in his car
I couldn't go just so far
I wanna give him everything
So when I hear the telephone ring, yeah

Should I do it? Should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy? Is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight
Should I do it? Should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

Oh, I'm so lonely, and he's so fine
Maybe I should swallow my pride
Just one, one, one more time, yeah
Ooh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah


(I really got to know)
Should I do it? Should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy? Is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight
Should I do it? Should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

Should I do it? Should I do it? (Should I do it?)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (Oh, oh, should I do it?)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (Should I, should I walk away?)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (Oh, it's driving me crazy)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (Should I do it?)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (And you'll love him 'cause I do it)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (I really wanna love him)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (I don't know, should I do it?)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (I just don't know)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (I really, I really wanna love him)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (Driving me crazy)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (Yeah, it's driving me crazy)
Should I do it? Should I do it? (I just don't know)
