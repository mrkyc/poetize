Hey boy, you know I like what you fancy
Boy, I got a fire on my hands for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Say boy, you know the sweeter the candy
The more I want to buzz like a bee to you
Don't want just a tease from you
Heavy sighs on the telephone
Tell me how you like it in slo-mo
Better mean it 'cause I won't take no, no, woo

Woo, pound, pound, pound, I'm coming in
Woo, pound, pound, pound, I'm back again
Woo, pound, pound, pound, I want in
Woo, pound, pound, keeps a-knockin' on my face
It keeps knockin' on my feelin'
Knockin' on my face
It keeps knockin' on my face for you

Hey boy, no one else holds a candle
Or comes close to the way that you handle me
Ee, ee, ooh-wee
Show that you got good taste
Don't you let a good time waste
Just give it to me
I need, I need just what you feed me
Lip to lip and toe to toe
Can't get enough if I needed more
Better give it 'cause I won't let go, no

Woo, pound, pound, pound, I'm back again
Woo, pound, pound, pound, I want in
Woo, pound, pound, keeps a-knockin' on my face
It keeps knockin' on my feelin'
Knockin' on my face
It keeps knockin' on my face for you


Ooh-wee, when you're pounding on the street
Bet you're gonna see I'm the only one you think of
Ooh-wee, when it comes around to me
I'm the one you wanna get tonight
Ooh-wee, when you're pounding on the street
Bet you're gonna see I'm the only one you dream of
Ooh-wee, when it comes around to me
I'm the one you won't forget tonight (Oh yeah)

Hey boy, you got a fire on your hands here
Boy, I'm so wild for the things you do
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey boy, you see the sweeter the candy
Hey boy, you know the more I need to
Woo, pound, pound, pound, I'm back again
Woo, pound, pound, pound, I'm coming in

Woo, pound, pound, pound, it won't end
Woo, pound, pound, it keep a-knockin' on my face
