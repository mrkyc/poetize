I love the way you love to live
You love life, you're an inspiration
I love the way that you give
Your heart so freely, you're a sweet sensation
You're my invitation to

Happiness
You're full of sweet surprises
Happiness
You fill my heart's desire
More, more more, and more
And over, and over again
Keep that goodness coming

I love the way you watch the world
Through kind eyes, that's why you're never sad, sad
Things don't bother you like do's, don'ts or whys
You hold on to the good and you let the bad go on by

You're my happiness
I want your love forever
Happiness
Give me your love forever
More (Gotta give me some more)
More more (I need some more), and more
(Oh, gimme some more)
And over (And over), and over again
Keep that goodness coming
(Ooh, keep it coming)
