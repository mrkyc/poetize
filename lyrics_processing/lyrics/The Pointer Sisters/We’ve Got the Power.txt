I know the rules for foolish games
They only fill a heart with pain
We need a rest, a change of pace
Come take my heart to a silent place
Where our dreams run wild
The simple joy of a little child lives here
Telling us to hold on a little longer

We can climb a mountain
To the top of the world
We've got the power
We've got the power
To take us anywhere we wanna go
We can live forever
(Live forever)
At the top of the world
(At the top of the world)
We've got the power
Oh, We've got the power
To live our dreams chasing after rainbows

With what we have is where we start
And what we biuld or tear apart
Depends on what we gain or lose
What we reject and what we choose
When I see your smile
The simple joy of a baby child is born
Reminding us to hold on a little longer

We've got the power
Oh, we've got the power

Where our dreams run wild
