I've got a chip on my shoulder
With your name on it
(Knock it off)
So don't just stand there foolin'
If you don't want it
(Knock it off)
I say you're either a lover
Or you are a liar
So don't you push too hard
You're playing with fire

Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
Come on, dare me
I wanna take you on
I know I can't lose
I'll be loving you
If you just dare me

Looks like you're looking for trouble
And I'd say you found it
(You found it)
You'll have to come right through me
There's no way around it
(You found it)
I hope that lean hungry look
Means what it's saying
'Cause I'm just sitting on ready
Ready and waiting
You might also like
Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
Come on, dare me
I wanna take you on
I know I can't lose
And I'll be loving you
If you just dare me
(Come on and dare me)

If there's any truth
Behind your intentions
This night's gonna end up on fire
(You better believe it)
You better believe it
Ooh baby
Oh, dare me, dare me, dare me

Baby, make your move
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
Come on, dare me (Any time, any day)
I wanna take you on (Any day, any night)
I know I can't lose (Any way, anyhow)
I'll be loving you (I'll give you all I got)
If you just dare me
Baby, make your move
Step across the line (I'm gonna keep on loving you)
Touch me one more time (So big and bad)
Come on, dare me (Time to show me what you got)
I wanna take you on (I know)
I know I can't lose (I know I can't lose)
I'll be loving you (Be loving)
If you just dare me (Loving, loving)
Baby, make your move (Loving you)
Step across the line
Touch me one more time
Come on, dare me (Come on, darling)
I wanna take you on (Wanna take you on)
I know I can't lose (I can't lose)
I'll be loving you
