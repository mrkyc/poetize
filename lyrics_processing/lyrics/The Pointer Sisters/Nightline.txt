Calling on the nightline
Waking me up
Calling on the nightline
Can't get enough
Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Send it through the pipeline
What I like to hear

Every night around midnight
The call comes through
You're turning on my nightlight
'Cause you know what to do
I'll be waiting by the phone, alone

Calling on the nightline
Waking me up
Calling on the nightline
Can't get enough
Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Send it through the pipeline
What I like to hear
You might also like
Make it person to person, and heart to heart
'Cause darling, your flirtin' is sending up sparks
I'll be waiting by the phone, alone

Calling on the nightline
Getting me up
Calling on the nightline
Can't get enough
Call me on the nightline
Whisper in my ear
Send it through the pipeline
What I like to hear
