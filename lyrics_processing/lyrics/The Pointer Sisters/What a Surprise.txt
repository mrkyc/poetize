It was a hot summer night and I was just having fun
I thought you were too
Just the sound of your voice
Gave me sweet sensations
But I thought I couldn't win
I wouldn't let you in
How did you do it?
Didn't see it in your eyes
Your approach didn't let me know
You gave me time to think it over
And my mind's made up
I'm gonna give it up and let it go
(What a surprise)
You just came into my life
(What a surprise)
Here before my very eyes
(What a surprise)
Never thought I'd give my heart
(What a surprise)
You have taken every part
Like the coming of the night
You can count on me to always treat you right
I'm gonna do my part
Like the one that comes with dawn
I can count on you, you always turn me on
You open up my heart
You might also likeI was looking through the window
Tryin' to find a reason
Why I shouldn't let my feelings grow
Tenderly you touch me
So nice you didn't rush me
Tonight the world will know
(What a surprise)
Have you here before my eyes
(What a surprise)
You have captured me inside
(What a surprise)
Never thought I'd give my heart
(What a surprise)
You have captured every part
You  me on the telephone
Your conversation went on and on
Without a word I heard you say
That in your arms is where I belong
You were in charge, I was in love
You had me hooked and I didn't know
I loved your heart, you loved me slow
This won't be easy come easy go
(What a surprise)
Like a diamond in the sand
(What a surprise)
Oh what a very special man
(Such a surprise)
Just like magic you appear
(What a surprise)
Ooh it's so good to have you here
How did you do it?
Didn't see it in your eyes
Your approach didn't let me know
You gave me time to think it over
And my mind's made up
I'm gonna give it up and let it go
(What a surprise)
Never thought I'd go this far
(What a surprise)
Oh baby, you are my shining star
(What a surprise)
Suddenly it's all so clear
(What a surprise)
No more doubts and no more fear
(What a surprise)
Take me all the way
(What a surprise)
What a surprise, you're here with me today
(What a surprise)
Ooh baby, ooh baby
(What a surprise)
Your good lovin' makes me wanna shout
