Because my man had turned me down
Then we met and you can bet I knew from the first
You were my love
And that's when the old gray cloudburst
My heart really flew
The day you caught my eye
I hope that we two will never say "Good-bye."
Clouds of gray have silver linings when they reverse
I found your love and that's when the old gray cloudburst
Hey, baby.....
I'm gonna tell you 'bout your lovin'
And your kissn' and your huggin'
And your sweet turtle-dovin' pretty baby
I won't be satisfied til I hear 'em play
"Here comes the bride."
Listen to me baby and I don't mean maybe
Listen to my story
It's terrifficly true
I gotta find a way of telling you that I really go for you
I hope you really believe me baby 'cause I certainly do
'Cause you're thrillin' me, you're really
Really thrilling when you tell me that you probably got a kind of crush on me
That moves me, grooves me
How divine can one woman be?
Well little darlin'
You got me fallin'
You got me goofy and gay
I'm gonna get carried away
Just think, you're gonna be mine someday
Oh, let's spin a little
Park a little, stop a little
Spark a little
Live a little
Love a little
Maybe turtle-dove a little baby
Every time you hold me so near
Nobody loves me like you, dear
Let's stop a little, squeeze a little
Probably maybe tease a little
Try a little, sigh a little
Maybe have to cry a little bit
'cause to tell you the truth
I'm gonna love you and that's it
'Cause I love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
With all my heart
Oooh, listen to me while I say I let
A lotta little ladies get away
Because I know
I know pretty baby, I know
I know, pretty baby
I know you're the one, yes you're the one
I knew when I met you what a break it was to get you
When it's cloudy and gray and that's the worst
How do you cause the cloud to burst?
You got to find a lover
Find a lover, find a lover, find a lover
If it's silvery under clouds of gray
How do you chase the clouds away?
You gotta find a little girl
And make her love you a lot
Don't ever leave unless you flip your
Lid and really want to ruin the plot
Sounds easy does it?
Light as a breeze thru the trees
Boy, how pleasant was it?
Pleasant as one summer day, boy
It's so wonderful
What a love can do
Look at what love has done for you
Hey, I'm a lucky lover, lucky lover
I got the love you should discover
I was blue and I was always wearing a frown
Because my gal had turned me down
Then we met and you can bet I knew from the first
You were my love
And that's when the old gray cloudburst
Take a look at me
Boy take another look
Take another look
Take another look
Take another good, long, look at me
Love opened my eyes and now I see
Clouds of gray have silver linings when they reverse
I found your love
And that's when the old, gray, cloudburst
