Ohhh, here we are, this is...Another year's gone by
Ohhh, I want a bicycle (Merry Christmas.) with skates, 12-speed cruisers
Oh, I want a doll
And it's red too!
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout,  I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list, he's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He knows when you are sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
And he knows if you've been bad or good
So you better be good for goodness sake
(Oh, you better be good for goodness sake)
Ooh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout,  I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
