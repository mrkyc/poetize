Your lady needs to know, oh yeah
Oh, if you really love her
You know you got to tell her so, yes, you do
If you wanna get back your lady
Communicate for real, hey baby
Or ain't no way your lady's gonna find out
How you really feel, ooh
I was a young shy girl
I thought I found my world in you the day we met
You were so cool and wise
One look into your eyes and my heart started gettin' upset
Never had no trouble tellin' you I love you
But you never did me the same
You kept it all inside as if you had to hide your love
And that's a cryin' shame
Now we're apart, what can I do?
But get this message straight to you
If you wanna get back your lady
Your lady needs to know, oh, yeah
Oh, if you really love her
You know you got to tell her so, yes, you do

Take some time and figure out
If I'm the one you really miss
It's gettin' 4 a.m. and I'm lyin' here again
And I can't take much more of this
Didn't mean to hurt you, walk out and desert you
But I didn't know what else to do
It's just the chance I'm takin', hopin' I can wake you up
To what I'm goin' through
If you could find a way to start
The door's still open to my heart
If you wanna get back your lady
Your lady needs to know, oh yeah
Oh, if you really love her
You know you got to tell her so, yes, you do
If you wanna get back your lady
Communicate for real, hey baby
Or ain't no way your lady's gonna find out
How you really feel, ooh
If you wanna get back your lady
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh baby
If you wanna get back your lady
