Bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)
(Bye, bye)

I'm doin' this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby, come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
You might also like
Just hit me with the truth
Now girl, you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby, come on
I live for you and me
And now I've really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm giving up, I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason
For your love no more
Bye, Bye
I'm checkin out
I'm signin off
Don't wanna be the loser
And I've had enough
I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two
So I'm leavin' you behind
(Bye, bye, bye)
I don't wanna make it tough (Make it tough)
But I had enough
And it ain't no lie (Bye, bye, baby)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
(I don't wanna be a fool)
Just another player in your game for two
(In this game for two)
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
(Bye, bye)
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
Might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie
Bye, bye, bye
