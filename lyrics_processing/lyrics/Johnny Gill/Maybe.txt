Maybe your fault
Maybe unfair
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I care
Maybe we're through
Falling in love
Maybe we're lost
But I, I can't go on

What am I to do without you?
'Cause, baby, I'm a fool without you, ooh
But a fool in love with you

(Maybe I'm wrong) Maybe I'm wrong
(Maybe unfair) Maybe unfair
(Maybe I'm gone) I can't go on
(Maybe I'm there) Baby, I still care
(Where do I go?)
How did I get so confused?
When the morning comes
I'll still be with you
But when tomorrow is through
Are we? Maybe

'Cause I only wanna be with you, yeah

When the morning comes
I'll still be with you
But when tomorrow is through
Are we? Maybe
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna live my life
Living without you
But these tears I'm crying
I can't deny

(Maybe I'm wrong)
(Maybe unfair) Maybe unfair
(Maybe I'm gone) But I can't go on
(Maybe I'm there) Living without you
But you know deep in my heart I still care

Live without you

(Maybe unfair) Maybe just a little
(Maybe I'm gone)
(Maybe I'm there)
I'm just a silly old fool without you in my life
(Where do I go?)
You see these tears coming down from my face
(So confused)
But when tomorrow is through
