Said you're doin' fine, baby, yeah
Alright, yes

There's nothin' wrong with foreplay
My body's yours, have it in your way, mmm
Take your time, don't rush it, girl, ooh yeah
Do me right and rock my world

Please, touch me here (Touch me, baby), touch me there

Girl, get loose, let your love come down
(Let it come on down)
Your warmin' up, just turn me out
('Cause you're doin' fine, baby) Oh oh
Kiss my ear, kiss my neck, ha, ooh, mmm
The heat of the moment, you're at your best
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
