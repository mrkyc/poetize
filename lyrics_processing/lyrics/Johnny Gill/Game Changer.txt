You ain't ever gotta ask, never gotta question my love
I ain't never gonna let nothing come between us, us, baby
The way I see it, girl, we can rule the world
We can have whatever we want
It's not like you're not worth it, more than deserve it
Girl, when it comes down to love

You're a game changer (That's what you are), mhm
Girl, you changed the game for me, yeah
(Turn in my player card) Oh-oh, yeah
I'm out the game, you won my heart

Used to run around, always hanging out in them streets, ha
I was on the prowl
Trying to take down everything I would meet
Well, when you came along, baby girl, you changed it all
And stopped all my playing, I guess what I'm saying
Girl, when it comes down to love

You're a game changer (That's what you are), oh-ho
Girl, you changed the game for me, yeah
(That's what you are)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, you're a game changer
(That's what you are) Oh, yeah
Said you changed the game on me, yeah
(Turned in my player card) Oh-ho-oh-oh, yeah
I'm out the game, you won
