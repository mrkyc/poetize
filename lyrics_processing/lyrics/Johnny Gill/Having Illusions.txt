You were the only one, that I ever loved
And you promised you wouldn't break my heart
Oh, oh please, tell me how could you do this to me
Well, 'cause I've been having dreams of losing you
And somehow I don't know that dream came true
And I don't know if I could live alone
Oh, I can't believe that you still love me, baby
It's even possible that you would even care
But I know I can't forget that you let me down
And I can't believe you broke my heart

I'm having illusions, I'm losing my mind
I can't sleep at night 'cause I can't have my baby tonight
Yeah baby, I'm losing my mind
I need you in my life

So tell me how's it feel to know you've done some wrong
To someone who was right for you
Oh, how could it be that you just don't love me no more, yeah
Well, you've been telling everybody I, that I wasn't your type of guy
Well, you know damn well that you were down
Oh, is it sick to think that you even love me?
I've even had second thoughts that you even care
But I know I can't forget that you let me down
And I can't believe that you broke my heart
