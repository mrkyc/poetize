I never did believe in true love from the start
It's not for me, baby
Well, I never was intrigued by real love from the heart
It's just not me

Until you came around (Until I came around)
And changed my life (And I changed your life)
You never let me down (I never let you down)
You are always by my side (Always by your side)
And now love is a joy (Now love is a joy)
A perfect melody (A perfect melody)
And I just want to tell the world what you've done for me

Feels so much better
Better than the one love I know
Feels so much better
Know, oh-oh, much better, baby
Feels so much better
Better than the one love I know
Feels so much better
So much better

Baby, I can't believe that I've been such a fool
I could not see, baby
I never could conceive true love could even be
So good for me
