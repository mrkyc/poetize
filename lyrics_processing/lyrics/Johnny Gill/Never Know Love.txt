I would live my life for you
Only because I feel the need
Girl, I would die for you
Precious as gold, you are to me

And I betcha
That you never
Ever had real love to call your own
Love wouldn't let ya
Feel the pleasure
Don't put your love on hold
Don't be alone

You will never know love (Yeah)
If you don't open your heart (Yeah)
Come as you are
You will never know love (Never)
Until you open your heart
Make a new start

I'd sacrifice for you
Simply because you're heaven to me
Lay down my life for you
'Cause you are my world, my everything
