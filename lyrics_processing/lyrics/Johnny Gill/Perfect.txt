Oh, oh
Oh, oh, hey

Sometimes it's hard to understand the things you say, yeah
How you notice every little flaw on your face, oh yeah
You trippin' 'bout a couple extra pounds, let it ruin your mood, uh-huh, uh-huh
If only you could see what I see, you'd enjoy the view, hey

Look how you shining
Girl, you a diamond
You know you're priceless (You are)
You know you got that slow glow
I see your halo
In case you don't know, oh-oh

You may not think that you are perfect
Your lips, your eyes, your thighs
Does something to me
But girl, I'm telling you you're perfect
Your skin, your curves, your smile
That's on everything
And you ain't gotta have your hair did
Your nails done, no makeup on
Ooh, girl, I'm telling you you're perfect
Girl, you're so damn perfect
You're perfect for me
