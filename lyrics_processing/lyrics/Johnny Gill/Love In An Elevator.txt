Yeah, I wanna do whatever you want to

Let's make love (Yeah, yeah)
Love in an elevator (Yeah, oh oh)
There's no feeling greater
Than moving up and down (Let's make love)
There's no feeling greater
Than moving up and down

Please understand as I convey my mind
I feel that it's time
To explore our fantasy
Like The Staples, I wanna take you there
Suspended in the air
I don't care which floor you press
Just as long as you express love

Let's make love
Love in an elevator (There's no feeling greater, yeah)
There's no feeling greater
Than moving up and down (Let's make love)
Let's make love (Love)
Love in an elevator
There's no feeling greater (There's no feeling greater)
Than moving up and down
