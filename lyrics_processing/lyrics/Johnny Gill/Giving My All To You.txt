Oh...oh...oh...
Oh...oh...yeah, yeah
(Chorus)
Giving my all to you (Yeah)
Nothing else will do (Yeah, whoa, yeah)
Giving my all to you today
I wanna know (I wanna know) if you love me that way (If you love me that way)
(Verse 1)
Sometimes I feel
I don't know
Which way is up
Or which way is down
You make me feel
Like you're not for real
You play with my emotions
But I can't let you go
I've got this love burnin' deep down inside of me
Tellin' me that I should believe everything that you say
It's so hard to live a life with somebody day in, day out
I've got to know the truth
I can't be, I can't be just wastin' my time, so I'll be

Giving my all to you (Yes, I will)
Nothing else will do (Nothing else will do, I'll be)
Giving my all to you today (You today)
I wanna know if you love me that way
Giving my all to you (Giving my all)
Nothing else will do (Nothing else will do)
Giving my all to you today (Oh)
I wanna know if you love me that way
(Verse 2)
I'll make the moves
So you can see
How I wanna give my body
Desperately
This love is real
And I'll make it known
If we're made for each other
This feeling can't be wrong
So baby, be sure you want me with you tonight
'Cause I have no intention of being with someone else
I'm waiting for you, baby, come to me
I'll be the best to you
No one, no one can do the things that I'll do
(Chorus)
Giving my all to you (Yeah...I)
Nothing else will do (No one, no one)
Giving my all to you today
I wanna know (I wanna know ) if you love me that way
(If you love me that way, love me)
Giving my all to you (I...I...I...)
Nothing else will do (I know nothing in this whole wide world)
Giving my all to you today (Can ever do, ever do, oh)
I wanna know (I wanna know ) if you love me that way (If you love me that way)
(Bridge)
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Nothing else will do
Nothing else will do, eah...hey...
Oh...
I wanna know (I wanna know ) if you love me that way
(If you love me, baby, love me, baby, love me, baby)
(Chorus)
Giving my all to you (Giving my all to you)
(I'm giving my all, giving my all to you)
(I'm giving my all, giving my all, giving my all)
