You need a love that will not change
You want a lover to remain, forever yours
Oh, but you don't have to worry
You never have to fear
Through thick and thin I'll always be here

I'll be your bridge
Over and through troubled waters
You never have to face it alone
And when the world seems to treat you unfair
Baby, for you, I'll always be there

I won't be a fairweather friend
I'll be there 'til the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again
I won't be a fairweather friend
I'll be there 'til the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again
Woo

Sometimes I know it's rough for you
And then there are times you're feeling blue
Got so much pain
Oh, but I'm the kind of person who can take the hurt away
You'll never have to suffer again
