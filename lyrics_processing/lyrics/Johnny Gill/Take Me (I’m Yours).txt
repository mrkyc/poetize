I can remember all the things that you once said
My love was so satisfying
But now your love is slowly, slowly dying
I know what I've put you through
And I wanna make it up to you
Please forgive me, baby
Don't let it end this way
I swear I'll never lie
Just give it one more try

Take me, I'm yours (forever)
Take me, I'm yours (forever)
I was a fool to ever let your go
Please forgive me, baby, don't let it end this way
Girl, give me one more chance
Please take me back again

I tried to deny all the love I have inside
By running away from the truth
Knowing my love belongs to you, to you
Now here I stand alone, with my heart without a home
Please forgive me, baby
Don't leave or out on me
Girl, give me one more chance
To win your love again
