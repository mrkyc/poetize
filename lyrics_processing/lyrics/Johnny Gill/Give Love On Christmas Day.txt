People making lists, buying special gifts
Taking time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love
Yeah

People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
The man on the street and the couple upstairs
Want you to know there's one who cares
Give love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love
