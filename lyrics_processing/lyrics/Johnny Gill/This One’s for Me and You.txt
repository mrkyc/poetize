You're the sweetest thing, an easy song to sing
Your are like a work of art, so priceless to me
A timeless beauty from the movie screen, that never ever seems to fade
So baby put that glass down and turn the music up
It's like these words was written just for the two of us
Do you remember that day in September
When we fell in love
This one's for me and you
So let the record play
I love the way, it makes your body move
It sounds so good to me, reminds me of you
And when the record plays a melody, love fills up the room
It sounds so good to me, this one's for me and you
Girl we came so far, and beat out all the odds
They never thought we'd make it, but I knew it from the start
So let's celebrate
'Cause we got it good
A classic going down in history, feels just like we won the lottery
So baby put that glass down and turn music up
It's like these words was written just for the two of us
Do you remember that day in September
When we fell in love
