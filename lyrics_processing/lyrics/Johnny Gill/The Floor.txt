Hey...hey... hey hey hey
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah (oh yeah) ski-doody-doom-da-nah
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah (oh yeah) ski-doom-dah

Bottoms up, it's too hot in here
Where's the fire truck when you need one
I want a firm foundation, a knockout derriere
I can't believe that my eyes are gasping for air

Unlike before, so much to explore
All I need and more, I'm gonna hit the floor
No kids in the candy store, get a lollipop at the door
I won't be no more, I'm gonna hit the floor

A bedrocker (a bedrocker) anytime
Gotta keep, gotta keep it on the level
Lay it low (lay it low), with feet sky high (feet sky high)
When you drive a wide load, you better go for what you know

So much to explore, I'm gonna hit the floor

Earthquake shakes whenever you move
The word heartbreaker describes you
Nice full back, there just waitin' to score
A stallion to break, so whatever it takes
Got my boots, got my hat, got my ridin' pants
To enhance the romantic circumstance
With you, you, ahh, is all I want
Here we go, I'm gonna hit the floor, so much to explore
I'm gonna hit, I'm gonna hit, I'm gonna hit the floor
Come on, I'm gonna hit the floor
I won't be no more, I'm gonna hit the floor
I like, I like, you like, I like, you like

Soon as I hit the door, I won't be no more

However you want (yeah), however you need it (yeah)

Everybody come on, I'm gonna hit the floor
I want you to join me, hit the floor, come on
Grab me a lollipop at the door
Don't waste time, gonna hit the floor
Wild for a derrierre

Feet sky high (She's a bed rocker)
