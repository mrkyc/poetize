It's 12 o'clock twice a day, two things that'll never change
All the shit that I love the most, yeah, is all the shit that hurts me
Fuck a relationship, I'd rather fucking be lonely
'Cause I'ma fucking be lonely, even if you love me

Everything that's new gets sold, every diamond comes from coal
Sooner or later, I'ma fall asleep, yeah, in between, I'll be miserable

Woah, oh, can't stop feeling about it
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable
Ain't no other way around it
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah

Sun sets on the west side, west side
Every day grow up to a night
And the tide only fuck with the moon
Pink Floyd, meet me on the dark side
You don't get to hear when I'm yawning
Do I really gotta speak my mind?
Wanna wake up in the afternoon
With nobody laying by my side

Everything that's new gets sold, every diamond comes from coal
Sooner or later, I'ma fall asleep, yeah, in between, I'll be miserable
Am I the only one living a double life? Easy going and spiritual
Everybody's just born to die, look in the mirror at a miracle

Woah, oh, can't stop feeling about it
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable
Ain't no other way around it
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah

The whole world warming up, yeah
Do you hear the feet marching? Storming up, yeah
Try not to be so pesimistic
But when the elephant's in the room, it's hard to miss it
So hard to miss it, yeah, yeah

And I can't stop feeling about it
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah
Ain't no other way around it
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah, yeah, yeah
The inevitable, yeah
