Chargin' up when I plug in
Chargin' up when I plug in
Drainin' your energy
Drippin' all over me
Chargin' up when I plug in
Don't hold back when you feel it comin'
Love that electricity
Love it when you're chargin' me

Baby, woah, woah, woah, woah, charge me
Baby, woah, woah, woah, woah, charge me

When my battery gets low, you're my surge
I'll be right here when your body gets that urge
Keep me grounded, yeah, your love is my earth
All of your juices give me power reserve

Like a circuit in the wall, you're my source
Source of everything I'm missing from before
Before I understood, I didn't know the value
Now the value figured out I needed more

Ooh, connect up all of this while you're with me right here
Ooh, you're insulated like a circuit
Let me plug in, show me how you work it
Love the gridlock, keep that current right here

Like a circuit in the wall, you're my source
Source of everything I'm missing from before
Before I understood, I didn't know the value
Now the value figured out I needed more
Always needed more
