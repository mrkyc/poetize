Subjected to my system, reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interests, our trust was in our bank
That's where our hearts once stay
Then we got closer
Separated from my ex 'til we had closure
Ooh, every passing, feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands, my love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I won't need your grace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to me holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it

And now my achor won't shower you, forever and for me
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks be a fourth of July for life
As long as you stand right by my side
Keep growing closer throughout October
Ooh counting down, it's almost Christmas eve
Ooh seven days shy of New Year's eve
Then we'll be celebrating
You might also like
So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I won't need your grace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to be holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it
So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I won't need your grace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
