Laying alone in this bed with your t-shirt on
Can't get my face out this pillow, it smells like you
Turn on the radio, turn it off, what a sad song
I don't miss ya, I'm lying

Holdin' on, but I wanna let go
Keeping secrets but I want you to know
Go to call you, then I hang up the phone
So indecisive of me
All this coming in and out of my life
Got me going in and out of my mind
It's like my heart don't know how to decide

Can't live with you, can't live without you either
Don't wanna want you, but I need ya
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna leave ya
Can't get over us, stuck up underneath ya
I really hate that I love ya
Don't wanna want you, but I need ya
Can't live with you, can't live without you either

You came around when I needed my space
Walked out the door when I needed you here
Gotta spit out these feelings, they're such a bittersweet taste
Ain't no tears on my face, I'm lying
You might also like
Holdin' on, but I wanna let go
Keeping secrets but I want you to know
Go to call you, then I hang up the phone
So indecisive of me
All this coming in and out of my life
Got me going in and out of my mind
It's like my heart don't know how to decide

Can't live with you, can't live without you either
Don't wanna want you, but I need ya
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna leave ya
Can't get over us, stuck up underneath ya
I really hate that I love ya
Don't wanna want you, but I need ya
Can't live with you, can't live without you either

Oh nah
I can't live with you
I can't live without you
Oh-oh, oh nah
I can't live with you
I can't live without you
Oh-oh
Can't live with you, can't live without you either
Don't wanna want you, but I need ya
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna leave ya
Can't get over us, stuck up underneath ya
I really hate that I love ya
Don't wanna want you, but I need ya
Can't live with you, can't live without you either
