Happy birthday

I'ma make you work for it
I'ma make you work
I'ma make you work for it
I'ma make you work
Ooh, I'ma make you sweat for it
The good kind of hurt
I'ma make you work for it
I'ma make you work

You wanna turn me out
Wanna make me scream your name
You wanna be in full control
You don't want me to maintain
Who do you think you are?
Acting like you're in charge
Underestimating me
Thinking that I don't go hard

I'ma make you work for it
I'ma make you work
I'ma make you work for it
I'ma make you work
Ooh, I'ma make you sweat for it
The good kind of hurt
I'ma make you work for it
I'ma make you work
You might also like
Ooh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Ooh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah

Looks like the table's turned
Did you wanna tap out?
My theory's been confirmed
I can tell by the sound
You wanna take a break
'Cause I took your breath away
What happened to all the talk?
Now you ain't got nothing to say

I'ma make you work for it (I'ma make you work for it)
I'ma make you work (Oohh yeah)
I'ma make you work for it (That's how it's going down)
I'ma make you work (Yeah)
Ooh, I'ma make you sweat for it (I'ma make you sweat)
The good kind of hurt (Oooh)
I'ma make you work for it (I'ma make you work for it)
I'ma make you work (Hey)

What you about five, five?
You don't work no nine to five
A girl like you probably seen on a movie screen
Engagement rings, damn, you fine
That ass though, I make all the time
Been busy, you know how I grind
Pull up, I'ma slide it aside
Late night, spend the night
Fuck it, bath soap, bed silk
Sheets match my fur pillows
Copperfield, feel good, you know it's real
High up, this the high life
Playa real, check my highlights
Keep your heels on with hindsight
Handcuffs rolling sex dice
Sex, right, love love tonight
Got a whole list things to do, do to you
If it's alright, alright (Al-alright)
Submissive, you could beg for it (Go on beg for it)
Spread you legs, get ready for it (Get ready for it), yeah
I'ma make you work for it (Ready for it)
I'ma make you work (Yeah, get ready for it, used to make love too)
I'ma make you work for it (She beg for it, early mornin')
I'ma make you work (Early mornin', Ha!)
Ooh, I'ma make you sweat for it
The good kind of hurt
I'ma make you work for it
