From across the vast and open sea
Was it your sole mission to enchant me?
From across the ocean's wide expanse
You've drawn me into your mystical trance

Distant shore, oh-oh, oh-oh
Distant shore, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's like the closer I get the further I am
From your distant shore

(Your distant shore)

Your melodic voice carried by the wind
Your magical essence, the waves they bring in
Your exotic eyes, piercing through my heart
Your soft red lips, I'd dreamt how they'd part

I've pondered how your skin would shimmer
Under the glow of the setting sun in summer
The touch of your hand and its sweet caress
The scent of you hair, but now I digress
You might also like
From across the vast and open sea
Was it your sole mission to enchant me?
From across the ocean's wide expanse
You've drawn me into your mystical trance

Distant shore, oh-oh, oh-oh
Distant shore, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's like the closer I get the further I am
From your distant shore

(Your distant shore)
(Your distant shore)

I'd brave the storm and sail to you
I'd wade the brimming tides to get through
The ebb and flow of the surging surf
Tearing the heavens, to get to your turf

I've pondered how your skin would shimmer
Under the glow of the setting sun in summer
The touch of your hand and its sweet caress
The scent of you hair, but now I digress
From across the vast and open sea
Was it your sole mission to enchant me?
From across the ocean's wide expanse
You've drawn me into your mystical trance

Distant shore, oh-oh, oh-oh
Distant shore, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's like the closer I get the further I am
From your distant shore

Beaten and battered, I'd finally breach
Every challenge that kept me from your reach
And on that sandy and distant shore
I'll find you waiting with those parted lips I adore
Oh, ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It's like the closer I get, it's like the closer I get
It's like the closer I get the further I am
From your distant shore
(Your distant shore)
