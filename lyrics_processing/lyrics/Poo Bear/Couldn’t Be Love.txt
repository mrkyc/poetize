Everybody already knows
This couldn't be love
Couldn't be love
When I only see you three times a year
Enough is enough
This couldn't be love, couldn't be love, love
(Couldn't be love, love)

You were my lover, my half best friend
Like the sky on sight, we couldn't see the end, oh
You were a blessing, so content
I realize now what we had way back then, oh yeah

Something special, far from ordinary
So I proposed to you
Preparing to marry you
Then we got older, emotionally closer
Not in the physical, 'cause I moved away
Now, everybody knows

Everybody already knows
This couldn't be love (couldn't be love)
Couldn't be love (I don't understand it)
When I only see you three times a year (three times a year)
Enough is enough
This couldn't be love, couldn't be love, love
You might also like
Spent a whole lot on that ring, eh
Now it doesn't mean nothing anymore
(Couldn't be love, love)
I gave you my all, but I guess my all wasn't good enough, oh no
You were my perspective
The only objective
Was to satisfy and make you feel complete, yeah
So much neglection, in need of affection
I respected what you wanted it to be

We had something special
Something special, far from ordinary
Then I engaged to you so I wouldn't lose your love
Then we got older, emotionally closer
Not in the physical, 'cause I moved away
And everybody knows

Everybody already knows
This couldn't be love (couldn't be love)
Couldn't be love (don't know how way)
When I only see you three times a year (once every four months)
Enough is enough (no, you can't take it, girl)
This couldn't be love, couldn't be love, love
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na, na na na na na na
