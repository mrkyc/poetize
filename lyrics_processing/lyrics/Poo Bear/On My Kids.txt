Out here they tend to judge a nigga
Know what going on nigga
Know what I mean?
Aye, yay
Uh, yeah
Know what time it is
Huh, yeah
I was on the sofa every night
Had a attitude every morning
I always went to school with a problem
Yeah two will said it won't it
Living like a mother fuckin' author
Ain't nobody seen the big Sur
Ain't nobody add me was it good?
Ain't nobody add me help me 8
Walk up to the school smoking blunt
Walk up by that bitch around lunch
Trying to go sell me some dope
Glenwood showed me the ropes
Made shot, killed a pencil on me
Made shot, counting nigga with me
Made shot, caught the niggas off me
Feel like somebody's tryna off me
You might also likeFeelin' like a mother fuckin' man
Barely even got a pubic hair
Barely even made it through my teens
Guess I got some gangsta in my jeans
Tryna get in baby girl's jeans
Tryna find a way up out the sheets
Almost third, deal with it now
I almost made it out the biz
Told Tip I'm going to the top
Told Faye we fucking with the king
That hope that will in the street reside
We was in none the streets aligned
One thing I never do is lie
One thing I never do is fail
I done seen some real shit as well
One thing I never do is tell
On my kids
Took everything I had and turned it into something
Came up off the block, you never seen it coming, no no
I put it all on my kids, yeah
Put it all on my kids, yeah
I'll be sitting on a 100 mil before you know it
Already got the baddest biiih to help me grow it, yeah yeah
I put it all on my kids, yeah (all on my kids)
Put it all on my kids, yeah
I done had fights with my momma
I done had fights with my partner
I don't care we never cool
I'mma still kill something 'bout her
I done had a baby on my girl
I done had a son on my daughter
Feeling real un-fuckin-loyal
Drankin' really never feed the problem
Drugs never really feed the problem
Only made a bigger fuckin' problem
Now I'm trying to play the bigger man
So I'll suffocate 'em with the strength
I can't even make a happy song
I ain't feel that happy 'bout my life
'Til they blessed a nigga with a deal
I know God think I'm ungrateful
To top it off I suck at being faithful
Really not a good communicator
Really I 'sposed to be alone
Really all 'sposed to be the star
They done lied to us so long
We don't really know who we are
I don't really know what going on
Man, get Jesus on the phone
Man I had to bury my daddy
I ain't even know I had a daddy
I ain't even know I 'sposed to feel
I just know I had to keep it real
I just know some shit has gotta change
I just know it all would be the same
Same nigga came in broke
Same nigga leave without a thang
Took everything I had and turned it into something
Came up off the block, you never seen it coming, no no
I put it all on my kids, yeah
Put it all on my kids, yeah
I'll be sitting on a 100 mil before you know it
Already got the baddest biiih to help me grow it, yeah yeah
I put it all on my kids, yeah (all on my kids)
Put it all on my kids yeah
Put it all on my children
Every word I'm singing right now
All of my feelings
So you know it's real right now
All the way from nothing I came
To the sunshine from the rain
I put it all on my kids
