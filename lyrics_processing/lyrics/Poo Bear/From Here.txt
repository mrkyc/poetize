Closer, baby, I'm wearing my little limelight
Over, need me, I, I, never wanna think twice
No, no pressure, but I wanna feel like you making it happen
Oh whenever, you want me to ease up like a butterfly

Read my mind
Don't wanna, wanna say nothing to ya
Between the lines
Ooh baby, you could show me

You wanna call me baby
Stay flipping on me, baby
You wanna keep me, baby
Tell me where we go from here
Tell me where we go
Tell me where we go from here
Tell me where we go
Tell me where we go from here

Yeah, I like how we kick it (I like it)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it (I like it)
If it ain't love, what is it? (What is it?)
You don't gotta talk, just listen (yeah)
I can show you better than I can tell you (I can show you)
I can Dolce, Goyard or Chanel you (I can show you)
You don't gotta think twice, think twice (nope)
I can see it in your eyes, you wanna ride (uh)
I wanna call you baby, call me daddy
Call you freaky, call me nasty
Falling hard, I hope you catch me
I can make it legendary if you let me (yeah)
