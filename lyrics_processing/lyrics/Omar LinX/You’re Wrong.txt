There you stand, forgotten, and no one remembers
Cold as December and you thought I wouldn't know any better
But you were wrong, to think that I would drag you along
You thinkin' everything's a joke but you ain't laughin' along
I'll break your spirit, your spine, you will never survive
Cuz you a cynic, you a slime, you a waste of my time
I got that Balboa attitude, did all that I had to do
You may think you fly but you ain't on my altitude
This is your captain speaking, the seat-belt sign is on
We off to Ommz city, but you can ride along
Just stay seated, we're making it through the storm
We land in about an hour, be sure that you dress warm
When you cold and you broke and you struggle to cope
I take it all, steal your hope when it matters the most
I went from nothin' to bluffin', now I'm buzzin' ain't that something cousin
Stop frontin', I'm everything that you said I wasn't
 X2
I could never quit cuz' I wouldn't know how
Everyday I wake up, but I never look down
You should know that you're wrong
You better know that you're wrong

Fuck you mean I'm a fail nigga you ain't see the progress?
Went from a tadpole to a Lochness
All these rappers sayin' they drawers but won't wash em'
They clock stop watchin', And that was when a nigga dropped the auction
Still I came from no money
And I ain't sayin' that I'm ballin' I just gained a little more money
Learned from these foe dummies, crash test
It's black and yellow how I'm buzzin'
You should cap it, stencil up a classic
Content still could be vulgar, enthusiastic hunger, whiplash your bumper
I can say you're wrong cuz the power of a hater inspires all my songs
Damn I turn these shits into songs
Rather I turn these hits into bongs, high life
Soon my features gonna be raking in a better high price
How could I not glow walking on the water?
You should secure that boat, fresh to death
Boy, I'm that close
You might also like X2
I could never quit cuz' I wouldn't know how
Everyday I wake up, but I never look down
You should know that you're wrong
You better know that you're wrong

Check it, yeah, yeah
Summer to winter until I hit stardom
And now I'll never fall, that's why I skip autumn
That's why you fuckers could never figure me out
And for the record I am reckless I will spit in your house
You are pawns on my chessboard, I don't respect y'all
Ya'll pay the price for all the time that I've been slepped on
You think I won't you musta heard me all wrong
I burn that bridge when you on it, and the current is strong
Just accept that you are dead to me, It's time you let it be
I'll crush glass on your food, now that's a recipe
Remember me like, sticky and 'Em, with a grin on my face you ain't never gonna win
You are unevolved, irrelevant, wacker than you ever been
You try to play the game but can't fuck with my intelligence
For everything you ever did, we'll never reach a settlement
They try to come around, I just shut them down, tell them this
 X2
I could never quit cuz' I wouldn't know how
Everyday I wake up, but I never look down
You should know that you're wrong
