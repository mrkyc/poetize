Call me Mr. Spaceman, call me Mr. Mr Spaceman (a-an)
I been living in this world but I can't call it home
I belong up in the stars, there's a place I know
Call me Mr. Spaceman, call me Mr. Mr Spaceman (a-an)
I been living in this world but I can't call it home
I belong up in the stars, there's a place I know

(Yeah)
I've grown to learn your ways since I landed on this planet
Still I'm feeling out of place, don't you worry
I will manage
I will teach you bout the stars
This place and where we are
Gotta see it to believe it, or just not believe it all
Let my space boot hit the gas
Do it all, let me get you there
Move along, and since we here
Stay Strong, We ain't Scared
Pull up in a big ol' truck
With the AC on and the windows up
In the middle of winter like I don't give a fuck
I ain't in it to win it, I can't give this up
(Spaceman)
No we are not the same
My very presence is priceless, you are my vodka change
I'll be your guiding light, just hope you understand
I gotta blast off, now tell 'em who I am

You (You you) grow old, I grow strong
You go home, I go on
I'm unaffected by time, I never feel alone
I can't relate to these frauds, and all them silly songs
Oh that Louis Vuitton, Gucci, the list goes on
I'm drinking space whiskey, no you cannot afford it
A small swig of the bomb will kick your ass in orbit
Have you buzzing for weeks spinning like Saturn's rings
I'll be out with your freak telling her badder things (Better things)
It's time to leave this place, y'all better wish me luck
My spaceship's on a fritz, I gotta fix it up
Houston, I'm the problem, It's time to show and prove
They say I'm out this world, well tell me something new

Call me Mr. Spaceman, call me Mr. Mr Spaceman (a-an)
I been living in this world but I can't call it home

Sing it for me now, Woah x6
