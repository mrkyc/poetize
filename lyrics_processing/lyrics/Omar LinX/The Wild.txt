If I know the way
I know the wild
If I walked out for
I walked a mile
I did it my way all alone
I did it my way all along
If I know the way
I know the wild
If I walked out for
I walked a mile
I did it my way all alone
I did it my way all along

I'm that whiskey drinker
Never know what that boy thinkin'
Try to set sail to the sky but the boat sinkin'
Mud slingin'
I'm no good, that's my own opinion
You don't know that I'm loco till I'm swinging
Bitch bring it
Imma fight till the death
Imma take what's mine
In this life for the next
It's my time now
Say goodnight to the best
I just close my eyes let the dice do the rest
And my mind so Lucifer
I need my space cause my style so Jupiter
Lookin' at my team like there's nothing you could do to us
Nothing here is new to us
Where the fuck the love?
What?
Someone lied Cupider?
She called me crazy
But I think I put the work in
Madeleine up in the circus on a pole with a purpose
You can hear it in my verses this ain't good, this is perfect!
I don't second guess a thing
Motherfucker I am certain
Oh boy!

If I know the way

If I walked out for

If I know the way
I know the wild
If I walked out for
I walked a mile
I did it my way all alone
I did it my way all along

I can't tell if I'm living fast or dying slow
I can't help that I take up more than I can hold
If people wilding you hear the sirens, It's time to go
Before you caught in that melodrama, and I would know
A closed mouth don't get fed
If I don't see them green bags, best believe that I see red
Living out my life like I be dead
It'd take a 50 foot jet for me to get my fucking feet wet
Foot up in the door
Bring the type of trouble that you cowards can't afford
All up in your house like "I'm sorry, is this yours?"
Man, I'm sorry, this is war!
And there ain't no turning back
I done damage my report
It's like the angel on my shoulder is the monkey on my back
Wanna show me where to go, the others throw away the map
You should know
It's the jungle
That's the wild
This is trouble
I can show you them gorillas if you lookin' to get humbled
Oh boy
If I know the way
I know the wild
If I walked out for
I walked a mile
I did it my way all alone
I did it my way all along
If I know the way
I know the wild
If I walked out for
I walked a mile
I did it my way all alone
