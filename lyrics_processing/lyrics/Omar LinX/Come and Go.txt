Some friends that come and go
Move you out in the low
No need to talk about, I don't shout it out
Done with life on this road
Stayed when I should have gone
No need to talk about, I don't shout it out

Am I a monster? Can't seem to calm my conscience
They say I'm sick and I'm making these cowards nauseous
I've had that temper as long as I can remember
You're cooling off in the summer, I'm hot as June in December
Now what the fuck am I supposed to say?
I've been the underdog waiting for my supposed day
I put a hundred on anything that you fuckers play
You stab me in the back but you lookin' at me like nothings changed
But still I made a way, made a path
I set my sights on the summit and I ain't lookin' back
From no cheddar to Coachella to more cheddar
Forget the money, I'm gettin' love cause I flow better
This ain't no race but I know that I set the pace
Have these chumps on the chase since like way back in the day
Way back from the shadows, I put em all in they place
With a simple thought in my mind and I'm keeping all that I take

Fuck' lonely on the top, it's lonely on the way there
Y'all learnin' from the villians I promise you never play fair
There's no excuses, you had your twist on the rubiks
Your focus was on the fame, that shit was all an illusion
Tellin' y'all that you're losin, put it all in my music
If you just tuned then brace yourself for the movement
I do this often, I put the nail in the coffin
They question if I'm gonna make it, I open doors like a locksmith
I will not miss, everyday that I'm breathin
Make my way to the deep end there's nothing left to believe in
Always wait for the moment, timing is of the essence
Never mind what they say cause the truth is lost in the message
So they can judge me, ignore me, hate me or love me
Cause it gets ugly when music mixes with money
Just count your blessings, it's all a matter of time
I told you all my confessions I'm going out of my mind
