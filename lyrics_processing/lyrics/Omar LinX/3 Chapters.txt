The stories are true! I swear to you! I swear on everything I adore
Verse 1 
Check it, yeah, uh, yuh, yeh
Nobody home when I was young
I raised myself
No bedtime stories
Turned the page myself
I wrote this song stood up
And hit the stage myself
I never played myself
Could only blame myself
So I don't know if I'm a fuck up or prodigy
But I've accepted all these problems are a part of me
If I hurt you, then pardon me
My virtues are hard to see
But this is my life
So your view is obsolete
Now picture this
Young kid with a chip on his shoulder
Never cared for the future
He just lived for the moment
And all them teachers scorn me
Said "The kid is just hopeless"
I just grin, nobody wins till its over
You might also likeAnd I was angry at the world
Angry at the stars
Angrier than Mars
Damn, I gotta hand it to you ma
He felt broken inside
Once he opened his eyes
And saw the world for what it was
And not for what it hides
Chorus 
I got  eyes on the back of my head
They see the things I wish I never did or said
So won't you (lean?) down
Let me rest these weary eyes
Cus I get older and older with time
Verse 2 
Check it, uh, yuh, yeh, yeh
Now chapter two
I had to find my way
Lost every night and day
I had to pay the cost
There was no other way
Stubborn as can be
That's just something in me
You gotta pay your respects
Cus ain't nothing come free
Had to play by my rules
And lose by them
I had to beat it the hard way
And prove I did
I wouldn't listen in class
I would listen to rap
I used to listen to Pac
And saw the wisdom in that
It was the music that showed me
The strength of the mind
To be yourself, do you
And never step into line
Let the followers follow
The leaders lead
And I ain't got no problem
Let me be me
How I came up straight from the pack
Stay straight in my track
I never gave up
I'm grateful for that
They say life is a rollercoaster
Highs and lows
It's all a part of the ride
You gotta rise and fall
Chorus 
I got  eyes on the back of my head
They see the things I wish I never did or said
So won't you (lean?) down
Let me rest these weary eyes
Cus I get older and older with time
Verse 3 
Uh, yeah, uh, uh
Now chapter 3
That's loss, that's a mess
That's the reason I'm depressed
That's the grieving, I can feel it in my chest
Let's go
Bring it back just a while
That golden mile
No trials with God
Only summer smiles
Real soulful
Times were so hopeful
That peace of mind we all go through
That girl my heart was so close to
It's all gone, this no longer holds true
Cus people change, and perpetrate the perfect hate
Don't feel ashamed
They rigged the game
Like you're to blame
I'm at the stage where the cards have been laid
When you can't turn back
It's a part of the game
So when the kid got older
His heart got colder
The pressure of betrayal fell heavy on his shoulders
He moved like a soldier
Deep in a trench
They say "Watch out for love"
I can see what they meant
I see the expense (expanse?)
I see the pain eat at your friends
So when they lose something close
You can be there for them
Help them look for the light
On the darkest of days
And when the sun comes through
You can laugh and just say

I got  eyes on the back of my head
They see the things I wish I never did or said
So won't you (lean?) down
Let me rest these weary eyes
