It's the way the liquor pour
I got this night on lock
Like a figure four, planted like a sycamore
Shorty on my lap
You would wish that the bitch is yours
What you give just to live just a little more
It's in your thinking
It's you that limits your power
The wolf believe in himself
The sheep believe in the coward
See the weak in the masses
They've sold it off for some plastic
Nothing left here to see
It's time to lower the casket
Until the hour we rise and come to realize
That we're the ones that suffer from the suffering that we decide
I'll be living my life trying to escape
In this party next to the people that seem to stand in my way
Peter Pan in the flesh
I feel that I must confess
If you don't seem too perplexed
I'm clearly out of your depth
You might also likeClearly out of the box
I fear that I'm nearly lost
Before I take it too far
I wanna hear the applause

It's the way the liquor pour
I'll be living my life trying to escape (escape)
In this party next to the people
It's the way the liquor pour
I'll be living my life, (my life, my life, my life, my life, my life)
It's the way the liquor pour
I'll be living my life trying to escape (escape)
In this party next to the people
It's the way the liquor pour
I'll be living my life, (my life, my life, my life, my life, my life)

Have I presented an answer for all your endless questions?
Is my redemption solely based on my last impression?
If I were guessing I probably say that they think I'm reckless
I know it's true, I pay the price for a heavy message
I swear they'll get you if you don't deal well with pressure
But I could walk away now and leave it to my successor
I bet the weight would crush 'em, is that a vain assumption?
Is that my way of saying 'I'll see you soon, you know I'm coming'
That's why I live and breathe, sinking deep in this melody
Give me peace or a better piece, let it be for the never-be's
It's in my chemistry, it's always 80-proof
And they only want the lie if you mix it with the truth
On the rocks or out the box I've paid my dues
I swear to god, we all a loss, we're here to lose
Pessimistic or realistic, I just admit it
This optimism is never vivid, there's something missing

It's the way the liquor pour
I'll be living my life trying to escape (escape)
In this party next to the people
It's the way the liquor pour
I'll be living my life, (my life, my life, my life, my life, my life)
It's the way the liquor pour
I'll be living my life trying to escape (escape)
In this party next to the people
It's the way the liquor pour
I'll be living my life, (my life, my life, my life, my life, my life)

The summer turns cold
The blue sky fade
It's nothing scenic, just how I see it in my way
The summer turns cold
The blue sky fade
It's nothing scenic, just how I see it in my way
My way
It's nothing scenic, just how I see it in my way
My way
