You see I grew up as wild child
Played by my own rules
Stubborn as a motherfucker
I don't wanna go to school
Man class is are boring
Recess is old news
I just wanna chill and have fun like the motor dudes
So I did and I never gave in
With my back to the wind
In the roof of your grand
I was out for the sting
Where I wanted I went
When they told me I'd lose
I just told them i'd win
And I snuck out of class
Headed down the road
Ventured on home
Call me Indiana Ommz
Said I never look back
I just set my own path
I don't need the game planned
I can get my own map
Til girl means boy
And boy means girl
Never would've thought she would change his world
I remember that day when we met up in a range
You just looked me in the eye and you said one.. thing (thing, thing)

Verse 2
Don't you see what I am, see what I'm doing
This is my life, don't you see what I've ruined
Drown my gift, try my fate
Forgot my dream I lost my way
And there's nobody to blame, nobody to call to
I was doing fine, why the fuck did I involve you
Ready yes I am, I would never get the chance
To show you what I dreamt cause you'd never understand
I'm a cowboy by night, writer by the day
If I could find a saloon I can find my way
Earn my living with my with my own earned winnings
I could spend it all with me but I just can't stay
Now everything's gone, everything's lost
Promising to god I have paid my cost
Never would've thought she'd ever let us go
But she missing in my heart, I can feel it in my soul
Chorus
Show me love, who's got your hand on a button now
Showing love, who's got your hand on a button now
Verse 3
What's wrong, who cares
It's all wrong, cool sin
I've been wrong about everything you owe me
And if I had another chance, just to try it all again
Then you know you'd be looking at the old me
So if there's anything left, anything at all
Lemme write that song, that'd put you in my arms
I can see you a star, please don't shoot
Please, at the least, let me speak my truth
Its a little to late, she whispered in the wind
Wished you never left, it shouldn't be the end
She always on my mind when I'm thinking in my soul
When there's nothing left to drink and I'm sitting here alone
The cards are on the table, the odds are looking grim
Indebted to regret there's no profit in the wind
I told her what she meant, just hope she remembers that
