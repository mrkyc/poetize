Down
Don't, don't bring me (ah-ah) down
Don't, (bring) don't bring me down
Don't, (ah) don't bring me (ah-ah) down
Don't, (bring) don't bring me down
Don't, (ah) don't bring me (ah-ah) down
(Don't...)
Don't tell me our youth is running out, it's only just begun
Don't tell me our youth is running out, it's only just begun

It's in the stars
Everything from the bitter start
We play our part with a silly grin, like life is ours
And we were kids runnin' wild, so free to live
I see the changes like turning pages
How real is this?
But time is ticking,  you close your eyes and you listen for everything that you lost
Will surely add to your wisdom
Sure, they'll ask if I miss em
Tell em all that I do
How we used to smoke in the park and I'd tell em all that I knew
Get 'em into that zone
Bring 'em back to those days
In a lot of ways, ain't much has change I'm never actin' my age, but
Forever young
For every breath that'll fill my lungs
It's just a number, I'm getting younger, I'm never done
I mean that

Can't hold me back, I'm going to bat
Out the park, nothing wrong with that
It's been a while since I've been around
But I'm coming home, I owe you that
Hate to say that I'm growing up
All the chairs have been folded up
Packed away for a different stage
I know I'm young, but I'm old enough
Thinkin' back where we once met
Where we drank rum on that sunset
17, we made a scene
I didn't know what I loved yet
Home town, my own town
The backbone to my whole style
Chasing tail,  I hate to fail
I wish I knew what I know now
But I recollect that I'm coming next
They waiting around for their honored guest
It's 'bout time that I showed face
Tell father time he ain't got me yet
I'm too quick for them to tie me up
Don't play my odds, just try my luck
Can't be contained, I'm wild as fuck
If it sound buck, then sign me up
These fading beats
A thousand dreams
These fading beats
