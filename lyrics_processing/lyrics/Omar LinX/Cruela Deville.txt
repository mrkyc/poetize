6-9 Coupe De Ville
You know she gives me my thrills
She got the 22 inch wheels
I call her Cruela Deville
The way I feel, I feel so real
So real for you, you give me thrills
The way I feel, I feel so real
So real for you, Cruela Deville

Yeah
Remember me, take a page out of your memory
Who would think the road to hell would be so heavenly
It's Cruela and she gettin' to me
She says take a full ride (and?) set me free
What a dream, what a dream, what a dream
Gotta let it be, let it be, let it be
Let me turn her on and climb my seat
Put the volume on pump and just ride that beat
And we cruise all day from the light to the stars
True, that be wrote on a map like it's rightfully ours
She understand it, we runnin' low but we still (?) manage
(??) like she was tinted we never panic (??)
Just me and her call it Mrs. Deville
She got a hold on me and I'm under a spell
And we ride, and we roll, always there, wherever I go

January came slow that year, saw the road dust (?)
And when it snowed we were pulled to its cold touch
I fell in love with the way she puff on dutch (?)
Used to ride with it, shit was so clutch
So what is it, does she hide in a piston
It's uplifting, give me drive and ambition
Said it all come down to the cadillac pimpin
If you ain't been there then you haven't been living
He was a beamer, boy he was a beater
And she was lonely alone, the one teetering (?)
I remember we would cruise playing motown
Bass bumpin' through the subs, windows rolled down
She was my lucky Deville until she broke down
Now I see them push her through the streets of my home town
So I find on the road (?) and she's mine wherever I go
