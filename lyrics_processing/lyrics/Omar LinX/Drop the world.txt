They are wagging their finger saying
Laugh when they think they break me
Half of them couldn't keep my pace if I was out there waiting
I always said I'm doubtin', they don't know shit about me
They won't respect you 'til you hopping in that brand new Audi
But if it's hell want they got it baby, satans's present
I just hope they don't mind the heat off for the sake of heaven
I've come to get it Out For Blood, I am done pursuing
The time is now, so they focus on how I do it
I'm outta place, outta hand, outer space
And this bottle in my hand got me feelin out my face
So, you barely made the game, I make the season play
You can't handle the moment, I'm here to seize the day

I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head, yeah
Bitch I'mma pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head
See I could quit now and be a chump motherfucker
But I'd rather reload and just dump motherfucker
I'm on, motherfucker I'm on.. I'm on

I'm busy in the clouds, you in a cloud of dust
I'm in the G5, you missed the crowded bus
But I don't mean no harm, I'd rather work the beat
I knock out everyday, but never hurt the week
I stay inspired, my hunger keeping the fire living
I cook ambition, you are what you eat so I'm ambitious
My vision vivid, I see the mission it's clear as day
Just take a listen, it's business homie I'm on my way

Make it rain in this motherfucker
All I wanna do is hate on these motherfuckers
Cause the don't compare as far as I know
I'm eating their food, I'm taking it all

I've been left for dead, hung to dry, I've been out the count
From out the womb, out the school, right to out the house
And no one picked me up, they told me I would never get it
So I just took it, now I want my motherfucking credit
Ain't never gonna change my course
Full speed tunnel vision I'm a racing horse
I aim to kill, don't play to sport
I don't know what it is yall waiting for
Nobody gonna hold your hand, I did it
I stole my chance, I took it and ran I played them all
Yall small, yall shook, yall played the same
Fuck all your plans, go ahead go call your mans
Might as well call the ambulance, I break it down
I'll take you out, yall never really had a chance
I'm sorry, want more I can take it to war
I don't know what the fuck yall take me for
I'll give em mine, I'll take what's yours
I'll pull your plug from life support
I stayed hungry, nothing changed, they call me young shady
I don't give a fuck either way, no, pay me
I been involved, I played the part, I took the hits
I did it all, the waiting's off , now gimme this
