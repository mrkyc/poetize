Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth
You're the only one that wants me around
And I can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you, I don't believe in you and I

Go ahead and fill my drink up, you'll still be all I think of
We try and stay afloat, but know the weight will sink us
I say the problem's solved once you forget the question
But you go ask again cause you ain't learned your lesson
And to the heavens I promise you no regrets
But my mind's left in the past so that promise was never kept
To be honest I fell astray - call it lost on the way
So certain in my intentions, I thought that I'd never sway
But between the cameras flashing, I guess that it had to happen
The negatives to the perfect picture, I had to have them
And my collection consists of all that I had to take
We celebrating the sacrifices we had to make
We had to wait, unprepared for the loss
Oversold on the win and unaware of the cost
Cause I can write a song but can't unwrite my wrongs
I guess you live and learn, learn when the love is gone

Now here we are again, back from our dark descend
We'll keep this happiness going 'long as we all pretend
It seems we built this from nothing but broken dreams
These memories we'll forget but that's all that we hope to see
I got my future and it's ticking, life is yours if you live it
You wish you could plan it different but fuck it, that's how you miss it
I always hoped you would visit, always thought it was you
Always caught in the past cause it's all that I fucking knew
I mean, it's funny, ain't it? Guess it's all how you paint it
It's all that I really got, but it's all for the entertainment
The champagne's on the dresser, empty from all my efforts
The life of yesterday's party gets carried off on a stretcher
And here we standing like everything's how we planned it
But who're we kidding? We drinking so we don't panic
Drunk off that lucky 7, go ahead and tell the reverend
We fuckin' rock stars - call us Zeds Deppelin
