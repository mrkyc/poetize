That's 6 years that's 0-10
It's cuckoo how time fly
It's all love there's no end
I'm just counting out my blessing
Thank God in heaven
Throw the dice on the concrete it's all eleven
I'll Meet you up on the line
Outside of Keele station
West end till I die that's still the location
I'm more patient, but the same old me
The paint faded on the street but it's the same old scene
So where you go now?
You've been missing all summer
Just sent the wrong thing
To someone with your old number
You got me stressed out
Good thing imma head south
Flying out to Q Roo
Imma get some rest now
My money up things good, it's a blessed event
I remember steady stressing the rent
Well There go LinX reminiscing again
I'm just counting up the time that we spent
Where do I go now? X2
Alone in my hotel x2
I bought a one way ticket so we both can kick it like old times
We can make it alright
Drink until the sunrise
See you in a heart beat
Put you on the next flight
I bought a one way ticket so we both can kick it like old times X2
You might also likeI call a spade a spade I'll call you everyday
We must of tried to make it work at least a hundred ways
And some would say
I shoulda stayed
But something changed
So I could trade it for the world
And feel theres nothing gained
Just step back, remember to laugh
Keep your sense of humor baby
Wherever you at
All the things that I've been saying I said in the past
-Never was out for the doe
I know you better than that
Just Hold tight through the winter
Will make it a winner
Ain't a thing I wouldn't give ya
Just hope you consider
Everything I've been through
I'm trying to get better
Say what u want bout that
Long as u know I deliver
If my efforts ain't enough to be entertained
Hope you get the message since you left and you went away
We all playing the game
But The show staying the same
Jerry, George and Elaine
You Kramer to think I'd change
Where do I go now? X2
Alone in my hotel x2
I bought a one way ticket so we both can kick it like old times
We can make it alright
Drink until the sunrise
See you in a heart beat
Put you on the next flight
