Feels like there's something I owed you but you don't seem to know
It seems the theme of the moment is just to let it go
The seasons pass and I'm wondering where the summer went
I overthink the "what ifs" and everything that we could've been
It's been a moment since we spoke
You don't even call
And my intentions are clear
I'm tryna be a star
But in the meanwhile
I'll be hittin' redial
To paint a vivid picture
To everything that we'd be now
I'm standin' in the rain
I'm fillin' up my flask
Umbrella broken
But still I hold it - don't even ask
I'm trying to pull it together
Without a fucking clue
And I ain't get here lyin'
So Imma tell the truth
You might also likeA little chardonnay to ease the pain
They say it's nothing to forget
But you fear that you'll never be the same
So when you see me don't you worry 'bout the past
Said I'm always moving forward
But I'm coming right back

You might be lost today
But I'll be here to stay
It's the way your life be
The way your life be
So turn yourself around
I'll always hold you down
It's the way your life be
The way your life be

Yeah
And though I'm holdin' the planet I'm feelin' empty handed
Ain't no reason to panic I already did the damage
And here I'm thinkin' that I gotta let it pass
Gotta do this on my own 'cause we never gonna last
But would it have killed you to try? (killed you to try x2)
I feel hope when I look in your eyes
And all that money and pride that get pushed to the side
Or what money can't buy - Well what a surprise
I'm here to thank you for the moments that we spent together
I'll keep you on my fuckin' heart, you'll be there forever
And now I wonder how that spring will turn to summer
'Cause I'm only getting colder, don't know if I'm gon' recover
But toast to the better times
Drink for a brighter day
Know that you'll never be lost
Long as you find a way
I guess the journey is young
Keep it in mind
Let it all come together
We gon' see it with time

You might be lost today
But I'll be here to stay
It's the way your life be
The way your life be
So turn yourself around
I'll always hold you down
It's the way your life be
The way your life be

Here's what you bring
Something to sing
Somewhere to go
There's nowhere you haven't been
Trapped in the sky
Fall asleep in the clouds
My wings will hold me while I'm dreaming
I don't sleep with a doubt
I miss you that's for certain
Let me kiss you where you're hurtin'
I hate to miss the show
But they closin' up the curtains
So were you waitin' to see my face in the velvet seat?
Or did I spare you the trouble for you to tell me "Leave"?
I think I missed the boat, but in the mood to swim
I get across the moat, just let me be your king
I know I'm trouble but trouble ain't nothing new
I struggle to have you with me, there's nothing I wouldn't do
I wanna understand
Hope that we're understood
The time was never right
We did all that we could
I say those words but don't believe 'em
So don't believe me
We'll start this engine up again
The rest is easy

You might be lost today
But I'll be here to stay
It's the way your life be
The way your life be
So turn yourself around
I'll always hold you down
It's the way your life be
