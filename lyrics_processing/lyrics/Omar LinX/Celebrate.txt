Yeah, lookin' in the mirror like it's me or you
No facade, I see the truth
You don't see what's wrong, you don't see at all
Middle finger to the law, what are we to do
Stay calm and I keep it loose
What I do with you, that's undecided
I think I lost my fuckin' mind but I ain't tryin' to find it
I'll be damned if I go out quick
T.T. with the wick on lick
That motherfucker just like me
That motherfucker lit like me
Half of y'all ain't have a clue
I saw it coming, what I had to do
That's good for me and that's bad for you
Now how you like my attitude?

Like - fuck it, why they get me involved
I think I'm making the call
To walk away from it all
Like hell nah
And I'm like - fuck it
What they want me to do
Soon as I step in the room
Like I got something to prove
What, to you?
So I'm like - fuck it
I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate
I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate
Fuck it, I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate
I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate (celebrate)
Let 'em (hate) - c-c-celebrate
L-l-let 'em (hate)
I'ma celebrate

Dark dreams from what I've seen
No memories, just set it free
Kicked on the street at seventeen
My apathy's so bittersweet
It's my scene, let me set this up
You can second guess, I've said enough
They send 'em home with the best of luck
Just let it go and leave the rest to us
To the good times
To the dark nights and the downfalls
Oh this city mine, I make a toast to 'em in the town hall
Bottom's up to you bottom feeders
Pray for 'em and I send 'em home
No remorse, we stay on course
If the squad here, then we good to go

Fuck it, why they get me involved
I think I'm making the call
To walk away from it all
Like hell nah
And I'm like - fuck it
What they want me to do
Soon as I step in the room
Like I got something to prove
What, to you?
So I'm like - fuck it
I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate
I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate
Fuck it, I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate
I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate (celebrate)

Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate

Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate
I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate
I'ma celebrate
Let 'em hate, I'ma celebrate

Fuck it, why they get me involved
