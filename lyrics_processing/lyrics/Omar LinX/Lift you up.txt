I've had a tough go, I've come close
To throwing in the towel just to watch it unfold
Just another story untold
Sitting on the moon I think it's time for me to come home
It's the wrong ones that want the credit
You were there when no one was
The only one I won't forget it
She thinkin' maybe there's still hope for him
Just help me with the pieces
Will make his heart whole again

Lift you up
Won't let you down
Hold you high, yeah off the ground
You can always count on me
Honey, that's a guarantee
Lift you up
Won't let you go
Through the highs and through the lows
I'll be anything you need
Cuz' you're everything to me
Lift you up, lift you up
Let me lift you up
You might also like
That's how I came up
True love never gave up
All problems aside, we knew nothing would break us
Here's what I know now
You, all that I hold down
Don't switch up a thing
I still fuck with the old style
We came with nothing but big dreams in the junction
They talk of success and leave you out the discussion
Like I ain't sittin' here too
I'm throwin chips in to lose
You bet at your own discretion
Cuz' I'm just itchin' to move all in
And Jackie boy don' put the bottle down
I had to switch up to swimming seen' as I nearly drowned
I had to picture the vision as soon as I hit the ground
Waiting at the summit just stuntin'
Oh, you believe me now?
My hat's off to the real ones that really bout' it
They pick you up when you're out of luck I would never doubt it
Just keep your chin up the world full of us sinners
I've seen the greatest of people that
Came from humble beginnings
Oh boy
Lift you up
Won't let you down
Hold you high, yeah off the ground
You can always count on me
Honey, that's a guarantee
Lift you up
Won't let you go
Through the highs and through the lows
I'll be anything you need
Cuz' you're everything to me
Lift you up, lift you up

And when it's dark out
You'll light the way
I hope you know that
I'll always stay
Lift you up
Won't let you down
Hold you high, yeah off the ground
You can always count on me
Honey, that's a guarantee
Lift you up
Won't let you go
Through the highs and through the lows
I'll be anything you need
Cuz' you're everything to me
Lift you up, lift you up, lift you up
I wanna lift you up, let me lift you up
Lift you up, lift you up, lift you up
