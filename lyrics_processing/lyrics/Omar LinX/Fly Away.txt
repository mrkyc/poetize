What would you do if you someone offered you their pain?
Would you lend that man a hand or walk away?
Cause life is hard and you ain't gotta  share the weight
And when it's all said and done you gone end up in the rain
That's why we struggle for money power and greed
We goto war and under value our peace
We set our sights on change that'll that will never see
We Send em home with a key
At least you can let em dream
This for the kid in the war torn city
Put your hands together hands pray with me
But chances are that he won't heal your scars
You a little too and he late and he a little too far
But in your heart something tellin you to hang on
Sayin no matter what you stand for stand strong
I  see it all all see it clear in this sand storm
And They can tell you what they want but they damn  wrong
Thats why you tell em that you lookin for the door
When they lookin for you heart and you tell em that it's yours
And your never gonna let it go
Keep it on the pedestal
Right until the end
Before I fly
I'ma Let em know!

I know your life ain't is simple
I know I've been there before
Ive been down that road
When you gotta leave town
And you just can't take no more
When they all just seem to doubt you
And the world goes on without you
When the days go by and you locked inside
Just know you're not alone
Cause we all trying to fly away (Away, Away)
We all trying to fly away (Away, Away)
Verse 2
When they try and make you whisper but you wanna yell
Or they trying to get it out ya but you'll never tell
It doesn't really matter what I'm doing imma give em hell
Long as all my people on the boat then I am set to sail
I could take it all
But only took what I needed
The struggle can make you strong
It'll turn a bird to a Phoenix
Just Let em know that you can
And let em know that you mean it
The harder road is more Scenic
You gotta Trust me i see it
I believe it's in you
I believe it's the truth
I believe if you want it there's nothing you couldn't do
There's no one you couldn't face
There's nothing you couldn't stop
Stay ahead of the race, you're taking it to the top
- Breathing in outer space
You taking it to the stars
If you can handle the heat
Then you can take it that far
If you can handle the low than you can take it that high
Until the day that we go, I'll meet you up in the sky (I'll see you there)

And the world goes on without you
When the days go by and you locked inside
Just know you're not alone
