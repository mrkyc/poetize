It's time to wake up, let in that sunlight
And once you unwind, you let the past go
It leaves you wondering, what the fuck was I mad for?
Cause you can swing for the fences and cover your bases
I still find it amazing that people love and embrace it
All the time that I wasted, those moments tarnished and faded
From Jack Daniels and hatred but god dammit I made it
Now it's dreams for the weak of heart
If you only just believe this could be the start
I can show you all that's changed, you can see how far we've come
They can say the odds are slim, but I know that I'm the one
For my people in the gutter, pull yourself up on the road
Gotta push it to the limit, it's the only way to go
It's the only way to learn
When you try you never miss
You can fly without a passport, that's it
Gas poured, match lit

We a long way from home
Are we there yet?
A lot of blood sweat and tears
Are we there yet?
It's been a roller coaster ride
Are we there yet?
I can feel it in the air
I think we're there yeah
You might also likeLate nights, broken hearts
Rhyme books, torn apart
Old wounds, new scars
Waiting on that shootin' star
If you don't like it you should leave before you lose it all
No time to stop, fuck I'm jumping out a movin' car
Cause they can tell you that this life is hardly fair
But you ain't need the odds to win if you just focus and prepare
Focusing in the mirror, like I know it this is the year
Hope will conquer your fear, you just grab the wheel and you steer
Grab the world by the horns, tell the world what you want
You could settle for less, but something tell me you won't
They just coming to visit, the difference is that I live it
I am what I am on record, I couldn't be more specific
It's like I wrote 'em a book to scratch the surface
It winds around like the cursive that's filling up all these verses
Had to take it the furthest, I'm heating up like a furnace
I put it all on the line, you better believe it's worth it
Ol' boy
