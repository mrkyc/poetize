Tell me why I gotta to wait for
What I already paid for
Said I'm Audi like an a4
Just wanna get my things and I'll take off
Cause I don't owe you nothing but the late charge
I wonna get to sleep cause the day long
You wanna make peace but I hate ya (hate ya) (hate ya)
If you don't make like a tree
I'ma make like a chainsaw
What a day, what a change
I got a shit ton of bills that I gotta pay
I got to focus on my craft, or the bank is on my ass
If I told you what I owe, then you wouldn't know the half of it
Still I'm happy as could be, cause I'm writing to this beat
And I got enough to eat but
Man this shit is gettin' deep
And I find it hard to breathe, what you motherfuckers need?
Lifestyles of the reckless, young and arrested
Nothin' but a dream and a death wish
I can see what you left with
I can see your greed, I can see you invested
You might also likeStill you oughta know (Still you oughta know)
All that glitters ain't gold (All that glitters ain't gold)
I won't sell my soul, it won't be sold
I'll take it slow

All I see is red light, green light
Rewind, stop and go, stop and go
Red light, green light, rewind
Stop and go, stop and go

Yeah, well its the wrong way, down the right path
I did it my way, how you like that?
I could turn this all around with a night cap
I got a date with the devil, I'll be right back
I'll be right here, like I never left
I don't waste no time and I never rest
I'm just tryin' to see a dime, cause i live in debt
But I don't see the light, just a silhouette
This is sudden death, this is all I got
My one chance, one shot
One step at a time, 'til you on top
One step on a mine and you get boxed
Get killed, so long
Why it feels so good but it's so wrong?
Wanna shut down, turn off
Well she loved me, well that's her loss
Numb to the pain, locked it away
They want the sun, I want the shade
You are the one, just not today
I got a lot to do, I got a lot to say
Tryin' to get ahead but i'm stuck on red
Tryin' to see a green out a limousine
For now, i'm waiting at the light
Waiting for the world, waitin' for that light

All I see is red light, green light
Rewind, stop and go, stop and go
Red light, green light, rewind
Stop and go, stop and go

You ever felt so stuck that you had enough?
You ever felt so low that you let it go?
When there's no one left to trust and you runnin' out of luck
When you livin' in your truck but you can't pick up
As that day to day, all the good times all seem to fade away
When you want to give in, but it pay to play
I hate this place, I really need a change of pace
So it's my turn, everything I got, I've earned
It's the only way to go, it's how the fire burn
It's how I've learned, it's what I know now
You gotta take the heat, before it cools down
So I go on that rocky road
Yeah, whole lot of maybe when you gots to know
You can try to take off, but it's stop and go
Just don't lose heart, its possible

All I see is red light, green light
Rewind, stop and go, stop and go
Red light, green light, rewind
