Mic on
Lights dim
The crowd ready
Just like him
Liquor poured (Liquor poured)
Liquor drank (Liquor drank)
But this drink weak
So my heart do what that liquor can't
And it's off the couch
Up the stairs
Out the room
So prepared
Mind sharp and I'm so aware
That that stage dark and they feel me there (feel me there)
And I stare at them (And I stare at them)
And they stare at me (they stare at me)
But their eyes change
Like our lies change when they hear the beat
Now it's 'here we go'
Start the show
Outta hand
No control
You might also likePlant the seed in that pot of gold
It's impossible but we watch it grow
And it's looking like my kind of night
High as fuck but we outta sight
We tryin' to rage, ain't tryin' to fight
Let me light the wick to that dynamite
And they get it
We gon' catch fire in a minute
Nothin but the sky as the limit
Set it off, set it off
S'all in your mind
S'all in your mind
Are you with it
Someone just vibe with me
Get wild with me
They catchin' me like they dive with me
I'm out of town but I shut it down
Like your city is my city

It's why I do it (It's why I do it)
Cus it's really all that's left to me
But if you ask me (But if you ask me)
Would I steal a whole lot to keep(???)
It's why I do it (It's why I do it)
Cus it's really all that's left to me
But if you ask me (But if you ask me)
Would I steal a whole lot to keep(???)

I'm up all night till that sun light
And that hotel is my home life
There ain't no time for no foresight
I don't plan ahead, I just roll dice (rolldice)
How you think I feel (think I feel)
Pretty damn good (Pretty damn good)
I might be alone
But not for long
Cus' that pretty girl would
Shut the door when you come in
Promise me that you won't go
Lie to me like I lie to you
I always know but it's so close (so close)
But I don't slow
No hope for you Yoko
Oh no, cus' we both know
That there's more shows
And I'm so ghost (so go)
Did it all for the game
If you tryin' to go to town
Then you really goin' down
If you really goin' down
Live it up on the way
G-G-God forbid that I live
That I give it all I got
And I take a spin
If you wanna play the part
You should play to win
If you goin' for a ride
Count me in (count me in)

It's why I do it (It's why I do it)
Cus it's really all that's left to me
But if you ask me (But if you ask me)
Would I steal a whole lot to keep(???)
It's why I do it (It's why I do it)
Cus it's really all that's left to me
But if you ask me (But if you ask me)
