No I can't sleep
I know it'll never let me down
My mind races still I don't wanna touch the ground
I stay high in a room full of snakes
You doomed if you don't so I do what it takes

I've been off for days, and I can't think straight
And ever thought that I set aside is misplaced
Every fear, every doubt, every mistake
I know it all doesn't carry on in this place
Cause life is better with your eyes closed
When you dream you feel the peace you let it go and let the time slow
But I just hear the ticking
I'm always there to listen
The hand spins on the clock I never seem to miss it
Tic-Toc
I can't shut it off
My mind spinnin a mile a minute it never stops
I must be wired wrong, cause nothing feel right
I guess I'll never know, if this is real life
And what you need ain't what you get
All I need is a little sleep, a little dream, a little rest
Just to close my eyes and give the night away
I let the feelin go, do it every day

No I can't sleep
I know it'll never let me down
My mind races still I don't wanna touch the ground
I stay high in a room full of snakes
You doomed if you don't so I do what it takes
I got that telly flicked on and that celly flicked off
I got that belly sick going and I'm feelin pissed off
Cause every second is a second of regret
And I can never plan the week cause I don't know what to expect
What's next?
When you don't know the days are passing
The memories fade together and you don't know just what happened
Your friends they ignore ya or maybe it's paranoia
You feel the same well maybe you should enjoy it
Cause I don't trust nobody and myself
Do the math, add it up, that leaves nobody to help
I can sing a song bout the moon and the stars
Bout the dream and the sky and the truth in my heart
At this point I can't really see the meanin
There's nothing in the cars and there's nothing left to reason
Look into my eyes, nobody is home
Nobody is listenin, nobody but Ommz

No I can't sleep
I know it'll never let me down
My mind races still I don't wanna touch the ground
I stay high in a room full of snakes
