Please come on peace
We beseech you
Only a landing will teach them
Our earth may never survive
So do come, we beg you
Please interstellar policeman
Oh, won't you give us a sign
Give us a sign that we've reached you

They say I'm a success mama
I just put it on the track it's a wrap
Swear to god they obsessed mama
Oh they amazed I am so outer space
And the haters gon' hate
But i wish all the best mama
Cause I'm a beast
I'm a killer on the beat
Why they lookin at me strange
Someone tell em who i be
At the least they a fan
Let em know it's all peace
It don't matter where i am
I ain't never gon' leave
But shout out to young hooks
Shout out to DC
Shout out my city and the people that believe me
Cause we are gone like the moon in the morn
And the sun shine bright when
You used to the storm
But we off to the stars never return again
Neil Armstrong from the Moon?
Never heard of him...
No we don't play
We could do this all day and we never fit in
Cause we do it our way

I don't even try got the ship on auto pilot
They can't see what i do call it ultraviolet
Nah these chumps can't bite
I got em on a diet
I think i lost my mind but I ain't tryin to find it!
Now what i say
I'm just giving y'all a taste
I said that I'd deliver
Now the shipments on it itsways
A new a place
Where I'm living out my days
And they'll never weigh me down
Cause I live in outer space
But I got my shades on
I'm in the lime light
I'm here to silence all the critics
This is my life
There's no excuse
Ain't no question I'm the proof
Plus I'm on another planet
On a mission for the truth
With my finger on the trigger
I hope they thinking fast
When they think they got me figured
I just flip it on their ass
Cause I'm the future
I'm the present
I'm the past
I don't worry bout the tense
Cause I know I'm gon' last
