I used to chill with the Jetsons

Yeah
I'm about to fly, like I'm waiting in the airport
Feelin' alright, lookin' buzz like my hair short
It's all a trip when your head's in the sky
My judgement's clouded, see the red in my eyes
You in a building, I'm on a building, I'm King Kong
You own a building, I own a city, it's CitzOmz
I want a car that'll take me to the stars
A house on the moon, keep my thoughts on mars
Space Cowboy, the spaceship's spacious
LinX to Groundcontrol, I think we've made it
Thinkin' out the box
I think no shape can contain my thoughts
I'm against all odds
Press pause, I dare you
This bar, I spare you
I'm coming right back
So flick on a stereo

When I crush this game in the palm of my hand

You want love (want love)
I can toast to that
He wants to dance some more
Don't let 'em hold you back
He wanna lead this world
The dream is yours
And take off to a place you ain't been before
You want love (want love)
I can toast to that
He wants to dance some more
Don't let 'em hold you back
He wanna lead this world
The dream is yours
And take off to a place you ain't been before

I'm livin' a dream
So I sleep and work a 9 to 5
I wake up and you're all in a line of fire
And I don't mind what you want but I don't get it
This can't be life, yo I'm home, set it
I'm feeling nice
Got Patron on ice
I own a bottle and a bar
I can go all night
And if you can let it take you away (take you away)
Take a chance, get lost and escape for the day
Take off to a place where the sun is just another star
Where the problems of the world seem so far
Leave the past
Hit the real shot
Go and pop champagne by the hilltop
Give me a plan and a reason to breathe
And I'll show a dream that'll keep you asleep
'Cause mom said all I need was a college degree
But I can see my call, like caller ID

You want love (want love)
I can toast to that
He wants to dance some more
Don't let 'em hold you back
He wanna lead this world
The dream is yours
And take off to a place you ain't been before
You want love (want love)
I can toast to that
He wants to dance some more
Don't let 'em hold you back
He wanna lead this world
The dream is yours
