Let me just count my blessings
Look what I made from nothin'
God damn that shit's impressive
They say they need suggestions
But fail to hear the message
They say that time is money
I say my time's expensive
Forget the Lexus, the roady diamonds
And colby
I hose you down with the truth
And I swear that they all be phony
Trust me I know the kind
They slime up from behind
There's a jungle full of these slugs
That'll wind up on your mind
They all up in your ear
Hands all in your pockets
They suffocatin' your talent
And you don't know how to stop it
Vermin without a conscience
Watch your back and be cautious
Out to see you succeed
But never far from your profits
You might also likeNow I've been down this road before
Tryin' to see through that open door
But it's dark out and that fog thick
Now I don't really know what I'm lookin' for
But my eyes peeled cause I know the real
If you know the type, then you know the drill
No remorse, heart of steel
Out for blood, shoot to kill
Hey you, right there, I don't think that they are prepared
Run around like they not aware
I've been gone but I'm back I swear
Real talk, no lie, I don't know why they won't comply
Got the heat that they can't deny
Playing dumb, but they know it's on
Hey you, right there, I don't think that they are prepared
Run around like they not aware
I've been gone but I'm back I swear
Real talk, no lie, I don't know why they won't comply
Got the heat that they can't deny
Playing dumb, but they know it's on
It's funny how little I care
Still breathin' easy on limited air
Don't feed the demon I wake you up
I'll show you things that'll shake you up
Shut it down when I come to town
Seen the type from the underground
That truer life, those bright lights
I found a way on that other ride
Goin' down with a sinkin' ship
Make your peace, yeah this is it
It's been a ride, can't lie, it's just a game, hit or miss
Understand where I'm comin' from
No support, one on one
Team died where dreams die
It's your choice, fight or run
There's snakes up in this tall grass
Whiskey up my raw glass
A lot of hate with a hint of love
I'm out of class, no hall pass
No time for your dumb shit
Typin' quickly they run ship
You out of line, you made me laugh
Go get a cab, you drunk bitch
I get to work, and you go to sleep
Feel at home when I'm on the beat
I kill shit, so to speak
Straight born to win, stay on my feet
Been a while since you've been around
You see the boy, you bitter now
I'm on the bill, you in the crowd
I'm in demand, you in denial
Hey you, right there, I don't think that they are prepared
Run around like they not aware
I've been gone but I'm back I swear
Real talk, no lie, I don't know why they won't comply
Got the heat that they can't deny
Playing dumb, but they know it's on
Hey you, right there, I don't think that they are prepared
Run around like they not aware
I've been gone but I'm back I swear
Real talk, no lie, I don't know why they won't comply
Got the heat that they can't deny
