Sun, say it now

You all committed
I'm in your mind and you can't forget it
Don't try and fight it
It's catching fire and you gotta let it
Just let it breathe
Let it off of the leash
Caddy playing the 9
And let it off on the beat
Oh that's the truth
Nothing left here to do
I must be wasting my time if I ain't making the news
If I ain't making move
Then I ain't cover no ground
And I'm not doing my job if I ain't reppin' my town
But go figure, go home or go bigger
They can't handle the style homie they all bitter
They all lame looking red in the face
You better step into line before you get in the way
Cause I'm back baby
Back going to bat, baby
And that maybe the last time that you act, baby
There's no fronting, no ignoring the numbers
I'll make a fool outta winter
While making a circus of summer

Sun, say it now

It's something new I can feel it in the wind
See it in the sky, feel in my wings
See it in my eyes, I'mma keep it to the end
I don't need to roll again
Ain't no secret I'mma win
Cause my flow so handsome
Bars always on topic
Keep an ace in my sleeve
Flask in my back pocket
There's no excuses, no draws no loses
You can pray all that you want but you can't stop it
My skin thick and my heart weigh heavy
You're too late if you weren't born ready
Soon as they let me I'll be throwing confetti
Shit I'll be kissing the bride and this ain't even my wedding
Well that's a test to my character
Proof of my ill will
Sitting on the edge with these frauds but I'm still real
I stay busy when there's nothing to do
I've been to battle before so I got nothing to prove!
