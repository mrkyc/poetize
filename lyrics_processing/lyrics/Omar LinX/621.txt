6 miles to a problem
5 miles away, I don't need a lot of reasons
4 me to stay
3 times is bad luck
2 bad you changed, nowhere to go now
1 way to play
And one no you
2 bad you changed 
I don't wanna know you

6 ways
Some mistakes
Are Misplaced
I lost you
You find me
I'm not in the best place
But now we dreaming of the same things
Waiting
Only time tell
If I will play king
The courtyard full is of hatred
It's in your nature
Everybody proud until your time awaits you
2nd place
Just ain't my taste
And I just lack the patience
Go try your best
But I ain't worried about no altercation
Word to mama feelin' fado off that marijuana
Hand of God
Got me feelin' like I'm Maradona
Do what it takes
If you can't let it fade then get away
Don't love you like I loved you then
I love to win
She love to play life

3 times is bad luck
2 bad you changed, nowhere to go now
1 way to play
And one no you
2 bad you changed 
I don't wanna know you

I'm a spaceman outta orbit, outta order
The Dalai Lama couldn't see the aura
You got the building blocks
To touch the sky but need the mortar
You got some problems I can solve 'em
I'm your best supporter
Thought we were on the same page
You were on your way out
I was there a day late
If you could see what I see
You would see the whole world
Wouldn't care what they say
Go put the cash in
Go run it all
Cause I'm sick of acting
For all, I know there's a better way
But I miss the passion
The ice water in my veins
Slowly freezing up
I've seen enough
To focus on the blood
But never feel the cut
6 miles to a problem
5 miles away, I don't need a lot of reasons
4 me to stay
3 times is bad luck
2 bad you changed, nowhere to go now
1 way to play
And one no you
2 bad you changed
