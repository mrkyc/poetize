Well the weather man says it's going to be a hot one, heard it on the radio
Load up the boat, grab your girl if you got one, nice little breeze going to blow
Baby I'm on my way to come and get you, meet me at the end of your drive
Grab your shades and your string bikini and your Coppertone 45

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good times, girl let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet, honey let your hair down too
I know a spot down on the river, underneath the Sycamore tree
Save all your kisses, but bring on your sweet love, pour it all over me
All over me

We can build us a fire when we run out of daylight, let it light up your face
Lay on a blanket, listen to the river, get a little carried away
Well I can take a side kiss on your sweet lips, ain't going to want it to end
So when the morning comes, we'll roll on out, and do it all over again

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good times, girl let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet, honey let your hair down too
I know a spot down on the river, underneath the Sycamore tree
Save all your kisses, but bring on your sweet love, pour it all over me
All over me
