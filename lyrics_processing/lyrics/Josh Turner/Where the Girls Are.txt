Some girls want to go where the sun shines
Stir up a drink and a good time
Laying out on a towel in the sand
Texting her friends, working on a tan
Some are shaking pom poms for the fans in the bleachers
Dancing to the beat through the big loudspeakers
Some are at the mall just shopping for clothes
And all the boys, they just want to go

Where the girls are
No matter how far, they are
Miles away or across the street
Wherever they're at is where we want to be
Think about 'em night and day
Won't ever go away
I guess that's why we always try so hard
To get to where the girls are

Yeah, they're the reason any boy's ever college-bound
The fuel that keeps trucks heading into town
It's right around the age of thirteen
Been jumping hurdles, long just to see

I guess that's why we always try so hard
To get to where the girls are
To get to where the girls are

Underneath the stars or the hood of the car
In a church pet or a dive bar
Here or there
Or anywhere

Where the girls are
No matter how far
A hundred miles away or across the street
Wherever they're at is where we want to be

No matter how far, they are

Wherever they're at is where we want to be
Think about 'em night and day

To get to where the girls are
Where the girls are
Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get
To where the girls are
