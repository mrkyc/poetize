You say you're from a planet where the tea ain't sweet
You've never seen a chicken that's fried
You've never been up in a big ol' live oak tree
You've never heard of Charlie Pride
I'm feelin' sorry for you 'cause you've been missin' out
You made me realise how good my life is
Thank the Lord ...

I'm from the Deep South
Let me take you there
Streamin' down a back road like we don't care
I'm from the Deep South
We ain't meanin' no harm
Me and my baby makin' out in the barn
We ain't got much of nothin' but we sure is proud
Y'all better listen up
You heard it straight from my mouth

I'm from the Deep South
I'm from the Deep South

Down in the land of cotton in a front porch swing
That's where momma likes to shuck her corn
And I'll sit out there with her and sing her a tune
Playing on my old guitar
I'm in the church house every Sunday in the same ol' pew
After that we'll go and eat my favourite barbeque

I'm from the Deep South, yeah
I'm from the Deep South, yeah

I'll get all dress up and we'll go out on the town
I'll step it in my cowboy boots
We'll come back to the country and kick it back
Sit and talk about my roots
There's been seven generations livin' life on this land
And I thank my lucky stars that I was born a southern man

I'm from the Deep South
Let me take you there
Streamin' down a back road like we don't care
I'm from the Deep South
