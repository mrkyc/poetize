When I look in her eyes, it ain't no surprise
Sparks start a flying like the 4th of July
She gets me so hot, my heart starts a popping'
When we get to kissing, there ain't no stopping
When it comes to love, she ain't no slacker
My little darlin' is a firecracker

When I light the fuse, I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick
Son of a gun, she's fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She's a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a Firecracker

We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in heaven and it ain't no joke
But I'd sure hate to see it go up in smoke
We got a good thing going and it feels so right
She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

She goes off with a great big bang
Boys, I tell yea it's a beautiful thing
She takes off, you better hang on tight
She's a blonde bottle rocket in the middle of the night
When she makes love she's a heartattacker
My little darlin' is a Firecracker
