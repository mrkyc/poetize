Like any other would be country singing sensation
I had no visible means of transportation
One Saturday morning I was searching the ads
When I found one that I wanted and I wanted it bad
(He found one that he wanted and he wanted it bad)
I called up the salesmen, he said, c'mon in
I've got the Lincoln right here belonged to Loretta Lynn
The Coal Miner's Daughter used to drive it to town
It's yours for a song and five hundred down
(He said, it's yours for a song and five hundred down)

I said, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
I had no idea what that dealer was thinking
But he totted the note on Loretta Lynn's Lincoln

Well, I throwed my old guitar in that big back seat
And I steared her on out on to Dameron Street
Them other cars pulled over like the red sea had parted
It was then I had a vision of Dolly Parton
(Right there he had a vision of Dolly Parton)

Dolly said, slide over J Otis, let me take you downtown
Miss Loretta's waiting for us at the Orchid Lounge
I couldn't believe my ears, I couldn't believe my eyes
Why she was waving from the curb and we drove by
Well, we turned that big rig around, right on a dime
I ain't seen nothin' like that since Red Solvine (Red Solvine)
That's what Loretta was saying as she hopped in the back
Then she said, hey, Hoss, ain't this my old Cadillac
No mame, Miss Loretta, this ain't your Cadillac


I heard a tapping on the window as I woke up
Neath an old newspaper in my pickup truck
The policeman said, boy, you better hit the road jack
Get that bucket of bolts back across the tracks
Officer, this here's Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
(And he said) son, that ain't Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
Yeah, I was waking up and my dreams were sinkin'
Like them ol' springs on Loretta Lynn's Lincoln

Yeah, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln (Loretta, Loretta)
Whooo, Loretta Lynn's Lincoln
(That is Loretta Lynn's Lincoln)
If you ever get to wondering what I was a-dreaming
