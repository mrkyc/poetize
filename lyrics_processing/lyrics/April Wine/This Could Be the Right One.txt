This could be the right one, I've never felt love like this before
I'm actin' like a lover that's out of control
Makin' you promises and actin' a fool
I'm goin' through somethin' that I don't understand
I know that I need you and I'll do what I can, cause
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one (this could be the only one)
This could be the right one, this could be the one we're waiting for
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one
Won't you let me show you how nice it could be
I just wanna please you (I just wanna please you)
To give you pleasure is a pleasure for me
I've always tried to walk away from lovers
It's too big a heartache, when there's always another
I run for cover but I keep in touch
I've learned to care, but not too much, cause
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one (this could be the only one)
This could be the right one, this could be the one we're waiting for
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one

Wouldn't it be somethin' (wouldn't it be somethin')
Wouldn't it be somethin' if it happened to me and you
All the glory of a new romance
I never wanted to take that chance
Foresaking all caution, no need to pretend
We're caught in our passion, our fate in the wind, cause
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one (this could be the only one)
This could be the right one, this could be the one we're waiting for
You bring me up, you bring me down
You find the words to turn me around and around
Wait (wait), let's take our time, let's be sure
I say wait (wait), careful now, let's understand, what's in store, cause
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one (this could be the only one)
This could be the right one, this could be the one we're waiting for
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
You could be the only one (you could be the only one)
This could be the right one, this could be the one we're waiting for
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one (this could be the only one)
This could be the right one, this could be the one we're waiting for
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
