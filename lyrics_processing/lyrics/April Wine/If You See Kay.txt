And, the way she looked at me, drivin' me wild
She was dressed to kill in her five-inch heels
Her painted on satin pants
She had the look of need, like, give it to me
I decided I should take a chance
If you see Kay, tell her I want her
If you see Kay, tell her I need her
If you see Kay, tell her I want her, now
Her legs were long shapely, I could see her love was hot
And, when it came together, she'd give you all she's got
She had the walk of a woman on fire
Her eyes undressed my mind and soul
I woulda gladly bet my last ten bucks
In love she'd lose control
If you see Kay, tell her I want her
If you see Kay, tell her I need her
If you see Kay, tell her I want her, now, wooh!

I had her in my dreams, three times every night
Her love was so complete
Her love was warm and right
When I wake up in the morning
With this achin' in my heart
You can bet the need I'm feelin' is only just a start
I felt the pressure risin'
When I looked where she had been
By the time I gave up hope
She'd probably fall in love again
