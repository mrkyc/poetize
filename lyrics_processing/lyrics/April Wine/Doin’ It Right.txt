The Rock band's cookin', and the drummer's gettin' down
We're doin' it right on the wrong side of town
I know a place on the wrong side of town
The Rock band's cookin', and they're gettin' on down
The slot man's playin' like his soul's on fire
Movin' like a rumour on a telephone wire
Go rev up your Chevy, put your gas foot down
We're doin' it right on the wrong side of town
Doin' it right, doin' it right, doin' it right, doin' it right
The Rock band's cookin' and the drummer's gettin' down
We're doin' it right on the wrong side of town
There ain't no future gettin' magazine girls
Taken to the club with their hard lovin' thrills
No time for tears, trouble and sorrow
Rock 'n' Roll like there's no tomorrow
Turn off the tube and put your magazine down
We're doin' it right on the wrong side of the town
Doin' it right, doin' it right, doin' it right, doin' it right
The Rock band's cookin', and the drummer's gettin' down
We're doin' it right on the wrong side of town
Doin' it right on the wrong side of town
