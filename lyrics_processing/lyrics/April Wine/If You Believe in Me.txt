And love ain't real, just a picture in a frame
And all I need, is to look into your eyes
All I need is in your eyes
I don't know for sure if you feel the way I do
It's such a scary world, having lost in love with you
And all I'm thinkin' of, is where you are tonight
And all those things I wanna say to you
If you believe in me, your love will be safe with me
If you believe in me, the way that I believe in you
The tears of another day, soon will be washed away
If you believe in me, the way that I believe in you
I drive my car sometimes, when I'm runnin' from the pain
I drive so far, that I get lost in the rain
And even so, I still keep holdin' on
I can't believe how much I've been missing you
If you believe in me, your love will be safe with me
If you believe in me, the way that I believe in you
The tears of another day, soon will be swept away
If you believe in me, the way that I believe in you
And all I keep thinkin' about, all I keep dreamin' about
Is the love from you

If you believe in me, your love will be safe with me
If you believe in me, the way that I believe in you
The tears of another day, soon will be washed away
If you believe in me, the way that I believe in you
If you believe in me, your love will be safe with me
Whatever you need from me, know that I'll be here for you
The joy of another day, is only a breath away
