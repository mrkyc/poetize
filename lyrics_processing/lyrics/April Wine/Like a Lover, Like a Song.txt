When there's nothin' goin' on, and somethin' should be done
'Cause we believed for nothin' it seems
And, now it's ended broken-hearted
And, as anyone can see, there was no way we'd agree
And, we can get there if we try
And, I wanna live if I have to die
And, it'll come so sweet and softly, like a song
And, really turn me on, like a lover like a song
Really turn me on, turn me on
It seems there's somethin' deep inside of you
And, I can tell that you've been lonely
And, you've had hard times too
'Cause we believed for nothin', it seems
And, now it's shattered all apart, like a broken heart
It's the end, it's a start
And, we can get there if we try
And, I wanna live if I have to die
And, it'll come so sweet and softly, like a song
And, really turn me on, like a lover like a song
Really turn me on, really turn me on
And, there's somethin' inside that's been burnin'
And, there's somethin' inside I've been learnin'
And, I can't hide cause it's all over me
And, deep inside of you, inside of you
Deep inside of you, inside of you

When there's nothin' goin' on
And, somethin' should be done
'Cause we believed for nothin', it seems
And, now it's ended broken-hearted
And, as anyone can see, there was no way we'd agree
And, we can get there if we try
And, I wanna live if I have to die
And, here's a chance for you to see
What this pain's been doin' to me
And, I wanna lose it everyone
And, have a heartache on the run
And, we can get there if we try
And, I wanna live if I have to die
