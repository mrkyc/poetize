Verse one
I can't come up off that bullshit -tryin to feed my baby I got a judge that hate my lifestyle and my alibi say I'm crazy
My hood don't know no names so please don't bring that 'round here got two blue boys just like you and they buried in this ground here
Got a momma with a chip on her shoulder chick watch your mouth I'm older my streets get hotter than summer and that bitch named winter say I'm colder
Two rugers under my pillow posed to help sleep good how the fuck I'm gon sleep good when my hood still tryin to eat good
My baby momma ducked out how the fuck she duck out-raised my daughter by the "G"-code two of us and we thuged out they hated it oh they hated it ooh this industry hated it, gon lose your spot if you leave the game mmm them white boys hated it
My choppers they keep choppin
My bricks from the click keep droppin
Mo-shit from a bitch keep poppin
My hip to the hop keep rockin
My cookers they keep coookin
My lookers they keep lookin
Ain't no nigga on my team on shook
Ain't gon find my game in a book -I keep pushin
