Lyrics-Powerless (Pay The Fee)
Officer officer I rumble in the dark witcha never let my guard down you'll never see me walk witcha high as a kite again thinkin bout my mafi-men and how we back on top again don;t make me call my felons in we dug graves for many men while they sit and wonder why- tongue could never be their friend they simple men deserve to die we standin on the blocks and sh*t don't give a f*ck no more hustlin for bonafide stripes and cash out at the door
Chorus- {What if all of the people in the world just forgot about the powers that be...and we became the powerless got we just got a hour left here to breathe...who ever said.. that life is a gamble everybody get to play for free...you're just another simple Simon on assignment Powerless Pay The Fee}
My city's gone to hell and won;t return with the bible recite the scripture from the hood we live for ever peace to Michael Y'all live for all those the picket fences and the fog the powerless that still be tryin to see beyond the fog I run with wise guys my secrets play out in the movies the youngins get it twisted they get visits from goonies let's keep it real son but y'all don't know the real Dons tried to educate you all but all of y'all still dumb killings on the playground drugs sold to minors granny bugging Jesus daughter lost help me find her babies having babies momma's boy born a hater wanna be a emcee but can't read the paper instead he pulls a caper run up in the wrong house he snatchin everything til mafidonnas take 'em out an now we sending flowers to his family's funeral for a hour everybody their is who you know they whisper words and hope for comfort come swift and easy the dude was powerless and all the bosses want the fee collect it swiftly God forbid you see me (Powerless pay the fee)
Homey watch who your friends be I learned that from Biggie when I used to push that Benz 190 made in '93 my enemies is valuable I keep 'em for collateral I move 'em round like chess pieces on the board you're laughable you make it rain in night clubs and child support's pass due interrupting conversations I'm a boss who asked you huh? this inner circle keep the secrets like the bones do the closest friends keep you in the dark we own you them helicopters hover quick when I say so the birds'll fly the word was I can get the payload uh imagine this huh just for a moment if you can figure out why paparazzi snap the showmen think about it...think about...Time's up join the powerless you probably got a hour left our I just might be paranoid our you just might be right to stress wonder why we wear the vest with fifty of the counties best right inside the night club with hooded thugs and prior mess...Cameras ready? keep the story crooked though...where the baby mommas lady's night there we go keep' em liquored up they'll never get the story right keep the corners dark we powerful we hate the light too much attention we don't needed from the left or right a Silverberg sent a Bilderberg to own the night gave the order to the media on what to right ...next day the powerless got it got to bite
