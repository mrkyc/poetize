Trouble here tonight-
Back away from my bubble these boys around me trouble, I need one good reason to change the season from hot to cold I'm trouble I mean double audacity Somebody has to be
No sense asking me why
Cause if I up the party we gon hide the body never talk a-body that's why
I'm like Raful Edmond I'm quick to get Them I'm organized with my hits if she a friend of mine she gon rob you blind and then leave you dead in a ditch
I'm a D.C. boss if you wrong it cost a full clip I spit and that's it I'm on a plane the same day do it the same way do it again they trip
Nah I don't ride with no genocide killa I'm inside with them beats I'm a hidden catastrophe I might be the last to be dead and alive in these streets Keep asking me but I don't run I'm in plain sight my plane's height where the sun be and if they play that game to gun gun me I'm a take em to hell where the fun be
Chorus

Verse 2
Look up in the sky it is not a bird it might be a plane I'm a make it plane we are not the same when I shoot I aim I commit to pain 1 and 2 the brain
I'm a tell the judge I am not to blame he was just a lame shoulda known the game
Can you stand the rain new edition I'm uncrossable crucifixion
I am the reason they coming to listen
The judge and the jury I'm counting convictions
Lord- Hector
Now Say what you want but get yourself missin
They Justify all of my alibis boy you cannot live if I say you die I hug on your mama cause she gon cry and the neighborhood tell you I never lie
