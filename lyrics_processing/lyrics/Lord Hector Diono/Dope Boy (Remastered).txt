Uh uh uh
See I'm a product of broken dreams and bad habits they follow me
I hold my breath afraid to found out what it's bout to be
My boyhood childhood ain't yo business I keep it hush
I got family quick to kill anything that might get me touched
My demon time ain't the time I
Decide who gone live or die my crooked walk quick
To spark any torch you got lit let's ride
I let go somethings somethings I can't let say that twice
Like when your favorite rapper die cause he won't let go that vice
5 Plus 5 oh boy just do what I told ya

In 10 more years this world out here it gone show ya
When the light turn to dark
Don't let that dope get to know you
I wondered why thunder's rumble got under my skin I'm humbled
Sit in that corner rock back and forth I survived a jungle
I Can't sell white no more it won't take water like it used to
We ducking the ops yeah
They Makin more plans to come back and shoot you

I took some loses I counted them twice
But I get back up I'm back in the fight
I'm dragging my knuckles gorilla tonight
It ain't gone matter who wrong or who right
I was in darkness looking for light
I stand my own I'm a dog and I bite dog and bite
I heard you was blind I think I gave you sight
You don't owe me a thing I'm OG not a price
I'm living my life it's me till the end
You live how you live and you cannot pretend
The game was here when you thought you could win
And it's gone be here you lose in the end
