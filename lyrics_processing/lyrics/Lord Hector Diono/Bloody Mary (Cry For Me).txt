I don't know about the rest but it's bothering me
Ya see
I told my maker not to take me I'm too close to a win
Ya see
If you take me now I'm gonna miss my family and friends
Ya see
I was dying in that ICU where y'all cannot go
Somebody called my child and told her death was at my front door
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary cry for me
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary cry for me
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary cry for me
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary cry for me
Wish you could die for me
Why y'all let them bullets kill that baby holla at me
I ain't got no answers for you but it's bothering me
Listen, when I was six years old I lost my grandma and it still hurts
I'm still that little boy a part of me is lost in her dirt
I know a woman who lost her mother when she eight years old
One day they'll meet in heaven talk about the way things go
I love you mama why you bring me in this world so young
The evil scares me so I sold my soul to these guns
To these guns, to these guns
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary cry for me
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary cry for me
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary cry for me
Bloody Mary Bloody Mary cry for me
Wish you could die for me
I got scars like any hood figga holla at me
I don't need your Hallelujah don't go bothering me
If I got problems I I'm a solve em if I don't then oh well
It's just another chapter written in the book of this hell
I can't do it won't you cry for me
