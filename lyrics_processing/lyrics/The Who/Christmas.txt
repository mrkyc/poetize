Did you ever see the faces of the children? They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including Heaven's generosity
Peeping 'round the door to see
What parcels are for free in curiosity

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved from the eternal grave?

Surrounded by his friends
He sits so silently and unaware of anything
Playing poxy pinball, picks his nose
And smiles and pokes his tongue at everything
I believe in love, but how can men
Who've never seen light be enlightened?
Only if he's cured will his spirit's future level ever heighten

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is, yeah
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved from the eternal grave?

Can you, can you, can you hear me?
