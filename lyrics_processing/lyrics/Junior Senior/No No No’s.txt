No I won't fall in love
I won't fall in love
No I won't fall in love
I won't fall in love
No I won't fall in love
You wanna go but your mother tells you no
She was shunned so many years ago
And she doesn't
No she doesn't need to know
No I won't fall in love
So
You sneak out the door
And you got it all planned
To get backstage with the band
And you don't need no
You don't need no helping hand
Cuz you're into the boys in a rock n' roll band
Oh I won't fall in love
I won't fall in love (I won't fall in love)
No I won't fall in love (No no)
I won't fall in love (I won't fall in love)
No I won't fall in love
You might also likeYour heart is beating
And it's beating fast
Cuz the band's about to play at last
And I just took that
You don't get that backstage pass
He'll take you to bed or the backseat of his car
Cuz the motel's way too far
And then he'll go right back
He'll go right back to the bar
Cuz the night's not over for a rock n' roll star
No I won't fall in love (I said a no no no)
I won't fall in love (I won't fall in love)
No I won't fall in love
But you're a daddy's girl
One day your gonna runaway
I get it, woah
With your daddy's pearl
Yeah one day your gonna runaway
I get it, woah
With your daddy's pearl!
One day your gonna runaway
A run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run
Oh I won't fall in love (A no, a no)
I won't fall in love (Hey, I won't fall in love)
No I won't fall in love (No no no no no)
I won't fall in love (No no, yes!)
Oh! Ow!
(Guitar Solo)
