Whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah
This is going out to my special friend
She died from spouse abuse
This is her song I'm about to sing
And I also want to dedicate this
To all the ladies out there
Because spouse abuse is on up rising today
And we got to stop it, y'all
Come on
Check it out the story
Here we go

I never meant for you to die
Say I cried and I cried
I cried and I cried
My heart went out
When I found out
You might also likeWhen I found out that you were dead
It felt like I bled inside
I nearly died inside
It was gone
My soul was gone
My Julie rain

My Julie rain
My Julie rain
Damn, she's gone
I still can't believe it
Cause I didn't know the situation
Oh, how can she cover the pain
I remember the day we swam naked, yeah
It was a childish game
But Julie was so happy
The smile on her face was so pretty
Julie, Julie
Her smile was so pretty
She had the face of a goddess
And body of all bodies
A personality of all
How can he hurt someone so beautiful?
Julie
My Julie rain
My Julie rain
Julie

Listen
I know Julie would want me to sing her song
She was my friend until the end
I never had a friend like Julie
Julie truly
She came to my house one day
And oh
Her precious face was down and erased
I couldn't see her
I didn't know her
I don't know what's going on
I say, Julie
Who did this to you, Julie?
I don't understand why you let another man
Touch you
Beat you down
Do you wrong
Julie, let's do something about it
She said no, no
She didn't wanna go to the doctor
She didn't wanna look out for help
She didn't want me to help
But Julie
I should have did it anyway
Julie rain
Now you're dead, Julie rain
I'm so hurt
I lost to my best friend
I lost my best friend
