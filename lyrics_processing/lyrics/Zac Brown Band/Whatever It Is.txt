She got eyes that cut you like a knife
And her lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
And when she walks in the room, I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile, knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever wanna stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people ask me what it is, tell 'em I don't know
There's just something 'bout the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is
You might also like
'Cause when she loves me, girl, that's how I feel
'Cause when she loves me, I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me, know I can live forever
And when she loves me, I am untouchable

She got whatever it is, it blows me away
She's everything I wanna say to a woman, but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is, I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel, it comes out "I love you", I do
You got whatever it is
