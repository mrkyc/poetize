My first best friend was a 6 string
Took him with me everywhere I go
When I was 18, bought a Dodge van
Found a drummer and made the road my home

Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

Every Friday, you could find me
At Dixie Tavern, playin' with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end

Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today
You might also like
My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

We'd get 'em singin' "Don't Stop Believing"
Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreamin' one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night

Flyin' high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings

And roots, always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home
My roots, always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
My roots, even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
