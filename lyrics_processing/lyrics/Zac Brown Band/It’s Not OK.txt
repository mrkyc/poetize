A man was bothering me today
And I wanted to tell him to go away
But I stood and listened to him anyway, okay?
He said he didn't wanna shoot that man
And it was his thing and I wouldn't understand
And he had done all that he can, okay? Okay

I guess his body was as good as mine
And just like me he was wasting time
Turning every stone to see what he could find, okay?
He was filling tank and he asked for money
I lied and said I didn't have any
Then my conscience took over and I gave him a hand full of change

Don't do a thing (Don't do a thing)
Stay right there
You'll lie there (You'll lie there)
You don't seem to care
Yeah

I know it's hard to survive in the city
When beautiful days don't look so pretty
And you don't have windows to keep the night away, okay?
He was dirty and stinky and just a bit crude
But I didn't say that 'cause that's kind of rude
And he didn't care what I had to say in the first place, okay
You might also like
I wanted to say you're a big disgrace
To the world, yourself and the human race
And reach back and pop him one good time in the face, okay?
Naw, it's not okay and I didn't do that
But I gave him a smile and tipped my hat
And told him to have a very nice rest of the day

Don't do a thing (Don't do a thing)
Stay right there
You'll lie there (You'll lie there)
You don't seem to care
Get 'em

Well, I guess he bought some booze with it
And sure that bothers me a little bit
But it's his life and I can't tell him how to live it (That's right)
As he turned and started to go his way
I tried to think of something wise to say like

Don't do a thing (Don't do a thing)
Stay right there
You'll die there (You'll die there)
'Cause you don't seem to care
You'll die there (You'll die there)
