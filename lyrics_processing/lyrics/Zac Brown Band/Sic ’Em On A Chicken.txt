Aha, you thought we were done, huh?
We've got more

Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Break out the butter and the flour, we're ready to fry

My dog Pete's the smallest dog of all the dogs in my yard (That's right)
He's a mean sumbitch, drinks Beam and water from a broken mason jar

And we sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Break out the butter and the flour, we're ready to fry

I heard this awful noise coming out of the woods (Coming out of the woods)
I heard chicken screams, knew it wasn't gon' be good

I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken 'cause I just heard her cry
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
But you can get another one for a dollar seventy-nine

Over a couple of years his spurs have grown
He wasn't safe to keep around the home
When he almost took an eyeball from Lonny's son
And I was in the kitchen making fig preserves
And I heard that youngin getting kicked in the face
And I knew it was the day that that rooster was gonna get what he deserves

So I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken and Pete hit him from the side
I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken
Me and Pete suppered on a homemade chicken pot-pie

Well, sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
I can smell the kitchen and it's almost supper time
