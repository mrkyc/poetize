It was in a crystal bottle on his desk
He'd save it for the times to not forget
I missed the way he'd share with me
The things that he held true
While the lessons rolled around his 80 proof
All it took was...

One sip and it blew my mind
Those good ol' boys sure make it right
Knowing smooth whiskey takes some time
Ain't nothing like the real thing
And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everything is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby

I thought I'd been in love a time or two
Didn't know that I was lost till I met you
And I could tell that every other girl was history
Never knew how real could feel till you found me
All it took was...
You might also like
One kiss, and you blew my mind
An All-American kind of fine
You a know a, good woman is hard to find
Ain't nothing like the real thing
And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everyone is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

The real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing...

You know a, great song is hard to find
The right words and the perfect rhyme
'Cause we, all feel the same inside
We're all looking for the real thing
You know you're not the same once you hear it play
There's nothing else that can replace
What's genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing


Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
