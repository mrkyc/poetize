Early morning in a motel room
Sunshine trying to creep on through
Lost sleep but I found a tune
Stuck inside my head
Cigarettes and tank of gas
Headed off to nowhere fast
Got to find a way to make this feeling last

Because I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why
I just kept on chasing that melody
And as time goes by
It is funny how time can make you realize
We are running out of it

On the day that I die
I want to say that I
Was a man who really lived and never compromised
And when I have lived out my days
Until the very end
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands

Whoa, oh

A part of dawn to be ashamed of
But good people are supposed to be up
But I found peace with the path I took
As I lay down my head
Crossroads you got to choose
Which way do we win or lose
But every bone in my soul says I sing on through

Because I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why
I just kept on chasing that melody
And as time goes by
It is funny how time can make you realize
We are running out of it

On the day that I die
I want to say that I
Was a man who really lived and never compromised
And when I have lived out my days
Until the very end
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands
Whoa, oh
