Ain't no love, baby, like my baby's love
It's like burnin' fire, mm, shut up in my bones, I got to say it
Ain't no lonely days (Lonely days), mm, mm
Ain't no lonely nights (Lonely nights)
And everything that she does
You know the girl's alright (You know the girl's alright), I said

I ain't never, never found me a girl (I wouldn't lie about it, baby)
Never, never found me a girl (To squeeze me tight at night)
Never, never found me a girl (Hey, hey)
Nobody to love me like you do (I ain't lying about it, baby)
Love me like you do (Sweet baby)

Ain't no man got a sweet woman like me
She's everything in the world
One man could claim, let me say that
She's every poor boy's dream (Every poor boy's dream), uh-huh
And she's every very rich man's prayer (Every rich man's prayer)
I don't need no money, honey, because, you know
She's always there, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Never, never found me a girl (Somebody to keep me walking in my shoes)
Never, never found me a girl (She always brings me good news)
Never, never found me a girl, hey (I never found a girl)
To love me like you do, oh, baby
Love me like you do, baby, hey
You might also like

And here I stand with tears in my eyes (Never, never found me a girl)
And I'm caught by total surprise (Never, never found me a girl)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Never, never found me a girl)
To love me like you do (Oh, sweet baby)
Love me like you do (I ain't never found a girl, hey, hey, baby)

You do (You squeeze me tight, love me right, oh, baby)
You do (Got me walking in my shoes, uh-huh, yeah)
You do (Make me feel good, oh)
You do (You make me feel good, hey, hey, baby)
You do (I never, never, never, never, never)
