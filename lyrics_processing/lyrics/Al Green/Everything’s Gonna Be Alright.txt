Don't let this world mislead you
Don't you ever go astray
Trust in God's word and believe it 'cause it'll never pass away
We will see Him in his glory riding on the clouds of joy
Greeting us with open arms and peace forevermore

I know that everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like He said He would

For the true and good

Now when the sky is darkened
There will be no moonlight
We'll know the time has finally come
And He'll change the wrong to right
So if you're always searching
Trying to find the bottom line
Just give your love and life to God
He'll give you a peace of mind

I know that everything gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like He said He would
I said yeah, yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good
Play it
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back

That He'll return to take us home and fulfill the prophecy
