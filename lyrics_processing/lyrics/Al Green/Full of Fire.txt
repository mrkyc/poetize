I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
You're my one desire
Babe, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
You can make me cry
I can dance to the music
I can sing all night long
I can play with the band
Until you hear my song
'Cause I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
To see the party light
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
Think they're red and white
I can dance with the fire
Burnin', burnin' love
I can stay until the party is all over

Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And I'm over twenty-one
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And my life has just begun
You might also likeOoh ooh, I can dance to the music
Girl, I can understand
That there must be in life a power
That is holding my hand

Dance, dance, dance
Oh, I understand
Young lady, young man
I say I understand

Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And I'm over twenty-one

Young lady, young man

Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey, hey, and I can dance
