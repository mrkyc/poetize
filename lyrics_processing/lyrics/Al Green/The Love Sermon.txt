A grain of love is falling down on me
And time is there beside me
The carnival and the fair, oh, is here
Oh, having fun on the rides
Love is the dimension between time and feeling
Oh, the distance from heaven to Earth is close
Well, that's my understanding, haha
Lord, I, and I pray on, I pray on
I pray on
There's one thing I keep on looking for
My, my, my, my, my someone to collect the grains of sand
Ah-ha, cease the thought of times
Something is on my mind
I'm standing, I'm standing in a field of some diamonds
Ah-ha, oh, my soul and heart and my mind
I, I pray on, uh-huh
Let me say, little one, take my hand
Let us ask the, the Creator Man, uh-huh
To give us wisdom to understand, hey hey
What it feels to the be a man
And say
I want to do everything for you
That ordinary men won't do
I want to climb the highest mountain
I think it's big enough for two
Oh, come on
You might also like
If you won't go with me

In the right course of time, yeah

You should count all your blessings and
Let known your feelings for all your friends
Lord have mercy

Oh, that love and the miraculous day
Oh my my

In the right course of time

I wanna make a donation this evening to
All the good things in our hearts and our minds
That we know that we oughta do
Oh my my, I've got to try for higher ground
The Man said souls is coming down (Coming down), hey, oh
