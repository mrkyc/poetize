And I've learned that what you get ain't always what you see
And I've learned that politics and acting are the same profession
And the soul gets mighty sick when it goes without confession
I know a lot about livin' but I got so much to learn about love
I've learned that the winners don't always have the most talents
And often the most gifted lives fall out of balance
And I've learned that you can never lose if you don't give up
Don't give up
I know a lot about livin' but I've got so much to learn about love
Ooh, yes I do
'Cause when it comes to love
I get so confused
Things I say and shouldn't say
And do and shouldn't do
I build back walls that I've torn down
I hide my heart so it can't be found
I get lost as lost can be
Still you keep lovin' me
I've learned that I'm a taker and I need to be a giver
And I promise you a whole lot more than I deliver
An' I've learned that forgiveness is a simple gift of grace
And I know I don't deserve it, but I see it in your face
I know a lot about livin' but I've got so much to learn about love
Oh, yes I do
You might also like'Cause when it comes to love
I get so confused
Things I say and shouldn't say
And do and shouldn't do
I build back walls that I've torn down
I hide my heart so it can't be found
I get lost as lost can be
Ah, but still you keep lovin' me
I've learned that every day, miracles still happen
The sweetest music is the sound of children laughin'
And you should kiss your folks every time you leave 'em
'Cause you never know, it just might the last time you see 'em
I know a lot about livin' but I've got so much to learn about love
Ooh, yes I do
I know a lot about livin' but I've got so much to learn about love
Yes I do
Yes I do
I have to learn
Oh, I have to learn
Oh, I know a lot about livin' but I've got so much to learn about love
