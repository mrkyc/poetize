Been down this street so many times
Could hit the gas and close my eyes
And not touch a thing
The doorways here are always dark
Keep movin its not safe to park
This ain't no lovers lane
Its where infatuation goes
You hit this long strange stretch of road
And you dont know where it leads
But if were going anyhere
Only this will take us there
So baby hold your breath and wrap your arms around me
Here we go now
A little bit closer
Keep your head down
On my shoulder
Were on our way
But its gonna get rough
On this road
This road to Lasting Love
You might also likeLook into the rear veiw mirror
Remember all that got us here
Were gonna need it later
Out the window all around
Dreams in peices on the ground
Cuz it won't be easy baby
You know that faith and hope and trust
Ain't riding in these hearts with us
This trips gonna break em
Ive never seen the other side
But girl when you look in my eyes
Ive seen it out there
I beleive that we can make it baby
Here we go now
A little bit closer
Keep your head down
On my shoulder
Were on our way
But its gonna get rough
On this road
This road to Lasting Love
Theres a light up ahead that we all wanna reach
So we grab every chance that we can
But we lose and get lost
Just a few get across
This broken promise land
Here we go now
A little bit closer
Keep your head down
On my shoulder
Were on our way
But its gonna get rough
On this road
This road to Lasting Love
Here we go now
A little bit closer
Keep your head down
On my shoulder
Were on our way
But its gonna get rough
On this road
This road to Lasting Love
Road to lasting love
