Staring up at the ceiling
Your sweet perfume hangs in this room
And I can't shake these feelings
I still see you looking at me
With that wanting me look in your eyes
You're like a sweet melody
That just keeps haunting me
I can't get you out of my mind
You're burning a hole in my head
Lying alone in this bed
It's your touch it's your kiss girl
That's left me like this,baby what can I do?
You're burning a hole in my head
Reliving each word that you said
Needing you in my arms feeling you in my heart
Girl, I'm missing you
I keep telling myself everything that I felt
Was all in the moment
But each night's the same, girl
You left this flame and I just can't control it
You're like an unquenchable thirst
That just keeps getting worse all the time
You just won't go away all I see is your face
Every time I close my eyes
You might also likeYou're burning a hole in my head
Lying alone in this bed
It's your touch it's your kiss, girl
That's left me like this,baby what can I do?
You're burning a hole in my head
Reliving each word that you said
Needing you in my arms feeling you in my heart
Girl, I'm missing you
Can't believe this is me
Cause it's not like me before
But I know I can't let you go
When you keep on holding on
You're burning a hole in my head
Lying alone in this bed
It's your touch it's your kiss girl
That's left me like this,baby what can I do
You're burning a hole in my head
Lying alone in this bed
Needing you in my arms feeling you in my heart
Girl,I'm missing you
Burning a hole in my head a hole in my head
