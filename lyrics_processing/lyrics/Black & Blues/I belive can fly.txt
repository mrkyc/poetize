And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true Love
I'm leaning on the Everlasting Arms
If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me runnin' through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
See, I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
Oh, if I can see it (whoo!)
Then I can be it
If I just believe it
There's nothin' to it

I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me runnin' through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly... whoo!
Oh, I believe I can fly
Hey, Cause I believe in You
Ohhhhhh
If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it
There's nothin' to it
I believe I can fly... whoo!
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
See me runnin' through that open door
I believe I can fly (I can fly!)
I believe I can fly (I can fly!)
I believe I can fly
If I just spread my wings (I can fly!)
I can fly (I can fly!)
I can fly (I can fly!)
I can fly (I can fly!)
Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly ...(I can fly!) whoo!!
(I can fly!)
