I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't
Just string her along, it's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't

But what can I do? I'm lonely, too
And it makes me feel so good to know
(And it makes me feel so good to know)
She'll never leave me

I'm in way over my head
Now she thinks that I love her
(Yeah, yeah, she loves you)
Because that's what I said
Though I never think of her
(No, no, never think of her)

But what can I do? I'm lonely, too
And it makes me feel so good to know
(And it makes me feel so good to know)
She'll never leave me
You might also like
Every time I see that girl
You know I wanna lay down and die
But I really need that girl
Though I'm livin' a lie (Though I'm livin' a lie)
It makes me wanna cry

I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't
Just string her along, it's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't

But what can I do? I'm lonely, too
And it makes me feel so good to know
(And it makes me feel so good to know)
She'll never leave me (To know, know)


But what can I do? I'm lonely, too
Yeah, and it makes me feel so good to know
She'll never leave me
Every time I see that girl
You know I wanna lay down and die
But I really need that girl
Though I'm livin' a lie (Though I'm livin' a lie)
It makes me wanna cry

I saw her, I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't (No, no)
Just string her along, it's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't (You say you wouldn't)

I'm in way over my head
Now she thinks that I love her (Yeah, yeah, she loves you)
