Early in the mornin', she hitched a ride down to Louisville
Holdin' onto a hundred dollar bill
Dressed herself like a Cajun Queen in New Orleans, baby
Yeah, she looked good, like a lady
Do it to me, James
And the Mississippi River runs like molasses in the summertime
And me, you know, I don't hardly mind
Sippin' on a beer in Bourbon Street and I'm sittin' easy
Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to please me
Have a seat an' take a load off your feet, and she said "Yes"
So I said, "I like your dress"
Swamps all around make ya feel kinda funny, don't they, honey
She crossed her legs and looked at me funny
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin' (what you're doin')
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'
