Yeah
Take me back
I wanna go back, girl
Mmmmmhmmmmm
Hey

Summer loving, I remember falling
Once upon my history
Sun was shining, you were in a hurry
But nowhere that you had to be
Some conversation for a while
Until we felt the magic grow (Oohoohooh)
That's when my summer came alive
But seasons come and seasons go (Ooh ooh ooh)
Tender kisses underneath the moonlight
Softly on your brown skin (Yeah girl)
Making wishes, plans to spend our whole life
Knowing that this time would end
And like the temperature outside
Our feelings and emotions rose (Oohoohoohooh)
I dreamed I'd take you as my bride
But soon the autumn winds would blow (Ooh ooh ooh)
You might also like
My summer love (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'm searching for you (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Out time was only for a season
My heart remains true
I remember walking on the boardwalk
Beaming from just holding hands
We were running in between the rain drops
Innocence that couldn't last
I close my eyes when I'm alone
And travel back to way back then (Yes I do)
And like no other love I've known
You make me feel alive again (Heey eey eey)
My summer love, yeah (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'm searching for you (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh) (Searching for you girl)
Our time was only for a season
My heart remains true
My summer love (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'm lost without you (Yeah)
So many years have passed between us
I'm still your love, Oooh yeah

Take me away from this life
To places with you in my mind
Can we go back to the best time of my life?

My summer love, oh girl (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Girl I still love you (Yes I do) (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Our time was only for a season
My heart remains true
I'll be true just for you
My summer love
I'm lost without you (Oh I'm lost baby)
So many years have passed between us
I'm still that love, Ooooooh (Oooooh yeah)
 (Eric Benet)
Summer lovin', wish we could have made it last (Coulda made it last, girl) (Why didn't we?)
Summer love won't you please come back to me again (Come back, come back, Oh come back baby, yeah)
Summer lovin', wish we could have made it last (I'm lost without you, can't live without you, babe)
