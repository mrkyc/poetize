Ooooooooo, yea
Oooooo ohh
Ohhhhh wait
Two years since you walked away from me
Since all of our scattered dreams
Were just thrown away
I'm finally gettin back to what I used to be
Share my pain with my family
Think I'm on my way
I can sleep at night
I don't reach for you when I wake up (no)
But it's taken some time (yea)
I can live my life
Without praying that we could make up
I'm movin on, I'm feeling strong inside

But sometimes I cry, babe
When I'm all alone
With this heart of mine (oooo)
Sometimes I cry, babe
Although you've been gone
For a long, long time
(ohhhhhh yea)
You might also like
Heard you're moving in with someone new
I hope all your dreams come true
And you'll both be happy, yeah
Been long enough for me to take a look around
I've met a girl, we've been hangin out
She's been good for me
But when we're makin love
She don't take me there like you used to
And it hurts when I lie (when I lie baby)
Help me understand how to push you out
Forget you and let you go
Cuz Lord knows I've tried, yeah

But sometimes I cry, babe
Baby i been hurtin'
For a long, long time (yes, I have babe)
Sometimes I cry, babe
Ain't nothin workin
For this pain of mine

I'll just have to fake it
Until I can make it
There's a smile on my face, yeah
But I'm broken inside, yea
Sometimes I cry, babe
When I'm all alone, when I'm all alone
With this heart of mine
Sometimes i cry, babe
Although you been gone for a long long
A long long long
Long long long long long long time
Baby, baby, baby, i can't take it no more
I can't take it
(sometimes i cry)
Come back to me, baby baby please come back
(sometimes i cry)
Please come home and wipe the tears from my eyes (baby)
