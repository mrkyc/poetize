You just make me feel so good
(Feels good)
Oh, oh, oh

Now, now, now
Now, girl, I'd like to know
Exactly what the deal is
I don't like to lose control, no
But this is crazy what I'm feelin'
I know 'cause I keep tryna hide
How it feels when you're around me
I see your smile and I get high
I try to fight it, but
I can't see no reason why

'Cause you just make me feel good
(I feel good)
You give me little butterflies
(Oh, oh, oh)
You just make me feel good
(I feel good)
Not like them other boys
'Cause you don't even try
You might also like
I used to love my single life
You see it fits my disposition, mmm
But compared to what you put inside me
I'm second-guessin' what I'm missin', ooh-ooh, yeah
Now, baby, we can call it love
But let's not break it with a label, no (No, no)
Let's take it how it comes (Oh yeah)
I'll show you all my cards
And keep them face up on the table

You just make me feel good
(I feel good)
I tremble when I'm by your side
(Ooh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
You just make me feel good
(I feel good)
You're kind of crazy but
I can't get you off my mind

Now we've got time, let's take it slow
And where it leads, I don't know
Let's have some fun, keep it on the low
You know you got my time, that's for sure
(Give me some time, baby)
This thing is so strong (So strong)
Girl, you're blowin' my mind
You got that swagger, boy, I love your vibe (Yeah)
Feels so good, gotta play with your mind
(Feels good, feels good)
You just make me feel good
(I feel good)
You give me little butterflies (Whoa-ho)
(Oh, oh, oh)
You just make me feel good
(I feel good)
Not like them other boys (Hey)
'Cause you don't even try
You just make me feel good
(I feel good)
I tremble when I'm by your side
(Girl, you make me feel)
(Oh, oh, oh)
You just make me feel good
(I feel good)
You're kinda crazy but
Can't get you off my mind

(I can make you)
(You just make me feel good) (I feel good)
(Make you feel so good) (Feel good)
(Baby) (Feels good, yeah, yeah) (Oh, oh, oh)
(I can make you)
(You just make me feel good)
(I can make you feel so good)
(Make you feel so good, baby)
(You don't even try)
(I can make you)
(You just make me feel good) (I feel good)
(Make you feel so good, baby)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Oh, oh, oh)
(I can make you)
(You just make me feel good)
(Make you feel so good, baby)
(Can't get you off my mind)
(I can make you)
(You just make me feel good)
(I can make you feel so good)
