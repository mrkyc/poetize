Can I tell you, shall I count the ways
Can I find the words that could explain
How my heart, my life, my soul you changed forever
You ease my pain with such a gentle hand
And when I'm with you I'm a better man
And I'll never ever understand the way

That you sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
And when I look into your eyes
I hear a song that never dies
'Cause you sing to me

There's so much evil in the world today
Everybody's tryna make a way
Looking for a piece of love to make it better
But we can make it through and rise above
With your little serenade of love
And I know that we'll be strong enough to
Go on and on and on

'Cause you sing to me without music or words
Sweetest melody that I ve ever heard (Sweetest melody)
Sweet enough to make me cry
'Cause it keeps our love alive
Oh yeah, sing to me
(Oh, won't you sing, baby)
You might also like
And even through the fire
I know our love will find a way
And you're the reason why, girl
I'm singing stronger every day


You sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melodies that I've ever heard
'Cause when I look into your eyes
I hear a song that never dies
'Cause you sing to me, yeah
Oh, sing, baby
You sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody (Ooh, the sweetest melody)
That I've ever heard (Yes)
Sweet enough to make me cry (It makes me cry)
'Cause it keeps our love alive
When you sing to me (Sing, ah)
You sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melodies that I've ever heard
'Cause when I look into your eyes
(Oh, I look in your eyes, baby)
I hear the song that never dies
(I can feel how much you love me)
'Cause you sing to me
(Every time I look in your eyes, it's like I can hear)
You sing to me
La, la, la, la, la-da-da-di-da-di-da
Oh, sing to me
La, la, la, la, la-da-da. da
Please, baby, sing to me
(I love you so much, baby)
Sing to me
(I love you so much, baby, I love you, baby)
