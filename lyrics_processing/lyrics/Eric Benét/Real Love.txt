Oh, yeah, oh baby
Don't you know you we got a real, real love
Whoa-hoo

Precious, a word that comes to mind
When the morning come and you're asleep by my side
Cherish, a word that could describe
How our love has stood the many tests of time in our lives

There's a whirlwind of changes this life may bring (Yeah, baby)
But the real thing just holds off come what may
And we got something real, baby

Real love (Ooh), real love
In a world full of make believe
We got something real, girl
Real love (Ooh yeah), real love
I'll bet everything on you and me
(Everything, ooh)

I love you, not just for who you are
But for the way you made a better man out of me
(Yes, you did; yes, you did)
Now I try, I try, I swear, baby, every day I try (Try, yeah)
To live a life deserving of this joy you give to me, oh, to me
You might also like
Now you got your funny ways, girl
Lord knows I've got mine (Yeah)
Still we keep on getting better, better all the time (All the time)
'Cause we got something real, babe

Real love, real love
In a world where nothing's what it seems
(Nothing's what it seems)
We got something real, girl, real love, real love (Oh, oh)
Just standing strong for the whole word to see
(Whole world, baby)

Don't ever question what my heart needs tomorrow (No, girl)
Girl, I just want the same ol' love you gave me today
We've got it for sure
The kind of love that knows that joy brings some sorrow
But we can't go wrong if we just hold on
Ain't nothing stronger
'Cause we got something real, baby

Real love, real love
In a world full of make believe
(Oh, we got something real, baby)
Real love, real love (Yeah)
I'll bet everything, everything on you and me
Don't you know we got a real
Don't you know we got a real love for sure
Don't you know we got a real
Don't you know we got a real love for sure
Don't you know we got a real (Real love)
Don't you know we got a real love for sure (Real love)
Don't you know we got a real (Real love)
