And I love all women, if you know what I mean
Yes Lord, I love them dark, I love them light
Short, tall, thick, thin and back one more again, alright
But there's this one particular situation I need to tell you all about

I met a honey about a week ago
I got a little but I need some more
I ain't the only one to learn her curves
Matter of fact, forget what you heard
She's all, she's all that an more, oh yeah
Yes she is
Her repetition ain't squeak and clean
Our little gossip ain't phasing me
So go ahead say what you want
You can give a damn, but I don't
Cause I'm gone, I'm already gone
Yes I am
Don't you know she's
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah

A devil mind with an angel face, she'll leave and make an unbelievable
For a chance, just to get some ...
Yes you will
Uhh, you don't know what you do to me
What you killing the girls in my history
I need a shot just to let her hit
She gives me 2 when I need a fix
Lord knows I've tried, but I swear I can't quit
Don't you know she's mine
She's my, redbone girl
Redbone but she's my world
Have you see, my chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah

I like the long hair thick redbone
I do it so right, she say I'm dead wrong
And now she in love, like Faizon
Now I'm in my zone, I got her head spinning, spinning like a cyclone
And it's them red women at my red eye zone
I get at red.com
I'm high and my girl high yellow
Fine is wine, put it in a wine cellar
Roses are red, do you mind if I smell them
What can you do, Consuela, Consuela
I like them light skin, lighter than a feather
And if she red hot, I'm biting that pepper
Tighter than my leather pants, let them say
She the same color as my flag...
She's my, redbone girl
Redbone but she's my world
Have you see, my chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
