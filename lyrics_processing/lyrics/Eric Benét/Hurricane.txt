Standing here in disarray
A calm serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide
Gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun
Surrounded by everything I want
But nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdities
Losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need
To find that road
Right around that curve a lesson learned
Now that I have the eyes to see

A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

With poison toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treasure is
'Cause they only blocked my view
I'm spiraling down but so oblivious
Got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone?

A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane (A hurricane), a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again, yeah

Sometimes I cried (Sometimes I cried)
But tears wouldn't fall
And sometimes I tried (Sometimes I tried)
To break those walls and feel your love
But I came alive inside
When I finally found my way

Ooh, a hurricane (A hurricane), a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain, yeah
A hurricane (A hurricane), a hurricane
Sometimes the only thing that brings you back again, oh-oh-oh
Hurricane (A hurricane), a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain, yes
A hurricane (A hurricane), a hurricane, oh
