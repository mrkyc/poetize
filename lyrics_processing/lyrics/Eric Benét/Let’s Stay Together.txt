I never felt the wind so cold
Until I had to walk alone without you, girl
I never knew what it was to be a man
Well, let me show you, baby, 'cause now I understand
I never thought it'd hurt so bad, no, no, no
You never know 'til you lose what you had
I don't need to waste time runnin' around all over town, baby
Now I know where to find true lovin'
And I knew the first time that I ever seen you

Let's stay together
Girl, it would be so nice
If we just hold on and stay together
Everything will be alright
(We'll be alright)
Listen, baby

Tell me why it feels so strong
(Tell me, baby, tell me, baby)
The years roll by, but still this heart you own, girl
(Yes, you do)
I never felt a love so completely
Don't you know we're riding on destiny
And I knew the first time I ever seen you
You might also like
Let's stay together
(Can we stay, baby?)
Girl, it would be so nice
If we just hold on and stay together
Everything will be alright
(We'll be alright)

Ooh girl, you got me
'Cause when I wake up
You're the first thing on my mind
Tomorrow will be
So let's leave the past behind
Just let me lead you
To our happy ever after
And girl when we arrive
Why don't we stay awhile
(Stay, baby)

Let's stay together
(Can we stay, baby?)
Girl, it would be so nice
If we just hold on and stay together
Everything will be alright
Let's stay together
Girl, it would be so nice
If we just hold on and stay together
Everything will be alright
Let's stay together
Girl, it would be so nice
If we just hold on and stay together
Everything will be alright
(We'll be alright)
