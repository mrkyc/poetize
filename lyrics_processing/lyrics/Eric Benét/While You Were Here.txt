Through this veil of tears
I can see what was supposed to be
Now it's all so clear
Love from you was so real, so true, genuine
Stronger than time

Wipe your tears away
Kiss you every morning
Hear every word you had to say
Are all the things I should have done
While you were here

And now the foolish boy has grown
Into this man I'm sorry you've never known
Oh, I'm not afraid to love
'Cause every beat of my heart
Echoes all those memories from way back when
And the man I should have been

Wipe your tears away (Wipe your tears)
Kiss you every morning
Hear every word you had to say
(Hear every word you had to say, yeah)
Are all the things I should have done
While you were here (While you were here)
You might also like
Faded dreams of you and me
And of our little family are gone forever
My God in heaven (My God)
Before the gift of clarity
We pay the price of misery
Why, please tell me why

Her mommy's gone away
But in her eyes I see you more each day
How can I repay
All your love unreturned from so long ago?
Now I know

I'll wipe her tear away (I'll wipe her tears)
Kiss her every morning (Kiss her every morning)
Hear every word she has to say (I'll hear every word)
Do all the things that you would do (All the things)
If you were here
Brighten her rainy day (Brighten her rainy day)
Catch her when she's falling
(I would catch her whenever she's falling)
Say I love you each and every day (She'll know daddy loves her)
Do all the things that you would do (Do all the things)
If you were here (If you were here with us)
Wipe your tears away (I'm so, so sorry)
Kiss you every morning (Please forgive me)
Hear every word you had to say (Oh, every word)
Are all the things I should have done
