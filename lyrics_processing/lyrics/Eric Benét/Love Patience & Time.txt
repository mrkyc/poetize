I believe in the power inside of my heart
God is the source from whom we're never apart
No challenge too great and no cause is too small
This infinite love is inside of us all
Oh, whoa, yeah, tell you about

My buddy Greg lost his leg serving time in the desert
Sitting, drinking, thinking of things he couldn't do no more
Took a while for Greg to smile, but I heard he's doing better
He just won a marathon, second year in a row

Oh, there's a storm that you're gon' have to ride in your life
(Some time in your life)
Hope is the beacon that saves when you're lost in the night
Just hold on and you'll go in the light

Love, patience, and time (Love)
And it won't take long, and it's gon' be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
Love, patience, and time (Time)
That power is strong in your heart and mine

I knew a girl, a pretty girl, but her daddy never loved her
She wondered why every guy left her out in the cold
What Daddy did she must forgive, before her heart grows colder
And all the love she's dreaming of, maybe then she will know

Yeah, we got stories and people to blame for our lives
No, don't get lost in that circle
Don't you know that's a lie
The only way is to leave the past behind (Yeah-yeah)

Love, patience, and time
And it won't take long, and it's gon' be alright
(It's gonna be)
Love, patience, and time (Oh-ho)
That power is strong in your heart and mine
Love, patience, and time
And it won't take long 'til it's gon' be alright
(It's gonna be)
Love, patience, and time (Well)

There's so much more inside you and me
That the world leads us to believe (You will see)
Nothing's too great for this God in me
Keep in mind love and life
Everything is gonna be alright
Alright, yeah, yeah

Grab a gun, everyone, said the leader of many
We've got to kill to change the will of the other side
(Don't you believe)
Some people swear that blood and fear is gonna bring the world together
I believe that all we need is love, patience, and time

Love, patience, and time (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And it won't take long, and it's gon' be alright
(It's gonna be alright)
Love, patience, and time (Oh Lord)
