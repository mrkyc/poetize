Baby, what you searching for?
I'm pretty sure that you just don't know 'cause
You're looking with your body, not your head
You're brilliant and beautiful
But they don't see when they take you home 'cause

I can see it behind those eyes (Mhm)
Just waiting for the one who understands

Though I'm not like the rest (Oh no)

Jaded and blinded to a chance
(To take a chance with me)
