Oh
Ooh what you do to me
Yeah yeah, yeah

Quietly, your silhouette approaches me
A vision far too lovely to define, hey, yeah
Tenderly, you take complete control of me
The feminine seduction of body, soul and mind, yeah

Touch me, and I feel your femininity (Touch Me)
Girl, you're the lady women want to be (Yeah)
Softly, you move when you're making love to me
Love me every night with femininity (Femininity)

A child of innocence is how you look at me
But it's the woman's touch that makes it feel so right, so right
Your lips consume my deepest sensitivity
It feels so good, it makes me wanna cry (Make me cry)

Touch me, and I feel your femininity (Femininity)
Girl, you're the lady women want to be (Every women want to be)
Softly, you move when you're making love to me (Make Love To Me)
Love me every night with femininity (Femininity)
