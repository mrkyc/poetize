I've been away too long awhile
I lost my rhythm, I forgot my style
Too complicated for this simple man
But now I understand
Like a circle peg in a square hole
I tried to push it but it wouldn't go
It didn't kill me so my strength increased
And now I finally see

I found the love that was gone deep inside of me
I found the man who was lost and I set him free
I thought that the pain was never gonna end
But now I can be myself again

I had the best the world could offer for sure
But peace of mind is much more precious than gold
I was in a place where truth is hard to find
But it's all revealed in time
Stick out my chest and hold my head up high
Forgot how it felt to feel so good inside
A fool would gain the world just to lose himself
Now I wanna be true to no one else
You might also like
I gotta light in my eyes for the world to see
And thank God the music's back inside me
It was a long hard road to be better man
And now I can be myself again
I feel the roll of the thunder in my bones
I hold my head up high everywhere that I go
The gift of life I truly understand
'Cause I can be myself again

Now there ain't no wound love can't heal for sure
Yes, I know
And if you lose yourself, the Lord can guide you home
This I know

I found a joy and serenity
Won't let nobody tell me something's wrong with me
Got a big love inside, I'ma set it free
And be myself again, mmm

I found the love that was gone deep inside of me
I found the man who was lost and I set him free
I thought that the pain was never gonna end
But now I can be myself again
I feel the roll of the thunder in my bones
I hold my head up high everywhere that I go
The gift of life I truly understand
That I can be myself again
I, I, I said I can be myself again, yeah
I know I can be myself again, yeah
