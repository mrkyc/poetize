Maybe we need just a little more time
Time that can heal what's been on your mind
You can find what we've lost before it all slips away
We need time to mend from the mistakes I've made

God only knows what a heart can survive
So many tears from all the pain in your life
And where else could we go after all we've been through
I still believe my life is right here with you

So just hold on
And it won't take long
I hope that you can love me
When the pain is gone
I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart, oh-oh
Don't want us to fall through the cracks of your broken heart

I know it's taking a while, but every lesson I've learned
And if your heart speaks tonight, I'll hear every word
If you want to be free, I'll never stand in your way
But with all that I am, I'm asking you to stay
You might also like
Oh, hold on
And it won't take long
I hope that you can love me
When the pain is gone
I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart
I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart

There's a light that can burn
It exists in the heart
You can feel it when you know love is true
Ooh, if you could try to be strong
And keep the light burning long
It took a lifetime but I found it in you, oh, oh

Hold on
And it won't take long
I hope that you can love me
When the pain is gone
I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart
I don't want us to fall through the cracks of a broken heart
