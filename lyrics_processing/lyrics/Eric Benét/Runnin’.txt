All over town and just to see what I could find
Every now and then I find some company
But every kiss temporary
I try to tell myself that it was just a game
I'd run again to try and ease that lonely pain
No matter where I traveled, there I'd be
Stuck in those walls of skin called me
And I was just runnin' to find somethin' true
And I'd just be runnin' with nothin' to prove
And I kept on runnin' and nothin' to show
They all saw me runnin' and said "There he go"
You caught my eye one day when I was on run
Somehow you made me feel my life had just begun
I'd seen the last of all my roamin' days
Cause I knew from you, I'd never run away
Now you've got me runnin' to get home to you
And my heart keeps runnin' when I think of things you do
And I won't be runnin' to no one else no more
They all see me runnin' and say "That's love for sure," oh yeah
I'm not hesitatin', no, as soon as work is done, yeah
As fast as my legs can carry me, yeah
Mmh yeah, life ain't complicated, oh no
When you got only one, one heart, one joy, one place to be
You might also likeAnd now I'm watchin' people runnin' all around
Chasin' after things that'll just run them down
Life is so much better if they change their ways
I wish I could tell them but you know I can't stand
Cause I gotta get runnin' and get home to you
(Gotta get home, girl)
And my heart keeps runnin' when I think of things you do
(Think about the things you do)
And I won't be runnin' to no one else, no one no more
They all see me runnin' and say "That's love for sure"
And I'll just be runnin' to get home to you
And my heart keeps runnin' when I think of things you do
And I won't be runnin' to no one else, no more
They all see me runnin' and say "That's love for sure"
They all see me runnin' and say "That's love for sure"
They all see me runnin' and say "That's love for sure"
