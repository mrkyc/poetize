There was times when I was unsure that we
Were gonna last beyond the sunset, babe
But after years, it's clear we were meant to be
But something's been lost along the way
Remember times we just laughed for no reason at all
And all those feelings of anticipation
We've grown accustomed to life without living at all
Cause something went wrong along the way

Oh let me feel, I need to feel that sunshine
The light that used to glow upon my face
Oh let me feel, we need to find that sunshine
The way the love shining on yesterday

If you're willing, I'm ready to rediscover
All of the wonders that true love could bring
We've been asleep but have heard the wakeup call baby
Before we get lost along the way

Oh let me feel, I need to feel that sunshine
The light that used to glow upon my face
Oh let me feel, we need to find that sunshine
The way the love shining on yesterday
Oh let me feel, I need to feel that sunshine
The light that used to glow upon my face
Oh let me feel, we need to find that sunshine
The way the love shining on yesterday
You might also like
But minutes turned into hours, the hours turned into days
The days turned into years and years turned into empathy
And our shine, our beautiful shine, let's bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

Oh let me feel, I need to feel that sunshine
The light that used to glow upon my face
Oh let me feel, we need to find that sunshine
The way the love shining on yesterday
Oh let me feel, I need to feel that sunshine
The light that used to glow upon my face
Oh let me feel, we need to find that sunshine
