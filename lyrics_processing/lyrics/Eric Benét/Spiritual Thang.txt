Ooh girl, lover friend
From the day we first began
Felt a connection with you, ooh
Somehow can't explain
No one's makes me feel the same way you do
Your heart and mine are one
Somethin' deep is goin' on
It's like we've been here before, oh girl
Seems like God above
Had a reason to bring your love to me

I love what I'm feelin' (A spiritual thang)
You're giving to me, yeah (A spiritual thang)
I know it's for real (A spiritual thang)
The spiritual love you bring (It's a spiritual thang)

Love can't fade away (No)
When it's a spiritual thang (Oh no)
It's like we're one in the same, oh yeah
Girl, we've got a love that the whole world's been searching for
You and me, don't you know that?
