I've never been the kind for beggin' and pleadin'
But I can tell by your hazy smile
All of his lies you've been finding are heavy on your mind
He broke your heart and he took your pride
Will you ever love again?
Though you try you don't believe it
Come over here, talk to me a while
Girl if you tried you would find that
Someone like me, simple and free
I could change your mind
I'll love you in places he couldn't find
Girl don't you see for the chance I've been waiting
For you to let me
Love the hurt away (that's all I wanna do)
Love the hurt away
If you ever did, girl you need me now
You don't need the complications of running to a stranger
So I'm coming over and I'll stay a while
Taking my time till I find that sparkle in your smile
Like a father's shoulder or a mother's arms
Girl I've always been the one
For strength and understanding
The rain will stop the clouds will be gone
Girl if you tried you would find that
You're someone like me, simple and free
We're two of a kind
I'll love you in ways no one has ever tried
Girl don't you see for the chance I've been waiting
For you to let me

Love the hurt away (for so many
Years I been waiting for this night baby)
Love the hurt away, love the hurt away
I been there for you and you for me
Better friends we'll never find
Nobody really knows you (knows you, knows you)
No baby not the way I do (you know it's true oooh)
We could miss an opportunity for what we've both been trying to find
And girl it's time I told you (told you told you)
That all I ever really really wanted
All I ever really wanted was to hold you
