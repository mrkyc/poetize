You're still wanting me, you're still hungering
Now the first kiss was the one that let me see
Just how deep you're into me
Surprised by your intensity
I couldn't believe
Now the next kiss happened seven days ago
That's when I started letting go
Dropped my guard and let you know
I was ready for more, oh I
Oh, that's when I took you home
And I wasn't quite ready for how you came
Words can't explain pleasures
We've explored, oh I
Oh, we've been making love six nights strong
And I can't believe just how long you can go
I'm ready for more of the hunger in your soul, oh I
Girl, you're blazing like you never get enough of me
It's amazing that I'm loving that
You're still wanting me, you're still hungering
We keep rising like we're never gonna reach the top
I'm not trying to make you stop because
You're still wanting me, you're still hungering
You might also likeNow the first time was amazing like I said
Like nothing I've seen, done, or read
Colors and music played in my head
I wasn't prepared
Now the next time happened when I finally caught my breath
I saw the sweat drip off your chest
Girl, you inspire my very best
And I gave nothing less and it seems
With every conversation in between
I get a little more attracted
When you open up your mind, girl
I find your perception of the world coincides with mine
And I try to let the fever in me subside
But every time I see that little look in your eye
I come back to life
And I rise, I rise, I rise, oh
From the bedroom to the kitchen, up against the wall
Still I hear your body calling because
You're still wanting me and you're still hungering
From a hundred miles an hour back to slow motion
I'm the waves upon your ocean because
You're still wanting me and you're still hungering
Did you know that you smile when you're asleep?
Is it there all the time or only when you're with me?
When the morning sun shines on your face
Let me be the first breath you take, I wanna be
Girl, you're blazing like you never get enough of me
It's amazing that I'm loving that
You're still wanting me, you're still hungering
We keep rising like we're never gonna reach the top
I'm not trying to make you stop because
You're still wanting me, you're still hungering
From the bedroom to the kitchen, up against the wall
Still I hear your body calling because
You're still wanting me and you're still hungering
From a hundred miles an hour back to slow motion
I'm the waves upon your ocean because
You're still wanting me and you're still hungering
Girl, you're blazing like you never get enough of me
It's amazing that I'm loving that
You're still wanting me, you're still hungering
We keep rising like we're never gonna reach the top
I'm not trying to make you stop because
You're still wanting me, you're still hungering
From the bedroom to the kitchen, up against the wall
Still I hear your body calling because
You're still wanting me and you're still hungering
From a hundred miles an hour back to slow motion
