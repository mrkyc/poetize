I can't find my way, you're the one who helps me see
When the air is thin, I'm caving it, it's hard to breath
I just let you in so I can find that inner peace
In my darkest hour I run to you to ease my pain
I like laughter that keeps me from going insane
You fortify, lift me up so I'm feeling strong again
You're the reason why I'm still alive
You're just like music in my life
You take the wrong and make it right
You've saved my world so many times
You're just like music in my life
You're the perfect song, the perfect time, time and time again
I can lean on you, trust in you more than any friend
When I'm looking back at my life, you never left my side
I can count on you to tell the truth though it hurts sometimes
You inspire me, never lie to me, you're never one to judge
If we share a day, I walk away feeling showered with love
Even when I don't, you're holding on, you never let me go
Unconditional, spiritual
You're just like music in my life
You feel just like my guiding light
And I've been lost so many times
You're just like music in my life
You might also likeYou're just like music in my life

Like a perfect harmony, your love stays in tune with my heart
You're bringing out the best in me and nothing's gonna keep us apart
You're just like music in my life
You take the wrong and make it right (you made it right girl)
You've saved my world so many times (many, many, many times)
You're just like music in my life

I forget about my trouble, yeah
(I forget about my troubles) When I'm feeling down
(Forget about my troubles) When you came around
(I forget about my troubles) I just see your smile
(Forget about my troubles) When you stay a while
(I forget about my troubles) Just take my hand
(Forget about my troubles) And you understand
(I forget about my troubles) Everything is fine
(Forget about my troubles) When we spend some time
(I forget about my troubles) When I'm feeling down
(Forget about my troubles) Then you come around
(I forget about my troubles) I gotta see you smile
(Forget about my troubles) When you stay a while
(I forget about my troubles) I just take your hand
(Forget about my troubles) You know I understand
