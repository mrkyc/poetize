This world ain't nothing but crazy
I'm out here working trying to make it, yeah
Girl, it's so rough in this city
There ain't no resting for the weary
So baby, feel me, I need something to feel
So my spirit can heal, babe

I need you to wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
So when I come home tonight, you'll make everything alright
When you gon' wrap them chocolate legs 'round me?
The memory of my day will quickly just fade away
When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
Please baby, wrap them chocolate legs 'round me

Your cocoa skin against mine, babe (Yeah, babe)
Is all I need to help revive me
Just touch me and I feel pure, pure love
You're the only thing I'm ever sure of (Your love I'm sure of)
I need some reminding (Need some reminding)
That God is still, He's still behind me

So baby, come take my soul and set me free
When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
So when I come home tonight, you'll make everything alright
When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
I need you to understand and make me glad I'm a man
Deep inside you, that's where I need to be
Oh baby, just wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
You might also like
Hold on, hold on (Hold on)
I only need you to wrap 'round me
Hold on (Hold on), hold on
(Don't let go, baby, don't let go)
Don't you, don't you let go
I need some reminding (Need some reminding)
That God is still, He's still behind me

So baby, just take my soul and set me free
I want you to know how much you mean to me
When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
Oh, oh, tonight, I want you to make things right (Make it right)
Baby, come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
(Wrap 'em 'round, wrap 'em 'round, wrap 'em 'round)
I need you to understand and make me glad that I'm a man, babe
