Why get up?
How can I get up?
Why should I get up?
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever
Why get up?
Phone keeps ringing
Right off the hook
Some bill collector
I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed
And dream all day
The world outside
Bugs me anyway
When I get things going
The going gets rough
So I ask myself
Why get up?
Why get up?
Why get up?
How can I get up?
Why should I get up?
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever
Why get up?
Went to the doctor
He said lose some weight
If you don't do it quick
We'll have to operate
I talked to my lawyer
He said case is closed
That woman got it all
Even the garden hose
Staring at the ceiling
Thinking just my luck
I better roll back over
Why get up?
Why get up?
Why get up?
How can I get up?
Why should I get up?
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever
Why get up?
Well, I can't quit drinking
I'm nervous all the time
When I wake up
It's like a ton of lead on my mind
What was it, I said
To that girl last night?
She really got upset
I best stay out of sight
I remember a gun
Callin' somebody's bluff
I better duck under cover
Why get up?
Why get up?
Why get up?
How can I get up?
Why should I get up?
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever
Why get up?
Why get up?
Why get up?
How can I get up?
Why should I get up?
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever
