And the leaves came tumblin' down
I was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
And he was barkin' up at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw a seven
Billy swore, he threw an eight
Stagger Lee told Billy
"I can't let you get away with that
Well, you've won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat"
Stagger Lee ran home
Went and got him his 44
Said, "I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt that I owe"
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Said, "I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt that I owe"

Boy, he stood across the bar room doors
Said, "Now, nobody move"
And he pulled out his 44
Stagger Lee, cried Billy
"Oh, please don't you take my life
I got me three little children
And a very sickly wife"
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Got me three little children
And a very, very sickly wife
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee shot Billy
Boy, he shot that poor boy so bad
Then the bullet came through Billy
And went right through the bartenders glass
While I was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
And he was barkin' up at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark, go
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Well, he was barkin' up at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee, go Stagger Lee
Said, "I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt that I owe"
