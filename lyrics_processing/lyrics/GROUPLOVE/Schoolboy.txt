Ow!

I was just a schoolboy
I got no place to go
(Got no place to go)
Spent the afternoons alone on my kitchen floor
(On the kitchen floor)
Oh, mommy's late from work
She's stopping at the store
Whoa-oh, oh oh
Oh, this is how it goes

She was just a schoolgirl
She thought she met a dream
Or so it seems, so it seems
I spent some summer nights
Wrapped up in her backyard
Oh, I was so in love
And then I fell apart

Oh, when the room stood still
Oh, oh when the room stood still
You might also like
(Make me up, Make me up)
Or else I could tell you why
(Make me up, Make me up)
You're the reason I'm alive
(This is how you remember me now)
And just out the door is killing me
Oh, oh

And it was all so hazy
Running 'round this river town
The time we spent was here
And it can drive me crazy
Thinking 'bout that schoolboy
And how he disappeared

Oh, when the room stood still
Oh, when the room stood still

(Make me up, Make me up)
Oh, I wish I could tell you why
(Make me up, Make me up, oh)
You're the reason I'm alive
(This is how you remember me now)
And just out the door is killing me
And all my
Secrets wrapped around
This golden crown
And buried backwards
Behind my house
It's in the ground
And always wondered when
You'll come and dig it out
Oh no!

Make me up, Make me up, oh
Make me up, Make me up, oh
This is how you remember me
And something's always killin' me

(Make me up, make me up)
Oh, I wish I could tell you why
(Make me up, Make me up)
Last time in my life
(This is how you remember me now)
And something's always killin' me

Make me up, make me up
Make me up, Make me up
This is how you remember me (now!)
This is how you remember me (now!)
Not now
