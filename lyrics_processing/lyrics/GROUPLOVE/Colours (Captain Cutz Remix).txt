(I am a man, man, man, man)
I am a man, man, man, man
Up, up in the air
And I run around, round, round, round this down town and act like I don't care
So when you see me flying by the planet's moon
You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know I'm just like you

Huh (it's the colours you have)
Ha (it's the colours you have)
Huh (it's the colours you have)
Ha (no need to be sad)
Huh (it's the colours you have)
Ha (it's the colours you have)
Huh (it's the colours you have)
Ha

So I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head
And I see black, black, green, and brown, brown, brown and blue, yellow, violets, red
And suddenly a light appears inside my brain
And I think of my ways, I think of my days and know that I have changed

It's the colours you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad
It's the colours you have
No need to be sad
You've still got your hands
You might also like
So Mistress, Mistress have you been up to the roof?
He shot himself, self
There's blood on the wall
'Cause he couldn't face the truth
Oh, knock that down, leave the ground and find some space
And tell your friends, friends
You'll be back again, gain
Before it's too late

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad
(It's the colours you wear)
(It's the colours you wear)
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
You've still got your hands
(It's the colours you wear)
(It's the colours you wear)
So I am a man, man, man, man
Up, up in the air
And I float around, 'round, 'round this downtown
And know I shouldn't care
So when you see us there, there out in the open road
You don't need to explain
If everything's changed
Just know that you don't know

We call it... life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
We can't call it at all
We call it... life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
When you can't call it, woah
Yeah, We call it, woah
That's what we call it
Woah
