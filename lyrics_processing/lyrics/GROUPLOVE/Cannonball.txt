Cannonball
You're kicking on back when the zig-zag put you on the floor
But the Beach Boys bring that endless summer to your room
From the dive bar you can make it to that sold-out show
And you want that sacred love, won't you just make it so
But if things stop and lock down
Got to bend that ear near to the ground
And every time you get lost, get found
And when you raise up that glass, drink it down
Like hand-written mail we're just tales that are soon forgotten
Sink your teeth in the flesh of this new horizon
Had 'em screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
Being cannonball, bringing all hell to the board
Being cannonball
Cannonball
Got me screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
I'm a cannonball, bringing all hell to the floor
Through the rooftop, through that gridlock, through the alleyways
If the world's your canvas, just pick up that brush and paint
If you're caught between a rock and me and watch you wait
Better find another route, don't even fucking hate
You might also likeI'll follow ya
As if you were my lover
Yeah even if the dance is lost
And we're all going under
Like hand-written mail we're just tales that are soon forgotten
Sink your teeth in the flesh of this new horizon
Had 'em screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
Be a cannonball, bringing all hell to the board
Be cannonball
Cannonball
Got me screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
I'm a cannonball, bringing all hell to the floor
Cannonball
Oh coming down
You know you got me
Bringing all hell to the board
Cannonball
Bringing all hell to the board
Cannonball
Bringing all hell to the board
Bringing all hell to the board
Got me screaming out "Oh, my Lord"
I'm a cannonball, bringing all hell to the floor
