Why don't cha fill me up?
All these reasons too hard to explain
So I'll drink you up my dear
We got it all right here
Here is now and now is where I wanna be
Allora si (sha-la-la, sha-la-la) you belong to me, yeah!
Do-do-do-do-do, eh-he-he
Do-do-do-do-do, eh-he-he
Do-do-do-do-do, eh-he-he

Do-do-do-do-do, eh-he-he
And I had to get away from this here masquerade
Comes a time when a man loses his mind
It's such a mystery, my my philosophy
What to do when we do have some time?
Allora si (sha-la-la, sha-la-la) you belong to me (sha-la-la, sha-la-la)
Allora so (sha-la-la, sha-la-la), never let you go, no I'll never let you go!
