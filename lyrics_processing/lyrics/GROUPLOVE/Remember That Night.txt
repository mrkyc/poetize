You remember that night when I hit a red light
And you pulled up next to me?
We were two young cats feeling under attack
Just making out in the street

It felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go

Yeah, you always took so right with your jeans all tight
Like you're walking in a magazine
Will you hold my hand, say you are my man
And you only have eyes for me?

Yeah, it felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory
You might also like
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go go go go

I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are
I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are

You remember that night when I hit a red light
And you pulled up next to me?
We were two young cats feeling under attack
Just making out in the street

Yeah, it felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go, let me go
Let me go

I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are
I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are

Remember that night, yeah
Remember that night, oh
Remember that night, yeah
Remember that night, oh

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
