Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people
And that's just how I'll leave it
Yeah, I met somebody in a sea of people
And that's just what I believe in

Yeah, we laughin' like a Wednesday night
We ran across the interstate
And drank a bottle of vinegar
And then we stayed up really late

Break it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be
Bring it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be

And I am what I am, a natural disaster
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
And maybe I'll come back for ya'
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinny-dippin'
And I can't understand what I'm after

So as we lay upon this ground, I swear you look like Lucifer
But green is blue, and so are you
And now we gone to Jupiter (Right now)
To Jupiter (Ah, shit)
You might also like
Break it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be
Bring it down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be

And I am what I am, a natural disaster
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
And maybe I'll come back for ya'
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinny-dippin'
And I can't understand what I'm after

Swim, swim, swim in a swimming pool
The sky is blue, the trees are too
Swim, swim, swim from green to red
Go to bed, ya' sleepyhead
Swim, swim, swim in your swimming pool
Like swimmers do, I'll call on you

Yeah, I met somebody in a sea of people
And that's just how I'll leave it
Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people
And that's just what I believe in
That's just what I believe in
That's just what I believe in
And I am what I am, a natural disaster
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
And maybe I'll come back for ya'
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinny-dippin'
And I can't understand what I'm after
