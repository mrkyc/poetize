I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
You've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
You've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone

And it's the only thing worth knowing
It's the only thing worth knowing

And Hollywood just talks the talk
Making movies 'round the clock
But I've got something classical
To keep the people wanting more

So tell me that you want me
I'm more than just a memory
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you want me

I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
You've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
You've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone
You might also like
And it's the only thing worth knowing
It's the only thing worth knowing
It's the only thing worth knowing
It's the only thing worth knowing

And Hollywood just talks the talk
Making movies 'round the clock
But I've got something classical
To keep the people wanting more

So tell me that you want me
I'm more than just a memory
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you want me

I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
(And it's the only thing worth knowing)
You've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone
(It's the only thing worth knowing)
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
(It's the only thing worth knowing)
You've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone, you've been gone
