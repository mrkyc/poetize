I didn't ask for that
You give me heart attack
I didn't want to care
And then I saw you there
Been working like a dog
I turned all my dreams off
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name

I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

Even when I can't see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I'm working like I'm times two
Living in the back of a boat just like we do
Even when I dream all day

Don't wanna sleep tonight
You've got me feeling right
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name
You might also like
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

Even when I can't see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I work it like I'm times two
Living in the back of the bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day, even when I dream all day

Oh I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh

Even if I smoke in the backroom
Even when I go where to meet you
Even if I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I'm working like I'm times two
Waiting for the day just to end so I see you
