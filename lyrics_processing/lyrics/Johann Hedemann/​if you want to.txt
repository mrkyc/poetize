It was like so good how we used to be
Kiss you up in the elevator
Small talk till the night is gone
I never told you you're the only one that I want

We kept our love low key
None of us ever said a thing
Till you left right 'cross the sea
The sea came pouring out of my eyes

But tonight girl, I'm gonna make it up to you
Yeah alright girl, we can start this over new

It started with a quick date you were in a rush
Never knew that I would fall in love
Fast forward, you're staring at me
'Cause tonight you're the dream I see

We kept our love low key
None of us ever said a thing
Till you left right 'cross the sea
The sea came pouring out of my eyes
You might also like
And tonight girl, I'm gonna make it up to you
Yeah alright girl, we can start this over new
If you want to

Oh woah, woah
Take you by the ocean, take you to the river
Oh woah, woah
Take you where you wanna go, anywhere you wanna go
Oh woah, woah
Take you by the ocean, take you to the river
Oh woah, woah
Take you where you wanna go, anywhere you wanna go

Let your name drift through my heart
Hard to sleep when I can't turn the lights off
Gotta know I would swim the world (Swim the world)
Just to see you for another second

But tonight girl, I'm gonna make it up to you
Yeah alright girl, we can start this over new
And tonight girl, I'm gonna make it up to you
Yeah alright girl, we can start this over new
If you want to
Oh woah, woah
Take you by the ocean, take you to the river
(If you want to)
Oh woah, woah
Take you where you wanna go, anywhere you wanna go
(If you want to)
Oh woah, woah
Take you by the ocean, take you to the river
(If you want to)
Oh woah, woah
Take you where you wanna go, anywhere you wanna go
(If you want to)

Oh woah, woah
Take you by the ocean, take you to the river
Oh woah, woah
Take you where you wanna go, anywhere you wanna go
Oh woah, woah
