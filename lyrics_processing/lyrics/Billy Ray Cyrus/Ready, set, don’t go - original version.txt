She's gotta do what she's gotta do
And I've gotta like it or not
She's got dreams too big for this town
And she needs to give 'em a shot
Whatever they are
Looks like I'm all ready to leave
Nothing left to pack
There ain't no room for me in that car
Even if she asked me to tag along
God I gotta be strong
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life
As ready as I've ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win
She's waitin' on my blessings before she hits that
Open road
Baby get ready
Oh I'm ready
Get set
Don't go
Looks like things are fallen into place
Feels like they're fallen apart
I painted this big ol' smile on my face
To hide my broken heart
If only she knew
This is where you don't say what you want so bad to say
This is where I want to but I won't get in the way
Of her and her dreams
And spreadin' her wings
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life
As ready as I've ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win
She's waitin' on my blessings before she hits that
Open road
Baby get ready
Get set
Don't go
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life
It'll be alright
As ready as I ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win
I'll be OK
She's waitin' on my blessings before she hits that
Open road
Baby get ready
Get set
Please don't go
Don't go
Let me go now right now
I'll be alright, I'll be OK
Know that I'll be thinking of you each and everyday
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
