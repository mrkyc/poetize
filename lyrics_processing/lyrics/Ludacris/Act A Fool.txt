Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, man
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, ahh!

You just came home from doin a bid
Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!

Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor!
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon' split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around me!
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout "What kinda shit's he on?"
You disappear like "Poof, bitch be gone!"
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break!
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plates
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain in the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?!
See Ludacris LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
If you 'bout to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!

Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With my pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday, so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see they reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And for the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'Cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them girls up the block still runnin' they mouth
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon' do? Act a fool!

I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the street still smokin'
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
On the off-ramp, doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with a barbeque pit
And now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire, 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees in Vs that's fantastic
So girls, hold ya weave while I'm weavin' through traffic
I kick to fifth gear and tear the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens!
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Man, that ain't sticky, that's sticks and stems!
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
If the bottle's all gone and your eyes are red
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
