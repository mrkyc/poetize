Oh, no, the fight's out
I'm 'bout to punch your lights out
Get the fuck back, guard your grill
There's something wrong, we can't stay still
I've been drinking and busting too
And I been thinking of busting you
Upside your motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in (Aw, girl), they'll be more dead
Causin' confusion, disturbin' the peace
It's not an illusion, we runnin' the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? (No, nigga)
I'm doing a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck out of my way
I'm DUI, hardly ever caught sober
And you about to get ran the fuck over

Here I come, here I go, uh-oh, don't jump, bitch, move
You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd? Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down, I fuck the crowd up, that's what I do
Young and successful, a sex symbol, now bitches want me to fuck 'em, true, true
Hold up, wait up, shorty, oh, oh, what's up? Getting my dick sucked, what are you doing?
Besides minding my fuckin' business, trying to get my paper, child support suing
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fucking TVs and the jewelry? Bitch, tell me that
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'ma tell you like this, bitch, you better not walk in front of my tour bus

Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way

Get out the way, bitch, get out the way (Get 'em)
Move, bitch, get out the way

2-0, I'm on the right track
Beef, got the right mack
Hit the trunk, grab the pump, punk, I'll be right back
We buying bars out, showing scars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Call up Tit, grab the pills 'cause we poppin' tonight
Beat the shit outta security for stoppin' the fight
I got a fifth of the Remy, fuck that Belve' and Cris'
I'm selling shit up in the club like I work in that bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas
We on the dance floor, throwing 'bows, beating up niggas
I'm from the Dec', try to disrespect DTP
And watch the bottles start flying from the VIP
Fuck this rap shit, we clap, bitch, two in your body
Grab your four, start a fight, dog, ruin the party
So move, bitch, get out the way, ho
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0, so

Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
Move, bitch, get out the way
Get out the way, bitch, get out the way
