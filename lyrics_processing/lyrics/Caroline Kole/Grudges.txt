Hey baby
I'd like to see you outrun me
Tell your friends to draw a line
And let your clique 
But you're just like me
I'm your past
The before and ever aftermath (ah)
You can say that you're above me
But there's nobody that lucky
There's no goin' back

Letting it go is too easy
Grudges are more fun
Believe me

Watch me take it out on everybody else
Nobody's that innocent, I might as well
Call it a mission that I set in motion myself (oh-oh)
Divvying up every card that I've been dealt
Generous philanthropist, I'll share the wealth (share the wealth)
If karma won't do it, then guess I'll see to it myself
You're welcome
You might also like
Strangers on the street
Every  on me
Like the guy I met last week
Hell, I let it extend to my extended family

They say that it's draining to be anything but happy
But what's really crazy's when they get away with it
I'm not having it

Watch me take it out on everybody else
Nobody's that innocent, I might as well
Call it a mission that I set in motion myself
Divvying up every card that I've been dealt (I've been dealt)
Generous philanthropist, I'll share the wealth (yeah)
If karma won't do it, then guess I'll see to it myself

Oh, oh
'til Hell's looking frozen and Heaven is too
I'll climb the horizon and turn the moon blue
When you're back with roses to tell me the truth
I believe it when I see it
Or 'til I hear from you
Watch me take it out on everybody else
Nobody's that innocent, I might as well
Call it a mission that I set in motion myself (oh-oh)
Divvying up every card that I've been dealt
Generous philanthropist, I'll share the wealth
If karma won't do it, then guess I'll see to it myself

Ooh-woah, oh-woah
Woah, woah woah
