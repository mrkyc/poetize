There's a lust we can't control
Slowly undress, chest to chest
And unless I say goodnight
I know we're only gonna go too far
Please, I'm not quite ready for that next level
One kiss and that spells trouble (Trouble)

But you could talk me in, talk me into it
If you wanted to
You could talk me in, talk me into it
If you only knew
Yeah I'm likin', I'm likin' the way you do-o-o (Do-o-o)
What you do-o-o to me
I, I don't wanna lose control
Control, control, control
But then again I
I think I wanna lose control
Control, control, control
Ain't nothing wrong with a little bit of...
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Tro-uble, trouble, trouble, trouble
You and me that equals...
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Tro-uble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Ain't nothing wrong with a little bit of
I get down, I surprise you
Don't you push me
Let me in your crib today
Next day I'll snatch the goods away
You're not listenin', watch me now
'Cause I'm a good girl but I could be bad
You're not quite there, you're not on my level
Trust me, for you I 'm trouble
You might also like(Chorus)
This is a warning, I'm warnin' ya
You're taking too long, (Too) too long
Tryin' play look back and be cool
But boy you're playin' it wrong
Playin' it wrong
Now it's in your eyes, (Eyes)
You're really-really (Really-really)
Lookin' (Lookin') like you wanna do somethin'
Like-like you wanna do somethin' (Do somethin')
Boy you better get right (Get right)
If you don't (If you don't)
You're gonna mess around and lose somethin'
You're mess around and lose somethin' (Lose somethin')
I, I don't wanna lose control
Control, control, control
But then again I
I think I wanna lose control
Control, control
Ain't nothing wrong with a little bit of...
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Tro-uble, trouble, trouble, trouble
You and me that equals...
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Tro-uble, trouble, trouble, trouble
