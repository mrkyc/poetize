Yeah, here's another one
Uh, yeah, come on
, Frankie J, woo
Here's another one, yeah
Feel this right here
Come on, come on, come on, come on

It feels like only yesterday that you were lying here with me
I still hear you say, "Oh yeah"
I love the way you say, "Oh yeah"
But now it's just a memory
Now I'm knowing that it was my fault
By thinking I could brush it off
You always with me, saying, "Oh yeah"
So what? It's 5AM "Oh yeah"
I'm checking in when I check in

Baby, I was thinking, I'm so slick
When I know I've done you wrong
But you never know what you've got
Til what you got is gone

Got to try and make it through
Without you (Oh yeah)
And there's nothing I can do
Come on home, baby
Got to try and make it through
Without you (Oh-oh, oh yeah)
And there's nothing I can do
Come on, come on, come on, yeah
Yeah, hey

I remember coming home that night
Knowing something wasn't right
I was saying, "Oh yeah"
I'm sure that all her things are packed (Oh yeah)
And it's just too late to get her back
Didn't even have to read the note
Just to know that your heart was broke
I was thinking (Oh yeah)
You had more than you can stand (Oh yeah)
I should have been a better man

Baby, I was thinking (Yeah, yeah), I'm so slick
Girl, I was doing you so wrong
But you never know what you got
'Til what you got is gone

Got to try and make it through
Without you (I don't know what else to do)
And there's nothing I can do
There's nothing I could do
Got to try and make it through
(I'm gonna try to make it through) Without you (Yeah)
And there's nothing I could do
Come on, come on, come on, baby
I'm so sorry for the things I've done
I should have put you number one
But I've been playing myself
'Cause I know that you're all I want
But if you give me one more chance (Give me a chance)
I'll break it down for you, lady
No more playing around
Baby, I wanna be there for you (Come on, come on, come on)
Gonna make it through

Got to try and make it through
Without you (Oh oh oh)
And there's nothing I can do (I'm so sorry that i hurt you bad)
Got to try and make it through
(I don't know what else to do) Without you
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
And there's nothing i can do
Baby, please forgive me
Got to try and make it through (Baby, please forgive me)
Without you (Forgive me, yeah)
And there's nothing I can do (Oh yeah)
Gotta try to make it through (You know that I'm guilty, baby)
Without you
And there's nothing I can do (And I'm so sorry, baby)
Oh, yeah
