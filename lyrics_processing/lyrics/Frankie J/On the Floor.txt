It's all eyes on the player when I enter the club
I'm tryna to find a little mama for some part time love
And you just the right type, just the right size
I'm diggin' your demeanor with your deep brown eyes
You turn me on like a light switch
I'm just tryna groove a little good without stepping on my white kicks
I really like the way you look in them pants
SO come follow me to the floor and let's dance
Tell 'em, J

What's a dime like you holdin' up the wall for? (Wall for)
You should be dancin'
You should be dancin'
All the guys in the spot better yet
Nobody had the nerve to talk to you (Talk to you)
So let me talk to you

You lookin' good from your head
Down to your shoes, girl
What's your name and who you with
And do you got a name?
I can't believe that you came in by yourself, girl
But if it's up to me, I'd guarantee that you won't leave here alone
