Obsession...
Well, it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin' 'bout you, baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossing, turning in my bed
Well, it's five o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weep
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do, I think I'm in love, baby
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)
What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (is this an illusion)
That I have in my heart?

Could this be love
Or it could be an obsession
Little tings you do drive this man so mad
O puede ser amor
Puede que sea una ilusion
Lo que siento por ti no tiene explicacion
Yo, It's just past 12 o'clock, me only thinking 'bout yuh
Nena me a need yuh inna me side right now
Lo poquito que me ha hecho me tiene bien loco
The only thing me want es tenerte a mi lado
Tell yuh little man he done, tell him go go
Him a waste too much time and he nuh satisfy yuh
No te va a dar nunca lo que quiere, pa' eso estoy yo
Baby gyal sin along, this is your song
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)
What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (is this an illusion)
That I have in my heart?
Ooh, I love the way you freaky like that
Ooh, I love the way you freaky like that
Ooh, I love the way you freaky like that
It's an obsession (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Now, I know you're not my lady
But I'm just trying to make this right
I don't know what to do, I'm going out of my mind
So baby, if you let me kick it with you, then, well, maybe
We could ride together, we could do this all night
Now, I don't care if you got a man (uh-uh)
Baby, I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right (uh-uh)
Quite like I can
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)
What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (is this an illusion)
That I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)
What am I doing wrong?
(What am I doing so wrong?)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (is this an illusion)
That I have in my heart?
Amor...
