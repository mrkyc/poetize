Damn
I miss you
Mmm
Ooh

I toss and turn
It's so hard for me to sleep
I guess I'm no used to bein' alone, yeah
And I know it's because of me
And I'm tryna face this reality
Past relations, they've made me into this man that I am
Knowing now that it's wrong
It's too late 'cause she's gone

Gone, gone, gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me, honestly
Bein' strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it, she's gone, gone

This house is cold
It's like doing time in the pen
Wondering where she is and who she with, yeah
But the hardest thing is there's no one else to blame but me
So I guess I'll have to take it like a man
But I don't know if I'll ever love again
Yeah, yeah

'Cause this pain I'm feeling inside is like a hollow point through my heart
I know that it's kinda crazy, but I feel like I'm fallin' apart
Usually I'm so cool, but I lost it when she walked away
Lost without her, and she's gone

Gone, gone, gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me (All of me)
Gone, gone, gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me, honestly (Honestly)
Bein' strong to carry on ain't easy (It ain't easy)
Gotta face it, she's gone, gone
Without some kind of intervention
I can't go on another day (Oh)
And I can't even bare to mention
The very sound of your name
Without the sky turnin' into clouds (Turnin' into clouds)
Without the rain falling down (Falling down)
Falling down, again, again
I can't face the fact, she's gone

Gone, gone, gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
(She's gone) Gone, gone, gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me, honestly (No, no)
Bein' strong to carry on ain't easy (It ain't easy)
(Ain't easy) Gotta face it, she's gone, gone (She's gone)
Gone, gone, gone
Don't think she's ever coming back again
No
I shoulda never turned my back on my baby
Gone, gone, gone (No, no, no)
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me, honestly
(She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me)
Bein' strong (No) to carry on ain't easy (Ain't easy)
Gone, gone, gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
