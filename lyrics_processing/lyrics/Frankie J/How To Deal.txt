No, ooh

Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesn't wanna do
Do I live my life with you as my wife
Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream?
I gotta do this for me
'Cause if I don't, I'll probably regret it
But if I do, I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it?
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it, though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live
How do I deal without you?

So I have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime without you?

How do you deal when you can't be with
The one you love, but the one you love is with somebody else
(I don't know, I don't know, oh)
What do you do when you know she don't love him
But she loves me, but she can't stand lovin' you far away?
(I guess I'm gonna have to just)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't wanna have to live with it)
You just deal with it, deal with it (No, no, no)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else lovin' you)
