Girl, you've been kicking it with me constantly, for a while
You just can't wait to hear those three little words
Come from my mouth, yeah

I just can't tell you
Or find the words for
The way I feel about ya
I just can't be without ya
I wanna say it so bad, but something keeps telling me no
Contemplating, still debating
Should I just let it go?

I just can't say it's love
But you already know what's up
I really can't put it in words
Baby, you got to feel me
And I hope you can hear me
It's only you I'm thinkin' of (Yeah yeah)
But still, I just can't say it's love
