I'm never gonna let you down

I know we goin' through a lot of thangs
But then I'm really keepin' you tight
'Cause in the true light, girl, I wanna do right
I could leave this game 'cause, baby, I ain't trippin on the meaningless fame, hey
Never let none test, one flesh
Take it step by step 'til death
And we can get back up and we can ball if we should fall (If we should fall)
It's truly a blessin', come directly from Heaven
Through death and a resurrection
I'ma be right there by your side
Never let you down never need to cry
Wipe your eye, eye, eye
Wipe your eye, eye, eye
Wipe your eye, eye, eye
Wipe your eye, eye, eye

Girl, I know that you've been hurt
I'm here to make this work
I'm not the type to put you down
Just put your trust in me
And, girl, don't be afraid to try
I see you're tired of lies
I know you heard this all before
Just put your trust in me
