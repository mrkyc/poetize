Lately I've been worryin'
You out there huggin' the block
And I'm here alone again
You know I'll do what it takes to hold you down
But all this lyin' to myself is startin' to stress me out

I can't complain
I know you're trying to make life better
For us (I can't complain)
But things gotta change
'Cause this ain't gonna last forever
And I can't take it 'cause I miss you so much

You say you want me to have the world
And I believe it
But if that means you're not here with me
Then I don't need it (oh no, no, no)

Now I'm not ready to trade in all my Kelly bags
And I'm not saying you should rush
And take the Bentley back
'Cause I've grown so accustom to our lifestyle
But I'll trade it all to have you around
You might also like
I can't complain
I know you're trying to make life better
For us
But things gotta change
'Cause this ain't gonna last forever
And I can't take it 'cause I miss you so much

You say you want me to have the world
And I believe it
(I believe that you wanna give the world to me)
But if that means you're not here with me
Then I don't need it
(I don't need, I don't need it)

I know I never say it
But I do appreciate the things you do
(I appreciate everything)
The only thing that matters is I'd rather just be with you
(You know I'd rather be with you)
All I need is you
So you don't have to give me the world

You say you want me to have the world
And I believe it
(You know that I believe that you, yeah)
But if that means you're not here with me
Then I don't need it
(Said I don't really need it if you're not here with me)
You say you want me to have the world
And I believe it
But if that means you're not here with me
Then I don't need it
But it don't mean a thing if you're not here with me, yeah
