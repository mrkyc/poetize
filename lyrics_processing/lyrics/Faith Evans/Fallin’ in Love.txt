Oh, oh...

Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you

Sometimes I think about you
And I remember all the things we went through
And I realize that I need you
I've fallen so in love with you, oh

Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you

Oh, it's funny how things change
Not long ago, I thought my love for you would fade away
Your love gets sweeter every day
So in love with you, I want to stay, so baby
You might also like
Promise that you'll stay
Never take your love away
'Cause I need your love
You're stuck in my heart
Don't you know
And the feeling is strong
And I can't let you go
(I can't let you go)

Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you

Promise that you'll stay
Never take your love away
(Don't take your love away from me)
'Cause I need your love
You're stuck in my heart
Don't you know
And the feeling is strong
And I can't let you go
(I can't let you go)
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you

I'm all that you want and more
I just want to close the door
And share my love, and share my love
I just want to be with you
Show you that my love is true
What you don't see, believe in me

Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again with you
Fallin' in love, fallin' in love again
