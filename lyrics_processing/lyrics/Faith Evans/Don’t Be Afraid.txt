Baby, don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love

Since we've been together, baby
It hasn't been too long
But I slowly feel myself
Falling love again, yeah
And I want to give you more of what I have inside
But if I open up to you
Baby, you've got to love me, too

Every time I think about the time we spend together, baby
Holding hands and making love
Long walks and morning talks
I can't believe you only thought
That we were friends
Boy, you can't pretend

Baby, don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love (baby, you can't be)
My baby, don't be afraid of
(I don't want you to be afraid)
Afraid of my love
You might also like
Take some time to listen, boy
It's not so hard to do
Why can't you understand
After all that we've been through
If you put away your pride
And search within yourself
I know you'll change your mind
'Cause I'll be with someone else

Baby, don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love (oh no)
My baby, don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love

Every time I think about the time we spend together, baby
Holding hands and making love
Long walks and morning talks
I can't believe you only thought
That we were friends
Boy, you can't pretend

If I didn't have you, baby
I don't know what I'd do
'Cause you make me happy and I'm
Giving you all of my love
(I never wanna be without you, baby)
I never want to be without you
I don't know what I'd do
'Cause you make me happy, so boy
Don't be afraid of my love
Baby, don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love (don't you be)
My baby, don't be afraid of
(You don't ever have to be afraid, yeah, no no)
Afraid of my love
('Cause I just wanna love you, baby)
Baby, don't be afraid of
(I just wanna hold you, baby)
(Don't have to be) Afraid of my love
My baby, don't be afraid of
Afraid of my love
