What's happenin', baby girl?
I see you checking out the way I move
I'm diggin' that, fa shiggadel
Mmm, chillin' with the homegirl Faith, yeah
Oh, serious? Talk to 'em

From the moment I laid my eyes upon you
I knew that I wanted to
Take a chance on something new
I remember how I felt on that day
When you took my breath away
Words could not explain

But I knew from the start
From the beat of my heart, it was true
I had to have you
I don't know if it's real, but I know how I feel about you
There's something 'bout the way you move

Something 'bout the way you move
Your style is crazy sexy, baby, I really like it
I've been holding back so long but this feeling's getting stronger
There's something 'bout the way you move
Something 'bout the way you move
Your style is crazy sexy, baby, I really like it
I've been holding back so long but this feeling's getting stronger
There's something 'bout the way you move
There's something 'bout the way, yeah
You might also like
When I see you I can't even lie, you always blow my mind
And I start to feel those butterflies
Like a little kid in a candy store, I want it more and more
It's just a matter of time before I make you mine

But I knew from the start
From the beat of my heart, it was true
I had to have you, baby
I don't know if it's real, but I know how I feel about you
There's something 'bout the way you move

Something 'bout the way you move
Your style is crazy sexy, baby, I really like it
I've been holding back so long but this feeling's getting stronger
There's something 'bout the way you move
Something 'bout the way you move
Your style is crazy sexy, baby, I really like it
I've been holding back so long but this feeling's getting stronger
There's something 'bout the way you move
I don't know just what it is

I move like I'm gliding, smooth like I'm riding
Get up, get out, get yours, now get mines in
Cake and making icing, connected like Verizon
Can you hear me now? Tell me, tell me how you like it
I'll stay with you if you stay with me
I got faith in you, you got faith in me?
We'll take flicks together, two steps together
Dancing, glancing, taking chances
I'm chilling like feeling like this is
The one that I'm gon' make my Mrs
We're high when we touch, and we're tough
We lie in the cut, I don't do much
Being with you, being with me
Seeing it through, faithfully
I'll wait for you if you wait for me
Gracefully, patiently
I get chills up and down my spine every time I see you
Every time I see you, you knock me off my feet
Boy, it's so hard to explain what it is but it got me on you
Every time I see you, you knock me off my feet

Something 'bout the way you move
Your style is crazy sexy, baby, I really like it
I've been holding back so long but this feeling's getting stronger
There's something 'bout the way you move

Oh, I like it
Something 'bout the way that you move
Something 'bout the way you move
