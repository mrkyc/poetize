Won't you come over and make love to me
'Cause I haven't seen you in a while
Really miss your smile, oh
Won't you come over and make love to me
Baby, I want ya

Every time we're together, I feel a special part of me
Drawing me closer, closer to you, baby
I can't explain, it's just a magic that we share
Something between us two

Won't you come over and make love to me
'Cause I haven't seen you in a while (no no)
Really miss your smile, oh
Won't you come over and make love to me
(make sweet love to me)
Baby, I want ya

Sitting here in my window, thinking of nothing but your face
Oh, baby, I try to remember how it used to be
When you used to love me, love me every day, oh baby
You might also like
I don't wanna fight ya,  I just want you to see
That you are the one, the only one that's for me
Baby, let me show ya, there's no greater love
Baby, I love you for the things you do
And I want you to come over

Won't you come over and make love to me
'Cause I haven't seen you in a while
Really miss your smile, oh
Won't you come over and make love to me
Baby, I want ya

(Oh, I don't wanna fight ya)
I don't wanna fight ya,  I just want you to see
That you are the one, the only one that's for me
Baby, let me show ya, there's no greater love
Baby, I love you for the things you do
And I want you to come over (come on over)

Won't you come over
Won't you come over
Baby, I just wanna make sweet love
Just wanna show you, you are the one
Won't you come over
Won't you come over
Baby, I just wanna make sweet love
Just wanna show you, you are the one
Won't you come over
Won't you come over
Baby, I just wanna make sweet love
Just wanna show you, you are the one
Won't you come over
Won't you come over
Baby, I just wanna make sweet love
Just wanna show you, you are the one
Won't you come over
Won't you come over
Baby, I just wanna make sweet love
Just wanna show you, you are the one
Won't you come over
Won't you come over
Baby, I just wanna make sweet love
