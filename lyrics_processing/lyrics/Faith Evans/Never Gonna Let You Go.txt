If I had one wish, boy
I'd wish you next to me
And it could be in summer, fall, or spring, boy
'Cause you make my heart sing
I wanna give my heart, my soul, my love to you, oh baby, yeah
'Cause every day I'm not with you, I'm missing you like crazy

I need for you to love me (Love me)
Hold me (Hold me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Down deep in my soul, I'll never let it go
'Cause the love we share; no one compares to you
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
'Cause I really love you so
Oh I, I'll never let you go
Oh, no...no no no no

If you must know the truth, boy, I'm nothing without you
It's funny how I know what people mean, boy
When it's too good to be true
Because you give me joy, good love, good times
Such happiness, oh yeah
And every day I thank the Lord for you
I feel so blessed
You might also like
I need for you to love me (Love me)
Hold me (Hold me)
Touch me
Down deep in my soul, never let it go
'Cause the love we share; no one compares to you
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
'Cause I really love you so
Oh, I love you so
I'll never let you go
Oh, no...no no no

If you only knew what you really do
Ain't ever have no one that does it quite like you do
You could spend half a lifetime trying to find one like you
That's why I am so glad I found you, baby
I wished upon a star and then it came true
Darlin'...

I need for you to love me (Love me)
Hold me (Hold me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Down deep in my soul, I'll never let it go
'Cause the love we share; no one compares to you
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
'Cause I really love you so
No I, I'll never let you go
No no, ooh...
