I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes, I didn't see all the things
I used to see, what's going on?
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases, no more, no more
(Never imagined...)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (so emotional)

I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were warm
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching
From the door so hurt, there you were
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases no more, no more
You might also like
Never imagined you would be
A faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional

You had your chance (had your chance)
But you threw it all away (yes, you did)
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness (unhappiness)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official, I'm emotional)
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
(no more baby, baby, please)
I'm emotional (you threw it all away)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official)
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
(just a faded picture, faded picture) (gotta leave you, baby)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (baby, could you hear me, oh)
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official, I'm emotional)
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (never imagined, oh)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional
Yes, I'm looking at the front door, baby, whoa
So, so, so very emotional
