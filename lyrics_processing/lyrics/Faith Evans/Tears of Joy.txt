When I think about it, baby (baby)
All I can do is shake my head
"Cause there ain't no explanation, (baby) no reason
Oh, you must be heaven-sent
With your crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy love (your crazy love)
Boy, you got me so messed up
So messed up

Now all I know is your love
I tear up when I think about you, boy
You've got me so emotional
But when I cry now, they're all tears of joy

You gotta, you gotta, you gotta understand, baby
I've been through so many things
My heart has seen the ups the downs the highs and the lows (baby)
And every pain life brings
But now I got your crazy, crazy, love (your crazy love)
And all I wanna do now is sing
(Ooh) ooh (ooh) ooh (ooh) ooh (ooh) ooh
I just wanna sing for you, baby

Now all I know is your love
I tear up when I think about you, boy
You've got me so emotional
But when I cry now, they're all tears of joy
You might also like
Said I'm crying now, but it's not like before
Baby these are tears of joy
They've been the same since you walked through my door
Baby, these are tears of joy
Now all I know is your love (Your love)

I tear-up when I think about you, boy
You've got me so, so emotional
But when I cry now, they're all tears of joy

Look how you got me crying
Every, every, every, every day
Every day and every night, baby, oh
I'm crying now, but it's not like before
Baby, these are tears of joy (These are tears of joy)
They've been the same since you walked through my door
Baby, these are tears of joy
I'm crying now, but it's not like before
