Wipe your tears away
You don't have to cry no more, no more
Wipe your tears away
You don't have to cry no more
Take my hand, follow me
I've got everything you need

Long ago, I had a dream
Someone would come and share the years ahead
So I waited and I prayed
That he didn't come too late
I didn't know, know your name
But I wanted him to say to me

Won't you wipe your tears away
You don't have to cry no more
(I don't have to cry) No more
(No) Wipe your tears away
You don't have (No more) to cry no more
Take my hand (I wanted him to say), follow me
I've got everything you need

Come to me so that I can be in love
(How I long to be in love)
I carried on in life alone
No one to hold, but I'm still strong
You might also like
Will I always be alone? (Tell me, will I?)
Trying to wait by the phone (Waiting by, by the phone)
Hoping one day soon (Baby, I'm hoping)
You're gonna find me
(That you'll take me by the hand) You'll take me by the hand
(And you'll wipe my tears away) And then you'll wipe my tears away

Wipe your tears away
You don't have to cry no more (No more), no more (No, baby)
Wipe your tears away
You don't have to cry no more
Take my hand, follow me (I don't wanna cry no more)
I've got everything you need

Will I always be alone? (Tell me, will I?)
Trying to wait by the phone (Waiting by, by the phone)
Hoping one day soon (Hoping that you)
You're gonna find me
(That you'll take me by my hand) You'll take me by the hand
(And you'll wipe my tears away) And then you'll wipe my tears away
(Away, away, away) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh) Ooh ooh (Ooh ooh ooh) Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Tears away (Ooh ooh ooh), tears away (Ooh ooh ooh) (Tears away)
Won't you wipe (Wipe them all) my tears away (All away)
Tears away (My tears away), tears away (Wipe them all away)
Won't you wipe (Wipe), my tears away (My tears away)
(Wipe) Come and wipe my tears away (My tears away)
Tears away (Wipe my tears away), tears away
Won't you wipe (I want you to wipe my tears) my tears away
(Waiting for you, baby) Tears away (Ooh ooh ooh ooh), tears away
Won't you wipe my tears away (Wipe my tears away)
Tears away, tears away (I had a dream long ago)
