I just can't help feeling the way I feel
Just let me show you this love is real
I just can't help feeling the way I feel
The things you do to me, boy, I love you

The time has come for me to show
Show that I care for you so
No one makes me feel the way you do
And I'll never let you go

I just can't help feeling the way I feel
Just let me show you this love is real
I just can't help feeling the way I feel
The things you do to me, boy, I love you

You know my love for you is strong
I loved you for too long
Now it's time for you to realize
That you'll always be in my heart

And I love the things you do for me (I love)
You give me so much joy (You know)
Boy, you know all I need is you
You mean the world to me (The world to me)
And it's plain to see that, boy, I love you
