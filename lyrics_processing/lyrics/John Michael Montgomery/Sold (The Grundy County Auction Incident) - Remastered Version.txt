Where I saw something I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution
But my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that
And I said, "Hey pretty lady! Won't you gimme a sign?
I'd give anything to make you mine, all mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call."
Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice
I'm sold to the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!
Well, the auctioneer was goin' 'bout a mile a minute
He was taking bids and callin' them out loud
And I guess I was really gettin' in it
'Cause I just shouted out above the crowd!
And I said, "Hey pretty lady! Won't you gimme a sign?
I'd give anything to make you mine, all mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call."
Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice
I'm sold to the lady in the long black dress
Well she won my heart, it was no contest
With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!
