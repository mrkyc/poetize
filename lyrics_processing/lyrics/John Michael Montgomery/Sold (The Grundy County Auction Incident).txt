Well, I went down to the Grundy County Auction
Where I saw something I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution
But my heart said go ahead an' make a bid on that

An' I said, "Hey, pretty lady, won't you gimme a sign?"
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your bidding an' be at your beck an' call
Yeah, I've never seen anyone looking so fine
Man, I gotta have her she's a one of a kind
I'm going once, going twice
I'm sold on the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
An' I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

Well the auctioneer was going 'bout a mile a minute
He was taking bids an' calling them out loud
An' I guess I was really getting in it
'Cos I just shouted out above the crowd

An' I said "Hey, pretty lady, won't you gimme a sign"
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your bidding an' be at your beck an' call
Yeah, I've never seen anyone looking so fine
Man, I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind
I'm going once, going twice
I'm sold on the lady in the long black dress
Well, she won my heart, it was no contest
With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well, I'm about to bid my heart goodbye

Yeah, we found love on the auction block
An' I hauled her heart away
Now we still love to laugh about the way we met that day

When I said "Hey, pretty lady, won't you gimme a sign?"
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your bidding an' be at your beck an' call
Yeah, I've never seen anyone looking so fine
Man, I gotta have her she's a one of a kind
