Swimming in December
Heading for the city lights
In nineteen seventy five
We share in each other
Nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon
Drips from your eyes
We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try
We lived an adventure
Love in the summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life
For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven
Got lost in your eyes
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
You might also likeI can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
Can you remember and humanize?
It was still where we'd energized
Lie in the sand and visualize
Like it's seventy five again
We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us
I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
