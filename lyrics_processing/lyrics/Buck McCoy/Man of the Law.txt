What do you got under that that's faster than the Internet
She travels like she's on the run doin' all of this for fun
I'm curious to see what kind of story she'll tell me
When my lights flash you better slow down
I'm the king of the highway the king of this town
Pull your butt over 'cause I know what I saw
I'm your hard workin' under loved life savin' man of the law
Man of the law
She'll love me or she'll have me that's pretty much a fact
Not here to please her anyway she'll have to deal with that
May end up as her best friend we'll have to wait and see she better not just blow me off or make a fool of me
- when my lights flash you better slow down I'm the king of the highway the king of this town
Pull your butt over 'cause I know what I saw
I'm your hard workin' under loved life savin' man of the law
Man of the law
Stop playin' hard to get I'm workin' up an awful sweat
Can't you hear me callin' you
I'm clockin' you at 102
My blood pressure's goin' up I'll get you soon with any luck
You better have a good excuse
I don't think I will ever turn you loose 'cause when my lights flash you better slow down
I'm your hard workin' under loved life savin' man of the law
Your man of the law
- Finally she appears to be turnin' it around
That really is a smart move
Cause I could take her down
As I get a little closer what is this I see
A ninety year-old little lady starin' back at me
When my lights flash I never slow down
Chase you all the way to the end of this town
Pull your butt over I know what I saw
I'm your hard workin' under loved life savin' man
When my lights flash
You better slow down
I'm the king of the highway
The king of this town
Pull your butt over 'cause I know what I saw
I'm your hard workin' under loved life savin' man of the law
