As the midnight moon was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw that look in your eye
Looking into mine
See what you want to see

Darling, don't say a word
Cause I've already heard
Your body's saying to mine
You've got a fast move
Slow groove
On your mind

You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush

You want a man with a
Slow hand

You want a man with a
Slow hand, slow hand, slow hand, slow hand
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow

You've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush

Shadow on the ground
With no-one around
The blanket of stars in your eyes
Here we drifting free
Like two lost leaves
On a crazy wind on the night
Darling, don't say a word
Cause I've already heard
Your body's saying to mine
You've got a fast move
Slow groove
On your mind
