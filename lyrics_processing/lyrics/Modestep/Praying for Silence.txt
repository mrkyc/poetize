The violence last time spread
As there was a firestorm of riots
Extraordinary reports of gangs
Of hundreds of up to mass use
Setting shots, survive and looting
Widespread looting
And in many cases
According to local residents *woman screaming*
The police were even too lazy
When they did arrive
*police sirens*
*riot crowd*
