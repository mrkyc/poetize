Slipping right through your fingers
Behind your back, moving right between us
Cause all you know is to take, take, take
And just for taking's sake, you know
The snake can't harm its charmer
It's spitting venom right over your shoulder
Cause it can't break, you break
What you made, you made
It's all the same, the same

Let's make this understood
I've heard that now you've been up to no good
Sneaking words around my neighborhood
Let's make you understand
I've heard that now you've been acting bad
But you slipped your way right out to that

You're just a snake
Slipping round behind my back
You're just a snake
You let me down, and I'm done with that
You might also like
You're just a snake
Slipping round behind my back
You're just a snake
You let me down, and I'm done with that
(Ah)

You're just a snake
Slipping round behind my back
You're just a snake
You let me down, and I'm done with that

It takes an open heart now to be fooled
I bet you never thought you had it in you
Cause all you know is to take, take, take
And just for taking's sake, you know
You see deceit is bad behavior
You shouldn't have one, unless you tame it
Just wrap this up, I'm well and truly done
I bet this'll bottled up again

Let's make this understood
I've heard that now you've been up to no good
Sneaking words around my neighborhood
Let's make you understand
I've heard that now you've been acting bad
But you slipped your way right out to that
You're just a snake
Slipping round behind my back
You're just a snake
You let me down, and I'm done with that

You're just a snake
Slipping round behind my back
You're just a snake
You let me down, and I'm done with that
(You're just a snake)

You're just a snake
Slipping round behind my back
You're just a snake
You let me down, and I'm done with that
