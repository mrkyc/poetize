Listen to the righteous only
When they start to move on slowly
Take down to believe this nonsense
When people start making real sense

Cause you, see the signs
Of the life, with actions so blind
And you, see the signs
But we fear, they'll take our lives

Do you feel alive?
Now tell me do you feel alive
Do you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Now tell me do you feel alive
Do you feel alive?

How can you feel so damn lonely?
So much that you just can't show me
Enough and believe in something
Sit down before your mind starts ticking
You might also like
Cause you, see the signs
Of the life, with actions so blind
And you, see the signs
But we fear, they'll take our lives

Do you feel alive?
Now tell me do you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Now tell me do you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?

All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by these rules by my side
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by this hatred and lies
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by these rules by my side
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped but I know that there's time

All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by these rules by my side
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by this hatred and lies
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by these rules by my side
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped but I know that there's time
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by these rules by my side
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by this hatred and lies
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped by these rules by my side
All my life I feel trapped by these rules
I feel trapped but I know that there's time
