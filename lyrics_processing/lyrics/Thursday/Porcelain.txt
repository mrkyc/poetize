City of blue tile
Figure in ceramics
Where we reach out
Grab for porcelain
But it's too fragile to hold
And it shatters in our hands
(In time)
Seasons will seal these shards
(Into)
Slits that denote your wrists

Death is the answer
To calculations composed
Of motions that are the same
Secret and different
A missing alphabet with a message for us

When people die (Die)
They take a piece of us with them (Die)
And holes in clouds are minutes passing (People die and die)
Rescind this line and sever all ties (Die, die)
The skyline unfolds into explanation (People die and die and they die)
You might also like
That sometimes words give up and
Silently walk off the edge of the page and here
The cry opens up
Reveal the word inside
The crack in the porcelain
The crack in the porcelain
The crack in the porcelain

The silent line of sky-lit eyes show
The silent line of sky-lit eyes show
The silent line of sky-lit eyes show
(Show me death, it's up there, shine more brightly than lives down here)
The silent line of sky-lit eyes show
(Show me death, it's up there, shine more brightly than lives down here)
The silent line of sky-lit eyes show
(Show me death, it's up there, shine more brightly than lives down here)
The silent line of sky-lit eyes show
(Show me death, it's up there, shine more brightly than lives down here)
The silent line
(Show me death, it's up there)

When people die (Die)
They take a piece of us with them (Die)
And holes in clouds are minutes passing (People die and die)
Rescind this line and sever all ties (Die, die)
The skyline unfolds into explanation (People die and die and they die)
Explanation (Die, die)
Explanation (Die)
