Don't even take a breath
The air is cut with cyanide
In honor of the new year
The press gives us cause to celebrate:
These air raid sirens
Flood barbed-wired skylines
By artificial night
As we sleep to burn the red
From our bloodless lives
Tonight we're all time bombs
On fault lines
Have we lost everything now?
Walking like each other's ghosts
Around these silent streets
The sedatives tell you everything is alright
Like calendars dying at new year's eve parties
As we kiss hard on the lips
And swear this year will be better than the last
Jet black, the ink that spells your name
Jet black, the blood that's in your veins
Jet black, We say, "how long can we take this chance not to celebrate?"
There's music playing
But we dance to the beat
Of our own black hearts
And draw diagrams
Of suicide on each other's wrists
Then trace them with razorblades
You might also likeFire to flames, strike match
Burn these words from our lips
As the dagger screams, "love is dead"
And it's a newspaper tragedy
Have we lost what we love?
Have we said everything?
Does it change everything?
Stare at the clock
Avoid at all costs
This emptiness

Have we lost everything now?
Walking like each other's ghosts
Around these silent streets
The sedatives tell you everything is alright
Like calendars dying at new year's eve parties
As we kiss hard on the lips
And swear this year will be better than the last
Have we lost everything now?
Walking like each other's ghosts
Around these silent streets
The sedatives tell you everything is alright
Like calendars dying at new year's eve parties
As we kiss hard on the lips
And swear that this year... this year...
Ten seconds left
Until midnight
Nine chances to drown ourselves
In black hair dye
Eight faces turned away
From shock
Seven windows and six of them are locked
Five stories falling
Forever and ever
Three cheers to the mirror
Now there are two of us
Can we have one last dance?
Jet black, the ink that spells your name
Jet black, the blood that's in your veins
Jet black, we say, "How long can we take this chance not to celebrate?"
Jet black, the ink that spells your name
Jet black, the blood that's in your veins
