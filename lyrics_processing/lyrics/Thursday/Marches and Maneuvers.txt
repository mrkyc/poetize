This is a war we live
And the sides are drawn, sides are drawn
And we're all wrapped up in the days
And they wear us out, wear us out
There is a storm at sea

If we fly a white flag under a black and blue sky, will the red sun rise?
(The taste of your kerosene lips burn me up)
If we fly a white flag under a black and blue sky, will the red sun rise?
(Rise, glare from your enemy sights make me go blind)

Blinds divide the sunlight into thin strips, the size of a blade
In this trench that we dig for ourselves
Fourscore and fade
Glare with the enemy, heat of the bodies in the bed, no retreat

This is our war, we live it
We're up in arms, up in arms
With our head pressed against the wall
And it's wearing thin, wearing thin
These are the screams we swallow

This is our war
Administer the pill (Keep fighting)
Before the cell divides (Keep marching)
We'll both go down like toy soldiers
This is our war
Threats and picket lines (Keep fighting)
Us forming around our beds (keep marching)
And the landmines in our chests will all go off in time
If we trip each other into this
Do you think we'll find a way out?
We've synthesized a compound to treat this conscience, it's:

One part loss, part no sleep
Part the gunshot we heard
One part the screams mistaken for laughter
One part everything after
One part love, one part stepping out of the driving rain
One part parting ways, in the cold apartment, don't look back
Just keep running down the stairs
Hear the footsteps
Can you hear voices in the traffic, communiques in the attic?
They say "after time, all this will heal"
We will rebuild and these broken arms will mend
(Mend)
Themselves (Selves)
In our (Our)
