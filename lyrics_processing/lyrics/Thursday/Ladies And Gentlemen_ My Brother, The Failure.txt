(No one sees him)
Or passed out on pills in a stranger's room
(She don't know him)
Don't tell his sweetheart he's not coming home
Ladies and gentlemen, this is my blood!
Yeah, my brother's eyes are the same color as mine
Nobody knows if I see it when he says
"Brother look at the shape I'm in, you've got to help me out"
Or when he says
"There's still time left to make amends
You're in my trust, you're in my blood
I just need a friend."
And, "I need fifty bucks to pay off some old debts
(You can spare it)"
Or, "Cover for me while I sort out some shit
(Just this one time)"
He lies
When he opens his mouth the truth never comes out
But I believe it all when my brother says
"Oh have you seen the shape I'm in
It's all because of you."
And he says, "Don't even try to make amends
You're in my thoughts, you're in my blood
Even in my dreams."
You might also likeHe sleeps through the night
Everything is alright
And his teeth are all white
And his face fits the type
Everything he says is true
His girlfriend, she loves him too
But his head starts to hurt and his tie isn't straight
He goes to work early and gets home so late
Lies down in his room
Go to bed she'll be home soon
But he wakes with a start and she isn't in bed
So he flies down the stairs past that guy from that band
Was he wearing her parfume?
It's all because of you when the mirror says
"Just look at the shape that you're in
I offer you no forgiveness, not even in my dreams"
And the mirror says
"It's far too late to make amends
You've got nowhere left to run."
When the mirror breaks I know which side you're on
I know which side you're on
I know which side you're on
(I know which side you're on)
He sleeps through the night
Everything is alright
And you're teeth are all white
And you're face fits the type
Everything,everything, everything
Everything you say is true
Nothing is real
Am I?
Am I?
