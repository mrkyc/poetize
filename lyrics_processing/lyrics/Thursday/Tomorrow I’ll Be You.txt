The speakers can barely move
This is not a test
Tune to the broadcast
Witness the jetlag
Look in the mirror
Adjust the V-hold
Shatter the lens
Pull out the shards
Choke on her words
Caught in your throat
How long can the wheels maintain a spin
At this velocity?
On every block
A reminder
You can't stop this intersection
At every turn
Dead forests of tenements rise
Like antennas
The miles are adding up
And the days are counting down
Cut the jet black from my hair
Before we're bathed in the dawn
You might also likeOn New Year's Day
I will change back to myself
In the flame
We burn like the paper hearts of
Dead presidents
We're too lost
To lose hope
Maybe the night seems so dark
Because the day
Is much too bright
For us to see that we are cured
We are cured
(Shatter the lens. pull out the shards)
We are cured
We are cured
(Choke on her words, caught in your throat)
That's the sound of music from another room
The piano player hangs from piano wire
But the player piano carries on
Sit back and tune to the broadcast
Witness the jet lag
Shatter the lens
Pull out the shards
Choke on her words
Caught in your throat
This is not a test
This is not a test
Shatter the lens
Pull out the shards
Choke on her words
Caught in your throat
As the language dissolves
And the sentence lifts
A slow alphabet of rain is whispering
"aabcttipacbdefg..."
Since I replaced the I in live with an O
I can't remember who you are
But tomorrow I'll be you
Just pick up the phone
I'm calling from your house
In your room
In your name
Lying in your bed
Following your dreams
I listen to your voice
Get caught in my throat
As I sing
"This is just a dream"
On New Year's Day
We will change back to ourselves
In the flame
We are cured
We are cured
