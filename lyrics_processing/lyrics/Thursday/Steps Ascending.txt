Steps ascend to a loaded gun
The scent of matches hangs in the air
A lit one flickers out in a heartbeat
We don't want to see this
Flash of light that's letting go
An empty bullet case
By the time it hits the ground

It's out of reach (let go, let go)
Out of reach (let go, let go)
Out of reach (let go, let go)
Out of reach (let go, let go)
(Out of reach)
The wolves are closing in
There's no room left to make amends, but
Do you remember when we'd fly that kite so high?
All the time we've wasted
Spent fighting
Will burn
In the fire of our regret
All the time we've wasted
Spent fighting
It's blood
And it's running down the stairs
You might also like
Freeze the frame
Between the gunshot and the hole it makes
A spinning bullet hangs in the middle
There's no way to stop it
It will surely hit the mark
You can try to understand
But I'm giving up
Giving up
Giving up
The synapse fires, it's right in time
I'm giving up (Giving up)
Giving up (Giving up)
Giving up
This should always stay

Out of reach (let go, let go)
Out of reach (let go, let go)
Out of reach (let go, let go)
Out of reach (let go, let go)
The wolves are closing in
There's no room left to make amends, but
Do you remember when we'd fly that kite so high?
All the time we've wasted
Spent fighting
Will burn
In the fire of our regret
All the time we've wasted
Spent fighting
It's blood
And it's running down the stairs
I ran down the stairs
And into the garden
Put both my hands into the soil
In the spring
You will bloom
Like her heart
Through the blouse
In the back of the ambulance
As it turned and it turned down the street (Out of reach)
One more turn, won't you come back to me? (Out of reach)
As it turned its red lights
You were turning into
Red roses
Red roses
Red roses
Red roses
