Every man falls down
Everyone needs grace
Your love is enough now
By your name we're saved
Look beyond our wrong
Saw just we  need
We are alive now
By your name we're free
Chorus:
You got up, so I can get up again
Now I'm up again with you
You got up so I could get up again
You got up so I could get up again
I'm up with you, you
I'm up with you
Verse 2:

By your name we're free (By your name we're free)
