Sin around me
Pain is in me
Stress is on me
But I gotta keep looking up
Tears are streaming
Heart is beating
Others leaving
But I gotta keep looking up
Some will trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hills and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move from...
The Hill... The Hill... Hill
Trouble has found me
Pressure is crowding
People doubting
But I gotta keep looking up
Ground is shaking
Walls are breaking
And my heart is racing
But I gotta keep looking
Some will trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hill and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move ...
Some may trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hill and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move
On the hill there's a cross
On the cross there is blood for me for me 
Thank you for your blood Jesus 
Thank you for your blood
For you washed away my sins
Nothing but the blood
Oh Precious 
Oh precious is that blood on the hill
On the hill there's a cross
On the cross there is blood for me...for me

He still has the power
Wonderful power
To heal our diseases
To cover our weakness
He still has the power
Wonderful power
To heal our diseases
To cover our weakness

Still has the power
Wonderful power
To heal our diseases
To cover our weakness

On the hill there's a cross on the cross there is blood for me 
The cross don't discriminate
The cross don't discriminate
The cross don't discriminate no..
There's blood for you
