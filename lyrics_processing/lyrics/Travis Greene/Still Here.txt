I was sinking, so deep in sin
Your grace and mercy, decided to take me in
And placed my feet on, a rock to stand
It's unbelievable I'm not the same man
That use to fuss
Dance at the clubs and cuss
Mixed up true love with lust
And got my flesh in some stuff
That should have taken me out
Now I can shout about
The fact that I'm still here
(Everybody say this)
Chorus:
I'm still here(repeat)
Through the rain I'm
Through the pain I'm
Through the tears I'm
In every fear
He promised to never leave me
Nor forsake me and if the devil could kill me
He would have done it by now

Verse:
Holding on
To His hands
Standing strong
Can't comprehend
Why He would love me and keep me
Stand above me and and treat me
As if I'm cool enough to be called his friend
And He still use me
Even though I know I don't deserve it
He still choose me
To perform His works
Although I'm not worth it
And like Peter I denied Him
More than I can count but God's love
Refused to fail me and He always bailed me out
Yeah
Chorus:
I'm still here(repeat)
No weapon formed against me
Can ever prosper
Cause I'm
More than a conqueror through
Christ yeah
Through the rain I'm
Through the pain I'm
Through the tears I'm
In every fear
He promised to never leave me
Nor forsake me and if the devil could kill me
He would have done it by now
Bridge:
Shots fired in the club parking lot
Hearts stop as innocent bodies drop yeah
That day I get pulled over by the cops
My cousins sweating bullets
With a pocket full of rocks
God kept me yeah
Never left me
And He's worthy of all the honor
And the glory
Chorus:
I'm still here(repeat)
Through the rain I'm
Through the pain I'm
Through the tears I'm
In every fear
He promised to never leave me
Nor forsake me and if the devil could kill me
