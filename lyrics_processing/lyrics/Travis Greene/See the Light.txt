I see the light coming
No matter what it is
Then I'll face it
Jesus, You're the light
Woah...
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Darkness seems to be all around me
Searching for what my eyes cannot see
Where to go next and who can I trust
No one but You, my hope is Jesus

And I can see the light
I can see the light coming
I can see the light
I can see the light, woah

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Darkness seems to be all around me
Searching for what my eyes cannot see
Where to go next and who can I trust
No one but You, my hope is Jesus

I can see the light
I can see the light coming
I can see the light

This won't last
Your word will come to pass
I can see the light, coming
It's coming

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

For God, You're light
You're light on us
Shine Your light, Jesus
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Shine Your light
Your light on us
Shine Your light, Jesus
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh

It's coming

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
