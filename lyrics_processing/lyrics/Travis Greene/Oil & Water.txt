Like oil from the jar
Water from the well
Out of Your heart, it won't stop
It's a never-ending love

I was empty
In need of grace
I was searching
In every wrong place
Desperate for love
Crying for help, uh
Out of nowhere You came running
Now I'm running out to tell

Like oil from the jar
Water from the well (Whoo!)
Out of Your heart, it won't stop
It's a never-ending love (Hey!)
Joy, grace flowing
Unending love
Joy (Hey), grace (I brought a witness), flowing

You left heaven
To walk beside men
Faced temptation (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Still You knew no sin
Tried and crucified
You took the nails and died (Preach)
Out of the tomb (Out the tomb)
You came running (You came running)
Now I'm running out to tell
You might also like
Like oil from the jar
Water from the well (Hey)
Out of Your heart, it won't stop
It's a never-ending love
And joy (Joy), grace (Grace) flowing (Flowing)
Unending love (I know)
Joy, grace (Grace) flowing (Oh)
Unending love
And joy (Joy), grace (Grace) flowing (Flowing)
() Unending love
Joy (Joy), grace flowing (Flowing)

Get the joy back
Hands up like this
Let's go
You keep pouring out like oil (Hey)
You keep flowing out like water (From the well)
You keep pouring out like oil (You keep pouring out)
(Never-ending, no) You keep flowing out like water (Yeah, You keep)
(Pouring) You keep pouring out like oil (You're the beautiful God, You keep, You keep)
You keep flowing out like water (Hey, that's it)

I remember, mm
When I needed help
Out of nowhere, You came running
Now I'm running out to tell
Like oil from the jar (Oil from the jar)
Water from the well (Water from the well)
(Out of Your) Out of Your heart, it won't stop
It's a never-ending love

You keep pouring out like oil
You keep flowing out like water
