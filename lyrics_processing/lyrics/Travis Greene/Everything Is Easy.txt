Then you can walk on air
If you're a living martyr
Then you surpassed all flesh
And if you can heal the blind
Then you can see forever
Tell the sun to shine
Control the waging weather
If you can take a little food
And feed a lot of men
And you can take a dying fool
And give him life again
If you can do all this
Then this world belongs to you
If you can still love me
There is nothing that you can't do
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
If you can build a mountain
It's big and it must move
If you form the world on something
You have nothing else to prove
Give dust to living soul
And paint the ground with plants
He'll bath us with a glory
Then disease don't stand a chance
If you can live on finite time
You may live the season
If you turn water to wine
Then hoper than meaning
If you can do all this
My life belongs to you
If you can still love me
There's nothing that you can't do
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Because you're God
You alone are the only God, You rule and reign
You are God
You alone are the Jesus, To you we sing
Halleluyah, everything is easy for you
Halleluyah, everything is easy for you
Just one thought
Just one touch
Just one look from you
And my troubles are over
Nothing is too hard for you
By your stripes I am healed
Through healing me is easy
And changing me is easy
