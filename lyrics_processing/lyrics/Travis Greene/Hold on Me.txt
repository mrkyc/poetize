Brother Travis would like to say something to somebody
(Ya gotta hold on me)
Let's give him a hand as he comes
Thank you

If I could have your attention
Don't mean to waste your time
I'd like to tell a little story (A story)
How I was lost and couldn't find my way (Tell ya story)
But then I met Jesus (But then I met Jesus)
And something started to change
I ain't proud of the past
I'm proud of the fact
That I'm not who I was now

I am different now, every part of me (The whole me)
Has been touched by freedom
Oh Jesus, Ya gotta hold on me
I fell but somehow You refused to leave (You refused to leave)
Now all my wrong forgiven (Alright)
Oh Jesus (One more witness) Ya gotta hold on me
Brother John, yes sir

Born in North Carolina
Outside the county lines
Yeah, I came up in the struggle (Came up in the struggle)
And on the streets I had to find my way
But that was just a chapter
No, it was not the end
I ain't proud of the past
But I'm proud of the fact
That I'm not who I was now

I am different now (Say I'm different now)
Every part of me (Every part of me)
Has been touched by freedom
(Oh Jesus) Oh Jesus, Ya gotta hold on me
I fell but somehow (I fell but somehow)
You refused to leave (No, no)
Now all my wrong forgiven (King Jesus)
Oh Jesus, Ya gotta hold on me

(Alright, let's go, let's go)
No matter what comes or goes
(One thing is) One thing is for sure (Is for sure)
You won't let me go
(You got a hold on me) You got a hold on me (You won't let me go)
And when I'm losing control
(My God, I know You're dependable) You're dependable (Dependable)
No, You won't let go (You won't let go) (Yes sir)
You got a hold on me
No matter what comes or goes (I say no matter)
(One thing) One thing is for sure ('Cause I made up my mind)
You won't let me go (You'll never let me go)
You got a hold on me
And when I'm losing control (Losing control) (I'm losing my mind)
You're dependable (Time after time)
(You won't let me go) No, You won't let go ( in my hands)
You got a hold on me
We want to thank Travis and John for stopping by the service this evening
We'll be serving plate dinners in the back
Come and get you some red Kool-Aid
Because you know you've been changed
Hallelujah
See,  feel real good right now (I feel right good)
Now I want to talk to you a little bit more (Come on and talk to us)
I'm not finished with you (Talk to 'em, let's go)

I used to fall asleep in Sunday school
Sang in the choir so I could sit right next to you, yeah
Puppy love, but now see I forget your name
'Cause after time, memories they fade away (They fade away)
But still the day I could never let it go
That Sunday morning when I met the Holy Ghost
On my mama, church boy, now I'll never be the same
Jesus paid it all and told me I could keep the change
Pull up (My God)
