And the colors that they bring
You're still here and we both know
You'll remain through sunshine and rain
Alone but not alone because you're still here
And the presence of your love is so near
Alone but not alone because I know you
And as long as I do, I'm not alone

People come and people go
And the colors that they bring
You're still here and we both know
You'll remain through sunshine and rain
Alone but not alone, you're still here
And the presence of your love is so near
Alone but not alone 'cause I know you
And as long as I do, I'm not alone, yeah, yeah
Promise made is a promise kept
And your word's as good as gold
(Word's as good as gold)
You have never, never left me yet
You'll stay with me as I grow old
You might also likeAlone but not alone because you're still here
And the visions of days gone by are so clear
Alone but not alone because I know you
And as long as I do, I'm not alone
Not alone, said I'm not alone, no
As long as I know you
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
As long as I do, I'm not alone
People come and people go
Said you're never gonna go
You'll remain sunshine and rain
Said, alone but not alone because you're still here
And the presence of your love is so near
Alone but not alone because I know you
And as long as I do, I'm not alone
I've seen the lightning flashing
And I've heard the thunder roll, oh my
I've felt sins breakers dashing
But I've never, never been left alone
Alone but not alone, you're still here
And the presence of your love is so near
Alone but not alone because I know you
And as long as I do, I'm not alone
Alone but not alone, you're still here
And the presence of your love is so near
Alone but not alone because I know you
And as long as I do, I'm not alone
Alone but not alone, you're still here
And the presence of your love is so near
Alone but not alone because I know you
And as long as I do, I'm not alone
Life's fierce winds are blowing
Temptations aren't keen
But there's a sweet peace in knowing, oh my
That I've never, never been left alone
