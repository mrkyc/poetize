Choices I have made, good and bad still a man
And so I wait to see how it lays
This bed of debts and promises I made
So who pays... If I don't pay
I'm a man in pain, looking back on the past
Lord may the good, Lord may the good out way the bad
Well either way I cannot stay
I know I'll have to leave it all behind someday
God on that day... I hope that I can look you in your face
Mmmmmm Ohhhhhh Oh
The plans I've made... So incomplete
Now it seems that our wills complete
But still I pray
As much as I know how
That we'll get real before the sun goes down
It's going down
It's going down
Lord help me keep from breaking all the rules
Give me one thing I can choose
Maybe something you can use
Cause I've only tried to live what I believed
Never looking to get off cheap
This is simply not my best me
You might also likeI am a man upstaged by choices that were made
Having no say I was so, I was so, I was so afraid
And so I pray for my children's sake
In time they'll find your mercy still remains
So they don't pay
So they don't pay
They won't pay
