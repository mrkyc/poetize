Talking 'bout peace and love y'all
Understand oh Lordy, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
All this time that we've been looking for answers
While the windows of heaven swing open wide to us
Yeah, yeah, been a while since it's been left up to you and me
And we just can't seem to agree y'all, I don't know why
Show me this river that was just too deep and wide for us
I'll give two reasons why this notion's simply not enough
If I could find some peace
(Peace and love)
To take the place of hate and war
(Hate and war)
All we need is peace
(Peace and love)
Just to take the place of hate and war, oh
(Hate and war)
Let me say it like this
Times been far spent, I've been wondering what you can do
Unaware but now ashamed of what I put you through
Oh my, my, my, my, my
You might also likeTook me awhile, all the smoke in my eyes
I couldn't see that the weight on your shoulder was because of me, oh
But if you let me, I'll be your bridge and you cross over to the other side
And should you need me, I'll be just above the water line
Oh, and I'll show you the peace and love
(Peace and love)
To take away the hate and war
(Hate and war)
I, I, I'll show you the peace
(Peace and love)
It will take away the hate
(Hate and war)
And all we need is faith
(Faith and hope)
We can help change the world y'all
(Change the world)
Oh, oh Lord
I'll be the bridge if you cross over to the other side
And should you need me, I'll be just above the water line
Show me that river just too deep and wide for us
Come on, everybody lift every voice and sing
Till earth and heaven ring
Ring with the harmony of liberty, yeah
Peace
(Peace and love)
Take the place of hate and war
(Hate and war)
Somebody need peace now
(Peace and love)
Take the place of hate
(Hate and war)
Peace and love
Hate and war
