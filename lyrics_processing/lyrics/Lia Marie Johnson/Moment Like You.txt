Tell me how
Tell me how we both got here
We can't stop now
Love is in the atmosphere
And I don't wanna lose you
It feels like I've waited forever
Don't know what I'm doing
But it's alright
Yeah it's alright

So please don't leave me here tonight
Lonely on the dance floor
Cause I've been waiting my whole life
For a moment like you
So please don't leave me here tonight
Lonely on the dance floor
Cause I've been waiting my whole life
For a moment like you


Take you off
I can't seem to take you off my mind
Your broken heart
Let me fix your broken heart... tonight
So if love's what you needed
Then love is what you're getting baby
I can't believe it
That I'm here with you
Yeah I'm here with you
