Say it ain't so
Enveloped in gold
Inside your soul
You get me high
Take me down slow
Too good to be true
Sinking into you
I drown in the waves of your eyes
They're so blue

Whisper in my mouth
I need you now
Such a sweet sound
My body lifts from the ground

My body lifts
With your sweet kiss
It's all that I miss
I miss, oh
You are the sun on me
I am the moon in you
When you shine on me
That's when I'll show you my hues
When we're aligned
That's when I am brand new
You might also like
Lies on your teeth
You'll never catch me
I can foresee
The plans in your head
A rehearsed scene
A lover's story
You made me believe
I live in the world in between reality

Whisper in my mouth
I need you now
Such a sweet sound
My body lifts from the ground

My body lifts
With your sweet kiss
It's all that I miss
I miss, oh
You are the sun on me
I am the moon in you
When you shine on me
That's when I'll show you my hues
When we're aligned
That's when I am brand new
My body lifts (My body lifts)
With your sweet kiss
It's all that I miss
I miss, oh
You are the sun on me
I am the moon in you
When you shine on me
That's when I'll show you my hues
When we're aligned
That's when I am brand new
My body lifts (You are the sun on me, I am the moon in you)
With your sweet kiss (When you shine on me, that's when I'll show you)
It's all that I miss (That's when I'll show you)
I miss, oh (That's when I'll show you)
You are the sun on me
I am the moon in you
When you shine on me
That's when I'll show you my hues
When we're aligned (That's when I'll show you my hues)
That's when I am brand new
My body lifts
With your sweet kiss (When you shine on me, that's when I'll show you)
It's all that I miss (When you shine on me, that's when I'll show you)
I miss, oh (When you shine on me, that's when I'll show you)
You are the sun on me
I am the moon in you
When you shine on me
That's when I show you my hues
When we're aligned (All that I miss)
That's when I am brand new

(I'll miss, oh)
(That's when I am brand new)
