Greetings, Keenan
Let's take a road trip

I know a place where the grass is turning yellow
Fun, furry wild
Pull on my nose and feeling mellow
Sipping with my buds
Wiped out on my coastal wagon (coastal)
But wait something's wrong
You know some dogs are really hurting (some dogs)

Their all over the world
But nothing comes close to a kiss on their nose
Once you party with dogs
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

San Diego Dogs, are so adorable
Dogs want help before they are all gone
This is your shot, I know we'll melt your heart away
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
San Diego Dogs they like to surf a lot
Feel the wind, a blow in our lungs
Get yourself, come down to local shelters
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I texted rollmies on my cell phone

Big Birdy Dog is hanging out with us

Their all over the world (the world)
But nothing comes close to a kiss on their nose
Once you party with dogs (once you party with dogs)
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Sure in, I'm in the fun
And the gromies here ain't got no home
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the dogs I love the most
I mean the crust, I mean like I'm the best
Cut back, beach break in the deck
My crew has rip
I'm in a the deck, darker on the lips
I'm okay, I love the waves
I fetch and play bro bliss is my way
Dog Beach, wiped out
Cut some boards what I'm talking about
Dog doors, back wash flags
No leisure, you can't hide
The farties, hearties, or parties, no farting
Just kidding I'm sorry
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
I got a new baby (Uh-huh)
And we're here to stay
'Cause we're representin' the doggy way (Oh-oh)
San Diego Dogs, are so adorable

This is your shot, I know we'll melt your heart away
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
