Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round

Step right up, step right up
Come one, come all
It's the ride of your life
It's the rise and the fall
Ain't nothing to fear but the fear in your mind
So go ahead and get in line

Let me tell you a story, one about a small town girl
Who brought home a glory and felt like she could rule the world
But where was she that night, when she was feeling all the  pain?
Until the sunrise, today is just another day

I don't see how
These ups and downs
Keep me on the ground

All these roller coasters in my mind whirl by
Lines around the block just for one ride
Round and round and round, like I'm used to
Round and round and round, I'mma ride you
Round and round and round
You might also like
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round

I give it some time see, we've all been there before
Trying to get off, a ride we can't ignore
So now this is her life, got more than she could bargain for
Riding on her mind, it made her want it more and more

I don't see how
These ups and downs
Keep me on the ground

All these roller coasters in my mind whirl by
Lines around the block just for one ride
Round and round and round, like I'm used to
Round and round and round, I'mma ride you
Round and round and round

Why don't you
Step right up, step right up, take a ride on this roller coaster?
Do you want a nightmare or a daydream? Either way I'll get you closer
Don't forget to throw your hand sup high and scream like you're supposed to
Hey, try to keep your cool, yes, try to keep your composure
That's just the way life goes up and goes down
Head in the clouds with your feet on the ground
Wade in that water, oh, I hope you don't drown
Spinning around and around and around
All these roller coasters in my mind whirl by
Lines around the block just for one ride
Round and round and round, like I'm used to
Round and round and round, oh...
All these roller coasters in my mind whirl by
Lines around the block just for one ride
Round and round and round, like I'm used to
Round and round and round, I'mma ride you
[Outro: Fantasia + Aloe Blacc
Tryna get off the roller coaster
Instead of going round and round and round
All these roller coasters in my mind
In my mind...all these roller coasters
Roller co-, roller co-, roller...
In my mind, in my mind, in my mind...
Round and round it goes
Oh somebody help me, somebody help me
Somebody help me, somebody help me
Somebody help me, somebody help me
Somebody help me, somebody help me
