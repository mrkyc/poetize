Ooh, this is me
This is who I am

I'm still tryin' to make it out
'Cause I'm still just another girl from the ghetto
There's so much in my life
I break down 'cause I'm so deep in the struggle
(There isn't sun in rain, there ain't joy in pain)
Thought I found my way out then I'm back again
From the streets to the stage of Hollywood
Back to the blessings and the love in the hood

I'm just a girl tryin' to make a way
It gets so hard but I'll be okay
(Be okay)
I don't really care what the people say
'Cause this is me
A mother, a daughter
(Daughter)
A sis to my brother
(Sis to my brother)
I'm every woman 'cause I gotta be
And God put me through it 'cause He knows, I can do it
'Cause this is, this is me, yeah

Southern girl with city dreams
Got a sack full of clothes and just a few dollars
Bustin' tables while I'm tryin' to sing
Hope, I hit it big so I can send for my daughter
(There isn't sun in rain, there ain't joy in pain)
Thought I found my way out then I'm back again
From the streets to the stage of Hollywood
Back to the blessings and the love in the hood

I'm just a girl tryin' to make a way
(Make a way)
It gets so hard but I'll be okay
I don't really care what the people say

A mother, a daughter
(Mother)
A sis to my brother
(Sis to my brother)
I'm every woman 'cause I gotta be
(Oh yeah)
And God put me through it 'cause He knows I can do it
(He knows I can do it)
'Cause this is, this is me, yeah
(Oh me)
No one really knows the whole truth
(The whole truth about me)
And no one's had to live in my life
(Then they would know it ain't easy)
Made my share of mistakes, that's alright
'Cause I'm not gonna be afraid no more
'Cause this is me and I won't hide who I am

I'm just a girl tryin' to make a way
It gets so hard but I'll be okay
(Oh yeah!)
I don't really care what the people say
