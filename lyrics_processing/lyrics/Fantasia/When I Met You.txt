When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things you'd see me through
When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things that we would do
Then I met you
When I met you
I met me too

Listen
Sometimes it takes baby mamas
To show you, you don't need the drama
And once you're high like marijuana
You won't wanna hit no other

Listen to me when I tell you
That without him, there would be no you
So yes, I thanked my ex
A little still (Oh, still)
'Cause without him, how would we know
Our love is really real

When I met you
I never knew
'Bout all the things you see me through
When I met you
I never knew
'Bout all the things that we would do
Then I met you
When I met you
I met me too
You might also like
Listen
Sometimes it takes fireplaces
To show you, you don't need to chase him
And sometimes it takes flowers and good wine
To show you, you don't need the late nights

Listen to me when I tell you
That without him, there would be no you
So yes, I thanked my ex
A little still
'Cause without him, how would we know
That our love is really real

When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things you'd see me through
When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things that we would do
Then I met you
When I met you
I met me too

I met me too
When I met you, baby, woah
When I met you
Met me too
When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things you'd see me through
When I met you
I never knew 'bout all the things that we would do
Then I met you
When I met you
I met me too

I met me too when I met you
I-I still remember the day
It was, it was beautiful, yeah
Um, If I hadn't went through the things I'd went before
Then I wouldn't know how special you are
Now, my eyes would still be closed
And, um, now, they're wide open
