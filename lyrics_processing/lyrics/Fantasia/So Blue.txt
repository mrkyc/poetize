I'm so blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
Crazy and gone over you, over you, over you, over yo-o-u, hey

If these walls could talk here's what they'll say
I haven't seen my man in about four days
He's been missing and lost since he found out
I done brought another man up in this house
But I swear it isn't my fault, no it's not
About a week ago I caught him, he ain't figured it out
And I can admit that two wrongs don't make it right
Cause since it happened I ain't lying, I can't sleep at night

If I could take it back, baby I would take it back
Cause see I want my man to stay
But then I see the facts and this is how I react
I wish I handled it another way

I'm so blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
Crazy and gone over you, over you, over you, over yo-o-u, hey
I'm so blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
Crazy and gone over you, over you, over you, over yo-o-u, hey
You might also like
If I could take back time I would take it back
To the time when you made my heart go boom clap clap
But like I said all good things, they must end
And now we're no longer lovers, not even friends
And if I could I swear I would, I swear I would
Make it good, ah, coulda, shoulda, would
I knew I could, I knew I would, probably should, so...

If I could take it back, baby I would take it back
Cause see I want my man to stay
But then I see the facts and this is how I react
I wish I handled it another way

I'm so blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
Crazy and gone over you, over you, over you, over yo-o-u, hey
I'm so blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
Crazy and gone over you, over you, over you, over yo-o-u, hey

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I am so, oh, I am so blue
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I am so, oh, I am so blu-u-u-u-u-u-ue
I'm so blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
Crazy and gone over you, over you, over you, over yo-o-u, hey
I'm so blue, so blue, so blue, so blue
Crazy and gone over you, over you, over you, over yo-o-u, hey
