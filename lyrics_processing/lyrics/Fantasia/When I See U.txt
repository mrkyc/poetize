(Mafia)

I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction
I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
What's happening to me?
In the dark, can you tell me what it means?

I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Is this the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you
You might also like
I scribble X's and O's in my notebook
Checking how my hair and my nails look
I feel myself in the zone
I get nervous when you call
So I say I'm not home
I see your face
When I hear my favorite song
Should I send a email at home
You're the number one topic on the phone
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue?

I lay my head on my pillow
You got me staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
What's the reason why?
Yeah

You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you
Something now is taking over me
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm not gonna run
I'm, just gonna stand here and see
Ooooo, yeah

You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you
You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
