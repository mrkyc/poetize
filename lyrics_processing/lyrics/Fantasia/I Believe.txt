Ooh
Ooh, mmm, mmm

Have you ever reached a rainbow's end
And did you find your pot of gold? Oh
Ever catch a shooting star?
And tell me, how high did you soar?

Ever felt like you were dreaming
Just to find that you're awake?
And the magic that surrounds you
Can lift you up and guide you on your way

I can see it in the stars across the sky
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see, I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally, I believe

When you look out in the distance
You see, it never was that far, oh no
Heaven knows your existence
And leads you to be everything you are, oh
You might also like
There's a time for every soul to fly
It's in the eyes of every child
It's the hope, the love that saves the world
And, oh, we should never let it go

I can see it in the stars across the sky (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see, I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I believe in the impossible
If I reach deep within my heart, yeah
Overcome any obstacle
Won't let this dream just fall apart
You see, I strive to be the very best
Shine my light for all to see
'Cause anything is possible
Oh, when you believe, yeah

I can see it in the stars across the sky (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
You see, I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally
I believe
Oh-oh, yeah
I believe, oh yeah, yeah
Love keeps lifting me higher (I believe in love)
Love keeps lifting me higher (Higher, higher, higher, higher)
Love keeps lifting me higher (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Love keeps lifting me higher (Love keeps lifting me, love keeps lifting me higher)
Love keeps lifting me higher (You oughta try it for yourself, lift me higher)
Love keeps lifting me higher (I believe, I believe, yeah)
Love keeps lifting me higher (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Love keeps lifting me higher (Higher, higher, higher, higher)
