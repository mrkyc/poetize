Every now and then, I still get a flashback
Of the time I spent thinking you could be that one
Should I have just kept your love?
Yes, I understand, we did have some good times
On the other hand, got me crying all night
It was too much for my mind

So even though I left you, I can't forget you
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
Guess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
When we were together, you ain't treat me right
Damn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet)

I still have the box full of things you gave me
Start to throw it out, something always stops me, yeah
I'm not as over you as I say
Deep inside my heart, I made the right decision
But it's kinda hard
When your mind is thinking of, did I make a big mistake?

So even though I left you, I can't forget you
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
Guess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
When we were together, you ain't treat me right
Damn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet)
You might also like
See, I don't understand
Like, somebody is gonna get hurt
Out of this situation and you just hope it's not you..
At times..
Part of me wants you, part of me don't, part of me is
Missing you, part of me is gone. Part of me is saying that
The love is still strong. Part of me is letting go

So even though I left you, I can't forget you
'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
Guess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
When we were together, you ain't treat me right
Damn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie
