The hours, they turn into seconds whenever I'm with you
And it feels like the minutes are running away from me, too
I could just live here in your arms, I don't wanna move
'Cause the way that you love me
It makes me feel like I'm brand new

You tell me that we can stay here forever
And me, I foolishly believed
'Cause nothing can last as long as we want, baby
But I just can't hide it, I want you to stay here with me

It's so hard to let you go
Baby, that's how I know it's real love
I fight, but my feelings show
They came rushing in just like a flood
I can't get enough 'cause I need you, baby, baby, by my side
You can give me your time
And I'll always ask for more
'Cause forever just ain't long enough

I'm drawn into you like a moth to a flame
And I'll risk it all for you, baby, no, I ain't got no shame, oh
Now if you give your everything, I promise, baby, I'll do the same
I'll keep on being the woman you need, I won't change (Oh no, no)
You might also like
Oh, you tell me that we can stay here forever
And me, I foolishly believed
'Cause nothing can last as long as we want, baby
But I just can't fight it, I want you to stay here with me

It's so hard to let you go (It's so hard)
Baby, that's how I know it's real love
I fight, but my feelings show (I try to fight it but my feelings show, yeah)
They came rushing in just like a flood
I can't get enough 'cause I need you, baby, baby, by my side (I need, I need you, need you now, need you now, baby)
Give me all of your time
And I'll always ask for more
'Cause forever just ain't long enough

Oh, we know all this love is more than I prayed for
More than I thought I would see in a lifetime
And it's getting stronger
Baby, just stay here with me

It's so hard to let you go (With me, with me, baby)
Baby, that's how I know it's real love (Real love, baby)
I fight, but my feelings show (Ah, yeah, my feelings show, baby)
They came rushing in just like a flood
I can't get enough 'cause I need you, baby, baby, by my side (I need you baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
You can give me all of your time
And I'll always ask for more (Ooh, yeah, baby)
