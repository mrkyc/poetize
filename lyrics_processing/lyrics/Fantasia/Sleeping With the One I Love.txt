I'm sleeping with the one I love
Said I'm sleeping with the one I love
Cause the one I'm with is good to me
He just ain't good enough, oh, oh, oh

I strive to do right but I'm doing so wrong
I'm living in this house but I can't call it home
He gives me what I want but it's not what I need
My mind is telling me to stay but my heart wants to leave

Said I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping with the one I love
Oh, because the one I'm with is good to me
But he just ain't good enough, oh

Yes, I've tried to shake it off, and I even tried to pray
But I'm still waking up in a bed that don't belong to me
See he offered me the Earth, but instead chose space
I found about the cost, but it's a price I'm willing to pay

That's why I'm sleeping, sleeping with the one I love
That's why I'm sleeping, I'm sleeping I'm sleeping
Sleeping with the one I love
Cause the one who's here with me, he's good to me
But he just ain't good enough
My love, my love, my love

See my baby's like a dream but the other man, he haunts me
One is here with me but the other's got me where he wants me
Yes I got a man, but I'm still feeling lonely
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Do, do, do

I'm sleeping, sleeping, oh, I'm sleeping with the one I love
Oh, because the one I'm with, he's good to me
But he ain't good enough, oh

I tell you that I'm sleeping with (with the one I love)
I tell you that I'm sleeping with the one I love
(With the one I love)
Every, every chance I get, I gotta have him, Lord
(with the one I love)
I don't mean to hurt nobody's feelings
But I'm... I'm telling you he's the one
(With the one I love)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sleeping
(With the one I love)
Anybody, anybody ever felt like this
(With the one I love)
I'm sleeping (with the one I love)
Yes, I'm sleeping, I'm sleeping with the one
(With the one I love)
Sleeping with the one
(With the one I love)
I tell you I'm sleeping
