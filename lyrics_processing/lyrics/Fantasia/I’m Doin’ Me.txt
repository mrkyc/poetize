You know
Sometimes you have to put yourself first
I'm doin' me

Sometimes as women, we give more than we should
To a man that just don't treat us good, no
Gave him my heart, my time, did all that I could
In the past to keep him here with me, yeah
But now I woke up, opened both my eyes up
Realized that I don't need any other
Man, if you can't love me equally
Then you don't need to be with me
Nothing more beautiful than knowing your worth
And finally, I know exactly what I deserve, oh

Doin' me this time around
Doin' me, don't need you now
I rather be by myself
I won't let your drama hold me down
Doin' me this time around
Doin' me 'cause I've finally found
I'd rather be by myself
I'm doin' me, yeah
You might also like
Won't spend another minute wasting my time
On a man, hey, that only tells me lies, no
Ain't saying no, no, no, no that I don't need love
But them games, I don't need that in my life, no
Doin' me this time around

I'm doin' me, don't need you now
I rather be by myself
I won't let your drama hold me down
Doin' me this time around
I'm doin' me cause I've finally found
I'd rather be by myself
I'm doin' me, yeah

And I could pray for you to act right everyday
But it ain't up to me to make you change, yeah
Life is too damn short to live unhappily
So I'm being selfish and putting myself in first place

Doin' me this time around
Doin' me, don't need you now
I rather be by myself
I won't let your drama hold me down
Doin' me this time around
Doin' me cause I've finally found
I'd rather be by myself
I'm doin' me, yeah
I'm doin' me this time around
Doing me, this time around
No more crying, going through hell
It's so good, I'm lovin' myself
I'm doin' me, this time around
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
Yeah, yeah, I'm doin' me
