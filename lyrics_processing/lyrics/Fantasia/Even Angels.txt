I'm driving in circles
Shoulda bought that new phone
I can't find my way to
All the places I call home, I'm (On my own)
I'm at the station pumping gas
Yeah, I'm taking out the trash, I'm (All alone)
And whose there
Whose there?

Since you been gone, I learned how to move on
How to be myself, I don't need nobody's help
I'm doing so good, I forgot that I could
Live like this, ohh

First step, take a deep breath
You don't need a reason why
You can, you can, take take time, you can, you can
Walk, run, dive, close call
Think you might fall, but all you gotta do is try
Even angels, even angels learn to fly

Coming home in this late night
Shoulda left the lights on (on)
I can't help but image all the things
That could go wrong, I'm (on my own)
I'm in the kitchen
On the chair, reaching for the top shelf, I'm (all alone)
And I'm okay, I'm alright

First step, take a deep breath
You don't need a reason why
You can, you can, take take time, you can, you can
Walk, run, dive, close call
Think you might fall, but all you gotta do is try
Even angels, even angels learn to fly

Everyday I'm stronger
It can't get better
If it if it Don't hurt
Why? Why? (Oh why?)
See me in my next life
Heartbreak's a teacher
And now, I love ah love ah
A little bit deeper
Why? Oh why? (oh why?)

First step, take a deep breath
You don't need a reason why
You can, you can, take take time, you can, you can
Walk, run, dive, close call
Think you might fall, but all you gotta do is try
Even angels, even angels learn to fly, fly, fly, fly
Close call
Think you might fall, but all you gotta do is try
