Everybody's likes "He's no item
Please don't like 'em
He don't wife 'em
He one nights 'em"
And I value my friends opinions, I don't wanna fight them
But I'm really feeling that's this one is the right one
You always on my mind when the night comes
So I leave a key under the door mat just incase you might come
Staring at my window
Picture on my wall
Phone on my pillow so I hear it if you call
If you saw how I be's when I see you
Baby, I even be blushing when I leave you
It's something 'bout my body being next to you
So sexy boy, you sexy, boy
You make me shy and might get nervous
If you know it I think you staring at my eyes on purpose
Wish on a sign hoping it to come true
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue

You don't believe when I tell you that I need you
I get this tingeling in my body when I see you
I get upset when I call and can't reach you
It ain't nothing I want to, to please you
To see you always smiling back
I ain't copy that benz or the diamond ring
We can take us a trip jus you and me
Get a pin house four week long (Miami beach)
Have fun hit the water on the jet skies
The leartard saying just sex me
Come show your boy love
Give a gangstar a hug
Clearly ain't nothin missing a thug
Oh, yes, I miss you
Got you a gift to
Open your legs baby girl, I wanna kiss you
Everything about you I adore
Your the first I want to see when I get off tour
You might also like
I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction
I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
What's happening to me?
Anybody can you tell me what it means?

I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Is this the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you

Ok, normally I won't do this but ah
Here goes nothing, let's get 'em
When I see you baby, look I see us
Remix for the radio so I can't curse (Haha)
We focus right now, baby, I can't talk
You know I got that new coop girl, I can't walk (Woo)
Truth is I'ma call you later
I'm on the grind right now trying to get this paper
I'm in this streets all day I'm just trying to eat
Your in the bed all night, you just trying to sleep
It ain't like em with that chick from the other side of town, yeah
It is what is, baby, wipe me down, yeah
Think back how it was with out me
And how everything is so thug about me said
You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you

Something now is taking over me
And I don't know how
But I gotta be on time when ever you come around
Ask me when I'm coming, I'm coming right now
I think 'bout you whenever I go to Mr. Charles
Got a pen and a napkin, writing our names down
My first name with your last name
I know we not married but I'm practicing
I'm not going to run, I'm having fun
And whatever you ready, tell me, I'ma have your son
With you in my presents, I'mma different individual
Things dragisually change and you are my visual
See I'm prepared or I'm so scared
Nothing compares to how much I care
Wish on a star for a sign hoping it come true
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue
I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Is this the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
