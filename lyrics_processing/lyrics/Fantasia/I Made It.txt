I done made it through the storm and the rain
So much pressure, heartache, so much pain
I've been broken into pieces, maybe more
On some nights I made my bed right on the floor
The enemy really tried to take me out
Hit me with his best shot, knocked me down
I'm still standing after all I've been through
I survived it all and it's because of you
 (Fantasia) {Tye Tribbett}
(Woah, oh oh)
I made it (I made it, yeah)
I made it (Oh yes I did, y'all)
I made it {Still standing}
I made it {Let me hear the horns, let's go}
{Horns}
{Everybody clap your hands and get up}
(Glad I made it)
{Here we go}
You might also like
I remember all those days I walked in shame
Only recognized by all of my mistakes
But once I thought I would straight walk out the door
Swear I thought my heart couldn't take no more
But you're the only one that really loved me
When everybody else just didn't care
You're the only one that never left me
It was you
You, you, you
 (Fantasia) {Tye Tribbett}
I made it (I made it, yeah)
I made it (Good God Almighty)
I made it {(Still standing)}
I made it
I made it (Yeah you made it)
I made it {By the grace of God}
(I made it) I made it
{Everybody say Oh}

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh {Everybody say Oh}
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh {Everybody say Oh}
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
{I just wanna say} Thank you Lord
(I gotta say thank you, I gotta say thank you Lord)
Thank you Lord
(Thank ya, thank ya Lord) Thank you Lord
(I would have never, never, never, never made it without you, Lord Jesus)
Thank you Lord
(I) {Just wanna say}
Thank you Lord
(Thank you Lord for loving me for me)
Thank you Lord
(Thank you Lord for keeping me)
{Thank you Lord}
( Lord Jesus, I made it, I made it, I made it)
{Thank you Lord}

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh {So grateful Jesus}
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh {Thank you, I say thank you}
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
