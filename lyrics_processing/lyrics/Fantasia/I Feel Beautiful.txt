Nothing I ever did was good enough for you
Nothing I ever did could ever seem to please you
You always tried to make me feel small
And all I did was give you my all
Never felt pretty enough
Never felt sexy enough
Never felt good enough
You tried to keep me down on my knees
I got myself back up on my feet
Found the strength to set myself free

And I feel beautiful, beautiful
I feel beautiful, beautiful
You could not crush my soul
Crush my soul
Nothing you can do to me
Could take away my right to feel
Beautiful, beautiful
I was down, so low, down so low
But I won't be
Won't be brought down anymore
I stand with my head held high
I feel beautiful
You might also like
Use to make me feel like I did nothing right
Use to make me feel like I meant nothing in your life
Always gave all i had to you
All I wanted was for you too
See me as pretty enough
See me as sexy enough
See me as good enough
But all I did was waste all my time
I woke up and open my eyes
Finally took back hold of my life

And now I feel beautiful, beautiful
I feel beautiful, beautiful
You could not crush my soul
Crush my soul
Nothing you can do to me
Could take away my right to feel
Beautiful, beautiful
I was down so low down so low
But I won't be
Won't be brought down anymore
I stand with my head held high
I feel beautiful
You tried to make me feel worthless
Now I know I'm not
My worth is priceless
I got back my pride
I took back my life

And I feel beautiful, beautiful
I feel beautiful, beautiful
You could not crush my soul
Crush my soul
Nothing you can do to me
Could take away my right to feel
Beautiful, beautiful
I was down so low down so low
But I won't be
Won't be brought down anymore
I stand with my head held high
I feel beautiful
I feel beautiful
Nothing you can say to me because I feel
