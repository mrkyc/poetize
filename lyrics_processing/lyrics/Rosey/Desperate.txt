So many things in this life, I'm just starting to understand
I look in the mirror, and I am talking back to you
And I know you have to get better, for me to do it too
No one will ever love me that way again
I swear I'll never be that desperate not again
Do you remember, the last night we were together
What you said, when you took my head and you held it on
The floor, maybe you were wasted, maybe I let you forget
Because I couldn't believe what you were doing to me
And I still don't believe it now...
I'm terrified of love, but I'm more scared of being left alone
And I know...
No one will ever love me that way again
I swear I'll never be that desperate not again
Don't treat the one you love like a criminal
And don't look for me, cause I'll be gone....
I had to find out, I have to do it all by myself
Cause the one I want to help me can't even get up
So get out, let me go now!!
You might also likeNo one will ever love me that way again
I swear I'll never be not that desperate again
No one will ever touch me that way again
I swear I'll never be not that desperate
No one, no one will love me, not like I know you did
But I swear I'll never be that desperate not again
How would you show me you're that one
One is the loneliest number and you know I'd love to love you
But I ain't the one you'll come home to or run to
I'll be on the road, gone before you know
All around the world, back again
Baby you understand, cause this is our time
Hold me love, hold me tight...
One, but so much more
One, cause I've been waiting so long for
One who'll bring out that heavy heart in me
One cause I am alone
Could you be, could you be the one, the one for me
