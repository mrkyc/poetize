To the far away lands with the blackened suns
From the smoke and narrow minds
The half-truth trails and the holy lies
Of an empty heart and overflowing mouth
A plastic smile and a coward's frown
Repercussions come around
When the word named free burns to the ground somehow
Where are the deaf and where are the dumb
From the side of the tracks where no reason comes from
And the table's never bare
The water runs and mama's always there
So who separates the world from the start
With such words and such words would cause
A shot heard round the world
A justice that never hurt at all

So down, down, down like a ball of flames
To the rotten core filling up with names
Of hypocrites, what a massive list
Don't exclude yourself from it
You might also likeDon't compromise administration lies
Carried out and covered up with time
Carried out and turned around to shine
We're high on a pedestal of broken lies
Compassion speaks loud for itself
Falls on broken ears and off the value shelf
Into the dirt left to the wind
Coming up strong, ready to begin
To obliterate the word from the start
With such ideas come and such ideas cause
A spark that will set a blaze
And leave the embers red until the end of days

So down, down, down like a ball of flames
To the rotten core filling up with names
Of hypocrites, what a massive list
Don't exclude ourselves from it
Don't compromise administration lies
Carried out and covered up with time
Carried out and turned around to shine
We're high on a pedestal of broken lies
Where are the ones who carry the guns
To the far away lands with the blackened suns
From the smoke and narrow minds
The half-truth trails and the holy lies
Of an empty heart and overflowing mouth
A plastic smile and a coward's frown
Repercussions come around
