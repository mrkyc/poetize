I spit when I'm down
I beat my head against the wall
Like the fool that I am
Catch one drop of a tear
In the palm of my hand
Pour the rest out in front
To the ground I couldn't stand on
On and on I declare
On and on I debate you
To cut my throat and bury me
In the ditch that I belong to
You showed me a sign
A glimmer of light
While some called it heaven
Oh but I called them eyes
Oh my lady, I never thought that I'd survive
When you hit bottom, man, it's hard enough to climb
Much less not lay down, much less stay awake
And hold your head high and see what's in your way
If you live
If you live
You might also likeBut I followed the trail
Let my instinct work
For a shot in the dark
We'll have time to flush a bird
And from one special dear's hand
In the palm of my own
You had to roll the dice and gamble now
To never be alone
On and on I declare
On and on I debate you
To mend this heart and pull me
From the ditch that I fell into
Yeah you showed me a sign
You were a beacon of light
While some called it heaven
I called it love at first sight
Oh my lady, I never thought that I'd survive
When you hit bottom, man, it's hard enough to climb
Much less not lay down, much less stay awake
And hold your head high on up and see what's in your way
If you live
If you live
You get what you give
If you live
What is it worth
To stay in the dirt
To beat your head against the wall
Like a fool that's been hurt
Oh what is it worth
To stand your ground proud
Dig your nails into that wall
Climb and scream loud!
Oh my lady, I never thought that I'd survive
When you hit bottom, man, it's hard enough to climb
Much less not lay down, much less stay awake
And hold your head high on up and see what's in your way
If you live
