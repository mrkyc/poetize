Oh under some old towne Micanopy stars
While in the city of angels one angel lays
I'm dreaming of my lover counting sheep and scars
Oh it ain't like we're living as lackadaisical Kings
It ain't like we're all that alone in a world not fit for a queen
Open the gates and let the flood carry dirt out
For when the last hour dies and your eyes grow tired
And the booze don't work no more
And the Bible pages have disintegrated
Found cracks down in the floor
It's you and I alone, walking to the sea
You and I alone is all I ever need
You and I alone is all I ever dream and where I need to be
2400 miles away under some Southern California star
While in the city of angels, that angel lays
Calling to her lover on an old sand bar
Oh, it ain't like the given time will wait for our fare
It ain't like if I don't close my eyes
I'll be cursed if I can't meet you there
Open the gates and let the flood carry dirt out
You might also likeFor when the last hour dies and your eyes grow tired
And the booze don't work no more
And the Bible pages have disintegrated, found cracks down in the floor
It's you and I alone walking to the sea
You and I alone it's all I ever need
You and I alone is all I ever dream and where I need to be
2400 miles away
I'm laid out lonely begging for a dream...
Of you and I alone walking to the sea
You and I alone is everything I need
Yeah you and I alone is all I ever dream and where I need to be
Yeah you and I alone walking to the sea
You and I alone everything I need
Yeah you and I alone everything I dream and where I need to be
