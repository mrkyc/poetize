So I cut my teeth rebelling my way
I told myself I would not fail
I would not fall and I would prevail
But it just takes one hit to put you in your place
Well tell me what you want, I'm all ears
I'll give you all I got, blood, sweat and tears
Yea tell me what you need and I'll do my job
And meet you in the middle like it's going out of style
A one-way ticket is a recipe for sorrow
If you're counting down miles in the eave of a long haul
We're running on empty on numbers borrowed
With heavy eyes tripping between the lines and the dashboard
Bless your heart, bless your soul
I'm proud to buckle up with you to grow old
It just takes one hit to put you in your place
Well tell me what you want, I'm all ears
I'll give you all I got, blood, sweat and tears
Yea tell me what you need and I'll do my job
And meet you in the middle like it's going out of style
On a 50/50 deal, vowed to keep it real
While the world keeps spinning and tripping up our heels
Get steady, ready and roll
Holding fast down the road
To meet you in the middle like it's going out of style
If you haven't heard my voice in a while
I'll meet you in the middle like it's going out of style
Well I found myself on a lonesome highway
While you found yourself on a lonesome byway
Well tell me what you want, I'm all ears
I'll give you all I got, blood, sweat and tears
Yea tell me what you need and I'll do my job
And meet you in the middle like it's going out of style
On a 50/50 deal, vowed to keep it real
While the world keeps spinning and tripping up our heels
Get steady, ready and roll
Holding fast down the road
To meet you in the middle like it's going out of style
If you haven't heard my voice in a while
