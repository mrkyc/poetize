I've tried to find
Reconciliation
Behind the walls of those
Whose hatred burns

For I find it easier
To reach someone who still feels
Than to make amends
With passionless apathy
Where all lines are the same
A portrait cannot be made

I need to burn inside
I need to know that you are alive

I need to know that
Feelings of discontent
Are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand

Like a colorless sky
Over a sea of nothingness
Hatred faces its enemies
While apathy strikes furtively

I need to burn inside

I need to know that
Feelings of discontent
Are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand
I need to know that
Feelings of discontent
Are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand

Until our anger burns
Against injustice
We will create the faceless
By dismissing those forced to concede


Many of us have turned off the light outside
Erasing what exists beyond our front door
And for you, I find it harder
To reach common ground
Than my most glaring opposition
But what about those
Who've lost the luxury of choice?
Striving for identity, buried by our lack of interest
Souls marked as mere history
How much grievance will it take to awaken us?
I need to know that
Feelings of discontent
Are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand
I need to know that
Feelings of discontent
Are stronger than indifference
For those too weak to stand

How much grievance will it take
To awaken us from
The comfort of our homes?
The comfort of our oversized graves
