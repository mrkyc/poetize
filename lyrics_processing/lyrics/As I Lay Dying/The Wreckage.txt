The wreckage seemed too great for me
I saw my dreams collapsing, collapsing
But through debris, the tragedy
Not one of us died fighting
The wreckage

We somehow found a way
Through storming weather
Enduring skies turned grey
When we all said "never"

The winds, the rain
Downpour needed to cultivate

We don't get to choose when it rains
We can fight or just get washed away
Will we be transformed or
Feel like we're drowning, drowning?
The wreckage

So, use the storms ahead
To flood out shortcomings
And then use what is left
To water what is worth planting
The winds, the rain
Downpour needed to cultivate
Debris, tragedy
But not one of us died...
But not one of us died fighting

We don't get to choose when it rains
We can fight or just get washed away
Will we be transformed or
Feel like we're drowning?

Will we fight or just get washed away?
And now the mountains that we face
Are starting to look more like hills
We rose to a higher plain
So the whole horizon fell
It fell, the whole horizon fell

Through the debris of tragedy
Not one of us died fighting, fighting

We don't get to choose when it rains
We can fight or just get washed away
Will we be transformed or
Feel like we're drowning?
We don't get to choose when it rains
We can fight or just get washed away
Will we be transformed or
Feel like we're drowning?

The wreckage that once seemed
Insurmountable to me
Is now becoming
A part of rebuilding
We somehow found a way
Through storming weather
Enduring skies turned grey
When we all said "never"
So, use the storms ahead
To flood out shortcomings
And then use what is left
To water what is worth planting
