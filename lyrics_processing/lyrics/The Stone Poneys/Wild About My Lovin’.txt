Listen here, people now
I'm about to sing my song
Well, I'm going to St. Louis
And I won't be long

'Cause I'm wild about my lovin'
And I like to have my fun
If you want to be a regular girl of mine, babe
Bring it with you when you come

I'm crying sergeant
Sergeant, please
Well, the women 'round here
Won't let me see no peace

'Cause I'm wild about my lovin'
And I like to have my fun
If you want to be a regular girl of mine, babe
Bring it with you when you come

Oh well, I ain't the ice man
And I ain't the ice man's son
But baby, I can keep you cool
Until the ice man comes

'Cause I'm wild about my lovin'
I like to have my fun
If you want to be my girl, babe
Bring it with you when you come


Oh well, I ain't the grocer man
I ain't his son
But baby, I can give you everything you need
Until he come

'Cause I'm wild about my lovin'
I like to have, I like to have, I like to have
I like to have my fun
If you want to be my girl, babe
Bring it with you when you come

To tell you that my baby's gon-on-on-one from me
