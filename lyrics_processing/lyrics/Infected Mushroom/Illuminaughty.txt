Darkness rising
Calling out my name
Will it be changed
Or remain the same?
I have fallen
Far from above
Landing here
With such a bump

I have tasted of the fruit
And it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
That's so hard to satisfy
Drink from juicy lips
Delicious in a kiss
Allow yourself
I have tasted of the fruit
And it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
That's so hard to satisfy
Drink from juicy lips
Delicious in a kiss
Allow yourself

Illuminate me
The time is now
I know I've been seen
I just can't see how
When I'm hiding
Amid the throng
But nowhere is safe
From the ancient song

I have tasted of the fruit
And it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
That's so hard to satisfy
Drink from juicy lips
Delicious in a kiss
Allow yourself
I have tasted of the fruit
And it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
That's so hard to satisfy
Drink from juicy lips
Delicious in a kiss
Allow yourself
You can bury my heart
It won't stop the beat
Under it all
I have dancing feet
Like the gatekeeper knows
I'm weirding one
Dazzling spark
From a fallen sun

I have tasted of the fruit
And it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
That's so hard to satisfy
Drink from juicy lips
Delicious in a kiss
Allow yourself
I have tasted of the fruit
And it's opened up my eyes
It's given me a thirst
That's so hard to satisfy
Drink from juicy lips
Delicious in a kiss
Allow yourself
You can bury my heart
It won't stop the beat
Under it all
