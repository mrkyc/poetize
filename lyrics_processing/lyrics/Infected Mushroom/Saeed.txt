Again and again
Nothing to give
And no one to blame
During the day
I guess I'm okay

I feel ashamed
Again and again
Nothing to give
And no one to blame
During the day
I guess I'm okay
At night I sit by your side
Waiting for you
To give me a sign
I'm counting the days
And you've nothing to say
Ahhhhhh
I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside
And feel again
Cut the chain of lies
You've been feeding my veins
I got nothing to say to you
