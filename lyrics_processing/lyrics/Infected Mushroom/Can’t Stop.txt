And I can't stop thinking about moments that I lost to you
And I can't stop thinking about things I used to do
And I can't stop making bad decisions
And I can't stop eating stuff you make me chew
I put on a smile that you wanna see
Another day goes by that I long to be like you

And I can't stop thinking about moments that I lost to you
And I can't stop thinking about things I used to do
And I can't stop making bad decisions
And I can't stop eating stuff you make me chew
I put on a smile that you wanna see
Another day goes by that I long to be like you
And I can't stop making bad decisions
And I can't stop eating stuff you make me chew
I put on a smile that you wanna see
Another day goes by that I long to be like you

And I can't stop, can't stop making
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop shaking
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop making
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop making
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop

Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop
