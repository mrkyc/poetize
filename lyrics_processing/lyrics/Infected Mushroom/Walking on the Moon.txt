Walking on the moon
Walking on the moon

Take one moment to escape
It will change your mood
When you're walking on the moon
Walking on the moon, walking on the moon

Chase your happy place
It will change your groove
When you're dancing on the moon
Dancing on the moon

When we dance again
All our trouble seems to fade away
This is how I feel
When you take me to some levels that I've never been
When we dance again
All our trouble seems to fade away
This is how I feel
When you take me to some places that I've never been
