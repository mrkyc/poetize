A heart is a house for love
And I've learned (I've learned)
That it don't take much to build it up
(Build it up)
(Build it up, build it up, build it up)
Oh, oh

Two wrongs don't make it right
But too long was the night I kept you guessing
It's all I can do (All I can do, baby)
And hope that maybe you'll come around again

Now I see
That the wonder of devotion
(It doesn't, it doesn't come free)

A heart is a house for love
And I've learned (I've learned)
That it don't take much to break
A heart is a house for love
And I've learned (I've learned)
That it don't take much to build it up
Oh
You might also like
Today, I understand
I'll pay the price to be all the man you need
You know you got to be free
(Go find your way)
Go find your way, find your way back to me

Now I see (I see)
That the wonder of devotion
(It doesn't, it doesn't come free)

A heart is a house for love
And I've learned (I've learned)
That it don't take much to break
A heart is a house for love
And I've learned (I've learned)
That it don't take much to build it up, build it up
(A heart is a house for love)
And I've learned, I've learned, I've learned
(I've learned)
That it don't take much to break
(A heart is a house for love)
Hey, hey, hey
(I've learned)
That it don't take much to build it up
(Build it up, build it up, build it up)
Oh, oh
(Build it up, build it up, build it up)
Mhm
Build it up together and then it won't fall
(Oh, oh, oh)
Build a house so the heart can withstand through it all
(Is there a heart?)
Is there a heart in your house tonight?
(Stand up)
Stand up
(Stand up
Let me know, let me know that you understand)
Is there a heart in your house tonight?
(You got to have love)
You got to have love
(Love in your heart tonight)
Build it up together and then it won't fall
(Build it up)
Build a house so the heart can withstand through it all
(Two hearts belong together)
Build it up together and then it won't fall
(Two hearts are better than one)
Build a house so the heart can withstand through it all
(Build it up)
Is there a heart?
Is there a heart in the house tonight?
(Stand up)

Let me know that you understand
Better listen to me
Love doesn't come free
You gotta build it up)
