Hey, how you doin'? Really good to see you. Well, I'm doing alright, I guess. Still trying to do my thing. You've been away? Oh, I see. Well, I just got back in town myself. You know, there's, there's, there's something been on my mind for a long time but I couldn't tell anybody because they woulda thought I wasn't wrapped too tight. Well, look here, if you got a minute, let me tell you a little story about what I finally realized after the hurt and pain was gone, and the tears were gone from my eyes

Since you left, life don't mean a thing
I see the moon, I see the sunrise
But there's nothing in between
Sorry is the word, oh, but fool is what I really mean
'Cause when I touched you, girl, I touched a queen

I touched a dream, yes, I did, oh
I touched a dream

All I do is dream of fantasies, secret thoughts of love
Secrets of you and me and when we make love
Someone unreal will have to take your place
For without your love, my life is such a waste
I feel so bad because once the dreams were so real
And pride won't let me hide the way it feels

To touch a dream, strange as it seems, oh
To touch a dream, strange as it seems
You might also like
Since you left, life's been kind of mean
I tried another love affair but I couldn't feel a thing
Give me back the feeling, take this numbness from my heart
And give these hands of mine another chance
One more chance, oh

To touch a dream, strange as it seems
I touched a dream, strange as it seems
I touched a dream, strange as it seems
I touched a dream, dream, dream, dream
When I touched you, baby

You know, babe, I just realize, baby
Until you walk out the door, babe
I just realize I love you so much
Oh, don't, don't be so like that
To have a dream, to have a dream like you, baby
I touched a dream, dream, dream
Sometimes strange as it may seem
Come back one more time, baby
Let me put my hands on you right now, baby
Oh, oh, I touched a dream, strange as it seems
