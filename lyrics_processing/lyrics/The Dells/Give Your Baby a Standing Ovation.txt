And we would like to bring to you the stars of our show
All the way from the Windy City, the fabulous, the insurmountable
The incomparable, the mighty, mighty Dells!
Let's stand up and give them a great round of applause!
(Cheers and applause)
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen
You know we're mighty glad to be here today
And although we're the stars of our show, we know that there ain't all there is to it, because behind every great star as behind every great man, there is a woman
And I want to tell you out there that if you are a man, then you've got a woman
And I think you should take a little time out to salute that woman and give that woman a great big round of applause

Give your baby a standing ovation
