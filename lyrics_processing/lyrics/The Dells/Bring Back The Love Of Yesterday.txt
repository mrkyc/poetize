Let's pick up the pieces
And let's work this thing out
Bring back the love of yesterday
From me, you stole your love away
The look of love has left your eyes
Replaced with anger and despise
I can feel a chill in the air, it makes me cold
And filled with despair
This raw silence leaves me dangling in space
I'll sacrifice tomorrow just to see your smiling face
The seeds of jealousy are
Destroying the love you have for me
There's no other woman near
Other than you my lover
Give me the love of yesterday
Don't turn your back on me this way
My world is all wrapped up in you
Deep in your heart, you know it's true
So come on, bring it back, bring it all back now
Bring it back, bring it all back, girl
Bring it back, bring it all back now
Bring it back, bring it all back now
You might also likeYesterday, your love was warm and tender
But now today, you stir the love, I'm empty
Won't you tell me what's troubling your mind
Maybe the two of us, a solution we can find
I'll love you twice as strong
Till every seed of doubt is gone
There's no other woman near
Other than you my lover, give back
Bring back the love of yesterday
Oh, bring it all back now
Bring it all back now
Girl, you know and I know
We had a good thing going
And all those good times
Ain't no sense in blowing, ohh
Bring it back, bring it all back now
Bring it back, bring it all back now
You and me, we used to be
So good, so good
Now, can't you see
Bring it on home
Bring it back, bring it back to love
