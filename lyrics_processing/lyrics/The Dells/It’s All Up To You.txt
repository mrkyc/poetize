I'd write you a letter
If I had the blues today
You could make me feel better
I tried to be independent but
I know I'm fooling myself
I know I can only be
Just what you make of me
There'll never be anyone else
I could always be happy
I could always be blue
I'll be your friend or your lover
Baby, it's all up to you
I will be your fancy
(I'll be your fancy)
And I will be your dancer
(I'll be your dancer)
And if you want romance
Just follow me
(Follow me, follow me)
And I will be your pleasure
(It's all up to you)
And you will be my treasure
(It's all up to you)
Just give me half a chance
And you will see, you will see
You might also likeIf you want some music tonight
I'll sing at your window
If you wanted colors of life
I'd bring you a rainbow
Honey, for what it's worth
When you get down to earth
I need your love to be mine
I'll make a way for you
Do what I got to do
To make sure it works out all right
I would always be happy
I would always be blue
I'll be your friend or your lover
Baby, it's all up to you
I will be your fancy
(I'll be your fancy)
And I will be your dancer
(I'll be your dancer)
And if you want romance
Just follow me
(Follow me, follow me)
And I will be your pleasure
(It's all up to you)
And you will be my treasure
(It's all up to you)
Just give me half a chance
And you will see, you will see
I will be your fancy
(I'll be your fancy)
And I will be your dancer
(I'll be your dancer)
And if you want romance
