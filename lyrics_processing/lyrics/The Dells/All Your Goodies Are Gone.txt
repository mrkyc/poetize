Baby, I refuse to be blue
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
Shame, shame on me
For thinking that I could possibly be
The exclusive one of your choice
In this world infested with boys
When now I know that I am first on your list
And if I leave, I'm gonna be missed
I cannot take a chance on you
It's so easy to become number two
And I refuse to be blue
Baby, I'm crying you will lose
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)

(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
Let you see how does it feel
(Let you see how it feels)
To be un for real
(To be un for real)
To be without a love of your own
(Without a love of your own)
And all your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
So good I had known that your love is good
But it don't rectify how I'll cry if you ever say goodbye
I refuse to be blue
Meaning I'm cutting you aloof
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat, hurt put you in loser's seat)
Let you see just how does it feel
(Let you see how it feel)
To be un for real
(To be un for real)
To be without a love of your own
(Without a love of your own)
And all your own goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
All your own goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
Yeah, all your own goodies, they are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
It ain't gone
(All your goodies are gone)
Hey, your goodies are gone

Hey, hey, I'm gone
(All your goodies are gone)
Not coming back home
(All your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
