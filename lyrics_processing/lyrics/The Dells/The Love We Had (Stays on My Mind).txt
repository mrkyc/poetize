Lately babe, I've been thinkin'
How good it was when you were here
And it ain't the wine that I've been drinkin'
For once I feel my head is clear

But early this morning when I opened my eyes
That old lonesome feelin' took me by surprise
I guess you meant more than I realized

The love we had stays on my mind (The love we had)
The love we had stays on my mind (Stays on my mind)

And pretty girl, I've been rememberin'
The good times that we used to share
My thoughts of you don't have an ending
And memories of you are everywhere

But why should I tell you? It's not your concern
You win some, you lose some, I've lost and I've learned
It's just that I'm so lonely with no place to turn
And here at the end I'll find
You might also like
The love we had stays on my mind

Girl, if you were nearer, if you had a mirror
Maybe you could count my tears
And if you were nearer, it would all be clearer
How I wish that you were here
How I wish that you were here
(How I wish that you were here)

And baby girl, I was tired
So I lay down to dream a while
And lately I've been so uninspired
Without the comfort of your smile

But I'm not complaining 'cause that's how it goes
There's always some heartaches in this world I suppose
But you can't imagine, nobody knows
The love

The love we had stays on my mind
(Stays on my mind, stays on my mind)
The love we had stays on my mind
(I never will forget you, baby)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Why? How could I tell you)
The love we had stays on my mind
(No, no, no, no)
The love we had stays on my mind
(I never, never will forget you, baby)
The love we had stays on my mind
(It's so lonesome without you, darling)
The love we had stays on my mind
(I want you, baby)
The love we had stays on my mind
(I want you, baby)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Early this morning, I love you, baby)
The love we had stays on my mind
