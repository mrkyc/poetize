That sings everything's all right
The temperature is warm
The fire horses sleep
So gently comes the night
You close your eyes and stare
The ground they're on is bare
But once it was as deep
As wildest giants dreams
It's no longer there
And all of our desires
They mirror skies with flames
And smoke out heaven's halls
Who was that you called
They're no longer there
Here it goes again
Here it goes again
Here it goes again
What would you leave behind when all your fields are dead?
When your territories are dried out and your cities drowned and swept
What would you leave behind when those who bear your name
Are born in that place that you wrecked?
What would you leave behind when you're no longer there?

And hide within the hills
And softly close your doors
Pretend the world is safe
And wait for heaven's call
Or would you turn and face the seas
And come beside your cave
There's chance but if you dare
And swift as honour's steeds
Before it's no longer there
Here it goes again
Here it goes agaaain
Here it goes aga .. ain!
What would you leave behind when all your fields are dead?
When your territories are dried out and your cities drowned and swept
What would you leave behind
When those who bear your name are born in that place that you wrecked?
What would you leave behind when you're no longer there?
To deny or to despair
It's really just the same
Everything between
It means we have to change
Cos when a one forgets
The world begins to fade
And all the shapes and shades
That made the colours see
When they suddenly turned grey
