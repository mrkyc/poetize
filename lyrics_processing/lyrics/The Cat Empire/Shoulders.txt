Like the exorcist
When you saw me there you called
Can you spare a fifth?
I used to know you when you were small
How's it come to this?
How does a happy, bright boy
Fall into the rift?
And you carry weight on your shoulders
Won't you see that you are not inside yourself
You put that evil back inside yourself
I saw your Ma the other day
She asked me how you were
Say, 'one day you you'll be fine
But now you do it worse'
She told as she cried that
'No one breaks the curse'
As I looked into her eyes
My heart it nearly burst
And you carry weight on your shoulders
Won't you see that you are not inside yourself
You put that evil back inside yourself

And what if you reach out, knock on wood
I'm begging you please, won't you be understood
And won't you release, I believe you could
And if you ever wanna dream
I'll help you see the sky
And if you ever wanna scream
About some reason why
And if you ever break the seam
That cuts through your disguise
I love you when you're seen
And do my best to try
To carry weight off your shoulders
Won't you see that you are not here by yourself
Please don't put that evil back inside yourself
And what if you breathe and see you're good
And what if you reach out, knock on wood
I'm begging you please, won't you be understood
And won't you release, I believe you could
And what if you breathe and see you're good
And what if you reach out, knock on wood
I'm begging you please, won't you be understood
