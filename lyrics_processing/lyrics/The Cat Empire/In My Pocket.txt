And a piece of paper in my pocket deep
In my pocket piece of paper and a key
As i wander through the street
War, is there a war?
Or is there isn't a war anymore?
Somebody told me that nothing is for sure
Can you hear the ocean roar?
On each street is a tree
In the distance the desert sleeps
Sometimes a sigh is a song
When a breath is a melody
Oceans rise and oceans fall
So just what does tomorrow mean?
I give a smile, I give a song
For one moments eternity

And we sing
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh but it's a mob
Some mob that brought me here I know it is my job
To seek my fortune, Nanna thank you for this mob
Remember you now you are gone
Oh if I went away
Tropical island somewhere sunny every day
But everyone I ever cared about remained
Would I tan or would I fade?

In the distance the desert sleeps
Sometimes a sigh is a song
When a breath is a melody
Mountains rise and mountains fall
So just what does forever mean?
I give a smile, I give a song
For one moments eternity

So every morning he wakes
Spend his day at the daybreak
And every spoonful he take
Be of something his own make
Oh oceans rise and mountains fall
So just what does forever mean?
I give a smile, I give a song
For one moments eternity
