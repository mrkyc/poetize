Sing now muse, I won't be scared
She's wearing flowers, not snakes up in her hair tonight
And love, we've been around before
We washed up on the old shore, but it's new tonight

It's only light, she said
But we are liars to be free
Ooh ooh ooh
We steal the light to see

The hour falls, we fall to dance
The sirens and the marching band sing
It's nothing but chance tonight
A billion ones and many few
When everyone I never knew, they're here tonight

It's only light, we said
But we are liars to be free
Ooh ooh ooh
We steal the light to see

What if I'm lonely?
What if the sky should fall and disappear?
For one night only
Open your eyes and run into the clear
So if I may, what if I say it's good to have you here?

She said if you lead I'll come along
And if you need me there I'll sing your song tonight
And all that glows and all that shines
And all we leave behind will keep us warm tonight

It's only light, I said
But we are liars to be free
Ooh ooh ooh
We steal the light to see

What if I'm lonely?
What if the sky should fall and disappear?
For one night only
Open your eyes and run into the clear
I love you only
Until the skies fall down and disappear
So if I may, what if I say it's good to have you here?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
