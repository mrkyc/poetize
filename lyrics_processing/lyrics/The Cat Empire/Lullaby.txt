I cannot say "oh sweetness" like he could (like he could)
'Cause I cannot play a lullaby like it should

I used to cry but now I have to laugh
Because she's got that torment to a fine art
Smart like a foxy and crafty as a cat
I'm looking up as I'm lying on my back
Bite the beast, if i want a big piece of the pie
But she's taken the feast in the blink of an eye
I cannot justify what's going on
- it feels so right when it seems so wrong
Like a plot hatched in the sweet spot of that trap
- ask her what she's schemes she say "oh this and that"
Then she snaps like a camera in black with a flash
Puts the drum in the drama, the hand in the clap
She's a map with no bearings attached - no
Safety in this match, fire you can't catch
Then zap I was struck by that bolt before dawn
Then by breakfast honey we was signed and sworn

I give you all night movie marathon and a triple espresso so you can stay awake
It might be late - but it's never too late for that lovin', my sexy babe
See The Cat Empire LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also like
This game is no game but it's played all the same
And I love it even if it makes me deranged
It's like tears in the rain, burning spears in my brain
Cause me pain sometimes, make me drained
But I cannot complain
- mad the ugly good and bad
Had some happy with my sad and some tricks in my bag
When it's up run amok, like a bull that just bucked
When it's down it's a drag and you fight with no partner to tag
At times I would dive in the sea to escape from the rising and crashing Malea
Drink tea with a fat fish and find a golden key
Then rise to the surface and open my baby
And maybe she'd say "we are crazy", the two of us together like Melbourne weather
Be like balls in a maze, see we rolling along in obscurity
But when we meet in the middle say mmm it's a treat

I give you all night movie marathon and a triple espresso so you can stay awake
It might be late but it's never too late for that lovin', my sexy babe (Oh, my sexy baby)

Something always telling me "save your prayers before dawn"
'Cause what happens when I'm with you makes me shake my head then smile and yawn
I'm worn out but I'm beaming and it seems that we are dreamy
As we head out through that strange old morning door

She give me all night movie marathon and a triple espresso so we could stay awake
It might be late but it's never too late for that lovin', my sexy babe

Something always telling me "save your prayers before dawn"
'Cause what happens when I'm with you makes me shake my head then smile and yawn
I'm worn out but I'm beaming and it seems that we are dreamy
