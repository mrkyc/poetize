Song and melodies change and change
And sway, but they still stay the same
The songs that we sung when the dark days come
Are the songs that we sung when we chased them away
If I ever found a pot of gold
I'd buy bottles untold of the nectar of the vines
Cause I'm gonna die with a twinkle in my eye
Cause I sung songs, spun stories, loved, laughed, and drank wine

Tomorrow is another day
The cats are out to play, to play
That old rusty spaceship wants to sail
Into the milky way again
On a river of red, red wine

Run run run run run
Run run run run
Run run run run
Let's have some
Fun fun fun fun fun
Fun fun fun fun
Fun fun fun fun
Fun fun we'll
Drink drink drink drink drink
Drink drink drink drink
Drink drink drink drink
A toast to the
Sun sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun
Sun sun sun sun

Run run run run run
Run run run run
Run run run run
Let's have some
Fun fun fun fun fun
Fun fun fun fun
Fun fun fun fun
Fun fun we'll
Drink drink drink drink drink
Drink drink drink drink
Drink drink drink drink
A toast to the
Sun sun sun

In summer the bushfires rage and rage
And rage on such beautiful days
And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
Water we're desperately trying to save
So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
And sing on the beaches and swim through the night
Oh we'll cry, "Pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine"

Tomorrow is another day
The cats are out to play, to play
That old rusty spaceship wants to sail
Into the milky way again
On a river of red, red wine

Run run run run run

Run run run run

Oh what a beautiful day today
Today's a day to celebrate
Grab your bucket, grab your spade
We're heading down to Half Moon Bay
I saw a plane go into a cloud
I'm drunk, I'm singing, I'm happy and loud
Two o'clock in the arvo, but hey that's allowed
I'm having a good time and of that I am proud
