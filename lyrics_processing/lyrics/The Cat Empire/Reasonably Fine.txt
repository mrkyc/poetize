I lost my wife
I lost my keys
I lost my kite
And though I'm young at heart
I'm so much older
Subway eyes and banked up skies
And violent towns and frozen pies
And all them football crowds
Who lost are colder now
But you're the same as you
And I'm the same as me
And hopefully we can find
Ways to let us be reasonably fine
Reasonably fine
At least to beat my drums in time
Suddenly I've realised
That I won't be here when I die
And life upon this plane is somehow fleeting
Time and all it's precious wine
Somehow primed to make us whine
And fret even when we should be sleeping

And I'm the same as me
And hopefully we can find
Ways to let us be reasonably fine
Reasonably fine
At least to play my pretty chimes
Empty cries and hollow tubes
And all the signs that have no use
Fingers point accusingly, a cynic
Humanless hypocrisy
And all the crimes we didn't see
The side that knows the devil might be winning
But you're the same as you
And I'm the same as me
And hopefully we can find
Ways to let us be reasonably fine
Reasonably fine
At least to let my music shine
And maybe it's the greatest test
Man surrounded by his death
Reaches out and tastes the sweetest honey
That's how you make me feel
I love you more when death is real
It's sad, but in the end it might be funny
But you're the same as you
And I'm the same as me
And hopefully we can find
Ways to let us be reasonably fine
Reasonably fine
At least to leave an open mind
And you're the same as you
And I'm the same as me
And hopefully we can find
Ways to let us be reasonably fine
Reasonably fine
