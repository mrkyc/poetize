One day one woman asked him
What do you to survive?
He said 'oh my dear listen here'
And this is what he cried
On my feet I wear two shoes for dancing
Dancing to be free
On my feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy
On my knees they've got some cuts and bruises
From skating all my days
Cause when I'm skating with my friends
My troubles drift away
I say my legs they're wearing baggy pants
I like to move around
Cause getting down and jumping up
These are some good things that I found

Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the empire be rising
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak we making some lovin
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the greedy men running
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak got two shoes for dancin'

On my waist it's got a slinky belt
With a clip that's quick to open
Because loving is the sweetest thing
And from my waist it happens
And my stomach got some tasty food
That's making me feel good
Cause sharing some meals is something
I wish the world could do
Where my chest it wears a singlet
Where my chest it beating proud
Oh my chest suggest I am a man
That no institution can knock down
And around my neck is superstition
Hanging from a chain
Because I've got my gods but in the end
I make my own way

Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the empire be rising
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak we making some lovin
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the greedy men running
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak got two shoes for dancin'
And my mouth it's got a great big smile
That shows some great big teeth
To friends it brings a happiness
And to enemies it brings defeat
And my eyes they've got some vision
That can see through many lies
Or my eyes they look for better things
The better things to see in life
Where my ears are wearing head phones
That do play my favorite songs
Not music I'm told to like
But the songs that make me dance along
Cause on my feet are shoes for dancing
Dancing to be free
On my feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy
