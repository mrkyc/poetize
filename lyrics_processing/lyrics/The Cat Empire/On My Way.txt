Don't send me down the hole
Don't send me down the hole
Which way will it go go?
You never never know
You never never know
You never know the right way
Till you've been wrong, no
And if you want to shine
As your February clears
Would your March just disappear?
You hear it on the left
You hear it on the left
You hear it on the left left
Left then the right right
You're missing in the west
You're missing in the west
You're missing in the west
You followed the black kite
And even in your dreams
There are lights that can't be seen
And you're lost in where you've been
Well I'm on my way
To where I won't look back
I heard you say
With dismay
That we're living on the tracks
I hear the train
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Why do you deny-i
We're swimming in the sky
We're swimming in the sky
We're swimming in the sky
So low and so high high
And if you want to shine
As the sea looks to the stars
Well you're here, but very far!
And I'm on my way
To where I won't look back
I heard you say
With dismay
That we're living on the tracks

Oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Well I'm on my way
To where I won't look back
I heard you say
With dismay
That we're living on the tracks
I hear the train
On my way
To where I won't look back
I heard you say
With distain
That we're living on the tracks
