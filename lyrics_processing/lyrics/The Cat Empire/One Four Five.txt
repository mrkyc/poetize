Listen, doctor, I have pain
That grows inside myself
Shelf me please, I just can't ease the pain
I need some drugs to help
While pollution fills my lungs
And convolution fills my mind
Ow, my legs do ache, I contemplate
That living's less than fine
My spine does tingle when I think of being
Free from this curse
But what is worse I feel life is a bubble
Blown until it's burst
Oh, doctor, I am desperate
To get rid of this feeling
Oh, doctor, I am desperate
For some good soul healing

The doctor turned and gave a grin
And reached into his bag
But instead of an injection
Got a record with a tag
That said listen to this daily
With hip shaking and such things
Then he puts the record on
Grabs a mic and starts to sing, "You need some"

Doctor, I am feeling better
What was that you sang
Did you write it or recite it
Or just steal it from a band
All my bones seem to be stronger
And my spirit's feeling fresh
Woah, that dose of one four five
Has put the life back in my breath
"Yes yes yes," the doctor said
Then he sat me down and say
"Young man, don't think I wrote these chords
They're written in your brain"
And when you hear them there's a shakedown
That begins with the mind
'Cause these three chords make people feeling
Better all the time
Woah, they keep repeating
Like a scratch on a CD
But it's quality
'Cause these three harmonies breed positivity
Protect against insanity
Of modern insecurities
Believe me when I tell you
All you need is to be hearing all that
One four five
To make you high, to make you high (One four five)
To make you high, to make you high (One four five)
When they said what and you said why (One four five)
To make you high, to make you high (One four five)
At times like this you need some one four five
