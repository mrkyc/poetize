Are you ready?

If frizzy hair was a metaphor for festival time
Then this woman is a goddess of that festival shrine
Met her at a jam in a garden of sorts
I must confess, god bless, some impure thoughts
"Show us the money" was the call of the night
But no money could have bought even a piece of the pride
There might have been a sea of people I don't know
Because all I could see was how this woman she glowed so

Why, it's a pleasure to meet you
You look like one incredible creature
Wanna treat you fine, let's dance and grind
Get so funk-inflicted, it's a crime
You're divine you're sublime and well you blow my mind
You're so sly

She caterpillar so good that all the Greeks go, "Killa!"
Break and enter take ya like a glass of milk then (Spill ya)
Saw her coming, what a scene, what I mean she got
That sex coffee bean, but she tastes like vanilla
Well alright, she ignite when we hit the floor
Like the vroom on a super Commodore
Now if it makes a good story, well it's just worthwhile
With her's like dealing stories in a sprinkler style, it's so sly

Oh, do the Louis
Do the ja-ja-ja-ja Jenni
Do the boom-shak, hit-the-sack, back-seat's feeling alright
Feeling alright
Do the McShuffle
Rock it with a fine stride
Do the late checkout with a do-not-disturb sign outside
Now do the sly

Why, it's a pleasure to meet you
You look like one incredible creature
Wanna treat you fine, let's dance and grind
Get so funk-inflicted, it's a crime
You're divine you're sublime and well you blow my mind
You're so sly
You're so sly
