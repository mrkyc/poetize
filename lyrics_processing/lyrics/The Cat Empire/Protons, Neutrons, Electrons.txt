I've done too much of some things
And not enough of others
Just like whole life lovers
I've changed and changed
And changed and changed
From one thing to another
I've had complicated dealings
With complicated feelings
And I've cut and bruised and torn
I made blinds
On the windows of my mind
With the time that my back once wore
I'm a single person in this universe
And I am here to say to you
On the day that I die
I'll just give a smile
And fly into the blue
Cause we're all just-

Protons, Neutrons, Electrons
That rest on a Sunday
Work on a Monday
And someday soon
We'll be singing the old tunes
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, Zip-a-dee-doo
I'll be sitting on the porch with you
Then I'll die and I'll fly off
Into the blue

Some night I see the world
With its winds and its whirls
And I feel undefeated
(feel undefeated)
But every day I see the girl
With the strawberry curl
And I'm too shy to meet her
(too shy to meet her)
Some nights I go to bed
There's a ghost in the air above my head
And I tremble
(head and i tremble)
Sometimes I eat KFC
Other times I give up meat
And I just eat lentils
(just eat lentils)
I'm a single soul on this big blue ball
And I am here to sing a song
About the day that I was born
'Till the day that I'll be gone
And the song won't last for long
Cause we're all just
Protons, Neutrons, Electrons
That rest on a Sunday
Work on a Monday
And someday soon
We'll be singing the old tunes
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, Zip-a-dee-doo
I'll be sitting on the porch with you
Then I'll die and I'll fly off
Into the blue

And enemy is a remedy
To a malady in your melody
If you're strong not brittle
When a friend is a friend
Is a friend to the end
And it's AH so simple
A man is a man
And a woman is a woman
But the times we are living in demand
That a man can change
From a man to a woman
And a woman can demand to be a man
We're just flesh with socks and locks and frocks
And I am here to say to you
On the day that I die
I'll just give a smile
And fly into the blue
Cause we're all just

Protons, Neutrons, Electrons
That rest on a Sunday
Work on a Monday
And someday soon
We'll be singing the old tunes
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, Zip-a-dee-doo
I'll be sitting on the porch with you
Then I'll die and I'll fly off
Into the blue
Protons, Neutrons, Electrons
That rest on a Sunday
Work on a Monday
And someday soon
We'll be singing the old tunes
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, Zip-a-dee-doo
I'll be sitting on the porch with you
Then I'll die and I'll fly off
