I wished that spring would come to me
And I wished that I could dance up on the isles
Sweat rivers on a stage of steam
I let my thoughts begin to dream
I held my breath and ran into the wild
And each night a horizon grew
In all of us or just a few
Til morning's gold would make it disappear
Yet somewhere in my treasured chest
Is not forgot what must forget
But that's a feeling for another year
And movement has a way like words
You're there before the rhyme is heard
And all that one can do is shape the ride
The miles of a forgotten dream
Are yours my love it's where we've been
And maybe one day soon we will arrive
Playing all night loud
Playing all night loud
Sing it all night with me
All night loud

The nights unwound the records flipped
And stillness came like chaos in the lights
And voices like devotion flew
Across the sea from me to you
In music that I still cannot describe
And there were ugly times it's true
Some from me and some from you
And devils have a way of digging down
But a friend is not a friend for life
Unless your life is worth the strife
So hold on we'll be alright
Playing all night loud
Playing all night loud
Sing it all night with me
All night loud
There's a speech that I know well
Was told by Henry V I'll tell
A version that relates to us not war
'He who sheds his sweat with me
Will be my friend eternally
From this day to the ending of the world!'
No matter if we're young or old
Or in the sun or in the cold
I hope I can remember your bright eyes
Cos I know you and you know me
At least somehow mysteriously
So thank you my dear friends
And that's goodnight
I'm much obliged
I'm much obliged
So thank you my dear friends
And that's goodnight
I'm much obliged
I'm much obliged
So thank you my dear friends
