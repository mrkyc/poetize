To the gods in the sky, there's one thing you can do
You can send us some sun and we'll play you this tune
Because sitting in our room, lying down with a scoob
And the sunshine through our window

Oh, it's days like these that'll make us happy
Like a puppy getting lucky with a Lassie
Or hassle-free hours passing by with that beat (One, two)
Singing, "Days like these", kicking back
Just doing what we do

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

Number one, I wanna find some loving in the sun
With someone that can make me growl and hum
Say, "Hmmm...", a boom, a boom shak
And the beat that she throw at me, knocking me flat
Number two, I'd cruise where the grass is smooth
And the sound of the sea is a dreamy melody
Snooze all afternoon
'Til the night time wake me, 'cause shakedown soon
Number three, I'd be dancing like a monkey up a tree
I find sweet simplicity by kissing my honey
Get funky like Bond when he's played by Connery
And crafty like Don Corleone
Four, watching Oliver jam a little more
Remember the night when I saw
What I never, never, never seen before
Lavender wrestling a rich, wild boar

Whack, beats splat, wake up on the attack
Work myself frantic to the moon and back
Now it's evening and the sausages are frying out back
I write my rhyme for this track, as the skies fade to black
Now I remember earlier in the day
As I was swimming through the bay
A bass player I know swum my way
He said, "G'day, hey, you wanna go see some reggae?
Starts at eight, and plays through to sunrise the next day"
So 9 o'clock sees me heading out towards the tabernacle
Hardcore reggae beat bring me feet out of these shackles
Hardcore reggae DJ, I salute you, crackle, crackle, crackle
Crackle of the vinyl, now I'm high, now a spectacular night ahead
I met a Mexican called Juan
(There's a party on the hill, would you like to come?)
Yeah (And bring a bottle of rum)
Can't afford it, but I bought it
And then I sung
It's nights like these when you know that you're alive
Nights like these when you know that you got vibe
Nights like these when you don't have to try
Fall in love and kiss and smile from every girl walking by
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And my eyes want to cry 'cause the night and the sky
Is so high and my life is sublime and it's mine and it's time
(It's now time)
Oh, it's nights like these when you know that you're alive
Nights like these when you know that you got vibe
Nights like these when you laugh until you cry
Nights like these when I'm drowning in your eyes
(I feel like I've been living)
Nights like these when you know that you're alive
(My life from the beginning)
Nights like these when you know that you got vibe
(And all the songs I'm singing)
Nights like these when you laugh until you cry
(Is all the love I'm giving)

Oh, it's days like these that'll make us happy
Like a puppy getting lucky with a Lassie
Or hassle-free hours passing by with that beat (One, two)
Singing, "Days like these", kicking back
Just doing what we do
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

And dirty hands, I like them see
They make the music that we play sound oh, so sweet
And my mother always made me eat broccoli
And now look at me, oh, I'm as strong as can be
So put some spice in my sauce, honey in my tea
An ace up my sleeve and a slinky plan B
And most importantly, my mad family
