Coming down hard
Need you so fast
Need you so right away
Like a road train
I need you babe
Let's burn it all away
But I love you like water
You give me order
It's getting hotter
Believe me when I say
That like a spring rain
I need you babe
But nothing last forever after all ....
I'll love you til the ocean takes us all
This is the story of two lovers like twins
They would do lovers things blame original sin
Look into their eyes only for the meaning of the hour
As if there only everything existed in their power, yet
Lo and behold they drifted of a stream humming
How does it go? Oh 'Life is but a dream'
Well the steam became a river and the river start to tow
They, they didn't notice at all
I love you like oil
Coming down hard
Need you so fast
Need you so right away
Like a road train
I need you babe
But nothing last forever after all ....
I'll love you til the ocean takes us all

Screaming, 'Stop gazing and swim to save us all!'
But the twins they didn't hear at all they whispered nothings
Down the waterfall
And for what? Why did love become this void?
When the ones we love are the one we would destroy
Have you heard about the phrase says 'Ignorance is bliss'?
Well, what bliss could lead to this
When I need you like water
You give me order
It's getting hotter
Believe me when I say
That like a spring rain
I need you babe
But nothing last forever after all ....
I'll love you til the ocean takes us all
I love you like oil
Coming down hard
Need you so fast
Need you so right away
Like a road train
I need you babe
Let's burn it all away
But I need you like water
You give me order
It's getting hotter
Believe me when I say
That like a spring rain
I need you babe
But nothing last forever after all ....
