Look
Self-awareness
Pride's a coat and yes, I like to wear it
Buttoned up, don't like to let no air in
With a pair of gloves that I hope doesn't perish
I discovered, though, when I get holes in them
And I let joy in, I'm in higher spirits
My mistakes are like a screamin' parrot
Just repeatin' lyrics, I can barely bear it
When I'm lost
Road is narrow
I'm lookin' down it like a gun's barrel
Aren't we all searchin' for the serum
That could help us breathe and leave our state of peril?
All of us have made defensive scarecrows
That we scatter 'round our fields and treat like heroes
When they scare away the things that we should cherish
'Cause we're too embarrassed to admit the fear is
That we're lost
Yeah, but what does it matter?
I get so combative, inside of me's a personal canvas
The paint can be splattered, get messy when I start to get rattled
The heart of a savage, I'm quiet when I lurk in the shadows
But somethin' don't add up, I don't wanna be overdramatic
But look at the data, it's obvious that humans are fragile
We tend to get mad at the ones that call us out but the fact is
We need someone that'll be honest when we fly off the handle
I admit I throw a fit when I begin to unravel
Keep my wits, been off the grid but now I'm back in the saddle
My intent is not to rent, I like to own what I value
I could sit here on the fence or maybe pick up the paddle
I like to row against the current, that's the way that I travel
Opposite of what the grain does, got the brain of a rebel
Take initiative, I'm diligent on every level
I never could settle, I like to keep my foot on the pedal, yeah
I'd love to pack arenas and all
But what I really wanna do is learn to handle my thoughts
And put the reins on 'em, show 'em I'm the one that's the boss
And pull 'em back when they get out of hand, I'm breakin' they jaws
I'm takin' the flaws, that told me I could never evolve
Then pull a Bane on 'em, ask 'em, "Oh, you think you're in charge?"
You oughta know better, ain't no way around it, I'm flawed
The traits that I want, they say I can't afford what it cost

But I, manifested this
Failing's how you grow and learn your lessons, kids
Take the worst and try to make the best of it
'Cause when you fail, just know that it's a test and if
You can learn to pick yourself back up again
And train your brain to not be such a pessimist
It's okay to make mistakes, just don't forget that
There's a high road but I skip the exit
When I'm lost (Lost)

Yeah
When I'm lost
When I'm lost (Lost)
When I'm lost
When I'm lost, lost

Wow, these burdens are heavy
And I'm hopin' it don't bury me
I used to be joyful and skip so merrily
But now I'm too cautious and tip toe carefully
My mind left and it's nowhere to be
Found, am I a big ol' parody?
'Cause it's no fair to me
And now I'm at the point where
I'm spendin' a grand a week on hypnotherapy
Look, I'm tryna wash away my sins
I got a group of loved ones that ain't my friends
And if I ever take an L then they might grin
And they all wanna see me stay in the cage I'm in
So when it come to anybody, there's no trust for no one
Man, so what? My whole plan's to go nuts
My shoulders ready for more shrugs, I'm gon' judge
Anybody tryna enter my circle with no love (Hol' up)
My sanity's gone, I'd rather be torn
From this planet they planted me on, yes, that's a reward
I'm actually bored with havin' a sore heart
It's torn apart from a family that I don't have anymore (Man, hol' up)
I was livin' so oblivious
With millions, it really was a pity, huh? (A pity, huh?)
It's kinda funny what a penny does
Mixed in with a mini buzz (I feel stuck)
Life's got me by the neck, with a blade against it (What?)
Guess I was runnin' late for the train and missed it (What?)
The only thing I feel is pain and vengeance (What?)
So I'ma act out like a ragin' misfit (What?)
And every verse I lay gon' stay sadistic (Yeah)
You wanna hate me? Good, great, terrific (Good)
You'll never see the day where my anger's dismissed
You better go and change your wish list 'cause I
Yeah, manifested this
Do not treat me like some adolescent kid
I am prayin' to the Lord with the Book of James
Hopin' He gon' add my testament
This dark cloud, that's my residence
Demons knockin', I don't have to let 'em in
I done made mistakes, day to day
You probably can't relate
I just ain't the same when I'm lost (Lost)

Yeah
When I'm lost
When I'm, when I'm lost (Lost)
When I'm lost
