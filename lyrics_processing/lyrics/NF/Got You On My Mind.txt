Ooh-yeah

Started with phone conversation and I
Flew out to see you, it's rainin' outside
We sat by the water and talked about life, oh
Said you lost your dad, girl I know how that feels
I lost my mom, tryna deal with that still
I guess we connect on our hatred for pills
It's real

I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

You got me thinkin' things I never used to
I'm not the phone type, I'd rather be with you
Sometimes I hold back from sayin', "I miss you"
But I miss you
I have to admit, on this road I get lonely
But you make me smile every time that you call me
You let me be myself, you don't control me

Got you on my mind yeah, tell me what the deal is lately, the
Deal is lately, deal is lately
I'm-I'm-I'm a man of my word, girl believe that
I'm a closed book, but somehow you learned to read that
Know that I should relax, hate the way I react
Thinkin' that I'm good, but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Thinkin' that I'm good, but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
