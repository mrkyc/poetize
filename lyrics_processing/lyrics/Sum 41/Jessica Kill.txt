Oh, my love, how do I explain how I've come to feel this way
I'm addicted to the pain even more than words can say
Every hit hurts like your kiss, like a needle to a vein
My last words of this begin, "I want you..."

She said, "you don't even know how just how much I need it
How far will you go?"
(I just want to feel you cum...)
You make me so crazy, but I'm okay
Just pain me, take it very slow
'Cause I'm in love tonight

So, now that it has come to this, I'll be your dirty little thrill
For the world I wouldn't miss, 'cause I just want to feel your kill
Self-inflicted masochist, how could anyone resist?
My last words of this begin, "I want you..."

She said, "you don't even know how just how much I need it
How far will you go?"
(I just want to feel you cum...)
You make me so crazy, but I'm okay
Just pain me, take it very slow
'Cause I'm in love tonight

You fear them both as they take your breath
Tell me the difference between love and death
You fear them both as they take your breath

And all of this comes to an end
But I cannot resist your death

She said, "you don't even know how just how much I need it

(I just want to feel you cum...)
You make me so crazy, but I'm okay
Just pain me, take it very slow
