Today is too late
How long do we have to wait?
Oh no, I think she knows
That's why I can't let go
I feel this burning inside
A feeling that no one should know
This could be so good again
I'd wait here till then

I'm done with this
So now I'll leave with

No apologies
I never thought you'd be so easily deceived
Now I'll just hang my head (I'm falling further out of place)
While I walk with the dead (All the lies I can't erase)

I'll just hang my head

We're mad with regret
Memories that we'll both forget
So far it's been so hard
To cover up these scars
I see this falling apart
It's easy to just let it go
No luck between us both
So I keep waiting

I'm done with this
So now I'll leave with

No apologies
I never thought you'd be so easily deceived
Now I'll just hang my head (I'm falling further out of place)
While I walk with the dead (All the lies I can't erase)

I'll just hang my head

What's left to show?
It's so bad, but I got to know
What's right? Don't know
How to find it out on my own


One by one, we both fall down
But who's the first one to hit the ground now?
What's worse, to kick or fall or
Be stuck standing alone
Well, I'll keep your promises if you
Take back everything I said
I find it's got so cold now
That I've lost my heart and soul
No apologies
I never thought you'd be so easily deceived
Now I'll just hang my head (I'm falling further out of place)
While I walk with the dead (All the lies I can't erase)

I'll just hang my head
