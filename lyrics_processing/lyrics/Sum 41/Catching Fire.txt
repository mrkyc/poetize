I never told you how I felt
Though I thought I'd said it all
And I never knew you needed help
Well, 'cause you always seemed so tough
But now I'm here alone
Without you by my side
If only I had known
That you kept it all inside
Now I'm trying to understand
Just trying to find a way
But forgive you, I just can't
It's all just too much for me to take

And if I failed you, well, I swear I tried my best
But now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
Just so you know
You meant the world to us, I know that it's too late
And all I want's another chance, I can't accept that you have left

Look at all this damage done
Are you happy with yourself?
And we thought the best was yet to come
And, and I thought I knew you oh so well
And the days just go by
While the moment seems to last
Like catching fire
All is gone, and it all went up so fast

Just so you know
You meant the world to us, I know that it's too late
