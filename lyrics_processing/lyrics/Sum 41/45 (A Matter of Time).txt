You're something to few, but nothing to me
Someone so twisted and sick as can be
It wasn't the plan, we gave it a shot
You've proven a real man is something you're not

So tell me, is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
A total abomination is what it looks like to me
No reasonable explanation, can't call it a declaration
A bigot to all, sick of it all, we all stand up, go

I believe that I
Am losing faith in all of humankind
But then I realize it's plain to see
That a number is all you are to me

Not worthy of name, a number you'll get
A symbol of meaningless, void of respect
A matter of time, you get what you've earned
We'll take pleasure in watching you burn

So tell me, is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
A total abomination's what it looks like to me
It's a masochist fascination, a character assassination
You're the fool on the hill, we're stuck with you 'til we all stand up, go

Go

I believe that I
Am losing faith in all of humankind
'Cause then I realize it's plain to see
That a number is all you are to me
I believe that I
Am losing faith in all of humankind
But then I realize it's plain to see
That a number is all you are to me
I believe that I
Am losing faith in all of humankind
But then I realize it's plain to see
That a number is all you'll ever be
