Hard rock, hallelujah!
Hard rock, hallelujah!
Hard rock, hallelujah!
Hard rock, hallelujah!

The saints are crippled on this sinners night
Lost are the lambs with no guiding light
The walls come down like thunder, the rock's about to roll
It's the arockalypse, now bare your soul

All we need is lightning with power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising, give us the sign
Now let us rise up in awe

Rock 'n roll angels bring then hard rock, hallelujah
Demons and angels, all in one, have arrived
Rock 'n roll angels bring then hard rock, hallelujah
In God's creation, supernatural high

The true believers, thou shall be saved
Brothers and sisters, keep strong in the faith
On the day of Rockoning it's who dares, wins
You will see the jokers soon'll be the new kings
You might also like
All we need is lightning with power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising, give us the sign
Now let us rise up in awe

Rock 'n roll angels bring then hard rock, hallelujah
Demons and angels, all in one, have arrived
Rock 'n roll angels bring then hard rock, hallelujah
In God's creation, supernatural high

Wings on my back, I got horns on my head
My fangs are sharp and my eyes are red
Not quite an angel or the one that fell
Now choose to join us or go straight to Hell
Hard rock, hallelujah!
Hard rock, hallelujah!
Hard rock, hallelujah!
Hard rock, yeah!

Rock 'n roll angels bring then hard rock, hallelujah
Demons and angels, all in one, have arrived
Rock 'n roll angels bring then hard rock, hallelujah
In God's creation, supernatural high
Rock 'n roll angels bring then hard rock, hallelujah
Rock 'n roll angels bring then hard rock, hallelujah

Hard rock, hallelujah!
