I crash and burn asking you, you to look away
I crash and burn wondering why it is that you stay
I know it isn't pretty how I can't handle everything
But you never give up on me

When you love me so damn good
I know I will get better
When you hold me so damn good
I know I will get better
Give me wood, shelter, wood through every bit of weather
How is it that you never give up on me?
How is it that you never give up on me?
Never give up on me
Never give up on me

I sink into a blue that tucks me into sleep
It's easier to close my eyes than to hear my demons think
But you wake me better than the morning's rising sun
And you never give up on me

When you love me so damn good
I know I will get better
When you hold me so damn good
I know I will get better
Give me wood, shelter, wood through every bit of weather
How is it that you never give up on me?
How is it that you never give up on me?
Never give up on me
Never give up on me

When the lights go out, you give me a spark
Show there's healing when we're dancing in the dark
Lay me down under a blanket of stars
And watch as they illuminate all our scars

When you love me so damn good
I know I will get better
When you hold me so damn good
I know I will get better
Give me wood, shelter, wood through every bit of weather
How is it that you never give up on me?
How is it that you never give up on me?
How is it that you never give up on me?
How is it that you never give up on me?
Never give up on me
Never give up on me
Don't you give up on me, oh-oh
