Okay, on your marks, get set, go!

I'm sorry that I'm not around
I've been chasing my dreams with my head in the clouds
Years pass and my friends are all gone
I guess it seems I got lost in this song
Come home to dust in my bed
To plants that have died from lack of being fed
And missed funerals and birthdays
Never meant to miss life while I was away
Away

We've been chasing this all of our years
It goes far beyond all our blood, sweat and tears, oh
We've been chasing this all of our years
Want it so bad, you're willing to face all your fears
You've been told that you're never gonna get it
You've been told that you're never gonna get it
But you know that what's burning you is brighter than gold
And I'll chase it 'til the day that I go

Remember the night we walked from Bleecker to Ditmars
Oh, we talked of our dreams 'til the sunrise
Over the Queensborough Bridge with our eyes open wide
Still keep that moment with me
When we're up on that stage screaming victory
Oh, I'm terrified of who I'd be if I never had a melody
Terrified of who I'd be

Well, we've been chasing this all of our years
It goes far beyond all our blood, sweat and tears, oh
We've been chasing this all of our years
Want it so bad, you're willing to face all your fears
You've been told that you're never gonna get it
You've been told that you're never gonna get it
But you know that what's burning you is brighter than gold
And I'll chase it 'til the day that I go

Oh, the doubt paves my insides
Body so tense, it's paralyzed
Fearful of these butterflies
But they're just your friends dressed in disguise
But they're just your friends dressed in disguise
And we'll take their wings to reach great heights
One, two, three, four

We've been chasing this all of our years
It goes far beyond all our blood, sweat and tears, oh
We've been chasing this (We've been chasing)
All of our years (All of our years)
Want it so bad, you're willing to face all your fears
You've been told that you're never gonna get it
You've been told that you're never gonna get it
But you know that what's burning you is brighter than gold
