Tangled in one bunk because we can't sleep
If I don't feel your arms wrapped around me
Been to every rest stop in the country
Without you, oh, this dream would feel so empty
Turn to you after we play the first song
To ask you if I fucked it up and sang wrong
There across your face, the biggest smile
That makes me feel invincible just like a child

Say, what we wanna
Do, make it all come
True, because nothing is impossible with you
Say, what we wanna
Do, make it all come
True, because nothing is impossible with you

Open my eyes
To see you and I
Can't believe this is life
We're coloring outside the lines
Open my eyes
A saturated sunrise
Doesn't seem as bright
When we're coloring outside the lines
(Coloring, coloring, coloring)

They say time slips away when you're having fun
That's why you said, "Let's change our life to a dull one"
Don't wanna blink one day and this will all be over
If only time could stop so we'd never grow older
Yet in the same breath, I look forward to the day
When our skin has aged, I'll love you just the same
Our canvas will have endless hues and shades
Because of all the vivid colors that we made, oh

Say, what we wanna
Do, make it all come
True, because nothing is impossible with you
Say, what we wanna
Do, make it all come
True, because nothing is impossible with you

Open my eyes
To see you and I
Can't believe this is life
We're coloring outside the lines
Open my eyes
A saturated sunrise
Doesn't seem as bright
When we're coloring outside the lines
(Coloring, coloring, coloring)
No matter the day
No matter the night
Our love will keep burnin'
Keep burning bright
No matter the low
No matter the high
My darling, our love will
Will never run dry

Open my eyes
To see you and I
Can't believe this is life
We're coloring outside the lines
Open my eyes
A saturated sunrise
Doesn't seem as bright
When we're coloring outside the lines
