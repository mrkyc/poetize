Never was afraid of death
Now you got me stressing about every single breath
When life is too good to be true
Makes you skeptical of what you're about to lose
See, now heaven has got nothing on us
Oh, I love you even when my body turns to dust
My heart slowly beats for you
Drummer boy, you've made me feel every single hue

You saved my soul
Turned a broken girl into whole
And I thank the day
That led you my way

Taking me higher than the clouds go
Looking down at the world far below
No matter how far our feet may roam
Next to you is where I call home

What did I do
To deserve you?
What did I do
Oh, to deserve you?
What did I do
To deserve you?
What did I do, what did I do
To deserve you?

Watched men throughout all my years
Cause nothing but abuse and flooding tears
So I stayed far on my own island
Never dared to let anybody in
Then you came and turned my world around
For the first time, I was writing happy sounds
You are brighter than you'll ever know
Make the sun appear to have a much duller glow

You saved my soul
Turned a broken girl into whole
And I thank the day
That led you my way

Taking me higher than the clouds go
Looking down at the world far below
No matter how far our feet may roam
Next to you is where I call home

What did I do
To deserve you?
What did I do
Oh, to deserve you?
What did I do
To deserve you?
What did I do, what did I do
To deserve you?
Never want to wake up next to anybody else
Never in my life did I want to hear the wedding bells
You make me believe in something I claimed untrue
Set my fears on fire, like a phoenix, I am new
With you, I am new
Every scar fades away
Less existent with each day
They fade away

Taking me higher than the clouds go
Looking down at the world far below
No matter how far our feet may roam
Next to you is where I call home

What did I do
Hey, to deserve you?
What did I do
Oh, to deserve you?
What did I do
To deserve you?
What did I do, what did I do
