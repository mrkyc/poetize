Out of tune piano, you're looking like my life
All the keys are here, but they don't sound quite right
Out of tune piano, you're bringing me down, down
Make me face all my fears, cut me open like a knife, ah

Try to bleed out all of my doubt
Try to silence all my tyrants
They're so heavy, pulling me deeper into the ground
But my heart resounds with

Love yourself, my dear
La-la-la-love yourself, my dear
Go on and love yourself, my dear
La-la-la-love yourself, my dear
Do I make myself clear?

Out of tune piano, take me back to the day (Back to the day)
When all my demons were small, I didn't know them by name
Out of tune piano, give me some clarity
Where I don't feel like I'm sinking into the depths of the sea

Try to bleed out all of my doubt
Try to silence all my tyrants
They're so heavy, pulling me deeper into the ground
But my heart resounds with

Go on and love yourself, my dear
La-la-la-love yourself, my dear
Oh, these words are hardest to say
When you never see yourself that way
Love yourself, my dear
La-la-la-love yourself, my dear
Do I make myself clear?

Celebrate your struggle and know that it's a gift
Entertain all your troubles with the wind, let them drift
Because the worst of times
Could be the best of times for someone else's trip
Taste the salt in your tears
Knowing that it's the foundation beneath your ship
