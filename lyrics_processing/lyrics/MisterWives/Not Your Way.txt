Over being told
To be undressed to look our best
Everywhere my eyes go
Our figure is less, voice oppressed

Oh, but look how very far we have come
Cast a vote, wear pants, and prop up a gun

No, it's not your way, not your way
Not going to obey, to obey
This is my body, body
And you don't have a say, have a say
This is my own life, own life
Not growing up to be a trophy wife
So don't parade us 'round, 'round we go
In your twisted world
And I'm saying no, no
No, it's not your way, not your way
No, no, no, no
No, no, no

Lower and lower our standards go
As your money grows
Fill us up with plastic and cut us up
And tie a bow

Oh, but look how very far we have come
Strip us of our width, disguise it like we have won

No, it's not your way, not your way
Not going to obey, to obey
This is my body, body
And you don't have a say, have a say
This is my own life, own life
Not growing up to be a trophy wife
So don't parade us 'round, 'round we go
In your twisted world
And I'm saying no, no
No, it's not your way, not your way
No, no, no, no
No, no, no

Are we making ourselves clear?
We're all the same under here
This is my disposition
Apologies for breaking up tradition
It takes two to tango
When we're saying
... 2, 3!
Not your way, not your way
Not going to obey, to obey
This is my body, body
And you don't have a say, have a say
This is my own life, own life
Not growing up to be a trophy wife
So don't parade us 'round, 'round we go
In your twisted world
And I'm saying no, no
No, it's not your way, not your way
No, no, no, no
