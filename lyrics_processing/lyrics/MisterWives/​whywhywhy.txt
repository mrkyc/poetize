I turn up my speakers
So I can drown my thoughts just a little bit quicker
Dancing barefoot in the dead of winter
So I can numb this heart that's full of splinters

They say time heals
All wounds, but these clocks are at a standstill
And I'm counting every second that you're not here
But only in my dreams do you appear

Am I allowed to lay down my smile
And be bitter just for a while?

Don't keep pulling me under, we were meant to stay afloat
I see all the embers, they've not yet lost all their glow
Could you try to take a look into my eyes?
And tell me why, oh, why, why, why?
Why, oh, why, why, why?
Why, oh, why?

I close all the windows
Draw the curtains hoping that the sun knows
All I see is you when the day glows
Reminding me that you are just a shadow

When I wake
For a split second in time, my heart does not ache
Thinking you'll be next to me, then I shake
To see an empty bed and all over, I brake

Am I allowed to lay down my smile
And be bitter just for a while?

Don't keep pulling me under, we were meant to stay afloat
I see all the embers, they've not yet lost all their glow
Could you try to take a look into my eyes?
And tell me why, oh, why, why, why?

I should have known when you were grinding your teeth
(I should have known)
That you were hiding your feelings from me, oh
I should have known when you were tossing in your sleep
(I should have known)
That you were hiding your feelings from me

Don't keep pulling me under, we were meant to stay afloat
I see  the embers, they've not yet lost all their glow
Could you try to take a look into my eyes?
And tell me why, oh, why, why, why?
Don't keep pulling me under, we were meant to stay afloat
I see all the embers, they've not yet lost all their glow
Could you try to take a look into my eyes?
And tell me why, oh, why, why, why?
Why, oh, why, why, why?
Why, oh, why, why, why?
Why, oh, why, why, why?
