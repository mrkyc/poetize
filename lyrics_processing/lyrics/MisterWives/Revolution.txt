Hiding under sheets with the news on repeat
'Cause the screams and cries are hard to delete
While I'm trying to sleep, oh, how could I sleep?
Laying in bed, trying to empty my head
All these acts of violence ripping this world to shreds
While I'm trying to sleep (Trying to sleep), oh, how could I sleep?

Eyes don't deserve to see life in color
Until we stop taking the lives of our brothers
Oh, fall back asleep (Fall back asleep), oh, how could I sleep?
Bombs being dropped, innocent lives are shot
Capable to shift my brain to think happy thoughts
While I'm trying to sleep (Trying to sleep), oh, how could I sleep?

Wish there were words to say to make a change
Oh, the words to sing to end this suffering

Let's start a revolution where we all stand as one
'Cause we need to make a change for a new day
We need to be the generation that'll awaken a solution
'Cause we need to make a change, make a change
Make a change for a new day

Detached from these terrors, we watch from afar
Sending prayers and wishes upon empty stars
While I'm trying to sleep (Trying to sleep), oh, how could I sleep?
This guilt is a twisted privilege to have
Makes me thankful my strife is just a fucked-up dad
As I fall back asleep, oh, how could I sleep?

Wish there were words to say to make a change
Oh, the words to sing to end this suffering
Wish there were words to say to make a change
Oh, the words to sing to end this suffering

Let's start a revolution where we all stand as one
'Cause we need to make a change for a new day
We need to be the generation that'll awaken a solution
'Cause we need to make a change, make a change
Make a change for a new day

I wish there were words to say to make a change
'Cause, oh, we need to change, oh

We'll start a revolution where we all stand as one
'Cause we need to make a change for a new day
We need to be the generation that'll awaken a solution
'Cause we need to make a change, make a change
Make a change for a new day
Let's start a revolution where we all stand as one
'Cause we need to make a change for a new day
(Oh, we need, oh, we need to)
We need to be the generation that'll awaken a solution
'Cause we need to make a change, make a change
