Used to know how to do
This without losing my cool
But you crept too much inside my head
Rolling over in my bed
Tangled up in what you said
Terrified this just might never end

Easy on my tethered soul
Giving you all I got
But you claim it ain't whole

It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
Easy on my tired eyes
They've been up all night
'Cause my mind is tied
It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you

Chasing the days away
Back and forth, this game we play
It's sickening, but we can not quit
How did we get so far down
Run ourselves into the ground
Pull us up for air, but we still drown

Easy on my tethered soul
Giving you all I got
But you claim it ain't whole

It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
Easy on my tired eyes
They've been up all night
'Cause my mind is tied
It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you

I am down on my knees
Begging for release
Can't continue like this, no
So could you please
Change your eyes to see
This is no way to be, no (oh)
I am down on my knees
Begging for release
Can't continue like this, no (oh)
So could you please
Change your eyes to see
This is no way, no way, no way to be
Easy on my tethered soul
Giving you all I got
But you claim it ain't whole

It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
Easy on my tired eyes
They've been up all night
'Cause my mind is tied
It's the best I can do
