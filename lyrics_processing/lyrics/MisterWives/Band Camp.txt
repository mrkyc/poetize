No, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't want it any other way
And we love, and we love, and we love being so far away
And we go, and we go, and we go to the woods where we can play
There we keep, yeah, we keep, oh, we keep all the monsters at bay

The stars don't burn as bright way back at home
Out here, we've got a case of sky's the limit syndrome
Smell of firewood and fresh pine etched in our minds
Keep me here forever, perfect moment in time

Little souls aligned, little souls
How did we find
A heaven, a haven?
Such a perfect moment in time

No, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't want it any other way
And we love, and we love, oh, we love being so far away
And we go, and we go, and we go to the woods where we can play
There we keep, yeah, we keep, oh, we keep all the monsters at bay

Secret fortress, leave our worries at the door
Watch your step, instruments spread out on the floor
Burn all inhibitions, throw them into the fire
That we gather 'round, to dream and conspire
