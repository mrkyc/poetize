The wind-soft melody
Sings to me so happily
When you're near me, everything is just so right
When all seems so wrong
Your love reminds me where we belong
You make my cloudy, dark skies so bright

So can we
Stay forever-ever like this
And laugh and love in this happy bliss
And as time runs through our fingers
This love, this love will stay and linger
So hold me close and never, never let go
And promise to love it every high and low
These words you are singing to me are my everything
My everything
You're my everything
My everything

The planets and stars
And Venus and Mars
No, they don't measure up to you
No, no
And nothing can compare
To you, this I swear
This life we've strung, let's
Never, never undo
