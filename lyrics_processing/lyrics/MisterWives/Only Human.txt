Desires are fed, but do we feel full?
As it crept in our bed, I tried to keep my cool
But there's an emptiness I cannot undo
I know you didn't mean harm, I know it's so unlike you

But we're human, only human
As beautiful as the sea, glistening so dangerously
Oh, we're human, only human
Like a moth to a flame, we can't resist love's game

Oh, we know, oh, we know it was wrong
It killed me to see you so gone
You let your head get too withdrawn
From your body, only thinking with your body
Oh, we know, oh, we know it was wrong
But we will find our way along
'Cause what we have is too strong
And nobody can tear us down, nobody

Drank 'til we sank into the ground
Where we hit such a low, embarrassed to make a sound
I caught your blue eyes resembling waterfalls
And in that moment, I knew no words need to be said at all
