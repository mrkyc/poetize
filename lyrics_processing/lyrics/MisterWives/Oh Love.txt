Pick yourself up off the floor
Voice won't be silenced anymore
These wings will soar
Struggle to open your eyes
Swollen from all of your cries
Look to the sunrise

And I know that the weight is pulling you down
We didn't come all this way to let love drown
Keep my head up, try to stay above the water
But my heart keeps sinking

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
'Cause I need hope
That these sticks and stones won't break my bones

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?

Lifted the veil, we're all sinners
Crowned the devil a winner
And you tell me that it'll be just fine
Scarier than any bad dream
Can't wake up from his regime
So don't tell me to sit down and dine

And I know that the weight is pulling you down
We didn't come all this way to let love drown
Keep my head up, try to stay above the water
But my heart keeps sinking

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
'Cause I need hope
That these sticks and stones won't break my bones

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go, go?
Go, go
Excuse my pessimistic tone, I normally can do better
But the battle to keep my light burning seems harder than ever
These walls of hate will suffocate
And one by one, we will deflate
So this I cry and this I pray
Our card will trump and you will break, oh

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
'Cause I need hope
That these sticks and stones won't break my bones

Oh love, where did you go?
