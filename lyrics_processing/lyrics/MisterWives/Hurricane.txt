Leeches, you're sucking up the life
Creatures, you're not afraid to fight
We're not letting you steal all that molded us
If you only knew you're only made of dust

We are not your property
See with our own clarity
Ears closed, eyes open, voice won't be broken
Won't dance within your walls

You'll find us running 'round every town
Unchained on all your bounds
Everyone's used a crown
Throwing your words to the ground
We'll do this our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane
We dance to our own beat
Won't sing to your melody
We don't care if we're the only
People swimming in the sea
We'll do this our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane

Made me care what you think
Only made our bodies sink
Couldn't continue playing the game right
Rambling with you is your fake right
Tell me how it's good for us again
Raise your brow, get it out, and condescend
This is not working, my lungs are choking
No longer at your call

You'll find us running 'round every town
Unchained on all your bounds
Everyone's used a crown
Throwing your words to the ground
We'll do this our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane
We dance to our own beat
Won't sing to your melody
We don't care if we're the only
People swimming in the sea
We'll do this our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane

Don't go change your fold
What happened to being bold?
Shaking of what we were told
Not fitting to your mold
We'll do this our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane
We are not your property
See with our own clarity
Ears closed, eyes open, voice won't be broken
Won't dance within your walls

You'll find us running 'round every town
Unchained on all your bounds
Everyone's used a crown
Throwing your words to the ground
We'll do this our own way
Can't change the storm of a hurricane
We dance to our own beat
Won't sing to your melody
We don't care if we're the only
People swimming in the sea
We'll do this our own way
