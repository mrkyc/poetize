You tried to dodge your own bullet
But it shot you anyway
You crossed over every line and
Hid behind the lines you made

And do ya, do ya? Do ya, do?
And do ya, do ya believe in the truth?
And truth be told that truth found its way
To the twisted tongue that spoke dismay

I know that I may be young
But at least my youth is wise
You painted a picture to me
That depicted only lies

And do ya, do ya? And do ya, do?
And do ya, do ya believe in the truth?
And truth be told that truth found its way
To the twisted tongue that spoke dismay

'Cause your sweet is sour
You're a weed, not a flower
Just a pretty-faced coward is you
Your heart's just an organ that
Pumps nothing more than blood
To your vainful veins
You struck each chord and now it's time for
Your real song to be sung
You just managed to mask what's now clear as glass
And that's just: you're an asshole

You weaseled in and out of words
And denied when truth was heard
May your yes be yes and your no's be no's
Not an in-between land of I-don't-know's

And do ya, do ya? And do ya, do?
And do ya, do ya believe in the truth?
And truth be told that truth found its way
To the twisted tongue that spoke dismay

'Cause your sweet is sour
You're a weed, not a flower
Just a pretty-faced coward is you
Your heart's just an organ that
Pumps nothing more than blood
To your vainful veins
You struck each chord, now it's time for
Your real song to be sung
You just managed to mask what's now clear as glass
And that's just: you're an asshole

And this I say one last time
You define your own crime
You best hang up your disguise on the laundry line
Stabbed me in the front, stab me in the back
And this right here's my heart attack
So if I don't go, I pray you know
Just how much you blow
And do ya, do ya? Do ya, do?
And do ya, do ya believe in the truth?
And truth be told that truth found its way
To the twisted tongue that spoke dismay

'Cause your sweet is sour
You're a weed, not a flower
Just a pretty-faced coward is you
Your heart's just an organ that
Pumps nothing more than blood
To your vainful veins
You struck each chord, now it's time for
Your real song to be sung
You just managed to mask what's now clear as glass
