We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never...
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
And she don't clap the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days? Don't you miss the danger?

Cause we don't  do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
Cause we don't  do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs....

Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
Oh, don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the lines, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the lines, stay in the line
