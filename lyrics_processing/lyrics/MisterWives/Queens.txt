Stoop livin' was a heaven that we fit in
Summer sun, we would run far away from our fears
Waiting for the train in the winter
Couldn't hide and our trees were froze in tears
Mama said she'd always keep us warm
Roof over our head, even though it was torn

My Queens is a queen
Not talking bright lights and shiny things
But we always made it work
Building castles out of dirt
My home is a throne
Not very pretty, but tough as stone
And we always made it work
No matter how much it did hurt

Bought my first keys at fifteen
Not for a car, play my songs at every shitty dive bar
Big dreams in the biggest city
She don't care if you ever make it far
Mama said, "Don't ever lose sight
Stay true to your voice inside"

Building castles out of dirt
My home is a throne
Not very pretty, but tough as stone
And we always made it work
No matter how much it did hurt

But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
'Cause love is strong enough
But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
'Cause love is strong enough
