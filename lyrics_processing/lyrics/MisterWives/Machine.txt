Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Pick apart every piece of me
And miss the point entirely
I only did this to be sane
Not for you to know my name
Go 'head and spit the music out
Please tell me more about your doubt
Don't fear, I've heard it all before
Each time makes it easier to ignore

Oh, I am tired of abiding by your rules
Causing me to second-guess my every single move
You don't know who I am or what I have been through, no
So don't dare tell me what I should and shouldn't do 'cause

Not here to lose
Not here for you to choose
How we should be
'Cause we're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part
We're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part
We're not part of your machine, no

Don't feel like having a computer sing this phrase
Not looking for a hired name to write a song for me that sounds the same
As everything fed to our brain's rammed down our throats with no complaints
Maybe I'm a dying breed, but I believe in individuality (Hey)

Oh, I am tired of abiding by these rules
Causing me to second-guess my every single move
You don't know who I am or what I have been through, no
So don't dare tell me what I should and shouldn't do 'cause

Not here to lose
Not here for you to choose
How we should be
'Cause we're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part
We're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part
We're not part of your machine, no
Hey, hey

Told to look and act a way as if I'm just a ball of clay
That you can mold into whatever, I assure you that's not clever
See, now fads don't last forever, they are fleeting like the weather
And we will stand our ground while you will sink and drown
Ha ha ha ha ha!
'Cause I'm a tough girl, I run my own world
And if you don't like it, there's the door
If you haven't heard, I ain't got no interest in your business
Just here for the music and there's nothing else to this bullshit
Woah-oh-oh-oh, 'cause
Not here to lose
Not here for you to choose
How we should be
'Cause we're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part
We're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part
We're not part of your machine, no
