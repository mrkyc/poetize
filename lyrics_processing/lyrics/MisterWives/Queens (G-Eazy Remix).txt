Stoop livin' was a heaven that we fit in
Summer sun, we would run far away from our fears
Waiting for the train in the winter
Couldn't hide and our trees were froze in tears
Mama said she'd always keep us warm
Roof over our head, even though it was torn

My Queens is a queen
Not talking bright lights and shiny things
But we always made it work
Building castles out of dirt
My home is a throne
Not very pretty, but tough as stone
And we always made it work
No matter how much it did hurt
Eazy, yeah, a bus pass and a dream
Things are not actually what they seem
Need drive, need the gas and the steam
Ten years, a love for the craft and my passion is seen
When examining my past as a team
A young mind inside a old soul
I wanted what we didn't have
When I was told no, I snatched and irrationalized
Thought world was cold so spent my sixteenth in juvie
She said "fuck you stole for?"
I got out, shared a blunt with my moms
She said you have a voice to share stories in these songs
Don't fuck it up
As I would slowly see
She had always kept a roof over me in Oakland
Made a home and that's what molded me

Building castles out of dirt
My home is a throne
Not very pretty, but tough as stone
And we always made it work
No matter how much it did hurt
But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
Cause love is strong enough
But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
Cause love is strong enough
