I was just barely holding on
Trying to keep up
I saw no signs of anyone
Box built around the Sun
I thought to sleep the day away
But dreams were as dark as the night's way
How did you hear the drop of my tear?
You chase all the fear

You were there for the waking
My soul was sleeping
You woke me, shaking every piece of me
You took me under
Eyes wide to you with wonder
Built me a heart strong
Carried me on

We find light down any road we take
Feet never seem to break
Unable to feel unstable
When you carry me all the way
I take comfort in your ways
Keep me feeling safe all the days
Whoa, oh oh
Your presence gives me joy alone
Never do I face the world alone

You were there for the waking
My soul was sleeping
You woke me, shaking every piece of me
You took me under
Eyes wide to you with wonder
Built me a heart strong
Carried me on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on

Put away the days
When home is what I've chased
When love had no space to live
This world we built
Is long passed filled
My hands can now
Hold onto a shield
My hands can now
Hold on to a shield, shield
My hands can now
Hold on to a shield, shield
Opened up what I had sealed, sealed
Opened up what I had sealed, sealed

You were there for the waking
My soul was sleeping
You woke me
Shaking every piece of me
You took me under
Eyes wide to you with wonder
Built me a heart strong
Carried me on and on and on

On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
