Do you know
That this is the end?
I know you are not gonna
Get down on your knees
You're not going to repent
But hey!
You left me with nothing
So there's plenty of things to regret
'Cause I was fighting
I was fighting
I was fighting
But you left me for dead
There was a time
When I saw light in you
There was a time
When it was all about you
But we're not getting closer
We're just getting older
We're gonna perish in the flames
Is it worth it?
Is there anything more I can say?
To make you see that you should see
What it was that you were doing to me
Oh, but everything is different now
And I'm not who I used to be
Well, the change is that I need you
Just as much as you ever needed me
You might also likeHey!
There was a time
When I saw light in you
There was a time
When it was all about you
But we're not getting closer
We're just getting older
We're gonna perish in the flames
And until you grasp
What it is that you do
Everyone you need in life
Will fade away from you
'Cause we're not getting closer
You're just getting older
You're gonna perish in the flames
