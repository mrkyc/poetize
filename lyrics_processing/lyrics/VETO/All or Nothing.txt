My loving serious as a heart attack/
Soon as I leave they want me back/
Call it cardiact/
Screw they heads up/
Once they got they legs up/
Oh we ain't talking now, I guess she fed up/
Hook
Well truth is/
Just love me like I is/
I'll take you how your are/
Or else we got to part/
I tried hard trying to love one person/
And they all broke my heart seems it's all for nothing/
Verse 1
Hey!, Now tell me what we oughta start it wit/
Guess I gotta hit her with the Baby Mama starter kit/
She saw the life and said ""Boy I want part of it""/
I told well the d**k girl you gone take all of it/
I got a small budget meaning I don't spend much/
Praying to the lord hoping I ain't to send it up/
My life private as f**k/
I like to teach myself/
I got along just fine without a teachers help/
You here to waste my time or elevate my stress load/
Im hoping that it's neither one cause baby there's a boat load/
Of different T.H.O.T.'s and I show am aware/
I don't let' em come with, I leave them ho*s over there/
Yeah/
Im looking up cause I just had my worst year/
Should of gave up/
But a ni**a still here. Yup/
Them type of injuries can kill your whole career/
And I know you say you care but I still got fear/
(Cause I)

I tried to give my whole heart to a woman/
I tried to be committed and loving/
I tried to be your boy friend and husband/
Lord knows I tried and it was all for nothing/
I tried to give my whole heart to a woman/
I tried to be committed and loving/
I tried to be your boy friend and husband/
Lord knows I tried and it was all for nothing/
(I tried)
Verse 2
You know some women do things that you can't stand/
And ladies yes I know you can't love every man/
Why would you wanna?/
Some of em don't deserve it/
They be cheating with your friends and then a leave you out deserted/
I been that way but now I've fully been converted/
Mannish as a little boy now Im a grown man perverted/
I played serpent/
Now it's full surface/
Searching for the best, on my quest, to stay earnest/
I be, sharing moments avoiding calls when the phone ring/
Broke as hell but love don't cost a damn thing/
They say Im in to deep because I let my feelings show/
And cause I love the ladies, well ain't you pose to though/
Give me a woman and I only need one/
She should love me as a baller or a God damn bum/
Better find yourself a partner or you'll find yourself alone/
And I always got a lady Im the type they bone/
(Cause I)

Verse 3
I know it's hard and it's down right scary too/
But love the one you with and commit to the one your married to/
Yeah happiness gone come and go/
But the benefit of having somebody is wonderful/
They make you feel deprived/
You don't need 'em in ya life/
Everybody hear me out take a veterans advice/
Now here I go again searching for a wife/
Hoping that I luck out whether wrong or right/ (cause I tried)
Chorus
