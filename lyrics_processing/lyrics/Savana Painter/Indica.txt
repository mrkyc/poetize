I see you want it all night long
I, I, I
You want me to
You want me to
To do your body baby
Do your body baby
Three bears
One porridge
Tempted fi touch it all
But mi only want
One
One
One honey
Drop, Drop draws inah di morning
Nuh wear nothing at all, Nuh garments
Weeks now we nuh touch
So you know mi torment
Keep on the stilettos
Squeeze tight
Nah make you leggo
Slap it up, Slap it up
Worse mi under mi hygrade
The vibe really loud
Mi tell yuh say ah you me want
Love, Ah yuh me love
Skin it out, Skin it out
Dig out mi red
Wine up, up on the buddy head
Slide inside like ah your last time with concubine
Yuh fuck before yuh come yah the last time
Skin it out
Skin it out
Dig out mi red
Wine up, up on the buddy head
Slap it up call you when am lonely
When am in the mood
You might also likeSo many bottles of boose in the coupe
Rubber bands cause I like to twerk in the goose
Drip wet, that's why your bitch left
The maverick, misfit
Even with distance we got somu different
Empty pockets don't ever Make the grade
That's some Billie Holiday
Satin and lace in your face
Drag car, race trace
Gone for a ride
I'll call you on way back
Who said bliss is only for rich
Psychoactive, indica make yuh see passion inah yuh flaws
Deh pussy yah a yours alone, nobody ask

The vibe really loud
Mi tell yuh say ah you me want
Love, Ah yuh me love
Skin it out, Skin it out
Dig out mi red
Wine up, up on the buddy head
Slide inside like ah your last time with concubine
Yuh fuck before yuh come yah the last time
Skin it out
Skin it out
Dig out mi red
Wine up, up on the buddy head
Slap it up call you when am lonely
When am in the mood
Colorado cocktail, that sticky icky
Vision so clear, man I miss the village
They don't wanna brawl
They don't wanna scrimmage
Sawed off shotgun fucking with hill billies
Different strokes for different folks
Gangsta alone mi make bust it off
Ever diss me with a artist gal
Retaliate and fuck your rival
Me alone fi jump up Ina your thoughts
Me alone fi tell your say, mi love your heart
Breast a get squeeze up
Slide inside it
Ride it
Ride it
Ride it
Breast a get squeeze up
The vibe really loud
Mi tell yuh say ah you me want
Love, Ah yuh me love
Skin it out, Skin it out
Dig out mi red
Wine up, up on the buddy head
Slide inside like ah your last time with concubine
Yuh fuck before yuh come yah the last time
Skin it out

Dig out mi red
Wine up, up on the buddy head
Slap it up call you when am lonely
