Fell out with the love of my life
What was I thinking, thinking
Now your gone, am still in my feeling
Babe said keep one in a chamber
Put your brains in it
Studies are major, use mercury eliminate the evil spirits
Dreams so vivid, stimulate the raphsody
Take it all, take it all off
Sunset, hilltop
They see me shining, shining
VVS diamonds, Inna the vibes me live
There's no amount of riches to replace your love
The vibes just fuck up now
Ooh babes, everything fuck up now
Mi a sport, big car
Switch car, all the while
Cruise lane, everything just coming like it full of pain
Miss your face
Won't let these dreams fade, dreams fade
Am from a town where we rock away
Don't let these dreams fade, dreams fade
Dem can't take your place
You might also likeBattling these demons, demons
Fell out with the love of my life
What was I thinking, thinking
Now your gone, am still in my feeling
You didn't have to do it
You didn't have to ruin
You didn't have to go
You didn't have to go
I was in depression the worse way
Flew you out on my birthday
I knew you was blessed
In the way it rained that day in California
Hotels and movies
Wanted you all to myself, so everything was low-key
This sadness got my heart compressed
Feeling like I can't breath
I live without regrets, but for you my love is o.d
Give me the antidote, am sick I need it
Miss the smell of your lips
Miss the smell of neck, Burberry
Mixed with my Gucci Bamboo
Love you
Won't let these dreams fade, dreams fade
Am from a town where we rock away
Don't let these dreams fade, dreams fade
Dem can't take your place
Battling these demons, demons
Fell out with the love of my life
What was I thinking, thinking
Now your gone, am still in my feeling
Now your gone, am still in my feeling
Still in my feeling
Still in my feeling
