You want Savana fi tick tick-tock and jump up pon it
Confide inna you ah mi terrified
Harnessing these feeling am speechless
Divine love pouring down my crown
Salacious images, wine, and dip
We can't stop now
Can't escape you on top now
Penetrate the core
Aye!

When gal a wine, gal a wine up

When gal a wine, gal a wine up
Dem never know say she bad so

Popcorn and Sprite

Just a little touch and mi tingly

Stimulate excitement, make the neighbors Dem say we too loud
Tight grip, squeeze it up little bit
So, inah mi absence yuh get ah, mental arousal
