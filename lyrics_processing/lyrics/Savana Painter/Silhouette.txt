Royal palaces, beaches we know seh there's leeches everywhere
So we never leave home without my backbone
If ah nuclear missiles, yuh know seh we nuh back down
Silent river run deep, suh wi just float with the top down
Top baller, shot shaller
Di killy killy dem hot dadda
Hot grabba
Mi ah sweat out mi moschino, Dolce n Gabbana
Darkness increase, devil Inna Prada
Gi dem a black death, dem think a black magic
Body fold up stink like 10 day cabbage
Chase him fi a mile and we knock it and knock it
We see it say the badness Dem a try copy
Dawg, Dem a bawl illuminati, when gal a goddess
Yuh caa beat di wizard
Yuh caa see di tackle when it a touch
Approach wid a different form
Look how we just make little breeze blow and dem think a storm
Approach in the shadow of a silhouette
Silhouette
Approach in the shadow of a silhouette
Boy violate and him haffi get wet
Boy violate and the whole place wet
From dem violate the whole place wet
Approach in the shadow of a silhouette
Silhouette

Never born with gold spoon Inna mouth, straight out mud
Capitalism dem try use fi stop yuh progress, we progressing
We smile all through the pain
Ask mommy fi tie her belly and fast
Cause di pussy dem wah mi body reach morgue
Dem can't wrap mi up inna shrouds, an-uh talk mi ah talk
When we done dem religious beliefs still can't get dem outta di grief
Fell in love with loyalty, but loyalty never love me
They fell in love with the dead franks
Everybody wants glitz, Everybody want diamonds
Mind tougher, make Dem feel the pressure
Expose dem to the adversity, forces elusive
This a real life anuh like when dream lucid
Approach in the shadow of a silhouette
Silhouette
Approach in the shadow of a silhouette
Boy violate and him haffi get wet
Boy violate and the whole place wet
From dem violate the whole place wet
Approach in the shadow of a silhouette
