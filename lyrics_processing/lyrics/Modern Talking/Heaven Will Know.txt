When I'm down and feelin' blue
I close my eyes, oh, just to be with you
I'm a dreamer and you know
You are my woman and I'll never go
God put an angel here on earth (Here on earth)
Who gave me more than all I'm worth
You are my angel in the night
In the darkness you're the light

Heaven will know, oh, heaven will know
My love will grow, baby
Heaven will know that I need you
So I can't say goodbye, lady

Heaven will know that I'll never let go
And I'll stay until my heart stands still
No matter what, baby, be what you are
Heaven send me an angel, heaven send me a star


Don't let me down, take my hand
Now and forever be my friend
Take my lovin' heart tonight
You are a woman 'till the morning light
I dry the tears I've never shown (never shown)
An empty house I call my own
You are my angel in the night
In the darkness you're the light
You might also like
Heaven will know, oh, heaven will know
My love will grow, baby
Heaven will know that I need you
So I can't say goodbye, lady

Heaven will know that I'll never let go
And I'll stay until my heart stands still
No matter what, baby, be what you are
Heaven send me an angel, heaven send me a star

And it's more than a passin' face
And it's more than a few nice days
And it's more than I've never known
And I'll never be alone

Heaven will know, oh, heaven will know
My love will grow, baby
Heaven will know that I need you
So I can't say goodbye, lady

Heaven will know that I'll never let go
And I'll stay until my heart stands still
No matter what, baby, be what you are
Heaven send me an angel, heaven send me a star
Heaven will know that I'll never let go
And I'll stay until my heart stands still
