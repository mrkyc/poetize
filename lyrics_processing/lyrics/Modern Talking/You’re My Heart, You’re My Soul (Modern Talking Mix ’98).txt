97.8 on your FM dial, you're listening to the funkiest station in the nation
And today, we're just Modern Talking!

Here's the number one track for the love of my life
Everything I sacrifice just to make her my wife
You kick me hot like fire, never cold like ice
I'll pay any price 'cause she's just that nice
Every line of my rhyme is dedicated to you
And I'll always be true, never will you be blue
You're the best for me, I'll love you till I grow old
Worth more than gold 'cause you're my heart and soul

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever, stay with you together
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know

My heart and soul!
You might also like
I can imagine I was stranded on an island with her
And not a soul in the world knew where we were
I visualize and hypnotize, lost in your fur
And I love you more than anything on this earth
Give up the fortune and fame, commence to living alone
Home alone, don't ever answer the phone
But every breath I take make the truth unfold
Let the whole world behold you're my heart, you're my soul!

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever, stay with you together
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever, stay with you together
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
