Going through a motion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart
Cheri cheri lady
Living in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part
Cheri cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart - don't lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby, I'll be always yours
The lady of my life is out, and when you feel
The real deal, giving you nothing but sex-appeal
You steal my mind, all the time, it's like a dream
Wanna play on your team, for your love, I'm a theme
Can't do without, make me scream and shout
I'm a sucker for your love, true love without a doubt
So tell me right now that you'll be my baby
Come on, cheri cheri lady

Can you feel all this love that I have for you
Can nobody in the world do me like you do
You can ask my truth, see my life ain't the same
No more silly games, I must admit I change
Take you for a cruise all around the world
Give you everything, from precious diamonds to pearls
I speak this way because you drive me crazy
My cheri lady
