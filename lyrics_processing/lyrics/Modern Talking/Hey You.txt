She has a heart of gold
The way to paradise is cold
I know, I know that this world is a show
Love you more than words can say
There is a will, there is a way
I know, I know that this world is it so

I want you, hey you, feel brand new
Oh, I break the golden rules
Time is on my side
I want you, hey you, take a chance on me
Baby, put your love on me
I want you tonight

I want you, hey you, little boogaloo
Shot a hole right in my soul
Hey girl, hey girl, take this chance for love
I want you, hey you, little boogaloo
You want me and I want you
Hey girl, hey girl
You're the one that I'm dreaming of

You might also like
I'm tired of being alone
Oh, girl, it's easier said than done
I know, I know that this world is a show
Oh, you wasted days and nights
Give me the chance for paradise
I know, I know that this world is it so

I want you, hey you, feel brand new
Oh, I break the golden rules
Time is on my side
I want you, hey you, take a chance on me
Baby, put your love on me
I want you tonight

I want you, hey you, little boogaloo
Shot a hole right in my soul
Hey girl, hey girl, take this chance for love
I want you, hey you, little boogaloo
You want me and I want you
Hey girl, hey girl
You're the one that I'm dreaming of

I want you, hey you, little boogaloo
Shot a hole right in my soul
Hey girl, hey girl, take this chance for love
I want you, hey you, little boogaloo
You want me and I want you
Hey girl, hey girl
You're the one that I'm dreaming of
I want you, hey you, little boogaloo
