Don't get left behind
I can feel the music movin' through me everywhere
Ain't no destination, baby, we don't even care
There's a place to be if you need the right education
Let it take you there

And just go with the magic, baby
I can see it there in your eyes (I can see it there in your eyes)
Let it flow, stop the waiting
Right here on the dance floor is where you gotta let it go

Don't stop movin', can you feel the music?
