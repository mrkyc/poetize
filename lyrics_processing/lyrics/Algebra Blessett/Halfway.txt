Take me back one time
See, I live you, breathe you
Love ya, need you
Couldn't see you loving anyone but me
But baby, baby, can't you see
That you are the song I sing
And I would never hurt you game you
Try to play you love the way you
Made me your everything
But baby, baby, can't you see
It ain't the way it use to be, no
It's like I
I've given all I got
Jumping all you hurdles
And getting nothing back
And you never used to say
Let me call you right back
Now when I call your phone
I gotta leave a message at the tone
I love endlessly
Said I'm playing for keeps
But I need you to meet me halfway
Every promise I made
Said my love wouldn't change
So I need you to meet me halfway

Road so only
Walk it when you know it's true
I thought I found a path in you
But I'm on an empty avenue
Now when I guess what she said thinking you cared
Baby, I swear it's like it's somebody new
So let me know what I should do
'Cause right now I'm so confused
It's like I
I've given all I got
Jumping all your hurdles
And getting nothing back
And you never used to say
Let me call you right back
Now when I call your phone
I gotta leave a message at the tone
I love endlessly
Said I'm playing for keeps
But I need you to meet me halfway
Every promise I made
Said my love wouldn't change
So I need you to meet me halfway
Hey DJ?
I love endlessly
Said I'm playing for keeps

Jumping all you hurdles
And getting nothing back
And you never used to say

Aye DJ?
And I thought we had something real
So let me know what it is 'cause
I gave all I could give
And you left me guessing
And I thought
We had something true but I ain't
Get no love from you
Let me know what I should do
'Cause I can't keep guessing
It's like I
I've given all I got
Jumping all your hurdles
And getting nothing back
And you never used to say
Let me call you right back
