It's funny how some things stay on your mind
It's funny how some moments hang in time
I remember when we met
How we became good friends
But I don't remember when
When you started to go astray, and for what reason
Did you finally go away?
Why did you leave me?
If it were anyone else
I could cut all my ties
But you're a part of my life
And it's starting to feel like

Everywhere I go, I hear your name
And I play it off like things are the same
Pretending to know the reason why
That it's not...
Whoa...

What happened, baby?
What happened, honey?
To the way things used to be?
What happened, baby?
What happened, honey?
To the way things used to be?
You might also like
Every day I try to block you out my head
I haven't seen you
I just don't know what to say
We used to spend time
We used to be fine
You had my heart
Now we don't even talk
Like we used to
Baby, this is not what I'm used to
Tell me, where did it go?
I'd do anything to know
That it was not all in vain
And there was a reason
That you went away

Everywhere I go, I hear your name
And I play it off like things are the same
Pretending to know the reason why
That it's not...

What happened, baby?
What happened, honey?
To the way things used to be?
What happened, baby?
What happened, honey?
To the way things used to be?
See, I tried
Over and over again
To get some understanding
So I can know where we're standing
So...

What happened, baby?
What happened, honey?
To the way things used to be?
What happened, baby?
What happened, honey?
To the way things used to be?
What happened, baby?
What happened, honey?
To the way things used to be?
What happened, baby?
What happened, honey?
To the way things used to be?

What happened to our love?
