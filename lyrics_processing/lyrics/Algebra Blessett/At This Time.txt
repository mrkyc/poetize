At this time
In this place you are, are mine
And at this moment in my life, you belong to me...
Oh wee... Oh...

I don't think it's wrong
I can't help it
I ask my heart
If she felt it (I did)
I can only ask for so much (please)
I will only settle for this touch (right here)
My arms brag to each thought about how you feel
From conversations I know what they feel is real
The past it didn't last
The present went too fast
The future so will be I wish that far I could see but

At this time, at this time
In this place, you are mine
And at this moment
In my life
You belong to me
Oh, to me...
You might also like
Forgive me if my hungry complex is what you eat
I pray that for moments you will only be consumed by me
Often times we receive and then regret
I haven't had a reason yet
This is the time God meant for us to be (night now)
This is the place he allowed us to me meet (right here)
I may never get another chance
I just hope you understand that at this time

At this time
In this place, you are mine
And at this moment
In my life
You belong to me
Oh, to me...
At this time
And in this place
You are mine
And this moment
In my life you belong to me
Oh, one more time... sing it

At this time
And in this place
You are mine
And this moment
In my life you belong to me

Who really cares what others may say
Probably missed a chance on feeling this way
About love what I know is true
Give 'em time and it can happen with them too
The deepest feeling that you've ever known
The greatest passion that's ever been shown
A flame that flickers and never leaves you alone
The weirdest place, oh yes, I call it my home

At this time
And in this place
You are mine
And this moment
