I guess I should have held you longer then I did
Then I could have been the girl you chose to spend the rest of your life with
Well, I could have came home instead of chasing my dreams
It was never about the money baby, I wanted you to be proud of me
When you tried to sweep me off my feet
I ran because I didn't understand why me
When I tried to run back to you
You had found somebody new, oh

Well, I guess I'm always too late
But just in time for
For another heartache, yeah
But whenever I'm early, you see
Love's never ready
But another heartache's waiting on me

I guess I should have kissed you in front of everyone that day
That could have been the moment you changed your mind and decided to stay, baby
Well I guess I could have learned to follow your lead
That wouldn't make much sense, you never believed in me
When I tried to give you all of me
You looked at me and said there's no need for trying
I guess I should get over you
You said that's probably what you need to do, oh
You might also like
Well, I guess I'm always too late
But just in time for
For another heartache, yeah
But whenever I'm early, you see
Love's never ready
But another heartache's waiting on me

Love is unavailable when I'm knocking at his door
Shows up unannounced when I'm healing from hurt before
Oh, it's beautiful along the way
In the beginning you were so kind
It was never love at all it was heartache in disguise
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Well, I guess I'm always too late
But just in time for
For another heartache, oh-woah
But whenever I'm early, you see
Love's never ready
