She said, "fine, how you been, I slept alright"
He said, "I've been wanted to talk to you, I got a bit of news"
She said, "sure, why you crying, what's wrong with you!"
He said, "I got a baby on the way, I'm sorry"
She said nothing for awhile, she said nothing
He said, "baby, please respond, I feel so bad about what I've done"
She said, "why did you do this to me, huh?"
He said, "I made a mistake and slipped up
Please don't hate me 'cause I messed up"
She said, "I don't hate you, I just hate that you have to choose"
She continues, "now what are you gonna do, I will help you raise the child
If you sever your ties, if you want me in your life"
Such a simple complication
It's a sad story 'cause they never knew
Oh, it hurts so just to hear this conversation
'Cause they really don't know what they need to do
He replied, "I got to be a man, and I got to handle responsibility"
She said, "why do you have to leave, you said you loved me"
He said, "do and I always will I'm just distraught on how to deal with
What I did and how you feel still, I'm about to be a daddy"
She said, "I know, and it's so beautiful but don't make a decision yet
And do something that you might regret, you don't have to get married to be a good daddy"
She said, "that's the only way that I know"

Oh, it hurts so just to hear this conversation
'Cause they really don't know what they need to do
Sometimes there are predicaments
That we aren't meant
To solve on our own alone we have
The right conversation with the wrong
Person never thinking to ask the one
Who has the answers to it all
Such a simple complication
It's a sad story 'cause they never knew
Oh, it hurts so just to hear this conversation
