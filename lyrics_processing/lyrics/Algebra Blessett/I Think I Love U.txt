(I got something to tell you)
We've been friends for quite some time and now I see you
Differently there's a cloudy picture
That's becoming clearer to me
I hesitate to tell
You feel
Because I don't want you to be afraid
And I don't want to make the mistake
Of being too shy to say

I think I love you
And I don't ever want to let you go
I think I need you
In ways that I am unable to show
I think love you and I want everybody that we know
To know just how you make me feel
Just how you make me feel

If you make it so frustrating because you're so spoiled like me
And it drives me insane when we agree to disagree
When my words don't move together to make much sense
You recite the perfect sentence to put my mind at ease
You might also like
See, I think I love you, I love you
And I don't ever want to let you go
I think I need you
In ways that I am unable to show
I think I love you
And I want everybody that we know
To know just how you make me feel
Just how you make me feel
Just how you make me feel

Time and time again I'm trying to convince to myself
That what I feel it does make sense
To me sometimes
It's difficult to me
Like when days are here to stay
And you're bringing me my smile
But when tomorrow comes around
And somehow you let me down, it's confusing
Baby, you're driving me crazy

I think I love you, I love you
And I don't ever want to let you go
I think I need you
In ways that I am unable to show
I think I love you
And I want everybody that we know
To know how you make me feel
Just you make me feel
(I think) I think I love you
And I want everybody to know
I think, I think, I think I need you
In ways that I'm unable to show
I think, I think I love you
This is how you make, how you make me feel
How you make, how you make me feel, oh
I think, I think I love you, baby
I think I need you, oh
