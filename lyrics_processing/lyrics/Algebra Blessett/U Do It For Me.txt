Oooh
Got me day dreamin' thinkin' 'bout rings and
Got me day dreamin'...
Ah
Got me day dreamin' thinking 'bout rings and
Got me day dreamin'...

Here I go waking up, yawning, 6 in the morning
With you on my mind
I'm laying in bed scarf still on my head
Barely got the cold out my eyes
Reflecting... 'bout the conversation we had last night
And I'm reminded of why
I do the things I do just for you, for you
I don't have to think twice

I do it 'cause he real with me
I do 'cause he still with me
I do 'cause I should
I do 'cause you're good for me, good for me
I do it 'cause I trust (ya)
I do it 'cause I must
And I'm doin' it for us
I do it 'cause I'm grateful... willing and able
I do it for you 'cause you do it for me

Got me day dreamin'
Thinking 'bout things and switchin' up my whole life style
I call you on the phone on my way home
Treating you is on my mind
I'll be cutting up greens, makin' pinto beans
I know you like rice and gravy
Be at my door before eight you bring the cake
Babe, tonight will be fine...

I do it 'cause he real with me
I do 'cause he still with me
I do 'cause I should
I do 'cause you're good for me, good for me
I do it 'cause I trust (ya)
I do it 'cause I must
And I'm doin' it for us
I do it 'cause I'm grateful... willing and able
I do it for you 'cause you do it for me

U make it so easy for me
And I wanna do the same for you
U are simply perfect for me
And I must say sincerely
Everything I do, I do it for you

Oooh
Got me day dreamin' thinkin' 'bout rings and
Got me day dreamin'...
Aaahhh
Got me day dreamin' thinkin' 'bout rings and
Got me daydreaming...

I do it 'cause he real with me
I do 'cause he still with me
I do 'cause I should
I do 'cause you're good for me, good for me
I do it 'cause I trust (ya)
I do it 'cause I must
And I'm doin' it for us
I do it 'cause I'm grateful... willing and able
