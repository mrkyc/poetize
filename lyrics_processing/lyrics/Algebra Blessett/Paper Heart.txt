Paper heart...

Baby, ball me up and shoot for three
If you make the shot, say you'll come back for me
When you cut me into little pieces
Promise you'll put me back together again, oh

Why do you build me up to bring me down
Only when you're lonely, you come around

And I became your paper heart
To get scribbled on, ripped and torn from your love
Don't wanna be your paper heart
It's more than I can handle, I'm fragile
So take care of my paper heart

Unfold me from this imagery
When you're chasing after memories of me
You keep me tucked away til it's time
To pretend you love me when it's all a lie, all a lie, why
You might also like
Why do you build me up to bring me down
Only when you're lonely, you come around

And I became your paper heart
To get scribbled on, ripped and torn from your love
Don't wanna be your paper heart
It's more than I can handle, I'm fragile
So take care of my paper heart

Paper hearts can get burned
And thrown away when it's their turn
What's true to you is not for them
Hold your heart until it's real

And I became your paper heart
To get scribbled on, ripped and torn from your love
Don't wanna be your paper heart
It's more than I can handle, I'm fragile
So take care of my paper heart

Paper hearts can get burned
And thrown away when it's their turn
What's true to you is not for them
Hold your heart until it's real
Paper hearts do get burned
Thrown away when it's their turn
True to you is not for them
So you better listen to your (paper heart)
Ball me up and shoot for three
If you make the shot, say you will come back for me
