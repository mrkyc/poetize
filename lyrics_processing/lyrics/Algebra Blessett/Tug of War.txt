You're so happy when I'm around
Then you change your mind and look at me
Like I let you down
You used to return phone calls
Visited me often
Something's changed, it's not the same
I just don't know
Now I don't understand you
Why you do the things you do
I never know
Been through this a time or two
Don't wanna feel like this no more
If I ask a question
You ask the same question
Why don't you answer
Instead of all this back and forth
Here we go again
Both of us pullin'
In different directions
In a game of tug of war
Why you keep fightin'
So hard to be right when
It doesn't matter
Tell me what we fightin' for
You 'bout to lose me
And I'm goin' be lonely so why do we both keep
Pullin' in this tug of war
You might also likeHoldin' on to you
Is like I'm gambling my heart
If I let go
I will fall
Hard
I'll hurt myself, ooh
Never forget who
Let go of me
And never said I'm sorry, boo
Now I don't understand you
Why you do the things you do
I never know
Been through this a time or two
Don't wanna feel like this no more
If I ask a question
You ask the same question
Why don't you answer
Instead of all this back and forth
Here we go again
Both of us pullin'
In different directions
In a game of tug of war
Why you keep fightin'
So hard to be right when
It doesn't matter
Tell me what we fightin' for
You 'bout to lose me
And I'm gone be lonely so why do we both keep
Pullin' in this tug of war
Let's hold on or move on together
Do what it takes to make it better
If you keep one end I will give in
Or we let go then we both win
If I ask a question
You ask the same question
Why don't you answer
Instead of all this back and forth
Here we go again
Both of us pullin'
In different directions
In a game of tug of war
Why you keep fightin'
So hard to be right when
It doesn't matter
Tell me what we fightin' for
You 'bout to lose me
And I'm gone be lonely so why do we both keep
