I'm just a young nigga trying to get paid
These days on a whole new wave
Why the man want me working like a slave (It's a check)
Quit my job wasn't happy with the wage
Young nigga hoppin' out the whip
Going dumb since 06'
I'm not that nigga who wants your money and your time
I be that nigga that's wants your soul and your mind
10 Visa's going straight to my bitches and they gone flip it
Blue bank rolls
You would think I was crippin'
But I'ma young Oakland nigga
We don't do that here
I keep it player year round in these dirty vans, bitch
Blue Hundreds
I'd die for new money
Same nigga's tryin' break bread be too crumby
Know I'm Scam Chappelle but my funds not funny
Got the Bernie Mac on my lap just in case you looking for me
Shake something
Pay something
Roll something
Pull your titties out right now both of 'em
You know i got blue hundreds in my pocket
So I don't want nothing from you
Girl, I got it
You might also like
They don't want to see me shine like that
They don't want to see me grind like that
Spend it all then get mine right back
I'm just trying to get my mind right back
VVS dancing on me
VVS dance like N Sync
VVS dancing on me
VVS dance like N Sync

I'm in a four door jeep with the top down
Reflecting on incidents that had me knocked down
Hot boy really shut the block down
But the game so cold like Moscow
I been struggling with my own addictions
I been battling with vixens
I'm addicted to these bitches
I been battling the bottle, I'm addicted to that Henny
I'm in love with the flex
Still In love with my ex but that bitch a hoe
I'm a hoe to so you know
I can't judge nobody, no
I had to get that money out of state, aye
Riding foreign on the golden gate, aye
Running to the money catch a nigga pace, wait
Spray a nigga like mace
Was involved in big fraud just to glow like this
If you can't respect my mind you a hoe you a bitch cause'
They don't want to see me shine like that
They don't want to see me grind like that
Spend it all then get mine right back
I'm just trying to get my mind right back
VVS dancing on me
VVS dance like N Sync
VVS dancing on me
