It's a check

Bounce out balling on everything
And I'm sipping on anything
You know the Feds want to get me
I ain't really paying for nothing
When they see me field you know that's it's all love yeah
Its all love yeah aye check
It's all love baby aye check

I got mud with me
I got my cuz' with me
And I'm fuckin' on her friend and she like, oo bitch you brought the plug with you
I scam for the cabin
Some where in Utah
You know it blanketed in snow everywhere we go
Gotta bring the Yeezy boots out
My cousin momma in shelter and it hurt me
My lil' brother moved out and it hurt me
My ex bitch broke my heart it awoke something
My granny got that fucking cancer and it broke something
My daddy in and out of jail and he 30
It's nigga's right across the street who wanna murk me and I'm damn
Why they wanna stick me for my bands?
Shit, it's a check right

Young bulls trippin', niggas hoppin' out on sight
Intuition telling me that nothing's going well

Cause If I can't make money money money yeah
Nigga, I'ma take money money take money money
