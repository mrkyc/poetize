It's a check
40 on my hip
Because I look like a lick
I'm not really acting out
They just never understand my lifestyle
Blue hunnits somebody let em know I'm coming
I'm going dumb in the field to get that money
Ain't nothing for too expensive I can stamp for it
I know you've been hunting for a scam boy

I want a big ass chain
Big tits on my lady
She don't let me fuck
I'ma big ass baby
Got big ass frames
Can't see my peripheral
But I got my niggas on my side
That stay in position
I stay on a mission
Tom cruise on these bitches
I ruin accounts
I empty amounts
I never run from you niggas
I'm never scared, I'm bone crushing you nigga's
But I'm not a killer nigga
In the hotel watch Akira with her
I had to make me a card
Girl, I'm the man at the bar
We gotta scam for a rental
We gotta get us a car
Rub on that thang till its hard
I'm on my way, that's not hard
I'm on my way, that's not hard is it?
Trying to spend 3 stack wit ya
The return of the mack nigga

40 on my hip
Because I look like a lick
I'm not really acting out
They just never understand my lifestyle
Blue hunnit's somebody let em know I'm coming
I'm going dumb in the field to get that money
Ain't nothing for expensive I can stamp for it
I know you've been hunting for a scam boy
Blue hunnit's somebody let em know I'm coming
I'm going dumb in the field to get that money
Ain't nothing for expensive I can stamp for it
I know you've been hunting for a scam boy

I just be stressing
I had to make all my blessings
Really they wasn't blessings
They was L's that i made lessons
I got a chip on my shoulder, the preface
I made some promises to all of my brethren
When I'm inside you I feel
Like that's where i need to be, woah
How you gone give up this Nyquil
To nigga's who already sleep, no
I need that bomb that C4
Feel like Delorean wing doors
I'm going up
So spit on the dick til you throwin' up
You know I scam for the Uber truck
I pulled up with Henny she know what's up
Big Ass Baby, cold grouch
If I don't get my way
Then it's going south
I'm just tryin' ball like a bigboy, Outkast with you
Tryin' spend 3 stacks with you
The return of the mack nigga
40 on my hip
Because I look like a lick
I'm not really acting out
They just never understand my lifestyle
Blue hunnit's somebody let em know I'm coming
I'm going dumb in the field to get that money
Ain't nothing for expensive I can stamp for it
