II see the sweat down pourin'
An' I'm dyin' to drink
Every drop, every shot
Fallin' from you
You been a real bad girl
Ya need to go to my room
I love the way that you is
I love the way that you are
How you shake your booty
When you dance on the bar
Love the way you look at me
Like I'm the only thing in your life
I love the way that you is
And I love the way that you are mine
What you say later
We go out to the lake
An' we can reminisce
Skinny dip our first date
Pickin' up, n' lickin' up
Where we left off
Under the water blanket covers
Where we're bobbin' for us, oh
I love the way that you is
I love the way that you are
How you shake your booty
When you dance on the bar
Love the way you look at me
Like I'm the only thing in your life
I love the way that you is
And I love the way that you are mine
I love the way that you is
I love the way that you are
The way you shake your booty
When you dance on the bar
I love the way that you is
I love the way that you are
The way you shake your booty
When you dance on the bar
I love the way that you is
I love the way that you are
How you shake your booty
When you dance on the bar
Love the way you look at me
Like I'm the only thing in your life
I love the way that you is
An' I love the way that you are mine
I love the way that you is
An' I love the way that you are mine
I love the way that you is
