We want it louder...
The campus freight train
Is rollin' in today
It's full of bubba's and beers
And girls in high gear
We brought the trailer park
Gonna tear this place apart
Damn right we're tight
An' out after dark
So turn it up n' up n' up
We want it louder
Up n' up n' up
Turn it up n' up n' up
We want it louder
Up n' up n' up
We're gonna get the music rockin'
Gonna get the bodies jumpin'
Wanna get the party pumpin' 'round here
We're gonna get the walls shakin'
With the noise we will be makin'
Gonna get the party pumpin' e`round here
Sayin' hey hey cheers!
We fear no beer!
To all my brothers, sisters in here
We say hey hey cheers!
Hey hey cheers!
Now that the place is jammed
We're multi-taskin' man
With booze in one, and booty in the other hand
And a little somethin' else
That's what it's all about
If you remember dear
Then you weren't there
We done got-ah-got throwed out
Turn it up n' up n' up
We want it louder
Up n' up n' up
Turn it up n' up n' up
We want it louder
Up n' up n' up
We're gonna get the music rockin'
Gonna get the bodies jumpin'
Wanna get the party pumpin' 'round here
We're gonna get the walls shakin'
With the noise we will be makin'
Gonna get the party pumpin' 'round here
Sayin' hey hey cheers!
We fear no beer!
To all my brothers, sisters in here
We say hey hey cheers!
Here's to you an' here's to me
An' everything we'll ever be
'Cause nothing easy's ever free
But hypocrites & their disease
Pick your poison raise it high
We don't judge if you don't mind
What happens here lets make it clear
Hey hey cheers...
Up n' up n' up
Up n up n up
Turn it up n up n up
Up n up n up
We're gonna get the music rockin'
Gonna get the bodies jumpin'
Wanna get the party pumpin' 'round here
We'll get the walls shakin'
With the noise we will be makin'
Wanna get the party pumpin' 'round here
We're gonna get the music rockin'
Gonna get the bodies jumpin'
Wanna get the party pumpin' 'round here
We'll get the walls shakin'
With the noise we will be makin'
Wanna get the party pumpin' 'round here
Sayin' hey hey cheers!
We fear no beer!
To all my brothers, sisters in here
We say...
