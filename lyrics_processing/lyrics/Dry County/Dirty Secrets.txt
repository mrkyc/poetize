Bein' here alone with me
I cannot start a fireIf you bring the gasoline
I know you're into stealin'
This Adam from his Eve
And I ain't gonna lie about it
That fruit looks good to me
You'll keep these dirty secrets
If I feed them hungry eyes
Hey you won't say a word
And I'm great at tellin' lies
It's not that walls don't talk
I already know
I've got a million reasons to stay
I just need one to go home
I just need one to go home
Well I know you've heard them stories
Of how I used to be
How God was always testin'
And I got my share of D's
You're like that shot a' whiskey
That just keeps callin' me
An it's getting hot in here
And I sure could use a drink
You'll keep these dirty secrets
If I feed them hungry eyes
Hey you won't say a word
And I'm great at tellin' lies
It's not that walls don't talk
I already know
I got a million reasons to stay
I just need one to go home
I just need one to go home
You'll keep these dirty secrets
If I feed them hungry eyes
Hey you won't say a word
And I'm great at tellin' lies
It's not that walls don't talk
I already know
I got a million reasons to stay
I just need one to go home
You'll keep these dirty secrets
If I feed them hungry eyes
Hey you won't say a word
And I'm great at tellin' lies
It's not that walls don't talk
I already know
I got a million reasons to stay
I just need one to go home (you keep them dirty secrets)
I just need one to go home (you keep them dirty secrets)
I just need one to go home (you keep them dirty secrets)
I just need one to go home
I know just what you're thinkin'
Bein' here alone with me
S'all right I'm home now baby
