Maybe a little bit out of my mind
Why do I gotta set my sights on you
I know your situation
I feel your desperation
And I hear that crap of an excuse
I hear you cryin cause your alone every day
But you won't' listen when you hear me say
I'd take you Plain Jane any day
I don't care anyway
Good days bad ways
Tell me that you're gonna stay
By my side for the rest of my life
Ill take those good times bad times
Even all the little lies
Brake me in till it's love in your eyes
Ill take everything you've got
Straight up on the rox
I know you've got yourself a few of them boyfriends
And they always be messin around
And you wind up screamin 'what's the use'
Then you got them just friend buddy's
Pick you up when you feel a bit down
And they always come try and make a move on you

Plain Jane any day
I don't care anyway
Good days bad ways

By my side for the rest of my life
Ill take those good times bad times

Ill take everything you've got straight up
I can pick u up when your way down
I can put a smile on that frown
I'd change your everything
If you'll keep me hanging on
One of these days you'll say 'where you've been all my life?'
And I'll be sayin 'I've been right here waitin to take you'
Plain Jane any day
I don't care anyway
Good days bad ways
Tell me that you're gonna stay
By my side for the rest of my life
Ill take those good times bad times
Even all the little lies
Brake me in till it's love in your eyes
Ill take everything you've got
Straight up on the rox
