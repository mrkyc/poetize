Fifteen the week is through
A soul back six-pack
On my mind
Gas ball round up
Crammin' into one truck
Headin' on out
We gonna get a little rowdy
My oh my
I'm goin' goin' gone
My oh my
Look out here we come...
It's a big bone
It's a hick song
It's a little white trash
Cheech & Chong
It's a love thing
It's an us thing
It's a little bit of John Wayne
Showin' off the bling
Where ever there's a party goin' on
They'll be turnin' up a redneck song
I got a pocket full of homegrown
Movin' through the front row
Where I been, yet again
Quick as I can cash the cheque
12 pack half snap
Lookin for a slow dance
Another round, fall down
What happened to the weekend?
My oh my
I'm goin' goin' gone
My oh my
Look out here we come...
It's a big bone
It's a hick song
It's a little white trash
Cheech & Chong
It's a love thing
It's an us thing
It's a little bit of John Wayne
Showin' off the bling
Where ever there's a party goin' on
They'll be turnin' up a redneck song
My oh my oh my
My oh my oh my
My oh my oh my (goin' goin' gone...)
My oh my oh
Show us where you're from
It's a big bone
It's a hick song
It's a little white trash
Cheech & Chong
It's a love thing
It's an us thing
It's a little bit of John Wayne
Showin' off the bling
It's a big bone
It's a hank song
It's a yeehaw git-r-done
Cowboy up
It's a big bone
Hit song
Your song
My song
Any little reason to tie one on
Where ever there's a party goin' on
They 'll be turnin' up a redneck song
Turnin' up a redneck song
Turnin' up a redneck song
Turnin' up a redneck song
