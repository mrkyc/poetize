She gave me
A bunch of nasty little looks
She called me every dirty word that's in the book
She says you
Just wanna party every night
I think it's time you get a feel for what it's like
She said you don't know what your in for
You tonight, she says you're gonna get yours
Now she's drinkin till she's pretty in a party in the streets
She's on a mission and its going to extremes
A wild side of her I didn't wanna see
Cause she's drinkin till she's pretty
Much forgot about me
Well I knew
She was good upon her threat
She smiled at me and wrapped her arms around my friend
She says 'don't you worry baby, just forget about him'
She waved to me with that sadistic little grin
And says you don't know what your in for
You tonight, she says you're gonna get yours
Now she's drinkin till she's pretty in a party in the streets
She's on a mission and its going to extremes
A wild side of her I didn't wanna see
Cause she's drinkin till she's pretty
Much forgot about me

Now she's drinkin till shes pretty in a party in the streets
