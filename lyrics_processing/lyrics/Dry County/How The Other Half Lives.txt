Ditching long neck bottles
Pinching every dollar to say
'Hey baby let's sail away'
A thousand hours in the overtime
I'm breaking this worn out back of mine
But I can't wait to see
My baby's face when I say
Well I've gave all I gots to give
And now I'm sick
Of being sick and tired of this
So I think it's time that you and I
See how the other half lives
And you and I will be
One shot, pit stop from sailing away
And living that working class dream
White sands, dark tan
The love of my life with a drink
In both her beautiful hands
And telling me dear
If heaven were an Island
The Angels woulda made it right here
I'm Double fistin' in the Island sun
Relax kickin' back
Chillin' with the woman I love
Livin' what we been missin' for years
It's hotter at the Equator Line
I'm sweatin' out the mundane work train
Pullin' my life
And just lovin' it here
I think I'm ready for another round and
Maybe later lets renew the vows
'Cause some times we take for granted
All the things that we love
And you and I will be
One shot, pit stop from sailing away
And living that working class dream
White sands, dark tan
The love of my life with a drink
In both her beautiful hands
And telling me dear
Oh if heaven were an Island
The Angels woulda made it right here
They woulda made it right here
They woulda made it right here
So much better than I ever dreamed
And I don't think I wanna ever leave
So pour me a shot
For my baby and me
And her and I will be
One shot, pit stop from sailing away
And living that working class dream
White sands, dark tan
The love of my life with a drink
In both her beautiful hands
And telling me dear
Oh if heaven were an Island
The Angels woulda made it right here
This paradise we're livin'
Makes me think about all
We been missin here
Oh dear
(They woulda made it right here)
This paradise we're livin'
Makes me think about all
We been missin here
Oh dear
(They woulda made it right here)
Yeah whoa
Yeah
(They woulda made it right here)
Yeah whoa
Yeah
(They woulda made it right here)
Yeah whoa
