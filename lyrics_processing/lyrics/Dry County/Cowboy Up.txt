Welcome y'all to party 101
So you think you got jam?
You wanna be the man?
Step right up & come an' get you some
Well the first thing that yer gonna find out
It ain't the balls or the biggest mouth
Who holds their buzz & stand's up on their own
'Cause it ain't no race
There's no first place
And the point of it all is stand up tall
Show 'em your drinkin' bone
Heehaw git r' done
Last to fall is the last one drunk
Knock around but don't spill your glass
Keep it down, suck it up
Ain't no such thing as ah-way too much
All beginners get up off your ass...
And cowboy up!
You wanna shake that junk? (oh yeah...)
That's the stuff
Lick her up, down it, taste the burn
With a little bit of luck
We just might fall in love
An leave this place with someone on our arm
Take a chance on a one-night stand
Wearin' nothin' but our cowboy hat
It's only dirty if we does it right
So you an' me an' a friend make three
That's one for you another two for me
Money down & tearin' it up tonight!
Heehaw git r' done
Last to fall is the last one drunk
Knock around but don't spill your glass
Keep it down, suck it up
Ain't no such thing as ah-way too much
All beginners get up off your ass...
And cowboy up!
Heehaw git r' done
Last to fall is the last one drunk
Knock around but don't spill your glass
Keep it down, suck it up
Ain't no such thing as ah-way too much
All beginners get up off your ass...
And cowboy up!
Well heehaw git r' done
Last to fall is the last one drunk
Knock around but never spill your glass
Keep it down, suck it up
Ain't no such thing as ah-way too much
All beginners get up off your ass...
And cowboy up!
Heehaw git r' done
Last to fall is the last one drunk
Knock around but never spill your glass!
Keep it down, suck it up
Ain't no such thing as ah-way too much
All beginners get up off your ass...
