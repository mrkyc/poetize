Think I felt a little emotion
When you said good-bye
And you kissed my hand
Go ahead and speak your mind
Open up a little
To me one time
And I think you'll find
That I understand
Hey I know we had a deal
No emotions
No for reals
You make me
Wanna say this one more time:
I might be a little bit crazy
I might be a little bit gone
You might be a little bit afraid
Of me
And I might be a little bit lonely
I might be a little bit stoned
But I think I'm every little bit
You need
Every little bit you need
You might also likeAlright if we're gonna go through this
Set the rules promise
Not to promise
With no forevers
With a whole lot of
For tonights
Gettin' by I'm goin'
Ass backwards
Worry 'bout the
Little things afterwards
Maybe doin' it wrong
We'll be gettin' it right
Hey I know
You feel your body's chokin'
Hey I'll show
Love you found
With a heart that's broken
I might be a little bit crazy
I might be a little bit gone
You might be a little bit afraid
Of me
And I might be a little bit lonely
I might be a little bit stoned
But I think I'm every little bit
You need
Every little bit you need
Every little bit you need
But if you ever think
You're losin' your mind
Holdin' me..
You might be a little bit crazy
You might be a little bit wrong
Maybe you're just fallin'
In love with me
And I might be a little bit lonely
I might be a little bit stoned
Lets wait and see what
Tomorrow brings
'Cause I might be a little bit crazy
I might be a little bit gone
You might be a little bit afraid
Of me
I might be a little bit lonely
I might be a lot of bit stoned
I think I'm every little bit
You need
Every little bit you need
I'm every little bit you need
I'm every little bit you need
