N' women who somehow lost their tops
They ain't gonna see me anymore
'Cause I just heard your plane
Touched down
I'm on the Freeway outta town
You've got me haulin' ass
For a piece of yours
I know it's been a while
Since you left me for Ohio
Gone and done the things
You had to live
And I don't care
Hey where you been
Or anything you gone and did
I just can't wait
To feel your skin again
Damn ow, here we go
Jump back up in that rodeo
I hope you double stitched them seams
Climb on up in them cut off jeans
Damn ow, girl you know
We ain't never ever gonna make it home
'Cause once I get you off that plane
You're climbin' on a Hillbilly train
So let's jump aboard these well known doors
See what this track has in store
N' ride the rails that've taken us this far
Chug-a-luggin' chuggin' beer
Checkin' out the view from here
Knowin' where we're goin'
After missin' all yer lovin'
Makes me wanna stop the car
But it's so damn hard
So instead of over thinkin'
I say we get to drinkin'
Let's lose the painful memory
At every stop
Let's not worry about tomorrow
If yesterday's on auto
Anywhere but here is worth a shot
Damn ow, here we go
Jump back up in that rodeo
I hope you double stitched them seams
Climb on up in them cut off jeans
Damn ow, girl you know
We ain't never ever gonna make it home
'Cause once I get you off that plane
You're climbin' on a Hillbilly train
Damn ow, here we go
Damn ow, girl ya know
Damn ow, here we go
Jump back up in that rodeo
I hope you double stitched them seams
Climb on up in them cut off jeans
Damn ow, girl you know
We ain't never ever gonna make it home
'Cause once I get you off that plane
You're climbin' on a Hillbilly
Damn ow, here we go
Jump back up in that rodeo
I hope you double stitched them seams
Climb on up in them cut off jeans
Damn ow, girl you know
We ain't never ever gonna make it home
'Cause once I get you off that plane
My little missin' trailer princess
