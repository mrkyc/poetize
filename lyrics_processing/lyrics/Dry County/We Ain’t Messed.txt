But we ain't messed
Hey baby tell me what yer thinkin'
Let me know that I'm not alone tonight
In the way I feel
I can see it in your eyes
This has come as a big surprise
An' I love the way you look at me tonight
But it's getting harder now
To misplace the love I've found
Honey lose your halo
I won't let you down
Oh baby
Well I didn't get this way
Worrin' about tomorrow's pain
I'm swingin' for the fences baby
Girl I can't miss
And I know it's problematic
But I just gotta have it
This heart of mine
Hammerin' harder out through my chest
This may be crazy baby
But we ain't messed
Well I swore there would never be another
Close enough to hear "I love her"
But I guess you shot that theory
All to hell
10 days til you get back
Let me tell you baby after that
It isn't gonna be too hard
To sell
Hey angel what you say
We go to a hotter place
Honey lose your halo
I'm gonna blow your mind away
I didn't get this way
Worrin' about tomorrow's pain
I'm swingin' for the fences baby
Girl I can't miss
And I know it's problematic
But I just gotta have it
This heart of mine
Hammerin' harder out through my chest
This may be crazy baby
But we ain't messed
Oh it's gettin' harder now
To misplace the love I've found
Honey lose your halo
I won't let you down
Oh baby
I didn't get this way
Worrin' about tomorrow's pain
I'm swingin' for the fences baby
Girl I can't miss
And I know it's problematic
But I just gotta have it
This heart of mine
Hammerin' harder out through my chest
This may be crazy baby
This may be crazy baby
This may be crazy baby
But we ain't messed
No we ain't messed
No we ain't messed
