Somethin' different in a place that never allows a change
 steel blue eyes, with every breath she was taking mine
I think she only let me hold her 'cause I never tried to make her stay
When your young in love fire is hard to know
What hurts worse, holdin' on or lettin' go?
And some things are born to be free
And love a man headin' for the very same thing
It's a beauty almost spiritual to watch her run
And I knew she'd never stay mine
'Cause you can't lay claim to somethin' so wild
Just enjoy 'em while you can 'cause they don't stick around
Not a mustang in a pony town
There were cold nights I felt the heat
Sometimes I could feel the burn in me
I told her that I loved her
She said "Just for a while"
I can say my heart was deceivin' me
I knew from the start where it would be
Only a fool would fall in love with a leavin' smile
And some things are born to be free
And love a man headin' for the very same thing
It's a beauty almost spiritual to watch 'em run
And I knew she'd never stay mine
'Cause you can't lay claim to somethin' so wild
Just enjoy 'em while you can 'cause they don't stick around
Not a mustang in a pony town
