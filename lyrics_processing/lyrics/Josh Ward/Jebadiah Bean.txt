He was covered in dust from many days
Of ridin' hard along the outlaw trail
No one knew where he come from
He had a Bible in his pocket, one or two guns
He said he's a prophet, I swear he's the devil himself
Well his name was Jebadiah Beane
His hands were quick and his wits were keen
His eyes were the color of cold blue steam
And his matchin' Colts were .44s
Said that they were given to him by the Lord
Just to save the women and send the rest to hell
Jebadiah Beane, you're a hard, hard man
You preach the gospel with a six-gun in your hand
Jebadiah Beane, what gives you the right
To gun down another man 'cause he don't see the light
Well it's said that he used to be a gamblin' man
But on the deck, the Mississippi queen got dealt him a new hand
Well a boom of lightnin' came down from a clear blue sky
When he opened his eyes, he said that he had finally seen the light
Well ever since then he's been a God fearin' man, a strong right arm of the Lord
He does God's biddin', he does God's reapin' for a sin you can't afford

To gun down another man 'cause he don't see the light
It's been six short weeks since he rolled into town
In six short weeks a six-gun and six men six feet in the ground
Jebadiah Beane, you're a hard, hard man
You preach the gospel with a six-gun in your hand
