You're looking like a new philosophy
Touch down, new queen, you're killing me
You're looking so independent
I'm craving what you're showing me
An emotional currency
You're looking so damn infectious
Chic, electric, ah!

Look at you just living like limelight
I could be your spotlight
Shining on your best side
Show me your bad side

You're so cute and you don't even know it
You're walking that talk and I love it, I love it
Show me how you do it oh, I want it! I want it!
I'll be your cheerleader

Your style is a cosmic getaway
Your smile is a national holiday
Ow! scratch off, you're a winning ticket

Put your hands up, high five, whip sound!

Look at you just living like limelight
