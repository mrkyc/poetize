Don't treat, don't treat me like

Why do they only hear me
When I say it so eloquently? Say it softly?
Who gets to tell me how I
Put clothes on, move in my, live in my body?
Who's gonna stop me?

I'm not your mother
And you don't get my permission
If you feel like I'm talking to you, then listen

Don't treat me like that (Don't treat, don't treat me like)
Don't treat me like that (Don't treat, don't treat me like)
I'm not a person on a pedestal stuck in your head
What version of me do you see deserving respect?
You don't treat, don't treat me like

Do you only listen to women
If you have the chance of seeing them naked?
If you like the way I look, would you listen to me closer?
Look closer

I'm not your mother
And you don't get my permission
If you feel like I'm talking to you, then listen

Don't treat me like that (Don't treat, don't treat me like)
Don't treat me like that (Don't treat, don't treat me like)
I'm not a person on a pedestal stuck in your head
What version of me do you see deserving respect?
You don't treat, don't treat me like that

(Don't treat, don't treat me like)
(Don't treat, don't treat me like)
(Don't treat, don't treat me like)
(Don't treat, don't treat me like)

I wanna walk alone when I go out tonight
Not clutching on my keys and scared I'm gonna die
Don't wanna over-analyze that dress I like
When I go out tonight, when I go out tonight

Don't treat me like that (Don't treat, don't treat me like)
Don't treat me like that (Don't treat, don't treat me like)
I'm not a person on a pedestal stuck in your head
What version of me do you see deserving respect?
You don't treat, don't treat me like that
(Don't treat, don't treat me like)
Don't treat me like that (Don't treat, don't treat me like)
Don't treat me like
Don't treat, don't treat me like
You don't treat, don't treat me like
