Never mind how I'm keeping
As of right now, I'm losing it as if I had it in the first place
Running water in the bathroom
It's 3 AM and I can't sleep, I don't even recognize me

Ooh paranoia
I can't avoid you

Say what you wanna, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before
Say what you wanna, oh, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before

Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

Let me at it, I'm tired of it pestering me
I can't get rid of it 'cause killing it's like pulling my own teeth
One, two, three, I stop, because it's bleeding
And I realise my nervous mind is stuck inside
You might also like
Ooh paranoia
I can't avoid you

Say what you wanna, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before
Say what you wanna, oh, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before

Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

There you go, you're saying I'll be fine but I won't
Brush it under the bed, another time but it won't stay down
You're crawling into my mind and out my mouth
I'm scared you're not mine and you want out

Say what you wanna, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before
Say what you wanna, oh, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before
Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
