I don't wanna break up
Can we just phase out?
A gradual transition
From the way things are right now
Things don't have to end bad
Trade weekends with the cat
We'll keep the apartment
And you can still play golf with my dad

We can still be friends
Or is that utopian?

We don't have to shine a bad light
Just because it's changing
It doesn't take away the good times
No one has to be the bad guy
Just 'cause it's not working
No, we don't have to shine a bad light

Know that I'm not salty, I want this to stay sweet
I just miss the people that we used to be
I want you to be happy and I want the same for me
I'm just tired of fixing what doesn't need fixing

We don't have to shine a bad light
Just because it's changing
It doesn't take away the good times
And no one has to be the bad guy
Just 'cause it's not working
No, we don't have to shine a bad light
No, we don't have to shine a bad light

We don't have to leave loud
Let's not burn the house down
We don't need a door slam to open a new one (Open a new one)
Let's open a new one (Open a new one)
Open a new one (Open a new one)
Let's open a new one

We don't have to shine a bad light
Just because it's changing
It doesn't take away the good times
And no one has to be the bad guy
Just 'cause it's not working
It doesn't mean that it won't hurt
It doesn't mean we didn't try
We don't have to shine a bad light
(We don't have to shine a bad light)
No, we don't have to shine a bad light
(We don't have to shine a bad light)
No, we don't have to shine a bad light
And we don't have to shine a bad light
We don't have to shine a bad light
(Doesn't mean that it won't hurt)
We don't have to shine a bad light
(Doesn't mean we didn't try)
