Yeah No no no
This ain't what it seems
Yeah time gone go
Fast as we blink
Yeah it's all fascinated
Till the see you laters
I'll be right here, right here
But until then
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'll be Gone, Gone, Gone
I'll be Gone
I'll be gone
I'll be Gone, Gone, Gone
I'll be Gone
(Verse 1) 
Yea You know, you know the beat and the sound
You know you know, I don't even wanna be around
With my face to the ground, calling on you when I'm down
Yea you know you know that I'm better off with you
I can't wait till the day that I'm/ gone
Yessir, you know that I'm attracted to the moment
What a terrible place to put a home in, boy you know that that's a fact ain't got to vote in/ can't wait till I'm gone
Why I gotta die to get some answers?
Feeling like I never even had a pastor
Boy you know that's an accurate example can't wait till I'm gone, Regretting every day I failed to mention
Your name when I prayed I always question
The validity of you up in the heavens
Can't wait till I'm gone, so the doubts can finally flee
All outside of me, I've been found and now I see
You might also like(Hook) 
Yeah No no no
This ain't what it seems
Yeah time gone go
Fast as we blink
Yeah it's all fascinated
Till the see you laters
I'll be right here, right here
But until then
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'll be Gone, Gone, Gone
I'll be Gone
I'll be gone
I'll be Gone, Gone, Gone
I'll be Gone

(Verse 2)
That's the battlefield
No matter where I travel He'll
Dismantle fear and handle real
Issues every time that I'll try and go and grab the wheel
I am for real, every thing I said up in the first verse
Cause I know for sure the earth's cursed
This the part of the song when I really try rap like
Whooop
I ain't gotta lie, this a mistake of a, Mrs. taking me for granted
Like a mixtape cover, your miss be taking shots, well that a mistake, my mistakes been covered by the one that you got mistaken brother can you tell me have you ever seen a Father fight for a child that really He love, well then you probably missed taken brother
Chasing the wind is only chasing to prove
If I ain't chasing to you then I'm chasing to lose
Now you understand why I'm praying to lose, this life, yea yea
(Hook) 
Yeah No no no
This ain't what it seems
Yeah time gone go
Fast as we blink
Yeah it's all fascinated
Till the see you laters
I'll be right here, right here
But until then
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'll be Gone, Gone, Gone
I'll be Gone
I'll be gone
I'll be Gone, Gone, Gone
