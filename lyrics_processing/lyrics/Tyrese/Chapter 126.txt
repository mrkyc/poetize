(hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...)
Yeah, I wanna dedicate this song
To Africa and 126, let's go
(oooooooooooooooh...)
I come to you humble and grateful
For my freedom
Not only freedom physically but freedom of the mind
And freedom of my Spirit
In Jesus name, Amen
Verse 1:
Don't leave me out cause I'm black
Don't leave me out cause I'm white
Leave me cause I'm treating you wrong
When I'm supposed to treat you right (ooh)
Don't leave me out in the cold
Treat me like I'm 12 years old
Visitor, I'm from Africa
And I can stand wherever I want (ooh)
I can see it so clearly
Soon as I stare in your eyes
Yeah you're making more money than me
That don't mean I'm not qualified
I wake up every morning (I wake up)
With a smile on my face (smilin')
Thanking the Lord for giving me
Another opportunity to feed my family, ooh aah
