Checking in when I knew I would be late
And how many times did invite you 'round
Knowing lately all in my face
So tell why you trippin' girl about all these different girls
Is that what you really think of me
When you got the most important piece of me, (piece of me)
I could be leaving but I'm not
I realize what I got, can't nobody take your spot
No matter how many places I go
I will always call you home
They ain't got nothing on you
I know we be fussin, think it's always something
But it's nothing on you
If I wanted her I'd get her
But you're so much better yeah
You ain't gotta be around
Baby for me to always hold you down
They ain't got nothing on you
Nothing nothing
They ain't got nothing on you
She might look like Hallie
But you always steal the scene
And I know you think that I'm not ready
To truly say that you are the one for me
It's nothing that I don't think about it
Girl I'm may look but I won't touch
I never put that shit on us
Will I ever leave, I doubt it
Baby you so stole my heart
So I can't go too far
