I can't get you off my mind
Thinking of you all the time

Just like a drug but better, baby I'm stuck on that
Can't get enough of our magic
Think I fell in love with that ounce
Hopin' that you call, going through withdrawal
When you stop dealing with me girl, it's like the sky falls
Ain't no use in going to rehab as I keep going back to what she had

Just one more hit baby
Gives me that feeling one more time

I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
Running in my veins, I can't leave you alone
I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
I know I gotta have you no matter what it costs
You might also like
Baby what have you done cause I'm fiending
Whatever it is baby I need it
I'm tryna be strong but can't wait
They say I'm lost in your love and I believe it
So when I need a fix, you be my connect
Go too long without it girl, it's like I'm a mess
Ain't no use in going to rehab
Cause I keep going back to what she had

Just one more hit baby
Gives me that feeling one more time

I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
Running in my veins, I can't leave you alone
I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
I know I gotta have you no matter what it costs

I've been tryna quit and quit and cold turkey
It don't matter what I do, it ain't working
Girl what you're doing got me strung out
Gon' have me tweaking if you run out
But clearly I got it back
Anytime I leave I come running back
Girl I'm losing control
Cause you're all in my soul
I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
Running in my veins, I can't leave you alone
I'm a addict, I'm a addict
Every piece of your body I gotta have it
I'm strung out, so far gone
I know I gotta have you no matter what it costs

I can't get you off my mind
Thinking of you all the time
I can't get you off my mind
