Yo, I wanna go there
And I think you're gonna like it
And when I get there just be ready

Sit back and relax let me do my thing
I'm about to go there for that old time swing
Anything you want, anything you desire
Babe, just let me know 'cause you light my fire, lady

I can tell that you want me tonight
All I came to do is make it right
Let's get sweaty in front of the fireplace
(It's on, bring it on 'cause I'm ready)

I wanna go there with you and do all the things no one would do
I wanna go where no one has been
I wanna go there with you
(I wanna go there with you)
(So I gotta go there)
I wanna go there with you and give you everything you need me to
I wanna go where no one has been
I wanna go there with you
(I wanna go there with you)
