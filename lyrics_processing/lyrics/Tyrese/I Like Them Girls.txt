I like them girls
I like them girls

Get a call from my crew this weekend
Talkin bout a party said it's gonna be crackin'
Since I'ma drive the Porsche, I tell 'em push the blue Benz
Cause when it's over straight parkin lot pimpin'
So once I find my keys to the ride
Hit the spot around 11:45
Cuz everybody knows that's when it gets hot
Tonight I'm gonna find a lil' shorty for a player to cop, yeah

I need a hot girl for me
A sexy lil' mommy
Knows how to turn me on
Freak me from the night to the early morn
A girl who knows just what she wants
If you see it baby don't front
Hair fly and nails done lookin' she got one
That's the kind I like
You might also like
I like them girls between the sheets
Like them girls iced up like me
I like them girls in the fly Gucci
Rollin deep in the 6, Cartier on the wrist
I like em thick
Small waist with the big ol' hips
I like them girls in the drop Bentley
That's the kind of girl I need

Out the corner of my eye spot a shorty
Ice so bright baby lightin' up the party
She got the Prada fitting right on her body
36-24 how could I let her pass me
I approached her with the game on tight
Said you's the kind of flavor I like
She said what's up with later tonight
Gonna do whatever feels right to you

I like them girls with the candy thighs
Kissable lips
And the big brown eyes
That's the kind of girl I need
I like them girls from around the way
Shortie got a record and it makes me say
Ohh ya ohh ya
That's the kind of girl I need
