I know I got some explainin' to do ohh, baby

Hey girl is it cool if I'm honest
Just hold on you know that it's hard for me
To say things things things that I promised
And do things that I never follow through

What kind of man's not there when you're cryin'
What kind of man don't care if he's lying
Now I understand who could be that kind of man
And that's me and I must be crazy

I must be crazy for not takin' care of you
And I must be crazy now I'm feelin' like a fool
'Cause you were my baby and I was yours too
It's startin' to break me 'cause now, baby, I see
You were right when you said I must be crazy yeah

You told me
We had a problem
Your girls said you deserve better than me
And they was right
I can't believe it
I gotta ask myself why

I should have known
That an understanding
Is what a woman needs
This time I'll get it right
I'll tell you every night
I can't live without you
This time is half my own
I'll tempt ya, babe
Doubt there right, that's what I got outta what I heard
Attempt to 'splain
Now I know what I'm supposed to do babe
All I need is a chance from you
Don't take this the wrong way, babe
I'm not trying to justify what I did
But now I just gotta ask you something now
What kind of woman would you be
If you didn't give a second chance to a man like me
And what kind of woman would you be
If you turned your back on me on my knees
'Cause I deserve a second chance
To be the one you call your man
I'm doin' everything I can
So, girl, don't you be crazy

I must be crazy for not takin' care of you
And I must be crazy now I'm feelin' like a fool
'Cause you were my baby and I was yours too
It's startin' to break me 'cause now, baby, I see
