Pimpin', it ain't easy for me
Especially, the way these chicks be checkin' for me
It's like all the time
And it's like everywhere
And it's like into the club
Honeys stop and stare, wait a minute
It's not my ego, y'all, that's just the way it is
Showbiz like no bis
I loved girls throughout my whole career
From stubborn chicks, to the cuties on the bus stop
Church girls, all the way up to the movie stars
I'm not trippin' when it comes down to the women
'Rese is down with all signs, boy let me tell you somethin'

These are the zodiac signs, that I wanna make love to
The zodiac signs that I wanna get next to
See I ain't trippin' when it comes down to these girls
We other-world, we other-world
These are the zodiac signs, that I wanna take shoppin'
The zodiac signs that I wanna take club hoppin'
See I ain't trippin' when it comes down to these girls
We other-world, we other-world

Let's get a hotel room
And have an after party (Oh yeah)
The show is over now it's time to freak somebody
So throw your hands up and represent your signs
Fellas, I don't know about you
But I'm about to make one of these honeys mine
Ladies, let me tell you all about the Capricorn
See, when it comes to sex it's guaranteed some babies will be born
See, I've got driven from listenin' to the twelve play
Aquarius, I tell you they can go from night 'til day
Kells, I ain't trippin', 'Rese loves them all kinds, yeah
They're all mines, all dimes, all fines, yeah
