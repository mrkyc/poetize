I'm sorry
I'm sorry, yes, I am, for everything that I've done

How can I do this right, with you in my life
Even though I say I love you
I've gotta make a change in my life, baby
I realize that you're better off without me by your side
You're a special lady and I know I'm not ready for you, oh

I'm sorry for what I've done
I broke your heart, now we're apart
I'm sorry for makin' you cry
I broke your heart, now I'm alone

I'm by myself
Tell me why, why I made my baby cry
I know I love you but why
Should I put you through all of these changes
Nevermind all those things I said 'cause I didn't mean a thing
I promise you, I only want you in my life, oh

I'm sorry for (I'm so sorry, babe), what I've done (everything I've done to you, oh)
I broke your heart, now we're apart (Now we're apart and I can't deal with it)
I'm sorry for (Oh, tell me anything), making you cry (I can do to get you back)
I broke your heart, now I'm alone
You might also like
Oh, it hurts to move on
'Cause you're all I knew
But I must stay strong
I can't break down no more
Sometimes I sit and dream of you and me again
Oh, you have no idea, oh, of how hurt I am that I ran away

(The one thing I said)
I'm sorry for (Meant the world to me, oh) what I've done
I broke your heart (I'm so hurt that I did my baby wrong)
Now we're apart
I'm sorry for (I'm so sorry now) makin' you cry (Oh, oh, ohh)
I broke your heart (How could I be), now I'm alone
I'm sorry for, what I've done
I broke your heart, now we're apart (Forever more)
I'm sorry for, making you cry (Making my baby cry, oh)
