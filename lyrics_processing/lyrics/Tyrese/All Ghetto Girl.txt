Can somebody tell me what's goin on?
I'm gettin' tired of fake, rich wannabes
Runnin' up my card, spendin' my money
Actin' all smart with no degrees
Don't like my friends 'cause you're too boujee, yeah

Never wanna go to an R&B/hip-hop show (Never wanna go to see hip-hop)
It's funny but I had more
Fun when I had no dough, I need a girl from the ghetto

I need an all ghetto girl, I need a bad mother with designer
Toes, tattoos and golds, straight up Ghetto
Don't matter if I ain't got no dough, she's gonna be my boo
Gonna be my crew, ohh, ghetto girl

I need a girl from BK, or the boogie down
Compton, Long Beach, or maybe Chi-Town
The ATL, or the Dirty South
She can be from Watts 'cause that's my part of town (Hey)

Never wanna go to an R&B/hip-hop show (She's acting up but it)
Funny but I had more fun when I had no dough
I need a girl from the ghetto

I need an all ghetto girl, I need a bad mother with designer

Don't matter if I ain't got no dough, she's gonna be my boo
Gonna be my crew, ohh

I need a girl named Lakeisha, Tonya, Tameka, Tawanda
Rasheeda, Ashonda, Shaneiqa, and Shawna
Karen, Pam, Tina, ooh yeah, Brenda, Kenya and Natalie
(Oh, Kenya, you do it for me)

Never wanna go to an R&B/hip-hop show (Never wanna go see hip-hop)
It's funny but I had more fun when I had no dough, I need a girl
From the ghetto (Oh, yes I do)
Baby

I need an all ghetto girl, I need a bad mother with designer
Toes, tattoos and golds, straight up Ghetto
Don't matter if I ain't got no dough, she's gonna be my boo
Gonna be my crew, oh, ohh

I was sitting up talking to this girl one day (Ghetto, ghetto)
And this is what she told me
She said, 'Tyrese it don't matter if you NBA, NFL or you sing'
You gotta buy me everything, and I told her back in response, 'When I met ya, you had a bucket'
Your 2 dollars is what ya stuck with
You're high maintenance, I'm not feelin' it, baby girl
Go on, gone up out of here with all that drama
She's gonna be my boo, gonna be my crew, oh, ghetto girl
I need a girl from the ghetto, I need an all ghetto girl
I can take you anywhere I go
I would like a ghetto girl
Don't matter if I ain't got no dough
Said it's all about my baby from the ghetto
I know this
La-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
I need an all ghetto girl
I said, "Yeah"
I said, "Yeah"
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't matter if I ain't got no dough
She's gonna be my boo, be my crew
