Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect

Baby you know I ain't perfect and I know that I don't deserve you
You love me with all my flaws, ain't worried 'bout my past at all
All of this trust girl we earned it, cause we've learned to look past the surface
So i'ma do the best i can, try to make you understand

They can't break us down, we've been through too much
You can't tell me we weren't meant to be
Baby I believe you were made for me
Give my life for us, cause I see

Baby what we got is picture perfect
And I'm so glad to be the one to call you mine
Baby what we got I know it's worth it
And I'd be happy long as you're right by my side, stay here baby

Darling you came at the right time, cause some people search for a life time
Hoping to find a love like yours, but I ain't gotta look no more
When they talk we don't listen, it ain't even worth our attention
Cause I keep doing the best I can to make sure that you understand
You might also like
They can't break us down, we've been through too much
You can't tell me we weren't meant to be
Baby I believe you were made for me
Give my life for us, cause I see

Baby what we got is picture perfect
And I'm so glad to be the one to call you mine
Baby what we got I know it's worth it
And I'd be happy long as you're right by my side, stay here baby

You know I need you, need your loving
You know I want you here right by my side
Come over here and get my loving
You are the one to make me feel alright
(So no matter what they tell us, let's make 'em jealous because)

Baby what we got is picture perfect
And I'm so glad to be the one to call you mine
Baby what we got I know it's worth it
And I'd be happy long as you're right by my side, stay here baby

Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
(It ain't been easy baby)
Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
(Still here baby)
Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
(Said I love you, and I need you baby)
Baby we're picture perfect, baby we're picture perfect
Cause we're picture perfect baby)
