Now as I look around
What do I see?
Everybody wants to try to get to know me, baby
Now it's my prerogative to do what I want to do
And I couldn't see myself, babe, with no one but you

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do

Now I see you just can't handle
Handle my lifestyle
You say I'm do damn crazy
You say I'm to damn wild
You gotta understand, this is just the way I live
Baby, what you see is exactly what you get
(Nobody but my, my baby)

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do
You might also like
I know the situation's shady
You have to understand, you know that I'm the man, babe
I feel ya bout to drive me crazy
You're actin' insecure when all I want is you, you, you, baby

Well, uh, you can take my word like in God We Trust
Baby girl, they only want me 'cause I'm on the bus
I don't want a crew, I just want you, solo
Stereotypes, I'm from Watts so I'm ghetto
No more games or drama
If you live by the nana you die by the nana
Nobody knows how far we'll go
But I do, I don't want nobody but you

I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
