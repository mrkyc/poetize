I've been waiting all day long just to have you here
Girl to let you know, to let you know just how I feel
Now as much as I love to hear your pretty voice
Tonight it just won't do

I need your love baby, every bit of your love
So, I won't quit, no, until you give me all of you

Girl I'm here, waiting on you
I'll be here, don't take too long cause
Girl I'm here, here waiting on you

Now any other time I might be alright just by myself
But what I got in mind tonight baby, ooh I sure do need your help
Now I appreciate all the phone calls and the texts, but right now it just won't do

I need your love baby, every bit of your love
I won't quit, baby if I gotta get on one knee and beg
I won't quit, 'til you give me all of you

Girl I'm here, I'll be patiently waiting
I'll be here, girl I'll be patiently waiting, right here
Girl I'm here, here waiting on you, aw baby
