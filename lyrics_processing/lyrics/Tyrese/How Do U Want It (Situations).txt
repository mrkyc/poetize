Yeah, I wanna know how you want it
Can you tell me?

We pulled up in a fifteen stretch limo
Once we gettin' in the club, we gon' scout solo
My boys say we gotta go upstairs
About fifty situations, and you're not up there
Teesha, Ranesha, Pamela, Renee
I'm the king of the night, I'm 'bout to have it my way
Girls lookin' good up in VIP
Low key gold diggers tryna roll with me

(I know) what we came here to do
Give me the number, I'll holla later on if it's cool
(And I know) what I wanna get into
Baby girl, I wanna sample you
Tell me how do you want it?

How do you want it
How do you feel
If you do the thing right
You could be one of my situations
That's for real
How do you want it
How do you feel
If you do things right
You could be one of my situations
That's for real

I can't believe what I see
Situation got a big bubble in them jeans
I see you sippin' on Crissy, 'bout to get pissy
Heading back to the hizzy with my izzy
Girl I like the way you shake your hips
I love it when you lick your lips
Talking in my niggas 'cause we sexy with cash
'cause a Bentley and a six is a thing of the past

(I know) what we came here to do
Give me the number, I'll holla later on if it's cool
(And I know) looking kinda right tonight
Then I'm hoping to get a hit tonight
Tell me how do you want it?

How do you want it
How do you feel
If you do things right
You could be one of my situations
That's for real

Yo, mama, do you want it?
Yo, mama you crucial
Your body rankin', can you imagine what I'm thinkin'
You been nominated 'cause you such a situation
Many situations you can get handcuffed and done drivin'
Tied up and cut, garage hit, whatchu know about it
'cause you look scrumptious, something the mic with a touch
Fly, I'll mess up your head a little
Ma, you critical, way back
Believe you broke your boy neck when you stepped in
In them tight shorts, you made the games begin
(It's all about ten)
But wait, listen, it ain't like that
Lil' mama you crucial and I'm just tryna get with that
But nah, I was thinkin', we could least hook up and trade numbers
And sexy lil' conversation with a nigga
Lil' mama, you crucial and I do something to ya
Let's connect and do what grownups like to do
Don't fight it boo, 'cause you too cute to act ugly
You should at least try to hug me
Or better yet love me
You make the situation bubbly
How do you want it

How do you want it
How do you feel
If you do the thing right
You could be one of my situations
That's for real
How do you want it
How do you feel
If you do the thing right
You could be one of my situations
That's for real
Tell me how you want it
Tell me if you need it
If you want it, girl I got it
We should get it started
Tell me
Hey, yeah
How do you want it baby
