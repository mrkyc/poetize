Made my mistakes
Honey, you made yours too
I can't erase all the shit we put each other through
We were supposed to be together
Through the good and the bad
But you folded under pressure
Left out love in the past
Did you ever love me
Or was it the things I did for you?
Gave you all of my heart
But I guess it wasn't enough for you, oh, no
I know it's give and take
And I gave all I can give
Said you would be there darlin'
And you turned around and you dipped

When things got rough you chose to run
I don't think you ever loved me
Not like you said you did (Ooh)
Wasted my time, you wouldn't try
I don't think you ever loved me
And that's why you quit

We made a promise to God
To love 'til the end of days
But just like that it's all gone away
As I sit here wonderin'
Blamin' myself for everything
I can't help but think why me, why me, why me?
Without any warning or explanation
You decided for the both of us
That you'd be better off without me
Baby, that's so fucked up
You might also like
When things got rough you chose to run
I don't think you ever loved me
Not like you said you did (Ooh)
Wasted my time, you wouldn't try
I don't think you ever loved me
And that's why you quit

To give all my yesterday's
How can you take our tomorrow
And throw them all away?
I'm all out of answers
But one thing is clear

When things got rough (Rough, and the half of it, baby) you chose to run (I've never tried to run)
I don't think you ever loved me (Yes, I loved you)
Not like you said you did (Yes, like I said I did)
Wasted my time (Wasted those time), you wouldn't try
I don't think you ever loved me (That's why I had to find, I had to separate)
And that's why you quit, ooh (Oh, oh)

You didn't love me like you said you did (It's in God's plans, it's in God's hands now)
No, no, no, no, no (No, no, no, no, oh)
There's no way (Do you still believe? Do you still believe?)
