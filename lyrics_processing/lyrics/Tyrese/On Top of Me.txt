This is for them love makers
Sit back and relax
And let me take you there

It's three o'clock in the mornin'
And there's only one thing to do
Girl, your body's crazy, layin' next to mine
I tried my best to keep my cool
But the temperature's steady risin'
'Cause I'm all alone with you
And your sexy ways are so inviting
Damn, I wanna give it to you

Baby come and take my hand (Oh, grab my hand because)
I just wanna freak you
(Girl, I got what you want, now its time for you to
Climb up on top of me)

Girl, I want you on top of me
I got what your body needs (I got what your body needs)
There's a vacancy in ecstasy and I'm gon' take you there
Girl, I want you on top of me (I want you on top of me)
I got what your body needs
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
