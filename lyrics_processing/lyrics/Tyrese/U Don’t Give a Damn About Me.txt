What, what
You don't give a damn about me
Do do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do

You've got some nerve
You call me after all this time
And expect me to be cool
What the heck is wrong with you?
Can't just pop up out of the blue
Baby, that ain't how you do
Someone you're claimin' that you love so true, oh

That disappearing thing
(I don't play that)
I know your phone ain't off
('Cause I pay that)
Am I ok with it, please believe it
('Cause I don't need it)

Why'd you call me (Baby)
If you don't give a damn about me (Damn about me)
Let's see how you do without me (Without me)
Why ya tryna be where I'll be (I be)
You don't give a damn about me
You might also like
Whatever you do, go on and do your thing
But in the meantime, just keep one thing in mind
The way you dress, the way you drive
Was all because of me
Now it's over
Babe, I hope you're happy

That disappearing thing
(I don't play that)
I know your phone ain't off
('Cause I pay that)
Am I ok with it, please believe it
('Cause I don't need it)

Why'd you call me (Baby)
If you don't give a damn about me (Damn about me)
Let's see how you do without me (Without me)
Why ya tryna be where I'll be (I be)
You don't give a damn about me

You call me like I'm supposed to be alone
(But I moved on, so stop wastin' time)
You should know by now I've got someone in my life
You're the last thing that crosses my mind
Why you gotta call me, baby
Why'd you call me (Baby)
If you don't give a damn about me (Damn about me)
Let's see how you do without me (Without me)
Why ya tryin' to be where I'll be (I be)
You don't give a damn about me

Why ya gotta call me (Baby)
Break it on down, break it on down
Let me explain something
Check this out
Woman, I cook and I clean (Baby)
You know what I mean
I buy you everything (Baby)
And you don't give a damn about me

You call me like I'm supposed to be alone
(But I moved on, so stop wasting my time)
You should know by now someone's in my life
You're the last thing that crosses my mind
Why you gotta call me, baby

Why'd you call me (Baby)
If you don't give a damn about me (Damn about me)
Let's see how you do without me (Without me)
Why ya tryin' to be where I'll be (I be)
You don't give a damn about me
I need you
I love you
I want you
You coulda kept that to yourself
Why am I wastin' my breath
