All these years I been wanting you in my life
And now I finally I have you
I'ma do everything in my strength to keep you near
I care about you
I just wanna make you smile, hah
Let's go

All the many days you were on my mind
Visions of me with you all the time
You wasn't looking for a man
You made it clear (clear to me)
And now I'm ever so glad that I have you near

Here in my life, just you and I
We can do whatever we want to
I'm living my life, with you by my side
One day I'ma make you my wife, baby

I was excited 'cause I was fallin', fallin' in love with you
Now that I've fallen, what am I gonna do?
I was excited 'cause I was fallin', fallin' in love with you
Now that I've fallen, what am I gonna do?
