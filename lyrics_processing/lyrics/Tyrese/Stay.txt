No one ever said it'd be easy baby, yeah, woah, woah, yeah
Girl I wanna take the time and thank you
Just for putting up with me
And I'm sorry that you even had to deal with me
Even though I made you cry, I wanna make it right
Just give me some time to make it right
I go the extra mile to make you smile and
Just to make your day
I'll go out my way I'll do whatever it takes
Baby promise you'll stay, stay
Stay baby, would you just
Stay, stay, baby
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Baby won't you stay?
With me?
I know that I messed up over a thousand times
Said you wouldn't forgive me but somehow I changed your mind
And now that we're here, I just can't let you go
And I got your ear, baby girl I gotta let you know
I go the extra mile to make you smile and
Just to make your day
I'll go out my way I'll do whatever it takes
Stay baby, would you just
Stay, stay, baby
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Baby won't you stay?
With me?
Hey, stay, stay, stay

Baby would you stay with me
Put them bags down,let's work it out baby
Stay, stay, stay baby

This time this time, I'mma get it together
Stay, stay, what about the marriage life
You were supposed to be my wife...
