I know sometimes it might get crazy (Crazy, crazy)
I'll always be here for you lady (Lady, lady)
Baby, I'm just tryna change the game (Change the game)
So let me work the thing, let me do my thing

Young, dumb, and full of cum
Lil crazy ass nigga, homie where you from
I bang Yvette, bang the set
Tat on my neck, tec on deck
Yeah, yeah, watch yo' step
He won't fuss He'll just bust
Ask those fucks I left 'em in dust
Trust or bust Cuss and get drunk
And talk big shit Man yo bitch so quick and dip
Hop on the site like like we used to do
Fly handlebars, his All-stars is blue
Keeping it true 7 days a week
And he livin' with his momma
And I heard she a freak
Fucking wit a G-H-G-C 107
Bald head nigga named Melvin
He telling cuz how to live and he a felon
He bailin' Fuck that bullshit he sailin'
You know why?

You just a baby boy
Your not the real mccoy
I've been runnin' these streets
You goin' crazy
What about your baby?
Why you ridin' with heat?
Baby

I gotta baby up the street
Another baby mama around the corner
One I just screw
And the other I make love to
But I'm in and out fool
I can't stay with one bitch I gotta keep it pimpin
But now some drama and I ain't wit it
The nigga that used to knock my song momma up just got out
And mom's threw a nigga out for bangin on his spouse
And that nigga, now he up in baby's house
What I'm gon do, should I set it off
And play myself like a fool, I'ma keep it cool
And see how long this shit gon last
I scooped up my son he tried to play my wit a ghetto pass
I ain't havin' that, grab my strap I got to do something
Fresh out but a nigga got to do something
And I'm a baby boy with nothing to lose
Big Snoop, check it, I'ma lay him down
God dang it, y'all, please believe me
Baby boy, baby boy, baby boy, baby boy
I'm a baby boy, baby boy, gangsta, gangsta (Baby, I know)
I know sometimes it might get crazy (Said it might get little crazy)
I'll always be here for you lady
(I'm not going nowhere from you, babe)
Baby I'm just tryna change the game
(I'm just tryna change the game)
So let me work the thing, let me do my thing

Every time I come and see you
You're telling me what I can and can't do
Girl your losin' your mind, baby
You tell your friends I don't treat you right
You say I'm livin another life
I wanna make you my wife
Yes I do, babe
Girl you're about to drive me crazy
You cut me down and call me lazy
I guess I'm just another baby boy
Oh, no, no, oh-oh, oh
(Where do we go from here, baby?)

You just a baby boy
Your not the real mccoy
I've been runnin' these streets
You goin' crazy
What about your baby?
Why you ridin' with heat?
