It's always me, yeah, uh!
Yeah, beautiful, magnifique, straight up, ah-ha

No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away
No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

It's a proven fact money make the world go round
And a couple sweet words'll make your girl go down
On the whole team 'cause you weren't taking care of business
See me in a Bimmer, see you in a Civic, uh

No time for struggle 'cause we shining today, today
Look out the window see me flying away, away

When I step up in the party, yes I'm letting my nuts hang
Tryna fuck a groupie bitch right on the hood of the Mustang
From a place where they bust things, hailing from Flushing
Peace to Bloodstain, Beamer custame
On a California king where the thug lay (that's word to me man)
The joint longer than Mutombo finger, my features etch
Shorty sniffin' lines like a sketch
Tell her that I need my slippers fetched
I need a wifey tongue longer than Kakey
Shoot the gun right when I whistle, plus she never will snake me
Do a split on my dick
If I'm sick she'll even clean me if I shit in my pants
So I'm taking her to France with me

Doing math like an Asian student
I've been a truant, three language fluent
Blueish on the Buick
Reddish on the hue of the cheeks on my booby
Her body smoking like a dooby
The joint rolled like a croissant, mad butter
Golden brown
If I end up in the can then who gon' hold me down?
Probably no one
They like it when you hot, when you not
They tell you eat a cock off the springboard I dive into the drop
Gold watch, like I just retired
No socks in the loafer cause it's tacky
At least I'm not up in Pataki's
You catch me higher than a Shaq knee
See me swerving side to side like Mutombo finger
The bundle bringer, guns are subtle
Hear them clapping like the end of the huddle
I might be big as a bear, but nothing to cuddle
Hop in the shuttle, land in Russia, yo

Oh man, would you tell these motherfuckers what it is please?
I gotta tell them what it is?
Yeah, I'm asking you to do me that favor
Wilding the street that's what I'm about
What kind of bitch you like?
Man, a bitch with a case on her record..
Okay
I need a bitch that's nice with knives..
Hahaa!
I need a fucking -- Yo..

How many dope fiends you've been locked up with, son?
Yo put that put that back put that back
How many dope fiends you've been locked up with?
Put that back, put it back, put it back, I mean it
How many dope fiends have you been locked up with?
