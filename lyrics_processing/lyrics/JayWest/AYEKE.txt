Mon drop awon rappers in slow mode
Won light bi ti feather
This is my time to reign
Can't you feel the weather
Broom!, Imole ti de a need umberella
So why I wan dey run race, red-made is my medals
Sho mo pe ayetta no dey work for bomb
Me ain't no striker NO' 11 mi ki se omo ibadan
I would rather wait for the dry season be gone
Excuse my un'jill'ness me no fit follow jack fall
Lati kekere mo man woju window pe mo fe lowo ju dangote
My mouth be runnin on this track I call it setting my own pace
Omo yoruba lemi me ain't gettin watcha say

Speed ti mo gbe wa soke o fast ju usain bolt
Da epo is wan lara wa mo reason tan fin pe wan ni camo-
Now am putting rappers in them places mon ta bi ayo

Your money grows like grass my own be like iroko trees
Call me the new guy on your T.V
Mo da bi eni to ko F9 jo, nobody badder than me
