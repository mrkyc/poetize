People breakin' up and just walkin' away from love and that's wrong
That's so wrong
A happy little home comes up for sale
Because two fools have tried and failed to get along
And ya know that's wrong
A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
When neither one of them will love and understa-a-a-a-and
And take it with a grain of salt
Oh, now believe that
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And even the sad love is better than no love at a-l-l
Got to believe that
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And any kind of love is better than no love at all
Nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
No love at all is a poor old man
Standin' on the corner with his hat in his hand
And no place to go, he's feelin' low
No love at all is a child in the street
Dodgin' traffic and beggin' to eat on a tenement row
And that's a long row to hoe
No love at all is a troubled young girl
Standin' on a bridge at the end of the wor-or-or-or-ld
And it's a pretty short fall
Now people believe me
