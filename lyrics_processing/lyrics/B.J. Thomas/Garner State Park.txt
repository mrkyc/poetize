90 miles from of San Antone
There's a place I go each summer
When I get the urge to roam
I stand out on the highway
If I couldn't catch a ride I'd walk
To Garner State Park
Let's go to Garner State Park
Come on along to Garner State Park
Where the prettiest girls in Texas
And from everywhere
Parade their city slicking clothes
And bought some boots and western wear
We swam all through the day
And that's when it gets dark
At Garner State Park
Let's go to Garner State Park
We gotta go to Garner State Park
At the dance I met a girl
She was from old Houston town
She was the queen of the park
She was the prettiest girl around
We walked down to the water
We found a big rock, began to talk
At Garner State Park
Come on and go to Garner State Park

San Antone and everywhere around
Next thing I knew it was 4 am
She said my Mother's surely worried
About where I am
And with the Texas sky above
We couldn't help that we had fallen in love
At Garner State Park
Everything's great after dark
When you're at Garner State Park
But the summer was soon over
And we had to say goodbye
I said we'll see each other next year
As a tear fell from her eye
When I came I knew no sorrow
Now I'm leaving with a broken heart
From Garner State Park
Everything's great after dark
When you're at Garner State Park
Oh, but I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
Yeah
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
Yeah
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
Yeah
I'll be back again next year
I'll be back again next year
Yeah
