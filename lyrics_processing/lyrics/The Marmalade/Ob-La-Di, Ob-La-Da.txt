La la la la life goes on
Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Obla-di, obla-da life goes on, oh
La la la la life goes on
Obla-di, obla-da life goes on, oh
La la la la life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing
Obla-di, obla-da life goes on, oh
La la la la life goes on
Obla-di, obla-da life goes on, oh
La la la la life goes on
In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band
Obla-di, obla-da life goes on, oh
La la la la life goes on
Obla-di, obla-da life goes on, oh
La la la la life goes on
In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band
Obla-di, obla-da life goes on, oh
La la la la life goes on
Obla-di, obla-da life goes on, oh
La la la la life goes on
And if you want some jam
