Uh, haha
You heard the voice
Sorta face made the choice
You right about now, ladies and gentlemen
You rocking with Cory Gunz and Smoke DZA
George Kush da Button
Yeah, Young Money, yeah, Cash Money
Yeah, Mo-litia

Hold up, lil Dutty, whoa Nelly
If it ain't exotic, then I'm not rollin it
If it stink so good like the Indo should
If it's in my pocket, I'll burn a hole in it
Smoke clouds in the whip like pole in it
So high it ain't mine, think I might've stolen it
It'll be fine, nice time, nothin like a tight rhyme
And a couple like crimes I like to go with it
Pineapple, Blueberry, get a bowl of it
Strawberry Kush, hey, get a load of it
Get a Doobie, get a Dutch, get a Swisha, get a Philly
Get a cup, nigga, any kind of way to roll with it
Sour or the Dro with it
Show spinnin, I'm losing focus, I'm soaking
And I ain't neva jokin, okay, I'm playin, I'm jokin', I'm floatin'

I be pasted, Elmer's Crazy Glue, I'm crazy cool
Smoke done got the munchies, now I'm headed up to Amy Roots
"How high did you get? How much bud did you blow?" I answer calmly
Like I'm studyin' terrorism, I fuck with that bomb weed
My shit's approved, what is this, an interview? I make it short like an interlude

I Got a QP of that flavor, slammin' doors and rockin' gators
With a bad bitch that roll up all my blunts and do me favors
Man, I quit smokin' with haters back in 2004
Don't wet my bud, don't blow my high, I'm lettin muthafuckas know
That it's Big Sant, bitch, don't act like you ain't heard
My cologne is a merge of the Kush and the curve
Break it down, grind it, crush it, roll it if it's potent
Takin' tokes, takin' notes, ho, a muthafuckin' smokin'
We get high

High (we get high) and high (we get high)
We get high (we get high) and high (we get high)
