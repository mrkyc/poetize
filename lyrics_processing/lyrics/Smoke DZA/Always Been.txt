Can you turn the beat up a little bit?
Yeah, that's good
Hey, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, hey

Good weed, fine women, fast cars, new clothes
And I'm ready to go (Ready to go)
The further we get, the bigger the check
New cities, more people to know (Uh-huh, people to know)
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin'
But that's how it's always been (Uh)
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin' (Yeah)
But that's how it's always been, hey (Look)

Yeah, a little bit of kush, break it down, sprinkle it in the joint, shit
The type of stoner who be late for his appointments
Fresh white Crest shit, good
Festive, infest the internet, now my shit congested
Got stupid flow, musically amazin'
Let it out like water, so I'm fluid with the cadence
New York, drove up, flew and took a train in
Hit Smoke when I got here, we blazin'
Smoke weed and maintain
And Most Dope with me at any of my engagements
Bunch of fine bitches, line 'em up and arrange 'em
Black, white, Asian, got a whole compilation
They say I'm talkin' crazy, but I'm young and I don't give a fuck
You wanna hate me, but I'm dope, so now you givin' up
Give me your money and I'll divvy it up
Make sure my homies got some liquor they can drink in they cups, what?

I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin' (Yeah)
But that's how it's always been
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin' (Right)
But that's how it's always been, hey

I'm in the wind, plus I'm cool like a Cali night
Might shoot through a few zips, but that's somethin' light
You know I charged through it
Soarin' over the clouds, might fall through it
Ayy, you can't take me out this sour state of mind I'm in
Plus Mac hit me so it's marathon time again
How far is the high life and the finer things?
We worldwide, they doin' minor things
If you ain't flyin' high, then you might as well hate
Thirty-six thousand feet in the air, I'm feelin' great
And I ain't never comin' down
You need your pilot license with you whenever I come around
The dispensary, I done ran through there
It-it's heroina and it's bamboo here

Smoker's Club, baby, we got it all in stock
Good weed, fine women, fast cars, new clothes
And I'm ready to go (Ready to go)
The further we get, the bigger the check

I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin'
But that's how it's always been
