Sierra, Hotel, India, Ecco, Lima, Delta, Shield

We are a force you can believe in (Uh)
I'm just looking for some roll-ups so I can put my weed in (Word)
Hounds of justice
Nah, nigga, live niggas not to be fucked with
Roaring
Walking through the crowd, keep it rolling like Rollins
I don't hear niggas
Not a Deadman on it, you should think I try to spear niggas
Kill 'em, what good is a witness?
Ah, fuck it, it's good for business
The wolves is here
Sheep can't last in the woods for real
Just rolled up the blunt the size an arm
This shit hittin' in some triple power bong
Uh, believe in the kill
Smoker's Club, best believe in the shield (Shield)
I be's in the field
At any moment, thirty P's in your grill
Brave nigga, get a grave, nigga, strapped and they clapped, make a pack and we form
Fake nigga, pump your breaks, niggas putting on an act like he scrap 'til we swarm
Ambush, I'm Ambrose
You gots to respect my handle
Real nigga and I ain't dancing 'round like Fandango
You might also like
Been the man up in this shit
Body slam 'em, kill 'em quick
Body slam 'em, give 'em shit
Elbow drop 'em, show 'em, stop 'em
Niggas don't know when I come up in the door
Kick his shit, break glass when I intro
When I intro blowing on the indo
Stone cold flow, smoke loads, essential
Best in the world, I don't care what you think
Fuck y'all niggas, have a Twist of Fate
Kitchen sink, fresh-ass mink
Woo-ha, fuck y'all think?
Bust 'em, bust 'em, lay 'em down
Sharpshooter, where's the crowd?
Boss man, run the town
Flossing all around

Major bread, razor's edge
Hardcore nigga, take pain instead
Oh no, get the guillotine
Flame the chairs, then I hit you with a DDT
What you really mean?
Heaven knows, I never back down
Never sleep a ho, make her tap out
Smoking Headband, Jimmy Fly Snuka steez
Top rop, jump off, one, two, three
Get the coffin, chokeslam
All a part of the program
So raw, so focused
No pause, no dope shit
No clowns, no Doink shit, pointless
Stone cold, got bodies on hold
Godfather flow, shine on you hoes
Stone cold, bodies on hold
Godfather flow, shine on you hoes
Stay tie dye like Devon or Bubba
Monday night RAW, fuck a whore, no rubber
Pistol to the teller, tell her, "Give me all the cash"
'Cause I robbed the biggest bank in a Mankind mask
Diesel and some hash, motherfuck a DUI
And I'm posted in the sky like Jimmy, super fly
Snuck her into my layer
Then told her to take off her under-layers
Invade her like Vader
Oh, you talkin' shit? See the edge of my razor or jackknife
Fuck the shooting star, press him if he don't act right
Dead Dibiase, you know I'm 'bout my cash, right? (Cha-ching)
Puppies in her blouse and it's 'bout to be a catfight
My niggas sell dust to buy gold
My niggas sip Tuss' to move slow
Y'all niggas talk shit, but y'all don't know
Bitch

Load the spaceship with the rocket fluid
Motherfucker
One year later and the story stays the same
We come in, we dominate, we win, and we leave
Why?
Because we're the best thing going, we said it since day one
