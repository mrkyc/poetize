Big, bad, dangerous
Bronson, DZA, riiiiiiiiight

She's heavy, no Jager, sour in the chamber
Bam Bam Bronson and Big Gram Vader
Big, bad, dangerous
Guyanese nigga with a wild Albanian
Mobbing through the stadium
Them little niggas came and went
Bars on the platter, should be catering
Anybody can get it, no matter what lane you in
We came to win, you came to play; shit, I want the top spot
For that, ack, I'm on your ass like everyday
Disappear like Hoffa at Little Charlie's
Penne alla vodka like a fucking mobster, huh
Wiseguys don't carry wallets, shit I'm liable to
Run up in Rugby and go toss a couple of fazools
Know how I do, made man
Shouts to Thirstin and Meyhem
N-Y Giant, word to Strahan
DZA!

Bronsolino
We got this

Yo, I'm Greg "The Hammer" Valentino, Tinoisamoa haberdashery
Got seven patches, coming through with Patra
Speaking patois, Tuna tartare
Snap my fingers for the waiter, tell him the food was caca
Cause I'm used to plates rated by Zagat
Smoking Kiefer Sutherland
Fuck the government, cop Asian rubs and shit
Paid like a hundred, I'm consistently blunted
Got the fronts right out of Busy Bee
13 Huarache's out of King and Queens
Every other week cause I'm a sneaker fiend
Stole my mother's car and got falafel right on Bleecker Street
Kool G. Rap was pumping out the speaker, chief
I'm getting brain and rolling up, I'm in the green Caprice
Me and DZA treat the tree like Edward Scissor-
Hands of stone, well nowadays I'm getting tan in Rome
The boat, sleep six, the mussels at the bay
Don't ever get it twisted, dog, we hustle everyday

We got kids to feed, miggas ridicule before they help
Got to get it how you live, dog, them bills don't pay theyself
Whether 16 bars or 28 ounces
Whatever I do, I make it count, kid (That's right)
Yo, I'm the captain of this fly shit, futuristic hybrid
Never close my eyelids, dicking down a Thai bitch
Her thighs thick like a rhino skin
Ayo, I'm diving in, slide it back and forth like a violin (Right)
Miri Ben-Ari, mami, ven aqui
No gordo digging that toto loco, them other niggas so-so
Half assed, mediocre at best
42nd Street, they would've got left
Feel what I'm saying?
Chicharron de pollo con hueso, been flavor
Table cloth is beautiful, penetration, uterial
Clenbuterol help when reciting the lyrics
Some family no longer with us, but still behind us in spirit
I said we big, bad, dangerous
Ain't a motherfucker taming us
Right
Know your role or get rolled on
Don't risk it, it's big business
