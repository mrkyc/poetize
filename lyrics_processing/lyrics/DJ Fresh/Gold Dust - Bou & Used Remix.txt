You hear me coming through your spe-ea-kers
You see me mashin' up your airwaves
I know you can't get enough of my sound
It's like gold dust
You hear me coming through your spe-ea-kers
You see me blaggin' up your airwaves
I know you can't get enough of my sound
I don't know where you run from
What you running from, oh?
I don't know where you run from
What you running from, oh?
I don't know where you run from
What you running from, oh?
Oh, you won't free up yourself and fly
There's no place to hurt, so start the fight, I'm gonna get it
Tallest running for me, baby, you're gonna regret it
I can't understand why you can't free yourself and let it
Go, go, go, go
Got you in my palm, now listen good, you can't escape it
Bring you to my world and hold you see if you can take it
Don't you be afraid, I know you're strong enough to make it
Go, go, go
