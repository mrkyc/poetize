I can't control this feeling
Something's happening inside me
Our senses come alive
The chemistry is building
It's something that we're feeling
There's nowhere you can hide

It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
We're gonna feel, we're gonna feel, we're gonna feel better
You can't tame this energy inside
We gotta reach, we gotta reach, we gotta reach higher
I wanna burn, wanna burn, burn like a fire
We gotta move, gotta move, gotta move faster
You can't tame this energy inside

Perpetual emotion
It's just a ripple in the ocean
A shadow in the night
Changes we're making for the better
We're going through together
There's nowhere you can hide
You might also like
It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
We're gonna feel, we're gonna feel, we're gonna feel better
You can't tame this energy inside
We gotta reach, we gotta reach, we gotta reach higher
I wanna burn, wanna burn, burn like a fire
We gotta move, gotta move, gotta move faster
You can't tame this energy inside

It's more than a feeling, we're building a dream that we've always had clear in our sights
Watch it ignite as we open our eye, it's the one way we know to survive
We're powerfully changing the world we're reclaiming, our unity they can't divide
They push us around but we're tearing it down and we're having the time of our life

It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
We're gonna feel, we're gonna feel, we're gonna feel better
You can't tame this energy inside
We gotta reach, we gotta reach, we gotta reach higher
I wanna burn, wanna burn, burn like a fire
We gotta move, gotta move, gotta move faster
You can't tame this energy inside

Stronger
