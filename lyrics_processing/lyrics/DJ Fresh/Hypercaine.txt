Truly free in a way that we always knew it
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
You don't know what you mean to me
I'm too proud to beg on my knees
Guess you know that ill cave in deep
Cause you got the thing I need
I am caught between the cold and the fire
I am caught between the chasm and the wire
All we need is you, baby
All we need is you there and we'll all get through it
Truly free in the way that we always knew it
All we need is you there and we'll all get through it
Truly free in the way that we always knew it
You got something inside worth giving
Now look at the life I'm living
I am hooked on your hypercaine feeling
I can't put my finger on the vibe that's winning
You might also likeI am caught between the river and the ocean
I am caught between the dark and deep emotion
Its the only thing to keep me moving
I can't tire, I'm on the wire
I gotta keep moving on, gotta keep moving on, gotta keep moving on
Gotta keep moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
You should know what you mean to me
No I won't beg on my knees
Can't live without you with me
This town is dead, its time to break free
I guess we put it in the spotlight, ooh yeah
All we need is you, babe
All we need is you there and we'll all get through it
Truly free in the way that we always knew it
All we need is you there and we'll all get through it
Truly free in the way that we always knew it
