So stop the fight, I'm gonna get it
Tallest running for me, baby, you're gonna regret it
I can't understand why you can't free yourself, or let it go, go, go, go
Got you in my Palm, now listen good, you can't escape it
Bring you to ma world and hold you, see if you can take it
Don't you be afraid, I know you're strong enough to make it go, go, go, go
