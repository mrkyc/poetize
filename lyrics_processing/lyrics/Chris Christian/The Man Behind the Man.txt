Behind the stare stood living proof
Of how one man can affect us all
Humbly walking yet standing tall
He had one purpose, he had one goal
He never wavered, from that I'm told
The winning was sweet, the losing hard
But most important of all was his final reward
Seasons came and seasons went
But he always seemed content
It's common knowledge, from what I've known
He never walked alone
'Cause it was only on the field
That He made all the calls
And the Man behind the man
The Man behind the man
The Man behind the man is behind us all
He stood for right and never changed
Work was important but still just a game
He took time for kings and kids
And didn't take credit for the things he did
He left us with the answers he found
He didn't push, but passed it around
And I'm still touched by the things he said
And changed somewhat by the life that he led
You might also likeSeasons came and seasons went
But he always seemed content
It's common knowledge, from what I've known
He never walked alone
'Cause it was only on the field
That He made all the calls
And the Man behind the man
The Man behind the man
The Man behind the man is behind us all
The Man behind the man is behind us all
The Man behind the man is behind us all
And the Man behind the man
The Man behind the man
The Man behind the man is behind us all
The Man behind the man is behind us all
He stood for right and never changed
He's still the same
The Man behind the man is behind us all
And I'm still touched by the things he said
And changed in so many ways
By the life that he led
The Man behind the man is behind us all
Seasons came and seasons went
But he always seemed content
The Man behind the man is behind us all
