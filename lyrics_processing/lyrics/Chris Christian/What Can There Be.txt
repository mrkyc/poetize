Am I hearing you right
How can you give up on us
Without even a fight
No one has ever felt so right as you
Now what am I supposed to do
What can there be but a memory
(What can there be)
Please change your mind and don't leave me
(Without you in my life)
I'm not prepared for the sorrow
(I think about you every day and night)
It gets worse every tomorrow
(What can there be)
You gave me something so magic
(Without you here with me)
Your leaving's no less than tragic
It's too much to understand
How it came to this
Well, we came close to paradise
From an innocent kiss
Those sparkling eyes
That I won't see anymore
Will leave a lonely troubadour

(What can there be)
You gave me something so magic
(Without you here with me)
Your leaving's no less than tragic
Ooh...
Whoa-ooh...
Whoa-ooh-ooh...
Those sparkling eyes
That I won't see anymore
Will leave a lonely troubadour
What can there be but a memory
Please change your mind and don't leave me
I'm not prepared for the sorrow
It gets worse every tomorrow
(What can there be)
Where will I go if you leave now
(Without you in my life)
You've got to stay with me somehow
You gave me something so magic
(What can there be)
Your leaving's no less than tragic
What can there be without you
Without you in my life
Where will I turn to
What can there be without you
Where will I go if you leave me alone
What can there be without you
What can there be, darling
What can there be without you
What can there be without you
What can there be, darling
What can there be
What can there be without you
What can there be, darling
What can there be
What can there be without you
What can there be, darling
