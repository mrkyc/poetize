The moment that I first saw her face
And because of her I understand
Your love for me
I loved her unconditionally
Yet knew someday eventually
She was not mine, but Yours
And one day would leave
It's out of my hands
I did the best that I knew how
Though I wish I'd known then
What I know how
It's out of my hands
And all that's left to do is pray
To You and just say
She's in Yours now
We prayed for her before she was here
Oh, we laughed as well as cried a few tears
And I'm thankful for the angel you sent
To protect her each day
From now on there is little to do
But love her knowing You love her too
And treasure all the memories we've shared
No one ever can take away

I did the best that I knew how
Though I wish I'd known then
What I know how
It's out of my hands
And all that's left to do is pray
To You and just say
She's in Yours now
It's out of my hands
I did the best that I knew how
Though I wish I'd known then
What I know how
It's out of my hands
And all that's left to do is pray
To You and just say
She's in Yours now
(Out of my hands, out of my)
(Out of my hands, out of my)
(Out of my hands, out of my)
She's out of my hands
Thank You for the angel You sent to us
(Out of my hands, out of my)
We both know she's out of my
(Out of my hands, out of my)
Out of my
She is out of my hands
(Out of my hands, out of my)
Did the best we could
(Out of my hands, out of my)
