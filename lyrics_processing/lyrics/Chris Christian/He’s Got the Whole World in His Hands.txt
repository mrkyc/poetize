Here, Courtney, take my hand
There, see, everything's fine
You're gonna be okay, now
Does God have hands, Daddy?
He sure does, Court
He has big soft hands
That hold the whole world
You know what else God holds
In His big soft hands?
What, Daddy?
He holds you, Courtney!
In fact, He not only holds you
But He holds everybody
In the whole world at the same time
You want to sing a little bit about it?
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
