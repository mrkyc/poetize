If there's a God, why'd he make me?
All of these flaws is all that I see
If there's a God, I don't believe
Someone as perfect as you would love me, god damnit

Praying to a ghost, hoping he gets it
The last three girls I fucked didn't listen
The last two pills I took haven't kicked in
Having these one night stands with addiction
Now I gotta catch a red-eye to Michigan
Playing a show, then a girl that I'm getting with
Fuck it I'm young, I can act like an idiot
How many sins I gotta make 'til I get the hint?

If there's a God, why'd he make me?
All of these flaws is all that I see
If there's a God, I don't believe
Someone as perfect as you would love me, god damnit

Baby, you're a ghost, why are you missing?
Maybe 'cause I haven't hit you back in a minute
Maybe 'cause I flirt with every girl in existence
I blame it on distance, that I'm being distant
But I don't fucking care, I gotta sing to these kids quick
I remember never having fans that would listen
Now I got a thousand every city I visit
It's just that, you ain't here now and I miss it
See Call Me Karizma LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
But shit it's 4 AM, pouring rain out
Bored again, so I break down
Go and send more than "hey" now, now
I fucked up, of course I did
The more I think now
I should quit, forfeit the crown
Give this up to not let you down again

If there's a God, why'd he make me?
All of these flaws is all that I see
If there's a God, I don't believe
