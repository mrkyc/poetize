Don't fucking talk to me
Sorry to be blunt
You'll probably need one to
Forget all the things
You've done to me
I don't know what's got in me
I guess I'm just over being fucked over
Letting you walk on me
But I love the pain and I'm

Having these fragile dreams
Every night you haunt me in my head
As you leave, these casualties
I'm scared to close my eyes when I'm in bed

I don't ever wanna go to sleep
I don't ever wanna go to sleep
I don't ever wanna go to sleep
I don't ever wanna go to sleep

Why did you do me like that, lover?
You said you weren't like my last lover
Like why did I go share half the covers with you?
Why did you string me along, babe?
Sleepless nights turn to long days
To follow your ass was the wrong way
So I pray
Now I lay me down to sleep
No ones on the side of me
Now happy I won't try to be
No wonder why I keep

Having these fragile dreams
Every night you haunt me in my head
As you leave, these casualties
I'm scared to close my eyes when I'm in bed

I don't ever wanna go to sleep
I don't ever wanna go to sleep
I don't ever wanna go to sleep
I don't ever wanna go to sleep

I wish you would ask if I'm still okay
Raindrops fall on my pillow case
I'm feeling gray
I'm feeling
My head pounds every night you're away
Painkillers might kill the pain
But, I feel the same
I feel the same

I don't ever wanna go to sleep
I don't ever wanna go to sleep
I don't ever wanna go to sleep
