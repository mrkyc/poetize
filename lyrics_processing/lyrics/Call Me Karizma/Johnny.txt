Teacher, teacher can't tell me nothing
Only word I learned was dysfunction
Ahh, yeah, ah
Mom and daddy, you just don't get it
All the kids at school say I'm different
Ahh, yeah, ah

Johnny's got a loaded .45
Found it in his dad's shoebox
Johnny doesn't wanna be alive
But he's gotta make his school stop
He's, sick of being bullied, his mother's starting to worry
But she doesn't want to ask him or try to call the authorities
Now he is on the bus, again it's just another morning
But he doesn't got a book, he's got a gun without a warning
(He's gotta gun!)

Cindy's got a scholarship to Yale (Yale)
Wants to be a nurse and spread love (Help people)
Cindy's moving out before the fall
Only got a week 'til school's done
Taking every final is easy, she doesn't mind 'em
She's always nice to the kids that are coming in way behind her
She would never hurt a fly or bat an eye, she's way too kind
But then a flash and then a cry and sees Johnny with a rifle

Johnny sees Cindy in the hall (Get the fuck--)
Runs to go and get her by the hair (Come here bitch)
Cindy didn't want to be involved (Not me please!)
Johnny says "Stay the fuck here" (Stay the fuck here)
Starts to hear sirens and everybody is crying
The police are outside and now Cindy's inside a closet (Police!)
And she doesn't want to die, she's got a bible in her pocket
But where the fuck is God when the world's getting way too violent?
Eyes, closed
Praying for her life while the shots, go
Screaming for the cops but they're not, close
She's not writing letters, but where's John Doe?
He's right here
Grabs Cindy by her bright white hair (Come here)
Says to be quiet or your life ends here
But the door breaks down and now John gets scared
So he puts the gun to her head, life ain't fair
"Let me tell you about my life quick, I'm the fuckin' shy kid
At the party I'm the kid that never got invited
I'm the one that failed every test, every problem
It's not fucking fair you're in Yale for your college
Goddamn my mom can't stand she's drunk
Pop xans, I can't stand feeling numb
Stop moving Cindy! You squeal too much!"
"Pop" goes the gun, another school shot at
Teacher, teacher can't tell me nothing
Only word I learned was dysfunction
Ahh, yeah, ah
Mom and daddy, you just don't get it
All the kids at school say I'm different
Ahh, yeah, ah

Reporting live from  high school
We're now learning more about the terrible event that took place
And what can drive someone that seemed like a normal kid
To do something so evil and inhumane
We're asking everyone and anyone that sees warning signs
To please offer help and love and compassion
To those who need it
