Hello
No one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone

Making friends with my four walls
They never wanna talk back and that's okay
They keep me up when my world falls down
At 4 A.M. when I'm sad and wide awake
I'm making jokes to my nightstand
Gossiping to my ceiling 'bout some girl
Said you'd call, but you lied and now
I sit alone in my own depressing world

Ring one, ring two
Pick up 'cause I need you
I said I moved on, but that shit ain't true
I'm so hung up wishing I could hang up on
You, you, oh oh
You, you, oh oh

Singing songs to my pictures
Found the one of us dancing at your prom
Promise that I don't miss her but
I'm a liar and liars lie a lot
Saw your Facebook and checked it
I regret it, I get it, you're moving on
But can you give me a second?
I gotta tell you I love you 'fore you're gone

Pick up 'cause I need you
I said I moved on, but that shit ain't true
I'm so hung up wishing I could hang up on
You, you, oh oh
(Wishing I could hang up on)
You, you, oh oh
(Wishing I could hang up on)
You, you, oh oh
(Wishing I could hang up on)
You, you, oh oh
(Wishing I could hang up on)

Lie and say that you miss me
Fake that you're listening
Pick up the phone, babe
By the third ring, my heart is hurting
And I'ma die feeling lonely
I cannot let go
So I'll just settle to listen to your answering machine
Machine, why you gotta be so mean? Like

Ring one, ring two
Pick up 'cause I need you
I said I moved on, but that shit ain't true
I'm so hung up wishing I could hang up on...
You
