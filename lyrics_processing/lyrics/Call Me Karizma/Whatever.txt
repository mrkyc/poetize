The world's a big frowny face
Seems everyone's sad all around this place
Instead of tryna live every ounce of it
We'd rather sit around and just count the days
I know, I'm guilty as charged
Fuck waking up man, I'mma kill my alarm
I wanna be happy and start feeling my heart
But pretending to be happy isn't really that hard
But last night on the ride home I saw
A homeless man approach me with open arms
He said, "Son, life's great and I know you are
So hold your head high, kid, and go for the stars"
I said, "Hell Yeah! Hell Yeah! I'mma do that
Fuck this town, I'll never move back"
Momma told me, "Whatever you get, to love what you have"

My list of shit's piling up again (whatever, whatever)
I'm sick of being broke without a cent (whatever, whatever)
When these days drag on, I'mma sing this song
Yeah my life's a bitch, but I love that bitch (forever, forever)
Singing, Na na na (whatever, whatever)
Singing, Na na na (whatever, whatever)

My car's broke down, my banks empty
But it seems that everything's okay
My heart won't run and school's no fun
But you know what man, everything's okay
My girl dumped me, I have nothing
But I know that everything's okay
My friends ditched me, we had history
But still simply, everything's okay
And that's the truth though, life is kinda brutal
Fall and hit my face and face the world but I'm a Pluto
I got a lot of problems but don't get a lot of kudos
I'mma never lose hope

I'm falling back down to Earth, but I'll enjoy the ride
The ride, the ride
I'm falling back down to Earth, but I'll enjoy the ride
The ride, the ride, and everything's alright
