Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck

Whoa, what do you know?
This song won't make it on the radio
'Cause this shit's too hard and the world's so soft
"Oh my God, I'm so offended"
I'm not that great at math
But this song might cut my fanbase in half
I'm hard and the world's so soft
"Oh my God, I'm so offended"

I don't make pop songs, I songs that pop in Hong Kong
It's rock your mom wants to turn the fuck off
But since my song's on, she's turned the fuck on
Love gets what love wants
Anyways, I managed to get the entire planet to hate me
You gotta hand it to me, I deserve a Grammy
You bitches don't understand me
"Bitch is something you can't say!"
Bitch, you already banned me by tweeting your little thread
Hashtag, hashtag, throw 'em in the trash bag
"Oh my God, he said fag in 2012"
Shut the fuck up
In 2012, you were probably twelve, drinking your chocolate milk
It's obvious to everyone it's not a big deal
You're just begging for attention that you wanted to feel
There's hardly any artist saying shit that's raw or that's real
"Well, going against the grain is really not in my deal"

I check Twitter, y'all just bitter
Y'all acting like I said ******
I get bigger every time you tweet shit or say something
I should sell that dumb shit on a sticker
I don't get mad though, I'm not an asshole (I am)
You're in my lane bitch, I'm gonna pass though
Dishing out hot shit, you're just a casserole
Baby, you're that close
Anyway, I managed to get the entire planet to listen
You gotta hand it to me, I deserve a handy
Fuck it, give me one Grammy, after make me a sammy
I'm kidding give me some candy, I'm fucking sweeter than wine
I'll shove a tweet in your eye, I'll cut you easy as pie
I'll fucking leave you to die, all bloody, screaming and crying
I'd love to see you survive, it's just to keep a surprised
I'll cut you deeper this time, it's fun to see you like I was
And before this ends, I wanna make it clear
You can't stop me bitches, I ain't going nowhere
