Mommy, wake up
I got school in an hour
And I still need breakfast
Say some
I hate when you mumble
Please, come to your senses

This Coca-Cola got you
Tripping over onto
The kitchen counter
Can you drink some water
Now, I miss you mom
Every night I sing this song

If I were an angel
I could fly away from here
I'm surrounded by strangers
And no one knows just how I feel
Both of my wings broke
I can't seem to fix 'em
All these happy pills won't listen
If I were an angel
I could finally disappear

I can't think straight
Been in school for an hour
And I haven't learn shit, I replay
Thoughts of my parents fighting
But I'm who they're hurting

This Motorola got me
Texting no one, I'll be
All alone forever
Someday maybe I'll be with you mom
'Til then I'ma sing this song

If I were an angel
I could fly away from here
I'm surrounded by strangers
And no one knows just how I feel
Both of my wings broke
I can't seem to fix 'em
All these happy pills won't listen
If I were an angel
I could finally disappear

So I grab the semi-automatic in the safe
Load the clip with all these mounting problems that I face
Feel the steel against my temple 'til I feel okay
Maybe if I fall to the ground I could fly away
If I were an angel
I could fly away from here
I'm surrounded by strangers
And no one knows just how I feel
If I were an angel
I could fly away from here
I'm surrounded by strangers
And no one knows just how I feel
Both of my wings broke
I can't seem to fix 'em
All these happy pills won't listen
If I were an angel
