I'm not fine
I'm caught between the lines
That I don't see, I don't see
I'm traumatized
From hearing all these lies
That you speak
I wish I could wash you out with bleach
I wish I could wash you

If I could find a word that was worse than hate
I would surely say it right up to your face
At the first chance that occurs
I'm not a hateful person
You brought out a different version
I'm not who I was before
I no longer hide behind curtains

This is your fault, your blame
You've gone insane
I called your bluff, you called to say
You don't think we'll make it
But I called today, I'm not okay
Eyeballs are drained
I've lost my way
Now you got me saying that--

I'm not fine
I'm caught between the lines
That I don't see, I don't see
I'm traumatized
From hearing all these lies
That you speak
I wish I could wash you out with bleach
I wish I could wash you

Dye my hair with bleach
Wash my mouth out with bleach
Bust my fuckin' lip
Clean my shirt of blood out with bleach
In the curse of love
You're the one cursing my dreams
I don't wanna wake up
If you're not laying by me and
Maybe I don't get you 'cause I don't get you
The kind of miss you
I kind of miss you
Doesn't do justice and speaking of justice
Imma need your judgement to leave in abundance
Even all you what-ifs
Keep to a hush let's try to be productive
This is your fault, your blame
I've gone insane
I called your bluff, you called to say
You don't think we'll make it
But I called today, I'm not okay
Eyeballs are drained
I've lost my way
Now you got me saying that-

I'm not fine
I'm caught between the lines
That I don't see, I don't see
I'm traumatized
From hearing all these lies
That you speak
I wish I could wash you out with bleach
