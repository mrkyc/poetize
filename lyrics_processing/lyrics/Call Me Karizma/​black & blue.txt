I had a good day until I thought of you
The grass isn't so green from my cloudy point of view

Open my eyes to the rain
Close them and hope that it ends
You said you'd be here forever
But I didn't think you meant friends
Scrolled through your phone when you slept in
Saw shit I'd never forget
It's crazy how hearts in a message
Can break someone's heart when they're sent

So cut the lame shit, I don't say shit
I don't do shit to hurt you, bitch
I just stay in my own lane and
Hope you love me enough to quit
La, la, la, act okay
One more shot, half a day
One more wrong and your ass is waved
Nah, nah, nah, I just have to say

I had a good day until I thought of you
The grass isn't so green from my cloudy point of view
I can't see the bright side
Been so dark since you moved
Now all I wear is black and all I feel is blue
See Call Me Karizma LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
You've got me so fucked up
I can't think anymore
You've taught me all my colors
Now I can't see anymore
Blocked you on all of my socials
Then made a fake one just to check
It's crazy how hearts on a newsfeed
Can break my heart when it's read

So cut the fake shit
I don't play with all your feels like you do to me
Now I'm pacing in my basement
Missing colors that I can't see
La, la, la, dressed in black
Coffee shops, all depressed decaf
All I want is a message back
Probably not, but I guess I'll ask

I had a good day until I thought of you
The grass isn't so green from my cloudy point of view
I can't see the bright side
Been so dark since you moved
Now all I wear is black and all I feel is blue
Why is my life
So black and white with you
My eyes are raining at night
Hands filled like the ocean blue

I had a good day until I thought of you
The grass isn't so green from my cloudy point of view
I can't see the bright side
Been so dark since you moved
Now all I wear is black and all I feel is blue
I had a good day until I thought of you
The grass isn't so green from my cloudy point of view
I can't see the bright side
Been so dark since you moved
