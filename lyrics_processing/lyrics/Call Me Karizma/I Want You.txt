I don't wanna say it
I don't think we'll make it
Still I-I-I want you
I-I-I want you
I don't wanna fake it
I love you and I hate it
Still I-I-I want you
I-I-I want you

I grabbed your toothbrush
Broke it in half
Took every fucking shirt you loved and soaked it in gas
Threw every little picture that we took in the past
And lit a match
I hope you're happy
I'm over your ass
I hate you, I hate you
I promise you so
All these letters that I wrote are in the garbage disposed
All these feelings that I have are either dark or are cold
Then you text me with a heart and I'm so, I Just know

I don't wanna say it
I don't think we'll make it
Still I-I-I want you
I-I-I want you
I don't wanna fake it
I love you and I hate it
Still I-I-I want you
I-I-I want you
(I do, do, do)

Woke up without you
Nothing new
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout you
But I do
Mama said it's over
Probably true
But Mama, you don't know her
Like I do
So I give it a shot
A minute, a thought
You love to see me hurt
And I feel shitty a lot
I'm on the fucking road in every city I stop
I tried to lose you in another girl
In case you forgot

I don't wanna say it
I don't think we'll make it
Still I-I-I want you
I-I-I want you
I don't wanna fake it
I love you and I hate it
Still I-I-I want you
I-I-I want you
(I do, do, do
I do, do, do
I do, do, do)
So lay me down, lay me down, lay me down smooth
I hate it how crazy I feel about you
I played about 80 times
Singing a blues
And I still can't get over you
So lay me down, lay me down, lay me down smooth
I hate it how crazy I feel about you
I played about 80 times
Singing a blues
And I still can't get over you

I don't wanna say it
(I don't wanna say)
I don't think we'll make it
Still I-I-I want you
(I do, I do)
I-I-I want you
I don't wanna fake it
(I don't wanna fake it)
I love you and I hate it
(I love you and I hate it)
Still I-I-I want you
(I do, I do)
I-I-I want you
(I do, do, do)
So lay me down, lay me down, lay me down smooth
I hate it how crazy I feel about you
I played about 80 times
Singing a blues
And I still can't get over you
(I do, do, do)
So lay me down, lay me down, lay me down smooth
