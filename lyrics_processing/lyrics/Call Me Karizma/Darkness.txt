Hi, you're wasting my time
You're basically the reason that I'm hating my life
You're basically the aching pain I feel every night
You're taking me to places that I really don't like
Why you only call me when you're lonely?
Text me when you're bored, at 1 AM or when you're horny?
Feeling like you feel me only when I feel your body
You only want me when you know you ain't got me (Got me)
Yeah, I'm sick of my head, really sick of being sick in the head
Sick of sticking with the asses as you step out of bed
Then you slide into my DM's and you rip me to shreds
Every woman in my life's gone, Tara, Sarah, Emily will never be the ones
Scared I'll be alone forever, guess I'll need a gun
'Cause I ain't got a shot at being happy if your not

Darkness, darkness, wrap me in your arms
Even though you leave, you're there when we're apart
You can't see my scars, they finally went away
You can't see the scars but I still feel the pain
Darkness, darkness, wrap me in your arms
Even though you leave, you're there when we're apart
You can't see my scars, they finally went away
You can't see the scars but I still feel the pain

Black and I'm blue, and hoping you're having it too
You've broken my back and my heart and everything hasn't improved
You've broken my trust and promised you wouldn't again
But once you're a cheater you'll always be that way 'til the end
So here I am, 3AM, thinking 'bout you
I don't fucking care that's a lie, 'cause I do
Cross my heart, poke my eye, blurry up my view
'Cause truthfully you suck and I don't want to see the truth

Darkness, darkness, wrap me in your arms
Even though you leave, you're there when we're apart
You can't see my scars, they finally went away
You can't see the scars but I still feel the pain
Darkness, darkness, wrap me in your arms
Even though you leave, you're there when we're apart
You can't see my scars, they finally went away
You can't see the scars but I still feel the pain

You are the poison in my air
You tend to kill me but I need you if you care
I wanna die, die, die but you're keeping me alive, live, live
You are the tar inside my lungs
You are my lullaby but our last song's been sung
I hope you die, die, die
But I'm keeping you alive, live, live
Darkness, darkness, wrap me in your arms
Even though you leave, you're there when we're apart
You can't see my scars, they finally went away
You can't see the scars but I still feel the pain
Darkness, darkness, wrap me in your arms
Even though you leave, you're there when we're apart
You can't see my scars, they finally went away
