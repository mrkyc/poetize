You make me feel like I'm six feet under
Close the coffin, I'm sick of talking, yeah
You make me feel like I'm just another lover
But I ain't in lover with you

Making out in your car
After school by the park
Hope your mom doesn't call
Gets you home before dark
If your dad doesn't know
Then we're good on the low
Tell your boy it's a phase
Tell your friends that we're bros
Heartbreaker, you know that
I'm like Darth Vader, soul is black
If you want me you won't look back
You got it, got it, got it, are you
All talk or will you act?
Got me so dead when you walk past
Digging so deep under the grass
I promise, promise, promise that

You make me feel like I'm six feet under
Close the coffin, I'm sick of talking, yeah
You make me feel like I'm just another lover
But I ain't in lover with you
You make me feel like I'm six feet under
Close the coffin, I'm sick of talking, yeah
You make me feel like I'm just another lover
But I ain't in lover with you
See Call Me Karizma LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
All I want is the taste
Of your lips on my tongue
You're the buzz that i need
It's a drug, you're the plug
You're the bitch that I hate
When I'm home and it's late
When in bed and you ain't
Feeling dead in my grave
Grim reaper, you are though, better
Dig deeper, make that hole
All you're past lovers hate me, so
Get on it, on it, on it, got me
Just falling dominoes, leaving
Me scarred like Papa Roach
Even mom said you gotta go
But I can't seem to stop it as

You make me feel like I'm six feet under
Close the coffin, I'm sick of talking, yeah
You make me feel like I'm just another lover
But I ain't in lover with you
You make me feel like I'm six feet under
Close the coffin, I'm sick of talking, yeah
You make me feel like I'm just another lover
But I ain't in lover with you
