No words, no words, can describe
The way you make me feel all the time
No words, no words, can explain
The way you make me feel it's insane
No words, no words, can define
The way you make me feel in my mind
No words, no words, can explain
And I don't know, I don't know why

You got me breathless
Tryna figure out my message
I guess it's that, I loved you before I said it
Hol' up, let me think a sec
Let's go swinging on a swinging set
Your pretty smile brings me back
I got 25 cents, put a ring on that
Your numbers the same as the thoughts in my brain
That will pop-up each day
Like my songs in your playlist
They're often replayed and I'm not gonna play
Like I know what this says
So offer to play this

No words, no words, can describe
The way you make me feel all the time
No words, no words, can explain
The way you make me feel it's insane
No words, no words, can define
The way you make me feel in my mind
No words, no words, can explain
And I don't know, I don't know why...
And I don't care why..why...

You got me speechless
All the words feelin' reachless
It seems that I fell in love
Before I learned what the birds and the bees was
Yeah...
Can we search the web?
To find out how to search my head
To find words that are perfect and define how you're the perfect friend
I search an almanac, paperback, a dictionary front to back
Nothing got through to you
So I found the thesaurus to find some words for us
And me and G put it all up in a chorus

No words, no words, can describe
No words, no words, can explain
No words, no words, can define
No words, no words, can explain
And I don't know, I don't know why...why
