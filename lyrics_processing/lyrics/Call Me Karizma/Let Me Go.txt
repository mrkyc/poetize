My mother cleans houses, dad works at a bank
Curse of that is people think my life is perfect, it ain't
Hurts me to say I felt I wasn't what they urged me to be
I was never what my brother was, I learned right away
At ten I wrote my first song, at twelve recorded it all
It felt important at first
"But honey Morgan, that's false, you gotta go to your room
Say prayers while holding your palms
Forget this music it's through, don't think you're getting involved."
But mom I'm older, it's cool, don't wanna go by your rules
I'm just a fucking outcast and no one knows me at school
I don't smoke, I don't drink
Don't wanna grow to be you

Just let me go, I'm ok
Be back to show you the proof

Let me try, let me grow
Let me live, but you won't
Let me go, let me go
Step aside, let me show
I can drive down this road
Let me go, let me go

I was sixteen when I performed my first show
No one came with except the homie that drove
Fuck it, we're going alone
Got off stage, not a text on my phone
No congrats, no "we're proud", no one to tell me I'm dope
Eighteen I moved out to school
I brought my notebook to write
Hoping to jot a song a day and then record it at night
My parents told me I was finished
"You won't tour in your life
You ain't bringing a thing to college, not a cord or a mic"
But mom, I'm older, it's fine
Fuck all these homework assignments
I've been dreaming of this, but I ain't closing my eyes
I don't smoke, I don't drink
I'm in my dorm every night

Just let me go, I'm ok
Be back at home when it's time

Let me try, let me grow
Let me live, but you won't
Let me go, let me go
Step aside, let me show
I can drive down this road
Let me go, let me go
At nineteen, I lost hope, moved back to my moms
I took a couple classes still, just to have when I want
I tried everything I knew, every rap, every song
But nothing worked, and no one saw the vision that I had brought
I checked my twitter at noon, on lunch break at my shift
I read "I'm going on tour, who should I take along with?"
I told my fans "This is it, tweet him back I'm the shit"
The next day I got an email that I was picked
I fucking told you mom, I'm never coming back here
Touring 50 states, in 60 days with blackbear
Now I'm playing shows at twenty-two and I have fans here
