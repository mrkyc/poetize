Fuck going out
I'd rather stay home
And lay in bed
And fuck to Frank Ocean, oh
Oh, oh
All these nights
Remember the most
Are when we're high
Forgetting our clothes and oh
Oh, oh

A flower opens up for a ray
Like every message that you sent me today
Showing everything except for your face
Send me the address so I can get to your place
I've been thinking 'bout you
Let's build a fort
Fuck this traffic baby
I wish I could teleport
Hit me softly till the feathers fly onto the floor
It's kinda crazy all the things we use a pillow for

Fuck going out
I'd rather stay home
And lay in bed
And fuck to Frank Ocean, oh
Oh, oh
All these nights
Remember the most
Are when we're high
Forgetting our clothes and oh
Oh, oh
Me and you're alone
See Call Me Karizma LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
I like the way that you
Look when you're wearing my white tee
I see you smiling when trying on
Both of my Nikes
There's no-one outside of this room
That I'd rather have by me
So let's stay in bed (So let's stay in bed)
So let's stay in bed

Fuck going out
I'd rather stay home
And lay in bed
And fuck to Frank Ocean, oh
Oh, oh
All these nights
Remember the most
Are when we're high
Forgetting our clothes and oh
Oh, oh
Me and you're alone
Fuck going out
I'd rather stay home
And lay in bed
And fuck to Frank Ocean, oh
Oh, oh
All these nights
Remember the most
Are when we're high
Forgetting our clothes and oh
Oh, oh
Me and you're alone
Lay with me, lay with me
Baby won't sleep till the sunrise
The city is too bright
We should stay inside
Lay with me, lay with me
Baby won't speak cause we're tongue tied
The city is too live
Stay with me tonight

Fuck going out
I'd rather stay home
And lay in bed
And fuck to Frank Ocean, oh
Oh, oh
All these nights
Remember the most
Are when we're high
Forgetting our clothes and oh
Oh, oh
Me and you're alone
Fuck going out
I'd rather stay home
And lay in bed
And fuck to Frank Ocean, oh
Oh, oh
All these nights
Remember the most
Are when we're high
Forgetting our clothes and oh
Oh, oh
