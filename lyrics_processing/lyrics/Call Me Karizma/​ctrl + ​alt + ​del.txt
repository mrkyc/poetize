All of these things, I'm too god damn scared to tell you
Control, Alt, Delete
These feelings in me, only you know the shit I've been through

Eight hours of watching my mother down bottles of Jack
I thought nothing of it when she drove us all to the park
At twelve I was losing my friends that I never got back
Now they hit me up and say "Riz I knew you'd go far"
Fuck you, I don't have shit
I have a little money now that I spend
I have one hundred girls on a list that don't even know my real name, dang
Trying to be loyal, but I have a show in Atlanta, and Anna says she's coming through
Got a friend, call her Hannah, whatever, don't matter, 'cause after one glass and I'm through

At fifteen I'm downing the dose that my doctor prescribed
I thought nothing of it when I drank it down with my milk
At twenty I'm writing a song about wanting to die
Now I can't get out of bed without taking a pill
What's new? I don't have shit
I have a little buzz in town where I live
I have one hundred girls on the list, that have a city next to their name
Trying to be humble, but I have a show in L.A. and some models are giving it up
I'm sorry I'm shitty, I'm just in the city, tonight, in the morning, I'm done

Pipe it out, write it down
I can't seem to talk about you (About you)
Lights are out, lying down
Thinking about my life without you (Without you)
