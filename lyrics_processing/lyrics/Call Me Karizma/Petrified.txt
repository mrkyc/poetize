(That's a wonderful acoustic, let's go
We ready? Alright)

I'm petrified
Scared of letting you inside my headspace
I testify
I'm obsessed with every lie you've said, babe

Sick of being scared of waking up
So sick of loving you, I'm throwing up
Sick of making music you don't listen to
But tell your fucking friends the song's about you and it sucks, huh
By the way, I really miss your face
Been a minute since you came into my place
But the second that you do, we start to fight
And then we fuck and then you leave
And text me "It was a mistake", shit

And I shouldn't love you
Look what we've come to
You're always in my thoughts, babe
But never in my bedroom

I'm petrified, scared of letting you inside my headspace
I testify, I'm obsessed with every lie you've said, babe
I'm terrified, I want you out
You've made my mind a haunted house
I'm petrified but I love the way you frighten me, babe, yeah

I don't wanna end it but I will
I don't wanna end up in your will
I don't wanna leave you but I swear to God, you're evil
'Cause you pop into my head just like these pills
By the way, I really miss your face
Been a minute since you told me, "It's okay"
But the second that you do, you're fucking lying
'Cause the spider webs are growing, taking over everything, fuck

And I shouldn't love you
Look what we've come to
You're always in my thoughts, babe
But never in my bedroom

I'm petrified, scared of letting you inside my headspace
I testify, I'm obsessed with every lie you've said, babe
I'm terrified, I want you out
You've made my mind a haunted house
I'm petrified but I love the way you frighten me, babe
You are a ghost, you haunt me at night
And I am the host, you are the virus
You are a ghost, you haunt me at night
