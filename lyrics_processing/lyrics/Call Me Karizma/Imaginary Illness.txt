You can't see my scars
It's hard to read my thoughts I'm feeling
Guess they're not real then
You believe in God
But even God doesn't show his face when you need to talk
I'm still sick
Imaginary illness

I met the devil in my dreams
He said my dreams are what I never will achieve
He said I'm never getting better and I need to stop using words together like mental and disease
That when hell will fucking freeze
I'm a basket case
Maybe I should lock my stupid ass away
Feeling like I'm half-awake from all these pills I have to take
No one even asks or fucking wonders if I am okay
I'm locked inside my head and I just can't escape

You can't see my scars
It's hard to read my thoughts I'm feeling
Guess they're not real then
You believe in God
But even God doesn't show his face when you need to talk
I'm still sick
Imaginary illness

I hate parties, I hate people
I hate the kinda friend that only calls you when they need you
I fucking hate my bed but never leave it
Like a girl does when she's beaten
Start to love the pain I'm feeling
Feeling numb is not me healing
Someone give me something to live for
I can't wake up to no one and expect me to feel more
I used to dream of seeing my face up on the billboards
Now all I want is you to fucking see what I'm ill for

It's all in your head
You're always upset
You call it disease
I call it depressed
It's all in your head
You're always upset
You call it disease
I call it depressed
It's all in your head
You're always upset
You call it disease
I call it depressed
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
You can't see my scars
It's hard to read my thoughts I'm feeling
Guess they're not real then
You believe in God
But even God doesn't show his face when you need to talk
I'm still sick
