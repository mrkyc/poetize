Five four, black hair
Never had her dad there
Kissed a lot of boys but
Never seems to have care
She just wants vodka and cigarettes
Has her dealer on speed dial
When she gets stressed

And she knows, she knows
She knows, she knows
I can't resist her ways
And she knows, she knows
I'm so exposed
To all the tricks she plays

I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I love getting my heart broke
She's got a tattoo sleeve and smokes a bag of weed
And her haircut is way fucking shorter than me
I think I fell in love with an art hoe

Wakes up at noon
Gets up when she has to
Makeup up on her nightstand
Cocaine in the bathroom
She just wants love that she never gets
Has my number on speed dial when she needs sex

And she knows, he knows
He knows, he knows
I can't resist her ways
And she knows, she knows
I'm so exposed
To all the tricks she plays

I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I love getting my heart broke
She's got a tattoo sleeve and smokes a bag of weed
And her haircut is way fucking shorter than me
I think I fell in love with an art hoe

I wish I never got
Caught up and never
Talked to her, oh what did I do
She ripped my heart in half
Took me for all I have
Got nothing left but it's cool
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I love getting my heart broke

I think I fell in love with an art hoe
I think I love getting my heart broke
She's got a tattoo sleeve and smokes a bag of weed
And her haircut is way fucking shorter than me
I think I fell in love with an art hoe
