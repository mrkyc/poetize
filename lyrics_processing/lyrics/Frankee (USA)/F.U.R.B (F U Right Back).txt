Oh
Oh
No, no, no
(You know there are two sides to every story)

See, I don't know why you cryin' like a bitch
Talkin' shit like a snitch
Why'd you write a song 'bout me?
If you really didn't care, you wouldn't wanna share
Tellin' everybody just how you feel

Fuck what I did, was your fault somehow
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out
Fuck all the cryin', it didn't mean jack
Well, guess what yo, fuck you right back
Fuck what I did, was your fault somehow
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out
Fuck all the cryin', it didn't mean jack
Well, guess what yo, fuck you right back

You thought you could really make me moan
I had better sex all alone (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
I had to, to do your friend
Now you want me to come back
You must be smokin' crack
I'm goin' else where and that's a fact

Fuck all those nights, I moaned real loud
Fuck it, I faked it, aren't you proud?
Fuck all those nights you thought you broke my back
Well, guess what yo, your sex was wack
Fuck all those nights, I moaned real loud
Fuck it, I faked it, aren't you proud?
Fuck all those nights you thought you broke my back
Well, guess what yo, your sex was wack

Oh, oh
Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh
Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh
Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh
Uh, uh, yeah

You questioned: "Did I care?"
Maybe I would have if you woulda gone down there
Now it's, over
But I do admit I'm glad, I didn't catch your crabs
I can't sweat that 'cause I got to go
Fuck what I did, was your fault somehow
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out
Fuck all the cryin', it didn't mean jack
Well, guess what yo, fuck you right back

Oh, oh
Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh
Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh
Uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh
