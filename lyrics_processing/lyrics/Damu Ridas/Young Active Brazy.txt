Kill a coup' of Crabs - bust some coup' of raps
Niggas been snitchin' since the last L.P
Niggas on the streets acted like they trusties
My grandpop said: "Braze, you best to break that bitch"
That's why I flip the script and killin' with this gangsta shit
I heard you're scared to hold the strap
Your OG's mad
Cause my homies bust caps
And come right back (WOOP WOOP)
Hey f*ck, it don't freeze up
Bust it if you bee us
Bhakis suit with the Stars crease us
I'm used to the K-Swiss
Pendleton, bhakis, cap Frog off hats with the B on it, hit the big Fig
We the shit, you ain't heard of the Thunderbird
With the red lips, nigga f*ck the Rips
Lil' Yak with the mini Mac I hit 'em up
Hit and run: blaka-blaka!
Hit 'em up
I don't give a f*ck
Braze from the gang, I'ma do it
Where the heater at? Let me shoot it
Hell roll like some ?? it's me and T-man
Use to roll a G-man
It's ?? it up with the big B and... (WOOP WOOP)
Back the f*ck...
Back the f*ck 'fore I act the f*ck up...
Most of all I gots to clown your hoes
Split - diggin' in the hoes, swingin' off the foes
Bitches see the Vogues in the Hundred Spoke Gold
Where they hit the clubbers start like another hoes
It's all good I like them babies that be rockin' babies
Keep it real if you're dikin'
I've been pimpin' use to roll a Limo
Now I got a women hoe ?? up in my stable, ah
All upon the turntable tryinna find a label
Get out and bust and get rushed on sight
Brazy-Daze behind the mic keep dynanmite
Who else can bust with the B-Dawgs
I'm the nigga with the hold it now
Bump you down you in the ?? you best to bang now
You got your time gotta bang now
Back the f*ck...
Back the f*ck 'fore I act the f*ck up...
You out the module but you P.C.'d up
Red strings in your Chucks but you ain't gon' bust
Who to trust when it's time to roll
In a car or on the bike or on foot patrol
Fresh off parole
But I bickin' with the bangers Damu ??
On the thangs the Damu Ridin' bitches sayin' us
Nang-Nang
Knock 'em out
Nang-nang
Nigga stop 'em out
Crabs think take a tire about
I'm the nigga in the hoe since you got toasted up
Cherry slugs, chip ?? jaws, right up
Back the f*ck...
Back the f*ck 'fore I act the f*ck up
