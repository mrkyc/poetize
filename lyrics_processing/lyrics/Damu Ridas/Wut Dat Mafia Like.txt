I'ma claim my hood till I'm buried in mud
To you Crab motherf*ckers ain't no stoppin' me
Best be watchin' this
Young G it all time
I'm that lil' nigga that they call the creepy crawler, yes y'all
Y-G Spider from the Mafia
Flowin' and goin' to the top
But I live in the Bottoms
To say I got problems (C-K)
I got 'em
Now let me wreck or check the microphone
I'm a young Dog lookin' for my bone
Roaming strong through the I-N-G
Up Crenshaw with my nigga Bandini
Beamin', flamin', young G's bangin'
The next generation gonna do the same thangin'
If you're in the hood gon' be the first get caught up in the mix
Shaking 'em like dice ?? four leaf (aw shit)
'bout to go first verse done
Hot like the sun and fire like a gun, fool
S-P and Lil' Hawk with the flow that so tight
Hittin' you up West Side, wut dat Mafia like
We don't give a f*ck, we don't give a shit
Hit you up West Side, wut dat Mafia like
10-4 that's the intro on the next verse
I stomp you to the dirt
And make sure it hurt
That'll work
A young G representin' the B
Down with the C-K on C-K Century
Bangin' on the enemies, everybody's a danger
Everybody's stranger, one in the chamber
While I'm servin' and swervin', swoopin' and woopin'
On the O.G. West Side lootin' and shootin'
Scootin', gettin' the f*ck outta dodge
And smokin' them Crabs that be the job
Robbin' and stealin'
Killin' and chillin' in the hood
West Westside Inglewood
Motherf*ckers sucker lolly
Bitch-made
Who wanna get sprayed like some goddamn braids
Approach this like a ?? trick you die
Another C-M-G West Side C-K Ride
And it ain't over Blood, we still gettin' high
Way up in the sky wut dat Mafia like
S-P and Lil' Hawk with the flow that so tight
Hittin' you up West Side, wut dat Mafia like
We don't give a f*ck, we don't give a shit
Hit you up West Side, wut dat Mafia like
Special guest your request, motherf*cker, it's me
With my dog S-P, Lil' Hawk Y-G-B
Two riders that be
Gettin' they bang on
From 1-0-4
Aw, you didn't know? You can't f*ck - wit'
Me and my nigga from rappin' and scrappin', my finger's on the trigga
And how in the f*ck did you figure you don't wanna be me
The West Side Inglewood B-D-O-G, I got love
For - all my real niggas
All the cap peelers and all the Crab killers
C is for Crenshaw M is for Mafia
L if for Lil' and H is for Hawk
Taking 'em down and I'm breaking 'em down too
C-M-G to the B nigga, I thought you knew, but you
Didn't - so it's assed out when me and S-P in the motherf*ckin' house
S-P and Lil' Hawk with the flow that so tight
Hittin' you up West Side, wut dat Mafia like
We don't give a f*ck, we don't give a shit
