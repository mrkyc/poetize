Comin' right back at you nigga, it's the Hawkster
Nigga I ain't from Africa, I'm from Crenshaw Mafia
Gangsta no cut everytime that I'm flowin'
Ain't scared of you niggas
Just to let you know, so
What the f*ck do you bustas wanna do?
Flamed up, banged up shit nigga, I thought you knew that I'm a true
Young-ass muthaf*ckin' Gee
With more bounce to the ounce sending you up with a beat and
I'm not tryin' to get no punk-ass rapper
But when I catch your ass slippin' nigga it's on, on site
Tonight - I'll be
Hangin' on a bucket, pullin' up in a G-Ride
Dump 'em with a Glock on these niggas
Bitches everybody get shot
You should've been a Dogg but too bad that you not plot
Another murder homicide when I ride
I be smokin' niggas up so you know I stay high, it's do or die
With me Y-G Lil' Hawkster
Nigga I ain't from Africa, I'm from Crenshaw Mafia
Mad as f*ck, think about the payback...
West/Side C-M-G-B for life with me
On Crenshaw and Century the Mafia has made history
And even know punk niggas wanna do shit
We always stay down on this muthaf*ckin' streets, peep
My hood is over populated with G's
And I be hoppin' on planes flyin' way over sea's and
Every place that the young nigga been some
Muthaf*cka wanna get put on the M and shit
And never even seen where's at
But this nigga still down and pack a muthaf*ckin' strap or bust a cap
Nigga on the drop of a dime and
We don't give a f*ck about no bitch-ass One-Time
It ain't like you got a bulletproof punk
You ain't takin' me to jail
M and the L you gettin' your head blown
Into pieces - just like this
On the 104th street is why the crime rate increased
Can't f*ck with Lil' Y-G Hawkster
Nigga I ain't from Africa, I'm from Crenshaw Mafia
Mad as f*ck, think about the payback...
Ain't that about a bitch
They want me to turn in my strap
But a nigga like me on the B is sayin' f*ck that
Cause these niggas still want to blast
But when I'll catch their ass slippin' that's the muthaf*ckin' ass
I be blazin' niggas up just - like the thai hash, so
Don't be gettin' sparked' by this young sharp buddah and
It ain't no muthaf*cka callin' a cop
You sure stop with my Glock and you dead on the spot
Yellow tape
Red tag placed on your toe, these busta-ass niggas gotta go, gotta go, so
Hit the exit before I get to flex it
You can be black or
You can be a Mexican and
White boys gettin' knocked the f*ck out
Tryin' to step to a G, you get socked in your mouth punk
You can't f*ck with this young G-B
Kickin' up the most dust on this M-I-C, it's me
Your number one nigga Lil' Hawkster
Nigga I ain't from Africa, I'm from Crenshaw muthaf*ckin' Mafia
