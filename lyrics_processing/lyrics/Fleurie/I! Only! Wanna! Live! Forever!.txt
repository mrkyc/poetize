No time for summer in the city
But the girls, they feel like they could fly
And the sunsets look so pretty
But the boys, they feel like they could die

Tires in the sand, it's a love song
Wind ripping through my hand, it's a love song
Bet you never heard of this band, it's a love song
A love song

I only wanna live forever
You and me, we're gonna be together
If you wanted we could get out of the city tonight
I could see us in the desert in the moonlight
You and me, we're gonna live forever
Our names up in the stars together
If you wanted we could get out of the city
If you wanted we could, if you wanted we

Surf rock, I love you with a fire
Nobody knows that I'm alive
I hear you singing like a choir
Nobody else feels the rip tide
You might also like
Tires in the sand, it's a love song
Wind ripping through my hair, it's a love song
Bet you never heard of this band, it's a love song
A love song

I only wanna live forever
You and me, we're gonna be together
If you wanted we could get out of the city tonight
I could see us in the desert in the moonlight
You and me, we're gonna live forever
Our names up in the stars together
If you wanted we could get out of the city
If you wanted we could, if you wanted we

California girls don't look like me
I know that you love a mystery
Baby, tell me who you wanna be
'Cause California girls don't look like me

If you wanted we could get out of the city tonight
I could see us in the desert in the moonlight
You and me, we're gonna live forever
Our names up in the stars together
If you wanted we could get out of the city
