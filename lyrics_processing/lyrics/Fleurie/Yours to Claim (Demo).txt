You called today, I've been gone away
Praying that you're wishing that I'll come back this time
And stay inside this wire frame or have we become a cold cliche

High above the windows, looking down on rooftops
Beneath our heels, you say you're gonna let go
Is that what you want though, is that what you feel?

Say that you want me, say that you'll go
And say "I'll be back forever you know it bae"
Say you're my angel, say that you want my name
Forever in your brain, I'm still yours to claim

While you sleep, I sit up and dream
Wonder if you know you got me wrapped up
Like a bone between your teeth
I shiver like a falling leaf and it's right where I want to be

High above the windows, looking down on rooftops
Beneath our heels, you say you're gonna let go
Is that what you want though, is that what you feel?
You might also like
Say that you want me, say that you'll go
And say "I'll be back before you know it bae"
Say you're my angel, Say that you want my name
Forever in your brain
And we could climb mountains together
We could shout at the tops of our lungs
And see the world and there's nothing better than your love
Say that you want me, say that you'll go
And say, say you're my angel
Say that you want my name forever

Say that you want me, say that you'll go
And say "I'll be back before you know it bae"
Say you're my angel, say that you want my name
Forever in your brain
So you wanna let go, but baby I'm not done
I know that you're the one, so you wanna let go
