She's the happiest freak
Gets high on these beats
Dreams like Cinderella and she isn't scared to eat, oh
He's so cozy never gets lonely
Wears St. Laurent and a Rollie, Rollie

She's a garden, he's a loaded gun
Picked a flower like a hit and run, ah-ah
Started a war but nobody won
When he pulled that trigger

Sweetest honey, oh I think you're funny
Everybody talks but they don't say nothin', ah
They don't say nothin', ah
So you love me, oh you think I'm lucky
Everybody's sweet 'til they're running with the money, ah
'Til they're running with the money, ah

Oh, you make me blush
Slow rain in the summer
Oh, you make me blush
Slow rain in the summer
You might also like
Take a drive through the hills
I'm on my way down
Lights so bright there's no stars in this town
He makes pictures
Thinks it could fix her
Girl in technicolor so the world can't miss her

She's the muse, he's the mastermind
Raced the car past the warning sign, ah
Hit the cliff and the world was mine
When he pulled that trigger

Sweetest honey, oh I think you're funny
Everybody talks but they don't say nothin', ah
They don't say nothin', ah
So you love me, oh you think I'm lucky
Everybody's sweet 'til they're running with the money, ah
'Til they're running with the money, ah

Oh, you make me blush
Slow rain in the summer
Oh, you make me blush
Slow rain in the summer
(Mmm, ahh)
Slow rain in the summer
(Mmm, ahh)
Slow rain in the summer
(Mmm, ahh)

Sweetest honey, oh I think you're funny
Everybody talks but they don't say nothin', ah
They don't say nothin', ah
So you love me, oh you think I'm lucky
Everybody's sweet 'til they're running with the money, ah
'Til they're running with the money, ah

Oh, you make me blush
Slow rain in the summer
Oh, you make me blush
Slow rain in the summer

Oh, you make me blush
Slow rain in the summer
Oh, you make me blush
