I feel the magic
It's everlasting
I think that you were meant to be alive on this very night
With me
I see, it clearly
The dream you hear about
And never truly think its realistic till it blows your mind
I never thought i could understand
I was searching me
And now i finally see

I see that some people fight for love
They stick with it
Just can't quit it
Some people hide from love
They run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and its good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people fight for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you
You're the reason, the air I'm breathing
So don't go leaving
Cause loving you is the only thing that ever really touched my soul
I'm protective, of my blessings
Glad I kept it
I never really thought about the future till i saw my life
Finding it's purpose
So very worth it
And now I know that love is really worth it

They stick with it
Just can't quit it
Some people hide from love
They run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you
It's hard to be, and good to keep
And once you're with it, it's hard to leave
You can't help but run wild with imagination
It'll change you life from wrong or right
And then you'll touch, touch the sky
And now I don't see how I made it though the night
But I see how there's some people who fight
Some people fight for love
They stick with it
Just can't quit it
Some people hide from love
They run from it, cause they don't want it
When you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
And I believe it's true cause I'd do the same for you
Some people fight for love
(I don't wanna do it no more)
Some people hide form love
(It just feels so good)
But when you got a love and it's good like it should be
Makes you never wanna give it up
Cause you know that some people die for love
