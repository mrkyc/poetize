Must have been love drunk
Intoxicated with your love
But now I look around
Things just ain't the same to me
And I see it now
That you were not for me, yeah
I didn't have to do it
But I put all my heart in it
You said you loved me when you didn't
And you did it a-again, did it a-again
I didn't have to do it
But I put all my heart in it
Said you loved me when you didn't
And you did it a-again, did it a-again
After all that we been through
You still wanna let me down
I keep givin' it to you
You think I know by now
You would think I know better, better
Just by the way that you get down
You threw my heart like whatever
You would think I know by now
You might also likeSee the lies
See the tears that fall from my eyes
Wouldn't you think? Wouldn't you think?
First time around
I end up doing
You would tell a lie
And I could not see through it
But I look around
And you just ain't the same to me
And I see it now
That you're not the one for me, yeah, yeah
I didn't have to do it
But I put all my heart in it
You said you loved me when you didn't
And you did it a-again, did it a-again
I didn't have to do it
But I put all my heart in it
Said you loved me when you didn't
And you did it a-again, did it a-again
After all that we been through
You still wanna let me down
I keep givin' it to you
You think I know by now
You would think I know better, better
Just by the way that you get down
You threw my heart like whatever
You would think I know by now
You would think that I would get it
You would think I understand
But your lies keep me confused
Why'd you get another hint?
But don't worry I ain't stayin'
This is your game and I ain't playin'
'Cause I know
You don't really care for me
See the lies
See the tears that fall from my eyes
Wouldn't you think? Wouldn't you think?
You'd think I know by now
After all that we been through
You still wanna let me down
I keep givin' it to you
You think I know by now
You would think I know better, better
Just by the way that you get down
You threw my heart like whatever
You would think I know by now
After all that we been through
You still wanna let me down
I keep givin' it to you
You think I know by now
You would think I know better, better
Just by the way that you get down
You threw my heart like whatever
You would think I know by now
See the lies
See the tears that fall from my eyes
