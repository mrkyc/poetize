I can't help but noticing
Your fine as fine can be
And when you'e out there on the floor
Gonna break my neck to see
Tryin' to control myself
But it's hard as hard can be
I wanna to make my way to you eventually

'Cause baby, we can let the music play, oh
While we're waiting for a song you like
We can take it to the dance floor
Do whatever makes you feel alright

I'll make you dance
Dance all night
If you want me to
Just give me that chance
To make it right
We can find a groove
I'll make you dance
Dance all night

If you think I'm watching you
You're right as right can be
The way you move that thing around
Is a doggone sight to see
Can't stand to see you walk away
Sure love to watch you leave
I go to have my way with you definitely
You might also like
'Cause baby, we can the music play, oh

'Cause I'll make you dance
Dance all night

Just give me that chance
To make it right
We can find a groove
I'll make you dance
Dance all night
If you want me to, oh yeah
Just give me the chance
To make it right

Baby, if you wanna we can have a good time
Baby if you want it we can do it all night
