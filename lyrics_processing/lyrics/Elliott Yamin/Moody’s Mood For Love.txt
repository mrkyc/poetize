There I go, there I go
There I go, there I go
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing, but every time I'm near you
I never can behave

You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
Music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
(Turn) Turn me into your slave
Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything, baby, just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?

Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies
How I worry 'bout you, just can't live my life without you
Baby, come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?

So tell me why (Why) stop to think (Think)
About this weather, my dear?
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again
So baby, won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make you strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us, go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh, my baby, won't you please let me love you
And give me relief from this awful misery?
You might also like
Oh, baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come, let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a loving state of mind
I'm so crazy, mama
Never knowing what love isabout

And you can blow now if you want to
