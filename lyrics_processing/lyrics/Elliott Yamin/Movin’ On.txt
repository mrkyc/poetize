When I think about you baby, I can't help it (Help it)
I lose all my focus and I just can't stand it
I get so excited every time I hear your name (Your name)
And you don't reciprocate and it's a damn shame
Ohh

See all I'm trying to do girl is, is give you my time and
You know you better not move too slow 'cause I'm moving on
I'll take the chance and roll the dice
I might miss out on the love of my life

'Cause you know it as time moves on I won't always be around
And I'll be gone
And I won't always be down
'Cause I'm giving it up to you
And you know this much is true
As time moves on, consider me gone
Because I'm moving on

I know it sounds crazy, but I just can't do this (Do this)
It feels like we're wasting time so I'll get to it
When I look into your eyes I can see right through you (Through you)
And you don't feel the same way that I do
Ooh
You might also like
See all I'm trying to do girl is, is give you my time and
(Give you my time)
You know you better not move too slow 'cause I'm moving on, lady
I'll take the chance and roll the dice
I might miss out on the love of my life

'Cause you know it as time moves on, I won't always be around
And I'll be gone
And I won't always be down
'Cause I'm giving it up to you
And you know this much is true
As time moves on, consider me gone
Because I'm moving on

I'm telling you, you really missed out on a good thing for sure
As a matter of fact, I'm glad I didn't walk through that door
I'm a better man for it
Said I can learn from it or ignore it
You know I've seen it all before
Now your best friend's at my door

I'm moving on
Ooh (As time moves on)
Said I'm moving on (As time moves on)
Yeah
'Cause you know it as time moves on, I won't always be around
(No I won't)
And I'll be gone
And I won't always be down
'Cause I'm giving it up to you (No, no, no)
And you know this much is true
As time moves on, consider me gone
Because I'm moving on
I'm moving on, baby
I'm moving on, moving on
I'll be gone
