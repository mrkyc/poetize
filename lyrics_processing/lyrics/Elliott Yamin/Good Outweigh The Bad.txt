I kissed your lips and then you turned away
Do you only want to make me stay
Just to have me
Mmm...
It Seems Like Everyday is a situation
I used to think we were the perfect combination
I know you love me
But can you still say that you are happy?
Remember when I used to make you smile?
Now I'm feeling it's been a while
So I got to know the truth
Can we make it though?
Tell me what to do
Because I'm starting to ask myself
Does the good outweigh the bad?
Or are we better on our own?
Can we get back what we had?
Or is it time to let it go?
And it hurts to say but
Feels like we givin up
Baby we can make it
But we I think we need to ask ourselfs
Does the good outweigh the bad?

I call you up... YOUR ALWAYS ON THE OTHER LINE
Now I don't never say what's on my mind
Do you feel Me? can you feel me?
And girl I miss you when your not around
Cause your the sweetist thing I ever found
But I see it in your eyes
Somthings isn't right
Is it worth a fight?
Or are you starting to ask yourself?
Does the good outweigh the bad?
Or are we better on our own?
Can we get back what we had?
Or is it time to let it go?
And it hurts to say but
Feels like we givin up
Baby we can make it
But we I think we need to ask ourselfs
Does the good outweigh the bad?
And I know it's hard to imagine
After all that we been though
Should we say this shit or abandon?
I don't know what to doo...
Please tell me
Can we get back what we had?
Does the good outweigh the bad?
Can we get back what we had?
