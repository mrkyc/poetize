Yeah, since the last time that I held you
I can tell you've been crying, never thought to ask you why
Oh no, I never meant to hurt you
Is this the way that it goes when it's falling apart?
Maybe it's time to let go
'Cause what if the best is yet to come?
What if we're broke but not undone?
What if we're not what we've become?
How do I know? How do I know when it's over?
What if I'm wrong? What if we're hanging on too long?
I don't know which way to go
How do I know? How do I know when it's over? Ooh
How do I know when it's over? Oh oh
Pictures frozen in a frame
Love feels like a losing game
Oh, I miss the way I used to miss you
And I know I'll be all right without you in my life
Oh but I just can't say goodbye
'Cause what if the best is yet to come?
What if we're broke but not undone?
What if we're not what we've become?
How do I know? How do I know when it's over?
