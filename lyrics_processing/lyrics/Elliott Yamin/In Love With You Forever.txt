I'm gonna mind what my momma once told me
Don't fall in love if you can't fall all th ewway
She said go find yourself a dream girl give her every part of your world
Just hold on tight and never let her slip away
And when I saw you that rainy nigh tin Cleveland
You lit me up like the sun lights up the moon
And that feeling I felt then
Every day it comes again
Yeah it feels my heart completely
You mean everything to me

And I'm in love with you forever
I'm in love with you forever
I'm in love with you forever till I die
We're always going to be together
I'm never gonna leave you never
I'm in love with you forever till I die
Rain or shine
I am yours, you are mine

My mind don't change with the weather
It will stand through the wind and the hurricanes
All around we can see love ain't all it used to be
But that just make smy heart grow stronger
It just makes my love last longer
