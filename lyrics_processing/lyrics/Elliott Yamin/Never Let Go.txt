When you can't even look the one you love in the face
All you can think about is
What price are you're gonna pay
Everything i worked so hard for
I blew it away
Just for a moment
So how do i explain the tears you cry
Trading in your love for just one night
Sorry baby i apologize
Hoping that's enough to get me by
You ain't never know me to be like this
I was so weak could not resist
That it never happened would be my wish
I can't believe what i did
Why did i let go
Knowing you'd never do me the same
I should of just came home
But i didn't know how to leave
I left you alone
I did not mean to play with your heart
Girl.. should of never let go (never let go)
I dealt with the pain
Of the mess i made
And watching you walk away
Like it's crazy here without you
But you're not to blame, no
After finding you maybe i thought i could change
It lasted a moment
Now i can't even stop the tears i cry
Don't want to deal with this another night
What i did before i don't know why
When you're the one i needed in my life
You ain't never know me to be like this
I was so weak could not resist
I don't think i'm gonna get over this, no
I can't believe what i did

But i didn't know how to leave

Girl.. should of never let go (never let go)
Please i have control
Cos i.. baby i can't let go
I'm a better man then i showed ya
Just don't wanna believe that it's over
Cos every night and every day
I'm hoping that you're ok
Ohhh
You know it's hard to let go
Why did i let go
