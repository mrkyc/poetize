Picked up the phone and started to call
And that's when it hit me that you were gone
So many questions, things left unsaid
So much confusion going around in my head
And so many reasons that just don't make sense
Oh no
I try to carry on
But something's missing inside
I just wanna know if you're above me
Show me some kinda sign
Do you still hear me when I call your name?
Will you be with me when I lose my way?
When it gets hard let me know what to do
Oh yeah
You always told me that you'd never go
I need you to show me that I'm not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you?
Show me you do
How do I start to make sense of what's left
Still carry the memory of you in my head
And I'm just not ready to let you go yet
Oh no, oh
You might also likeBut I know you're proud of the man that I am
And that you would want me to go on ahead
And I'd give it all up to see you again
I try to carry on but something's missing inside
I just need to know if you're above me
Show me some kinda sign
Do you still hear me when I call your name?
Will you be with me when I lose my way?
When it gets hard let me know what to do
Tell me
You always told me that you'd never go
I need you to show me that I'm not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you?
Show me you do
I know that I'll see you someday, oh someday
I will see you again, I will see you again
Someday, oh someday I will see you again
