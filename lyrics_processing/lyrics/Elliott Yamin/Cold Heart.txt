'Causin' a commotion, I think about you all of the time
You know it's vicious, looking so delicious
Then you tell me he's suspicious, so I got to get you off of my mind
Don't try to cry to me, girl, I tried to tell you before
You made your bed and now you're gonna have to lie in it
I like the way that you move but I've got to watch what I do
If I ain't careful I might be the one who's playin' the fool
Baby, you got a cold, cold heart but a, a warm touch
Always gets you what you wanted, ooh yeah
I just can't get enough of this kind of dangerous love
I'll keep your number but I know you got a cold, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart, cold heart
Girl, you got a cold, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart, cold heart
Girl, you got a cold heart
You tell me that you wanna be my baby
Heaven, help me 'cause I love to have you every night
But I would be crazy callin' you my lady
When I see your love is shady and I know I'd be the next one in line
Baby, you got a cold, cold heart but a, a warm touch
Always gets you what you wanted, ooh yeah
I just can't get enough of this kind of dangerous love
I'll keep your number but I know you got a cold, cold heart
