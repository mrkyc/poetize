We're stuck at a dead end
And I'm starting to wonder
Did I say something wrong?
I keep asking the question
Will you turn around and come with me?
Or should I read the signs and leave
And let you be?
And now I'm standing at this roadblock
And there's no way around it
I've been waiting for your mind to change
'Cause it feels so one sided
I saw us break, I watched us fall
It made no sense to me at all
You say that you will but then you don't
So I'm gonna take this step alone
In my heart of hearts, I always knew
This jump was way too far for you
You say that you will but then you don't
So I'm gonna to take this step
I'm gonna take this step alone, alone
You might also likeSo give me a reason why you're on the outside
When you should be here?
We're no good together so maybe it's better
I'll walk alone but you'll always be near
Now there's no room for settling
I gotta do this, I need to, oh
But this mirror that I'm looking in
There's no reflection without you
'Cause I saw us break, I watched us fall
It made no sense to me at all
You say that you will but then you don't
So I'm gonna take this step alone
In my heart of hearts, I always knew
This jump was way too far for you
You say that you will but then you don't
So I'm gonna to take this step
I'm gonna take this step alone
The sanctity I found deep in your arms
It was a false alarm and it burns, yeah, it hurts
I lie awake at night
And think of what we could have been if it worked
Then we chose to go our separate ways
Instead of meeting each other half way
And if I had to choose, girl
I'd have you by my side
I saw us break, I watched us fall
It made no sense to me at all
You say that you will but then you don't
So I'm gonna take this step alone
In my heart of hearts, I always knew
This jump was way too far for you
You say that you will but then you don't
So I'm gonna to take this step
I'm gonna take this step alone, alone, alone
