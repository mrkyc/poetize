It's guaranteed, guaranteed to make your body move!
Now we don't need no radio station
And I don't want no standing ovation
I know you've been ? and you waited
For me to get down, oh
We'll get the whole damn town in this party
Everybody's getting in for free

Open bar, and you can be what you wanna be!
I said grab somebody, anybody
Get together, clap your hands and be
Let's do it like these are the best days of our lives
So, gather around like it's no tomorrow
Like you ain't got nothing that means
And bring your friends and family
You better make sure that the time is chosen
Now we ain't got no time for conversation
And it won't be no crazy altercation
Only electric relaxation
