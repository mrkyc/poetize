Hard for me - To eat
Losing sleep cause you're gone
& I can't do it alone
Since you can't be found
Hasn't hanging around
And I can't take it
I just can't do it alone
I've never thought to take it this far
Tell me how am I supposed to make it
Being here all by myself, just me
You're killing meeee
Ooh you broke my heart and left it wide open... dammmn
How can you be apart from mee
That's like trying to breathe with one lung
Or trying to live with no water
Just like a daughter with no father
That ain't the way it's supposed to be
How can you be apart from meeee, me, yeah (x2)
I can't hardly
Stand aside I was feeling weak
Cause you're gone
Why you wanna do this alone
You say you had enough
How you're gonna give up
Girl I'm missing the love
And I can't fake it yeah
And I don't wanna do this alone, no
You might also likeI never thought I could take it this far
Tell me how am I supposed to make it
Being here all by myself, just me
You know you're killing meeee
Ooh you broke my heart and left it wide open... dammmn
How can you be apart from mee
That's like trying to breathe with one lung
Or trying to live with no water
Just like a daughter with no father
That ain't the way it's supposed to be
How can you be apart from mee
Almost like the coldest only night
Without the stars up in the skies
I never saw this coming never
You know you're killing me
Ooh you broke my heart and left it wide open... dammmn
How can you be apart from mee
That's like trying to breathe with one lung
Or trying to live without no water
Just like a daughter with no father
That ain't the way it's supposed to be
How can you be apart from me
How can you be apart from me
How can you be apart from mee
