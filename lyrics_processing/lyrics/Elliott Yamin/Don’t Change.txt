Oh, oh, oh
Wish I had a dollar
For every time you said I'd never hurt you, ooh
You said you wanted love and romance
That was so far from the truth
Told me that my ex was a fool
But you're going through the same things
Should've never let you in that far
But now I know the type of girl you are
So don't change nothing about you
If they say that seeing is believing
Then don't blame me for leaving
So don't change nothing about you
You don't even have to lie, I've seen the light
My word of advice is don't change
Maybe it was me thinking
She'd understand I'm a good guy, oh
Tryna make her see I can be
What she needs in her life
(Needs in her life)
You might also likeWhat's crazy is it never even crossed your mind
What you could lose
How 'bout I make it easy for you to choose
Don't blame it on nobody else but you
So don't change nothing about you
If they say that seeing is believing
Then don't blame me for leaving
(Don't blame me, girl)
So don't change nothing about you
You don't even have to lie, I've seen the light
My word of advice is don't change
How could you do this?
I was there for you when no one understood
Stayed by your side, took care of you
When no one said they would
Gave all my time, my love
And asked for nothing in return
So tell me how do I get burnt over you
Over you
Oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, don't change
Oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, don't change
So don't change nothing about you
If they say that seeing is believing
Then don't blame me for leaving
So don't change nothing about you
You don't even have to lie, I've seen the light
My word of advice
Don't change nothing about you
(Don't ever do it, no)
You don't even have to lie, I've seen the light
