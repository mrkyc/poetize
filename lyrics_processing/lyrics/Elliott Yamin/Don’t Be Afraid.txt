I don't mean to bother you, I see you with your girlfriends
Wanna know if you got any plans for the weekend
Can I pick you up around 7? You let me know when
That's when she says she got a man
I don't see no ring on your fingers so what you sayin'?
Why your girls lookin' at you so crazy? C'mon, stop playin'
If it's not too much can I at least know what your name is
Girl, why you tellin' me you can't
Don't be afraid to fall in love
'Cause I don't believe in givin' up
Please give me a chance to earn your trust
'Cause I know I can be everythin' that you need
Don't be afraid to fall in love
And don't ever say that it's just too much
'Cause you never know, I could be the one
Girl, we're not all the same, baby, don't be afraid to love
You say that every man is lookin' for just one thing
You say they love you but they really don't know what it means
How can you think that way when you know nothin' about me
I say you're runnin' away
You might also likeI'll buy you nice things that I cannot pronounce
And if you let me love you, baby, I will turn you on
I'll stay committed and I promise I would be around
Your life will not be the same
Don't be afraid to fall in love
'Cause I don't believe in givin' up
Please give me a chance to earn your trust
'Cause I know I can be everythin' that you need
Don't be afraid to fall in love
And don't ever say that it's just too much
'Cause you never know, I could be the one
Girl, we're not all the same, baby, don't be afraid to love
If you try
It's not a waste of time
You will find
That love is what you need in your life
Just let it go
Nobody's gonna hurt you
Don't say no
Tell me what I need to do
To make you see
That you don't have to be that way
Just don't be afraid, ooh, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid to fall in love
Don't be afraid to fall in love
'Cause I don't believe in givin' up
Please give me a chance to earn your trust
'Cause I know I can be everythin' that you need
Don't be afraid to fall in love
And don't ever say that it's just too much
'Cause you never know, I could be the one
Girl, we're not all the same, baby, don't be afraid to love
