I admit it
I made choices that I never thought about
Guess I did it
For the pleasure
But I never
Thought this day would come around
And now I'm missing you
I miss kissing you
Oh, the smell of your perfume
And there's nothing now that I wouldn't do
And now I'm saying I'm sorry for all that I've done
I know I deserve it if you found someone
Don't know what to say to make you come back home
But I can't make you love me if you don't
I'm not perfect
That's for certain
I'm so used to people in and out my life
That's the reason
I didn't see it
'Til I missed you all those lonely nights
You might also likeAnd still I'm missing you
I can't believe were through
I've been actin' a fool
I'm still in love with you
And now I'm saying I'm sorry for all that I've done
I know I deserve it if you found someone
Don't know what to say to make you come back home
But I can't make you love me if you don't, if you don't
People say that I was a fool to let you go
When a woman's fed up she's not afraid to let it show
When her mind is made up the situation's out of hand
It might sound crazy baby, but I'm a changed man
And now I'm saying I'm sorry for all that I've done
I know I deserve it if you found someone
Don't know what to say to make you come back home
But I can't make you love me if you don't
I can't make you love me (if you don't)
I can't make you love me (if you don't)
I can't make you love me (if you don't)
