I kiss your lips then you turn away
Do you only wanna make me stay just to have me
It seem like everydays a situation
I used to think we were the perfect combination
I know you live me but can you still say that your happy
Remember when I used to make you smile
Now I'm feeling like its been a while
So I gotta know the truth, can we make it through
Tell me what to do cause I'm starting to ask myself
Does the good outweigh the bad? Or are we better on our own?
Can we get back what we had? Or is it time to let it go?
And it hurts to say it but feel like were giving up, maybe we can make it but I think we need to ask ourselves, does the good outweigh the bad?
Now we been showing all the tell tale signs
I call you up your always on the other line
Now I don't ever say what's on my mind, do you feel me?
Can you feel me?
And girl I miss you when your not around
Cause your the sweetest thing I ever found
But I see it in your eyes, something isn't right
Is it worth the fight or are you starting to ask yourself?
Does the good outweigh the bad? Or are we better on our own? Can we get back what we had? Or is it time to let it go?
And it hurts to say it but feel like were giving up, maybe we can make it but I think we need to ask ourselves, does the good outweigh the bad?
And I know it's hard to imagine, after all that we've been through, should we have this ship for abandoned, ooh, i don't know what to do
Please tell me, can we get back what we had?
Ooh, Does the good outweigh the bad? (does the good outweigh the bad?) Yeahh
Can we get back what we had? (ooh, can we get it back)Or is it time to let it go?
And it hurts to say it but feel like were giving up, maybe we can make it but I think we need to ask ourselves, does the good outweigh the bad? Oh, oh
Does the good outweigh the bad?
Can we get back we had? (can we get it back, hey, can we get it back?)
Or is it time to let it go?
