Like a drum inside my head
Baby, will you make it stop?
And I feel so separated from the truth
And everything she ever said
Could it all be for none?
Oh, how can she say to me it's over
When we've just begun
I gotta find a way to tell her
Girl, it's you that's been on my mind
'Cause you been gone too long
Girl, it's you, I wish I could fight
To ask you what went wrong
Girl, it's you and with you it's where
I know my heart belongs
Can't you see there is only one for me?
And girl, that's you, oh
Just another chance is all I ask of you
To show you how I feel
Did I get you way too much?
Oh, I kissed your lips, I felt your hips
And what we did, it felt so real
You couldn't say it wasn't love, oh oh

Girl, it's you that's been on my mind
'Cause you been gone too long
Girl, it's you, I wish I could fight
To ask you what went wrong
Girl, it's you and with you it's where
I know my heart belongs
Can't you see there is only one for me
And girl, that's you
Don't you wanna come back home?
Tell me why should love only be a dream
I don't know, I know you don't want to be alone
'Cause you're the one and you should be with me
Oh, ooh, I been thinking 'bout it and baby
Girl, it's you that's been on my mind
'Cause you been gone too long

And girl, that's you
There is only one for me
