Long as you keep on actin up
Takin me for granted, dammit
Like I'm a always be around
That's not goin down, oh no no
You gon miss me when I'm gone
Long as you keep on actin up
And I promise that you will never find another thatll treat you the way I do
You gon miss me when I'm gone
It's always about you and what you need never mind me
And no matter how much I put in I will never be
Good enough for you I think I'm gon
Have to cut you loose, hey
Complainin, whining and cryin bout this and that girl
What more do you want from me
I done gave you the world
But no more bread for you, shed no more tears for you
I'm good on lovin you I'm throwin up the duece
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Long as you keep on actin up
Takin me for granted, dammit
Like I'm a always be around
That's not goin down, oh no no
You gon miss me when I'm gone
Long as you keep on actin up
And I promise that you will never find another thatll treat you the way I do
You gon miss me when I'm gone
Girl what you cryin for I thought you wanted me gone
Keep lookin at the door thinkin I'm comin in
But my home ain't here no more (used to be)
What's mines no longer yours, hey
You still look confused it's
Players day find you another cat to play with
Said your apologies
And back up off of me
Think that your boy won't leave
I'll make you a believer
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Long as you keep on actin up
Takin me for granted, dammit
Like I'm a always be around
That's not goin down, oh no no
You gon miss me when I'm gone
Long as you keep on actin up
And I promise that you will never find another thatll treat you the way I do
You gon miss me when I'm gone
See for a minute I was thinkin it's me
Keep me guessin girl I'm stressin
Baby the way you got my mind
Keeps sendin me all the signs
When dammit you know I'm tryin to be a better man for you
Said you bendin over backwards tryna make it right
But you can say goodbye to that from now oh girl
You can wipe your own tears I hope I make it clear
You gon look up I'll be gone so chill out
And move on with your life
Don't know what else it is you want me to do
How many ways I can say it to you
When I would talk you ain't got nothin to say
But you be actin surprised if I ask for my 50 dates
So no more
I've been talkin girl you better fix it now
Cause when I'm out ain't comin back you can hang it up
You must think I'm playin
I thought I told ya
Better start listenin to me before I show ya
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Long as you keep on actin up
Takin me for granted, dammit
Like I'm a always be around
That's not goin down, oh no no
You gon miss me when I'm gone
Long as you keep on actin up
And I promise that you will never find another thatll treat you the way I do
You gon miss me when I'm gone
Hey, oh oh
You gon miss me when I'm gone
Oh oh
You gon miss me when I'm gone
Oh oh
Yea you gon miss me when I'm gone
Oh oh
You gon miss me when I'm gone
