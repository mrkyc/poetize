Saw you from a distance
Saw you from the stage
Something 'bout the look in your eyes
Something 'bout your beautiful face
In a sea of people
There was only you
I never knew what this song was about
But suddenly now I do

Try to reach out to you
Touch my hand
Reach out as far as you can
Only me, only you, and the band
Try to reach out to you
Touch my hand

Can't let the music stop
Can't let this feeling end
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over
I'll never see you again
Can't let the music stop
Until I touch your hand
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over
I'll never get the chance again
I'll never get the chance again
I'll never get the chance again
You might also like
I see the sparkle of a million flashlights
A wonder wall of stars (Stars)
But the one that's shining out so bright
Is the one right where you are

Try to reach out to you
Touch my hand
Reach out as far as you can
Only me, only you, and the band
Try to reach out to you
Touch my hand

Can't let the music stop
Can't let this feeling end
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over
I'll never see you again
Can't let the music stop (Oh no)
Until I touch your hand
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over
I'll never get the chance again
I'll never get the chance again

Saw you from a distance
Saw you from the stage
Something 'bout the look in your eyes
Something 'bout your beautiful face
Can't let the music stop
Can't let this feeling end
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over
I'll never see you again
Can't let the music stop
Until I touch your hand
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over (Oh)
I'll never get the chance again
I'll never get the chance again

Try to reach out to you
Touch my hand (I'll never get the chance again)
Reach out as far as you can (I'll never get the chance again)
(Reach as far as you can) Only me, only you, and the band
Try to reach out to you
Touch my hand
