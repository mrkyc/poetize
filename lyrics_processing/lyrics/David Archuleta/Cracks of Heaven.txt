I thought this empty house would be more quiet
But I can hear your voice whisper loud
I close my eyes and it's like
You're still here with me
Without you I thought it would be a ghost town
I was afraid that my heart would stop
It hurts from missing you
But what gets me through is knowing, knowing

I see you in the morning light
I see you in the midnight sky
I feel it everywhere around me
Never have to say goodbye
It doesn't matter where I go
I feel you in every memory
I hold them till I see you again
Through the cracks of heaven
Whoa Whoa Whoahh ooh
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoahhh
Heaven, Heaven oooh...
Through the cracks of heaven

I'm just a stranger on a street that's crowded
A thousand faces talking noise to me
Everyday's a fight
But it'll be alright
Cause I know, I know
You might also like
I see you in the morning light
I see you in the midnight sky
I feel it everywhere around me
Never have to say goodbye
It doesn't matter where I go
I feel you in every memory
I hold them till I see you again
Through the cracks of heaven
Whoa Whoa Whoahhh ooh
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoahhh
Heaven, Heaven oooh...
Through the cracks of heaven

It's the very first time we dance
The first time that I took your hand
Cuz in your eyes I found a piece of hope
I'm not alone...

I see you in the morning light
I see you in the midnight sky
I feel it everywhere around me
Never have to say goodbye
It doesn't matter where I go
I feel you in every memory
I hold them till I see you again
Through the cracks of heaven
Whoa Whoa Whoahh ooh
Through the cracks of heaven
Whoa Whoa Whoahh ooh
I hold them till I see you again
