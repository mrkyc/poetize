Fallin' out, fallin' in
Nothing's sure in this world no, no
Breakin' out, breakin' in
Never knowin' what lies ahead
We can really never tell it all no, no
Say goodbye, say hello
To a lover or friend
Sometimes we never could understand
Why some things begin then just end
We can really never tell it all no, no

But oh, can't you see
That no matter what happens
Life goes on and on?
So baby, just smile
'Cause I'm always around you
And I'll make you see how beautiful
Life is for you and me

Take a little time, baby
See the butterflies' colors
Listen to the birds that were sent
To sing for me and you
Can you feel me?
This is such a wonderful place to be
Even if there is pain now
Everything will be all right
For as long as the world still turns
There will be night and day
Can you hear me?
There's a rainbow always after the rain
Ohh, whoa
You might also like
Hittin' high, hittin' low
Win or lose you should go, yeah yeah
Gettin' warm, gettin' cold
Weather could be so good or bad
But baby this is life now don't get mad no, no, no

'Cause oh, can't you see
That no matter what happens
Life goes on and on
So baby, please smile
'Cause I'm always around you
And I'll make you see how beautiful
Life is for you and me

Take a little time, baby
See the butterflies' colors
Listen to the birds that were sent
To sing for me and you
Can you feel me?
This is such a wonderful place to be
Even if there is pain now
Everything will be all right
For as long as the world still turns
There will be night and day
Can you hear me?
There's a rainbow always after the rain
Life's full of challenges
Not all the time we get what we want
But don't despair my dear
You'll take each trial and you'll make it through the storm
'Cause you're strong
My faith in you is clear
So I'll say once again this world's wonderful and
Let us celebrate life that's so beautiful, so beautiful
Ohhh

Take a little time, baby
See the butterflies' colors
Listen to the birds that were sent
To sing for me and you
Can you feel me?
This is such a wonderful place to be
Even if there is pain now
Everything will be all right
For as long as the world still turns
There will be night and day
Can you hear me?
