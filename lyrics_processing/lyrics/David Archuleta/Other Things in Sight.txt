All you seem to say is get serious
Got me curious
Who it is that you think you're talking to
Think you've got control like a hypnotist
That's ridiculous
You gotta let go

Cause this is not your life
It's not your call to make this time

I just want a little more breeze
A little more ease
A little less people I can't please
Got other things in sight in mind
Give me a little more faith
A little more space
A little more room for my mistakes
Got other things in sight
I've got other things in sight in mind

All this breathing down my neck
Well it's gotta stop
Best be moving on
We're not getting anywhere like this
I'm not answering again
So don't ask me why
Try to justify
What I know is right
You might also like
Cause this is not your life
It's not your call to make this time

I just want a little more breeze
A little more ease
A little less people I can't please
Got other things in sight in mind
Give me a little more faith
A little more space
A little more room for my mistakes
Got other things in sight
I've got other things in sight in mind

I can see from a mile away
Well ain't this something
I've been waiting on this day
Live it up, live it up, live it up
I'm going my own way
Well ain't this something
You can come along or stay
Or give it up, give it up

I just want a little more breeze
A little more ease
A little less people I can't please
Got other things in sight in mind
Give me a little more faith
A little more space
A little more room for my mistakes
Got other things in sight
