Yeah, yeah, mmm, hmm

Everybody's got a time in their life
When everything hurts and nothing's right
But you gotta walk on, yeah, you gotta walk on
Everybody's got a piece of their heart
That's been stepped on and torn apart
But you gotta be strong, yeah, you gotta walk on

'Cause I know it's hard to have the strength and
Sometimes, you can't get through the day but
Things just float on by on that river in the night
But I know things are gonna get better
And I know things are gonna be fine
And I know life is gonna get better
Standing here together, yeah, we're gonna be fine

Everybody's got that one regret
No matter how they try, they can't forget
But you gotta move on, yeah, you gotta move on
And everybody's got someone they've lost
And they can't believe they're really gone
But you gotta live on, yeah, you gotta live on
You might also like
'Cause I know it's hard to have the strength and
Sometimes, all you feel is pain but
Time keep floating by on that river in the night
But I know things are gonna get better
And I know things are gonna be fine
And I know life is gonna get better
Standing here together, yeah, we're gonna be fine

And I've been shown hope
I see it in your eyes
So take me, touch me

'Cause with a little bit of love, we can win the fight
With a little bit of love we can see the light
With a little bit of love it'll be alright
I know things are gonna get better
And I know things are gonna be fine
And I know life is gonna get better
Standing here together, yeah, we're gonna be fine

Walk, walk, walk the line and
Keep, keep, keep walking on
