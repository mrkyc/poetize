Oooh yay-yay mmm

See how she's lookin' in my eyes
Any guy would kill for that
She's a beautiful girl and she's into me
But I'm too busy still lookin' back
Now I'm walkin' her to the door
Tryna kiss her good night
But something inside just don't feel right

My friends tell me, tell me give it up
So I've been tryna move on
But my heart still caught and my head's not clear
Of the pictures from before you were gone
And I never wanna hurt no one tryna forget your name
But something inside just don't feel the same

No, she's not you
And I don't know what to say
But I'll say it anyway
No matter what I do
I can't believe the lie
And I just can't see it through
No, she's not you

Woke up in the middle of the night
Started reachin' for the phone (aah)
Had to take a breath and remind myself
That you said you needed time alone
Didn't know what I wanted then
And I know I let you down
Baby, I know what I gotta do now, oh-ho-oooh

She's not you
And I don't know what to say
But I'll say it anyway
No matter what I do
I can't believe the lie
And I just can't see it through

She's not you when she smiles
Not you when she wakes
Or you when cries
Not you when she breaks
And I don't wanna hurt her
But I know that it's true
She's not you
Oh-ho oh woah, not you (not you, not you, not you)

No, she's, she's not you
I don't know what to say
But I'll say it anyway
No matter what I do
I can't believe the lie
And I just can't see it through
She's not you, yeah


No she's not you-ooooh
