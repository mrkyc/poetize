I was thinking about you
I drew a little picture
But some things you can't put on paper
I like you like shooting stars
I write songs on guitar
Got more things to do than stare at a mirror

And I know, I know
She's gotta be out there
Out there, I know, I know
She's gotta be...

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
Maybe I just let you walk by
What can I say
Maybe I've known you all my life
Is she the one? Is it today?
Will I turn the corner
See my future in a beautiful face
Maybe

She's anything but typical
A sweet surprise
No matter what, she's looking at the bright side
It's gonna be worth it
Cause that's what love is
I'll keep searching for my kind of perfect
You might also like
And I know, I know
She's gotta be out there
Out there, I know, I know
She's gotta be...

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
Maybe I just let you walk by
What can I say
Maybe I've known you all my life
Is she the one? Is it today?
Will I turn the corner
See my future in a beautiful face
Maybe

They say give it time
Give it time and it will fall in line
But I keep wondering how and when
And why I haven't met you

But maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
Ooh, woah, woah
Is she the one? Is it today?
Will I turn the corner
See my future in a beautiful face
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
Maybe I just let you walk by
What can I say?
Maybe I've known you all my life
Is she the one? Is it today?
Will I turn the corner
See my future in a beautiful face
Maybe
Oh, maybe
