I started a war
I sent out a battle cry
And I've been here before
Fighting me, myself, and I
When I try to prove that I'm never gonna lose
I push too hard, I push too far
Try to be brave 'til it's more than I can take
So many times 'til I realize

Take a breath
Look at how you're tryna think it to death
If you're in the crossfire, don't forget
That you don't have to be invincible
Take a step
Even if you fall, it ain't over yet
If you're in the crossfire, don't forget
That you don't have to be invincible
Oh-oh-ohhhhhh
Oh-oh-ohhhhhh (that you don't have to be invincible)
Oh-oh-ohhhhhh
Oh-oh-ohhhhhh (that you don't have to be invincible)

I counted to ten
I stepped back so I could see
How bad it can get
When I'm the enemy
I put my weapons down until I found
A better way, a better way
I'll never change if I'm too afraid to break
Got to let it go, let the whole world know to

You'll never know
You'll never know how strong you are
'Til you're strong enough to let your armor fall
Yeah...yeah...yeah
