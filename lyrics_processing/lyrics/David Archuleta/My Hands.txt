Ooh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh-oh, whoa
Ooh
Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa
Mmm

Accidentally, on purpose
I dropped my watch behind the tire
Threw my alarm clock inside the fireplace, yeah
And I put the parental control on
On the news and the weather channel
I'm outside in my robe
I'm looking for you, oh

If everything'd stop
I'd listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah
I tried every way I can

But it's harder to hold on to your hands than the hands of time
I need a hand, girl, I'm tryna hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
I'm tryna hold on
Standing here, open hands and I
Know I can't do this alone
Hold on, hold on
Baby, hold on (Hold on to my hands)
Can you hold on to my hands? (Don't let go of my hands)
Don't let go
You might also like
I don't think this is working
Reaching so hard, my hands are hurting
Oughta let go in the first place, yeah
And I put the phone on the front lawn
Everything that shows time is gone
I'm outside in this cold
Still looking for you, oh

If everything'd stop
I'd listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah
I tried every way I can

But it's harder to hold on to your hands than the hands of time
I need a hand, girl, I'm tryna hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
I'm tryna hold on
Standing here, open hands and I
Know I can't do this alone
Hold on, hold on
Baby, hold on (Hold on to my, my hands, oh)
Don't let go of my hands (Don't ever let me go)
Hold on to my (Oh), my hands, yeah
Don't let go of my hands (Oh)
If everything'd stop
I'd listen for your heart
To lead me right to you, yeah
I tried every way I can

But it's harder to hold on to your hands than the hands of time
I need a hand, girl, I'm tryna hold on
Losing strength in these hands of mine
I need you here
I'm tryna hold on
Standing here, open hands and I
Know I can't do this alone
Hold on, hold on
Baby, hold on (Hold on to my hands)
Can you hold on to my hands?
(Baby, hold on, don't let go of my hands)
Don't let go
(Hold on to my hands) Can you hold on to my hands?
(Don't let go of my hands)
Whoa, oh (Baby, hold on)
Oh-oh, (Hold on to my hands)
