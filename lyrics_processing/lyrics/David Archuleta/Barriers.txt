(Hey) Yeah
(Hey)
(Hey) Mmm

Well, I don't know how to say this right
And the words got me choking
I keep hitting this wall
It's never gonna fall
And we're still broken
This mountain we've been trying to climb
It's never ending
Just can't do nothing, gotta do something
'Cause if we don't open up our eyes
We're just pretending

Well, there's a time for giving up
Didn't wanna have to say it
All we're doing is building walls
And now there's too many barriers

Here we are, lyin' here
It's our last final goodnight
Just because it feels so good
No use pretending we're alright
Too many locks (Locks), too many crimes (Crimes)
Too many tears (Tears), too many lies (Lies)
Too many barriers (Barriers)
Oh-oh, just too many barriers
(Yeah)

Now we've been draggin' this whole thing out
(Draggin' this whole thing out)
But I can't wait any longer
Our love's burnin' down
Creepin' in the doubt, we're not gettin' any stronger
I hear you say that we're doin' okay
But, baby, I don't think so
Just can't do nothin', gotta do somethin'
'Cause if I don't get into my car
I won't go very far

Well, there's a time for giving up
Didn't wanna have to say it
All we're doing is building walls
Now there's too many barriers

Here we are, lyin' here
It's our last final goodnight
Just because it feels so good
No use pretending we're alright (We're alright)
Too many locks (Locks), too many crimes (Crimes)
Too many tears (Tears), too many lies (Lies)
Too many barriers (Barriers)
Too many barriers
Just too many barriers
That we keep running into
Been tryin', but we just can't break through
I know I'm gonna keep wishin' I was with you
But we just gotta stop

Here we are, lyin' here
It's our last final goodnight
Just because it feels so good (It feels so good)
No use pretending we're alright (we're alright)
Too many locks (Locks), too many crimes (Crimes)
Too many tears (Tears), too many lies (Lies)
Too many lies
In a hurry to get somewhere
And the road's tryna block ya, block ya (Just too many barriers)
And you feel like you're nowhere
'Cause the world's tryna stop ya, stop ya (Too many barriers)
In a hurry to get somewhere
And the road's tryna block ya, block ya (Just too many barriers)
And you feel like you're nowhere
