And just walk away from fucking everything
You'll be the walking dead
You'll be the walking dead
With our world around your neck
So, our advice to you is just keep running
Run from everyone and everything
What made you'd think you could put our name to shame?
Rest in peace is what they say
But how can you bury something that came from nothing;
Even though our dreams aren't dead?
And everyone who said we'd never do it, haha
Fucking spare me!
And I just can't let this one go, so let's set the story straight
We will be heard, no matter what the fuck it takes!
And I'll make you realize that you can place the blame
But you can't erase me from this game
Because as long as there's you, I'll do what it takes to prove we're still the same
So what the fuck are we waiting for?
It's time we stand up for ourselves
And if that doesn't make it clear enough
Then our friends are here to help
You might also like
We've been put down by everyone we thought we knew
But we're just fine here, cause we could never sink as low as you
The times have changed, the tables have turned
I thought you'd get the point by now, but I guess that you will never learn
So just look out for yourself, it seems to be your past time
So here's your ticket to Hell, it seems you missed it the last time
Welcome to Hell
We've been put down by everyone we thought we knew
But we're just fine here, cause we could never sink as low as you
The times have changed, the tables have turned
I thought you'd get the point by now, but I guess that you will never learn
So now it's our turn to speak
You'll have no choice but to hear us out
When we tell them about the truth
And how you tried so hard to sell us out
So just look out for yourself, it seems to be your past time
So here's your ticket to Hell, it seems you missed it last time
