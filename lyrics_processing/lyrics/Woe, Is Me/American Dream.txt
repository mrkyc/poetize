When you fall, find the strength in yourself to turn your life around
And rise
Rise back to the top
Im over working
Over stressing myself
All this time that I've wasted
Won't have to be wasted on you
I've learned to just trust myself
You can't believe everything you're told
Find yourself, make a plan and don't just wait around for things to unfold
Second chances don't come easy and they fade so fast
Pick up where you left of and bury the past
I've buried everything and everyone I've ever known
No turning back now, this all I've ever known
No turning back now
We're all in this together
Got to keep control
No room for mistake
To every motherfucker
Who tried to bring me down
To every sorry fuck
Who had no faith in me
To every fake piece of shit
Who said I'd amount to nothing
You've all helped me succeed
In my American Dream
You might also likeWhat! What!
To every motherfucker
To every sorry fuck
To every fake piece shit
I'm so over it
You can't believe everything you're told
Find yourself, make a plan and don't just wait around for things to unfold
Second chances don't come easy and they fade so fast
Pick up where you left of and bury the past
You can't believe everything you're told, don't wait around for things to unfold
Find yourself, make a plan
Find yourself
We've come too far to sell ourselves short
And become what they want me to be
I'll never be what they want me to be
We've come too far to sell ourselves short
And become what you want me to be
I'll never be what they want me to be
Step away from the path
Break away from conformity
This is my life, this is my time to shine
This is my life
Fuck who you want me to be
