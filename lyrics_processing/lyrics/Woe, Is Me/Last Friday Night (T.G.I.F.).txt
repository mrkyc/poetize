There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding my head
Bottles all over the room
Some stripper's clothes are in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue
Is this a hickie or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
And it's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure, it ruled

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa-oh-oah
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

T.G.I.F
That's when we party the most
So raise your hands for a toast
T.G.I.F
That's when we party the most
Get down with us!
MOVE!
This is how we party on a Friday night!
Bring the girls, bring the guys
And Let's set this shit off right
The parents aren't gonna be home tonight
So put your feet to the beat
And get the fuck up!
