But in the end, we won't give in 'cause it's just who we are
I still have so much left to say
So my best advice to you is stay the fuck out of our way
We will never back down, never give in
No matter what it takes always believe in;
That when you swallow your pride and put all shit aside
We'll be the ones standing in the end
When you hit the road, you left without wasting any time
You remembered your clothes, but left your spirit behind
And at night when you're alone inside your head
Don't pray for sympathy, no, pray for a miracle instead
You're feeding me excuses and they're making me bitter
Don't raise a fuss, just keep it up 'cause no one likes a quitter
Just when you had us all figured out
There's always one thing you forget about
So we'll teach you a fucking thing or two
Of what it means to see shit through
We'll stand our ground!
Right here, right now;
With our friends all behind us
And this vengeance inside us
We will tear you down!
You might also like
Your promises are a hollow shell
I look for the truth, your lies won't fulfill
Past your answers aside of me
You can't put a price on my dignity!
Bury your motives, bury your pride
Bury your motives, bury your pride
Bury your motives, bury your pride
We are the dreamers
Your feet is groundless
We are the dreamers
Your feet just stand back
Someone once told me that time is gold
So don't sit and watch it all disappear
Because these dreams you hold can never be sold
These dreams are what brought us here
So fuck everyone else, just believe in yourself!
So find your place, no time to waste
