And I think you've just about lost
Your sense of self, your sense of self
And your foundations are crumbling down
Are crumbling down, eh

I told you so, told you so
Don't be the one to say you know what's right
I told you so, told you so
Don't be the one to say you know my heart
Don't be, don't be torn from your roots
You won't live in this pursuit
You won't survive above this ground
It won't be long until you're home bound

Stop pretending, drawing the lines
You're not concerned about me
I'm losing confidence, why do you show no mercy?
Stop pretending, drawing the lines
You're not concerned about me
I'm losing confidence, why do you show no mercy?

These branches are burning
These branches won't pull me down
Back to the ground
Where I am standing safe and sound

Who are you (Who are you)
To tell us who we are? (Who we are?)
Who are you (Who are you)
To tell us who we are? (Who we are?)
Who are you? You're a fiend, you're a liar
And I will summon the hands of a fighter
And you will know who we, know who we are
Who are you? You're a fiend, you're a liar
And I will summon the hands of a fighter
And you will know, and you will know
Who are you? You're a fiend, you're a liar
And I will summon the hands of a fighter
And you will know who we, know who we are
Who are you? You're a fiend, you're a liar
And I will summon the hands of a fighter
And you will know, you will know

You say you know who I am
You'll only bring me down (You'll only bring me down)
Bring me down
You left me cold at home (You left me)
To fight the foundation and the walls are crumbling down
You say you know who I am
You'll only bring me down (You'll only bring me)
Bring me down (You left me)
To fight the foundation and the walls are crumbling down
