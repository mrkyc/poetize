No one ever said this life would come easy
For God's sake, you just have to believe me
I will go until the floor breaks beneath me
So place your bets, this shit won't be easy
Go!
Why believe all the shit they said?
This isn't over until I'm fucking dead!
So I'll let you keep your fame, while we all still stay the same
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
And you don't have the backbone that everyone believes you do
So go ahead and talk your shit, I'll give you a reason to
How does it feel to think so highly of yourself?
And it's like they always say that the past will find you
'Cause karma is a bitch, it only comes back to remind you
And after all of this time you will be put in your place
I just hope that I'm around to see the look on your face
'Cause you see, the one main difference between you and me
Is that in this world where nothing comes for free
I know what the fuck I'm fighting for!
You might also likeBring your war
'Cause I think it's time that we settle the score
And while you're at it tell me what the hell it takes
To turn someone that I love into someone that I hate
So before you make that bright mistake
Of standing up for a two-face snake
I hope you learn by the words in the song
That it's been us here for you all along
Say whatever you need to say
But make sure you choose your words well
And if you suddenly find yourself speechless
I'll give you a story to tell
I've come through hell and back to prove myself and put your words to shame
And by the time that this is all said and done
You may not understand, but you'll sure as hell remember our name
Say whatever you need to say
But make sure you choose your words well
You don't have the backbone that everyone believes you do
