So hold these words up to your chest
Prove to them all why you're the best
And when they say you're just like the rest
It's time to put that courage to the test
So do your very best to tear them down
Until there's nothing left
And while you're dwelling on the past
We'll see who's laughing last
You've said enough for both of us, so don't try to deny it
And some things are better left unsaid, but I can't keep this quiet
Well I'm not one to hold a grudge and hide it from the surface
Cause every single thing I've ever held against you has a purpose
You're good at starting problems for the hell of it
But our difference is that I don't use my past to make me feel relevant
I've told you once and I'll tell you twice
That everything comes with a price
And after all the things you said
You should've known how this would end
I've told you once, I'll tell you twice
That everything comes with a price
Well you rolled the dice and now tough luck kid
We're all pissed off, with no fucks to give
You might also likeCause you say that we're cowards
And that we're the ones to blame
But we're one in a million
And you're all the fucking same
You're so proud of the one-liners you wrote
It must be hard to talk shit with a dick in your throat!
Let's take it back to the top
Whether you're ready or not
You knew that we'd never stop
So bring the best that you got!
Maybe this is too much for you, whoa
But how dare you even try to
Take my words and turn them inside out
To hide the fact that all your luck ran out
Well, who the hell gave you the right to tell me how to live my life?
And when you said enough is enough
I fought to keep going when the going get tough
You might think you've got me tricked, but you're not hard to see through
