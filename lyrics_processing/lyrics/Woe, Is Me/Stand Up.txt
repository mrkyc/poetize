This is the beginning of a new lease on life
This freedom, this passion is how we survive
Only got one life one chance
To show what I got and nothing will ever
Take this from me
You can never take this from me

Whatever happened to just wanting to live your dream
When no one cared about the cover of a magazine
This is the price I pay for the life I've made
But I'm always finding a way to stand up
Can't you hear the sound of
A thousand screaming voices
Eager to watch you succeed?
Give them something real to believe

You'll try everything
To sell your soul for a quick buck
So look at it this way
Tried to control my life, but I've got something to say
Your words, they make me sick
Mind-blown by all the constant bullshit
Go back to your pathetic life and let me be
You might also like
Whatever happened to just wanting to live your dream
When no one cared about the cover of a magazine
This is the price I pay for the life I've made
But I'm always finding a way to stand up
Can't you hear the sound of
A thousand screaming voices
Eager to watch you succeed?
Give them something real to believe

This is a song for the times I've failed
This is a song for the times I got it right
Maybe I'm just a boy with a dream
But my dreams are becoming a reality
This is a song for the times you've failed
This is a song for the times you got it right
Maybe you're just someone with a dream
But your dreams are so close, you just have to believe it

Stand up, can't you hear the sound
Of a thousand screaming voices?

Whatever happened to just wanting to live your dream
When no one cared about the cover of a magazine
This is the price I pay for the life I've made
But I'm always finding a way to stand up
Can't you hear the sound of
A thousand screaming voices
Eager to watch you succeed?
