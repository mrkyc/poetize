Your opinion means nothing
Your words are shallow and you'll get what you deserve
Isn't it funny how life works in such mysterious ways, mysteriously
All my life, I've been waiting for this moment to live free and be me
All my life, I have always fallen short but not this time
All my life, I've been waiting for answer, all my life
You couldn't stop me even if you wanted to
It's plain to see, I wanna be
A voice of hope
Not the voice of a dying breed
Finally I'm doing what I wanna do
I've never felt so free in my whole life
There's nothing I would trade for
This is what I was made for
I won't be held back by failure
It's easy to lose yourself completely
To become your own worst enemy
Yeah, yeah
Don't try to tell me how to live my life
Don't try to justify what's wrong and what's right
You might also likeLets put it this way
I've been doing this for far too long
To give up everything I've worked for
I've made my deals and cut my losses
For you it's all about the money
For you it's all about the fame
And how you play the game
You couldn't stop me even if you wanted to
It's plain to see, I wanna be
A voice of hope
Not the voice of a dying breed
Finally I'm doing what I wanna do
I've never felt so free in my whole life
There's nothing I would trade for
This is what I was made for
Cause at the end of the day
We're all just trying to make a way
For ourselves
And I'm giving everything that I have left inside of me
Your words are meaningless
Cause I'm above the negativity
So take these words and hold them close
