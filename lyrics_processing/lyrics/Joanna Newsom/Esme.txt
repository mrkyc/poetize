I can feel a difference
Today, a difference
All of us in our tents
Fearing God like a mistress

We lay on the rocks in the sun
Watching you and your mama row in
I sat up and blinked when you appeared
So pale you were nearly clear

Later, I stumbled to my bed
All alone in the branches
I laid in the dark thinking about all
Of my friends and their changes

And I do not know if you know
Just what you have done
You are the sweetest one
I have ever laid my eyes upon

It's a beautiful town with the rain coming down
Blackberry, rosemary, Jimmy-crack-corn
You've got the run of the place now that you're running around
And may kindness kindness, kindness abound
You might also like
In this hour of our lives
Hour of effortless plenty
How do we know which parts of our hearts
Want what with such base generosity?

Taking so many photographs, so amazed!
We've never seen a baby so newly-born
And when the bulbs do flash as bright as morning
The crowd keeps on gathering like an electric storm

The phantom of love moves among us at will
Each phantom limb lost has got an angel
So confused like the wagging, bobbed tail
Of a bulldog, kindness, kindness prevails

Kindness prevails, ties and rails, ties and rails
Fall into line, bearing kindness
Where will you go, if not here?
What will you say when you write to us?

And this is a world of terrible hardship everywhere
And I search for words to set you at ease
But there in the looking-glass, a kite is soaring
Stilling my warring heart and my trembling knees
Clean as a breeze, bright as the day
All of the people gather to say
"Sweet Esme, sweet Esme!"
Oh, oh, oh

I believe love will always surround you
Brave as a bear with a heart rare and true
But if you are scared, if you are blue
I have prepared this small song for you

Sweet Esme, sweet Esme
Oh, oh, oh
Sweet Esme, sweet Esme
Oh, oh, oh
Sweet Esme, Esme
Sweet Esme, sweet Esme
