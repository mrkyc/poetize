We picked our way down to the beach
Watching the waves dragging out of our reach
Tangling tails, like a sodden sheet
Dangling entrails from the gut of the sea

Hoarding our meals, alfalfa and rolls
Trying not to catch the cold eye of the gulls
I hope Mother Nature has not overheard
Though she doles out hurt like a puking bird

La-la, la la la, la-la, la la la
La-la, la la la la, la la la la la
La-la, la la la, la-la, la la la
La-la, la la la la, la la la la la

We stayed for the winter
No one told us about the laws of the land
I hold my own, but you, with your hunger
You, on the other hand, make yourself known

And when we were found, I know we both grieved
My heart made the sound of snow falling from eaves
You and me, Bess, we was as thick as thieves
So I swore, nonetheless, up and down, it was only me
You might also like
So they took me away, and after some time
Studying my case must have made up their minds
By the time you realized I was dying
Must have been too late, I believe you were not lying

La-la, la la la, la-la, la la la
La-la, la la la la, la la la la la
La-la, la la la, la-la, la la la
La-la, la la la la, la la la la la

It is the day I wake with my ears cocked up like a gun
Like every day, of course
Yanked by my wrists to the sugar-front court yard
Now tell me, what have I done?
Seems I have stolen a horse
And I step to the gallows
Who do you think that you are, arching your hooves like a crane
In the shallow gutter that lines the boulevards?

Crowded with folks who just stare as I hang, it's all the same
Kindness comes over me, what was your name?
It makes no difference, I'm glad that you came
Forever I'll listen to your glad neighing
La-la, la la la, la-la, la la la
La-la, la la la la, la la la la la
La-la, la la la, la-la, la la la
