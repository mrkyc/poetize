Easy, easy, my man and me
We could rest and remain here, easily
We are tested and pained by what's beyond our bed
We're blessed and sustained by what is not said

No one knows what is coming
Or who will harvest what we have sown
Or how I've been dulling and dumbing
In the service of the heart alone

Or how I am worn to the bone by the river
And, in the river made of light
I'm your little life-giver
I will give my life

Haven't you seen what I've seen?
Don't you know what you ought to do?
I was born to love
And I intend to love you

Down in the valley where the fields are green
Watch my luck turn fro and to
Pluck every last daisy clean
'Til only I may love you
You might also like
I am easy, easy to keep
Honey, you please me, even in your sleep
But my arms want to carry, my heart wants to hold
Tell me your worries. I want to be told

Sit and see how the fog from the port in the bay
Lays like snow at the foot of the Roanoke
Hear the frog going courting
'Til the day he croaks

Saying even then how there is light in the river
And there's a river made of light
C'mon, you little life-giver
Give your life

Who asked you, asked you
If you want to be loved by me?
Who died and made you in charge of who loves who?
All the livelong day, if I have my way, I will love you

But One can't carry the weight
Or change the fate of Two
I've been waiting for a break, how long's it gonna take?
Let me love you
How about it?
How about what I have to say?
How about that livelong day?
How am I gonna stay here without you?

Easy, easy, you must not fear
You must meet me, to see me, I am barely here
But like a Bloody Mary seen in the mirror
Speak my name and I appear

Speak my name and I appear
