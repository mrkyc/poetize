There is a spring not far from here
The water runs both sweet and clear
Both sweet and clear and cold
Could crack your bones with veins of gold

I stood, a-wagging at the tap
Just a-waiting on the lagging, rising sap
I held the cold tin ladle to my lip
At the Shrine of the Thousand Arms, I lowered my eyes to sip

What a beautiful day to catch my drift or be caught up in it
You want your love, love?
Come and get your love
I only took it back because I thought you didn't

How my ears did ring at the municipal pound
From that old hangdog to which I was bound
Curled 'round the bottom rung, doesn't nobody want you?
Well, come on, darlin', I could use someone like you around

I am not like you, I ain't from this place
And I do reserve the right to repeat all my same mistakes
And in the night, like you, I certainly bite and chew
What I can find and never seem to lose the taste
You might also like
What a horrible face I feel me make
For Pete's sake, what you have told me, I cannot erase
(Though I keep on saying
And I do believe it is not too late)

All day, you're hassling me with trifles
Black nose of the dog as cold as a rifle
Indicating, with a nudge, God, no God, God, no God
Sweet appraising eye of the dog
Blink once if God, twice if no God

My mama may be ashamed of me
With all of my finery
Carrying on, whooping it up 'til the early morn
Lost and 'lorn among the madding revelry
Sure, I can pass, honey, I can pass
Particularly when I start to tip my glass
I'll be a sport and have a go at that old song
Singing unabashed, 'bout them city girls
With their ribbon bows and their fancy sas'
But, though I get so sad, could swear the night
Makes a motion to claim me around that second verse
I reckon I've felt worse
And still held fast
But, later on, when I am alone, alone at last
Well, I take my god to task
