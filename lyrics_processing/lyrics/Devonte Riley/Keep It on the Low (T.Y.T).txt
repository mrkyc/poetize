Take your time baby
That's all you really need to do
We can't go around
Giving all of our friends a clue
We gotta' keep it low
And I hope you understand
Cause' I don't wanna' cause problems
Between you & your man
I got a thing for you baby
And I can't let go
And it's important that I tell you this
Because you really need to know
Just take your time baby

Take your time baby
It'll be alright baby
And don't you worry
We'll be in a hurry
Take your time baby
It'll be alright baby
And won't nobody have to know
We can keep it on the low (yeah)

Coming over to my house
Whenever me and my homies are around

To follow through with my plan
Cause' I don't wanna' cause problems
Between you & your man
I got a thing for you baby
And I can't let go
