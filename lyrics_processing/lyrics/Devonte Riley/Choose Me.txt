I discovered you
With another dude
On Instagram
I could not believe
What I seen
It was so cruel (yeah)
And I don't understand, why I keep putting myself
Through these situations
The pain and the sorrow
But I guess I'll have to realize
That you will never be mine
All you did was tell me lies
I should've never gave you the time

Why didn't you choose me
You are the one that I love
Why didn't you choose me
You're the one I'm thinking of
Why didn't you choose me
You're the one I need in my life
Why didn't you choose me
Girl you know I'll treat you right
Tell me baby
Why didn't you choose me

Now I checked your profile to see
If my eyes were being true to me
I was not mistaken
You're definitely taken
And theres nothing I can do
My mind's telling me to be strong
You can do better and move on
If you wanted to be friends
You should've opened your mouth
(Your mouth), (your mouth)
You mislead me
Friend-zoned me
What more can you /
Do to break my heart
Betrayed me
Persuaded me that
We should be friends

Why didn't you choose me
You are the one that I love
(You are the one that I care about)
Why didn't you choose me
You're the one I'm thinking of
(He don't even care about you)
Why didn't you choose me
You're the one I need in my life
(And he can't treat you good)
Why didn't you choose me
Girl you know I'll treat you right
Tell me baby
Why didn't you choose me
Now you may get to thinking that my thirst is real
I just want to show you how I feel (yeah)
If you only knew, the pain I was going through
(Pain I was going through)
I spent many nights in my room
Trying to figure out what I did wrong to you
Never did you
Give me a chance to be that man
That you know I could be (yeah)
I could be the man for you
Girl I won't lie and you know it's true
I can be that man for you, baby
I'll be the man for you
