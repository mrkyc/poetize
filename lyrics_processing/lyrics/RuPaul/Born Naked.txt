Who you waitin' for? Another savior
Always lookin' but you never find, never find
Wakin' up from another night gone
Always lookin' but you never find, never find

Goin' downtown, you know where you goin'
Throw ya top down like you know where you goin'
Tell me one thing, do you like where ya goin'?
Runnin' all the red lights

And I said, oooh
Who do you think you are? (Uh-uh)
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag
Who? Who do you think you are? (Uh-uh)
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag

A lonely highway, you drove the wrong way
Always chasin' down a fantasy, a fantasy
A sexy muscle car under the radar
Always lookin' but you never see, never see
You might also like
Goin' downtown, you know where you goin'
Throw ya top down like you know where you goin'
Tell me one thing, do you like where ya goin'?
Ignoring all of the signs

And I said, oooh
Who do you think you are? (Uh-uh)
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag
Who? Who do you think you are? (Uh-uh)
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag

I'll say it again
It's never been the clothes that make the man
Nothing can
Leave all ya baggage behind

And I said, oooh
Who do you think you are? (Uh-uh)
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag
Who? Who do you think you are? (Uh-uh)
Who do you think you are?
I'm tellin' the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag
We're all born naked and the rest is drag
Let me tell you the truth!
Who do you think you are?
I'm telling the truth now
We're all born naked and the rest is drag

Talkin' 'bout you are born naked and the rest is drags
