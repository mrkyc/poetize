This groove is for my girls, little lady boys and girls
Nobody rocks like the girls I'm running with
Sitting on a secret and everybody's in on it
Some girls talk to the boys in the chat room
My girls talk to the boys in the back room
Hit me up, I'm that chick you know
That my world won't stop if you clock me
You got me oh oh oh oh oh
You got me going oh oh oh oh

One more shot, I got another boogie and I gotta
Move my feet 'cause the beat don't intimidate me
If you wanna dance, I'm the girl with something extra
If you wanna dance, you'd better put it on me mister

That my world won't stop if you clock me
You got me oh oh oh oh oh
