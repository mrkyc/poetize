Good evening, everybody
I'm so happy y'all was up in here
My name is Miss Valerie Valentine
And I'll be your hostess and MC for this evening
How's everybody doing?

Kiss me like you miss me
Hump me like you hate me
Shoot a movie on my face
Take another picture
Put it on my Insta
C'mon, give me another taste

Scamming money, don't make no money
But freaky money, do get the money
Cause freaky money, do get the money
Cause freaky, freaky

Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!
(Freaky!)
Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!
(Freaky!)
All up in the club, I'm making
(Money, money, money, money!)
Walking down the street, I'm making
(Money, money, money, money!)
When I shake my ass, I'm making
(Money, money, money, money!)
Even when I sleep, I'm making
(Money, money, money, money!)

Mastercard or Visa
Very nice to meet ya
Just relax and have a seat
Checkin out my NASDAQ
While you lick my snack pack
I'm an ATM machine
But right now please pause
And put your hands together for the complex talents
Of whoever ignant ass is supposed to get up here
Do we have somebody, Charles?
Can someone work the lights up in here?
You hold your head high, you dizzy bitch
You got paid!

Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!
(Freaky!)
Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money!

(She want that money money, I want that money money)
Big Freedia, better known as Queen Diva
Cute features, hair long like Mona Lisa
Pockets full, I don't need to use my Visa
A lotta freaky money when I'm booking out arenas
Hoes shaking, money making, ass everywhere
Toot it up, bend it over, gone grab a chair
Make it work, make it twerk, Imma take you there
If you ballin' throw your freaky money in the air

Don't give me your love
I don't want it (Throw it up now!)
