Oooh
Kitty Power
Back in your stereo
Oooh
Meow, bitch!
Let's do this girls!
Sitting on a secret!

Oh, you didn't know, it hangs to the floor
Got it snatched back tight, so you can't see it
It's a big old thang, you know what I mean
Gagging all the kids with my secret

I'm a certain kind of girl that's walking art
I'm so fierce baby, and that's just the start
Boys love me especially
'Cause I got the same parts as Miss Tati
Girls like me on All Stars 3
No innuendo here, it's what you see
I make my own choices and love to be free
I choose both bathrooms when I gotta go pee
(1, 2, 3, yeah!)

Sitting on a secret
Promise that you'll keep it
And we won't tell no one!

Go ahead and pass me the mic
Let me show you how to do it right
Let me show you how to level up your puss
In the middle of a kitty cat fight
Got a secret bigger that Alyssa's
Wanna pet my little kitty and kiss her?
Banji queen, got my baby hairs slicked
Don't gotta say shit, just lick my secret!

Move that body, work up a sweat
I got a workout that you will not regret
Lunge down low, come on Ru!
Squeeze that tush and whoo!
*Gasp, gasp* You want more?
If you really, REALLY wanna workout your core
Take that secret, put it on the floor
Disappear in 1, 2, 3

Sitting on a secret
Promise that you'll keep it
And we won't tell no one!
If you say you're super smart, you're not
If you say your drag is art, it's not
If you say you didn't fart, you did
I'm not joking, kid
I am Milky, so start lapping
Fun with rhymes, they call that rapping
We the Kitty Gurlz, hear us roar
Honey, there's the door, ow!

Sitting on a secret
Promise that you'll keep it
And we won't tell no one!

Sitting on a secret
Promise that you'll keep it
And we won't tell no one!
