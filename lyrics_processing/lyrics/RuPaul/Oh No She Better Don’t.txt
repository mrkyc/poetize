Oh no she better don't
(Yes, honey)
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no- It's the Ru-Tang Clan!

It's your girl Joslyn, and I'm the fox
Heads turn, necks break
When this bitch walks
Always keep my nose clean
But for me the boys fiend
Try me, bitch
I'm a mother-fishin' drag queen

Well, this is DeLa to the Creme
I'm the fatal femme
But I got the candy coatin'
So they call me Creminem
That's cream en Francais
Voulez want to couche?
Avec four fly ladies who'll be comin' your way

Check it
Let's take a second to see how this goes
Rhinestones, big hair, gown to the flo'
Tonight I'm gon' make history
Don't even try to come for me
My flow is such a mystery
I am your girl, T.K.B

Never been the in-girl since she came out
Milk shudders in her udders
We're the easy way out
If you're lookin' for a dude
Or in the preggers mood
Milk is in the house
And them other bitches rude!
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
(Uh!)
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
(Yes, honey)
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
(Uh! Uh!)
Oh no she better don't
Oh no- Panty Hoes!
Laganja's on the track and y'all can't handle me
I'm bustin' through the door and smokin' on that tree
Panty Hoes and control top D
Givin' you body, you're all livin' for me

Big girl, why you all in bare feet
Walkin' down the dirty city street?
Keep your shoes on, honey
To make that money
'Cause your toenail dragging
And that sure ain't funny!

My name is Bianca, I'm from the deep south
All them bitches can't handle my sassy-ass mouth
I like to say it fast
I like to say it quick
I'ma call your ass chimney
'Cause you look like a brick

My name says it all
Ain't no need to try to force it
Look at my body in this brand-new corset
Mens turn around
Pants comin' down
Go home, hoes
Where my Drag Race crown?
I look like Linda
And walk like Naomi
Get messed up like Kate
And you don't even know me
Lookin' like this
Is a goddamn stunt
All you other bitches better lick my...
Foot!

She feelin' some type of way
Oh no she better don't
(Ooh child!)
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
(Uh!)
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
(Oh yes she better do!)
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
Oh no she better don't
(Oh yeah she better Xanadu!)
Oh no she better don't
