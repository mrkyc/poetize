Given all you could to the relationship
Like a full time job, nine to five you gotta work it, work it
But the best of you has yet to arrive
All the love inside is all the love you ever needed, needed

All the dreams you had, all the things you wanted
Don't turn your back, it's not too late
You better love yourself, before you love somebody
Love somebody, love somebody!

Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen? (Uhhh-hmm)
If you can't love yourself
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
A-amen

Say hello-goodbye, maybe another try
After a while you find history repeatin-peatin'
'Til you realize, your love is alive
All the love inside is all the love you ever needed, needed
You might also like
All the dreams you had, all the things you wanted
Don't turn your back, it's not too late
You better love yourself, before you love somebody
Love somebody, love somebody!

Can I get an amen? (Oh-ohh)
Can I get an amen? (Ouh-ohh)
If you can't love yourself
(How in the hell you gonna love) somebody else?
Can I get an amen? (Oh-ohhh)
Can I get an amen? (Oh-uohhh)
If you can't love yourself
(How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?)
A-amen

There's a fork in the road
Which way will you go?
You standing still or will you step into the great unknown?
It's yours to decide
This is your life
This is your life!
Can I get an amen?
(Can I get an amen?)
(If you can't love yourself)
(How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?)
Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
If you can't love yourself
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen? (All the dreams you had)
Can I get an amen? (All the things you wanted)
If you can't love yourself (Don't turn your back)
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else? (It's not too late)
Can I get an amen? (You better love yourself)
Can I get an amen? (Before you love somebody)
If you can't love yourself (Love somebody)
How in the hell you gonna love somebody else? (Love somebody)
