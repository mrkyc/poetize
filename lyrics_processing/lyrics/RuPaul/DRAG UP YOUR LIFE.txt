Drag up, drag up your life!
Drag up, drag up your life!

Beauty and intelligence in one combined
Serving body to the fifth power to the cosine
Maybe I can tutor you, just read my text
You can meet me after class, baby we can solve for X, uh!

Say "yes" to drag, "yes ma'am!" to drag
This lace, it pays
Unleash the diva that lives deep inside your mind
If you want to play

Dra-a-ag up your life
Super duper!
Doesn't matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life
Dra-a-ag up your life
Precisely!
Doesn't matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life

One! Two! Three! Four!

It's a kind of crappy world and it sucks
There's bigotry, the GOP, and misplaced tucks
So smear your lipstick on in the shape of a smile
If you hate it, fake it, make it into something less vile

Oh girl, just add some sparkle
It feels so sexy and free and you'll see, yes you will!
Work the glitz and glamour, be flashy for the camera
So gay gay gay, bitch, if you want to play

Dra-a-ag up your life
Fine
Doesn't matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life
Dra-a-ag up your life
Okay!
Doesn't matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life

Rrrrra-ka-ta-ti-ti-ta-ta
Yeah, I'm pussy, bitch!
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la
C'est bon, c'est bon
Do-go-choco-la-ta-la
You can't take my snatch
Drag it up, wild it up
Give me more, bring it to the ball!
Hahahaha!
Dra-a-ag up your life
Rrrrrah!
Doesn't matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life
Dra-a-ag up your life
C'est la vie!
Doesn't matter if you're black or white
Any color, you can drag up your life

Drag up your life!
