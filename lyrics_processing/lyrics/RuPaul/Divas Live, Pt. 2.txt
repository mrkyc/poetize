Well howdy, Ru!
It takes a lot of money to look that cheap and I should know!
Ha ha ha!
(sung)
Give me one shot, one shot of adrenaline...hoo!
And to the ones I love
Know that you're the reason why
I dare to live my life
Dare to liberate my mind
You're running through my veins
Make me come alive
1-2-3!
Give me one shot, one shot of adrenaline, adrenaline
Give me one shot, one shot of adrenaline, adrenaline
Give me one shot, one shot of adrenaline
Hoo!
(spoken)
Can I get it to-go, Ru?
Ha ha ha ha!
Ladies and gentlemen, Mariah Carey!

(If real is what you feel, feelings aren't real)
Happy new year everybody!
(Put your money down, place your bet and spin the wheel)
You made this song number one
(If real is what you feel, feelings aren't real)
Can I get more of me?
(Put your money down place your bet and spin the wheel)
I guess we're...going over here
(I know what you feel)
I know what I...nope
(What I feel is real)
Someone's getting fired
(What I feel is real)
Let's let the audience sing along
(I know what I feel)
You sound good!
(It's real, it's real)
Cut the track
(It's real, it's real)
Cut the track

Who you waitin' for?
Another savior?
Always lookin' but you never find, never find
Tell me one thing, do you like where ya goin'?
Runnin' all the red lights
I said ooh!
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
I'll tell you the truth now
All born naked and the rest is drag
(spoken)
Spin with me
(sung)
La la la la la
La la la la la la

All born naked and the rest is drag
(spoken)
I'm a little dizzy, Ru
Ladies and gentlemen, Julie Andrews

(spoken)
Hello, Ru! It's Julie Andrews
Whenever there's something I can't face
I sing this simple tune
(rapping)
Guess who's back in the house?
Heels click-clackin' about
Fine, fresh, feminine, style to eleven
I'm divine, so heavenly
Gentlemen sweatin'
It's dimes across the board no doubt
Body like WOW!
Pussy 'bout to end this drought
Titties so plentiful, fish queen Jezebel
Should be criminal
Don't make sense for a bitch to be this endowed
I been that bitch, yes I love that drama
Fishy, feminine up-and-comer
From the Clintons to the Obamas
I keep it tight, now they call me Mother
Shady queen bitch, I love that drama
Fishy, feminine up-and-comer
From the Clintons to the Obamas
I keep it tight, now they call...
Me...
Mother...
(spoken)
Microphone drop! Good day!
Please welcome, Diana Ross
Here we go again
Chapter two
Turn another page
You know the world don't have to end
Long as the DJ records spin
(This is the main event, are you ready?)
Oh oh!
(Just let the music dance into you soul)
Ooh ooh oooohh
(Faster and faster, exhilarating!)
Oh!
(Just let the music make you lose control
This is the main event)
I love you, Ru, I love you!
I mean it, I mean it!
If you need me, text me!
Outro: All (Trixie Mattel as Dolly)
You say that we inspire you (We inspire you)
But when all is said and done (Said and done)
You're the brightest, tallest star of all
