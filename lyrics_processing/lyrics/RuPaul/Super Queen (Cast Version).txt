Hey, hey

She's here to set the bar
To shine her all star
Ain't takin' names 'cause she's a bad bitch, yeah
When they don't know what's up
Prepare to soak it up
It's clear she's here and she's a savage, mhm

She popping, she dipping, she spinning, rockstar
She dropping, she flipping, she winning so hard
You better believe that the power is real

She's a super queen (never miss a beat)
She's a super queen (landing on her feet, hey, hey, hey)
She's a super queen (turning up the heat)
She's a super queen (flawless victory, yeah)

When she walks in, into the club
Hits the stage, grab the mic, work the crowd-pool
She's enticing, mesmerizing
And she got the whole club raging
She's a hot girl, not a thot girl
More than just a one night stand girl
She is classy, never ashy
Only ballers in her VIP
You might also like
She popping, she dipping, she spinning, rockstar
She dropping, she flipping, she winning so hard
You better believe that the power is real

She's a super queen (never miss a beat)
She's a super queen (landing on her feet, hey, hey, hey)
She's a super queen (turning up the heat)
She's a super queen (flawless victory, yeah)

Legs up in the sky, you'll see
Lips pumped like the old Kylie
Not elastic, bitch
But, damn, them thighs, they really do stretch
Pose, serve, now work
Giving body, no curves

She's a super queen (never miss a beat, hey, hey)
She's a super queen (landing on her feet, oh, oh)
She's a super queen (turning up the heat, hey, hey)
She's a super queen (baby, baby, baby, oh)

One, two, three, four
She walks the fashion when it hits the floor
Five, seven, back to six
She's got the talent, don't need the splits
Eight, nine, and she's giving you tens
Let's see the finals scores, bitch, it's Trin for the win
She's got the tucking moves with the looks so lean
You already know her name, she's a super queen
She's a super queen (never miss a beat, hey, hey)
She's a super queen (landing on her feet, oh, oh)
She's a super queen (turning up the heat)
She's a super queen (hey, hey, hey, hey, oh)

She's a super queen
Take it to the top, you know she turning it out
She's a super queen
Making jaws drop, don't stop, that's what it's about
She's a super queen
Pussy gonna pop, this bop, she rockin' the crowd
She's a super queen
