Stroll down the runway
Another payday
Cover of magazines
And when they see me
They wanna be me
I am their fantasy

Cover girl!
Put the bass in your walk
Head to toe, let your whole body talk
(Cover girl, put the bass in your walk)
(Head to toe let your whole body talk)

To Grumman's Chinese, Red Carpet TV
Valet my limousine
Box office sweetie, an Oscar nominee
Now watch me snatch trophies

Cover girl!
Put the bass in your walk
Head to toe let your whole body talk
(Cover girl, put the bass in your walk)
(Head to toe let your whole body talk)

Walk... now walk (uh, uh)... walk... now walk (and what?)
Walk... now walk (uh, uh)...
Uh! Come on BeBe, bring it
For Cameroon, bring it

Face, face, face, I give face
Beauty face, you can't take? It's ok
Watch my body go insane
Everyone keeps looking at me
You know I am Sarah P
If you wanna come for me and you feel the need
Come right now and walk the beat!
