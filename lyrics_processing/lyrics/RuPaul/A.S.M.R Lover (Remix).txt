(Mhi'yeezy)
You make me feel like a dainty lady
High heel boots, straight out of Haiti
So 305, so Dade County
With my stank ass walk, boy, you know I'm crazy
(Mhi'ya, Mhi'ya)
Is the name they're screamin' when they see me flippin'
(Mhi'ya, Mhi'ya)
Is the drag that took her man, bitch

Clearing customs left and right
Geneva Karr has just arrived
La diva mas latina that your eyes will ever see
I mean, just look at me, I'm what? Sickening
If you wanna read, there'll be subtitles down here
So you can keep up, 'cause, baby, I am fierce
Move away or Miss Karr will run you over

You make me feel
Whisper in my ear
That's what you are, lover
A-S-M-R, you for real?
All I wanna hear
Whatever you have to say
As long as you whisper to me
You might also like
Ayy, ayy, ay, ay, ay
A-S-M-R lover
That's what you are to me
Ayy, ayy, ay, ay, ay
A-S-M-R lover
That is what you are

Down on your knees, bitch, pray to me
'Cause Megami is the goddess that you'll pay to see
That's M-E-G-A-M-I, what?
Clear the runway, watch a big girl strut
It's just the beginning, I'll keep your head spinning
And all the boys sinning, I better start winning
Ain't nobody ever eat the runway like I do
Running over bitches, order-up, drive-thru

Gone with the wind, I'm fabulous
These mothertucking hoes can't handle us
Breaking wind, serving fashion
Acting up like Ru said, "Action"
Catch banana fever, I'll make you a believer
Flew from Taiwan just to say, "Hello"
I'm Nymphia and you better vote yellow
You make me feel
Whisper in my ear (Vroom, vroom)
That's what you are, lover
A-S-M-R, you for real?
All I wanna hear (I'm holy)
Whatever you have to say
As long as you whisper to me

Ayy, ayy, ay, ay, ay (Banana)
A-S-M-R lover
That's what you are to me
Ayy, ayy, ay, ay, ay (Ooh-ooh)
A-S-M-R lover
