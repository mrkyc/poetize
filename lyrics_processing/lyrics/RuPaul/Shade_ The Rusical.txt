In the city of drag queens, there's a fine line between being shady and being a lady. This is Penny, which will she choose?

I just got off the bus
I don't drink or eat or cuss

You're new in town it's time to knuckle down
Start swimming to the top before you drown

Who are you?

We are the pageant queens (oh, fancy)
We're elegant machines
In gowns we strut
We don't need corny smut

What?

Let's hold back and see which way she leans
You might also like
Who are you?

We are the comedy queens (oh, cute)
Humor always justifies the means
Gia (Darienne) (GiaCourtneyWhile she's there telling a joke (look!)
I'm right behind you, poke (oh!)
[D
Arianne +eGia (Gia)]
So don't listen to them 'cause they're just full of beans (literally!)

Who's that?

Wait!
She's the shady queen, horrid queen
No one wants to see her

On her own, all alone
No one wants to be her

Listen up pretty pup!
She's on her way to six feet (underground)

Yes, and nothing nice
Nothing good ever goes her way, so -

Miss "Off the Bus"
Stick with us
Even Ru would say so!

Who?

(Gasp)
Rupaul!

Oh!

Turn around!
We are the better queens
The safer queens, the lighter queens
The brighter queens, the wiser queens
Advisor queens, the ones who you should stick with
Penny, you really wanna be a star?

Yeah I do!

No! Don't do it!

She's got testicles! I've seen them!

She's a man with one eye!

There's a hole in your heart
There'a place in your soul
A passion so strong
It makes your blood boil
All your dreams come alive
All your wishes will grow
If you take a swig of this fish oil
Drink for me!

Oh, I'd really like to but I shouldn't I-

Drink for me!

But I do want to be a big, big star!

Drink for me!

Don't do it! Don't do it!

Drink for me!

You'll lose it! You'll lose it!

Well I'm gonna be the greatest star
And nothing and no one's gonna keep me down
And you, and you, and all of you
I'll make you love me!

Don't do it! Don't do it!

Oh I can't get it open -

Here!

Don't do it! Don't do it!

Watch me be your star!

All tea all shade!

Thanks to fish oil, our good little penny became one bad penny. But, she got her fame

Cause I'm the biggest star, and I'm going far!
Just a miracle in front of you
Oh, and if you don't believe
I will show you, I'll teach you, I'll school you, I'll beat you
And punch you, and crunch you
I'll take you and make you thank me
When you love me!
That's how you do it, [back rolls!

Did you see what she said to me!

Back rolls! heard it!

Can you believe, can you believe she even said that!

Yshe really did! Oh yes she really, really went there!

Well I'm not gonna stick around and be a part of her show

But you have to! Girl, the paycheck!

Oh, right! Ugh

No, I'll never love anyone else
Like I love myself
Oh no, no, no, no
I'll never love anyone else!

Ai dios mio! The's going down! too much fish oil!
Now's our chance!

Watch us rise to the top
'Cause we're the fresh fish on the scene
We're the new girls in town
We're stepping right over this queen!
She's been throwing some shade
Nd now we don't give a damn
Take away her fish oil!
And there ain't nothing left there, man!
Woo!
Center stage
Another chapter, time to turn the page
[April, Laganja, Joslyn
And finally I'm the star!
No I',m the star!
No I'm the star!
No girl! (mumb
Ed fighting)

Oh the shade! the shade of it all!
Look at yourself, shady ladies
You should be ashamed of what you've become
Oh, I never thought that you would do this
So let me remind you of just one thing
Take each other's hands and come together cause
We are each other's family
All 2,603,040 sisters!
This is our land and we are the queens

Time to take a stand and come together (we come together)
Cause, we are each other's family (we're all family)
All 2,603,040 sisters (many queens)
This is our land, and we are the queens!

So even if you're a pageant queen!

Or a comedy queen!

Or a fishy queen!

A shady queen!

Or just a big damn girl!

We are a family!
