Queen, queen
London, Paris, New York, disco
Uptown, downtown, Rio, Singapore
Don't you know, bitch, I'm from Chicago
Turn to the left, Miss Kilimanjaro
Queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Ooh, queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)

Body of a Goddess, face of Aphrodite
She's a new bitch, Miss Ass Almighty
Davenport diamonds just can't be stopped
She twerked her way straight to the top
I'm the Diahann Carroll of Ru's Dynasty
You'll get read so please don't try me
Yes, she's strikin' but don't you stare
Say "Hey Miss A'Keria" when you see her

Intergalactic, Earth to Pluto
Superstar boss all through the cosmos
Mashin' you like a Idaho potato
Whippin' you up like a space tornado
You might also like
Queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Ooh, queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Where is the body?
Bitch, she's the body
Ooh, queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Yes, Miss Body
Miss A'Keria is the body

Queen of the north got one thing to say
I never liked double dutch
I didn't come to play
I stomp the runway, hit the pose
Double ones across the floor
Let these other hoes know
That I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Bitch, I'm on point literally
Queens everywhere, jump to it pronto
House of Hytes, that's how you do it in Toronto
Intergalactic, Earth to Pluto
Superstar boss all through the cosmos
Mashin' you like a Idaho potato
Whippin' you up like a space tornado

Queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Ooh, queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
No doubt about it, the queen of the north is here
Queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Blame Canada bitches, eh?
Ooh, queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Do you validate parking?

I'm big Silk and I came to rock
My personality can not be topped
Ooh, this mug is on lock
Twirl, whip, drop it like it's hot
All the big queens that's doin' the do
Remember this track was made for you
Keep your head up and never snooze
You'll turn out like me and Ru
Miss Vanjie, Vanjie, Vanjie, bitch
Drop down low to the floor and spin
Fish Latina, really nice to meet 'ya
'Cause I save the room, they give me 10s to see her
I whip my hair side to side
Category closed, bitch, I'm fly
Slip and slide, thigh highs
Gagagagagagaga, bye-bye

London, Paris, New York, disco
Uptown, downtown, Rio, Singapore
Don't you know, bitch, I'm from Chicago
Turn to the left, Miss Kilimanjaro

Queens, they're everywhere

Ooh, queens, they're everywhere

I'm Yvie Oddly and oddly enough
My edges stay shredded but these tits are tough
When other girls fake, I just call out their bluff
So glue on those shoes and tighten them tucks
And I know I play rough but that's how I tumble
I bend over backwards whenever I fumble
I'm giving my all to shine like RuPaul
So pardon me bitches if I don't seem humble
Odd Bless
Howdy-ooh!

All right big girls, that do include you
Show us what you got baby
You ain't tired yet
Now twirl, twirl, twirl, twirl
Queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
Mama, you want me to twirl?
Drag queens run the world
Ooh, queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)

Queens, they're everywhere
(Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere)
All these quee- ooh, child, look who just walked through the do'
Ooh, queens (They're everywhere)
Well, you just never know
