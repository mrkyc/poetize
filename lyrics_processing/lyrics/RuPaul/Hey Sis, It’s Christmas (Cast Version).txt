Hey sis, it's Christmas
You can cross me off of your wish list
Call Santa Claus and the Missus
We gon' have the best Christmas that ever existed
Hey sis, it's Christmas
Come on over, sis, you can't miss this
Don't need gifts, now can I get a witness
We gon' have the best Christmas that ever existed

Dingaling, dong
Come jingle my bells
Pat-pat my padded ass, promise I won't tell
Aha, I'm on the naughty list
But I'm a top three queen, if you catch my drift
Hey, we're under mistletoe
Came to prove myself to you ho-ho-hoes
Come on and jump on my sleigh
Have hell of a Christmas with Ella Vaday

Gettin' fired up, I'm ready for the healing
Sugarplum fairy dancing on the ceiling
Hearing them angels singing I'm feeling high
You might also like

Pull my cracker, it's your favourite Kitty
Scott-Claus is the name, always blonde, what a fittie
A thousand voices in this busty queen
Cilla, Gemma, and even Nadine
Made my way to a spot in top three
Old Saint Nick, I'm gonna climb you like a tree
Don't need no gifts, I'm here to win the crown
Santa, baby, come on pull my knickers down

Gettin' fired up, I'm ready for the healing
Sugarplum fairy dancing on the ceiling
Hearing them angels singing I'm feeling high

Get Krystalized at Christmas time
All these other girls better get in line
It's Krystal with a "K," get straight to the "V"
It's time to party with Miss Versace
Santa, babe, I really want my crown
The time has come for these girls to bow down
I'm so delish, come and taste this dish
Shhhh, you wish

Gettin' fired up, I'm ready for the healing
Sugarplum fairy dancing on the ceiling
Hearing them angels singing I'm feeling high
