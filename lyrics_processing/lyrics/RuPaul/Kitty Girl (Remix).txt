In the dis-
In the dis-
In the dis-
In the disco heat
Hey hey hey hey

Know you're sexy and keep slaying the game
Make the world remember your name
Feel your puss down deep in your soul (hey, hey)
Let your body lose control

Hey kitty girl
It's your world
When you walk the street
Steppin' to the beat
Hey kitty girl
Get your twirl
In the disco heat
You're the boogie-body-rockin' queen

Step aside, I'm back again
So hype, so lit, adrenaline
I'm Shangela, say what?!
Started as a baby, now I'm all grown up
Gonna take this verse just to let you know (uh-huh)
Never listen to the haters, be a pro
'Cause I worked my way, paid my dues
Now I got the whole world screaming halleloo!

Hey kitty girl
It's your world
When you walk the street
Steppin' to the beat
Hey kitty girl
Get your twirl
In the disco heat
You're the boogie-body-rockin' queen

Mirror, mirror on the wall
I'm the fiercest of them all
Face, face, face, body and all
Another day, another slay
Meow meow, savage beauty
Stepping out on a mission
Get fierce, stay ready
The OG's back for another crown

Hey kitty girl
It's your world
When you walk the street
Steppin' to the beat
Hey kitty girl
Get your twirl
In the disco heat
You're the boogie-body-rockin' queen
Steppin' to the plate, I'm Trixie Mattel
Got my name in the game, better learn it well
'Cause I'm the MVP heading up to bat
And I'll go to third base, but I'd never tell that
I got bleach in the blonde like Pamela
And I'm steppin' out the box like Shangela
I got long thick legs, a tarantula
And if you call me kitty girl, I can handle ya
Uh!

Hey kitty girl
It's your world
When you walk the street
Steppin' to the beat
Hey kitty girl
Get your twirl
In the disco heat
You're the boogie-body-rockin' queen

Boogie-body-rockin' queen
B-boogie-body-rockin' queen
Boogie-body-rockin' queen
B-b-boogie-body-rockin' queen
Boog-boog- boogie-body-rockin' queen
Boogie-body-rockin' queen
Boog-boog- boogie-body-rockin' queen

Woah oh oh

All you have to do is believe in you
In a high heeled shoe
When you walk, come through
Keep on dreaming because dreams come true
No matter what you do keep your head up, Ru
