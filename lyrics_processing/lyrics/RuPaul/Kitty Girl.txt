Hey hey hey hey

Hey kitty girl
It's your world
When you walk the street
Steppin' to the beat
Hey kitty girl
Get your twirl
In the disco heat
You're the boogie-body-rockin' queen

Gone tomorrow
But you're here for today
Catwalk it
Like the world is your run-run-runway
People say that when the dog is away
Kitty cats are gonna come out and play

No time for pussy-footin' around-round-round
Bad kitty, good pussy, meow
Tell papa "hey yo' cat has been found"
