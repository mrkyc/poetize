I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

Now, shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She's feeding fools fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country; think she like me cause I'm from New York?
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch: hit the track, catch a date, and come pay the kid
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see?
You fuckin' with me - you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a blunt up outta me

Yeah, bitch, I got my Now and Later gators on

You're dead wrong if you think that pimpin' gonna die

I'm down with that nigga, 50, like I'm down with blue
'Fuck cuzz', nah, nigga, motherfuck you
G-U-N-I-Tizzy, fuckin' with me and the D-P-Gizzy
Niggas in New York know how Doggy get down
I got my niggas in Queens, I got my bitches Uptown
I got my bu'ness in Manhattan, I ain't fuckin' around
I got some butter pecan Puerto Ricans from the Boogie Down (Down)
That's waiting on me to return
So they can snatch these braids out and put my shit in a perm, word (Word)
They love it when I get to crippin'
And spittin' this maga-agnficent pimpin'

You need to switch over and ride with a star
It'll get you far
I'm a P-I-M-P G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R
Yeah, I'm young, but I ain't dumb
Got some tricks, but I ain't one
I'm a guerrilla for scrilla, I trip you, you try to run
I let 'em do as they please, as long as they get my cheese
Even if they gotta freeze, or if it's a hundred degrees
I keep 'em on they knees, take a look under my sleeve
I ain't gotta give 'em much, they're happy with Mickey D's, pimp

We keep it pimpin' in the South, you know how it go (Dirty, dirty!)
We drive old-school, white walls with mink floors
I spin the G-Unit piece, and get 'em dizzy
Handcuff her if you love her or your girl coming with me
When your neck and wrist glow, she already should know
That money make the world go round, so lets get mo'
It's time to show these playas how it should be done
You got pimp potential, you might/could be one, G-U-nit!

I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah!)
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me (Woo!)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see (Uh-huh)
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me (Uh-huh)
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me (Yeah!)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Yeah)

In Hollywood they say: "there's no bu'ness, like show bu'ness"
In the hood they say: "there's no bu'ness, like hoe bu'ness", you know
They say I talk a li'l fast, but if you listen a li'l faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch!
Ha-ha, ha
