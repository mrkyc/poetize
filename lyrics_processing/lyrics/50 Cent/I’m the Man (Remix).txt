I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We tryna make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'ma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'til I'm pullin' off a lot (Sonny Digital)
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop

I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

Ayy, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money, shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch a come up, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into thirty-six oz
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shawty wanna fuck with me (Oh, baby)
Strippin', yeah, the jiggy, nigga
Later, she gon' hit my line
We ain't gon' waste no time
She suckin' and we fuckin' like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy
All the light in the room from the T.V.
We gettin' it on, then I'm gone
That's the type of shit that a nigga be on
