Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
A home, A home
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the sky is not clouded all day
Oh give me a land where the where the bright diamond sand
Throws it's light from the glittering streams
Where I am alone with the graceful white swan
Like the fate in her heavenly dreams
A home, A home
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the sky is not clouded all day
Oh! give me a gale of the Solomon vale
Where the life streams with buoyancy flow
On the banks of the Beaver, where seldom if ever
Any poisonous herbage doth grow
A home, A home
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the sky is not clouded all day
You might also likeHow often at night, when the heavens were bright
With the light of the twinkling stars
Have I stood here amazed, and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceed that of ours
A home, A home
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the sky is not clouded all day
I love the wild flowers in this bright land of ours
I love the wild curlew's shrill scream
The bluffs and white rocks, and antelope flocks
That graze on the mountains so green
A home, A home
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the sky is not clouded all day
The air is so pure and the breezes so fine
The zephyrs so balmy and light
That I would not exchange my home here to range
Forever in azures so bright
A home, A home
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the sky is not clouded all day
