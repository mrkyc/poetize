Didn't think about what car to ride
Is it Phana or the, the Lamgocha?
I got got stuff for you haters, I make my paper you haters
When I see you in the street, I don't speak to you haters
So you never thought you'd see a young fly nigga ball
You see me on top, see me rolling, see me fall
It's like a jungle sometimes, it make me wonder
How I keep from going under when I rock with ten summers
And I still get my numbers and I still stay humble (Yes)
