It's me, snitches
Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on
It's showtime
Uh huh, yes yes yes

Chillin' in my Beemer, listenin' to Ether
Bumping through your speakers, know I got the heaters
Rock and don't stop, I get the rocking, don't stop (Stop)
I'm bangin' 'em beats you know I like the head bops, stop

Freeze!
You know who it is!
It's me, snitches!

Smoke good, eat good, drink good, f**k good
Comin' to the club, stuntin' li-ike you should
My s**t on fire, I don't need no gasolina
I'm comin' through your block with the new two seater
Ring the alarm, man, call me the sandman
When I drop beats, I'm the one man band man
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the money, dollar dollar bills, y'all

Vida loco, flying through popo
See me in that four door, that Bentley esporta
Benz all lethal, my rims all lethal
You front, I'ma Imma shoot that ass like a free throw
Sniffin' that {yayo}, trying to be Sosa
Trying to be tough when that's some black {chocha}
I ain't gotta shoot ya, I can just choke ya
You're trying to make paper, I could just show ya

Freeze!
You know who it is!
It's me, snitches!
