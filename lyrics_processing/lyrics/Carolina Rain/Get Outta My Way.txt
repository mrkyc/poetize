But let me pretend I'm talkin' to you
(Talkin' to you.)
'Cause I'm lookin' at her, an' I like what I see
No, don't turn around, she's lookin' at me
(Lookin' at me.)
Yeah, she knows I know
Well, you know:
I gotta go before she runs like a fast little filly
She's a five alarm fire, a hot bowl of chilli
An' she's burnin' a hole in this hillbilly
An' I can't let her get away
I gotta say somethin' kinda funny, just a little bit crazy
That'll make her want to think about bein' my baby
'Cause I know what I want and I ain't waitin' all day
So hey, get outta my way
(Na, na na na, na na na na, na na na na.)
I know I drove you here, but, well could you find a ride home?
'Cause I'm a man on a mission, gotta go it alone
(Go it alone.)
Here's a ten for a cab, an' you can finish my beer
'Cause she's into me; I'm into her an' we're outta here
(We're outta here.)
Yeah, she knows I know
Well, c'mon, you know:

Wait a minute, what's she doin' now?
She's puttin' her coat on
Wavin' her keys, lookin' at me:
All right, goodnight, gotta go be...

She's a five alarm fire, a hot bowl of chilli
