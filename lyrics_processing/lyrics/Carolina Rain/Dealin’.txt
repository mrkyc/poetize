'Cause my ex-wife won't take my calls
They changed my shift at work
It's getting cold and my shoulder hurts
But here I am, copin' with it all
Dealin' with the traffic, reelin' from the fumes
Dealin with the everywhere I look bad news
And wonderin' how on earth I should be feelin'
I'm dealin' with my taxes and my 401k
Dealin' with losin' more ground every day
And reachin' for a dream I still believe in
So I keep on dealin'
My best friend Joe just lost his mama
And someone stole my sister's car
Oh but, they'll get by as long as there's
A thread of hope and a chain of prayer
I know it's not been easy but so far
They're dealin' with the doctors, reelin' from the pain
Dealin' with the clouds and cursin' at the rain
And wonderin' how on earth they should be feelin
Dealin' with the cost just to get from A to B
Dealin' with the crazies and the crime in the streets
And reachin' for a dream they still believe in
So they keep on dealin'

The sun comes up and the sun goes down
But it sure helps knowin' that you're not alone
Cause everyone is
Dealin' witht the traffic, reelin' from the fumes
Dealin with the everywhere we look bad news
And wonderin' how on earth we should be feelin'
Yeah, I'm still dealin' with the creditors that I can't pay
Livin' on a vision of a brighter day
And reachin' for a dream I still believe in
So I keep on dealin'
Oooooooh, well I'm gonna keep on dealin'
Oooooooh, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm gonna keep on dealin
Yeah, I'm dealin', I'm just dealin', ooooooooh
I'm just dealin'
And I'm gonna keep on dealin'
