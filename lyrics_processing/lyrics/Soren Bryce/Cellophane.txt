Bittersweet kid, I'm not listening
Can we work this out in the morning?
When you're like this, I can't stomach it
Could you put down what you're holding?

Do I need to spell it out, spell it out?
I can't form words with my mouth
Do I need to spell it out, spell it out?
You've got me alone now

Don't get too close to me
You'll be loving me, loving me forever, better
And I choke on cellophane
Inhaling all the things that make you better, better
Don't get too close to me
You'll be loving me, loving me forever, better
And I choke on cellophane
Inhaling all the things that make you better, better

My insides like a sink
I'll clean them out in the morning
When you're like this, we don't speak
Bleach these please

Do I need to spell it out, spell it out?
I can't form words with my mouth

Don't get too close to me
You'll be loving me, loving me forever, better
And I choke on cellophane
Inhaling all the things that make you better, better
Don't get too close to me
You'll be loving me, loving me forever, better
And I choke on cellophane
Inhaling all the things that make you better, better

Don't get too, don't get too
Better better, better better
Don't get too, don't get too
Better better, better better
Don't get too, don't get too
Better better, better better
Don't get too, don't get too
Better better, better better

Don't get too close to me
You'll be loving me, loving me forever, better
And I choke on cellophane
Inhaling all the things that make you better, better
Don't get too close to me
You'll be loving me, loving me forever, better
And I choke on cellophane
