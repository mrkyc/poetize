Green, yellow, red, all wrapped in gelatin
Lift it up, find your mouth, then swallow it
Love isn't love till your tolerance means breaking it
You breathe it in, you breathe it in

I know how your hands shake
As you hide a pretty bottle in your suitcase
I know what your friends say
When you tell them to go out and get shit-faced

I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna see a cold-hearted killer
In the middle of the night, oh
I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna be a left-handed lover
When you choose to love another, oh

Left-handed lover
When you choose to love another, oh

Prince of the night, your effects come crashing in
See the sky, reach for life, and follow it
As the world swirls and cracks like porcelain
You breathe it in, you breathe it in
You might also like
I know how your words shake
When you're screaming you 'want it to all go away'
I know what you could say
If you weren't fucked up enough to even see straight

I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna see a cold-hearted killer
In the middle of the night, oh
I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna be a left-hand lover
When you choose to love another, oh

I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna

I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna see a cold-hearted killer
In the middle of the night, oh
I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna be your left-handed lover
When you choose to love another, oh
I don't wanna be a-
No, I don't wanna see a-
I don't want it in the middle of the night, oh
I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna be your left-over lover
When you choose to love another, oh
Left-over lover
