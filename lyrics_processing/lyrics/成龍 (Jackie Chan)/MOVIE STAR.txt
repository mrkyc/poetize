Action!
Camera!
ER! ER! ER!
All right!
Get up myself and make a deal
Don't play that song (don't play that song)
I wanna travel on (just travel on)
Don't make me sad (don't make me sad)
I wanna be your man
Remember me (remember me)
When we were young and free (young and free)
I'd like to be (I'd like to be)
A movie star
Don't sing for me
I wanna be your man
I'm looking for
Love every night and day
Give me your word
That you will never see
That's all again
Or you would treat me wrong
Get up myself and make a deal
Don't play that song (don't play that song)
I wanna travel on (just travel on)
Don't make me sad (don't make me sad)
I wanna be your man
Remember me (remember me)
When we were young and free (young and free)
I'd like to be (I'd like to be)
A movie star
You might also likeI wanna see
I wanna be your man
Just miss your love
Love every night and day
I give my word
That I will never love
Anyone else
So I won't treat you wrong
Cut!

Ouch! All right!
Get up myself and make a deal

Don't make me sad (don't make me sad)
I wanna be your man
Remember me (remember me)
When we were young and free (young and free)
I'd like to be (I'd like to be)
