This time (this time)
I am gonna give you
All the loving you need
(This time) This time
Set your heart free
Set your love free (this time)

How can I be at ease when I know soon
I'll lay my eyes on you?
I close my eyes imagining the moment
That my dreams are gonna come true
The way you wear your hair
The shyness underneath your smile
The warmth of your embrace
Is gonna thrill me in just a little while
I rushed right in before but right now
I'm gonna take my time
Every moment we share
I'm gonna savor like a vintage wine
And when you kiss me
(I'm gonna taste my lips) I won't let go
And when you hold my hand, baby
I won't say no cause
You might also like
Ooh, baby, I want you
I can't live without you, no way
I ain't never gonna love this way again
No time to pretend, no, no, this time
I'm so glad I've got another chance
Mmm, to love you again, oh, this time

I can feel you closer to me
Closer as the moment comes
I thank God for another chance
To love that very special one (Thank you)
Will he return my love?
I've held on for so many years
I close my eyes to cry
Then I heard you whisper in my ear

Ooh, baby, I want you (Oh, I want you)
I can't live without you, no way (no way)
I ain't never gonna love this way again (no, no)
No time to pretend, no, no, this time (this time)
I'm so glad I've got another chance
Mmm, to love you again
And again and again and again
Oh, this time, I'm gonna give you
All the love you need
Set your heart free, ooh
This time it's gonna be forever (forever)
This time I'm gonna give you
All the love you need
(All the love you need)
Set your love free
(Set your love free, set your heart free)
Ooh, this time it's gonna be forever
Happiness, I can't explain
Inside I have you just for mine
I'm kissing your lips, you're loving me
This phrase keeps running through my mind
Ooh, baby, I want you (Oh, baby I want you)
I can't live without you, no way (no way)
I ain't never gonna love this way again
(Never gonna love this way again)
No time to pretend, no, no, this time (this time)
I'm so glad I've got another chance
(Got another chance)
Mmm, to love you again
And again and again and again
Ooh, this time I'm gonna give you
All the love I me (all the love in me)
Set your heart free, baby
(Set your heart free, set your love free)
Oooh, this time, this time, this time
I'm gonna give you all the love you need
(All the love you need)
Set your love free
(Set your love free set your heart free)
This time, oh, this time
Oh, this time it's gonna be forever
Ooh, baby, I want you
I can't live without you no way
I ain't never gonna love this way again
No time to pretend, no, no, this time
I'm so glad I've got another chance
Mmm, to love you again
