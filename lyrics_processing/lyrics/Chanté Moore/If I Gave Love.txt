Uh, I like that
I'ma make you dance a little
Darkchild will make you dance a little
Chante will make you dance a little
We gon' make you dance a little, c'mon

If I gave you love, then where would that lead me?
If I gave my trust, would you use it against me?
And if love starts again, would the ending be the same?
Or will you prove to be the only one for me?
If I gave love

If I could look into your eyes and see the truth
Then I would know if I should try to put all of my trust in you
Not havin' to worry about if things would change
Once I gave myself to you
I hoped that you would stay the same

'Cause I put all my trust in the wrong hands (Oh, oh)
And I don't ever want to feel pain again (No-no no-no, no no-ooh)
So, how do I know that you're the right man? (How could I know it?)
But I pray that you are, so our love could begin

If I gave love

I'm takin' a chance on you and me, boy
You've given me a reason to let you inside my life
I've been in love before, I know this feeling
I gotta know this time this love is right
I gotta know that love is right, oh

Not enough just to say the words "I love you"
(Can't say it, baby baby)
Gotta make sure that you're doin' everything you say
('Cause I'm not impressed by lines I've already heard before, baby, anymore)
I'm not impressed by lines I've heard before
(No-no, no-no, no-no)
When it's said and done, those lines will fade away

And if love starts again, would the ending be the same?
(No, there would rather be this ending)
Or will you prove to be the only one for me?
(Oh, no no, no no no no)
Not much to ask of you
I ask that you be true
Don't take my love for granted
See, I won't be played so easily
Been there, done that before
I can't go there no more
Please, oh, please, don't get me wrong
I just want a love I can count on

If I gave you love, then where would that lead me?
(Where would that lead me?)
If I gave my trust, would you use it against me?
(Don't abuse my trust)
And if love starts again, would the ending be the same? (Oh)
