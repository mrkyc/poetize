Don't look back
There's only things you can not change the past
You're wasting time asking what if you linger on too long
Pick the roses from the thorns
Wash with waters of the storms
See the sun in your bad day
Smell the flowers in the valley

This moment is mine
I'm living inside
I grow with each breath that I take
I cherish my freedom
I'm sharing the joy
I'm glowing like sunshine
I'm spreading my wings, and I fly
I'm still as the night
This moment is mine
This moment is mine

Possibilities travel endless through infinity
Our finite minds can not see the unknown to be
In your worry what can change
Not a thing
In the spirit of your mind
Be renewed
It's not to late
Redeem the time, and seize the day

This moment is mine (This moment is mine)
I'm living inside (I'm living inside)
I grow with each breath that I take
I cherish my freedom
I'm sharing the joy (I'm sharing the joy)
I'm glowing like sunshine
I'm spreading my wings, and I fly
I'm still as the night
(This moment is...)
This moment is mine
This moment is ...
This moment is mine

Sweetest moments passing you by
Live in the now, and let's go
I can't tell you how good it feels
(It's so good to find)
This moment is mine
So I'm taking my time

This moment is mine
I'm walking in love
I grow with each step that I take
I'm lovin' my freedom
I'm rollin' like thunder (I'm rollin' like thunder)
I'm feelin' my power (I'm feelin' my power)
I'm spreading my wings, and I fly
I light up the sky (I light up the sky)
(This moment is...)
This moment is mine
