Naw, it never rains in Southern Californ-i-a
And it probably never ever has a snow-day
But that doesn't mean that we don't know how to celebrate
Say "Who cares about Frosty the Snowman?
We'll plant that Christmas tree in the Santa World"

Palm trees around (we got)
Drop downtown (ghost ride)
83 degrees (so hot)
Water on a fee (real nice)
Keeps on giving gifts on December 25th
This is L.A., baby, holidays and heat waves

Christmas time in L.A
What a beautiful sight, Christmas in the sunshine
Christmas time in L.A
Feels like summer, but it's Christmas in the sunshine

We don't discriminate, no, we show love
Celebrate Christmas, Kwanzaa, even Hanuka
We got a Winter Wonderland up in the sun
In my bikini, sleight bells ringing
Waiting on St. Nick to come

Christmas time in L.A
What a beautiful sight, Christmas in the sunshine
Christmas time in L.A
Feels like summer, but it's Christmas in the sunshine

We got Christmas in the sand
We got Christmas in the sand
We got Christmas in the la-la
In the La-la-la Land
We got Christmas in the sand
We can build a sandman
We got Christmas in the la-la
In the La-la-la Land

Christmas time in L.A
What a beautiful sight, Christmas in the sunshine

Feels like summer, but it's Christmas in the sunshine
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la L.A
What a beautiful sight, Christmas in the sunshine
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la L.A
Feels like summer, but it's Christmas in the sunshine
