It's alright, yeah

Hello, my love
Before the sun rises, after it goes down
I love you, I love you
I say it over and over again
I love you, hey, hey, hey
Relax your mind, we can be free together
Take our time, even through the tears
(Even through the tears)
I'm staying right here, I'm waiting right here
Ooh, we're going through some hard times
But it will be alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now
Everything's alright (baby, it will be)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now
Everything's alright

When teardrops fall
Falling down, running down my face
I need you, please, hear me
Baby, I need you here beside me
Everyday I need to know
That you will not leave me
Promise me, tell me we can work it out
(Tell me we can work it out)
Ooh, baby, without a doubt
(Ooh, baby, without a doubt)
It will be, it will be alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now
It's gonna be alright
Ooh, tell me it will
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now
It's gonna be alright
Baby, come show me (It's alright, it's alright)
I need you to hold me (It's alright, it's alright now)
Tell me it's gonna be alright
And I'll believe you (It's alright, it's alright)
If you tell me (It's alright, it's alright)
Everything is alright (everything is alright)

When the grass looks greener
And I think about leaving
I never go too far
No one else can satisfy me
Because I know how good you are
Baby, hey, you make it alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now
Everything's alright
Tell me it will be alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright now
Everything's alright (everything's alright)
Baby, take my hand (It's alright, it's alright)
And make me understand (It's alright, it's alright)
That everything's gonna be alright
Now, with all that we've been through
(It's alright, it's alright)
Ah, baby (it's alright, it's alright now)
I'll do anything to make it alright (everything's alright)
Ooh, baby (it's alright, it's alright)
Tell me, tell me, tell me (It's alright, it's alright)
Show me it's gonna be, it's gonna be alright
Hey, baby (It's alright, it's alright)
Ooh (It's alright, it's alright now)
It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright (Everything's alright)
We're going through some hard times
But everything will be fine
I know it will be alright
Baby, I know it (It's alright, it's alright)
Oh, baby, I know it (It's alright, it's alright)
I've got the feeling everything's alright
