The smile on my face
It shows everyday
So no one evers knows
How I really feel
Am I really happy?
There's things on my mind
I can't talk about it sometimes
Who can I tell what I really feel When I'm feeling sorry

I cry to myself
(I cry to myself)
When no one else is listening
(No one else is listening I)
I cry to myself
( I cry to myself)
Cause no one else is crying for me

I'll tell you I'm fine
But deep inside I'm dying
When I am all alone
No one sees when lights go down I-I
I cry everynight suffer inside out
No I can't deny this pain is real
But I keep trying I
You might also like
I cry to myself
(I cry to myself)
When no one else is listening
(I cry nobody can hear me crying)
I cry to myself
(I cry)
Uh I-I
Cause nobody else is crying for me

Does anybody care how I feel oh
Everyday I'm trying to hide what is real (what's real)
This pain that I have inside of me is tearing my whole life apart

I cry to myself
(I cry to myself)
When no one else is listening
(Nobody hears me)
I cry to myself
(I cry)
'Cause nobody else is crying for...
Nobody else is crying for me
I'm crying
When no one else is listening
(Nobody hears me, but I, I, I, I...)
I cry to myself
(I cry)
'Cause nobody else is crying  me
I cry to myself
(I cry to myself)
'Cause no one else is listening
I cry to myself
'Cause nobody else is crying for me

I cry to myself
(Nobody knows but me)
'Cause no one else is listening
(No one hears me cry)
I cry to myself, I cry
'Cause nobody else is crying for me
Nobody crying for me
