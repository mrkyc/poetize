My special perfect one
My special perfect one

His hands, his face, his ways, his body over there
The way he talks to me, those eyes, his tenderness and his power
His strength, and add the passion between you and me
This would be my perfect man
I mean, purposed and catered to me and my body

Will I find you all wrapped in one?
My search has begun but will you come?
(My special perfect one)
I see pieces of my burried treasure here and there
I'm looking everywhere (my special perfect one)
It gets so hard sometimes, but I'm not givin' up until I find
(My special perfect one)
My special one (my special perfect one)
My special perfect one (my special perfect one)

Is it all in my mind?
Is there no such thing, "one man havin' everthing"?
I refuse to believe he's fantasy
'Cause he's everywhere, he's all I see
You might also like
His hands, his face, his ways, his body over there

How sweet it will be, for you and me
Once the moment comes, and we finally meet?
I'm savin' all of my love for you
I know you're savin' all yours for me, too
'Cause you're my (my special perfect one)
My special one (my special perfect one)
Twist of fate, my prayers, I'll just wait for my soulmate
