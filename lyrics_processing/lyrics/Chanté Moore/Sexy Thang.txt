How can I tell you how you've touched my life?
I have no words to describe you
Do you remember when you wrote "I love you" in my hand ?
I thought to myself "This is the man"
There's something about you

(You've got that)
You've got that sexy thang goin' on (goin' on)
(You've got that)
You've got that sexy thang goin' on (goin' on)
(You've got that) you've got that sexy thang

Don't you know exactly what drew me to you
Was it your sexy eyes that see right through me
Or was it your caress that provides without words or contest
That you know and I know you're the best
There's something about you

(You've got that)
You've got that sexy thang goin' on (goin' on)
(You've got that)
You've got that sexy thang goin' on (goin' on)
(You've got that) you've got that sexy thang
