It's still early but I think I'm catching feelings
Feeling stronger than I thought I would (I would, I would)
I can't trust myself around you, your lips tempt me
I don't need more stress, don't know if I should

You give me that brand new thing, babe
Got me contemplating if I should
Give all my love to you
Even though it's still young

Baby, I don't know where we're going
But I'm going there with you
Even though our love's still young
My heart got me feeling like I be knowing you

Although our love is young
I believe in us
I know this love is young
Fresh love between us

I get so excited when you text me
And I want it, want it bad
Yeah, I try to hide it
'Cause I didn't wanna love you too much
Did so and you know I like it
You might also like
You give me that brand new thing, babe
Got me contemplating if I should
Give all my love to you
Even though it's still young

Baby, I don't know where we're going
But I'm going there with you
Even though our love's still young
My heart got me feeling like I be knowing you

Although our love is young
I believe in us
I know this love is young
Fresh love between us

No, didn't see this taking over me so soon
Got me feeling so highlight, I 
I should ask if it's the same for you
This happened outta nowhere
No, I told you

Baby, I don't know where we're going
But I'm going there with you
Even though our love's still young
My heart got me feeling like I be knowing you
Baby, I don't know where we're going
But I'm going there with you
Even though our love's still young
My heart got me feeling like I be knowing you
Although our love is young
I believe in us
I know this love is young
