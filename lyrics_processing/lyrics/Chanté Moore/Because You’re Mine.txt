It wasn't long ago I saw and heard somebody say
I give him thanks for all the good things he has sent my way
It's then when I wondered if you didn't do the things you do
If they would still give all the adoration due to you
I only know

It's not because you're good
That I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
But it's because you're mine that is my reason

The more that time goes by the better it becomes to me
It's so much sweeter than I ever dreamed it could be
Don't get me wrong I do enjoy the finer things in life
But life without you I found nothing word that sacrifice
I only know...

It's not because you're good
That I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
But it's because you're mine, that is my reason
It's not because you're good that I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
But it's because you're mine that is my reason
You might also like
You've been so good, and you're oh so kind
I've never found a greater love

It's not because you're good that I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
But it's because you're mine that is my reason
It's not because you're good that I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
But it's because you're mine that is my reason
It's not because you're good that I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
But it's because you're mine that is my reason
It's not because you're good that I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
But it's because you're mine that is my reason
It's not because you're good that I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
But it's because you're mine that is my reason
It's not because you're good that I feel the way I do
It's not because you're kind
That makes life for me brand new
Could be because your love?
It's the only love so true
