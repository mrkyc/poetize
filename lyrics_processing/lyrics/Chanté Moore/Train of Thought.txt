It's been a long day
Too many people, people are stressing me
Where do I begin?
Don't think about, think about what happened
Coming home to you
Boy, that's the only thing that gets me through
'Cause I'm anticipating everything you do
It's the way you touch
Some of the things you say that make it okay

I've completely lost my train of thought
Just what was I saying?
I'm caught up and it's all by your loving
With the things you do
Boy, you make me feel so good
I've completely lost my train of thought
Just what was I saying?
I'm caught up and it's all by your loving
With the things you do
Boy, you make me feel so good

What was I about to say?
Oh, yeah, something, something 'bout my day
Why you lookin' at me that way?
You wanna what?
Wanna do what? Ooh!
Bubble bath, after that
When you do, take your time
Need you to help me, help me unwind

I've completely lost my train of thought
Just what was I saying?
I'm caught up and it's all by your loving
With the things you do
Boy, you make me feel so good
I've completely lost my train of thought
Just what was I saying?
I'm caught up and it's all by your loving
With the things you do
Boy, you make me feel so good

That's why I love you, babe
Do it all day, baby
That's what I wanna do
'Cause I belong to you
I just wanna thank you
For the way you took me into you arms
And held me, oh

I've completely lost my train of thought
Just what was I saying?
I'm caught up and it's all by your loving
With the things you do
Boy, you make me feel so good
I've completely lost my train of thought
Just what was I saying?
I'm caught up and it's all by your loving
With the things you do
