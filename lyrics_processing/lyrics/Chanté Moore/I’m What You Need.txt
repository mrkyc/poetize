I knew from the very first time
I laid eyes on you, baby
That you would be right for me
I knew your heart had been broken
Many times before, sweet baby
And I had to make my move
Before love closed the door
Boy, I know you've been hurt
So many times before, yeah
And it's so hard to trust again
Since you've been let down
Give me the chance, baby
I've got what you need, hey
I'm what you're looking for, I'm what you need

Ooh, I'm what you need (I'm what you need)
And I've got what you want
(I've got what you want)
Put your trust in me (put your trust in me)
I won't let you down (I won't let you down)
Give me a chance (give me a chance)
Let me prove my love for you, babe
(Open your heart) I'm what you need
You might also like
Boy, I know you've cried so many tears
That's too many tears for one heart
You spend so much time all alone by yourself
I'm what you need, I'm what you're looking for
You thought you found true love
But you were deceived
And when you needed real love
They turned you away
You gave your all but your all wasn't good enough
I'm what you want, baby, I'm what you need

Ooh, I'm what you need (I'm what you need)
And I've got what you want
(I've got what you want)
Put your trust in me (put your trust in me)
I won't let you down (I won't let you down)
Give me a chance (give me a chance)
Let me prove my love for you, babe
(Open your heart) I'm what you need

Come on, baby, give love a try
You've got to learn to trust again
And if you let me, I'll wipe the tears from your eyes
Come on, baby, and give love a try
I'm what you need and I've got what you want
Put your trust in me (ooh, yeah, yeah)
I won't let you down (I won't let you down)
Give me a chance (give me a chance)
Let me prove my love for you, babe (ooh)
I'm what you need (I'm what you need, baby)
Give me the chance to prove my love (prove my love)
Boy, I'll never let you down (let you down)
I know that you've been hurt before(hurt before)
I'll wipe the tears, baby, from your eyes (from your eyes)
You've got to learn to trust again (trust again)
Give me your loving, baby, please give in (ooh)
