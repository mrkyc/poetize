Ah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah-oh, ooh, oh
I'm missing you

I remember when the nights were long
And we layed so close, warm in each other's arms
Warm in each others hearts
Now it's a memory, lost inside a dream
We just couldn't reach
I don't understand why we're apart
Life has no beginning 'til I start

Finding my way back to you
(Finding my way back)
Baby, my heart leads me to you
(I'll be finding my way back)
Finding my way back to you
And what I always knew
Loving you could never be wrong

You're always sayin'
You have a life that you (That you)
Must give up just to (Just to)
Just to make it work, making it work for us
Baby, if we hold on, there is no storm (No storm)
We can't overcome
All I'm holding now is emptiness
With a love so strong, it comes to this
You might also like
Finding my way back to you
(Finding my way back)
Baby, my heart leads me to you
(I'll be finding my way back)
Finding my way back to you
And what I always knew
Loving you could never, never be wrong, oh, ooh, hoo
Finding my way (Finding my way back)
Ooh, oh-oh, oh (I'll be finding my way back)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Finding my way back)
(I'll be finding my way back)

I don't understand why we're apart
Life has no beginning 'til I start

Finding my way (Finding my way back)
Baby, my heart leads me to you
(I'll be finding my way back)
Finding my way back to you
And what I always knew
Loving you could never, never be wrong, oh, oh
Finding my way, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'll be finding my way back)
My heart sings ah-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Finding my way back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'll be finding my way back) Oh, ooh, oh
'Cause I need you, baby
Finding my way back to you
'Cause I'm missing you
Loving you could never, never, never, never be wrong
(Finding my way back)
(I'll be finding my way back)
Can't you hear me calling?
(Finding my way back)
Can't you feel me, can't you hear me calling?
(I'll be finding my way back)
I've been searchin' for so long
(Finding my way back)
Sometimes I feel so all alone
(I'll be finding my way back)
