This mellow jam is for the one
Who knows me from the inside
He always comes around when I wear a frown
And lifts me up from the down side
Savin' the best for later on is his specialty
Just wanna take time out to say, thank you for lovin' me

For every sweet little word you say
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
This uncontrollable smile on my face
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
Thank you for givin' good love to me, constantly, constantly
Just wanna take time out to say, thank you for lovin' me

Can't figure out how he keeps on givin' me good love
(After good love, after good love)
(After good love, after good lovin') like it ain't nothin', no
He can look right in my eyes and see if I'm truly happy
I say with all sincerity, thank you for lovin' me
When everything in my world
Seems like it's all going wrong
And I'm feeling so heavy, heavy
And my way I cannot see
It seems like no one, no one, no one loves me
I know that you love me for all that you say
And in every little thing you do
Thank (thank you, baby) you
You might also like
I can't explain why you give your love
All I know it's all I've ever dreamed of
And the more you give, the more it seems I begin to live
And when the morning comes
I see the sun rushing through our window
All I can do is say thank you, thank you for lovin' me

For every sweet little word you say
Thank you baby, thank you, baby
This uncontrollable smile on my face
Thank you baby, thank you, baby
Thank you for givin' good love to me, constantly, constantly
Just wanna take time out to say, thank you for lovin' me
For every sweet little word you say
Thank you baby, thank you, baby
This uncontrollable smile on my face
Thank you baby, thank you, baby
Thank you for givin' good love to me, constantly, constantly
Just wanna take time out to say, thank you for lovin' me
I (thank you baby, thank you, baby)
Just wanna say thank you, I just wanna say (thank you, baby)
Just wanna say it baby (thank you, baby)
I (thank you baby, thank you, baby)
Just wanna say thank you, I just wanna say
I just wanna thank you baby
The way you love me (thank you, baby)
Just wanna say (thank you, baby)
(Just wanna say thank you)
I just wanna say (thank you, baby)
Just wanna say (thank you, baby)
I (thank you, baby, thank you, baby)
