Heavenly, heavenly, heavenly, heavenly
Heavenly, heavenly, heavenly, heavenly
Heavenly, heavenly, heavenly, heavenly

I want to thank You, heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
You sent me someone who really loves me
And not just my body
He keeps me happy, so very happy
(And loves me), I don't know how to be
It's been a long time since I've had someone who loves me
I owe my thanks to Thee (thank You)

I know it could not happen, without Your love
Ooh, without Your love

It took a long time for it to happen
But I knew those nights I prayed (heavenly Father)
That You would sent me someone who's real
And not someone for play
I kept the faith and didn't worry
My nights grew longer than the days
Until one day it really happened
You sent true love my way (thank You)
You might also like
And I know it could not happen, without You
Ooh, without You

When the time is right, he'll fill Your life, with love and care
Believe, and He'll be there
Just do all right, don't do no wrong and keep the faith
The Lord will shine his light your way
Thank you, Father, for shining Your light on me
(Heavenly, heavenly, heavenly, heavenly)
I prayed a long time for it to happen, I did 'cause I believed
He makes me happy, so very happy, I don't know how to be
It's been a long time, since I've had someone who loves me
I owe my thanks to Thee (thank You)

And I know it could not happen, without You
Ooh, without You

And my nights were long and blue (it could not happen)
Until He sent me you (without You)
Ooh, without You
And my nights were long and blue (it could not happen)
Until He sent me you (without Your love)
Ooh, without Your love
My nights were long and blue (my nights were long and blue)
Until He sent me you (I couldn't live without You)
Ooh, without You, yeah
My nights were long and blue (so blue)
Until He sent me you (I couldn't live without You)
Ooh, without Your love, ooh
And my nights were long and blue (it could not happen)
Until He sent me you (without You)
Ooh, without You, yeah
And my nights were long and blue (it could not happen)
Until He sent me you (without Your love)
Ooh, without Your love, ooh
And my nights were long and blue (it could not happen)
Until He sent me you (without You, without You, without You)
Ooh, without You
And I know it could not happen without You
Oh, ooh
Heavenly, heavenly, heavenly, heavenly

So heavenly, Father
Is the love we share
I thank You
Heavenly Father (Heavenly Father)
For what you've given me
I thank you, Father, Heavenly Father
Heavenly, heavenly, heavenly, heavenly
I wanna thank You, Heavenly Father
With You everything is possible
