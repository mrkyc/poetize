I've gone there with you
Now I've got to U-turn
But, I don't want to because I want you
Carefully, get a hold of yourself, girl
And gather all you gave
It's impossible, irreversible
Time spent with you is gone
But with you our time lives on
Blooming flower cut before its time
Never to be free to breathe in the sun
Blooming flower cut before its time
Never to be free to breathe in the sun

I want the sun to shine on me
I need the sun to shine on our love
Let me feel the warmth of it nourishing our feelin'
In the heat we reflect the light
Shining colors of a love that's ours
Has our time come too late or is it too soon?
Bloom, flower, bloom

And in your eyes I see the places I long to be
I can see and feel you loving me
But, I can't got there, I've got to go
I'm bound on a course set before we met
What can I do with my feelings for you?
Shall I hide them deep inside my heart?
Shall they be placed upon my shelf?
Oh, their eyes would not believe
They could not see the beauty of you and me
Blooming flower cut before its time
Never to be free to breathe in the sun
Never to be free to breathe in the sun
You might also like
I want the sun to shine on me
I need the sun to shine on our love
Let me feel the warmth of it nourishing our feelin'
In the heat we reflect the light
Shining colors of a love that's ours
Has our time come too late or is it too soon?
Bloom, flower, bloom

Bloom, flower, bloom
Bloom, flower, bloom
Flower, bloom, flower
Bloom, flower, bloom
Cut before it's time

I need the sun to shine on me
I need the sun to shine on our love
Let me feel the warmth of it nourishing our feelin'
(Nourishing our feelin')
In the heat we reflect the light
Shining colors of a love that's ours
Has our time come too late or is it too soon?
Bloom, flower, bloom
Shine on me
I need the sun to shine on our love
Let me feel the warmth of it nourishing our feelin'
(Nourishing our feelin')
In the heat we reflect the light
Shining colors of a love that's ours
Has our time come too late or is it too soon?
Bloom, flower, bloom
Bloom, flower, bloom
