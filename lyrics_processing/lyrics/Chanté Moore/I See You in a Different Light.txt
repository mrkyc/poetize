I see you in a different light
Candlelight, Moonlight
I see you in a different way
Through different eyes
And it's so nice

We were just friends
That's how it started
You told me your secrets
And I told you mine
You were always there
With a shoulder to lean on anytime
Now something's changed
Nothing's the same, no, no
You're here beside me

And I see you in a different light
Candlelight, Moonlight
I see you in a different way
Through different eyes
And it's so nice
I see you like I've never seen you before
The way I wanna see you much more
Oh, tonight, tonight
I see you in a different light
You might also like
You were the one I'd always turn to
The one I could talk to
Baby, the one I could trust
Who'd have ever dreamed
We would be here together making love?
The sweetest surprise has come to my life
You're here beside me

And I see you in a different light
Candlelight, Moonlight
I see you in a different way
(Baby, baby)
Through different eyes
And it's so nice
I see you like I've never seen you before
The way I wanna see you much more
Oh, tonight, tonight
I see you in a different light

When did your kisses get so sweet, baby?
It's such a sweet surprise to me
To look into your eyes
And see you in a different light
Candlelight, Moonlight
I see you in a different way
Through different eyes
And it's so nice
I see you like I've never seen you before
The way I wanna see you much more
Tonight, tonight
I see you in a different light
Candlelight, Moonlight
I see you
I see you, baby
Like I've never seen you before
(I see you, baby)
