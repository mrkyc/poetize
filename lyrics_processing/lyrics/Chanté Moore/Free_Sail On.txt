My magic potion for love
Telling him I'm sincere
And that there's nothing too good for us
And I've just got to be
Me, me, me
Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him I'm sincere
And that there's nothing too good for us
But I want to be
Free, free, free
And I've just got to be
Me, me, me
Teasing hands on his mind
Give our nights such mistery
Happiness all the time
Oh, and how that man pleases me
But I want to be
Free, free, free
And I've just got to be
Me, me, me

Feeling you
Close to me
Makes all my senses smile

Let's not waste ecstasy
Cause I'll be only here for a while
I've gotta be
Free, free, free, ooh
And I've just got to be
Me, me, me
Free, free
Free to be me
(And I've just gotta be me)
And I just wanna
I just wanna be me
I've just got to sail on
