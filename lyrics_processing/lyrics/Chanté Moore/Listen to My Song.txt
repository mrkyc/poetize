Throughout the course of your life
Many things are undiscovered
Finding real love in a woman made for you
So, look at me, but not with your eyes
Touch me with more than your hands
Imagine the two, my darling, me and you
In the meadows of some distant land
Imagine, my love, I know that you can

Listen to my song (listen to my song)
This melody of love, this melody's for you
It's a sound of wonder and beauty
My heart beats the rhythm, and it's just for you, for you

When you're all mine, yes I know, we'll move as one
Our bodies keep time, together they grow
Making passionate love, destiny found
I'm feeling your body and I'm loving the sound
Of you saying you love me, in me you discover
I'm always your friend and eternally your lover

Listen to my song (listen to my song)
This melody of love, this melody's for you, baby
Now that you're mine, the love of my life
I am your woman, your lover, your wife, sent from above
Can't believe it's true, baby, close your eyes
Why don't you listen to my song? (listen to my song)
This melody of love, this melody's for you

In me you discover
I'm always your friend and eternally your lover
Listen, listen, listen
Listen to my song, oh
This melody of love, this melody's for you
You, you, you, you
Now that you're mine, the love of my life
I am your woman, your lover, your wife
