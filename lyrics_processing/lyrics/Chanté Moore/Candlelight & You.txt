There's no easy way to explain how I feel for you
So I say with every emotion what falling in love can do
To my romantic heart, you've helped me through the rain
Take me in your arms, I give you control tenderly
Whisper to me, I'm all you need, finally...

Candlelight and you
For all the things that you are to me, and what you do
I want candlelight and you
The end of the day I will faithfully come home to
Candlelight and you
Take everything away from me, what sees me through
Candlelight and you
In all of the world, I know it's true
Nothing compares to candlelight and you

Lady, there's no way to deny that you keep love new
So I'll give you what you desire, I found what I need in you
You can believe in me, and I won't let you down, I'll be here
And I want you to know that I love you
Like no other man could ever, ever do
And I'll keep holding on for candlelight and you
You might also like
Candlelight and you
For all the things that you are to me, and what you do
I want candlelight and you
The end of the day I will faithfully come home to you
Candlelight and you
Take everything away from me, what sees me through
Candlelight and you
In all of the world, I know it's true
Nothing compares to candlelight and you
(Nothing compares to you)

I'm in the mood tonight (oh, babe)
I feel as free as a kiss in the wind, ooh, ooh, baby
And if I had to live my life all over again
What I would do is be with you (you, baby)

Candlelight and you
For all the things that you are to me, and what you do
I want candlelight and you
The end of the day I will faithfully come home to you
Candlelight and you
Take everything away from me and what sees me through
Candlelight and you
In all of the world, I know it's true
Nothing compares to candlelight and you
Tonight is the night (tonight is the night)
Let's turn off the lights (turn off the lights, baby)
I'm in the mood, the mood for you, I get off
Come on, come on, tell me will this be right
I've been waiting on to you, just for you
Let's go, baby
Come on, come on, come on, light a candlelight
Candlelight and you, let's do it right
Give me the love I want from you
Candlelight and you
