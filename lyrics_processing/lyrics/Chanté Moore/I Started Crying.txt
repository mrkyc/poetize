I, I started to cry
I, I started to cry
I started crying, I started crying
I started crying, I started crying
I, I started to cry

Goodnight, baby, I'd rather dream
Than see where we're going awake
(I'd rather be dreaming)
So I close my eyes and fantasize
About our love and the way it used to be
(Candlelight, holding hands, making a lifetime of plans)
We let our desires lead the way
(My house, your car, and then our child)
Oh, what a life!
I, I started to cry
I woke up and started to cry

I started crying, I started crying
I started crying, I started to cry
I started crying, I started crying
I started crying, I, I started to cry
I, I started to cry
You might also like
Tell me, tell me you've got news for me
Tell me that's not the way it has to be
That we can make love like we did before
And make war no more
Now you're kissing me and I like that
Now you're telling me everything is gonna be alright
How our love can be, it can be better than it was before
Tell me, tell me more, tell me more!
You look me in my eyes and tell me you've changed
And tell me I don't ever have to change my name
You smiled at me and then we started to fly
Oh, what a life! I woke up and started to cry

I started crying, I started crying
I started crying, I started to cry
I started crying, I started crying
I started crying, I, I started to cry


I, I started to cry
I started crying, I started crying
I started crying, I started to cry
I started crying, I started crying
I started crying, I, I started to cry
I started crying, I started crying (to cry)
