Back to the way it was

As the clock strikes 12:00 on the wall
I see your eyes are saying
Ooh, let's take it back to the way it was
And how we know it should be
Ooh
We'll turn down the lights real low
Take it nice and slow
We'll make sure the mood is right
As we sit by the fireside
Look into each other eyes
And make love to our favorite song
That's how it was
It's been so long
Since we've been this way
The good times we had somehow strayed away
Let's put our love back
Put loving back how it used to be
In the days of true romancing
You might also like
Give me that old school lovin'
Like you used to do
Give me that old school lovin'
I know you want to
Give me that old school lovin'
In that special way
Old school love
Old school love

Ooh, back in the day
A man would treat a woman
Like he knew he should
On the phone
All night 'til morning light
Surprising her with flowers
That he knows she
She'd go crazy for
Ooh, (it's been so long)
It's been so long since we've been this way
(Since we've been this way)
Times that we had strayed away
Let's put our love back
Put loving back how it used to be
In the days of true romancing

Give me that old school lovin'
Like you used to do
Give me that old school lovin'
I know you want to
(I know you want to, baby)
Give me that old school lovin'
In that special way
(Ooh, in that special way)
Old school love
Old school love
(Old school lovin')
Give me that old school lovin'
Like you used to do
(Give me that, give me that old school lovin')
Give me that old school lovin'
I know you want to
(I know you want to)
Give me that old school lovin'
In that special way
Old school love
Old school lovin'
Ooh
Old school lovin'
Is the way we should be lovin'
When you're treating me the way I like
Ooh
Just like you like it
When I know how you want it
And the way that I do it is the way you like
Old school lovin'
Is the old fashioned way
Like back in the day
Give me that old school lovin'
Like you used to do
Give me that old school lovin'
I know you want to
Give me that old school lovin'
(Give me that, give me that old school lovin')
In that special way
(Give me that, give me that old school lovin')
Old school love
Old school love
Give me that old school lovin'
(Old school lovin')
Like you used to do
(Old school lovin')
Give me that old school lovin'
(Ooh, yeah)
I know you want to
(Ooh, yeah)
Give me that old school lovin'
In that special way
Old school love
Old school love
Give me that old school lovin'
Like you used to do
Give me that old school lovin'
I know you want to
Give me that old school lovin'
In that special way
