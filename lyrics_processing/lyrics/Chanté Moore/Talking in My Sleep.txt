So, baby, now that you know
Maybe I'm a little bit guilty
When he walks by I hope it don't show
When my thoughts get a little bit filthy
I said I keep that door closed
Baby, even if it kills me
But I guess it don't matter now
Always wonder what you'd do, if I had to tell you
If you couldn't face the truth, then silence is better
Loving you, I always give you my best
So how did you guess?

Baby, I've been talking in my sleep
I know that you can see it on my face
That I'm hiding all the secrets that I keep
But now you know there's someone else
Wish you'd never seen into my dreams
'Cause in reality I'd never cross that line
So why do my fantasies have to be goodbye?
I'm only talking in my sleep

I wish I woulda kept my mouth shut
In the middle of the night
Maybe we dun' gon' and slipped up
Is there something missing in my life?
Just a little look and don't touch
Is all that I'm guilty of
But maybe that's too much

Baby, I've been talking in my sleep
I know that you can see it on my face

Wish you'd never seen into my dreams

So why do my fantasies have to be goodbye?
I'm only talking in my sleep

Tell me, please
Don't you still know what you mean to me?
How could you give up on meant to be?
'Cause to me it's such a mystery
I can't believe you wanna leave
Just because I've been...

Baby, I've been talking in my sleep
I know that you can see it on my face
That I'm hiding all the secrets that I keep
I've seen you watching someone else
Wish you'd never seen into my dreams
'Cause in reality I know you'd cross that line
So why do my fantasies have to be goodbye?
