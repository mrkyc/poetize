Oh what can I tell you now, Caroline?
Should I hurt your feelings or keep on lyin'?
One thing leads to another and another
And another and another besides
You always know whenever I wanna make love
And you always know all the changes I'm going through
Just as if you can read my mind
Caroline, you know everything I do
Oh, there just ain't no words to describe
How I feel inside for you

Yet somewhere out there
Waitin' on a wonder
You'll lend wings to my words
Somewhere when the band is gone
And the music of my song
Is just right for lovers

You're what I want more than anything else
Ooh I love you, yeah I do, but I know when I'm all by myself
Nothin' is real but my feelings and desires for you
'Cause everything looks like some sort of scenery
Stored in an empty theatre
With stars on the ground, fences in the sky
And tears in the curtain of time
Oh what can I tell you now, my Caroline?

Except that somewhere out there
Ah, waitin' on a wonder
You'll lend wings to my words
Somewhere (Somewhere) when the band is gone
And the music of my song
Is just right for lovers

Oh, and your lovin' keeps on rollin'
Oh Caroline, your lovin' keeps me rollin'
Rollin' all the time
Yeah now now baby, ooh, somewhere out there
You really roll me (Roll me away) you roll me away (Yeah)
Now now baby, ooh, somewhere out there
You really roll me (Roll me away) you roll me away, now now
Yeah, now when the melody makes me surrender
Dark eyed girl, I always remember
That you love me somewhere out there
You really love me in time to the music
How you love me wildly in my heart
Girl, you love me
You roll me away

You always fill my heart with wonder
You always fill my soul with love
You always fill my lips with kisses
You always fill my eyes with tears, yeah
Oh, yes you do now now
Oh, yes you do now
It's like a wind from the other side of the world
Like a far off pack of hounds
Sounds like the whole universe
Just a-throbbin' with life
Oh, the lights from my eyes hypnotize me
Like the gaze of a mantis
Why even Atlantis
Sank beneath the waves in a day and a night
Oh, but in a day and a night
I could write you a symphony
It would be just like a bird
And carry my love over the mountains

'Cause somewhere out there
Waitin' on a wonder
You'll lend wings to my words
Somewhere (Somewhere) when the band is gone
And the music of my song
Is just right for lovers
(Oh, yeah now, oh now now now)

Yeah, you always fill my heart with wonder
You always fill my soul with love
You always fill my lips with kisses
You always fill my eyes with tears
Oh I cry Caroline
Oh I cry Caroline
Oh now cry now now
