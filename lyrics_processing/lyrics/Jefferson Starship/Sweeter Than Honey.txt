Baby, if I had your lovin', I'd have everything I needed
If anybody told me I wouldn'a believed that I'd be
Head over heels in love with you baby
Now all the unfinished dreams on the unmade beds
Are ungathered blackberries in my head
Baby, I know I really am in love with you

'Cause you're sweeter than honey, baby
Oh, warm as a piece of the sun and
Darker than night to a blind man
Softer than starlight shinin'

So let's get together and make love
Ain't nothing else to be prouder of
I need you bad, baby
You're the best thing I ever had
If you can do it, you can get it
You can bet, I'm gonna get your everlastin' love
Gotta be more where that came from, baby
Gotta get me some, gotta get me some

'Cause it's sweeter than honey, baby
Warm as a piece of the sun, yeah
Darker than night to a blind man
Softer than starlight shinin'

Baby, I love you
I can't dance you outta my mind
I hear shoutin' in my heart
When you're in these arms of mine
When you satisfy my days and nights
Gratify my appetites
I never felt so good
Must be your lovin', baby
Must be your lovin'
