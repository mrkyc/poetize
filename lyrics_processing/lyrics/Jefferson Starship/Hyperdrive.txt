I never thought there were corners in time
'Til I was told to stand in one
One straight line head on into the other
Maybe standing in a corner looks like where it's got to come

But I'll pretend one wall is the past and one is the future
And I'll stand here like the present looking for a good place to run
Every fish that swims upstream now that's a catch
Because the full mouth never wants to stop cooking

The map may be flat and the globe may be patched
But the long line keeps right on hooking
Circles in the ring of fire, where do you go
On a night that is clear and warm?
Oh where do you go?

I never thought there were corners in time
'Til I was told to stand in one
I've heard circles moving right through corners
And they don't even know they've been around
And around and around before
Ringing, ringing against each other on a singing chain
Like a flying magnet
Hyperdrive has never seen any reason to remain the same

Oh, because I felt it
Oh, I believe it
There are things I've never seen that I believe
So I'm going to place my face
Right in the triangle door
'Til I can move right on through
Instead of just standing here
Looking at the floor
And it rains again tonight
I can think light years ahead
Or I could put myself back
A thousand years ago
As if I'd always been here before
Or as if I am still to be born
I'm a slow loser
But I'm a fast learner
That much I know
Anyone can go
That much I know
Anyone can go
That much I know
