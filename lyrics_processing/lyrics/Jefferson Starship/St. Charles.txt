Dream
You know I saw her in a dream
Oh, St. Charles sings
Sings about love
St. Charles, tell me tonight
Won't you tell me 'bout love
You know I saw her in a dream
There was China, in her eyes
In a silk and velvet disguise
She was movin' like a lady
Lookin' like a dragon princess
She was walkin'
Walkin' by the river
Rollin' in a rhythm of love
I never felt like this before;
I'll never stop, I just want more
Oh, St. Charles sings
Sings about love
St. Charles, tell me tonight
Won't you tell me 'bout love
You know I saw her in a dream
I was shang-hied by her way
Hypnotized by the things she would say
In the moonlight on the water
We were like lovers in another lifetime
Woh, is it only a vision?
Ah, it feels like a prison
Just the spell of a demon and I can't get away
Oh, St. Charles sings
Sings about love
St. Charles, tell me tonight
Won't you tell me 'bout love
Please tell me 'bout love
I saw her in a dream
Please tell me 'bout love
I know I saw her in a dream...
Dream...
Let me take you
To another place
Another time
Another world of people, dancin' in rhyme
Dance in the air, six-fingered webbed
Fair as the air
She is the storm bringer, yeh
The storm changer. yeh
Tie, yourself down to the main mast
Tie, yourself down to the main mast
Like Ulysses in the water storm
Winds comin' down the main line
Tie, yourself down to the main mast
Tie it down with love
Tie it down with love
Don't you feel it, stormin'?
I feel it coming, stormin'
I can feel it now, stormin'
Don't you feel it comin', stormin'?
Arhhhhhh...
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
Stormin'
