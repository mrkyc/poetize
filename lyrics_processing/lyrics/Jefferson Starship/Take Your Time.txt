I'm gonna get two days for the price of one
There's a one word rhyme
And that's called living
There's a one word love
Means plenty of giving
I'm gonna give it 'til I'm done
But everybody keeps telling me to take it easy
But time doesn't sit down and wait
While I'm trying to get it done
But you're not me, thank god
You can take your time slowly
Makes me fell good just to watch
You lie down and have your fun
Take your time
Take your time
And I'll take my own time
Take your time
Take your time
And I'll take my own time
Take your time
Take your time
And I'll take my own time
I can take it slowly or you can keep runnin' on runnin' on
When I put one foot in front of the other
To me that doesn't mean walk that means run
I always want to start the race
Before the gates open
I always want to start the race
Before I hear the sound of the gun
But everybody keeps tellin' me to take it easy
But time doesn't sit down and wait
While I'm trying to get it done
But you're not me, thank god
You can take your time slowly
Makes me fell good just to watch
You lie down and have your fun

You say it'll take a you year
I say just take me a second
But there's room for both of us
Just open the room
You know a year of time sees so many changes
And the speed of light in the black of night
