A song of the Fremen 
Camps near the river
After the fall -- Before the Beginning
We build the watchfire every night
We control the water flow
We control the power from fusion
Reactor #12
The walls of the city crumble
I would sing a song fifty feet long
Sweet breezes on pine beaches
The sound of fire
Let it shine Let it shine Let it shine
Shut down the city lights I want to be with my lady
Build up the watchfires turn down the sun
I been too long in the green fields of rapture
I been too long without bein' on the run
Carry the fire from the heart of your lover
Carry the fire where the wild things run
There's a monster lurking deep in the forest
Let's go and get him when the mornin' comes
Rose I need you
Rose Can't go without your love
Rose I need you
I can't go without you
I won't go without your love

Remember the miracles and all the crazy chances we took on
Love, Love, Love -- I want to go beyond
Love, Love, Love ------ let's go
Inside the walls of forbidden halls
Beyond everything I've ever hoped or sung
Carry the fire -- Beyond all desire
Carry the fire -- Brighter than the sun
Rose
Lightning Rose
Rose
I won't leave without you
I can't go without your love
Love is a fire in the Rose
She rocks me
Shut down the city lights I want to be with my baby
Build up the watchfires turn down the sun
Rose I need to feel you near me
Lightning Rose I need you to be strong
Come together warm around the watchfire
Come together till the mornin' sun
Open the floodgates and let loose the waters
Stand by the banks and watch the water run
Carry the fire to the heart of the darkness
Carry the fire each and every one
Carry the fire in your hands if you need to
Carry the fire the fire the fire
Let it shine Let it shine
Look into the night sky
