Whatever I see, I will see you in it
Whatever I do, there will be love in it
Even when I close my eyes
All I see is you
Oh, oh, the sunshine of your smile
Oh, oh, the music of your voice
Oh, oh, when you lay your body by
Oh, oh, the night was made for love
Oh, baby, the way we move in love
Oh, baby, the way we movin'
Oh, baby, the way we move in love
Oh, baby, the way we movin' now
Whatever I do, there will be love in it
Whatever I see, I will see you in it
Whatever I do, there will be love in it
Even when I close my eyes
All I see is you
And I could fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
I made an ark from the light of the stars
And I hewed two mesas of bright silver metal
That sang in the sun like a sail in the wind
And I weave my way back to you
Now I can fly
