In the heart of the glowing city
She stood
Pen in hand
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalala
Go and find Rose and ask her 'bout order
Go and find Rose and ask her 'bout Yale
There is no more Yale (yaaaaaa!)
There is no more order (yaaaaaay!)
I was out on the river
And in the darkness before me
In the light of the domed city
I saw Rose Lightning Rose
She wasn't perfect
But she was semi-perfect
And she remembered all about her days in Yale
Before they turned it into a sheet
Of radio-active glass
Thirty miles across
And I always used to want to think if we could sing
Loudly enough
If we could sing strong enough
And if we could sing
Hopefully enough
Then all of this madness would disappear
And if we could sing
Long enough
If we could sing strong enough
And if we could sing true enough
It might carry us through next year

Go and find Rose and ask about nuclear
Go and find Rose and ask her "What now?"
She'll tell you 'bout future
She'll tell you 'bout how to live beyond the pale
When the time comes...seize it
When the dream starts....believe in it
When the light shines...oh, bathe in it
And now we'll have to be
Strong enough
Have to work long enough
And if we believe
True enough
Then much of this madness'll disappear
I'll be the one
She said
I'll be the only one
In the aftermath of atomic fire
I'll carry us through next year
Lalalalalalala

What if the world was turned around
What if nuclear plants worked
What if nuclear bombs didn't
What if they held nuclear disarmament
Talks in Antarctica instead of Switzerland
(In igloos, not fancy hotels!) They'd be
Over and done
In six hours, and be on their way home
Imagine, the light
And imagined that Rose was here tonight
And there in her eyes
Was a reason to live
A reason to fight
A reason to die
It scared me....it elevated me
I would do things for her
That I wouldn't do for my mother
My country
My lover
Tis of thee
I sing
Sweet girl of liberty
