Don't make this about you
I'm just telling you how I feel
Why you gotta push me, closer to the edge when I'm barely holding on, to us?
So, how bad you wanna be right?
And how much more you wanna prove me wrong?
Do you feel validated when you're sleeping alone
And you're reaching out for someone to touch?
You put up a good fight and nobody's swinging on you
You put me so right but I know you don't really want to
I wanna change the subject, but you won't let up, this is too much
And every time I wanna leave girl, you be like hold up, hold up

You keep asking are we good?
Should I walk away for good?
Your independent heart is slowly tearing mine apart
When you ask me, do I love you? Just don't know

Tell me why do you cry now?
When I came face to face with reality
Uh, you're always double meaning
And it's tearing down, do you want me to let you go home for good?
Is this love still serving, if everything you care is broken
Give me what we're left with, girl I feel like my heart is frozen
Should I release you? Gotta figure it out
Gotta make up my mind, my mind eh eh

You keep asking are we good?
Should I walk away for good?
Your independent heart is slowly tearing mine apart
When you ask me, do I love you? Just don't know

I don't understand it, what you get me in this for?
I gave you all of me, I can't give no more
Looking for that silver lining cause you and I can't stand this way
I've reached the breaking point and love's tearing me
When you're asking me we're good
Should've walk away for good
Your independent heart is tearing mine apart
So you ask me why I love you

You keep asking are we good?
Should I walk away for good?
Your independent heart is slowly tearing mine apart
