If you run the game like who is it, babe?
Who's got attention like I'm not here right in front of you
Should I take the hint and give you space?
Baby, let you go, but it's your heart I don't wanna lose
You smile, meanwhile, I'm the one that's left in the dark
You are searching, is it worth it for us to be to how we fall apart?

So this is how, this is how you think of all
Right down the middle, you tear it up
Just like that, you're switching up
What about us?
He's feeding you lies girl, he's feeding you lies
You're living it up like it's the best you've ever had in your life
And why girl? I thought you were mine
I lost my appetite, just from watching this, I'm sick girl
I'll tell you what the truth is, truth is, truth
He don't love you, so the truth is, truth is, truth
Girl, I do, and the truth is, truth is you and me forever
That's what the truth is, truth is, truth

Should I get mad and go crazy babe?
But I know the game, I can't let this get the best of me
You believe the stories he's telling you and you know me better than him
Plus you are my everything
You changed my life babe
Can't even look me in the face
You're hurting, I can't fix it
Instead of doing the things babe
You might also like
So this is how, this is how you think of all
Right down the middle, you tear it up
Just like that, you're switching up
What about us?
He's feeding you lies girl, he's feeding you lies
You're living it up like it's the best you've ever had in your life
And why girl? I thought you were mine
I lost my appetite, just from watching this, I'm sick girl
I'll tell you what the truth is, truth is, truth
He don't love you, so the truth is, truth is, truth
Girl, I do, and the truth is, truth is you and me forever
That's what the truth is, truth is, truth

Why would you think that it's good for you?
Always alone and by yourself
Won't even answer his phone, who you talking to?
When there ain't nobody there to tell
He don't even wanna take you out, all he do is let you down
You was looking for a new start and you messed up with a broken heart
See it's not greener on the other side
You were never his, you were always mine

Truth is, truth is, truth
He don't love you, so the truth is, truth is, truth
Girl, I do, and the truth is, truth is you and me forever
That's what the truth is, truth is, truth
Truth is, truth is, truth
He don't love you, so the truth is, truth is, truth
Girl, I do, and the truth is, truth is you and me forever
