Here it is, here it is

Hands in the air, are you ready for a good time tonight, tonight?
Life isn't fair, so let's make it feel good tonight, tonight
Grab your pretty girls, make them dance with you
Let them see you flying, you're the one to choose
Hands in the air, here moving them side to side tonight

You wanna get it like me, we rock it, we rock it, we rock it, we rock it
Get it like me, we pop it, we pop it, we pop it, we pop it
Get it like me, we balling, we balling, we balling, we balling
Get it like me, hands in the air

This is in the air, if you're bad enough you gotta let them go, let them go
You ain't gonna get them here, it's your moment to lose control
If you love yourself, take him by the hand
If you think you're hard then  make them understand, oh
Hands in the air, we up in here 'til it's time to close, time to close

You wanna get it like me, we rock it, we rock it, we rock it, we rock it
Get it like me, we pop it, we pop it, we pop it, we pop it
Get it like me, we balling, we balling, we balling, we balling
Get it like me, hands in the air

Raising the roof like we own this club
Living it up like we can't get enough
Love, there's not such thing as too much
Feeling my spirit, so put your hands up
Raising the roof like we own this club
Living it up like we can't get enough
Love, there's not such thing as too much
Feeling my spirit, so put your hands up
Here it is, here it is
Put your hands up
Here it is, here it is

You wanna get it like me, we rock it, we rock it, we rock it, we rock it
Get it like me, we pop it, we pop it, we pop it, we pop it
Get it like me, we balling, we balling, we balling, we balling
