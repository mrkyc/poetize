If ever there's a moment that you feel by yourself
Remember I'm just a phone call away
If there's emptiness inside, I'll hold your hand
You can wipe those tears from your face
Together we try, together we fight

If the world's too much to handle, it's not the end
If friends let you down, I promise, it's not the end
If love breaks your heart, I'm telling you it's not the end
Don't look back, don't look back
We've got a long way to go and we've come too far
I can feel it, girl, we're almost home
Don't you ever think that we won't make it cause it's not the end
If I know anything, I know it's not the end

Let's take this pride, and just throw it away
It's the one thing that could tear us apart
Holding on to nothing, let everything go
None of this is who we are
Together we stand, with our life in our hands

If the world's too much to handle, it's not the end
If friends let you down, I promise, it's not the end
If love breaks your heart, I'm telling you it's not the end
Don't look back, don't look back
We've got a long way to go and we've come too far
I can feel it, girl, we're almost home
Don't you ever think that we won't make it cause it's not the end
If I know anything, I know it's not the end
You might also like
I know I've made mistakes, but I can't take them back
It's not the end of the road, I know
You can make a choice, only how the story ends
Just take back control

If the world's too much to handle, it's not the end
If friends let you down, I promise, it's not the end
If love breaks your heart, I'm telling you it's not the end
Don't look back, don't look back
We've got a long way to go and we've come too far
I can feel it, girl, we're almost home
Don't you ever think that we won't make it cause it's not the end
