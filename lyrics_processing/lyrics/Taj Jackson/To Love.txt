I don't even know how to begin this
Feels like we are way past apologies and forgiveness
I just wanna know what's love friendly in this?
All I know is that it hurts, oh
Why ain't nobody helping me get through this?
It's like nothing ever goes my way when I do it
I'm taking to the earth goes and that's where the truth is
All I know is that it hurts, oh

I wanna see, you had your worst, bring you home and fill up the speed
Where you've been missing girl, you've been missing girl, I just need you to listen, girl
How did you get so far away? Used to be so happy, this is all I'm saying
I ain't giving up, I just want someone, to love, to love, to love

I'm looking at this distance
When we're in the same room and this pain feels persistent
Dealing with these tears, and ow I'm wishing
We could make it work
Oh, and I know what I don't want
I know that I don't want you walking out on love
I've sacrificed and I'm ready to sacrifice some more
Please just stay for me cause I'm tired of the hurt

I wanna see, you had your worst, bring you home and fill up the speed
Where you've been missing girl, you've been missing girl, I just need you to listen, girl
How did you get so far away? Used to be so happy, this is all I'm saying
I ain't giving up, I just want someone, to love, to love, to love
How did you get so far away? Used to be so happy, this is all I'm saying
I ain't giving up, I just want someone, to love, to love, to love

How I'm supposed to make it better?
Stuck in wet season, rain is the weather
I can't even think about us not being together
Praying for the sun
Love should be right here with that column
You and I against the world, real to be honest
Tell me what to do girl and you know I'll run it
Why you call it down when you know that I'm the one?
Love should be right here with that column
You and I against the world, just to be honest
Tell me what to do girl and you know I'll run it
Why you call it down when you know that I'm the one?

I wanna see, you had your worst, bring you home and fill up the speed
Where you've been missing girl, you've been missing girl, I just need you to listen, girl
How did you get so far away? Used to be so happy, this is all I'm saying
