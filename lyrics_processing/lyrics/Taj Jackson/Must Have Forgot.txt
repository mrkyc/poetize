Why you looking at me like you don't know who I am?
Like the mistakes I've made makes me less of a man?
If you're ready to walk, girl, you might wanna think twice
I don't live in the past like you, must've clean up nice

I don't know what made you think I fall apart if you're not there
Baby, you don't seem to be well

I don't never sleep down, never been the one to just lay down and die
I can never let them won, I might not know cause you must have forgot
I'm the king of my town, haters let me disappoint you one more time
Should've never get upon me, I don't know how you see it cause you must have forgot

I've been at the bottom, it ain't no place for me
But I dream so big with you, it's hard to see
Cause you're live in your world, you think you're right
But I'm somebody that wants their life, I'm good if you wanna stay for the ride

I don't know what made you think I fall apart if you're not there
Baby, you don't seem to be well

I don't think you're understanding me, oh yeah
I must see what you don't see
Wish you could come with me
I must see what you don't see
I wish you could've believed

I don't never sleep down, never been the one to just lay down and die
I can never let them won, I might not know cause you must have forgot
I'm the king of my town, haters let me disappoint you one more time
Should've never get upon me, I don't know how you see it cause you must have forgot
