Can't imagine life on my own
And living day by day without you
I can't imagine being enemies
You kissing on somebody new

Shallow breathing cause you used to be my air
And how you've always been there for me
I just want a chance to get back to me
You know, before you threw them deuces at me

You deserve more
Everything you need, that's what I'mma bring
You deserve more
Whatever makes you cry, take it out your life
All the stars in the universe, I'mma lay them at your feet
Do this all for my baby
You deserve more
Starting right now, I won't let you down

Cause I wanna make it right
And I need you to feel what I'm saying
I've had it more than it shows
But you need to know it's me that I'm blaming
You might also like
Shallow breathing cause you used to be my air
And how you've always been there for me
I just want a chance to get back to the man
You said you loved for eternity

You deserve more
Everything you need, that's what I'mma bring
You deserve more
Whatever makes you cry, take it out your life
All the stars in the universe, I'mma lay them at your feet
Do this all for my baby
You deserve more
Starting right now, I won't let you down

We can make it work even though it hurts
Get back to the love instead of let's making it work
We can make it work even though it hurts
Get back to the love instead of let's making it work
Cause you are my heart
A shining star
Cause you are my heart
A shining star
You deserve more
Everything you need, that's what I'mma bring
You deserve more
Whatever makes you cry, take it out your life
All the stars in the universe, I'mma lay them at your feet
Do this all for my baby
You deserve more
