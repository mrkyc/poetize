Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to the wide, wonderful world
Of everything you ever wanted
And so, so much more
Come touch, feel and experience
The wide, wonderful world
Of all your dreams
You got too much food
Too much wine
Too many assholes
Tryin' to feel fine
Too much God
Too much beer
And too many heads
Selling the fear, yeah
Too much blood
And too much war
And too many babies
For the TV whore, yeah
Everything is nice and clean
Everything's a teenage dream
Everything is crashing down
Everything is boring now

That's right, you've got fifteen minutes
To show us what you've got
Then we're going to ship you off to the garbage dump
Where you can spend the rest of your life living in shame
That's right, living in shame, ha ha ha
Yeah, mushroom clouds
Electric chairs
Fifteen minutes
Then no one cares
Yeah, too much fuck
And too much gash
And too much death
Making all that cash
Get it undone, get it undone, get it done
Get it undone, get it undone, ain't it fun
Get it undone, get it undone, get it done
Get it undone, get it undone, ain't it fun
Everything is nice and clean
Everything's a teenage dream
