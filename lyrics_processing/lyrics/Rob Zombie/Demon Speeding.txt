Why don't you ask me what it feels like to be a freak!

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey, do ya love me, I'm untouchable darkness
A dirty black river to-a get you through this
Hey, do ya love me, I'm a devil machine
(Hey, do ya love me, I'm a devil machine)
Get into my world, all-American dream

In the mouth of madness
Down in the darkness
No more tomorrow
Down in the hollow

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey, do ya love it when the kids are screaming?
Wrecking on the road, violate their dreaming
Hey, do ya love to see the filth in the clean, yeah
(Hey, do ya love to see the filth in the clean, yeah)
Get into the gone all-American dream

In the mouth of madness
Down in the darkness
No more tomorrow
Down in the hollow
