Ow, she's a brick house
Yeah, she's mighty mighty
Just letting it all hang out
Ah, she's a brick house
I like ladies stacked
That's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back
Ow, she's a brick house
Well put together, everybody knows
This is how the story goes

She knows she's got everything
That a woman needs to get a man, hey, hey, hey
How can she lose with the stuff she use?
36-24-36, what a winning hand

Ow, she's a brick house
Yeah, she's mighty mighty
Just letting it all hang out
Ah, she's a brick house
Well she's the one, only one
Built like an amazon

Mmm, the clothes she wear, her sexy ways
Make an old man wish, for younger days, wow, wow
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure enough can knock a strong man to his knees

Ow, she's a brick house
Yeah, she's mighty mighty
Just letting it all hang out
Ah, she's a brick house
Lady's stacked, that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

Shaka gah shaka now now
Shaka gah shaka dow now
Shaka gah shaka dow now
Ah, ah, ah, yeah

I'm the chick from the South, built like a brick house
Bad to the bone, fatty girl stallion
Brick house amazon
I stay fly yo
With a body that a grown man would cry for
When I walk, niggas whistle
I keep 'em hotter than a missile
When I'm doing my thizzle
36-24-36
Hands on my hip when I walk with a switch
A Gaultier dress, Ferragamo stilettos
Classy but you can tell I'm still ghetto
Prada this, Escada this
Fit slim in the waist with a lot in the back, woah
Petite but I'm thick to death
I'm the baddest bitch
Y'all can keep the rest
Brick house and my walk is mean
And I stay on the scene so fresh, so clean
Ow, she's a brick house
Yeah, she's mighty mighty
Just letting it all hang out
Ah, she's a brick house
I like ladies stacked
That's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back
Ow, she's a brick house
Well she's the one, only one
