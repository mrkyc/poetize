It feels like a golden age
There's no need to be afraid
(Hey!) You run the run
And I could pick you up
When your color starts to fade
(Let's get lost!)
I could be your secret savior
So get up off your knees
'Cause I could set you free
(Let's get lost!)
You're a misbehavior generator
So get up off your knees
'Cause I could set you free
(Hey!) We light it up
I got you hypnotized
These technicolor nights
(Hey!) Fill up your eyes
And don't apologize
If you're feeling paralyzed
(Let's get lost!)
I could be your secret savior
So get up off your knees
'Cause I could set you free
(Let's get lost!)
You're a misbehavior generator
So get up off your knees
'Cause I could set you free

We can run, we can run, we can run, we can run, oh
(Let's get lost!)
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
We can run, we can run, we can run, we can run, oh
(Let's get lost!)
Even when your walls are closing in
You can keep everything underneath your skin
Think of all the love you could have left
A million miles away
(Let's get lost!)
I could be your secret savior
So get up off your knees
'Cause I could set you free
(Let's get lost!)
You're a misbehavior generator
So get up off your knees
'Cause I could set you free
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
We can run, we can run, we can run, we can run, oh
(Let's get lost!)
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
We can run, we can run, we can run, we can run, oh
