I sit around and wait for the lights to go down
Tell me what you need
We can work it out
'Cause everybody knows I don't want you right now
So tell me if you're coming out tonight
I want to be there with you
You know I love it when you come to life
And we've got nothing to lose
With every breath you take
I can hear every word you say
So tell me if you're coming out tonight
'Cause you make me feel so high high high
'Cause you make me feel so high high high
Can you let me in if I take you home
I'm never giving up 'cause I can't let go
I feel it in the air, feel it in my bones
We're meant to be together like silver and gold
So tell me if you're coming out tonight
I want to be there with you
You know I love it when you come to life
And we've got nothing to lose
With every breath you take
I can hear every word you say
So tell me if you're coming out tonight
'Cause you make me feel so high high high
'Cause you make me feel so high high high
'Cause you make me feel so high high high
'Cause you make me feel so high high high
