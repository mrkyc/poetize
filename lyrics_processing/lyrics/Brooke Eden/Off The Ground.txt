I got two points of view
Life before and after you
Came around, turned me upside down
Love-stoned, I'll never touch
This kind of buzz don't sober up
Ain't no gravity when you're next to me

I love the way you got me
Levitatin', losin' my mind
It's out of body, baby
No one gets me this high
The day we met, you had my future
Takin' all of my time
Take me up to the clouds
Love me right off the ground

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Love me right off the ground

I feel bad, folks down there
They don't get to share the air
That I do way up here with you
You got me out of this world
I'm talkin' Jupiter, girl
Closest I've ever been to heaven, baby
You might also like
I love the way you got me (Oh woah)
Levitatin', losin' my mind (Oh woah)
It's out of body, baby
No one gets me this high
The day we met, you had my future (Ooh, ooh)
Takin' all of my time (Ooh)
Take me up to the clouds (To the clouds)
Love me right off the ground

Love me, love me right
Love me, love me right
Love me, love me
Love me right off the ground

I love the way you got me (I love it, baby)
Levitatin', losin' my mind
It's out of body, baby
No one gets me this high (Nobody gets me this high)
The day we met, you had my future
Takin' all of my time (You got my future, baby)
Take me up to the clouds
Love me right off the ground
I love the way you got me (Oh woah)
Levitatin', losin' my mind (Oh woah)
It's out of body, baby (You got me levitatin')
No one gets me this high
The day we met, you had my future (Ooh, ooh)
Takin' all of my time (Ooh)
Take me up to the clouds (To the clouds)
Love me right off the ground
Love me, love me right (Love me)
Love me, love me right (Love me right)
Love me, love me
Love me right off the ground

I love it, baby
I love it, baby
