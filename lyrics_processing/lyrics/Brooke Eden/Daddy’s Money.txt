I'm a proud daughter of a blue collar, hard workin' father
Bills piled up at the end of the month took just about every dollar
No silver spoon but the right attitude for gettin' it on my own, yeah

I ain't ever had daddy's money
Didn't come from the land of milk and honey
Everything I got, I got workin' to the bone to the bone to the bone
I ain't takin', I'm makin' my livin'
What's mine is mine, it ain't ever been given
I got it all honey, but I ain't ever had daddy's money, no

Daddy said "You're grown"
So I left home the second I turned eighteen
Moved to the city
Livin' on pennies and the hope of the American dream
Now I ain't hatin' on a trust fund
Baby, I just wasn't that fortunate

I ain't ever had daddy's money
Didn't come from the land of milk and honey
Everything I got, I got workin' to the bone to the bone to the bone
I ain't takin', I'm makin' my livin'
What's mine is mine, it ain't ever been given
I got it all honey, but I ain't never had daddy's money, no

So this is for the girls all around the town
Whose daddies don't have it to throw it around
Don't let it hold you up
Don't let it slow you down

I ain't ever had daddy's money
Didn't come from the land of milk and honey
Everything I got, I got workin' to the bone to the bone to the bone,bone, bone
I ain't takin', I'm makin' my livin'
What's mine is mine, it ain't ever been given
I got it all honey, but I ain't ever had daddy's money, no

I ain't ever had daddy's money
