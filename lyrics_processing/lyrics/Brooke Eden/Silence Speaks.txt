I can be a mess, I can go to my best friend's house
We can eat ice cream on the couch
I can cry all night, lose sleep, feeling sorry for myself
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can carve my name in the side of your brand new truck
I can call your new girl, I can tell her what's up
Set your house on fire, call your mama
Say I'm sorry that her son's a liar

But I won't, 'cause I ain't crazy
I'm a classy lady and I ain't wasting
No more time on you
I bet you're expecting some psycho ex-girlfriend
But I don't need words when silence speaks louder than
I hate you, I never wanna see you again
And hell no sugar we ain't never gonna be friends, no

I know you're waiting for my drunk dial
Saying come and pick me up from the bar
'Cause I'm lonely and I need your love
I want you back, you're the best I've ever had and all that
But no-oh-oh-oh
You might also like
But I won't, 'cause I ain't crazy
I'm a classy lady and I ain't wasting
No more time on you
I bet you're expecting some psycho ex-girlfriend
But I don't need words when silence speaks louder than
I hate you, I never wanna see you again
And hell no sugar we ain't never gonna be friends, no

I said I hate you, I never wanna see you again
And hell no sugar we ain't never gonna be friends
I could forgive and forget and take you back
And act like this ain't never happened

But I ain't crazy
I'm a classy lady and I ain't wasting
No more time on you
I bet you're expecting some psycho ex-girlfriend
But I don't need words when silence speaks louder than
