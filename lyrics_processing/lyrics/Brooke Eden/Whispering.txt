"Best friends" back then's what we called it
'Til we had no choice but to fall in
Keepin' a secret was fun 'til it wasn't
So I went and kissed you in public

Oh, let 'em talk, talk, talk
'Bout what we got, got, got
While we walk, walk, walk away

We're the reason they been starin' since we walked in the door
The reason that their jaws keep droppin' through the floor
Our name's on their lips while my hand's on your hips
This whole town's talkin' and they don't know the half of it
Say it one more time, we ain't even listenin'
Baby, I don't mind, we're the reason why they're whisperin'

They say we're crazy and we'll never work out
That kinda love don't fit in the south
If I'm a rebel, at least I got a cause
So let 'em talk, talk, talk

We're the reason they been starin' since we walked in the door
The reason that their jaws keep droppin' through the floor
Our name's on their lips while my hand's on your hips
This whole town's talkin' and they don't know the half of it
Say it one more time, we ain't even listenin'
Baby, I don't mind, we're the reason why they're whisperin'

Ooh, the reason why they're whisperin'
Yeah

Oh, let 'em talk, talk, talk
'Bout what we got, got, got
While we walk, walk, walk away
Let 'em talk, talk, talk
'Bout what we got, got, got
While we walk, walk, walk away

We're the reason they been starin' since we walked in the door (Oh)
The reason that their jaws keep droppin' through the floor (Uh-huh)
Our name's on their lips while my hand's on your hips
This whole town's talkin' and they don't know the half of it
Say it one more time, we ain't even listenin'
Baby, I don't mind, we're the reason why they're whisperin'

Yeah, yeah
The reason why they're whisperin'
