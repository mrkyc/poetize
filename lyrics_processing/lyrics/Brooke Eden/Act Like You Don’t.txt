We can't take all these ups and downs
This back and forth
Oh, space is what we need
So I boxed up your things
Put them on your porch
The nights, they hurt like hell
I know just how you feel
But when I hear from you
It's like salt in the wound
And I need to heal

So when you want to have a late night drive by
And drunk dial my phone around midnight
Say you miss me waking up by your side
Act like you don't, like you don't
Let's play a little game and pretend
Like you don't know where I go on the weekends
When you want to show up with your friends
Act like you don't, like you don't

I know we both get lonely
But if you ever loved me
And you still do
I need you to
Act like you don't
Pretend you don't
You might also like
When I smell a stranger
Wearing your cologne
It's like poison to me
Yeah, I can't breathe
But I don't want to go home, alone
Your memory is haunting me
Yeah, we try real hard
But we're better apart
We're not what we need

So when you want to have a late night drive by
And drunk dial my phone around midnight
Say you miss me waking up by your side
Act like you don't, like you don't
Let's play a little game and pretend
Like you don't know where I go on the weekends
When you want to show up with your friends
Act like you don't, like you don't

I know we both get lonely
But if you ever loved me
And you still do
I need you to
Act like you don't
Act like you don't, act like you don't (oh)
Act like you don't, act like you don't (oh)
Act like you don't, act like you don't (oh, oh)
Act like you don't, like you don't (oh)
Like you don't, like you don't (oh)
Baby, act like you don't (ooooh)
When you want to have a late night drive by...
Drunk dial my phone around midnight
Yeah!

When you want to have a late night drive by
