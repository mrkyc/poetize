Cruisin' around
Didn't see the four way stop
I swerved and hit a curb
Heard my right rear tire go pop
When like a scene from a movie screen
He was there in an old ball cap
White night in torn blue jeans
On his knees fixin' my flat
Always dreamed about a man like that
A down home stand up kinda guy
A man like that
John Wayne John Deere and apple pie
Head full of smarts and a big ol' heart
Strong enough to love me back
Always dreamed about a man
A man like that
He was real polite
He said "Friday night
I know a place with a real good band"
When he picked me up in his pick up truck
He asked me if I knew how to dance
I said "a two step or two how 'bout you"
He said "ma'am I ain't half bad"
Spun me round the floor til a quarter to four
 in a cowboy hat
