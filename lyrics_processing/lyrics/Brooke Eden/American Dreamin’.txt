Now they're sayin' there's a hole in my apple pie sky
But I just keep lookin' up
They say we're slippin' down that slippery slope
Hard to hold onto faith when you're losin' hope
But I ain't givin' in to givin' up
So yo, here we go, American Dreamin'
Free fallin', free wheelin'
Ya judges and ya haters can't stop this feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody lovin', somebody leavin'
But it's the same blood we're all bleeding
We all still lookin' for somethin' to believe in
Y'all, it's called American Dreamin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girls gotta be hot, guys gotta be strong
But ain't we all just trying to belong
And I'm just trying to be me
Oh show your true colors, let 'em shine through
Cause love is still love no matter who's lovin' who
And I'm gonna find someone who loves me for me
So yo, here we go, American Dreamin'
Free fallin', free wheelin'
Ya judges and ya haters can't stop this feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody lovin', somebody leavin'
But it's the same blood we're all bleeding
We all still lookin' for somethin' to believe in
Y'all, it's called American Dreamin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
