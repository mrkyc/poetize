Hello sunshine, good to see you again
Had to walk out to let you back in
Stuck in a storm of a relationship
Lost my fire

Oh, and I forgot about me for way too long
But it's rolled on

Now there ain't no shade 'round here
Once you leave the clouds you're under
Ain't it funny how there ain't no rain? All clear
Why'd it take so long to leave you in the rearview mirror?
Now nobody's gonna steal my sunshine
Or turn my blue sky gray
All I know is at the end of the day
Wildflowers grow when there ain't no shade

Instead of catching these rays, I was catching your lies
Should've listened to my friends, should've known they were right
Now I'm looking at a love in a whole new light
'Cause I broke free, it's good to be
You might also like
So far gone, so past it
They're forcastin'

There ain't no shade 'round here
Once you leave the clouds you're under
Ain't it funny how there ain't no rain? All clear
Why'd it take so long to leave you in the rearview mirror?
Now nobody's gonna steal my sunshine
Or turn my blue sky gray
All I know is at the end of the day
Wildflowers grow when there ain't no shade (Oh)
No shade, no shade, no shade

Now there ain't no shade 'round here
Once you leave the clouds you're under
Ain't it funny how there ain't no rain? All clear
Why'd it take so long to leave you in the rearview mirror?
Now nobody's gonna steal my sunshine (No, nobody)
Or turn my blue sky gray (Or turn my blue sky gray)
All I know is at the end of the day
Wildflowers grow when there ain't no shade
No shade, no shade, no
