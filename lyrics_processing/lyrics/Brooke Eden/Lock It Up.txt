Don't it feel nice when I drive ya crazy
Say all the things that turn you on and love ya
All night long
You got it real good don't ya, don't ya
Don't it feel good when I tell ya I want ya
I do everything I can to make you feel like a man
I'll be your friend
Your lover
Your angel undercover
Boy it's time you understand
You gotta lock it up, lock it up
The key is in your hand
You gotta lock it up, lock it up
Get it while you can
If you don't make your move
I'm gonna make mine
If I'm not your forever then stop wasting my time
Chain my heart or free my soul
Lock it up or let me go
You got the real thing darling, darling
It's a feel thing when I'm still fallin'
But boy I need to hear you say the words that
Make me stay
That I'm your one
Your only
You'll never leave me lonely
Baby don't you make me wait
