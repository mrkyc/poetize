But she might as well be seventeen
She thinks every girl oughta look like the ones
On the TV and magazines
She says "Mamma, when i grow up
How can I look like them?"
Mamma says "Baby, it's easy enough
Just remember..."
The beautiful eyes
Look for the good in someone every day
The beautiful smile
Don't miss your chance to give one away
The beautiful lips say something sweet
And beautiful hands help those in need
That's what it's really all about
That's what makes you pretty
That's what makes you pretty
That's what makes you pretty
Inside and out
Mamma's prayin' that the words she just said
She'll sooner or later say again
It's easy to see that growing up now
Is harder than it's ever been
You might also likeSo much pressure today to be perfect
When is it gonna stop?
It seems that we're all caught up in a circus
And the world's forgotten...
The beautiful eyes
Look for the good in someone every day
The beautiful smile
Don't miss your chance to give one away
The beautiful lips say something sweet
And beautiful hands help those in need
That's what it's really all about
That's what makes you pretty
That's what makes you pretty
That's what makes you pretty
Inside and out
As long as you are real
And come from the heart
Someone will see you
Just the way you are
The beautiful eyes
Look for the good in someone every day
The beautiful smile
That lights up the room in your own special way
The beautiful lips say something sweet
And beautiful hands help those in need
That's what it's really all about
Ye that's what makes you pretty
That's what makes you pretty
That's what makes you pretty
Inside and out
(what makes you pretty)
