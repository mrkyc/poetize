Rake at the moon where the river flows
Cut from the cloth of the winter's cold
Bound by the voice that no one hears
I've been around in a way for years
Stray from the heart the more that you know
All gussied up with no place to go
Tableside with one of your dreams
Get what you want and not what you need

Parlor games and 6 o'clock news
Hands of a stranger touching you
Wide awake encased in a dream
Everything is not as it seems
All your time is heaven sent
Days and nights all start to blend
It's not like this town to set you free
The more you look, the less you see

The table's set, the rose is out
You know what this is
Miles away from places you have been
The call was made to pull the shades
The start of something new
Still nothing makes me feel the way
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do

The ones they say have come here before
All gather 'round the corridor
I can't seem to place your name
Know the face that I can't explain
In my mind, you're everything
Lips don't move, but voices still ring
The light inside has lost its glow
The more you see, the less you know

The table's set, the rose is out
You know what this is
Miles away from places you have been
The call was made to pull the shades
The start of something new
Still nothing makes me feel the way
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do

The seasons change
My mind erased
The stars all fade
But one remains the same
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
Must I, your grace
Unveil the face
Only to say
Nothing takes the place?
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
