An' I's feeling nearly as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
I headed all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues, Lord
Windshield wipers slapping time, I was holding Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song the driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Ah, nothing, honey if it ain't free, Lord
Feeling good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
I pulled up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
Well, I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Ah, nothing, well that's all that Bobby left me, Lord
Feeling good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
