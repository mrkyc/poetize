Words & Music by Allison Crowe
So you're weary now
From the company you keep
Lay down your head
And go back to sleep
Back to sleep
Just wait till the end
It will be worth it I swear
So hold on, my friend
We're almost there
Chorus:
Step back for a moment
And watch what's going on around you
You're so concerned with pleasing everyone
What about you?
I woke up at half past 12
Half in and out of dreaming
I could barely hear
But I think that I was screaming
You might also likeI tried to call out to you
Be careful, they're right behind you
But you turned to me and said, I'm dying
And it's too late for anyone to save me
Chorus:
Step back for a moment
And watch what's going on around you
You're so concerned with pleasing everyone
What about you?
Repeat
So you're weary now
From the company you keep
Lay down your head
And go back to sleep...
How long do I have to wait here?
You leave me standing in the cold
How long will it take you to remember
While you're still alive and growing old
I'm the only one who cares about you
So roll me over
Shut me out
If that's what you feel possessed to do
Whatever helps to get you through the night
Yeah it may kill me
But I'll still love you
How long do I have to wait here
You leave me standing in the cold
How long will it take you to remember
While you're still alive and growing old
I'm the only one who cares about you
I am
I am the only one
I am
I am...
How long do I have to wait here
You leave me standing in the cold
How long will it take you to remember
While you're still alive and growing old
I'm the only one, I am the only one
I am
You leave me standing in the cold
How long will it take for you to realize
