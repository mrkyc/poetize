Of all that I can pass down, it won't be just my name
I've tried so hard to imagine our place
The tears streaming down from my face
My father meant nothing to me
But I hope I mean something to you
Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight
Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight
How am I supposed to move on when I'm so afraid?
Of the loneliness that I feel when the sun sets on your grave
I guess the best thing I can do with my time is love every minute of life
When the fact is I would rather curl up and die
I can't breathe if you're not alive
Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight
Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight
Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight
Grab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight
How do I forget you?
If there is light, I hope it finds you
How can I forget you?
How can I forget you?
If there is light, I hope it finds you
If there is light, I hope it finds you
