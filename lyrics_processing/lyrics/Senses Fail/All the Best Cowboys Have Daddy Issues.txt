My father's sins are out tonight, my father's sins are out tonight
I haven't seen him in years, I haven't seen him in years
My mother's sins are out tonight, my mother's sins are out tonight
I haven't loved her in years, I haven't loved her...

Let's hear a toast (here's a toast) for loneliness (for loneliness)
Sometimes it just (sometimes it just) makes so much sense
For every night (every night) I drink alone (I drink alone)
I'm happier (I'm happier) than I could have ever known

My family's sins are out tonight, my family's sins are out tonight
My skin is on the run, my skin is on the run
My private sins are out tonight, my private sins are out tonight
My skin is on the run, my skin is on the run

I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting

Let's hear a toast (here's a toast) for loneliness (for loneliness)
Sometimes it just (sometimes it just) makes so much sense
For every night (every night) I drink alone (I drink alone)
I'm happier (I'm happier) than I could have ever known

I'm betting dreams upon my paper wings
Because flying isn't just for kings
I take the stairs to the very top floor
I paid the super to leave open the door
A perfect sunset is sinking in the sky
I know my body is ready to fly
I start the countdown backwards from "ten"
When I reach "one," my family name will end...

Falling down, as windows pass, I start to cry
And curse the day my parents laid
In a bed of hopelessness
Where love was made, please, mark my grave "Unknown..."

Let's hear a toast (here's a toast) for loneliness (for loneliness)
Sometimes it just (sometimes it just) makes so much sense
For every night (every night) I drink alone (I drink alone)
I'm happier (I'm happier) than I could have ever known
Here, I lie!
Here, I lie!
