But now I embrace the loneliness of ancient Gods
Lord knows I know what it's like to lack a purpose
I've waited everyday hoping for my moment
Everyone I love is always far away from me
(Can't you see)
Everyone I love is always far away from me
I fell into your arms and I fell into your bright eyes
Everyone is telling me that I'm never gonna make it out of here alive
God damn the oceans that split between our lives
Everyone is telling me that I'd better run away if I want to survive
I used to be afraid to walk alone out in the dark
Now I embrace the emptiness that's in my heart
Heaven knows I'm waiting for death to come and take me
I'd rather be with you than alone with those that made me
Everyone I love is always far away from me
(Can't you see)
Everyone I love is always far away from me
I fell into your arms and I fell into your bright eyes
Everyone is telling me that I'm never gonna make it out of here alive
God damn the oceans that split between our lives
Everyone is telling me that I'd better run away if I want to survive

You're the only thing I have left
Everyone in my life has faded
Please tell me this isn't dead
Everyone in my life has left me
Everyday is another test to see
If I can take this stress without it driving me to drink
(Because I'd rather find another way)
I fell into your arms and I fell into your bright eyes
Everyone is telling me that I'm never gonna make it out of here alive
God damn the oceans that split between our lives
Everyone is telling me that I'd better run away if I want to survive
I fell into your arms and I fell into your bright eyes
