And do you ever ask yourself
If the person that you are
Is the person you were meant to be
Or are you too afraid to go that far
Courage is to walk
Through the valley of our thoughts
And in the desert that you fear
Sit down with open ears
Because we were made to wander
Between the mountain and the sea
This body is a vessel
To house eternally

So what are you gonna do
When everything you love is taken right away from you?
And what are you gonna do
If the person that you thought you were is not the person you knew
So what are you gonna do
When everything you love is taken right away from you?
And what are you gonna do
If the person that you thought you were is not the person you knew

You got nothing to lose
You got nothing

Do not wait 'til angels sing
Do not wait 'til angels sing
And don't fear the unknown road
What is diamond was once coal

There is a devil in the cold dark streets
He leaves us silent and suffering
And there's a weakness that we cannot see
For we all feel it, and it is deep
And there is nothing that will set us free
Except silence and inner peace
There is a passion that we all must seek
But we lay silent, and we are weak
There is a devil in the cold dark streets

You got nothing to lose
You got nothing

Do not wait 'til angels sing
Do not wait 'til angels sing
And don't fear the unknown road
What is diamond was once coal
You got nothing to lose
You got nothing

Do not wait 'til angels sing
Do not wait 'til angels sing
And don't fear the unknown road
