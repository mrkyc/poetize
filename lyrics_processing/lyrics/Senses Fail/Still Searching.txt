I can't believe it's been a year since I kissed my fears
On their salty lips and said to them, "I love you all!"

I carried the weight of the world on my shoulders
For twenty years, and look at me now!

I've got something to say
About the last twelve months I've lived
I'm not the same kid I was when I was younger
I just thought you should know

I take a pill every day to help me deal with life

And oh my god, I've lost control
I stare at accidents in a sick attempt to feel at all

I carried the weight of the world on my shoulders
For twenty years, and look at me now!

I've got something to say
About the family that I've lost
I hope my mother and my father think
That they raised a healthy boy

And oh my god, I've lost control
I stare at accidents in a sick attempt to feel at all

I'm not the same kid I was when I was younger
I just thought you, I just thought you should know
I'm not the same kid I was when I was younger
I just thought you, I just thought you should know

I carried the weight of the world on my shoulders
For twenty years, and look at me now!
And now, and now
I'm finding a way to forget everything that I know!

I can't believe it's been a year since I kissed my fears
On their salty lips and said to them, "I love you all!"

Don't ask, just follow, repeat, and swallow
Don't ask, just swallow them, down your throat
Don't ask, just swallow, repeat, and follow
Don't ask, just swallow them, down your throat
My best friend is a man with a lab coat and a grin, I hold my
Shaking hand and he gives me medicine, it almost makes me feel
At home, but they slowly steal my soul, I tell him, "I still feel alone"
"Don't worry, someday, I promise you will feel whole..."

And oh my god, I've lost control
Of the only thing in life I had a hold of
And oh my god, I've lost control
Of the only thing in life I had a hold of
And oh my god, I've lost control
