I used to drink myself to sleep at night
And I would pray to Jesus Christ, "Just take me tonight"
I used to want to blow my brains out in a crowded room
I used to want to drown myself in every swimming pool that I would see
I used to blame everyone else but me
Because I was so fucked up
Into the darkest night I'll take you by my side
Into the summer sun we won't just come undone
And all my life, all my life I've waited to kiss your perfect face
Into the darkest night I'll take you by my side
I love the way that you wear those ribbons in your hair
And have I told you that you saved me from the despair that was choking me
I'm so thankful that I get to breathe
I love the way that you don't give a fuck what anyone thinks
And I'm trying so hard to think like that
But I'm the singer in a fucking band and I'm still neurotic as shit
Into the darkest night I'll take you by my side
Into the summer sun we won't just come undone
And all my life, all my life I've waited to kiss your perfect face
Into the darkest night I'll take you by my side

And I am smashed into a million flakes of dust
I won't lie, I won't lie, I won't lie, this could save your life
I'm so afraid that everything that's wrong with me
Will become part of you and you will never see
I won't lie, I won't lie, I won't lie, this could save my life
My love for you will never die
My love for you will never die
My love for you will never die
My love for you will never die
