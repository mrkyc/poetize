I had a dream last night and in my dream I took a knife to you
I slit your throat from ear to ear
The wound was gasping for the air, your scream so clear

But every dream could never come true
Only in my sick mind can I do these things to you

With every passing moment, it just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller and I am six feet beneath the earth
And I will be, oh I will be, just lost

I had a dream last night and in my dream I robbed a country club
A five year old tried to stop me, but I shot him through the head
And now he's dead

But every dream could never come true
Only in my sick mind can I do these things to you

With every passing moment, it just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller and I am six feet beneath the earth
I will be, oh I will be just lost
With every passing moment, it just keeps getting worse
The walls are getting smaller and I am six feet beneath the earth
I will be, oh I will be just lost
