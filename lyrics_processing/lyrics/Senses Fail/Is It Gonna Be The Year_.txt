I didn't go to college, and I don't own a house
I guess that I'm a failure and I fucked up somehow
Now I've just been screaming into a microphone away from home
When everyone I know gave up a long time ago
What else am I supposed to do with my life
All that I've ever known are late night drives
From Salt Like City, to Seattle, to San Fran
I hope I die in the back of a fucking van
I wear my heart on my sleeve
I know not everyone believes in me
And what will I be remembered for
These are questions that I just can't ignore

Is it gonna be the year that kills me
Or is it gonna be the one that saves me
'Cause right now I'm suffocating
I don't know if I will make it
This year feels like hell
I'm pretty sure I'm not doing so well
Is it gonna be the year that kills me
Or is it gonna be the one that sets me free

When I was younger I was a mess I must admit
I said and did a lot of stupid and selfish things
I never thought that it would last this long
And neither did the others that's why they're all gone

And how long is long enough
And when should I throw it in
'Cause I don't wanna be a washed up old man

Is it gonna be the year that kills me
Or is it gonna be the one that saves me
'Cause right now I'm suffocating
I don't know if I will make it
This year feels like hell
I'm pretty sure I'm not doing so well
Is it gonna be the year that kills me
Or is it gonna be the one that sets me free

Is it gonna be the year that kills me
Or is it gonna be the one that saves me
'Cause right now I'm suffocating
I don't know if I will make it
Is it gonna be the year that kills me
Or is it gonna be the one that saves me
'Cause right now I'm suffocating
I don't know if I will make it
This year feels like hell
I'm pretty sure I'm not doing so well
Is it gonna be the year that kills me
