Calling all cars, we've got another victim
'Cause my love has become an affliction
What did you expect from me?
What did you expect from me?

I'm sorry, but I think I failed to mention
That I lied at my very first confession
What did you expect from me?
What did you expect from me?

'Cause this has been building since I have been breathing
And I know how it's going to end

So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word when I swore that I would let you down
And now that I'm gone
Try to forget me, and just move on
So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word, and you hate me for it now
But you knew all along
Try to forget me, and just move on

Oh my dear, what have I gone and done now?
It's curtain call, I'm about to take my last bow
What did you expect from me?
What did you expect from me?

Without giving away the entire ending
I ruined the evening again

So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word when I swore that I would let you down
And now that I'm gone
Try to forget me, and just move on
So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word, and you hate me for it now
But you knew all along
Try to forget me, and just move on

I don't have love left, inside, inside
And I don't have love left, inside, inside
Are you desperate for an answer? I don't have an ounce of good
Left in me now, that's why I walked out
So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word when I swore that I would let you down
And now that I'm gone
Try to forget me, and just move on
So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word, and you hate me for it now
But you knew all along
Try to forget me and just move on

I am not the one that you should blame
So take what I left you for the pain
I am not the one that you should blame
So take what I left you for the pain
