It's never been easy, it's always been a struggle for me
I hope that when I'm gone my love will live in song
Don't try to rescue me when swinging from the attic beam
What a time to be alive, but I'd be fine if it was my last night
God, I pray for the endless motion
To take me out of my misery
The only thing that I need tonight is you right here by my side
And ever since you left me
This pain inside hasn't gone away
And I just don't think it ever will
Your eyes will haunt me until the day I die
I can't keep going on singing a one note song
I cannot give up when I'm the only person that she needs
My sweet Penelope I'm sorry but I had to leave
I'm just not strong enough to be there for the both of us
What a time to be alive, but I'd be fine if it was my last night
God, I pray for the endless motion
To take me out of my misery
The only thing that I need tonight is you right here by my side
And ever since you left me
This pain inside hasn't gone away
And I just don't think it ever will
Your eyes will haunt me until the day I die

And I just don't think it ever will
Your eyes will haunt me until the day I die
I would rather die than be without my love
I'd rather die than be without my love
I would rather die than be without, without my love
