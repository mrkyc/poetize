I hear a wind
Whistling air
Whispering
In my ear

Boy Mercury shootin' through every degree
Oh, girl dancin' down those dirty and dusty trails
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Around the world, the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings, without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Skip the airstrip to the sunset
Yeah, ride the arrow to the target one
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Around the world, the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings, without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel
You might also like

Fly the great big sky, see the great big sea
Kick through continents, bustin' boundaries
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Around the world, the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings, without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Oh boy
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
Ow
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
(Go ahead and roam, go ahead and roam)
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
(Go ahead and roam, go ahead and roam)
(Go ahead and roam, go ahead and roam)
Alright, uh-huh
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
(Go ahead and roam, go ahead and roam)
(Go ahead and roam, go ahead and roam)
Oh boy
Take it hip to hip, rocket through the wilderness
(Go ahead and roam, go ahead and roam)
