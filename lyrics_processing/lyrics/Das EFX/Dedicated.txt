Dedicated dedicated to all the niggas gettin high
Dedicated dedicated to all the bitches actin fly
Dedicated dedicated to all the niggas runnin game
Dedicated dedicated to all the chicks that do the same


Yo
Well if the honeys think I'm stuck up
Then tell 'em shut the fuck up
And you can get'cha man, I bet a grand he gettin broke up
So what up? Who wanna fuck around and get silly?
Really? We're on the road again just like Willie
Nelson, so what the hell son, no bore ya
Annoy ya when I spill the beans like lawyer
I saw ya, tried to pick my style, hit the balls
I guess you must be ready to die like Biggie Smalls

Giggity good heavens, it all started in the projects like the Evans
But fuck the Good Times, we packin weapons
Want the fortune and the fame kid, you know the name kid, style reign
Puttin MC's thru style change
And if you want me then you got to come get me
I'm strictly fuckin niggas up like one-fifty
One, two rum shots chased precise
Two gun shots but it's sheisty, they wanna ice
Thinkin I might be the herb, I'm not him
And I'ma get paid in full like Rakim
You might also likeChorus


Well here I come, word, yo this be my third release
I never let the honeys and the moneys get me geese, peace
To the crews payin dues in the background
How my rap sound? Yo Boogie Banger bring it back now

Niggas with the runnin mile, your time's runnin out
I make it happen, niggas slackin, son they dumbin out
Actin fly, jack passed me by
Mmmah - you can kiss that black ass goodbye

No lie, see I fry your crew til they sizzle
Fizzle, you know the sewer style is invizzle
Bull take a pull, lift your full money pass
Fast, before I put a whoopin on that ass

Then I get the bone, split the L, stuff it well
Niggas bullshittin wonder how the fuck it sell
Now dig it, me and my man we ain't wit it
We snuffin motherfuckers at the weigh-in like Riddick
Admit it, I'm right to rough so tighten up
I'm audi for them niggas actin rowdy, lightin blunts, what?
Chorus
