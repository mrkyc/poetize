Comin thru' wit my crew like this
Aah, I'm wit my crew like this (repeatedly)


Well yo, it's 1995 this the way my crew troop
I be the Krayzie Drayzie come to put'cha on the scoop
Like, to be a rapper nowadays is real handy
That's why all these niggas wanna be down like Brandy
They huffin 'n' puffin but still ain't sayin nuffin
I see dem bluffin, they full of shit like stuffin
Uh, without rehearsal my style is universal
And I been drinkin St.Ives before dem commercials
I puff a L everytime I gotta write a jam
So I can climb the fuckin charts like Spiderman

Yo yo, I be the Books but don't confuse me with Scholastic
Boy, I'll still sink your head like I was St.John the Baptist
Spot-blower especially when I'm not sober
Twisted in the head I'm seein red like October
Yo, the jibber-jabber, ain't a livin rapper deeper
Who get looser than the leaves up in my fucking trapper keeper
Flavor like twice so you better rise up
Read the off-the-wall styles like ya game of flys up
Yo brother, I'm bout to shove another
Blunt, where I chew-talk this New York undercover
And I don't have pity, more raps than rap city
Got styles out the ass so call my raps shitty
Comin thru'

Giggity guess who next up on deck for wreck?
Shit is on and my palms don't sweat
Forty days and nights get in some fights
To get this style piece an order for this water mic slaughter
Dat ass tried to slip a fast one by me
Claimin to represent the murderers like Johnny
Cochrane, but ain't no stoppin when I'm diggity droppin
For the forgotten, the low down dirty rotten
Juvenile delinquents cos I still stink wit ghetto flavour
Distortin my behaviour (Check it out)
Toots, I'm in it for the panties, fuck the Grammys
It's the Books, style underground
Lounge with the crooks on some ol' major look-type shit
And when I come thru I'm wit my crew like this
