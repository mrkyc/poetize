(CT: The question is-)
Intro:
Ah yeah, wontu (get busy nigga), word up
Ha ha (check check)
(Books)
Gimme room to get this mic check
Cos I'm about to wreck it one time for my peeps from the sewer
It's true, my style run thru any slum crew tryin to get the wontu
Checks, cos rippin dialects is what my tongue do
Best sold order, 'Nother slang slaughter
Yo Krazy come and kick it like the , well hear, I wanna!
(Krazy Drayzie)
Well here I be-a with the quickness
Kid I'm wit this, I rip to swing my verses
Just because they think this be like bleeping out my curses
Who's the next jerk to test the expert? You might regret it
I fry ya to a fricassee cos if you see me, baby, be like curtains
I put the hurt ins on that body when I spark it
I'm super like the market when I'm bringin niggas' harkin

Yeah it's my man and me bringin
More horrors than that gripplin Amity-
Ville, still my crew be pullin bitches like Vanity
Six for kicks cos I write songs like I was lyrical
Straight from the bottom of the pit with the residue
If niggas wanna box with rhymes than ring the bellhops
Cos yo I got more lives than ????? ?????
(Dray)
Aiyo well check it
It's my follow up so watch me swallow up these kids for Rippin
Boy I shock em when I rock em cos my crew be on a mission
Boy I swing it yes indeedy, I get more props than Speedy
Gonzalez, make more dollars than these niggas write graffiti
Boy I'm straight up, you're gettin ate up, that's how it go
Bring terror to your era so you better check my flow so
Interlude
(Skoob)
OK, I float just like some helium and stings like tobasco
But nice with mic skills ever since I had an afro
Aw shit, sometimes I get the notion when I'm rippin
To flow or slang, is it just to keep a nigga slippin
Think I ain't when I is or is it when I ain't
From subject to predicate, my rhetoric is spank
It's no competition when I'm flixin with my diction
Oops flexin to the beat y'all, yes yes yes
(Dray)
I cross my heart and hope to spark up blood the size of marker
Some say I look like Books but, toots I be a tad bit darker
Ain't no jokin when I'm rhymin, I'm an EFX so check my structure
I switch again, I'm in this bitch again see how I flucture
Wait, I'm great, ya'll niggas know who sent this
I be knockin out more teeth than your local family dentist
Boy, I'm dynamite, just peep the rhymer right, that gets me over
You better getcha crew because
You're
