Niggas just can't have nothing (repeatedly)

Well yo, they used to say that Dray was a motherfuckin bum
Cos when it came to profit, son I really wasn't gettin none
The wildest motherfucker that you ever saw
They used to call me Petey Wheezthrow, the devil's son-in-law
Got into shit like a fly, I was buggin
From robbin to stealin to dealin, yo, and even muggin
Sellin cocaine in the high school halls
Playin it slick I kept the vials up in some tennis balls
I used to run across the bridge with my peeps
I packed a tre-8, in them days I was playin for keeps
I used to roll around Manhattan all day
Lookin for a prey that we could rob on Broadway
Stickin niggas for their jewels if they're worthy
Made a couple of hits and then we jetted back to Jersey
'86 and '87 was the year
Had the Gucci hat, rock the raccoon fur coat gear
Keep em in the sky and nigga don't ya blink
See every Saturday, we robbed another nigga at the rink
The beast was always showin up at my rest
Asking "Does a certain Drayz live at this address? Yes?"
The spot was hotter than the sun, without a doubt
I had the choice to go to school and get the fuck out!
I hit the South just like a bandit cos I was stranded
Virginia State in '88, you know that's where I landed
I couldn't stand it, shit was feelin strange
I made it outta range but yo, my shit was just about to change

Yo bust a move, peep the flav
Cos I'ma take you back to the days of brown envelope trays
Twenty-something years ago as I proceed to recollect
A newborn shorty headed for the decks of Bushwick
Bless the day, Pops shot the gift off the vodka fifth
Damn, fam got the shift
From the tenth floor down four flights to the sixth
This was around the time smokin reefer was the shit
But now the crib a little bigger
I was the first man in the fam so it's plans for a nigga
Had my clan from my building and my man from 8-11
Wit me when we hit the jams behind 2-57
Mom's babysittin, Pop's on the hustle
54 block was on lock, bust a knuckle
Game grip, some niggas slipped and got greedy
Believe me, another "rest in peace" in graffitti
But I couldn't resist a few fights and petty heists
Cos now I'm 'cross town in the Heights
My nights are a little quieter but still amongst the schemes for the fun
Where sons run guns and blow slums with the dumbs
And motherfuckers don't care
I love the street game so I stashed the green leaf by the air
You couldn't tell me shit either, was more eager than a beaver
Kept it fresh, double-parked in the Caesar
But I got to cease with this behaviour-type flavor
And do Moms a favour, go to school and get this fucking paper
So bust the caper, cos now I'm all in
At Virginia State, now let the bullshit begin

(Dray)
The year was '89 and yo, I'm staying out of fights
I'm running with this nigga named Books from Crown Heights
Gettin tore up from the flow-up, we're drinking til we throw up
We're thinkin we can blow up so to class we wouldn't show up
(Books)
Well nigga so what? Yo fuck the holdup, I'm with whatever
The butter leathers, son I got to get my shit together
Getting drunk, and flunking classes was the function
Smokin blunts in, son we need to stop frontin
(Dray)
We're goin huntin, Virginia didn't have shit for us
That's why we broke out with Dice and Blitz in the blue Taurus
Gettin busy, flippin rhymes on the weekend
The deal we was seekin from styles we was freakin
(Books)
But yo, now it's '91 and me and son we got to scramble
(Dray)
Aiyo it was a rap contest, nuttin we couldn't handle
(Books)
And yo, something got to happen or I'ma get to clappin
Son, we got the blueprints to this new style of rappin
(Dray)
Packin skills from the sewer, I knew we had a shot
Gotta go and blow the spot and show them niggas how we rock, what?
EPMD is judgin it, yeah they cruisin through
Makin all that money on that Business As Usual tip, we flip the tongue and started wildin
They hit us with the digits to the cribs in Long Island
So we packed it in, me and my men we got Swayze
And never lookin back, that's how we thinkin nowadays
