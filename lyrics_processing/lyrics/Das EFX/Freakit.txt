(Well I'mma freakit like that, and I'mma freak it like this)
*repeat x3*

Well I'mma freakit like this and then my nigga Books is next
The crew is from the sewer and the crew is Das EFX
I wrecks cause when I flex I gots to rip it
Excuse me it's the fluid makes me woozy when I sip it
I'm wicked so let me kick it, I got my crew in
I rips just for kicks, I got more chicks than Perdue and
I pick em, pluck em, stuck em with my cock and
No my name ain't Santa but here's somethin for your stockin'
I'm rockin', I gotcha clockin' I'm from the under-
Ground so check my sound because it's bound to make ya wonder
Chorus:
Well I'mma freakit like that, and I'mma freakit like this
Well I'mma freakit like that, and I'mma freakit like this
Well I'mma freakit like that, and I'mma freakit like this
Well I'mma freakit like that, and watch me freakit like this

You might also likeWell I'mma freakit like that with more maneovers than the Heimlich
When I rhyme with the Krayz vertebraes in your spine get
Chills, rippin up the skills, I'm like awesome
And if the mic was Spades, well then my style would run a Boston
So just buckle up and I'll be glad to blast that ass
Out the socket when I rock it like NASA
And plus I'm gettin hysterical wit my lyrical concoctions
I take it to the top then hook up my pops and
I'm dope when I'm swingin more hits than the Oakland A's
I freakit like dat and then I'm swayz
Chorus:
Well I'mma freakit like this, and I'mma freakit like that
*repeat x3*

Well I'mma freakit like this because I be doper than the dopest
I focus on the mic and if you like this you can quote this
I wrote this, I smoke this mic until it's heated
This kid he tried to battle me but then he got defeated
I'm weeded, no bleep that, no keep that, no sell-out
Cause if I ever do you know my crew'll get the hell out
I'm quick with the lingo, my thing go for days
I flip it when I rip it cause I like what it pays
I'm dip dodge dope, y'know I'm gonna getcha
Cause now I rush the mic just like a batter rushed the pitcher
Chorus:
Well I'm freakit like that, and I'mma freakit like this
*repeat x3*

Well I'mma freakit like that cause, Black, I bust caps with rough raps
And plus I does the stuff that, flips scripts and dust chaps
Off with the quickness, I'm wicked with the propaganda
And hot damn, I got more props than that Fox Samantha
The hickory-dick slickest nigga wit thee
Raps that sound nifty, weight around a pound sixty
I'm freakin the rap flurries with a black skullie hat on
I'm screamin on tracks like niggas threw me from the platform
I'm dope, when I'm swingin more hits than the Oakland A's
I freakit like dat and then I'm swayz
Chorus:
Well I'mma freakit like this, and I'mma freakit like that
