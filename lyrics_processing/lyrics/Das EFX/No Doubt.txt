Yo, Im about to pull the plug out
Thug out, but rub out
Head for my car, get blazed, turn the whole club out
Shit I set it for real when I bug out
My trey mark making it possible for paramedics to pull the plug out

Yo, we just seep underground to be dug out
We represent the Ruffhouse
Keep one and a half, even while I'm banned
At the thug house (tha'ts right)
Now you're facing a one of a kind dude
Undefined dude, top of the line dude

Aiyyo, we giggity getting bug in here
All my people up in here

Bullets figgity flying every fucking where
Its un fucking faitiggity tear cats out the frame
Diggity Das, Billy Danz, Teflon, and Lil Fame
Chorus - 2x

Say hello to the bad guy
Hmmhm, excuse me as I
Grab my N-U-Ts no need to ask why
We blow the spot up
Hit em with the uncut raw
Could be somewhat more
Advance with the product
You dealing with sacrifice, real hardcore
All the love for these thugs that Im willing to die for
First family staff Its deep
You catch us on these beats
But we should never be disconnected from these streets

See my higgity hard times
That bring forth these higgity hard rhymes
Hard crimes, leave em hospitalized with scar lines
Figgity far rhymes, my squad shines, Its turn to eat again
Motivated by cats who would never see the street again

See him in the next life cause thats where were gon meet again
And if it goes down then, you gon bleed again
Any ground I roam I stand on it
Keep a llama with eight shots and my hand on it

Yeah, so lets expand on it ( what )
Put my mans on it ( what )
Its the shit that make flies wanna land on it ( what )
The Higgity Hit Squad and Firing Squad
We drillin ya, killin ya, figgity feelin ya til the next millennia
