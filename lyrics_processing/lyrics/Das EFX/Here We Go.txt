Yo it's the slick fuckin-dick trife nigga from the Heights again
I'm gettin nice again exin' pussy's like Mice and Men
So I pretend to be somethin that you ain't
You got me laughin til the fuckin bank and plus, I'll do ya somethin stank
I'm bad to the bone, gnaw to the gristle
Puttin the squeeze on niggas so fuck Mr Whipple
If you nibble on my ear, baby girl it might tickle
I drink Olde E like Fred G drank the Ripple
Word to God, niggas wanna play hard rock for doses
That shit got to go, I cock back, shot the flow POW!
CAUGHT, now hook em to the respirator drip
The shit bag to his hip while he vision in the escalator
Now play the humble in the tunnel with the bright light
At the end of it, word is bond, time to end this shit
Chorus:
Here we go
Here we go yo, time to get dough
That's how it is y'all, that's how it go
*repeat x3*

Guess who's next up to flex, no need to introduce
We're holdin down the spot just like the pimps do on the 40-deuce
So here's the story, kid you bore me, don't ignore me
You're gettin killed in my territory
You think ya clever son but you're never son
Gonna get a chance to fuckin call me like Edison
I think ya better run cos I'm comin at'cha
And what the fuck you gonna do when I catch ya
Ya little bastard ya get the last hit
When I blast it you're gonna end up in a fuckin casket
I kicks the mad shit, I come to show the flow
You're fuckin with a pro but yo I guess by now ya know, so
You might also likeChorus

(Dray)
Well now I got you niggas stumblin, I see you fumblin, kill the mumblin
Cos when I'm on the track I'm never wack when I be rumblin
Like dis, like dat, I'm fatter than the fattest
Niggas wish they had this, they know my style's the fuckin baddest
You got the status but yo you're just a pussy
Buttfuck your girl, I'll make her do the Watusi
You need protection when in my section
With the injection, I'm number one in my fuckin collection
I blast off like a rocket, so don't knock it
Til you try it, I come deep like a riot
Ya can't deny it, I keep it on lock
(Books)
A 40 and a blunt motherfucker and you don't stop
I'm on the scene with the nicotine puffer
I gut ya clean and make ya fuckin spleen rupture
Nice with the ways is the dazed axe nigga
I know a lotta rap figures and pushin-crack niggas
Perhaps wack niggas need to play the back step
I got styles for days but styles ain't even hatch yet
I'm super fly, hate me but never violate me
Used to smoke a pound a week but I be gettin higher lately
Rhymesayers need prayers cos snipers gettin hot
When you make the sign of the cross, X marks the spot
L clips to my lips with my niggas to the side
3-80 stash in the 3-25
Oops I'm at the eighth now, beast think I push
More rock than Mr Slate, I'm fat like Ricki Lake
Chorus
Here we go
Here we giddo, time to get diddo
That's how it is yo, axe how we go
Here we go
Here we go, time to get dough
That's how it is yo, axe how we go
Here we go
Here we go yo, time to get dough
That's how it is yo, that's how we go
Here we giddo, time to get diddo
That's how it is yo, act like we kniddow
