Ohh-kay, ohh-kay; as we go and do it, do it like this
It's like this and you don't stop
Word is bond when we kick
So I'mma get on, and swing it somethin like this
Verse One: Skoob, Dray
You punk niggas jel up, when I swell up, spark the el up
By the way troop -- oops, I feel a new style developing
So save the stutter, I'm not the baby bubba on the level
I crushes the roughest hardrocks to Fruity Pebbles
Well peek-a-boo, hops, you know my crew rocks, who wanna test me?
I'm next G, heavens to Betsy, I sting like Pepsi
Or Coca-Cola, swoll a nigga's eye up
When I fly up, these niggas bitch up, switch up and dry up
I be the jibber-jabber, quick to make a nigga stagger
Like some vodka, knocka, I'll bake that ass like Betty Crocker, boppa
You need to stop it, filling your pockets off that pop shit
Aye, aye, aye, by George, I think I've got it
You might also likeWell yo I'm cuckoo but not for cocoa, some say I'm loco
Fuck around and catch a cap like Mary Buttafuoco
So you know, that I'mma follow you wit the drama
Slice em, dice em, and ice that ass like Jeffrey Dahmer
 Gimme dat microphone

Verse 2: Skoob, Dray
(Lookin at my Gucci it's about that time ...)
Tick tock, can I slide the cock up in your tummy dear?
I'll drop a ounce and then I'll bounce just like a Gummi Bear
Be kickin' it like the rabbit kicked the bucket, dig it?
Ah fuck it! Now what do I have to do to prove I'm rugged?
I wear my hair crazy like them niggas Redd and Grady, punch
Then serve a rapper, like Alice served the Brady Bunch
I makes em freeze up, cause when I ease up, I eat MCs up
I leave em on their backs layin flat with their knees up
Eureka, bust a speaker, freak a verse in-person
No rehearsin I can flip it in reverse and
Change em, rearrange em, scooper dooper
Faze em, daze em and blast that ass with shit for days, and ...
 Gimme dat microphone

Verse 3: Skoob, Dray
(As we go a little something like this ...)
Well blow, me down, great Scott, I'm weiler (wilder) than a Rott
In the winter, man, my 40 Timberlands hit the spot
His pop's name is Alvin, my sister's name is Kitty
My raps bust for oohs like some silicone titties
HIYA! I kicked it, and there it goes man
Abused my style as a child, right now it's phatter than Roseanne
Well check how I'mma wreck it when I'm, droppin, this rhyme
Don't let me have to transform like Op-ti-mus Prime
Cause then I'mma have to flip the script and get jetty
Run laps around your fuckin crew like Mario Andretti
When I expand like spandex, my jam wrecks the Ampex
You better be on the way before I'm doin you and ya man next
 Gimme dat microphone
