Coming straight from the sewer, I biggity-be's the rough slang slinger
Singer, dame look at me swing it like a swinger
I riggity-rock the miggity-microphone, I'm born to rock it
Don't jock it, I'm quiggity-quick-quick, thiggity-thick, yo, drop it
I'm flippin' the flap, so check out the rap skills, ill, ain't it?
I friggity-fry the funk, so give me your tracks so I can train it
Or drain it like Drano, get Macco 'cause I'm a rhymer
I stiggity-stomp the comp like a dino
Siggity-saur figgity-figure four leglock
Hack-pthoo, spit, can I rock?
The finger-lickin tiggity-crispy chicken
Spiggity-spark the biggity-blunt style is what I'm kickin'
So next up, I kiggity-call my nigga with the slang
The iggity-ill paprika, yo, speaker

Hot diggity-damn, yiggity-yes, I'm giggity-grand slammin' like a Homer
Simpson, look at the microphoner on a mission
Mission accomplished, dude, I'm kickin' flavor
With my nigga, oh {shit}! My nigga from Jamaica
Crack a 40, I smiggity-smoke 'nuff blunts that OG
Bringin' funk from crown heights straight to Californi-i-a, b
See me on the freestyle
Chill more props than Benny Hill, um
Well, I'll be God damned, they bringin' me in the master mix
The nappy head, complexion dark, question mark, asterisk
I flip up, bang, knock a baby out your sitter
The figgity-funk, triple packs an uzi in my zip-up
Remember the time I whipped it, smacked it, flipped it
You're figurin' I was a tip, tip, so I kicked it

Coming straight from the sewer, the young flippin'-the-tongue superstarrer
I'm freaking the flow like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm horrifyin', kid, I be wreckin'
Shiggity-shop, when I rock, there's no half-steppin
So give me the mic check, get respect, dude, I'm gnarly
I betcha if I was Ken, then I'd be {fuckin'} Barbie
So shiggity-bop boo, aiyo, Duke, can I give a
Shiggity-shout to my nigga, oh, and the jibber
Jabber Jaw riggity-raw when I'm kickin'
I'm flippin' the tongue so figgity-fee-fi-fo-fum, no slippin'
I'm wicked, wild, bringin' the style when I blabber
I swing it for Das EFX, when I flex, I won't stagger
Or stutter, I wriggity-wreck it quick with my crew
So light, camera, action
Tiggity-take two, um, roll 'em, chiggity-check the flow, um
I'm swingin' it like my nuts be swingin' from my scrotum
Oh Judah, I'm bringin' the power move left, G
From the sewer, test the microphone, 1-2 uh
The nigga, the jibbity-jibber jabber jaw, blippity-blapper rapper
Tiggity-tap a livin in the lap of
The ghetto, leakin' the nigga petrol as I let go
My verbs with an echo from Bismol to Pepto
The um, boogity-woogity-Books can make ya clock turn
I riggity-rocks the spot just like my cock got sperm
I friggity-freaks the ill rap, I'm still strapped, don't test me
I pops shit, pop tarts, and piggity-pop cherries
Correct, g, my style is fat, so I swung it
Want it? The riggity-roughneck Brooklyn nigga brung it

Straight from the sewer, straight from the sewer
Nothing can save ya
Straight from the sewer, straight from the sewer
Nothing can save ya
Straight from the sewer, straight from the sewer
Nothing can save ya
Straight from the sewer, straight from the sewer
