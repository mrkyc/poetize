Well, bust how I'm flippin, flappin, rippin' up the rappin'
Look at the way I kick it, I'm wicked, it happen
One night in Manhattan, chillin', buggin'
Me and some of the crew went around to this club and
Peeped it, scoped it, hoped the tihs was rockin'
Stunts by the bunch, had a hunch they was clockin'
Stepped up, pressed up, then, um, got some feedback
Honey got done then begun talkin' to me, Jack
I kicked slang to her, all my niggas knew her
I wanted to gas ahead and take her back to the sewer
To do her, screw her, I knew I had to hush
When I felt my belly drop on the spot, turned to mush, um
Shush, shush, I needed me a bush
I felt loosey bubblin', trouble in my tush
Then the gush came gushin', rushin', splat
The juice hit my BVDs quick like that
Smack, I biggity-broke my tihs from behind
Tried to shake it, fake it, but yo, I couldn't hide from

Well, do-si-do your partner as I start the intro
'Cause nobody does it better, correctamundo
Back in '86 I was thick with the skills
Playin' ball in the gym with my niggas from the Ville
I was runnin' it like the trooper, had no time to play the small cat
I had it goin' on, word to mother, I was all that, black
So one day, believe it or not, I'm chillin'
I was playin' against these niggas from The Bronx for some chitlins
So bust it, I'm indy with my crew, just gimme the rock, G
I float like a butterfly and kick like karate
I scored 26, I caught a vic and now I'm outty
I'm takin' it to the hoop and then this kid tried to foul me
Boom to the gutter, I hit the floor, I wanted to flip
I couldn't, damn, all of a sudden I had to tihs
So I dipped to the sewer, I couldn't control the tihs because it
Slipped past my hip, drip-drip, like a faucet
Down past my shorts and hit the court and all of a sudden
Girls were gettin' sick, all my niggas they was buggin'
I made it to the bowl leavin' behind a trail of dookie
My drawers are soakin' wet and I'll never forget the day I met
