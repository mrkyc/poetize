Higgity-hey, 'hon, check out the way I friggity-freak the track, um
I diggity-do-ray-me-fah, so- so look at me go like that
I'm with the Books, iggity-oops, I get more pop rocks for jingle
I giggity-gots the rhymes like Ronald Reagan got the wrinkles
Check the real wild, my ill style gets Crocodile like Dundee
I fliggity-flap the skits, so save the {shit} for Peggy Bundy
Yes, it's I, the yippity-zippity bad boy with papers
I higgity-huff and puff, 'cause I'm rough like sandpaper
So pucker up and whistle, I blast just like a pistol
I flip like a flapjack and kick like jiujitsu
I sling raps for hand claps and toe taps, I'm down
Silly creep, I leap a rapper with a single bound
Yes, I rips up the West, I'm the best, I'm no joke, 'hon
I won the {shit} quick and freak the backstroke
So Books, freak it, provide the funk alligator
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back like Schwarzenegger
You might also like
Wiggity-wait a minute!
Giggity-guess who, well it's, um, me
The bumble-B, boogity-woogity book the loopy
Double O-K-iggity S, I'm slick
I giggity-gots more stiggity-styles than Moby got Dick
Aw {shit}, I'm swingin' in from the East Coast, jerk
I don't surf, but got more props than Pop Smurf (Who?)
Me! Yep, look at the way I'm slingin' it to ya, poppy
I riggity-rock the crowd at the Grand Ole Opry
But when speakin' upon myself, I stays private like Benjamin
Honey, I'll knock the boots
And if you're tough I'll knock the Timberland's!
(Ooooooh...) I miggity-major Rolex and tick-tock
I'm rollin' my tongue with the quickness
Now I'm back like Alfred Hitchcock
Or Sade, I'm swingin' in like a San Diego Padre
Brooklyn's in the house, so mother{fuck} Rico Suave!
I don't mean to diss ya, but excuse me, mister
I'm sinkin your battleship, just ask Professor or the Skipper

Yo, I'm back, man, heavens to Betsy, time to get loose
I take a bite out of crime, wash it down with some juice
I'm not the new kids, but I'm knockin blocks off, sonny
Yep, I rock like the Stones plus I'm rollin' in the money, so
Yiggity-yikes I'm hype, I know you digs me like a shovel
I kick raps for sport, plus I'm short like Barney Rubble
Check the slang, boogity-bang, um, I goes berserk
When I flex like Popeye I fight like Cap Kirk
So bozo, I'm knockin 'em out the box by the pair-em
High strung, my tongue got moves like Fred Astaire
Tallywhacker, I'm dapper, the rootin' tootin' rapper
I diggity-drops the funk so you can call me yippity-yapper
The slippery slick sister, stiggity-start the grammar
I'm comin like the Red Coats to toast an MC Hammer
So jumpin Jehosophat, yesiree
The Books in reverse kicks a verse
Like a BBD, I whips it, I smacks it, I flips it
With slick {shit}, when {shit} hits the fan, man, I slaps lips like lipstick
I'm harder than a hard-on, never tender like vittles
I bust fronts for kicks, eat a Twix and some Skittles
Then I'll giggle, hehehe...he...ha!
Higgity-hallelujah, toots, a dab a day'll do ya
I'm the baddest, got more fans than Randy Travis, makes a cowboy
Hop, skip, flip back to Dallas
He's the Don, have you seen my grey poupon?
Bust this, we roll more spliffs than Cheech and Chong
We can do this, I ciggity-can't lose like Parker Lewis
Get the picture? I'd rock a bar mitzvah if I was Jewish
Goddamn, I'm sittin on the bay by the dock
Smokin', strokin' on my big fat cocker spaniel
Breaker 1-9, what's ya handle?
'Cause now I got the siggity-sock soup like Campbell's
