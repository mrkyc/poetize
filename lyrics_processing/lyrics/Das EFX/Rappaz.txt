I gotta suprise-uh, I is a bit wiser, oh yes I gets biz, G
I mention to sling the slang wit me
And my man just like it's a frisbee
Ya flimsy, my thinga-majig is the illest, I flow like Phyllis
Hyman, when I'm rhymin I'm makin the papes like Simon
Says to, my second semester, I still be the best, though
I figgity fucked up Sanford and his son, now time for Esther
So hi-ho, I'm silver, I'm makin the papes when I kicks
The shit that'll make your mutt wanna
Lose his fleas, lice and his ticks
For the chicks, I be on my good foot, you'll get that ass kicked
So yibbidy yabber doozy, fuck that floozy Suzy Chapstick
So here boy, here boy, come get some, it's Krazy
I'm swingin my dukes of hazard just like Bo, Luke, or Daisy
I'm Swayze

Verse 2: Skoob
I hears ya snorin, you niggas is sleepin, nighty nighty
Lord almighty, I'm bringin it live G, see I be
Rippin and flippin the tongue but some
Niggas don't seems to digs me
So I switch, B, like Billy Bixby, cause I'm the shit, G
Yoo hoo, dig see, they're tremblin in their Timberlands
I gremlin switch styles yo, oh I flow like adrenaline
Yikes man, the nigga is nice man, some thinkin I lost it
But I be icing crews with the flakes til they're frosted
So hip hip hooray, pardon me while I do a
New way to school a new J, touche
Holy shamrocks, the man rocks with no beef or ham hocks
Oh yes, and, send the rest in, peace to my grandpops

Verse 3: Dray
Well um, knock knock, who's that? Guess what? My crew's back
Rippin the hip-hop, Penelope Pitstop
Doin the bitin, the shit I be writin, you're givin me rabies
They oughta be usin my germs for sperm and makin babies
Hey ladies, I know my A-B's, I'm makin CDs
I heard you was eatin your spinach kid
You'd better be eatin your Wheaties
Comprendo, so let your friends know, I'm losin my noodle
Cos when it be time to doodle, I lose my scruples, ask my pupils
I'm the slippery slang slipper, quick to rip a QB
Shooby dooby dooby, I do that too G
So you be Kool & The Gang and I puts my slang in
Hangin loosely, oh yes G, niggas be tryin to test me

Verse 4: Skoob
Hear ye, don't look any further G, see here he is
Still mic checkin shit, still Dead Serious
Hello there, I didn't go nowhere, what up with the static G?
I be damagin niggas' fronts like them creeps that's in your cavity
For real though, jumpin jalopies, ha, I'm rougher than hockey, ha
I drop these off-beat, cause my style is knock-kneed
So me-a my-a, I's flyer than the witch's sweeper
Jeepers, keep ya jump jumpin to it, like Aretha
I boogie bang bang the thang like a cramp style slant
Niggas tryin to hang but they can't
Gee willikins, I'm gettin ill again with the skill again
It don't mean a thang if I ain't got my Philly, friend
