Stressin 'bout the things that you wanna do
Talking like we could have been should have been
Here there everywhere
You gotta realise I'm not the kind of girl
Who wanna be alone in this crazy world
But I'm not a'looking for the kind of man
Who doesn't understand
All I need is somebody
Someone who can come and dance at my party
All I really want is someone who's got it
Cause I'm not looking for the one
All I need is somebody
Someone who'll be getting down at my party
All I really want is someone who's got it
Cause I'm not looking for the one
I'm not lookin' for the one
If you think I'm gonna get serious
I'm talking 'bout a ring for the two of us
Better give it up don't be ridiculous
Cause you've missed the bus
You gotta realise I'm not the kind of guy
Giving you my promises to qualify
Baby even though you got it going on
Don't mean that you're the one
You might also likeWe got it going on
Not looking for the one
We got it going on
Not looking for the one
We got it going on
Not looking for the one
Cause I'm not lookin' for the one
We got it going on
Not lookin' for the one
All I need is somebody
Someone who can come and dance at my party
All I really want is someone who's got it
Cause I'm not looking for the one
All I need is somebody
Someone who'll be getting down at my party
All I really want is someone who's got it
Cause I'm not looking for the one
All I need is somebody
Someone who can come and dance at my party
All I really want is someone who's got it
Cause I'm not looking for the one
All I need is somebody
Someone who'll be getting down at my party
All I really want is someone who's got it
