You breathe the air I breathe oh
Cause now you've made my heart come alive
And I hope that I'm gonna find
That our love is colour blind
They say what's the world coming to
Tell me what chance is there for me and you
It's not enough to believe that love is blind
You say our future's gonna be so bright
Tell me that everything will be alright
I need to believe you'll open up your mind
You and I can be together
But we both know that love can't live a lie
Where ever you may be oh
You breathe the air I breathe oh
But if the world you see is black and white
Then I might just blow your mind
Yeah life can be so cold baby
Look deep inside your soul get ready
Cause now you've made my heart come alive
And I hope that I'm gonna find
That our love is colourblind
You might also likeNow that you and I have come this far
Can we be the people that we think we are
I need to feel in my heart we'll stand the test of time
Worlds apart can come together
But look out baby cause worlds might still collide
Where ever you may be oh
You breathe the air I breathe oh
But if the world you see is black and white
Then I might just blow your mind
Yeah life can be so cold baby
Look deep inside your soul get ready
Cause now you've made my heart come alive
And I hope that I'm gonna find
That our love is colourblind
Takes every kind of people
To make this world go round
But am I chasing rainbows
With the love we found
Please don't let me down
Where ever you may be oh
You breathe the air I breathe oh
But if the world you see is black and white
Then I might just blow your mind
Yeah life can be so cold baby
Look deep inside your soul get ready
Cause now you've made my heart come alive
And I hope that I'm gonna find
That our love is colourblind
That your love is colour blind
