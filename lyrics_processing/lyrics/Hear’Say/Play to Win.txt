Lord knows I've been hurt before
Just about to give up
When I think I can take no more
And my battle is lost
Doesn't mean I can't win the war
Game still going on
No way to predict the score
If I turn around, give you up and walk away
I will never know what we could have been
If the love we found is strong enough to make me stay
Would you take a chance would you still believe
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
This is how it goes, all we gotta do is begin
Sometimes you're out, sometimes you're in
This is how is goes, now we're gonna play to win
Play to win, play to win
It was dark and cold, and I thought it would never change
Like a brick in the wall, when I thought it was all in vain
You came into my life, you helped me to ease the pain
In a different light, like sunshine after rain
If I turn around, give you up and walk away
I will never know what we could have been
If the love we found is strong enough to make me stay
Would you take a chance would you still believe

This is how it goes, all we gotta do is begin
Sometimes you're out, sometimes you're in
This is how it goes, now we're gonna play to win
Play to win, play to win
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
This is how it goes, all we gotta do is begin
Sometimes you're out, sometimes you're in
This is how it goes, now we're gonna play to win
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
This is how it goes, all we gotta do is begin
Sometimes you're out, sometimes you're in
This is how it goes, now we're gonna play to win
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
This is how it goes, all we gotta do is begin
Sometimes you're out, sometimes you're in
This is how it goes, now we're gonna play to win
