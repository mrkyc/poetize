Whatever you do
It's pure and simple
I'll be there for you
You've been saying that I'm driving you crazy
And I haven't been around for you lately
But I've had a few things on my mind
When I'm with ya I am filled with emotion
Can't you see that I'm giving you devotion
And a love like this is hard to find
I know I've bin walking around in a daze (baby, baby)
You've gotta believe me when I say (oh oh)
Wherever you go (I'll always be there)
Whatever you do (I know I'm gonna be there)
It's pure and simple (yeh yeh yeh)
I'll be there for you (pure and simple gonna be there)
Whatever it takes (I'll always be there)
I swear it's true (you know I'm gonna be there)
It's pure and simple (yeh yeh yeh)
I'll be there for you (pure and simple gonna be there)
I've been there through the stormiest weather
Always trying to make things a bit better
And I know I've gotta try and get through to you
You can love me in a way like no other
But the situation's taking you under
So you need to tell me now what you wanna go
