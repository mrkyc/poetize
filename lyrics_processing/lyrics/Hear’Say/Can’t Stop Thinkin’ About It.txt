Can't Stop, Can't Stop Now
Can't Stop, Can't Stop Now
That feeling that I can't define
And my heart is beating overtime
Let the rhythm take control
Of your body, mind and soul
If you got it
Come and cross the line
We could cut to the rush
(Tell me what's on your mind)
So now Baby hush, baby hush
(Got to tell you this)
I can't stop thinking about it
(Can't stop, Can't stop, Now)
So what you gonna do about it?
You gotta let me know
I can't stop thinking about it
(Can't stop, Can't stop, Now)
I just can't wait and see
What you gonna do to me
I can see your eyes all over me
Tell me what is your philosophy
I can read between the lines
And I like the things I find
Something sweet beneath this chemistry
We could cut to the rush
(I know what's on your mind)
So now Baby hush, baby hush
(Got to tell you this)
I can't stop thinking about it
(Can't stop, Can't stop, Now)
So what you gonna do about it?
You gotta let me know
I can't stop thinking about it
(Can't stop, Can't stop, Now)
I just can't wait and see
What you gonna do to me
I just can't wait and see
What you gonna do to me
(I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it)
We could cut to the rush
(I know what's on your mind)
So now Baby hush, baby hush
(I Got to tell you that)
I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
(Can't stop, Can't stop, Now)
So what you gonna do about it?
You gotta let me know
I can't stop thinking about it
(Can't stop, Can't stop, Now)
I just can't wait and see
What you gonna do to me
I can't stop thinking about it
(Can't stop, Can't stop, Now)
So what you gonna do about it?
You gotta let me know (Let Me Know)
I can't stop thinking about it
(Whoa)
I just can't wait and see
What you gonna do to me
I can't stop thinking about it
(Can't stop, Can't stop, Now)
So what you gonna do about it?
You gotta let me know
