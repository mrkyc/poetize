And I haven't been around for you lately
But I've had a few things on my mind;
When I'm with you I am filled with emotion
Can't you see that I'm giving you devotion
And a love like this is hard to find
I know I've been walking around in a daze(baby, baby)
You gotta believe me when I say(ooh, ooh)
Wherever you go(I'm gonna be there)
Whatever you do(You know I'm gonna be there)
Pure and Simple, I'll be there for you
(Pure and Simple gonna be there)
Whatever it takes, I swear it's true
(You know I'm gonna be there)
Pure and Simple, I'll be there for you
(Pure and Simple gonna be there)
I've been there through the stormiest weather
Always trying to make things a little better
And I know I gotta try and get through to you;
You can love me in a way like no other
But the situations taking you under
So you need to tell me now what you wanna do
