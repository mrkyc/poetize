Ooh Ooh
When I'm alone I can not help myself
From falling deeper in love with you
Holding you close and feeling your body
Moments like this make me lose control
I can't help the way I feel right now
And I don't want to let my baby down
I want you to know just how I feel
That the love inside is truly real
'Cause baby, lovin' is easy (Ooh Ooh)
You make me feel so good inside
You're the only one that just feels right
'Cause baby, lovin' is easy (Ooh Ooh)
(With you, oh)
Touching your skin
I want to have you to myself boy, I only want you (want you too yeah)
Everything you say
It means so much to me
You are my life
The love and my one

The way I feel right now (oh yeah)
And I don't want (no I don't want)
To let my baby down (down down down down)
