You know what's funny? I never thought it would happen dog
From smoking reefer and doing drugs in apartment halls
From living depressed, trapped inside of my bedroom walls
Forced to regret, karma had me gripped by my balls
Told you I was born a fucking zero
The cold world filled with pop culture but lacking heroes
Two paths, both of us choosing the one that's evil
The other path really not shiny and gold to people
So I try both
Artists like Van Gogh still repping the gang though
Expanding my cash flow, I have to
Problem is, when the money take all control
You'd rather beside your soul, than keep your mind so enclosed
Then you turn on your TV loving reality shows
Take it literal, vicariously living in their world
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of all entertainment
But you gotta be basic to believe what they be sayin'
The news preach what's they favorite
The music we hear, its tasteless
The good shows come the latest
The primetime's fucking wasted
I'm trying to show you that all the things that we chase
This fake shit, its cool to go obtain it, but keep your innate inner greatness
The world is a planet that's dualistic in nature
The balance keep us debating
Division's the devil's favorite
But if we take the time to see that we are the same
If we combine all the races, then we could become the greatest
You might also like
And that's why, if we come together from changes
And that's why, they gonna keep us all separated
Feed us lies, with they poison, they shit's contagious
And that's why, I be spreading love through the nation

Music be my oasis, but pain over power, patience
Like, "Which side to choose?"
My mind confused, product of figmentations
So easy to hear the whispers of Satan, them demons waitin'
Be easy, put on them brakes, don't be greedy
Turn to the pastor, he fiendin'
Now everything on the late
I move according to feelings
Cause that new order done caught us
Try to destroy our children
I sit and watch this little pot, thinking of 'Pac
For my terror, speaking to God for some clearance
Within these times, uh
Brought up in the trenches
Stepped through the doors of perception
Generation for your destiny if we don't balance the present
Every second, camera pressing
Enjoy the moments you blessed with
Instead of Instagram flexing, we all evolve, so don't sweat it
But honestly let's do better, just take one look in the mirror
We're gaining truth from the eras
You live for you, not your parents
Don't overdo shit, just manage
No good comes without a challenge
So some haters trying to scavenge cabbage
Stay up on your path, you valid
Take advantage of the times ahead
Stay planted right then, expand
Replenish the life within
Remember life don't come twice
So we living like it's the end
I gamble life on both sides
Not truly I understand
But fuck it we all say and pretend
We want to fix shit then
Go pass a lone soul with no crib to live
And ain't got shit to give
Truth is, we all hypocrites
If we gonna handle our biz, gotta change how we exist
And that's why, if we come together through changes
And that's why, they gonna keep us all separated
Feed us lies, with they poison, they shit's contagious
And that's why, I be spreading love through the nation

Dualism, got me trapped up in a prison
Still loving my women, still counting my chicken
See, I ain't that different, a nigga still caught in sinnin'
I'm just on a mission to change the way I've been livin'
The difference, is I'm going to keep negative out my system
I'm gifted, but still a crucial part of me missing
But I'm a believer that if we come to a union
It'll be easy to change all of the things we've been doing
Because we creatures just follow what everybody is choosing
So more people who do it, is sure to make a movement
And if we get into it, then fucker we not gonna lose it
The kids loving the music, I think that's how we gonna do it

Focused on my goals, can't change my modes
So clear the way, no cape
But chose to save the day, I roll the dro and then create
So much older, got my dough up and my dog, he do the same
Just use your brain, gain some knowledge
In your noggin', you a king, uh
Pure sativa strains
Play acoustic when I hang
Super lucid when I dream
Lucy, she my everything
See I'm living freely can't deceive me cause I know my lane
Gotta see things from both ways to get far up in this game, mane
Shout out to the pain
Always sun after the rain
When you wanna look back and see all my hard workin' go to waste
Leave your mark so the young can break
All the limits put on our race
Cause face it, we all spirits here livin' destined for greatness
And that's why, if we come together through changes
And that's why, they gonna keep us all separated
Feed us lies, with they poison, they shit's contagious
