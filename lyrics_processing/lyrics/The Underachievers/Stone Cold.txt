YDNA

Charge up, hit you like Goku, nigga
My clique stay focused, bifocals with us
Keep blue flags on us like O.T. Genesis
Yo bitch stay open, I swan dive in it
I live my lyrics, all facts, no fiction
If the shit get written, then you know I did it
Sip Act' by the ounce when the Tech go missin'
Bought a whole quarter pound when the OG hittin'
My name hold weight, I don't need no weapon
Make one call nigga, bet the beef get deaded
I'll kick game to ya, I don't need no lesson
Been winnin' all year, need to count my blessings
Took a whole year off to relax, I'm chillin'
I'm back, feel the heat like a fire in the kitchen
Get no sleep, nigga, but my passport fillin'
Got the two seat Z, you can't ride with me, nigga
Got the Goose down bubble, I'll be fine in the winter
But it's fly, we fly just to change up the weather
You get high on your supply, you ain't makin' no chicken
You a lie in disguise, got the X-Ray vision
Tell ya nigga stand down 'fore his son go missin'
Like a merry-go-round how the drum be kickin'
Every nigga get a turn when the shit get lifted
Too weak to hold a clip, I let the 730 get it
You might also like
Stone cold killer, one of one, can't mimic
Coupe, no ceilin', got a red bone in it
All about the green like Draymond with it
Pull up with a big K, no K-Mart, nigga
I don't like to talk, let it spray, my nigga
Broad day, my nigga, gotta claim my dinner
I was in the dark, then my brain got bigger
Then the lanes start switchin' and your main start missin'
Drip, drip, drip, I'll finesse and make a flip
Tisk, tisk, tisk, always hatin' like a bitch
I fucked the game up, my nigga, no glitch
We took our struggle and turned it to bliss
I paint her face like she playin' with Kiss
I'll see no change without takin' a risk
Fuck all the fame, I want real happiness
They be icin' they chains, but they still sad as shit
Soul already gold, I don't need no bling
Had to stay up on my toes, black swan with the team
Once you see the king, it's a pawn in their genes
How I rose from the ash, got God in my genes
Gas in the stash when I ride with the green
Had to link my nigga Dash for the loud like a scream
Standin' in the path like he tryna make a screen
How you end up in the past and your life but a dream?
