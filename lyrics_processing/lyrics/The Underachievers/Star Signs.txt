A young teen, depressed and my mind stressed
Had no dreams, at best, was tryna find death
Seemed like the only solution to make my mind rest
Free my soul out of this human body, beyond flesh
Heart beating slower and slower inside of my chest
Ain't even realize inside of me is where the god's kept
Dark tryna swallow a nigga, I give it my best
But I'm running out of my patience, ain't got no time left

So much older, I've been through some pain
Got the world on our shoulders, everyone looking for change
But don't look in the mirror, they out there chasing the fame
This a harmonious error, time to just move as a team
They imprison your soul, stand up and fight for your goals
Always speaking in code, it's only right that we lock
Giving brothers a hope, united visions, a scope
Follow the light to the road, put on them Nikes and go
For the gold

Stop fronting, get up and get something
Sitting in one place, you bound to get nothing
Gotta work for it, it ain't just gon' come in
Pick up the pace, the competition running
I remember days lost inside the pain
I remember days drinking summer rain
I remember thinking I never was gon' change up
'Cause where I'm from, you destined for failure
You might also like
So I had to put in work just to find my place
Going in all the way every motherfucking day
If you ain't making moves then you killing your faith
No way we relate, only stars in my space
God damn, tell 'em

Cop a O and take it to the face
'Til we high as holy spirit, can you feel the fucking grace
Ain't no limits, my lyrics above gimmicks, my music like drugs
When I listen to yours, I don't even get a buzz
I got visions to prove, no time to kick it with you, bruh
Just because a nigga cool don't mean that you can hit the blunt
Fucking chump, used to pay the fool 'til I paid the punks
Used to fail in school, now I teach the young
How to bend the rules, ha'

Drunk sinner, dark moon blocking our minds, shine
Stolen bodies, separation, spirit apartheid
See the vision is the prison of all of our minds
Bring the union through the music, see it through our eyes
Suicide was no crime at one time
'Til I realized my life could change lives
So I redesigned my style and my drive
To reinvent the minds of lives that's like mine
Um, switch lanes, I'm a god, could never get tamed
Get lit and reminisce about my kid days
Ain't shit changed but precipitation in the bank
Himalayas when a nigga take a hit of dank
Better keep cautious, the demons speed walking
Yusuke all I needed, my spirit and then I've spoken
Make sure every nigga gon' perish that shit talking
And quickly clear the premises, no fire drill, we off this

If you came where I'm from
You wouldn't wonder why my escape was inside of drugs
Mother thought a nigga was only gon' end up fucked
But I used my critical thinking, nigga it wasn't luck

Back then lit in my pants, planning the come up
Smoking loud pack back by the staircase every summer
I was fucking with the tree, I was fucking with the fungus
Youngin' in another league, hard ball ain't nothing

So I had to put in work just to find my place
Going in all the way every motherfucking day
If you ain't making moves then you killing your faith
No way we relate, only stars in my space
