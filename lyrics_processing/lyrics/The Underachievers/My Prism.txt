I represent for the elevated clan
Yeah, you know the guys get piff, mad strands
Pop another tab nigga live life grand
I'm an ever living God, nigga fuck a man
Uh, my nigga fuck 'em man
When your soul glow gold like my Egypt fam
My livin soul don't age like I'm Peter Pan
Oh, you're a Jesus Christ fan? I'm the sequel man
See, you've got a piece of God trapped in your soul
It's goes deeper than a motherfucking human though
Christ Conscience shit, living optimal
All the religious bullshit, it's got go
Because these niggas can't read their Bible codes
They preach lies to the masses, fill 'em up with hope
Takin' lunches from you niggas if your pockets broke
Now the preacher in the Church fuckin' lots of hoes
But not my mama though
Cause if I find that out, I'mma cock the hose
And turn the muthafuckin' preacher nigga back to ghost
Now like the Christian religion, he's filled with holes
Nah, but I don't kill though
Tryna see if niggas got sense you know
Fuck the Church and go blow your smoke
The new religion is here, nigga, named Beast Coast
Yeah, we're called Beast Coast
But fuck the US, we turn to the globe
The world inside my hand like a metaphor, poem
Oh, you see the light, it's best I keep going
I came from the great beyond, from out the light I spawned
I ain't a homosapien, I'm from the elevated patriarch

Two red eyes, one glowin' gold
Soul radiate blue Indigo
Purple trees like fairy hoes
Yellow sunlight radiate my soul
My prism, my prism, light shine through when I'm living
Soul different, no wishing, mothafuckas know cause I live it
Orange fire, brown blunts
And the ultraviolet rays beam off the sun
Touch your dead grey soul, fill it up with love
If you open up your heart and unite as one
My prism, my prism, light shine through when I'm living
Soul different, no wishing, mothafuckas know cause I live it

Know how it feel to wake up fucked up?
Pricless, Cali kush stuffed in a dutch
Reunited with the most highest, righteous
Got a pot of gold in my soul, leave 'em blinded
That and the power retrieved from the light
Birdman, Clark Kent, superhero on the mic
I exhale the purp trails
You're girl follows, and never fails, the pimp tales, uh
Timeless like the mind is fella
Closed eyelids, that's the eyes umbrella
Look into yourself cause nobody gon' tell ya
You can't buy joy cause they just don't sell it, sell it
Said it two times for your melon
Use my three eyes just to demise other villains
Pop, pop, pop, third eyes fuckin' shredder
Little lock, give me props, cause I coulda been a felon
But I, stay golden, path I wrote it
Y'all can't hold it, rhyme with the words spit
Conscience, keep time with some Earth wind
Vietnam nigga, drop bombs on your loose lip
Holy ghost, I'm back in the flesh
Resurrected, like I never left, architect Imhotep
Yes I'm blessed, steal your bitch, cause a nigga up next
Use that power up inside ya, divinely create desires, just try it
I bet you'll notice the God within, can't deny it, huh?
We're some young Messiah's, we triumph, nigga, fuck religion
Found a better way of living when the light shines through my prism nigga
Two red eyes, one glowin' gold
Soul radiate blue Indigo
Purple trees like fairy hoes
Yellow sunlight radiate my soul
My prism, my prism, light shine through when I'm living
Soul different, no wishing, mothafuckas know cause I live it
Orange fire, brown blunts
And the ultraviolet rays beam off the sun
Touch your dead grey soul, fill it up with love
If you open up your heart and unite as one
My prism, my prism, light shine through when I'm living
