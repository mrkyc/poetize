(And it echoes, it echoes)
Take the plant and fruit without a thought
(On, and on, and on, and on)
Face the law without a trace of fear
(And it echoes, it echoes)
I can't see the train because I'm the engineer
(On, and on, and on, and on)
Up is down
And down is further down
Follow me into the dark
Until there's no coming back
Up is down
And down is further down
Follow me into the dark
Until there's no coming back
All the clocks stop
From then on it was only night
The snow turns black before my eyes
At the end of the mighty white
From then on it was only night
The sun went black and it was only night
From then on it was only night
The sun went black and it was only night
Only night
Only night
You might also likeFeeling complicit with my shaved head
(And it echoes, it echoes)
Wife's hand in mine without a thought
(On, and on, and on, and on)
All doors are held wide open
(And it echoes, it echoes)
No hand on the small of my back
(On, and on, and on, and on)
Up is down
And down is further down
Follow me into the dark
Until there's no coming back
Up is down
And down is further down
Follow me into the dark
Until there's no coming back
All the clocks stop
From then on it was only night
The snow turns black before my eyes
At the end of the mighty white
From then on it was only night
The sun went black and it was only night
From then on it was only night
The sun went black and it was only night
We're all complicit
In this town
We're all complicit
No one hears a sound
From then on it was only night
The sun went black and it was only night
From then on it was only night
The sun went black and it was only night
From then on it was only night
The sun went black and it was only night
From then on it was only night
