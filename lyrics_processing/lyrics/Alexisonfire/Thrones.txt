Don't need your ancient wisdom
Two things I'll live without!
I don't need a generation of burning on the ledge
Don't need your ancient wisdom
Two things I'll live without!
Relax
(As children rest)
Patience people, there's no need to react so desperately tonight
(You don't need to know the things I know)
In fact
(As children rest)
All of you will be sleeping with honesty intact
(Our innocence intact)
So just give up, tonight
(If I knew then what I know now, I'd stay six years old!)
If you lost everything in a moment, would you notice?
Could you rebuild something so hopeless?
Are you hopeless?
And when you wake alone, with no one left to hold (Woah)
You won't need to know all the things I know (Woah)
Paradise in every swimming pool
Paradise in every playground slide!
Paradise, fist first in the cookie jar!
If I were you, I would defend my innocence! Visually
I would fight all that tried to rob me of that
'Cause there's some things you just don't need to know!

Tragedy in every skinned knee?
Tragedy spilled all over the kitchen floor!

When you awake alone, with no one left to hold, hold
You won't need to know, all the things I know, oh (Woah)
