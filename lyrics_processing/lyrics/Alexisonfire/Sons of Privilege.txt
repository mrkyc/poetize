America blaring in my ears all day
America, I don't see the glory of your ways
The oldest money flows through a bloodline
We'll see if your empire stands the test of time

Don't wanna, I don't wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege
Don't wanna, I don't wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege

Sweet Lady Liberty
You are the lost though you are free
And what hides beneath
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep
Sweet Lady Liberty
You are the lost though you are free
And what hides beneath
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep

America, grin and bear the resentment of the world
With all your ugliness and arrogant self-worth
Desperate to grease the gears of the hideous machine
The swine, they writhe and praise the infallible regime
You might also like
Don't wanna, I don't wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege
Don't wanna, I don't wanna
Be a slave to the sons of privilege

Sweet Lady Liberty
You are the lost though you are free
And what hides beneath
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep
Sweet Lady Liberty
You are the lost though you are free
And what hides beneath
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep

Lost though you are free in America
Lost though you are free in America
Lost though you are free in America
Lost though you are free in America
It's time to justify your pride in America
It's time to justify your pride in America
It's time to justify your pride in America
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
Sweet Lady Liberty
You are the lost though you are free
And what hides beneath
Can't tell the wolves from the sheep
Sweet Lady Liberty
You are the lost though you are free
And what hides beneath
