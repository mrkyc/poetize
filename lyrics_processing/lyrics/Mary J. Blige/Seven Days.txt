Oh, oh-oh

I've been searching for someone
But never looked before my eyes
There you were to my surprise
It was so obvious looking into your face
After playing a game of truth or dare
I wanted to stay at your place

I never thought that I would fall in love with you
But since the day we kissed, I knew it had to be you
I never thought we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do? Oh

Monday, a friend of mine, Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away, Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back, I wanted to kiss you on Saturday
On Sunday, we made love, now what are we gonna do?

As much as I, I want you
I don't wanna wreck a friend I've already found in you
I've been there before, and I can't ignore
How two friends became one, but walked away with none
You might also like
I cannot risk a friend, but the love is so good
I gotta make a choice, I would if I could
I never thought we would be together, how can I address you?
"Hey, lover?" "Hi, friend?" "How ya doin'?" "Where ya been?"
I gotta make a choice

Monday, a friend of mine (A friend of mine), Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away, Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back, I wanted to kiss you on Saturday
On Sunday, we made love (Sunday, we made, made), now what are we gonna do?
Monday, a friend of mine, Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away, Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back, I wanted to kiss you on Saturday (I wanted to kiss)
On Sunday, we made love (Sunday, we made love), now what are we gonna do? (What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?)


Monday
Things weren't the same
Oh, on Monday, we made sweet, sweet love, Tuesday, we played a game
On Sunday, we made love, now what are we gonna do?
Monday, a friend of mine (A friend of mine), Tuesday, we played a game
