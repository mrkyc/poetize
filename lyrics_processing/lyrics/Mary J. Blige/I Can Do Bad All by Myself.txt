Somebody told me once that pain is a game we all gotta play
Then why am I in overtime and sudden death every other day
I know that for the good of life there's a price we all gotta pay
But I'll pay till I'm poor and I still don't know what it is to have a good day, yeah
Since everybody knows what it is that I need to do
Well do me a favor, let me worry bout me and you worry bout you

I don't need no one to put me down
I'm on the ground, can't get no lower
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself

Somebody told me once that running from the rain don't make no sense
I had my own dark cloud for awhile now, it goes where ever I'm going, yeah
They're telling me the grass just might be greener on the other side
But I don't wanna take a chance on dirt when I got grass even though the grass has died
Oh since everybody knows what it is that I need to do
Well do me a favor, let me worry bout me and you worry bout you

Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself

Don't waste time feeling bad for me
I didn't ask you for your sympathy
No I know God is watching over me
So I guess this is where I'm suppose to be
Ohh yes

I don't need no one to put me down
I'm on the ground, can't get no lower
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
