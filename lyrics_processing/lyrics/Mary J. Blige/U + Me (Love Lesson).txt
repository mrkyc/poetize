Must've been crazy to think that you loved me
I saw all the signs but I just couldn't say nothing
I did the time across the line for you
'Cause I can't see myself with nobody else but you
Tell me what you're thinking 'cause this is what you wanted
Should've been the one to hold me when I got lonely
'Cause every time I think of the lies you told to me
Make it easy for me to leave

You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

Oh, I was ridin' wherever you going
At times, I wanted to leave, but didn't wanna be lonely
Can't deny the fact you were my one and only
Love that I would do, only love I knew
And now I gotta turn my back 'cause you didn't realize that, boy
This was a real thing
And I just can't deny the fact we don't belong together
Guess it ain't the real thing

You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson

Gotta keep on pushing and love myself through the hard times
Gotta keep my patience, still a long way to go now
There's so much to learn
When we trust the love that's deep in us
Then love will return (yes, it will)
Boy this thing was, a love lesson

You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
