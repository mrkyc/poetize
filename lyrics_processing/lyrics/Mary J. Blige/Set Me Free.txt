Tell me how you figure that you made me
And you gave me what I had before I meet ya
Ain't gon' have it when you're gone
And how you fix your mouth to say I owe you
When you had another bitch and taking trips and shit
With my money for so long
You must have lost it, nigga, you won't get a dime
But all you're gonna get, too bad, I can't get back my time
Wasted all this time
I'ma be alright, be just fine, woo

There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you, 'cause the truth will see me free, oh

Yes, I cut that bitch 'cause things was running through my brain
And what I found out 'bout you was enough to go insane
All this time to think that you were just here for my name
I was loving you and you were only playing games
Oh, what a damn shame

There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you, 'cause the truth will see me free, oh
You might also like
Oh, I spent so many hopeless nights
Thinking you were really there
Thinking you would come home
Maybe that you care
But I'm wrong again
You never were my friend
All alone
Now I'm finally free to be me, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah, yeah, ooh

There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you 'cause the truth will see me free, oh

Gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya
Gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, oh
If I keep it in, it'll drive me crazy
So thank you, thank you for listening
