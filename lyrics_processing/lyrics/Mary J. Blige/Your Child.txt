It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad, baby
But I gotta face reality
It's too bad, it's too bad
Too bad, baby
But I gotta face reality

Today you had a visitor, or should I say an old friend
But wait a minute, that's not where it ends, no
Is there something that you wanna tell me?
Mmm, 'cause I'm believing what your friends say
About your hidden secrecies

And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious
You might also like
She said she never wanted to hurt me
And could I understand, she's afraid and lost
She said a real woman wouldn't do this over the phone
And that you told her about me after the baby was born

And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
(Really messed me up)
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious
(She said) She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
(There can never be anymore us)
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious (so precious)

Oh, the baby looks just like you
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Your own child
What kind of man are you?
And girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
Oh, and how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours?

She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
Won't deny it's hurting me, yet so precious
She said it's your child, and it really messed me up
How could you deny your own flesh and blood?
Gotta face reality, there can be never be anymore us
(There can never be you and me)
