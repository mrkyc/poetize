Life is a teacher, time is a healer
And I'm a believer like a river wild
Ego's a killer, greed is a monster
But love is stronger, stronger than them all

White flag in hand, I don't wanna fight
No lines in the sand, I'm on your side
Invisible, no colour life
It's time we put our, put our, put our differences aside

Time tells no lies
It keeps changing, and ticking, and moving, then passes by
But if you're lucky, it will be kind
Like a river flowing through time

(Like a river) let it wash you clean
(Mighty river) going up stream
(Like a river) cutting through right
(Mighty river) 'cause it never gives up
(Like a river) so full of life
(Mighty river) liquid like time
(Like a river) let it wash away
(Mighty river) the pain from yesterday
You might also like
Love is the answer, hate is a cancer
Hope of forgiveness, it waters the soul
Our blood is red, we're not so different
'Cause underneath our skin we're identical

White flag in hand, we're not gonna fight
No lines in the sand, I'm on your side
Invisible, no colour life, oh
It's time we put our, oh, put our differences aside
We know wrong from right

Oh, time tells no lies
He keeps changing, and ticking, and moving, then passes by
But if you're lucky, it will be kind
Oh, like a river flowing through time, oh

(Like a river) let it wash you clean
(Mighty river) going up stream
(Like a river) cutting through right
(Mighty river) 'cause it never gives up
(Like a river) so full of life
(Mighty river) liquid like time
(Like a river) let it wash away
(Mighty river) the pain from yesterday
(Like a river) oh, oh, oh
(Mighty river) rain down on me
(Like a river) all it takes is time
(Mighty river) to heal this bloodline
(Like a river) better wash me clean
(Mighty river) get this dirt off of me, yeah
(Like a river) oh, oh, oh
(Mighty river) let it wash the pain
Oh, oh, oh yeah
(Like a river) oh, like a river
(Mighty river) mighty and better river
(Like a river) oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Mighty river) let it wash away
(Like a river) oh, oh, oh
(Mighty river) oh, all the hurt and pain
(Like a river) oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Mighty river) oh mighty river, mighty river
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
