Yeah, let's take 'em back

'91, I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?" things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain, but
I'm so glad to be here and my music's still sincere
Let's get back to the story of all this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl trying to find my way
Then I dropped the Mary album
And people were saying that it's just not gonna work
And my feelings, they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
Then I came with "No More Drama", I remember that week
Yeah, it was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen

You remind me of a real love (You don't have to worry)
Real love
All night long I'm goin' down
Reminisce on the love we have
You are everything, love without a limit
What you gonna do without my life, my life, my life, my life?

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top (Hate it or love it)
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
(I'm gon' shine right now)
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it (I'm gon', I'm gon' shine)
I'm gon' shine (I'm gon', I'm gon' shine)
Go 'head, envy me (Hey, hey), I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Right now I wanna thank
Each and every person out there that's ever done anything for Mary J. Blige
I wanna thank TV, radio, talk shows, friends, family
But most of all I wanna thank my fans
For hanging in there with me during the bad times
And now you're here
To see me at a point in my life where I can actually call myself a queen
And for those of you that don't like it
This is what you can do
You can do this
You can hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it (Hate it)
Hate it or love it (Love it)
Hate it or love it (Hey, yeah)
Hate it or love it
