Ooh, ooh, ooh

Mm-mm, oh

My everything
Everything, everything, everything
You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything

It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You brighten up my day in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend

You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when I have cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

You are my (You are) everything (You're my everything)
Love so good (Love so good, so good) only you can bring (So good, only you can bring)
You are my (You are my) everything (Oh, my)
You are everything and everything is you
You might also like
My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king 'cause you are my everything

You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when I have cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

You are my (You) everything (You're my everything)
Love so good (Love so good, so good) only you can bring (So good, only you can bring)
You are my (You are, oh no) everything (Oh, oh)
You are everything and everything is you (Mm-mm, mm-mm)

You are everything and everything is you (Everything is you)
You are everything (Oh you) and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you (Ayy, hey)
You are everything (Oh, oh) and everything is you

When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything, yeah
You are my (You) everything (Oh-oh, oh)
Love so good (Love so good) only you can bring (Only you can bring, yeah, yeah)
You are my (Oh, you are) everything (Oh, you)
You are everything (You're everything, you're everything) and everything is you

Oh, you take me away (You take me away)
You are my  (And you bring me paradise) everything
And when I was done
Love's so good only you can bring
(When I am done you bring sunshine to my life)
You are my everything (Never occurred to me)
You are everything and everything is you (I would fall so deep, yeah, yeah, mm)
