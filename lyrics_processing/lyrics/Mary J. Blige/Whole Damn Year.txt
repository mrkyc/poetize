Tryna find a way to explain this
Why you can't touch me tonight
I can feel you gettin' impatient
But I really can't let you inside
Bad, how deep the pain is
Ooh, you just couldn't believe
And yeah I seem good on the surface
But I'm a mess, I'm a mess underneath

See, winter took most of my heart
And spring punched me right in the stomach
Summer came lookin' for blood
And by autumn I was left with nothin'

It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years
You might also like
Not tryna do this on purpose
Boy, I really wish I could
Don't act like you never heard this
I know you haven't misunderstood
But the others just wouldn't respect it
Don't tell me you as well
I thought we were headed for Heaven
But you're 'bout to take me back to Hell

See, winter took most of my heart
And spring punched me right in the stomach
Summer came lookin' for blood
And by autumn I was left with nothin'

It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It took a whole damn year
It took a whole damn year to repair my body
It's been a bad five years
Gon' take a long, long year for me to trust somebody
Gon' take a long, long year
Gon' take a long, long year for me to touch somebody
It's been a bad five years
Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
Bad to the liver, bad to the bone
