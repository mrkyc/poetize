Darkchild, Mary

'Cause the sex was good, you had my mind
And I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently, thinkin'
You was comin' home to me
Well, damn, I never heard the keys
Or felt your taps sayin', "Are you asleep?"
Rewind that
'Cause the sex was good, you had my mind
And I, I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently, thinkin'
You was comin' home to me
Well, damn, I never heard the keys
Or felt your taps sayin', "Are you asleep?"

Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me
You might also like
Time I choose my clothes
Choose my friends, be with my family
They been askin' "Girlfriend, where you been?"
We ain't seen you in weeks
Been chasin' this fool around
Thinkin' he gon' hold me down
I would follow his lead
Thinkin' I would be the one he keep around
When I ain't need it, not your finance
And all that I needed, real commitment
I really couldn't see it, not the real man
You said you would be in this relationship
So many men think (These men)
That all a girl needs (They think)
Is to be sold a dream (A dream)
But I won't fall for it

Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You treat me all wrong, tired of you playin' me
I been lookin' at the front door
This ain't yours so let me come in
Don't wanna play house no more
No more, I'm tired of you playin' me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin'
It's time I do something for me

You turned your back, and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me, but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels, Giuseppe's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
Ice me, wife me, you ain't gonna have me

Cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
(To think that you would marry me)
I got to be out my mind to think
I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me, for me, for me
