I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

Sitting here, wondering why you don't love me
The way that I love you
And baby, have no fear 'cause I would never, ever hurt you
And you know my love is real, boy, I can

I can love you (I can, I can love you)
I can love you (Love you, I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

I know sometimes can get rough, but we'll make it
We'll make it through the storm
And I know I will try to make sure that you can trust me
And you know the reason why that I say
You might also like
I can love you (I can love you) a little better than she can (Better)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I know that you (I know that you)
Wish you could be my man (Wish that you could be my man)
'Cause I can love you better than she can

I can love you (Oh, I can love you)
I can love you (Oh, oh, oh, I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I, I can love you)
I can love you (Can love you, I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

If I told you once, I told you twice
QB, throw the booty like a groupie for more ice
Armored truck heist, get the bonus like N'Bushe
In love with you since the days of "Juicy"
Now I watch you play Columbo, Picasso
Tricks inside colossals, turn your castles to brothels, uh
Who you lovin'? Who you wanna be huggin'?
Dippin' on your ninja Honda with Tanisha and Rhonda, what?
You work more body than Jane Fonda (Uh-uh)
Physical fitness, Mary Blige be my witness
Under pressure, I lie for you, die for you
Ruger by the thigh for you, right hand high for you
Because of you, I'm inheritin' trillions
Buryin' billions, Bentley coupes millions (And no one can tell me who)
Playin' good Samaritan in the Sheraton
Crack the Dom P's and Remy's, you better hurry in
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do? (Who gon' love you like I do? Huh? What? Who gon' treat you like I do? Huh? What? No one)
Nobody (Uh-huh, uh, nobody)
Nobody (Mary Blige, Lil' Kim, nobody)
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do? (Uh, the Queen Bees, uh, uh, that's me)
Nobody (That's right, the Mary J, Lil' K, nobody)
Nobody (No)

I can love you (I can)
I can love you (Love you)
I can love you better than she can (Oh, oh, oh)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (Yeah)
I can love you better than she can (Yes, I can)
I can love you (I could)
I can love you (Love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (Who's gonna love you the way that I do?)
I can love you better than she can

Who's gonna make you feel the way I do? (Nobody, no)
Nobody
Nobody
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody
Nobody
I can love you
I can love, love you better than she could ever
I can love you
