Mmm...

Many are called but the chosen are few
The best of the few is you
You know exactly what to do
Baby, your time is so perfect
Why in the hell I deserve it?
Keep on doin' what you do, oh

No one else (No)
No one else (No, no)
Can do me like you do me
No one else, no, no one else (No, no)
Can do me like you do me

Happy one plus happy one is two
Happy two are me and you
Our love was meant to be
Yes, we have our ups and downs
But somehow we came around
And we made each other love so free
