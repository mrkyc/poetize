I left my heart in San Francisco with some club kids
On a crowded street somewhere
The sky was red and he said
"Would you like to come be a part of my North American Dream?"
I could try to chase life down
Down the street and I'd find
The separation of fact and fiction

I'm trynna find a way (Trynna find a way)
I'm trynna find a right (Trynna find a right)
And if I budge I just might
I'm trynna find a way (Trynna find a way)
I'm trynna find a right (Trynna find a right)
And if I budge, I just might

I left my conscience somewhere with my rhythm
I heard about it from the mouth of a man
He was hopping some trains and combing the land
Looking for a lover planted in the east
Tryna run from the dreaded fist beast

And it lies, it lies
In the picket fence call
It was my own paradise with
My own private corridor
You might also like
I'm trynna find a way (Trynna find a way)
I'm trynna find a right (Trynna find a right)
And if I budge I just might
I'm trynna find a way (Trynna find a way)
I'm trynna find a right (Trynna find a right)
And if I budge, I just might

So I'm dancing to a new beat and it came to me in bed
My veins became a strain of light that I let to flow instead
And a wish came to me like Peter Pan at my window and said
"Evolve your destiny child and you'll never walk alone, no
You'll never walk alone," but
Travel to the land of surrender
'Til you can't cry no more
'Til you can't, till you can't
And you'll never walk alone

All this inspiration's passing me by
All I can do is chill when I really wanna fly
And this pollution does nothing but dirty up my mind
Faster than forever in the blink of an eye
To see past my lethargy is hard I feign
The beauty of my youth is gone
But the chemicals remain
I'm trynna find a way (Trynna find a way)
I'm trynna find a right (Trynna find a right)
And if I budge I just might
I'm trynna find a way (Trynna find a way)
I'm trynna find a right (Trynna find a right)
And if I budge I just might
I'm trynna find a way (Trynna find a way)
I'm trynna find a right (Trynna find a right)
And if I budge I just might

I travel to this land of surrender, but I see it's all over me, over and over
Again, and I try and I try and I try, an angel on my left side and a devil
On my right, and they fight and they fight and they fight, they're fighting
They're fighting, they're fighting for my attention
Hello? You have my attention
Do I have your attention? Can I have your attention please?
