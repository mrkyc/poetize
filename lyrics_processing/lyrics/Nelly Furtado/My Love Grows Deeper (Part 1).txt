My love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
My love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
My love grows deeper every day, deep into the sea
But takes a little piece of me, a little piece of me

Oh, it's so beautiful out and I can't see why we're not allowed to be
Up in the sky with the birds, counting the flowers
And oh, my powers have failed me again when I can't see beginning to end
Though I try and test it again through the hours

Wandering stars in the blue could not be born 'cause of you
Wandering stars in the blue could not be born 'cause of you

My love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
My love grows deeper every day and takes a little piece of me
Deeper every day, deep into the sea
A little piece of me, a little piece of me

Oh, why can't I be green as the grass beneath my feet?
As fresh as the dew hits the ground in the morning
And not yellow like bumble bees, please take me off my knees
My knees, I don't wanna be red forever
You might also like
Wandering storms in the blue could not be born 'cause of you
Wandering storms in the blue could not be born 'cause of you

I've been, I've been looking
I've been looking at the moon, but I've been thinking of myself
I've got me under my own skin, I don't need nobody else
I'm looking at the moon, but I'm thinking of myself
I've got me under my own skin, I don't need nobody else

Wandering storms in the blue could not be born 'cause of you
Wandering storms in the blue could not be born 'cause of you

If I could have sunlight in the palm of your hand
I'd take the moonlight instead
If I could have sunlight in the palm of your hand
