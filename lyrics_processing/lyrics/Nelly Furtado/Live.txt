Now that I am lying here with imperfection running through my veins
I take the time to breathe it in, it looks good written on my face
I love just like an animal, I dig in harder as you pull away
I love the feeling of you running through my, running through my veins
I breathe it i-i-i-in

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Getting what I need and never what I want
'Cause I don't need you
But I want you
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Getting what I need and never what I want
'Cause I don't want to
But I want you

A glass of water on a sunny day
The cold air as it hits our faces, I can't face it
In December on the sidewalk as we talk
And I just fall out of myself
I just fall out of myself
I can't help it

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Getting what I need and never what I want
'Cause I don't need you
But I want you
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Getting what I need and never what I want
'Cause I don't want to
But I want you
You might also like
And I feel so alive and I can't get back down on the ground
I feel so alive when I go after what I want
And this fever is growing wild and I'm not gonna settle down
And I want what I want

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Getting what I need and never what I want
'Cause I don't need you
But I want you
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Getting what I need and never what I want
'Cause I don't want to
But I want you
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Getting what I need and never what I want
'Cause I don't need you
But I want you
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna live
Getting what I need and never what I want
'Cause I don't want to
But I want you
