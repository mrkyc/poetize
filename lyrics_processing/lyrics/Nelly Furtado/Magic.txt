Drunk dialed you again last night
Don't know my left foot from my right
Don't even remember what pride feels like
Blaming the system again
Then I go through my list of friends
And then there's me, I'm totally blameless
I've been waiting on the same love
Waiting on the same love again
Waiting for you to say my name
I wanna hear it again, again

Why don't you think of me anymore?
Why don't you dream of me anymore?
Look what life's done to you
You hear lies in everybody's truths
Have you just grown up and had enough?
And you don't believe in magic anymore
Have you just grown up and given up?

I keep on bending all my lines
To fit into a place that feels nice
To do my work and then go home tonight
I put away all my red shoes
So that I wouldn't get the blues
Thinking 'bout the time that I knew how to dance
You might also like
Have you just grown up and had enough?
And you don't believe in magic anymore
Have you just grown up and given up?
And you don't believe in magic anymore
Why don't you think of me anymore?
Why don't you dream of me anymore?
Look what life's done to you
Tomorrow's straight jacket's today's straight suit
Have you just grown up and had enough?
And you don't believe in magic anymore
Have you just grown up and given up?
And you don't believe in magic anymore
Have you just grown up and given up?
And you don't believe in magic anymore

I know you still see me
I know you still believe
I know I'm in your dreams
I know you still believe
I know you still see me
I know you still believe
I know I'm in your dreams
I know you still
Yeah I know
Oh, I know
I know
I know
I know
Oh, I know
Yeah, I know
I know, I know, I know it
I know you still see me
I know I'm in your dreams
I know I'm in your dreams
