Oh, ooh, oh, oh
It's a very popular song

You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
Well, I hate to say, but pop ain't going solo
You liked me 'til you heard my shit on the radio
But now I'm just too mainstream for you, oh no
You liked me 'til you seen me on your TV
Well, if you're so low below, then why you watching?
You say good things come to those who wait
I've been waiting a long time for it

Remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you?
Be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you?
Now that I've flown away, I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well, I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth, I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath, I think it's a lot of yearning
Your face, the colours change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'd expect from me, like that's what I'm about
You might also like
And remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you?
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you?
Now that I've flown away, I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

It's so much easier to stay down there guaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
Than to burn in the spotlight (Open fire)
Turn in the spitfire (Open fire)
Scream without making a sound (Open fire)
Be up here and without looking down (Open fire)
Because we're all afraid of heights (Bang, bang)

And remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you?
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you?
Now that I've flown away, I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And now you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself
