Chuva! Chuvinha! Vem, vem, vem ca, rapaz!
Chuva! Chuvinha! Vem, vem ca, rapaz!

This is not political it's just that I, I
Demand attention when I walk into a room
And it's not that I can't play ball hard, it's just that I don't want to
And the more I think about this pressure love I don't want you
And I can't have you and that's what hurts the most
I cannot show you these things I boast
I'll throw my heart out, keep my head up, I cannot fuck up 'cause

I, I got what you need boy (Baby, I do)
But I will only cause you pain, yeah (I promise that)
I, I got what you need boy (Baby, I do)
But I will only bring on the rain

So I'll prefer to run this road rough around the edges
Good for something, but too good to give it to you
You run your own course at your own pace, but I just got impatient
See, I wanted to explore
Forsake you, forsook you, abate you, dissipate you
So turn fate around, I believed that I was free of you (Not)
I still believe in those days on benches at sunset or the waves in July - or was it March?
We weathered weathers and storms real and imagined, such fragile tenderness
You are truly blessed
I stress this as I blow you this kiss as I blow it in the wind, mwah
You might also like
I, I got what you need boy (Baby, I do)
But I will only cause you pain, yeah (I promise that)
I, I got what you need boy (Baby, I do)
But I will only bring on the rain
(Cut the music)

Chuva! Chuvinha! Vem, vem, vem ca, rapaz!
Gonna make you cry so damn hard you're gonna curse your drawers and wish you weren't a boy
Gonna make you cry so damn hard you're gonna curse your drawers and wish you weren't a boy, yeah
I will make you cry
I will make you cry
(Boohoo)

They say time is made of memories
Well I remembered and I'm tired
This is not political
It's just that I remember the fire
Babe, you left me with my head held high and
I feigned to be more than I was, didn't I
I thought I could do without sugar love
But this chocolate has turned into sweet bubble gum
Candy is sweet but honey is sweeter
It tastes like the real thing but candy is much much cheaper (Cheaper)
I, I got what you need boy (Baby I do)
But I will only cause you pain, yeah (I promise that)
I, I got what you need boy (baby I do)
But I will only bring on the rain
(Rain a'fallin' down, rain a'fallin' down, hahaha)
(Rain a'fallin' down, rain a'fallin' down, hahaha)
(Rain a'fallin' down, rain a'fallin' down, hahaha)
Time crying, you'll be crying, I'm sorry I made you cry
I didn't mean to, let me wipe those tears away
Wipe those tears away, don't cry
