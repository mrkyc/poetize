I've got a flatline, I need a vital sign
I've got a flatline, flatline, flatline

Driving in the worst conditions
Head on with a full collision
Now I'm on the tar in pieces
Body parts are all around
Took off without looking back
You couldn't cut my heart some slack
Try to patch it up with my hands
I call for backup, this is bad
I'm breathing, barely breathing
My pulse is barely beating

I don't feel nothing at all
I don't feel nothing at all
Come on, resuscitate me
Why don't you come and save me?
I don't feel nothing at all
I don't feel nothing at all
Only you can make it right
Come on, you can save my life
You might also like
So wicked with your battle axe
I never really had a chance
And now I'll never be the same
And I gotta recuperate
I'll never be the same

I don't feel nothing at all
I don't feel nothing at all
Come on, resuscitate me
Why don't you come and save me?
I don't feel nothing at all
I don't feel nothing at all
Hold me, you can make it right
Come on, you can save my life

Breathing, barely breathing
My pulse is barely beating
I've got a flatline, give me your vital signs
I've got a flatline, flatline, flatline
I've got a flatline, give me your vital signs
I've got a flatline, flatline, flatline

I don't feel nothing at all
I don't feel nothing at all
Come on, resuscitate me
Why don't you come and save me?
I don't feel nothing at all
I don't feel nothing at all
Hold me, you can make it right
Come on, you can save my life
I got a flatline, I got a flatline
Give me your vital signs
Give me your, give me your
I got a flatline, I got a flatline
Give me your vital signs
