Tonight is the jam, I'll be there 'til dawn
I'm goin' down, I got my big hoops on
Pantlegs so wide, I got my backpack on
I'm gonna hear my favorite song

Eh, eh, eh, what's the scenario?
That boy keeps passin' me by
I said no diggity, no doubt
I thought I told you I was fly
Yeah, he and all of his friends, they
They got that hair like Hi-Five
I don't wanna talk about sex
I wanna express myself tonight
You might also like
I can go fast, I can go slow
I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes

Everybody say hey
They goin' at it all night and day
Everybody say hey
They goin' at it all night and day
I bet you never seen somethin' like that (Like that)
Like that (Like that)
I bet ya never heard somethin' like that (Like that)
Like that (Like that)
I bet you never seen somethin' like that

That boy gonna feel my poison
I know he can't stand the rain
Now you wanna be down with your baby
Back and forth, back and forth (Back, back, back and forth)
They got my rump, rump shakin', I'm another bad creation
All real and I never have to fake it, fake it
You know I gotta move quick and I gotta move slow
'Cause there ain't no end in the road
I can go fast, I can go slow
I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes

Everybody say hey
They goin' at it all night and day
Everybody say hey
They goin' at it all night and day
I bet you never seen somethin' like that (Like that)
Like that (Like that)
I bet ya never heard somethin' like that (Like that)
Like that (Like that)
I bet you never seen somethin' like that (Like that)
Like that (Like that)
I bet ya never heard somethin' like that (Like that)
Like that (Like that)
I bet you never seen somethin' like that

The bigger, the better, the bigger, the better

Oh, I thought this song was over
Hahaha, nope, it ain't over yet

I can go fast
I can go fast
I can go fast
The bigger, the better, the bigger, the better
The bigger, the better, the better, the bigger
I can go fast
The bigger, the better, the bigger, the better
The bigger, the better, the bigger, the better

I can go slow
The bigger, the better, the bigger, the better
