I think I got another one
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League in the buildin', nigga
Oh yeah

All I need in this world of sin
Is me and my girlfriend (Yeah), with the top back
GT bent, pervin' through the hood
Y'all swerve, we perv, it's a difference to it (So fly)
What you done to that? That's candy paint
Mixed with South Florida sunshine, make the hoes gravitate
Uh, that's so sickenin'
Twenty-two inch blades chop down Harrison
Nah, I ain't mean to do her
But your boo keep jockin', so I pulled up to her (What's good?)
Excusez-moi, I'm the young boss
You should leave that broke nigga, girl, you too fine to walk

You can catch me with the top down, blowin' in the wind
Let me know if you wanna get in
Now baby girl, let's ride (Let's ride), let's ride (Let's ride)
Let's ride (Let's ride), let's ride (Let's ride)
I can find you with your top down, blowin' in the wind
Can me and my homegirls get in? (Talk to me, shawty)
Let's ride (Let's ride), let's ride (Let's ride)
Let's ride (Let's ride), let's ride (Let's ride)

You can catch me with my top down, dro in the wind

Bubble eye lens, her and her friend talkin' both ways
I ain't hatin', nah, shawty, gon' do your thing (Let's do that)
You should know how the story ends (What?)
Leave 'em both with a Santa Claus chin (Oh yeah)
I got big dog status
Nigga, we ain't equal 'cause your cheese is average (Haha)
You ain't heard? I ball outrageous
Blue hunnid stacks at the Palms in Vegas (Ballin')
Never slippin', eyes open for the haters
Nina in the passenger side, steel gauges (Young ballers, bitch)

You can catch me with the top down, blowin' in the wind
Let me know if you wanna get in
Now baby girl, let's ride (Let's ride), let's ride (Let's ride)

Be real with yourself, do you blame a nigga?
I ain't a ordinary nigga (Look)
Look around this ain't what ordinary get ya (Young boss)
Uh, the block I came from
The deal got chicks sayin', "He's so handsome"
Welcome to the good life, VVS ice
Guess what I'm doin' tonight?
You probably right
After that, I'ma cop some more ice (Yeah)
Go home, park the bike
Twenty minutes later, probably see me at the light (Young boss)
You can catch me with the top down, blowin' in the wind
Let me know if you wanna get in
Now baby girl, let's ride (Let's ride), let's ride (Let's ride)
