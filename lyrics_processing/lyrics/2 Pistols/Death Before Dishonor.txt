2 Pistols, haha, yeah (Mr. Murder City to you, bitch)
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
BMU (Haha, oh yeah)
Y'all already what this is, nigga (It's too easy)
Death Before Dishonor, motherfucker
I don't wanna hear shit y'all niggas talkin' (Nothin')
Haha, unless it's 'bout some money

To every real nigga in the game, put your hand on your heart
Make a pledge to the streets, you will never ever talk, nigga
Death before dishonor, nigga, death before dishonor, nigga
Death before dishonor, nigga, death before dishonor, nigga
Fuck a jury and the judge, I put that on my life
I'll never take a stand, even if I'm facin' life, nigga
Death before dishonor, nigga, death before dishonor, nigga
Death before dishonor, nigga, death before dishonor, nigga

You see these pussy ass niggas got the game twisted
Tryna justify this thing they call dry snitchin'
Listen, real niggas stay silent
But these Kanye West ass niggas speakin' through the wire
Fire, that boy hot, don't sell him nothin'
He want a ounce now, half a bird later
Them people comin' with them indictment papers
When I was a jittybug, they call 'em now or laters, yeah
All money ain't good, better know that
When I was seven, alphabet boys and they spat
BRRAT is what I got for you cheese eaters
Rat niggas that be fuckin' with them fed people
That nigga got loose vowels at the mouth
Solid niggas know the niggas that I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah, it's Blood Money in this motherfucker
No need to ask your questions, 'cause I ain't sayin' nothin'

To every real nigga in the game, put your hand on your heart
Make a pledge to the streets, you will never ever talk, nigga
Death before dishonor, nigga, death before dishonor, nigga
Death before dishonor, nigga, death before dishonor, nigga
Fuck a jury and the judge, I put that on my life
I'll never take a stand, even if I'm facin' life, nigga
Death before dishonor, nigga, death before dishonor, nigga
Death before dishonor, nigga, death before dishonor, nigga
