Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, hey

I know she got it 'cause she lookin' at me like she want it (Want it)
She drop it low, make me wanna throw some D's on it (Hey)
Whatever it is, you can't stop it, 'cause she get low
When she on that pole, and that lets me know
She got it, she got it (She got it), she got it
She got it, she got it (She got it)
Woo-ooh, she got it, she got it (She got it, psst, lil' mama)
Woah-oh, she got it, shawty (She got it, ayy, ayy)

Excusez-moi, let me talk to you for a second
Lil' mama so fine, she got the whole squad sweatin'
(Damn) "Hmm, how you fit all that in them jeans?"
Was the question that I asked, followed by, "Let me buy you a drink, drink"
Young boss baby, I treat you, treat you to the finer things
Neck bling, wrist bling, weddin' ring, nah, I'm playin'
Might light your neck and your wrist
But you gotta ride nice dick and uh, take trips with the bricks, hah
She got it (She got it), she got it (She got it), that's what Pain sayin' (She got it)
Them other niggas lame, man, lil' mama, I got the game plan
2 Pistols, BMU boss (Yeah, yeah)
I make it happen while they talk, ridin' 6's while they walk (Yeah, yeah, hey)

You know ducked off, girl, you so soft," and it's a blessin' to see her with them clothes off

Got a, cute shape with them nice thighs
And a pretty set of titties, thin waist, with them bright eyes

This my plan, when I get a chance, leave with you if i can
Yeah, I got a old lady, do you got a old man?
Girl, understand we ain't gotta hold hands (Uh-uh)
