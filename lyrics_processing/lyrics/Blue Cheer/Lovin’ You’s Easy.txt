Lovin' you's easy, this time I want more
Cause I can count on arms when I'm sad
When you touch me, I feel higher than before
You never fail to make me feel glad
I always wonder how free I feel to wander
When your life is with mine, like running with the wind
Your lovin' frees mine all the time
Lovin' you's easy, I live in guilty
Smile on tomorrow, today will agree
Something's closer when you're far away
Just won't leave me, your warmth seems to stay
I always wonder how free I feel to wander
When your life is with mine, like running with the wind
Your lovin' frees mine all the time
She always gives me good things
All the good things that she knows
She always sings bad songs, the sad songs that she knows
Lovin' you's easy, no lie
You got your feet on the ground and my head's in the sky
Lovin' you's easy, no lie
You got your feet on the ground and my head's in the sky
Lovin' you's easy, no lie!
