Why are you the only one
That makes me laugh my tattooed frown
Why are you the only one
That brings me up when I feel down
All the things you said to me
All the things that I believe
You're the one who sets me free, yeah
Woman making me sad
Lord, woman she's treating me bad
Why does she treat me so bad
Lord, why does she make me so sad
Why does she treat me so bad when she knows
I'm the one who loves her!?
Why are you the only one
That makes me cry my feathered frown
Why I see your broken wings
Lord, I know you'll never ever fall again
Could it be that you and me
Never sang, never real, oh
What was once will never be, no
Why does she treat me so bad
Why does she make me so sad
Why does she treat me so bad
Lord, why does she make me so sad
Why does she treat me so bad when she knows
I'm the one who loves her!?
You might also likeLady Love please smile on me
Why don't you turn your man away
You, I thought your thought left me
With my love through one more day
When I think I see your smile
Even for a little while
Then I see that all the while....
She needed me to sit and hold her knee
Needed a feather from me
Why do you make sure to see
That the joke is always, always on me, yeah
Why does she treat me so bad when she knows
I'm the one who loves her!?
Leave him a feather from me, Leave him a feather from me
Lord, why does she treat me so bad
I wanna know why does she treat me bad
Oh, why why, does she treat me so bad
Lord, why, why, why, why does she treat me so bad when she knows
