I try so hard to be your lovin' man
I do what you want me, I do
But a man needs a woman, He don't wanna share
So girl what's wrong with you
You been lyin', cheatin', runnin' around
Honey, what you want me to do
This man needs a woman, He don't wanna share
So who's hiding under my bed
She said:
"Honey, you must be mistaken
There's nobody takin' your place"
I said, Lord, Lord, she had the same old story
I had to hear it over again
She said, Lord, no, she had the same old story
I had to hear it over again. Oh
