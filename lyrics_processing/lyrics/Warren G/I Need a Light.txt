I need a light (Light)
So I can smoke away this pain
I need a drink (Drink)
So I can drink away this rain
Maybe a wife (Wife)
Somebody to share my name
I need a song (Ooh)
A brand new song to sing

Long Beach back in the day was all hustlin'
Young niggas in the neighborhood strugglin' (Wassup?)
Prayin' to God we amount to somethin'
By living on the street where they constantly bustin' (Pa-dow)
Big Warren told us that they can't hold us
Niggas ain't shit 'til they pass away, so I
Watched my step, but when Ola Mae left
I was a motherfucking basket case, for real
God bless me
'Cause I be on the east where they wanna arrest me (Freeze)
I break bread, so they wanna suspect me
But look me in my eyes and say they wanna protect me, yeah
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, got me a profile
As a child in the Beach I was wild
Ready to die and that's why
You might also like
I need a light (Light)
So I can smoke away this pain
I need a drink (Drink)
So I can drink away this rain
Maybe a wife (Wife)
Somebody to share my name
I need a song (Ooh)
A brand new song to sing

Could it be it was all so simple? Dropping a slick instrumental
Snoop busting 'bout the shit we went through
Nate singing 'bout the city we came from
And niggas so tight, wasn't nothing we wouldn't do
Time keep slipping, but I ain't tripping, nigga
It's all about my children
So you can save that bullshit
'Cause if I pull my shit, nigga I'ma kill you
The streets is watching
And niggas fell victim from L.A. to Watts and Compton
But life goes on
It's just another song if you ain't the one gone, listen
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
But now I got a brand new G-Child
Big Warren gotta stay Trump tight
'Cause he got to fly and that's why
I need a light (Light)
So I can smoke away this pain
I need a drink (Drink)
So I can drink away this rain
Maybe a wife (Wife)
Somebody to share my name
I need a song (Ooh)
A brand new song to sing (Listen)

Caviar wishes (Wishes), twisting stitches (Stitches)
All out race for the riches
Got a nigga missing what rich is
And what a life mean when you do it for the kids (That's right)
It's for my family y'all
Really the only one who understand me y'all
'Cause it ain't hard to ball
But then who got ya back when it's time to fall?
And it's amazing
To stay up on top, your game so close to the pavement
Time brings change in mind
But then don't let the change bring your mind no time
Clearly, a conspiracy
Niggas right near me and still ain't hearing me (Hello?)
That's how it's always gon' fly
'Til you ready to die and that's why
I need a light (Light)
So I can smoke away this pain
I need a drink (Drink)
So I can drink away this rain
Maybe a wife (Wife)
Somebody to share my name
