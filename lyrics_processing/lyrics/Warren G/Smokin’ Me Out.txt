If you wanna be with me, yeah
Let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G
If you wanna be with me
Well, well, well, let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G

Smokin' me out to the finish, I thought you knew
I thought they knew, who was up in this
Ron Isley, I's be Warren G
Baby said would ya please come roll deep
Chocolate Thai, I said I
Got the Hennessey chaser, skirt you look fly
Peepin' them lips, hittin' two finger sips
On the 710 freeway, I straight dips
Wit a fat one rolled up to puff
I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough
Tokin nothing but the bomb that's without no doubt
As she twist up another spliff she's straight smokin' me out

She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
You might also like
Eyes slinkin' while I'm thinkin just how good it is
To do it how we do it in the hood I live
Passin' homies on the block, gettin' major respect
And by then y'all the Hen dog is takin' effect
Never panic hit Atlantic then I banked to right
Pulled straight Nellin B's order steak and rice
With the gravy, baby gets the shrimps and fries
I'm diggin' on her figure as I glimpse her thighs
She's satisfied, I left the tip and dipped to get back
To twist another zag and to grab a six pack
She went back, so we proceed to parlay
Everything is lovely and we doin it always

She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love

This ain't no love ballad
But see baby I gots to have it
When I see that bomb I grab it, 'cause its a habit
So don't come with that toe down stretch
I ain't stressin' long as baby keep smokin' me out, she learned a lesson
Floatin' high as a kite as I chill and lay low
Bumpin' time is collected, Sunday nights on the radio
Oh, I forgot, how lit I was, crazy glued to the seat
Dog said she need
So conversation ain't needed
When she know that I'm weeded
Headin' to the hotel to regulate it and beat it
I exhaled, I seen a cloud of smoke
I banged it to the boogie by my head and got locced
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
