Yeah, that's right
It's the real one
We gon' crack one open right now
Warren G
We don't let nobody bring us down, motherfuckers
West Coast stand up, yeah, c'mon

We here today then gone tomorrow's
Got me singin' a Marvin Gaye song and make me want to holla
So I hop in my Impala just to cruise, shake my blues off
It's hard to follow, hard to swallow what they sayin' on the news Good lord, it's a crazy world, watchin' cops puttin' cuffs on a five year old girl
Racism, racism got our babies in the system
Mom and daddy's in the prison, that's intentional division
They don't want us all united, keep the family divided
Keep it gangsta, keep it real, that's all I hear, but I don't buy
When it's revolution time, all these fools will keep quiet like "Shhh!" You can, you can hear a pen drop
Can go to one tent cuz I might get popped
People shootin' on the freeway, when will it stop?
But stay strong 'cause the rain don't last
And Bush, the war been over, fix the price of gas

Don't let no one, no one get you down
'Cause if they do, if they do, I'll be around

What's really good? What's really hood? What's really goin' on? Open your eyes and ears, wipin' your eyes from tears
From all the lies and fears, people get blinded here, let me define it clear
You gotta cross the bad, tell us some thoughts and prayers
Someone'll floss the stair, you getting lost in there
Homie the cost ain't fair, sickers get bought in pairs
Seller get caught, so rare, never been taught to care
I heard the shot from me, hid on the spot from 
Out on the street, prepare, levels of heat, you dare spit at my feet
I swear I will retreat for years, people deceive their peers
Make you believe the cheers, but underneath the smears
I keep switchin' gears, part of my sleeve I wear
For all the , gotta dime to spare? You sound so sincere
You write a line, but yeah, you sound so sincere

Don't let no one, no one get you down
'Cause if they do, if they do, I'll be around

Y'know what I am sayin'? It's a lot going on this world
But we gotta keep pushin' and movin', improvin'
Y'know what I am sayin'? Yeah
Even though we got these hard times, we still gotta keep it steady You know? Keep pushin'
So I want y'all to ride with me and cha-cha to this, c'mon Dedicated to my people out there strugglin' (Stay strong)
Single parents, nine-to-five, steady hustlin' (Stay strong)
College students workin' hard to be somethin' (Stay strong) anybody makin' somethin' outta nothin' (Stay strong)
Dedicated to my people on lock-down (Stay strong)
To everybody lost somebody, wish they still around (Stay strong) to all the solders fightin' for us on foreign ground (Stay strong)
To one and all, turn them frowns upside-down
Don't let no one, no one get you down
'Cause if they do, if they do, I'll be around
Don't let no one, no one get you down
'Cause if they do, if they do, I'll be around
Don't let no one, no one get you down
