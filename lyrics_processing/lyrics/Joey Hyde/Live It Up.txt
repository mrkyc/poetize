I just wanna take my time, don't wanna race it
Find a couple friends who wanna waste it
Drinking Miller forties in the basement, basement
We could slide into the deep end of a dive bar
Karaoke, you can sing the hard part
Wake up, not remembering where I parked my car

I just wanna spend my time
Living it up all night
With people I love, this life
Is here and it's gone
We only get one
So I'm gonna throw all my
Worries away 'cause at
The end of the day this life
Is here and it's gone
And we only get one

So live it up

Don't ask for permission, maybe just forgiveness
Marching to the beat of my own business
People talking shit, ain't gonna listen, listen
I'll make money when I need it, gonna spend it
On beer and gasoline, damn right I'll lend it
When I got it but when I don't
I'll be surfing couches and  smokes

I just wanna spend my time
Living it up all night
With people I love, this life
Is here and it's gone
We only get one
So I'm gonna throw all my
Worries away 'cause at
The end of the day this life
Is here and it's gone
And we only get one
So live it up
So live it up

Gonna do what I like
Gonna live up my life
Gonna do what I like
Gonna live up my life

I just wanna spend my time
Living it up all night
With people I love, this life
Is here and it's gone
We only get one
So I'm gonna throw all my
Worries away 'cause at
The end of the day this life
Is here and it's gone
And we only get one

So live it up
