I've seen a glimpse of heaven
With my own eyes right here on earth
More beautiful than words like beautiful describe
Ain't something you can capture
In a three by five
It's clear as day that the day God made it
Yup, he took his time

It don't look like a night in Paris
Or a sunset in Malibu
Or some high price on the west side
With some million dollar view
It don't look like Arizona
Where the mountains meet the moon
No it don't look like that
It don't look like that

It looks like you
Like you're looking at me right now
With your midnight eyes and your hair let down
With your t-shirt on and your rose lips
Saying "Baby come and kiss me"
When you're putting your hands on me
There's nowhere else that I'd rather be
I swear to God the picture perfect view
It looks like you (Like you)
It looks like you yeah (Like you)
You might also like
Yeah how'd I get so lucky?
What did I do right for you to fall in love with me
When you fell right out of the sky
If my crazy prayer gets answered
My wildest dream comes true
Let me tell you what it looks like girl

It looks like you
Like you're looking at me right now
With your midnight eyes and your hair let down
With your t-shirt on and your rose lips
Saying "Baby come and kiss me"
When you're putting your hands on me
There's nowhere else that I'd rather be
I swear to God the picture perfect view
It looks like you yeah

It don't look like a night in Paris
Or a sunset in Malibu
Or some high price on the west side
With some million dollar view
It don't look like Arizona
Where the mountains meet the moon
No it don't look like that
It don't look like that
It looks like you
Like you're looking at me right now
With your midnight eyes and your hair let down
With your t-shirt on and your rose lips
Saying "Baby come and kiss me"
When you're putting your hands on me
There's nowhere else that I'd rather be
I swear to God the picture perfect view
It looks like you (Like you)
It looks like you yeah (Like you)
