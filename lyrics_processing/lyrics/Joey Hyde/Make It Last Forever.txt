Sugar Ray on the speakers, no doors on the Jeep
Drive it out on the beach and watch you roll up your jeans
Getting lost in your eyes in the moonlight
Making out like we know it's our last night
It's our last drop of summer, soak it up like the sun
Feel your skin, pull you closer, girl I'm just hanging on
To this moment, it's more than just right now
Baby take a look around

We got one last star in that Pensacola sky
One last sip of that rum and coke high
We got one last never gonna find nothing better
If it's goodbye make it last forever
One last wave crashing in on that coast
One last dance before I'm letting you go
We got one last kiss right here together
If it's goodbye make it last forever

Make it sweet, make it hurt, make every second count
Light a fire, let it burn like we're never going out
With the tide, don't you cry any more tears
'Cause baby we're still here
You might also like
We got one last star in that Pensacola sky
One last sip of that rum and coke high
We got one last never gonna find nothing better
If it's goodbye make it last forever
One last wave crashing in on that coast
One last dance before I'm letting you go
We got one last kiss right here together
If it's goodbye make it last forever

You're the sound of the ocean
You're the salt in the breeze
You're the spark
You're the smile in an old memory
When you're gone girl it won't be the last time
'Cause in the back of my mind

We got one last star in that Pensacola sky
One last sip of that rum and coke high
We got one last never gonna find nothing better
If it's goodbye make it last forever
One last wave crashing in on that coast
One last dance before I'm letting you go
We got one last kiss right here together
If it's goodbye make it last forever
Oh yeah
