You're Hepburn, I'm James Dean
You're black dress, I'm blue jeans
I'm fast cars, you're limousines
Ain't no two ways about it
You're Uptown, I'm up to no good
You're a better not, I'm a bet I would
Two different worlds, that's understood
But tonight there's a way around it

Let's just be honest
And call this what it is
Yeah we both want it
That up all night kinda kiss
Let's rock it right up to the morning light
When the sun comes up we don't gotta lie
We can say goodbye
It'll be alright, be honest
Girl let's just be honest yeah

Your hair's a mess, your heels are off
Your skin, your lips, your kiss so soft
Yeah there's a line we're 'bout to cross
And there ain't no turning back
Baby I'm cool with that
You might also like
Let's just be honest
And call this what it is
Yeah we both want it
That up all night kinda kiss
Let's rock it right up to the morning light
When the sun comes up we don't gotta lie
We can say goodbye
It'll be alright, be honest
Girl let's just be honest yeah

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Girl let's just be honest
Yeah you don't gotta lie to me
Baby that's alright with me
Yeah

Let's just be honest
And call this what it is
Yeah we both want it
That up all night kinda kiss
Let's rock it right up to the morning light
When the sun comes up we don't gotta lie
We can say goodbye
It'll be alright, be honest
Girl let's just be honest
Let's just be honest
Oh let's just be honest
