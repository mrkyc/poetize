Well, his after moan though cries oh no
He, he's building up a shine, but he takes it slow
And he knows it time to make a change here in time to get away
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reason
Oh time to end the pain

But he sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over
But why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over?

She said a "What would your mother think of all this?
How would your father react, oh Lord
Would he take it all back what have they done?
The way they said, "Take it, take it "
And he said "Make it with your own two hands"

That was my old man
And he said, "If all is grounded
You should go make a mountain out of air"

Oh, what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
Oh, recalling of the while we used to drive and jive here and there
Going nowhere but for us, nowhere but the two of us
And we knew it was time to take a chance here
And time to compromise our lives just a little while

And it was time for all the wrong
And lonely lonesome reasons
But time is often on my side
I've gonna give it to you tonight

And we sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over
But why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day
We sleep all, we sleep all day over
And over, over and over again?

And as time goes by, we get a little bit tired
Of waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun
To swim beneath over outside
Still they've reading between the lines
But they remember the part in the Hallmark card
Where they read about the dreams and are reaching for the stars
To hold on a little bit closer to

And they knew it was time, time to take and take love
Time to a chance here, time to compromise, to occupy their lives
And it was time for all the wrong reasons
Oh, but all time is often on my side, but I give it to you, oh boy
Sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over
So why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over? (Over)

She said a "What would your mother think of all this
How would your father react, oh Lord
Would he take it all back what have they done
The way they said, "Take it, take it "
And he said "Make it, don't break it with your own two hands"

Said that was my old man and he said
"If all, all is grounded then you should go make a mountain out of air"
And love go make a mountain, go on and on and on and on
And you should go on make a mountain out of
And hey, love go on and go on and go on and
Go on and make a mountain and go on and make a mountain
