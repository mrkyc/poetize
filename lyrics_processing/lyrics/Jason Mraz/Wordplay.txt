I've been all around the world, I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter in this generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said that ain't my scene
'Cause they need a new song like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Gotta find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top
Mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single? And it goes...

Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
It's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

Well, let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble and the lyrics never mumble
When the music's makin' people tongue-tied
You want a new song like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Gotta find another way to keep from going under
Pull out the stops
Got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay

Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
It's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
I built a bridge across the stream my consciousness
It always seems to be a flowin'
But I don't know which way my brain is going
Oh, the rhyming and the timing keeps the melodies inside me
And they're coming till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head?
Are you listening to a single word I've said?

Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the words I say
(Ha la la la la la)
I'm stickin' to the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
I'm stickin' to the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
I love the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
Of the ooh's and ah's and the fa-la-la's I'm back in love
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
