I picture something, it's beautiful
It's full of life, and it is all blue
I've seen the sunset on the beach, yeah
It makes me feel calm
When I'm calm, I feel good

And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings

I see birds fly across the sky
And everyone's heart flies together
Food is frying and people smiling
Like there is no other way to feel good

And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings
