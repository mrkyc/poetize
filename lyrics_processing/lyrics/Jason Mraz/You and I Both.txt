Was it you who spoke the words that
Things would happen but not to me?
Oh, things are gonna happen naturally
Oh, taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing
Oh, but often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright light turns to night
Oh, until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love, the love that I love, yeah
(Da da da da)

See, I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words than I had ever heard and I feel so alive

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Oh, love, love
You and I, you and I
Not so little, you and I, anymore, mmm

And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well, I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de
Well I'm almost finally, finally
Well, I'm free, oh, I'm free

And it's okay if you have to go away
Oh, just remember the telephone works both ways
But if I never ever hear them ring
If nothing else, I'll think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well, then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of, finally de de de de de de
