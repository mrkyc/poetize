Ok go, go hang your heart on, any tree
You can make yourself available to anybody
Cause every living' person knows you are a prize
Whichever way you go I'll be easy to find
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me
I don't ask for much

Think of this song as a promise, you can do what you want
If you decide you wanna move into a new stage
Deleting me from pages in your mission statement
My love is unconditional, make no mistake
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me

Who we are, when love is what it wants to be
We are free, and we are, having the best day ever by far
Being treated to the life, like a superstar

I can hold space while you see what your heart has to say about me
There's no dotted line to sign away your freedom
I acknowledge you for what you do to keep strong
I'll always stand beside you, don't get me wrong
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me

Who we are, when love is what it wants to be
We are free, and we are, having the best day ever by far
Being treated to the life, like a superstar

If I miscommunicated I apologies
If the picture that I painted wasn't very nice
My love is standing by you whatever you decide
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me

Who we are, when love is what it wants to be
We are free, and we are having the best day ever by far
