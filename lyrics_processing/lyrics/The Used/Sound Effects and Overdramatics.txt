When the shirt came off, it was all in time
When a m-m-m-minute turned into a mile
And then I broke that grin, and I cut it out
And you got all turned on by the taste of the ocean
When I mentioned blue, all you thought was color
When you mentioned drugs, all I thought was sober
When your pants came off and I turned you over
When you mentioned blue

Kill
Smile
Cut it out for me this time
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a little while

Keep the mask aligned
Get it up in time
There's a space between valleys
And try and catch a vibe
Make a circle square
A rectangle curve
Use a smile as a noun and I think like a verb

Run quick switch sides
Spill the filled up cancer
And the room is shaking
Now you're changing places
And I switched my pace
And my breathing races when you mention blue
