Let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time
Surely you can take some comfort knowing that you're mine
Just hold me tight, lay by my side
And let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time

I found my place in the world
Could stare at your face for the rest of my days

Now I can breathe
Turn my insides out and smother me
Warm and alive, I'm all over you
Would you smother me?

Let me be the one who never leaves you all alone
I hold my breath and lose the feeling that I'm on my own
(Leaves me all alone)
Hold me too tight, stay by my side
And let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time
(All the time)

I found my place in the world
Could stare at your face for the rest of my days

Now I can breathe
Turn my insides out and smother me
Warm and alive, I'm all over you
Would you smother me?
Smother me (Smother me)
Smother me (Smother me)

When I'm alone, time goes so slow
I need you here with me
And how my mistakes have made your heart break
Still need you here with me
So baby, I'm, baby, I'm here

Now I can breathe, turn my insides out
And smother me (Smother me)
Warm and alive, I'm all over you
Would you smother me?
Now I can breathe, turn my insides out
And smother me (Smother me)
Warm and alive, I'm all over you
Would you smother me?
Smother me (Smother me)
Smother me (Smother me)
Let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time
Let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time
Let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time
Let me be the one who calls you "baby"
The one who calls you "baby"
