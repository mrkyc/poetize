This feeling never leaves you alone
You pull the trigger on your own
You're hiding in your safe place
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly
All the way to the hospital
Now, will you ever rest your head?
You end up feeling mostly dead
Pretending you're the last one
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly
All the way to the hospital

Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all
Take off my mask, and leave the lies to the liars

It never used to hurt before
It isn't funny anymore
(It isn't funny anymore)
Feeling so alone now
Funny how you wish some way
That you could die at the hospital
You're quiet on the car ride home
You're waiting for your head to explode
You're hiding in your safe place
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly
All the way to the hospital

I don't feel okay!
I don't feel alright! Ah-ha-ha-ha...
Oh my god, I don't know...

Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all
Take off my mask, and leave the lies to the liars
(Before I close) Before I close my eyes, I'm gonna give it up
(Take off my mask) Take off my mask, and leave the lies to the liars
Leave the lies to the liars

Will you look them in the face?
Could you look me in the face?
Three cheers, you fooled them all
(C'mon, hip-hip-hooray!)
Three cheers, you fooled them all
(C'mon, hip-hip-hooray!)
Hip-hip-hooray!

Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all
Take off my mask, and leave the lies to the liars
(Before I close) Before I close my eyes, I'm gonna give it up
(Take off my mask) Take off my mask, and leave the lies to the liars
Leave the lies to the liars
(Hey! Hey! Hey!) Leave the lies to the liars
(Hey! Hey! Hey!) Leave the lies to the liars
(Hey! Hey! Hey!) Leave the lies to the liars
