He wears his heart safety-pinned to his backpack
His backpack is all that he knows
Shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple
The heart and devour the soul

All alone, he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside, to
Save his life, he crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird

Don't tell on me, don't tell on me
No, don't you tell on me, please
It's okay, don't tell on me, please...

Out of his mind, the weight pushes him, whisperin'
Must've been out of his mind (Out of his mind)
Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head
May be out of his mind (Out of his mind)

All alone, he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside, to
Save his life, he crawls like a worm (Crawls like a worm!)
Crawls like a worm from a bird (Crawls like a worm!)
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird

All he knows
If he can't relieve it, it grows
(All alone) And so it goes (And so it goes)
He crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird
And he crawls like a worm
He crawls like a worm
He crawls like a worm
Crawls like a...

Out of his mind, the weight pushes him, whispering
Must've been out of his mind

All alone, he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside, to
Save his life, he crawls like a worm from a bird
All alone, he's holding his breath half to death
(Holding his breath half to death)
Terrified, to save his life
He crawls like a worm (He crawls like a worm!)
Crawls like a worm from a bird (Crawls like a worm!)
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird
All alone
All alone
