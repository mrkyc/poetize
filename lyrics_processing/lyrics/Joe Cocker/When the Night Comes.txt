But for now there's something else that's calling me
So take me down that lonesome road
Point me east and let me go
That suitcase weighs me down with memories
I just want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone when the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes
Two spirits in the night
We can leave before the morning light
When there's nothing left to lose
There's nothing left to fear
So meet me on the edge of town
Won't keep you waiting I'll be around
Then you and I we'll just roll right out of here
I just want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone when the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes
You might also likeI know there'll be a time when you and I
Could take our hands and run away
Pick up all the pieces of this shattered dream
We're gonna make it out some day
We'll be coming back, coming back to stay
I want to be the one you run to
To be the one you come to
I want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you run to
I want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone
When the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
