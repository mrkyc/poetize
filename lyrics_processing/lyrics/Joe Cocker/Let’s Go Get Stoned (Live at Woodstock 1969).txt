Oh let's go get stoned
Let's go get stoned
Oh let's go get stoned
You know my baby, she won't let me in
I've got a few pennies, I'm gonna buy a big big bottle of Gin
Then I'm gonna call my buddy on the telephone and say
"Let's go get stoned"
I've been working so hard all day long
Everything I try to do will always seems turn out wrong
Well that's where I'm gonna stop now
On my way home
Baby, let's go get stoned
You know it ain't no harm
In gettin' a little taste
Oh don't blow your cool now
And start messin' up the man's place
I tell you that it ain't no harm my friend
In takin' a little nip now
Oh but don't fall down
Bustin' your lip
Let's go get stoned girl
Oh yeah, let's go get stoned
Walk down to the rocks
Let's go get stoned
Oh let's go get stoned
Let's go get stoned
It ain't no harm, no harm
Gettin' a taste
Oh don't blow your cool
And start messin' up the man's place
I said that it ain't no harm my friend
In takin' a little nip now
Oh but don't fall down
Bustin' your lip
Let's go get stoned
Oh let's go get stoned
Let's go get stoned
Oh let's go get stoned
Baby, let's go get stoned now, oh
Seems like there's going to be a little point somewhere till the end
You're talkin' about moon dust
Angel eyes, every other cannon does
Oh and if you, yeah
Oh baby, baby let's
Oh let's go
Let's all go and get stoned
Let's go get stoned
Let's go get stoned
Let's go get stoned, oh
I can't go on forever
Can't go on forever
Can't go on, can't go on forever
Where ever the Hell
I wanna live on the air
One love, one more
And I said let's
Oh let us go
