Mean what you wanted to mean
I'm listening, so be real with me
I've never known you to be
One that refuses to speak
You've never held anything back from me until now
What were you thinking?
I can see it in your eyes
You're scared for your life
And I would be too if I was you
I would be too if I was you!
Say what you wanted to say, mean what you wanted to mean
I'm listening, so be real with me
Say what you wanted to say, mean what you wanted to mean
I'm listening, so be real with me
I'll rip every single word right out of your dirty mouth
I'll rip every single word right out of your dirty mouth
Don't test me, I'll do it
I have all of the evidence, I'll prove it
Don't test me, I'll do it
I have all of the evidence!

Say what you wanted to say, mean what you wanted to mean
I'm listening, so be real with me
Say what you wanted to say, mean what you wanted to mean
I'm listening, so be real with me
How many days have I wasted, building you up while you tear me down?
I swear the next time you need me, I won't be around!
Everything we had is gone, It was gone in the blink of an eye
Pack all your bags, I've never been so ready to say goodbye
Love, hate, pleasure and pain
These are the words I could never explain
All I know is you made me feel every one and it will never happen again!
How am I to blame for all your mistakes?
You gave up the second you looked away
I really hope you got what you wanted
Now wash your hands clean of me
Won't you wash your hands clean of me?
I forgive you, I just want you to leave
For better or for worse, It never meant a thing
I forgive you, I just want you to leave
