Inside my body I'm a stranger
Stuck in a place that never changes
The world around me seems unaffected
But here I am behind the bars in my own prison
Behind the bars in my own prison!

All my worst memories on repeat
It's like my mind is stuck on rewind
It's a vicious cycle and I can't break free (can't break free)
I'm holding on but it won't be long 'till

I get so deep inside
I don't think I'll be coming out alive!
I tell myself that everything's all right but
I can't believe it when I know it's a lie

I feel the pressure and it's harder to breathe
Is it too late to make an escape to
Somewhere that I might have a second to think
Without this dark cloud following me

Locked inside of a nightmare
I think I threw away the key
And I'm so afraid of the ending
Cause all I see is me losing
You might also like
I get so deep inside
I don't think I'll be coming out alive!
I tell myself that everything's all right but
I can't believe it when I know it's a lie
All of reality starts to disappear again (disappear again)
When I'm stuck inside my head, someone get me out of it!

When I scream in my dreams, no one hears me
And when I wake I'm still alone so I fall back asleep (back asleep)
When I bleed I start to feel but it leaves me empty
I start to believe there's no saving me
I used to think I had it under control
Now darkness follows everywhere that I go
No one can see it so I feel all alone
I'm dying inside but I don't let it show
My walls are caving in (are caving in)
I'm suffocating! Get me out!

I get so deep inside
I don't think I'll be coming out alive!
I tell myself that everything's all right but
I can't believe it when I know it's a lie
All of reality starts to disappear again (disappear again)
When I'm stuck inside my head, someone get me out of it!
My eyes start to cross and I am slipping away again
God, I hope it's not the end
