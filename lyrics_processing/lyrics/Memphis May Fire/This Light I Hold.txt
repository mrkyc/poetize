I feel the spotlight, I see their eyes
They lit a fire just to burn me alive
I feel the judgement, I hear the lies
But I won't go down without a fight!
I won't go down without a fight!
I'm not going down!

I hear them twist my words, and mock everything I'm sayin'
They hope I'll crash and burn but I'm here and I'm stayin'
It's like everywhere I turn, my enemies are waitin'
To hurt me cause they hurt. So I keep on prayin'

I feel the spotlight, I see their eyes
They lit a fire just to burn me alive
I feel the judgement, I hear the lies
But I won't come down without a fight!

I'm here, and I'm not leaving till I'm finished
With every punch you throw. (I'll get back up and go)
Hate me, but I never said you had to listen
This story is my own
This light I hold will glow
You might also like
They stabbed me in the back
But these scars have made me stronger
Always under attack but I can't be conquered
Remind me of what I lack, and hope I won't last much longer
Try to push me off track, but I'll stay right here with my honour

I'm here, and I'm not leaving till I'm finished
With every punch you throw. (I'll get back up and go)
Hate me, but I never said you had to listen
This story is my own
This light I hold will glow
This light I hold will glow
You should know by now you can't just push me out
I will not let this go
I might be bruised and beat, but I am on my feet
You'll never win this war (This story is my own)
With my hands raised up high
I'll keep fighting the good fight and I am not alone
THIS LIGHT I HOLD WILL GLOW!


I'm here, and I'm not leaving till I'm finished
With every punch you throw. (I'll get back up and go)
Hate me, but I never said you had to listen
This story is my own
This light I hold will glow
This light I hold will glow
I feel the spotlight, I see their eyes
They lit a fire just to burn me alive
I feel the judgement, I hear the lies
