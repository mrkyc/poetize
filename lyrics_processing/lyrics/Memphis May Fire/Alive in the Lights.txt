I embraced it, but you didn't
Your normal life, nine to five
It's just not for me
I need to feel alive!
I won't fall like the rest of them
They've come and gone with the wind
I hear the doubt in the back of your mind
But still I'll see this through to the end
Maybe if you paid more attention
Asked more questions and actually listened
You would see this is not just a dream
But a path I've chosen that means everything to me

Don't you see the minds that have changed?
Don't you see the lives that have been saved?
Don't you care to see the difference I've made?

Listen closely, the highways call my name
Don't you see this is my everything?
It may not seem right to you
And you might not approve but it's real
This is the only thing that makes me feel
You might also likeWhat more do I have to do
To finally prove myself to you?
What is it that you need to see
To finally believe this is who I'm supposed to be?
Most days I feel like your punching bag
But I would never let it hold me back
I just wish for once you knew
How it felt to be brought down lower than everything else

Don't you care to see the difference I've made?

Listen closely, the highways call my name
Don't you see this is my everything?
It may not seem right to you
And you might not approve but it's real
This is the only thing that makes me feel
This is who I am! This is my life
I come alive in the lights!
I come alive in the lights

What will be written on your tombstone?
You sat behind a desk
You had no backbone
What will be written on your tombstone?
You sold your soul, grew old alone
Would you prefer that I become a lifeless
Hollow shell such as yourself?
Would you prefer that I give up my dreams
And lose all hope just like everyone else?
Don't you see the lives that have been saved?

Listen closely, the highways call my name
Don't you see this is my everything?
It may not seem right to you
And you might not approve but it's real
