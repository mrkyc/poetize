Tug of war, back and forth
All regard goes, out the door
Set your sights on goals, and awards, become obsessed, and watch success unfold
Decrease the morals, increase the funds
Don't be to preachy if you want to be loved
Forget conviction, just have some fun
Mindless words can take you to number one

Say I'm selfish
Say I've changed
Say I abandoned what I set out to be
Say I'm different, now say I'm lost
But I'll stay true no matter what the cost

I'll stand and fight for what I love, and know is right
I'll carry on
I'll carry on
Until my days are gone
You can try to turn me into something I am not
But I'll stay strong
I'll carry on
Until my days are gone
You might also like
Careful, what you say
They don't need to know what you believe
God forbid, I stand for something
God forbid, I stand alone
God forbid I tell my story
God forbid, it offers hope
Sell your soul for platinum
Deny the truth for gold
You can be the next big thing if you turn your back on what you know

I'll stand and fight for what I love, and know is right
I'll carry on
I'll carry on
Until my days are gone
You can try to turn me into something I am not
But I'll stay strong
I'll carry on
Until my days are gone

I will never be like you
I'm not a puppet on a string
I'm not one of your machines
I'm not doing this for you
I'm not doing this for me
It's bigger than what you choose to see
I'll stand and fight for what I love and know is right
I will carry on
Until my days are gone
They try to turn me into something I am not
But I will carry on, I will carry on
