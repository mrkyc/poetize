I been headed to the bottom of the barrel for a while now
I think I need to slow down
I been blaming everybody but myself and yet somehow
I feel the weight deep down

Yeah, you know me
Making friends with all my demons
Never lonely
Self-destructive and I know it
But it's only
A matter of time
Before I'm outta my mind
I think I need a lifeline

I don't know when I became somebody
Somebody I don't recognize
I swear to God I never saw this coming
I never thought I'd leave it all behind
I want it, don't need it, I had to realize
I hate it, I feel it, believe my own lies
I really think that I could use somebody
Somebody to bring me back to life
You might also like
Sometimes it comes in waves and hits me outta nowhere like a hurricane
Feels like I'm going insane
I don't wanna be a problem but my self-control's a losing game
When the venom's in my veins

Yeah, you know me
Making friends with all my demons
Never lonely
Self-destructive and I know it
But it's only
A matter of time
Before I'm outta my mind
I wish that I could rewind

I don't know when I became somebody
Somebody I don't recognize
I swear to God I never saw this coming
I never thought I'd leave it all behind
I want it, don't need it, I had to realize
I hate it, I feel it, believe my own lies
I really think that I could use somebody
Somebody to bring me back to life
Yeah, you know me
Making friends with all my demons
Never lonely
Self-destructive and I know it
But it's only
A matter of time
Before it's flatline, vital signs
Can I be revived?
Can I be revived?

I don't know when I became somebody
Somebody I don't recognize
I swear to God I never saw this coming
I never thought I'd leave it all behind
I want it, don't need it, I had to realize
I hate it, I feel it, believe my own lies
I really think that I could use somebody
Somebody to bring me back to life

Can I be revived?
