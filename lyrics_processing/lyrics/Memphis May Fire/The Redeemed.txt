Let go of everything!
What is it that you are holding on to?
What will it matter when every history book is consumed in the flames?
Soon it will be like you never existed
Not a single soul will remember your name!
Everyone is flawed
Everyone has a story to tell
But every story has an ending
So stop acting like there won't be one!
These bones are only, only temporary (Let go of all you know.)
You're on your own, but not alone
You'll never be alone
These bones are temporary
Let go of all you know (Let go of all you know)
The destination lies ahead
And we are not alone
We are not alone!
Forget then, live right now
Everything rides on tomorrow
When that day comes will you hear (will you hear)
"Well done, well done."?
You might also likeYour eternity is worth so much more than their opinions of you
Defined not by where you've been
Knowing that you'll be made new!
These bones are only, only temporary (Let go of all you know)
You're on your own, but not alone
You'll never be alone
These bones are temporary
Let go of all you know (Let go of all you know)
The destination lies ahead
And we are not alone
We are not alone!
I can't say
The past will never get in the way
Just remember, all things come and go
But they don't mean a thing
It's not about what you have now
It's what you have in store
Let go
The destination lies ahead
And we are not alone (It's not about what you have now, what do you have in store?)
Let go
These bones are only temporary
We are not alone (It's not about what you have now, what do you have in store?)
Let go (These bones are only temporary)
The destination lies ahead
And we are not alone (You're on your own, but not alone, what do you have in store?)
Let go (These bones are only temporary)
These bones are only temporary
