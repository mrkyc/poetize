Another day, she sets foot in this prison
Dreading what they'll say
So much to give, but no one ever listens
She dreams of running away
Crippled by the way they make her feel
She takes a look at her wrists and turns to the blade
It's not a cry for attention if she just wants to feel
Anything other than the pain

Everyone deserves to be loved
But they make her hate everything she was sure of
Every day feels like her against the world
Now she's afraid she'll never be enough

No one knows all the weight that she holds when she feels alone
The memories, they haunt her
No one sees all the pain she brings everywhere she goes
She feels they'll never want her

She dreams of a day when she won't have to cry herself to sleep
Staring at the scars on her wrists
She knows this is not who she wants to be
You might also like
Another night, all alone with her thoughts
Dwelling on the questions that race through her head
Scared to sleep, scared to wake up and face the day
When she can't forget the things that they said

No one knows all the weight that she holds when she feels alone
(The memories, they haunt her)
No one sees all the pain she brings everywhere she goes
(She feels they'll never want her)
All she wants is someone to notice
(So sick of feeling invisible)
All she needs is someone to care
(If only they could see that she's incredible)

She dreams of a day when she won't have to cry herself to sleep
Is our generation too blind to see true beauty lies beneath the skin?
So ignorant

Are they too cold, too numb
To see the lifelong effects of the pain they inflict?
(Of the pain they inflict)
Is our generation too blind to see true beauty lies beneath the skin?
(Beneath the skin!)
No one knows all the weight that she holds when she feels alone
No one sees all the pain she brings everywhere she goes

No one knows all the weight that she holds when she feels alone
(The memories, they haunt her)
No one sees all the pain she brings everywhere she goes
(She feels they'll never want her)
All she wants is someone to notice
(So sick of feeling invisible)
All she needs is someone to care
(If only they could see that she's incredible)

She dreams of a day when she won't have to cry herself to sleep
Staring at the scars on her wrists
