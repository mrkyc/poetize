We paid a little closer attention to all of this
Your slight of hand is an old trick
And I see right through your wit
So I'll ask you
Can you keep your word?
Or is this where we go our separate ways?
Can you keep your word?
Never again will I trust what you say!
I never thought I could be so blind
But now I say
If I could go back
Do it all again
You know that I wouldn't sign my life away
You won't get away with this!
You won't get away with this!
Silent when we needed you!
You won't get away with this!
You won't get away with this!
Silent when we needed you!
I was too blind to see that
You were too deaf to hear me
Just know if I could go back
This would all be different
This would all be different
You might also likeOh, no, you must have mistaken me
For someone just as fake as you
You broken every promise you made!
No, I don't expect you to know what it feels like
I just want you to admit
That you are a thief
You're a thief!
You're a thief!
You're a thief!
Don't take it too hard my friend
That I feel this way
It's just that
I was too blind to see that
You were too deaf to hear me
Just know if I could go back
This would all be different
This would all be different
Your excuses mean nothing
When nothing means more than keeping your word
Oh please
Like I haven't heard them before?
I don't think you'll ever learn
You killed the trust
All of the trust that I put in you!
You killed the trust
And I'll never trust you again!
I was too blind to see that
You were too deaf to hear me
Just know if I could go back
This would all be different
I was too blind to see that
You were too deaf to hear me
Just know if I could go back
