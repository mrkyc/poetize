'Cause I've been feeling empty
I never used to be so dead inside
I think I lost my memory
I can't remember carefree
And all my days turn into fight or flight
I wanna get back, tell me how to get back
I wanna get back, tell me how to get back
Say it again, say it again, tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me that I'm gonna be fine and there's nothing left to fear
'Cause I've been losing sleep (Losing sleep)
Trying to get back to who I used to be
Where is the old me?
(What happened to the old me?)
I don't like who I've become
A hollow shell of someone
And I feel like a stranger to myself
I don't need to start over
I just need to get back to when
I didn't wake up to this hell I'm in
Say it again, say it again, tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me that I'm gonna be fine and there's nothing left to fear
'Cause I've been losing sleep (Losing sleep)
Trying to get back to who I used to be
Where is the old me?
(What happened to the old me?)
You might also likeI wanna get back, tell me how to get back
I wanna get back, tell me how to get back
Get back!
I wanna get back to when I didn't think about
The chance of everything I never thought I'd live without
But when I look around the only thing I see
Is the broken pieces of the person who I used to be
Say it again, say it again, tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me that I'm gonna be fine and there's nothing left to fear
'Cause I've been losing sleep (Losing sleep)
Trying to get back to who I used to be
Where is the old me?
(What happened to the old me?)
