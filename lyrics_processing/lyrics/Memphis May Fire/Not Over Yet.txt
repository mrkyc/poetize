She used to feel beautiful
Before the world made her feel so small
Now she prays that she just won't feel at all
He used to believe he was strong
Undefeated by this army of one
Before the voices told him he was wrong

Don't let your fears keep you from dreaming
It's all a lie when you believe you can't
If you're not trying you're dying
So grab the wheel with your hands

When they try to tell you
That your one and only shot failed
It's not over yet!
Keep pushing forward
And I know one day you'll prevail
It's not over yet!
(It's not over yet, it's not over yet
It's not over yet!)

Falling down is life
Living is getting back up again
Don't let your spirit die
Keep fighting for a passion and a will to live 
Cause I believe that
Your spark can start a fire
You might also like
When they try to tell you
That your one and only shot failed
It's not over yet!
Keep pushing forward
And I know one day you'll prevail
It's not over yet!
Let your fears fall by the wayside
It's not over yet

Take what they say
And turn it inside out
There's a Silver lining in the clouds of doubt
Lean into the storm with
Open arms and let them know
You didn't come this far to just let go
I believe that your spark can start a fire!

When they try to tell you
That your one and only shot failed
It's not over yet!
Keep pushing forward
And I know one day you'll prevail
It's not over yet!
Let your fears fall by the wayside
(Let your fears go, let your fears go)
Keep on fighting for a better life
It's not over yet, yeah!
Dream on, dream on!
In the middle of the storm
Raise your fist and scream
