But until then, I need you to know you make me sick!
I know that you think that you're changing
I know that you think you're perfect
But your yesterday is a joke
And everyone's heard it all before!
You'll never give me what I know I deserve
The same as all of the rest but with half the nerve!
I should have known (I should have known!)
I should have seen
How much was wrong
You're a mistake
You're a mistake, a disease on my soul!
I can't believe I thought I had you figured out
I should have known
I should have seen how much was wrong
I should have known
I should have seen that you were broken
You were broken from the start
I gave you all of of me
Put you first in line, such a waste of time
I was always yours, you were never mine
How could you leave me standing outside?
You might also likeYou're such a sick, sad waste of a human being!
I hope you're happy, go paint that smile
Right back on your face, you're so fake
I'm so tired of all the generic excuses
So this, this is where I draw the line
With every "I love you" you left me more empty
And now it is so obvious
You were broken
You were broken from the start
I should have known
I should have seen how much was wrong!
I gave you all of of me
Put you first in line, such a waste of time
I was always yours, you were never mine
How could you leave me standing outside?
When you hear these words
And wonder if they're about you
Don't call and complain
You know there's truth
In every word that I say!
You're such a sick, sad waste of a human being!
You're such a sick, sad waste of a human being!
I gave you all of of me
Put you first in line, such a waste of time
I was always yours, you were never mine
How could you leave me standing outside?
I gave you all of me
Such a waste of time
This is where I draw the line!
