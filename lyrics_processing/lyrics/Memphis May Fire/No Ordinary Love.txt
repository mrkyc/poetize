Nothing more than a broken man staring death in the face
All my mistakes have got a hold on me again
Here we go
Another day, another fork in the road
I never know who to trust
Will someone just tell me which way to go?
I need a sign
I need a miracle
I need to know that this is possible
I've just failed so many times
Is there any way that I could make it right?
God, if you're there I need to hear you now
Come back to me love, I forgive you
Oh how I've missed you
Just know every time you run I'll be right here waiting
This is no ordinary love
Listen up, listen up
This is no ordinary love
This is unconditional
I'm so afraid to admit that you're real
Cause I'm afraid of what I might feel
When your words start to come to life
And it brings my demons into the light but I know you're here
I shiver as you whisper in my ear, "Child have no fear"
You might also likeCome back to me love, I forgive you
Oh how I've missed you
Just know every time you run I'll be right here waiting
Come back to me love
I hope you know I'm always with you
I forgive you
We lose faith in things unseen
Unsure of what to believe
Just dying to be loved when love's right in front of us
We give up on our hopes and dreams, and let doubt take everything
The door will open when we realize we don't hold the key
I tried to save myself but I failed
Come back to me love, I forgive you
Oh how I've missed you
Just know every time you run I'll be right here waiting
Come back to me love
I hope you know I'm always with you
