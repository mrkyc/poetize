If I've learned anything
It's that everybody's fake
No one means what they say
Just pick a side for heaven's sake
Yeah, yeah, you hate me
Go on and blame me
I know in your eyes I could never get it right

You want me dead but I'm alive
'Cause I will never lose
What you could never find (Never find, never find)
I won't forget but I'll survive
'Cause this is the last time
I let you bleed me dry

Criticize my every move
But I'm here to set the record straight
You wouldn't last a day in my shoes
And taking cheap shots doesn't make you brave
So say you hate me
Go on and blame me
When push comes to shove and bend comes to break
Nothing you say matters anyway
You might also like
You want me dead but I'm alive
'Cause I will never lose
What you could never find (Never find, never find)
I won't forget but I'll survive
'Cause this is the last time
I let you bleed me dry

I've seen life that turned into dust
'Cause parasites are not meant to trust
So when the leech comes back for blood
I've got no choice but to cut, cut, cut
Yeah
Cut, cut you out

You want me dead but I'm alive (But I'm alive)
I won't forget but I'll survive (I will survive)

You want me dead but I'm alive
'Cause I will never lose (I will never lose)
What you could never find (Never find, never find)
I won't forget but I'll survive
'Cause this is the last time
I let you bleed me dry
You want me dead but I'm alive
'Cause I will never lose
What you could never find (Never find, never find)
I won't forget but I'll survive
'Cause this is the last time
I let you bleed me dry
(Bleed me dry)
