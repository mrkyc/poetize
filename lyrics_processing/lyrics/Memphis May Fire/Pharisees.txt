Somewhere along the line you must have missed the point, this is not about you
You twist the words of The Gospel to glorify yourself, but this is not about you!
Take the spotlight off the things that you've done & realize he did what you never could
He carries the weight that you could never hold & even if you had the chance you never would
Hypocrite!
You think you're superior?
Hypocrite!
Do you really think belittling is the cure?

You walk around with your head held high as if you're not the one that's living a lie
You're living a lie!
What makes you think that you'll change their minds?
They'll never see the light if all you preach is hate from a mountain top that you couldn't climb

Say what you want, but behind closed doors you fight the same demons as everyone else.
Say what you will, but you look like a fool to the rest of the world that knows that no one's perfect
You live a lie!
Modern day Pharisees
Open up your eyes!
You never practice what you preach
You live a lie!
Modern day Pharisees
Open up your eyes!
You never practice what you preach
Who gave you the right?

What makes you think that you'll change their minds?
They'll never see the light if all you preach is hate from a mountaintop that you couldn't climb

The next time you feel the right to preach about Commandments that you know you do not keep, realize that it was Grace that saved you and do us all a favour, keep your self-righteous mouth shut!
Keep your mouth shut!

Keep your self-righteous mouth shut!
GRACE! GRACE! GRACE! GRACE!
We are all at the mercy of, GRACE! GRACE! GRACE! GRACE!
You are no different than the rest of us

You walk around with your head held high as if you're not the one that's living a lie
You're living a lie!
What makes you think that you'll change their minds?
They'll never see the light if all you preach is hate from a mountaintop that you couldn't climb
From a mountaintop that you could never climb!
