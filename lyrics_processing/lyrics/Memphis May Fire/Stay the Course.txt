This life of mine is no coincidence
I've seen the world and I will never bow down
So bring your temptation to the table, but I'm not giving in
(Never giving in)
Tell me I'm wrong because I'm different, but I'm not giving in
(Never giving in)
Time spent waiting for truth to come out of a lie
Is time that's wasted, so waste away but you're not wasting mine
I am not a product of mistake. I've got a purpose & I'm living it out
This life of mine is no coincidence. I've seen the world & I will never bow down
Never bow down, never bow down
I might walk this road alone, but I know that it's taking me home
I know that you're bringing me back where I belong
When everyone tells me that I am wrong
I'll stay strong because I'm on my way home
I have seen, I've heard, I've felt your unfailing love & I'll never be the same
Nothing can break me
No weapon formed against me shall prosper. This is a war you've already won. So no matter what comes my way, I'll stay the course
I might walk this road alone, but I know that it's taking me home. I know you're bringing me back, bringing me back where I belong. When every voice I hear is saying I'm wrong
I stay strong because I'm on my way home
You might also likeOn my way home
On my way home
On my way home
I'm on my way!
I spend my days living for what is to come
No evil can stand in my way because you've already won
You've already won!
I might walk this road alone
I might walk this road alone, but I know that it's taking me home
I know that you're bringing me back where I belong
When every voice I hear is saying I'm wrong
I stay strong because I'm on my way home
