(Three, two, one)

Staring at the wall, I never thought this would be so hard
How could have I been so close and never known you?
I never knew, I never knew you at all
You will always be my father, but I hope you know
It's your fault that I'll never know what that means
You left a void that never could be replaced
I am dying inside, but you will never see

I always had hoped that you did not want it this way
But no matter how hard I try you always pushed me away
You said you loved me, but

How was I supposed to know?
(How was I supposed to know?)
When you left me here, you left me here alone?
(You left me here alone?)
Do I ever even cross your mind, just for a second?
(Do) Do (You) you know I'm alive?

You know I would let you in, but you threw everything away
So tell me, what did you get from all of these years of pain?
You have no clue what I've been through
But I guess that you wanted it that way
You might also like

If you would've been there (If you would've been there)
If you would've stuck around (If you would've stuck around)
If you would've been there when I needed you
You would've been, you would've been so proud (So proud)

(You said you loved me, but)
