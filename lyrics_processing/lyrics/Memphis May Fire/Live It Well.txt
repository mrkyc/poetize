Am I being honest with myself?
Is this where I'm supposed to be?
Am I really making a difference
For something bigger than me?
What will I leave behind?
What will they say when I die?

What is the story my life will tell
And did I tell it with my whole heart?
Did I live it for more than myself
And did I live it well? Did I live it well?

If I see the door and don't walk through it
Is the blood on my hands?
Tell me I'm thinking too much when You already have a plan
I know I feel this way cause I'm afraid
That I won't add up to standards I create

What will my story be?
What is the story my life will tell
And did I tell it with my whole heart?
Did I live it for more than myself
And did I live it well? Did I live it well?
Was I the hero or the villain?
Was I a hypocrite or did I live it?
What is the story my life will tell
And did I live it well? Did I live it well?

Did I make them proud? (Make them proud)
Did I live out loud? (Live out loud)
Will they remember me
For something more than just the words I sing?

When I go I want to know
That I left something more than just a name on a stone
When I leave I hope they see
That I chose to live my life for something bigger than me

What will they say when I die?
What is the story of my life will tell
And did I tell it with my whole heart?
Did I live it for more than myself
And did I live it well? Did I live it well?
Was I the hero or the villain?
Was I a hypocrite or did I live it?
What is the story my life will tell
And did I live it well? Did I live it well?
In the end when all is said and done
And I take my last breath, did I live it well?
