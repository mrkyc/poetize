I pack my bags and say goodbye to my wife
For what seems like the millionth time
They said it gets easier, but they lied
She looks at me and says "Really baby, I will be just fine."
But then she looks away so I don't have to see her cry
And that is when I ask myself

How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, because I left my heart at home
She needs me, but I know they need me too
So God give me the strength to do, what you created me to do

Well really I'm so thankful for the people I meet, the places I've been and the things I've seen
But when she's not here it doesn't feel like I'm living my dreams
I know they say, that no one is perfect, but I swear she's perfect for me
And that makes it so much harder to leave

How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, because I left my heart at home
She needs me, but I know they need me too
So God give me the strength to do what you created me to do
You might also like
If you miss me, I'm just a phone call away
Please be strong, be strong for me
I need you to show me how to change the inside of me
For my heart, for their sake, please be strong, be strong for me

How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, so alone
How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, because I left my heart at home
She needs me, but I know they need me too
