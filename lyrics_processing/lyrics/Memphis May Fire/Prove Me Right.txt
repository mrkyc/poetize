We put our lives in the hands of the ones that claimed they truly cared
Come to find it's all just a lie and when we needed them no one was there!

I swear I'm not bitter
I just see them for what they are;
Money Hungry Cowards!
Sucking the blood out of artists and killing the art!
So count out the money you stole from starving artists you watched pave the way
But you know just as well as I do, without us you're just an empty name!

Where were you when they had no faith in us?
Where were you when they shut us out?
(It's funny you show up now)
And if it fell apart I know that you'd be nowhere to be found
We did this on our own
Thanks for nothing!

The ones that kicked me when I was down
Are the same ones that say they need me now
That's fine, I'll play the game but just know
I told you so!
You might also like
I've seen the greed in their eyes
Well I guess I'm nothing but a dollar sign
I've seen the greed in their eyes
Well I guess I'm nothing but a dollar sign

Four years gone by, now everything is fine, no thanks to you
You'll never know, nor do you care about what it took or the things we've been through!

Where were you when they had no faith in us?
Where were you when they shut us out?
(It's funny you show up now)
And if it fell apart I know that you'd be nowhere to be found
We did this on our own
Thanks for nothing!

Ignorance had me by the throat
From the day I learned how to sing
But now my eyes are open wide
And this is what I see

I see the greed in their eyes!
They had me fooled at first because I believed, all the lies!
Oh, the lies!
I see the greed in their eyes!
They had us fooled at first but we're taking control this time
We're taking control this time!
Where were you when they had no faith in us?
Where were you when they shut us out?
It's funny you show up now
And if it fell apart I know that you'd be nowhere to be found
We did this on our own
Thanks for nothing!

So count your money and I'll count my friends
