As they come to life
As they come to life
I feel my heart beat right out of my chest
And I think I might be losing the fight
(I might be losing it)
I live inside my poisoned mind
It leaves me paralyzed (it leaves me paralyzed)
My visions blurred
My words are slurred
I think I might, might die tonight
This shadow follows me
It always keeps me on the edge
I know that I would never jump
So why can't I step back from the ledge?
Am I losing control?
You take me to the darkest places I have ever been
I think I feel it coming back again
Why am I terrified of everything I used to love
Save me from myself I don't want to hate who I've become
Inhale, exhale
Why is it so hard to breathe
Inhale exhale
Why isn't this working?!
If I live to see the other side of this
I swear I'll never take for granted any happiness
I never knew what I had until it was gone
How long will this go on?
You might also likeWhy am I terrified of everything I used to love
Save me from myself I don't want to hate who I've become
Tell me that tomorrow when I wake up I'll be fine
I just want to be myself again
I want to know that I'm alive
Tell me is there something that I'm learning from this?
I try my best to make the most of it
Maybe i just need to see the bigger picture
Show me how it ends
If I have to feel this forever
I'd rather feel nothing at all

Bring me back to life
I just can't take another sleepless night
Bring me back to life
Give me the clarity to see the light
I know that you can take this away
So I'm praying that today is the day
Oh, I pray that today is the day
Bring me back to life
Why am I terrified of everything I used to love
Save me from myself I don't want to hate who I've become
Tell me that tomorrow when I wake up I'll be fine
I just want to be myself again
I want to know that I'm alive
Please give me peace
Give me joy
Give me sanity
Give me hope
Give me love
