Disguisded as men
They are
Paying no consequence for their actions
Soon we'll all give in
I say the same things
Over and over and over again
But you act like you never heard them
We were created
To set an example
So what is this?
What is this?
This is the same old story
This is the same old scene
We're living our lives
Right out of a magazine
I guess we'll never know
Have we gone from little to less
To nothing at all?
Nothing at all?
It seems like every soul has been sold
For a dollar or less
I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been
How good it could have been
You might also likeSavor every breath
That enters your lungs
I promise it won't last forever
But until you realize
You were wrong
You'll be far gone
Savor every breath that enters your lungs
I promise it won't last forever
And by the time you realize
You were wrong
You'll be far gone
Follow me or back out now
Follow me with all your heart
Or back out
Back out now
We all swim in a sea of pride
Where character is rare (where character is rare)
With every passing day
It only gets worse
And no one seems to care
We all die
Wondering what if I
What if I would have tried
While your begging for life on your knees
You'll realize
You were never happy
Have we
Gone from
Little to less
To nothing at all
Nothing at all?
It seems like every soul
Has been sold
For a dollar or less
I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been
The clouds begin
To move in rhythm
There is a storm in the sky
I will cause a disaster
Create an earthquake
And watch as you shake
I will cause a disaster
Watch as you shake
We all die
What if I would have tried
What if I would have tried
I guess we'll never know
It seems like every soul has been sold
For a dollar or less
I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been
