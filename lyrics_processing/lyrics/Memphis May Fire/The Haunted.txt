From your ear against mine
Made me a victim to love
A love that was never divine
You were my first
I hated it all
Oh I hated it all
Always there to show me
The next place to fall

Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye

Perfectly covered in blood
And I saw right through you
Evil!
Pure Evil!
Evil!
The look in your eyes
Your intentions were poison

Soon I'll wake up from this nightmare
And I will be happy
And you'll be alone
I saw right through you
Your intentions were poison
I saw right through you
It's the look in your eyes
Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Here is to hoping that I
That I can forget everything
About that night
Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Here is to hoping that I
