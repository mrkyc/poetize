I gave you all my heart just to watch it get thrown away (Thrown away!)
It takes a toll on my soul, because I'm starting to believe that love's just a game we play
Is it all just a game?
One day I'll heal but I'll be covered in scars, and i'll never forget watching it all fall apart when you finally came clean about the lies & the games that you played from the start
It's like every second we spent together is always on repeat in the back of my mind
What was I thinking when I gave you my life?
You knew it would end
You knew this would die!
You'll never find another one like me

I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one
I think I have room in my heart, but I simply reserved none
I let you beg on your knee's for forgive at last, but you're just a mistake
Please give me my life back
You made me so insecure and unsure of everything that I thought was real
I just wish I could rewind and go back to a time where I knew what it was
Like to feel
I hope something, somewhere ruins you the way you ruined me
I just want you know how it feels
I want you too see it's like my heart was made to be broken
Why can't I let go?
Now that it's over I just need you to know
You might also like
I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one
I think I have room in my heart, but I simply reserved none
I let you beg on your knee's for forgive at last, but you're just a mistake
Please give me my life
Give me my life back
They say it's better to have loved than never at all
But I can't seem to find how it could have been thrown at the wall
I'm not sure I can stand above this taller
Tossing, turning, at the edge
I thought I'd be over you but no
With all you've put me through I'm full of regret
I wish I could just forget somehow
You'll never find another one like me

I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one
I think I have room in my heart, but I simply reserved none
I let you beg on your knee's for forgive at last, but you're just a mistake
Please give me my life back
Please give me my life back
