Digging a hole that I can't get out of
Deeper and deeper below the surface to find that there's nothing
There, where do I go from here?
Give me something that I can feel
Back and forth, here we go again
What will it take to keep it together?
What will it take to keep it together?
What will it take? What will it take?
What will it take to keep it together?
I've never felt so empty

Keep me close, keep me close
Keep my head above water
I need to hear your voice
I can't do this on my own

Beneath the sun I am rotting
Just like the ones that came before me
I cannot deny my own walk has become a crawl
I've never felt so, I've never felt so lost

I know I could never run far enough
To escape your love (To escape your love)
So why do I keep running?
Now the chaos is all around me
Show me the light at the end of the tunnel
I need you to save me from myself
Give me something I can feel
You might also like
Keep me close, keep me close
Keep my head above water
I need to hear your voice
I can't do this on my own (I can't do this on my own)
Keep me close, keep me close (Keep my head above water)
I can't do this on my own

Take all my guilt
Take all my pride, I want to know you sincerely
I'm on my knees
Take all of me, I want to feel you here with me
Feel you here with me
Take all my guilt, take all my pride
I want to feel you here with me

Keep me close, keep me close
Keep my head above water
I need to hear your voice
I can't do this on my own (I can't do this on my own)
Keep me close, keep me close (Keep my head above water)
