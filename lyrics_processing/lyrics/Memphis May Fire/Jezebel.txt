She's on the prowl
She wants it all
And she'll stop at nothing
Everyone knows
She's well aware of the fact
That her self respect was long lost
On her search for something

First in line
To give it up to the guy at the bar
Buying two drinks at a time
One track mind
It's disgusting that she thinks
She's got it all figured out

But what she doesn't know
Is that to us she's just another one of them
Girls like you are a dime a dozen

Just leave! Just leave!
We're all better off without your disease, disease!
Take your pick from the willing
But you'll never get me
It's obvious the stage is all that you see
So take your pick from the willing
But you'll never get me
You might also likeJust go!

The innocent look on her face is all fake
She's worn out and worn down
From all the one night stands
Never any interest in a real man
Or a love that will last

Oh what a waste!
What a waste of a beautiful face
(What a beautiful face)
Was it the way she was raised
Or just the terrible choices she's chosen to make?

Every night it's all the same
She steals another heart so she can drop another name
Oh what a shame!
You're all the same
You're all the same!

All dressed up in purple and pink
She'll do whatever it takes to get to VIP
She thinks everyone wants to see her down on her knees
But what she doesn't know is everyone just wants her to leave!
Just leave! Just leave!
We're all better off without your disease, disease!
Take your pick from the willing
But you'll never get me
It's obvious the stage is all that you see
So take your pick from the willing
But you'll never get me

I can feel her staring at me
From across the room
She's got the worst of intentions
And she smells like trouble and cheap perfume
She's got one thing on her mind
Her target locked in sight
She never gets denied
But tonight she'll be surprised
She knows every word to every song I write
So let's have a sing-a-long
Hello, hello, hello and goodbye!

One track mind
You wanna check me off the list? Yah right!
The stage is all you see
So take your pick from the willing
