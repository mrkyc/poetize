Remember when you said we were in this together?
We only had one goal in mind:
To be the best that we could be for each other;
To look ahead and put our differences aside

I can swear that you're a different person now
All you want these days is a fight
I could've sworn that this would end up different
But I'm tired of trying
Cause we can't see eye to eye
We don't see eye to eye!

I feel the separation
It's time that you go your way, I'll go mine

All I ever wanted was the best for us
Then out of nowhere you were out of touch
I really think I should've done this sooner
I only wish I would've never gave so much

I feel the separation
It's time that you go your way, I'll go mine
I watched you change into everything you use to hate
And push me away, cause you're scared of what I'll say
You might also likeI didn't want this, it kills me inside
I have no choice but to sever the ties

What happened to the you I use to know?
Was it ever real, or was it just a show?
The trust, the love, the bond we had, where did it go?
Where did it go?
What happened to the you I use to know?
I poured out, gave you everything
Now I wish I could take it back
Go now, far away from me
Before I lose what little patience I have
I believed every lie you told
And now I think that I am better off alone
You only took and always asked for more
Now give me back every part of my life you stole

I watched you change into everything you use to hate
And push me away, cause you're scared of what I'll say
I didn't want this, it kills me inside
