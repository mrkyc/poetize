I want it, I got it
It's like I just can't get enough
I see it, I need it
More of whatever keeps me numb
I feel it consuming
But I'll ignore that till I die
I want what they have and
I won't stop until it's mine

I fear myself
Becoming calloused and unable to feel
Greed takes over;
I lose control and question what is real
I want more than I need, the American dream
Take and take until I have everything
Now I'm covered in greed
And the reflection I see
Doesn't look like the man I want to be!

I spent my life chasing after things
That I fought for and now I'm torn
Cause none of it has ever satisfied my soul
It just leaves me wanting more
You might also like
I know that it's wrong but
It feels so right, I can't deny
I'm losing this war with
My self-indulgent life

What if I gave it all away
And shed the layers of the selfishness I hate?
I want to be free but I'm so afraid (I'm so afraid)
That I am too far gone and I'm stuck with all
The choices I have made

There has to be more to life
Cause I got it all, and never got it right
There's got to be more than this
Tell me there is something that I missed

I spent my life chasing after things
That I fought for and now I'm torn
Cause none of it has ever satisfied my soul
It just leaves me wanting more
I gave myself to things I thought I loved
But they never gave me enough
Now I'm right back where I started from
I'm so sick of wanting more
I'm so sick of wanting more!
Want and want and want
Until we want to die
Because we never find
What we're looking for
What are we looking for?
Consume, consume, consume
Until it consumes us
Want and want and want
When will it stop?
(When will it stop?)

I spent my life chasing after things
That I fought for and now I'm torn
Cause none of it has ever satisfied my soul
It just leaves me wanting more
I gave myself to things I thought I loved
But they never gave me enough
Now I'm right back where I started from
I'm so sick of wanting more
