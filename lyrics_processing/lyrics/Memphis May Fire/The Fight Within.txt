As I walk on down this road
I know I'm not alone
But sometimes I feel no hope
When it gets too dark to see
The light in front of me
I remember what I've seen

I might be lost until I reach the end
But I'll keep moving
With every step I know I'll fall again
But I'll get through it
'Cause when I think I'm about to break
I can see my growth in pain, so
I might be lost but I'll find the fight within

Like a stranger in my skin
I'm afraid of who I've been
But it started where it ends
No, I've seen this all before
Is there peace beyond this war
When I can't take anymore?
(Can't take anymore)

I might be lost until I reach the end
But I'll keep moving
With every step I know I'll fall again
But I'll get up
'Cause just when I think I'm about to break
I can see my growth in pain, so
I might be lost but I'll find the fight within

(I might be lost but I find the fight within)
As I walk on down this road
I know I'm not alone
But sometimes I feel no hope
There is hope

I might be lost until I reach the end
But I'll keep moving
With every step I know I'll fall again
But I'll get through it
'Cause when I think I'm about to break
I can see my growth in pain, so
I might be lost but I'll find the fight within (There is hope)
I might be lost until I reach the end
But I'll keep moving
With every step I know I'll fall again
But I'll get through it
'Cause when I think I'm about to break
I can see my growth in pain, so
I might be lost but I'll find the fight within
I might be lost until I reach the end
But I'll keep moving
With every step I know I'll fall again
But I'll get through it
'Cause when I think I'm about to break
I can see my growth in pain, so
