It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damned old for me
All that really mattered was you were my girlfriend
And baby, that's all that mattered to me

Let me love you down, even if it takes all night
Let me love you down, you know it's gonna be so right

Remember when I drove me home from work?
I loved the way when you kissed me bye
All your friends think I'm just too young for you
You tell 'em, I can do what guys their age can do, oh baby

Let me love you down, even if it takes all night
Let me love you down, you know it's got to be so right
Let me love you down, even if it takes all night
Let me love you down, you know it's got to be so right, oh

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damned old for me, mmm
All that really mattered was you were my girlfriend
And baby, that's all that mattered to me, oh baby
