Does anyone have any time to play?
(No smoking, sir) (No smoking)
Does anyone have any?
One, one, one
(No smoking) (No smoking, sir)
Two, two, two
Three, three, three (No smoking)
Four, four, four

I could go on counting for hours, the things that I like
Please don't move, baby stay right here, stay right on my side
I don't mind if you turn your back on me, 'cause I know you're still good
Even if I wanna turn mine, in this position I don't think I could
(36, 36) I always dreamed of your measurements in neon lights
(24) But personally speakin', baby, you can light up my room
And brighten up my nights (36)

I never had a girl before with much of a figure
So excuse me if I start to play with your digital display
You might also like
(Digital display) I wish your breeze would start to blow
(Digital display) To make your digits wanna show
(Digital display) I could cool you off all day
(Digital display) From your digital display

You always did know how to make one beg
For they already should've had
But since I know how to make you digits show I feel that I don't have to ask
Take my hand and I'll take you yours and we'll guide it in the right way
And when it's there you can tell your friends how you made my digit display

You're what I've been waiting for to raise my low score
'Cause I've been striking out all day, and it makes me feel this way

(Digital display) Like it, can't get enough
(Digital display) When the going gets tough
(Digital display) I just want my part to play
(Digital display) With your digital display (Play)


I never had a girl before with much of a figure
So excuse me if I start to play with your digital display
(Digital display) I wish your breeze would start to blow
(Digital display) To make your digits wanna show
(Digital display) I could cool you off all day
(Digital display) From your digital display


Digital, digital, display, display
Digital, digital, digital, digital
Can I play?
One, one, one
Two, two, two
Three, three, three
Four, four, four
Like they always say
What's good for the goose is always good for the gander
Oh, Sheila
