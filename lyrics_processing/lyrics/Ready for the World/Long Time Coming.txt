And waiting on the phone to ring
Should I worry
Should I care
If you'll call me tonite
I'm jumping in my car
And going too damn fast for me
Should I make it
Will she fake it
When we do it tonite
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming for you
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming for you
If your mother
Only knew what I did to you
Would she hate me
Would she like me
When we do it tonite
In the morning
When I rise
Will I see your face
Will I be wrong, if I stay long
So we can do it tonite
