Baby, let me love you
I just want to hold you
Baby, let me be your love
Saw you with your lover
Things were lookin' naughty
Thought I'd be the only one

But I don't know if I should love you
Baby, because you're new
And in the morning, will you love me?
But I don't care

Baby, let me love you
I just want to hold you
Baby, let me be your love
Saw you with your lover
Thought I'd be the other
Baby, let me be the one

But I don't know if I should love you
Baby, because you're new
And in the morning, will you love me
Or have a new walk?
Baby, baby
You might also like
In the morning, will you love me forevermore?
And in the morning I'll just let you know, let you know
You've got a new walk

Baby, let me love you
I just want to hold you
Baby, let me be your love
Saw you with your lover
Things were lookin' naughty
Thought I'd be the only one
Baby, let me love you
I just want to hold you
Baby, let me be your love
Saw you with your lover
Things were lookin' naughty
Thought I'd be the only one, oh

But I don't know if I should love you
Baby, because you're new
And in the morning, I'll just let you know, let you know
You've got a new walk
And in the morning, will you kiss me, baby
Or will you care?
Oh, in the morning I'll just let you know, let you know
You've got a new walk
Baby, let me love you
I know I could
Baby, let me be the one
Saw you with your lover
Things were lookin' naughty
Thought I'd be the only one
Baby, let me love you
I know I could
Let me be the one, yeah
Let me love you
Let me love you forevermore
I just wanna hold you forevermore
I just wanna love you, oh
