I'm sick and tired and lonely and sitting in my room
Staring at the shadows, blowing smoke rings at the moon
Every night I try, every night I cry, tryin' to work out why
I just wanna know, got to know, why you keep on pushing me, baby
You love me when you want and take me when you need
Whatever you say to me, baby, make my poor heart bleed
Now I don't wanna win, but, I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna be alone no more, no more
I just wanna give you love, I just got to give you love
But you keep on giving love
You give another man your love
Ooh baby, don't you leave me this way
Don't you leave me
I never wanna hurt you, don't wanna tie you down
But every time I take a look in the mirror
I can see the heartache hanging 'round
I'm going down to the ground
Why you always wanna bring me down?
Baby, baby, why do you always bring me down?
'Cause you keep on giving love
You give another man your love
Baby, baby, don't you leave me this way
Don't you leave me, baby, baby, baby
My heart is aching, my heart is breaking for you
And I can't take it anymore, no more, no more
You might also likeI'm sick and tired and lonely, nothing left to say
Just thinking 'bout you, baby, takes all my night and day
All my nights, all my days, ooh
Baby, babe, you take my breath away
'Cause you keep on giving love
You give another man your love
Baby, baby, baby, don't you leave me this way
I can't stop my love from falling down
I wanna love you in the morning
Wanna love you in the evening time
Don't you leave me, baby
Don't you ever leave me, baby
Don't you leave me, baby, no
