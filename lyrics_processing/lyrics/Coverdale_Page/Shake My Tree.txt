Now I don't wanna be your slave
You're trying to drive me to an early grave
All I ever hear is that you live and breathe for me
But all you ever do, baby, is shake my tree

'Cause you keep on pushing, baby
Like you never, ever been in love before

I told you once and I told you twice
I ain't no schoolboy you can sacrifice
You want my love and you want it now
You try to love me, baby, but you don't know how

So you keep on pushing, baby
Like you've never, ever been in love before

I need love and I need time
And a little bit of both if you wanna be a friend of mine
Don't want no woman drive me outta my head
And you're the kind of girl guaranteed to wreck my bed
You might also like
Love is what you need
But you cut down to the bone and make me bleed
I give you everything and still you cry
Ooh mama, the price of loving you is way too high

But you keep on talking, baby
I've heard it all before
Now I don't want you hanging around or kicking at my door

But, you keep on pushing, mama
Like you never, ever been in love before

I know love and I know shame
And I ain't gonna get caught up in your game
It took a little time to make me see
I ain't looking for a woman like you to shake my tree

So keep on talking, baby
Keep on hanging 'round
Everything you do to me is sure to drag me down
And you keep on pushing, mama
Like you never, ever been in love before
Shake my tree

I don't want to be your slave
You're trying to drive me to an early grave
You keep on talking, no matter what you say
I've had enough of your kind of love to last me all my days

So keep on pushing, baby
I've heard it all before
I don't want you hanging around or kicking at my door

Now I don't want your loving, baby, I can't take it anymore
I don't want you hanging 'round, kicking at my door
If I see your face again, I'll give you what's in store
But, you'll keep on pushing, baby
