All the memories unfold
Thinking 'bout the friends we lost
Wondering how to count the cost
Now my days are growing cold
I can hardly wait any longer
Now the feeling's growing stronger
Thinking 'bout the times we had
Good times always turn into bad
Now my days are growing cold
Why don't you take me for a little while
Sing me songs you know will make me smile
Why don't you take me for a little while
As I watch the rising sun
I see a new day just begun
Thinking 'bout the sacrifice
Wondering how to pay the price
Now my world is growing cold
Why don't you take me for a little while
Sing me songs you know will make me smile, make me smile
Why don't you take me for a little while, yeah
