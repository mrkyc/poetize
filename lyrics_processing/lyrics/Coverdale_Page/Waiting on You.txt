Every way I turn, I know this love is gonna burn me
But I'm waiting on you, no matter what you do
Ever since you went away, I suffer each and every day
And I can't hide the heartache anymore
You left me all alone, just waiting by the telephone
Too scared to step outside this prison door
And I'm waiting on you
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
This heart is dedicated to you
Till the rivers run dry and the sun no longer shines
I'm still gonna make you mine
I'm waiting on you
Waiting on you
Ever since I started drinking, my ship's been slowly sinking
So tell me what's a man supposed to do
When people stop and stare and see me drowning in despair
'Cause it's written on my face, what I've been going through
And I'm waiting on you
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
This heart is dedicated to you
Till the rivers run dry and the sun no longer shines
I'm still gonna make you mine
You might also likeI'm waiting on you, waiting on you
I'm waiting on you, waiting on you
Yeah
My heart is breaking, my whole life is shaking
Every way I turn, I know this love is gonna burn
This love is gonna burn, love is gonna burn
Burn me, baby, burn, your love is gonna burn
Ever since you went away, I've suffered each and every day
And I can't hide the loneliness no more
All the tears I've cried, all the love I've been denied
And still you find me waiting on you, baby baby babe
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
This heart is dedicated to you
Till the rivers run dry and the sun no longer shines
I'll be waiting on you, waiting on you
My heart is dedicated to you
And I'm waiting on you, waiting on you
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
This heart is dedicated to you
Till the rivers run dry
I'll be waiting on you, waiting on you
My heart is dedicated to you
And I'm waiting on you, waiting on you
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
My heart is dedicated to you
