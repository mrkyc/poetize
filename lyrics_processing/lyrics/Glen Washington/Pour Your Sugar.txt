I've tried to explain this feeling
That's taken a hold on me
I can't comprehend the magnitude
So I'm just gonna let it be
I cherish the way I'm feeling
The things you are doing to me
I can't believe this is happening
A blessing for all to see
I can't believe this is happening
So I'm just gonna let it be

I love the way I'm feeling
My life has a brand new meaning
I feel so happy
I see heaven in her eyes
Oh, this love she's given to me

This high that has taken me over
Daily her presence I seek
Give me life, give me strength, let me testify
Without you I'm feeling weak

For someone as lovely as she
And if I should die without her in my life
A sad day in history

A sad day in history

My life has a brand new meaning

Ever pleasant is all around me
