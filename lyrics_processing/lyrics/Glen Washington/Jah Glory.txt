His mercies endureth for me
Wooy
Let's rise and shine and give Jah the glory
His mercy endureth for me
Make me free like a bird in a tree
Let's sing and shout his praises forever
So the world can see
Give thanks and praise to his majesty
Knowing that he is the conquering lion
And he can set you free
Jah children open your eyes and see
The meek shall inherit the earth
And the wicked shall get his reward
Promise to give you the world
But don't listen dem boys they a fraud
They'll never get away no no no, no no no
And if you're weary, tired and heavy laden
Your burden you know he will bear
Jah will protect you so have no fear
You shall be like trees planted by the river
Living with humbleness there
No more in bondage real(?) niceness must we share
You might also likeThe meek shall inherit the earth
And the wicked shall get his reward
Promise to give you the world
But don't listen, dem boys they a fraud
They'll never get away no no no
Never get away
Ooh-eeh
Let us stand and give Jah Jah all the glory
Come let us worship His name
He's yesterday and forever the same
He can never fail
He won't put us to shame
When we call on his name
Remeber livity is not a game
The ship of the slaver won't sail
And my people are not for sale
Trying to put us in jail
But they come to no avail
They bound to fail
You know they're bound to fail
Let's rise and shine and give Jah the glory
His mercy endureth for me
Make me free like a bird in a tree
Let's sing and shout his praises forever
So the world can see
Give thanks and praise to his majesty
Let's rise and shine and give Jah the glory
His mercy endureth for me
Make me free like a bird in a tree
His mercy endureth for me
Yeah yeah ...
For all the world to see
Ooh-eeh
