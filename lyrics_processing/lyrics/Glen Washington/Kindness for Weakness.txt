I just can't live without you no, no way
Ooh

Now, many men will try to tell you bad things about me
Oh baby, let them try
I know one day their lust will die
And there will be no cause or reason for you to doubt me
'Cause what I feel is real
The love that I have is yours, signed and sealed
Now I'm building my whole wide world around you
But baby here's what my request for you

Baby, don't take my kindness for weakness
Please, don't take my sweetness for weakness
No, baby don't take my kindness for weakness
No, no baby
'Cause our future depends on you
And no one else will do
Ooh

And every breath I take, I'll take another one for you
Because I want you in my life, now baby
And every song I sing, I'll be singing with feelings about you
With feelings of love so pure and true
There is no way I can live my life without you, baby
But this I desire from you
You might also like
Baby, don't take my kindness for weakness, no no
Don't take my sweetness for weakness
Please, don't take my kindness for weakness
No, no baby
'Cause everything depends on you
And no one else will do
No, no, no
No baby

I'll do almost anything you ask me to
Always willing to set aside the tribulations you put me through
And people will criticize that, you and me, they don't think that is wise
And everything that I do they are willing and able to publicize
I got all bets on you, and waiting to finally receive my prize
No matter how men rule, our future is growing inside of you
Baby, time is the master
With Jah blessings we will prosper
I am placing all bets on you

But baby, don't take my kindness for weakness
No baby, don't take my sweetness for weakness
Please, don't take my kindness for weakness
Oh baby, don't take my sweetness for weakness, no baby
Don't take my kindness for weakness
