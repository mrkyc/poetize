Oh no no no, not my baby
We were only strangers in the night
Getting to know each other
The mood was right
Strolling under the moonlight, hoping that we could get out of sight
And while the entertainer's singing his song
I hold that feeling, oh so strong
Never thought love would look me in the eyes
I lift my head, oh what a big surprise
But there are people all around
Who try to take your love from me
No, no, no
They don't seem to realize
This love was meant to be
Only your love can set me free
I think I won the prize
From the very first time I looked in your eyes
I knew love would last forever
It's a blessing to be with someone like you
Now the ladies realize
I am no longer solo, got you by my side
And this new love I will treasure
I'll be faithful and true till the day I die
And when people criticize
We will hold unto love, Jah be our guide
And if I had to do it over
It would have to be you girl
No one else could do, no, no
I can't let you go
Oh no, no, no, not my baby no baby
I can't let you walk out my life
No, no, no, no
I can't let you go
Oooh, no, no, no baby
Now they can't understand
How could she be in love with someone like me
But they don't seem to realize
That this love was meant to be
Only your love can set me free
We were just strangers in the night
Getting to know each other, the mood was right
Strolling under the moonlight
Hoping that we could get out of sight
And while the entertainer singing his song
I hold the feeling, oh, so strong
Never thought love would look me in the eyes
I lift my head, oh, what a big surprise
I may have won the prize
From the very first time I looked into your eyes
I knew love would last forever
It's a blessing to be with someone like you
No, no baby
Can't let you go
Oh no, no, no, no, no
I can't let you walk out of my life
No, no, baby, baby
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
No, no, no, no, no, no
Ooh baby
We were only strangers in the night
Can't let you go
