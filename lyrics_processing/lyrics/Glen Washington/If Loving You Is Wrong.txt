If being right means being without you, I'd rather be wrong during life
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame, it's a down right disgrace
But 'long as I got you by my side, I don't care what your people say
Your friends tell you it's no future in loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want, I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing I got a wife and two little children depending on me too
And am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Knowing I got someone else at home who needs me just as much
And are you wrong to give your love to a married man
And am I wrong for tryin' to hold on to the best thing I ever had
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right, no no
Are you wrong to give your love to a married man
And am I wrong for tryin' to hold on to the best thing I ever had
