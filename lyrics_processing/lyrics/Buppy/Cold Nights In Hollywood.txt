Yeah, Hollywood is still cold
I feel pain and I get lonely when the night slows
Kill my mind you hate me sober
Where do I go?
When you scream and tell me the decision final
Where does time go?
Oh where does-

Time passed quick, I said goodbye at six
I know we can't be fixed
It's time to sink this ship
I'm tired of sailing 'round the problem thinking you are what is best for me
Gave you everything but you would still hate what is left of me
I'm done
What's to lose?
Tie the knot along this noose
And don't you let me loose
Feel my pain inside this room
Cause it's the same one where you said that you're in love
And it's the same one where you told me you were done

Tip toe around the truth
It's cold in this world
Frostbite on my tooth
Now I'm hoping to leave
Don't you hold onto me
No I won't let you have me back

Yeah, Hollywood is still cold
I feel pain and I get lonely when the night slows
Kill my mind you hate me sober
Where do I go?
When you scream and tell me the decision final
Where does time go?
Oh where does time go?

Sittin' on the Hollywood sign
I got some things on my mind
That I can't tell you tonight
But I don't think I'll be here when you wake up
Cause I've been hearing voices since the breakup
They say it's cold out here
This city makes for freezing flesh and bones could tear
They take the soul right out your chest and hold it there
So don't you call this place home
Cause Hollywood is still cold
Cause Hollywood is still cold
Cause Hollywood is still cold

Tip toe around the truth
It's cold in this world
Frostbite on my tooth
Now I'm hoping to leave
Don't you hold onto me
No I won't let you have me back
Yeah, Hollywood is still cold
I feel pain and I get lonely when the night slows
Kill my mind you hate me sober
Where do I go?
When you scream and tell me the decision final
Where does time go?
