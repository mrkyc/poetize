Yeah Yeah

Life is what you make it, tell me what you tryna be?
I know I'm gon' make it, ain't no "well I'm tryna be"
If mom was around I know she would be proud of me, yeah
This one for them clowns talking down doubting me
Boy I told ya
Gotta show you the power
I'm taking the lead, aye
This is my time
Go ahead have a seat
I put my life on the line
This is blood, sweat and tears
All the days I was down
Thank the Lord that I'm here, yeah
Not a day that I don't think about it
Wish it was different but if it was different who would I be if I was here without it?
Ima live regardless
Ima go the hardest and you know it, aye
Struggling made me heroic, aye
I'm spitting this work like a poetic
Not sipping no Moet, not smoking no potent
You might also likeCan't you tell I'm saved and sanctified?
Came out the dark to his precious light
I remember waking up every night tryna figure it out
Now I know the Lord got my side
Man I'm so thankful
Yeah it was painful
But I'm guarded by angels
I know my enemies watching
They time is tick tocking while I'm breaking bread at the table, woah

Every day a blessing
Every week I'm working
Every month I'm learning
Every 3 I'm earning
I know God has a plan for me and here's my reason
Cause I'm getting better every season
Every Season
Every Season
Cause I'm getting better every season
Every Season
Every Season
Cause I'm getting better every season

I know from my battles I was made to win
Reason why I hustle even through the struggle
The light shines in the dark and leaves the darkness puzzled
That's why when I show up y'all know y'all all in trouble
Oh boy
Nothing can compare to this new joy
It's nothing like knowing that you got the gift
Holy confidence
Put your faith in what you want
You don't got to wish
Had no pot to piss
But I'm on now
Got my mind right
I'm in the zone now
Cut a couple friends
Had to tie those ends
Everybody don't want what you want now
Are you feeling my vibe?
Tired of working a 9 to 5 just to survive
I should be out living life
Vacay on vacay and popping champagne with my Wife
Gave up my whole life for Christ
Not that I'm perfect but working to do what is right
This didn't start overnight
It was always here but my flesh was dodging the light
It was cool living in secret
Sleeping with women I know I probably shouldn't be with
Had to throw that in the open
So you can see that I haven't always been this decent
Now look at me
Thanking God that I'm happy
Thanking God for his grace
Thanking God that I'm standing
Yeah

Every day a blessing
Every week I'm working
Every month I'm learning
Every 3 I'm earning
I know God has a plan for me and here's my reason
Cause I'm getting better every season
Every Season
Every Season
Cause I'm getting better every season
Every Season
Every Season
Cause I'm getting better every season
