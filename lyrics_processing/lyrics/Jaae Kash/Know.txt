I ain't afraid to tell it like it is
Yeah

Heart been cold lately I'm a different man
Thought 'bout giving up but God had different plans
That hurt and pain led me to a distant land
Got me shouting got me doubting if He will or can
Where's all this power? Are you on the throne?
Tell me where to go when I feel all alone
My father ain't around and my mama gone
And I bet you all I got my ex is moving on
So what you want?
Look what you need from me?
Don't tell me simple things like "just believe" homie
Cause all of that praying and planting seeds
Just left my heart broke with swollen knees
Is it in vain?
Do you know my name?
Do you see my pain?
Do you feel my shame?
Do you hear my tear drops on your window pane?
Can I trust you with my heart or you just runnin' game?

When life gets hard where do I go?
My head is down my shoulders low
And it seems like time is moving slow

Yeah
Cause I'm too close to the edge
I watched my mother cough up spit while watching shows in the bed
My old thing told me "get a grip" so many thoughts in my head
The closest people to me switched
What I do to get
All of that and this
God do I deserve it?
I need a way
I need your grace
I need a breakthrough
Or are you mad at my mistakes and turned your face too?
Keep me posted you don't owe me nothing only punishment
I can't help it I'm so selfish I need all that I can get
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Are you with me? Are you near me?
I been through and through and really I ain't hearing from you clearly
Is it in vain?
Do you know my name?
Do you see my pain?
Do you feel my shame?
Do you hear my tear drops on your window pane?
Can I trust you with my heart or you just runnin' game?
