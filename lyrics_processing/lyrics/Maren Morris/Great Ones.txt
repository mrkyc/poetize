Before you found me
Baby, my heart and all around me was like a graveyard
I didn't sleep alone, but never felt more lonely
I tried for so long to get it right, but
You get it so wrong until the right love
Makes you realize that there's a one and only

You just fell out of the sky
The best things come when you don't even try
Lightning in a bottle doesn't happen twice
The kind of gospel that saves you just in time
The myth of me and you is fiction turned to truth
Most loves don't make it through, but the great ones do
But the great ones, yeah, the great ones, yeah, the great ones do
But the great ones, the great ones do

It's like every single star aligning
We traded silver for gold lining
You're the perfect storm, so let it pour down on me
If they tell the story in a hundred years
No one would believe that you and me were really here
Just a memory of what the real thing can be

But the great ones, yeah, the great ones, yeah, the great ones do
But the great ones, the great ones do

You know when you know and I know you do
And I know that I just love you
Sometimes it feels just too good to be true, but it's true
Yeah, somehow it's true that

You just fell out of the sky
The best things come when you don't even try
Lightning in a bottle doesn't happen twice
