I'm done fillin' a cup with a hole in the bottom
I'm takin' an axe to the tree
The rot at the roots is the root of the problem
But you wanna blame it on me

I hung around longer than anyone should
You've broken my heart more than anyone could
Tryin' to stop me won't do you no good
I've already planted the seeds

Ooh, do you hear that?
It's the sound of a new wind blowin'
Ooh, do you feel that?
Heart lettin' go of the weight it's been holdin'
I've made miracles in the shadows
But now that I'm out in the sun
I'll never stop growin', wherever I'm goin'
Hope I'm not the only one

I'm done fillin' a cup with a hole in the bottom
And screamin' the truth to a liar
Spent ten thousand hours tryna fight it with flowers
And the tree was already on fire
Yeah, the tree was already on fire

Ooh, ooh, hey

Ooh, do you see that?
It's the light of a better day dawnin'
Ooh, do you hear that?
It's the sound of a tree fallin'

Ooh, do you hear that?
It's the sound of a new wind blowin'
Ooh, do you feel that?
Heart lettin' go of the weight it's been holdin'
