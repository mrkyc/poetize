Ain't gonna water down my words or sugar up my spice
Sometimes the truth don't always come out nice
Just gonna do me and you don't have to listen
And if you don't like the heat, then get out of the kitchen

I'm cookin' up my own flavor
Even if it ain't your style
You only see one layer
Original could take a while
Making a mess, straight out of scratch
Think what you think about that
Oh, I'm just trying to make good a little bit greater
I'm cookin' up my own flavor
I'm cookin' up my own flavor

If it ain't familiar, it's 'cause you ain't had it yet
Even if you don't like it, I bet you won't forget
There's always one or two pushing on the envelope
So I'ma raise a glass to you if you're one of those

I'm cookin' up my own flavor
Even if it ain't your style
You only see one layer
Original could take a while
Making a mess, straight out of scratch
Think what you think about that
Oh, I'm just trying to make good a little bit greater
I'm cookin' up my own flavor
I'm cookin' up my own flavor

Shut up and sing? Well, hell no, I won't

I'm cookin' up my own flavor
Even if it ain't your style
You only see one layer
Original could take a while
Making a mess, straight out of scratch
