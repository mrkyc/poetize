What you do with trash? You take it out
So why are you lettin' him hang around?
Girl, you gotta know when to clean house
And throw his shit out in the yard
If it was the first time, I would understand
But it's the third time, he got a second chance
There's a fine line between an accident
And an L-O-S-E-R

It's bullshit, you know it
Yeah, I see it in your eyes
Every time that you tell me
Deep down, he's a really good guy

That's like sayin' drunk girls don't cry
Girl, you must be outta your damn mind
You say he saw the light, the slate is clean
Swears up and down that it's gonna be
Different this time
That's like sayin' drunk girls don't cry (Hey, na-na-na-na)

I wish I had a dime for
Every time that you tell me
Deep down, he's a really good guy
