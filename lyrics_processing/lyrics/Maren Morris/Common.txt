Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

I've been tryna carry on
But I'm crushed under the weight
Of the world where I belong
But I don't feel at home, yeah
When it's over, when it's done
When we're standing at the gates
Will we see that all along, yeah
We're a different kind of same?

How do we get to the bottom of this
When we're sitting on the top?
Hey, the people, they tell me it's just how it is
Like it's never gonna stop

But we got way too much in common
So what's the point in fighting?
We got way too many problems if I'm being honest
I don't know what God is
'Cause we've got way too much in common (Mmm, mmm)
Way too much in common (Mmm, mmm)
Way too much in common
