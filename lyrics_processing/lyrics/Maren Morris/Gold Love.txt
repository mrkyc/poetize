Baby, I was way past the point of saving
But you didn't try to save me, you just let it be
Called me up, "Say, let's go get a drink"
We don't even have to say a thing

But we talked a while 'bout our dreams
Our lives, our saints
How you like to hear me sing

I guess I always knew there was something more to you
If my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine
Your gold love gets me through
Gets me through, gets me through

Fascinated by the facets of me I hated
The beauty that I kept shaded
You brought the sun around
Said I'm too good to be on the ground
You wanna hold me, but you'll never hold me down

Yeah, you saw the hurt through the pain
Saw the sparks through the rain
After that drink, I never was the same
