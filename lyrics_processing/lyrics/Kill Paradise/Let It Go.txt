I remember when I had no fears
Hold me blind with hands over my eyes
Hide me from your lies
But you forgot to cover up my ears
And all I hear is what you are saying, feels like complaining
Complain, complain, it all sounds the same
Just a waste of my eye and my ear space
So keep it up, I'll run away
And run these feet to a beat that I appreciate

So keep it up, I'll run away
You're out of place like the devil on a Sunday
So break apart these picture frames
Because you're to evil for love anyway

Do you remember writing letters?
"It's forever" like you'd fallen in love?
You lie like a rug
And in the morning when you're sober, this is over
I can give you a ride, but this is goodbye
You had your time, now stay away
Keep your sails set abroad with the castaways
My eyes go blind by brighter days
The headache's better than the pain from the noise you make
You might also like
So keep it up, I'll run away
You're out of place like the devil on a Sunday
So break apart these picture frames
Because you're to evil for love anyway
So let it go
Break apart from the feeling you use to know
Let it go, let it go
Break apart from the feeling you use to know

Searching far and wide, but look inside
Looking for a place to run and hide
Search for reasons why this is goodbye
Sorry my mistake, sorry my mistake

So keep it up, I'll run away
You're out of place like the devil on a Sunday
So break apart these picture frames
Because you're to evil for love anyway
So let it go
Break apart from the feeling you use to know
Let it go, let it go
