Can't wait to break my way through these walls
From the silly little scene that they saw
Launching from all their fake catapults
Then falling faster than lead cannon balls
They see, they see what we can be
They're reinacting everything that everybody's seen
But missing vital things that love and passion brings
Not what I had in mind
Here we go, never looking back again
On the open road with my best friends
We work hard, but we play harder
And everything we've been through proves our hearts are
In it for the music and the melody
I believe in finding simple beauty
The bright lights, long drives, foreign street signs
So live it up because we're leaving at sunrise
I've been lied too, I've been sold
Jealousy tied the knot in your biased blindfold
So cut it off and see the other side
Don't let them hold you back
Break out and see what life is really like
And as I walk home, I see a shadow
I take a look back at what I fought for
We always knew it was a matter of time
I know that we'll be fine

On the open road with my best friends
We work hard, but we play harder
And everything we've been through proves our hearts are

I believe in finding simple beauty
The bright lights, long drives, foreign street signs
So live it up because we're leaving at sunrise
