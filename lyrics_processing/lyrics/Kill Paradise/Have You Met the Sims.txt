Twenty years old with a heavy weight on my shoulders, encaving
I'm older but saving
Your life is more precious than you could even decide
I know, please trust me
I feel so alive I could drink a chardonnay on an aeroplane
Just trust me now
So where did everyone go?
And you don't even know, so don't pretend like you do
It's just a set-up for all your failures
You're always playing out you're so dang cool
So where did everyone go?
And you don't even know, so don't pretend like you do
It's just a set-up for all your failures
You're always playing out you're so dang cool
Reading up on a Sunday paper
Don't forget you're almost better tapered
Everyone wishes for sentiment on a Sunday
Even though it's a sweater-vest Sunday
You know you're better than her
You know you're always my favorite type of personality
Where's Ally, is she with me? All you have to do is ask me
I'll give you a twenty-three if they made it in a bill-form
Baby, where's your bill for (your bill for)
I can make everything seem just personal
Put it in the mix, make sure I'm the stick
I'll make that every opportunity stick
Where we can always take a cinnamon stick in a chocolate mix on our holidays
Baby, cry

So what happens to the people who get deleted and they go home?
No one even knows who they are but they have computers and a rated type of red car
Who knows a metaphor goes, a cliche grows, and an attitude is always stoned
But that's just me, I pound the keys and make the money for my family
Heh, I wish
