With empty bottles and wine on the wall
Living everyday just like it was the weekend
We had no care at all
And I, I've never lived like this before
And Bobby just got thrown out the front door
And that night, the neighbors called the cops again
'Cause Bobby was passed out on their front porch
Oh, I'm feeling alright
Got money in my pocket, going out tonight
Oh, oh-oh, Break the stereotype
You know it now
I'm gonna party with my best friends
Oh, I'm feeling alright
Got money in my pocket, going out tonight
Oh, oh-oh, Break the stereotype
You know it now
I'm gonna party with my best friends
Oh-oh, party with my best friends Just got home from some shows on the West Coast
Turning twenty-one at midnight
And everything that I miss when I'm not home
Is coming back in my life
And I, was superstoked to see this girl
But then she walked in with some other guy
So I kissed some girl I've never met before
You should've seen the twinkle in her eye
