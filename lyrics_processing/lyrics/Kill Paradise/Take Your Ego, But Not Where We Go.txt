Behind the doors that are closed, and the walls we can't break
This was the one chance we gave, but you just didn't take
I'm so sorry you're lost and refuse to relate
This is my life, I do what I wanna
So sit and hate, I know that you're gonna 

Let me tell you something you should already know
If you read between the lines, then all your lies will start to show, so
Break it quick, I didn't forget
About the bad ideas you came up with that just won't ever sit, so
So take your ego, but not where we go
Because where we go, there is no ego
Yeah take your evil, and turn it around
Come on, come on, and live
What are you so mad about?
Go, go, run your mouth, it's not your taste
But if you've got something to say, come up and say it to my face
You pick the time, and I'll pick the place
Betting bigger than in Vegas, and I bet you'll run away
Run home, all alone, blood on your face
Kiss your ego, you and me know that all you are is a fake, so
You might also likeSo take your ego, but not where we go
Take your ego, but not where we go

Won't ever change
'Cause I know what I wanna be 
I know what I wanna be
I know what I wanna see
And that's just not you and me
'Cause me and you don't agree 
Go, go, run your mouth, it's not your taste
But if you've got something to say, come up and say it to my face
You pick the time, and I'll pick the place
Betting bigger than in Vegas, and I bet you'll run away
Run home, all alone, blood on your face
Kiss your ego, you and me know that all you are is a fake, so
So take your ego, but not where we go
Take your ego, but not where we go
[Won't ever change
