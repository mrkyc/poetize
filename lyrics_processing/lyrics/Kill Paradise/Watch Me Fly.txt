When I was a kid crossed my legs and sit
Down to black and white, and I made music out of it
It was a special bond I had with every song
Blew my mind every time a new note came along
It was like colors that you couldn't describe
I fell in love with something and it wasn't alive
It took me away so I could never leave it behind

So I fly, fly right in to brighter days
So I decide to stay up in the sky
So watch me fly like years gone by
So I fly, fly right in to brighter days
So I decide to stay up in the sky
So watch me fly, so watch me fly

When I was a kid "Noize" in the basement
Decided I would pick it up and then I never quit
They said "Kid, you got it! Just keep reaching for the stars."
Said, "It wouldn't be easy that's why they gave you the job."
So take it slow and let it all sink in
We made mistakes, what were we thinking?
So take it slow and let it all sink in
The best memories, the ones we don't realize we're making

So I fly, fly right in to brighter days
So I decide to stay up in the sky
So watch me fly like years gone by
So I fly, fly right in to brighter days
So I decide to stay up in the sky
So watch me fly, so watch me fly

Take it slowly

So I fly, fly right in to brighter days
So I decide to stay up in the sky
So watch me fly like years gone by
So I fly, fly right in to brighter days
So I decide to stay up in the sky
