I'm so sorry for what you've been through
I know it's so hard for you
But you will always prevail
So it seems like we've been old and we've also been so young
I'm so astonished that you have come this far along
But all you need to do is pray
I swear one day
Everything will be ok
But all you have is me and I swear I got your back
And we'll always be together and we'll always be on track
I could swear to god I love you
Your killing me with tears
But you'll never be the same Jessie
And THAT'S soaring dear
Ok
Jessie I wish that
You will still a locket and ill put it in your pocket
Oh I'm sad today is our last day together
I will have to make the best of it
If I could wish upon a star I'd do it
But we blew it and were sad cause were doing it again
A swear to you I'd go die for you
Take a stab for you
And swing my blades for you
You might also likeBut all you have is me and I swear I got your back
And we'll always be together and we'll always be on track
I could swear to god I love you
Your killing me with tears
But you'll never be the same Jessie
And THAT'S soaring dear
Ok
Ohh Jessie I, I love you
Don't you remember when?
We went to your parents house to discuss with them
Where we had been that night and they were scared
They started to cry
But we just laughed and we said our last goodbye
But all you have is me and I swear I got your back
And we'll always be together and we'll always be on track
I could swear to god I love you
Your killing me with tears
But you'll never be the same Jessie
And THAT'S soaring dear
Ok
