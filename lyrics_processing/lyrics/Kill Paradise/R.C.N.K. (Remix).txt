I need somebody to help me to my feet
The dreams I'm having make me scared of the heat
But thanks to you I know it time I could be
Anything you told me that from day one
Said I could be the president so what the heck I'll go be one
You taught me to use manners and showed me the family tree
And now everyday I thank God for my family
I don't know where I'd be
It's so astonishing
Thank you Dad for working so hard so that I could be
Anything that I wanted to be and thank you Kimberly
For saying every single prayer that you said for me
So I just sit back and relax knowing that God has plan for me
And thank you family, thank you family
For sporting me in everything
I just don..t know where I..d be
Without your love, with out you mommy
And I know that may sound incredibly cheesy but who cares
This is for my family
I remember Mom when you took me to school
You drove the Jeep because I though it was cool
It was my first day of high school
And if it wasn't for you I'd swear I would look like a fool
You see that..s just the thing you would do anything
It doesn't matter about the pain you would do it for me
And now I'm older and my eyes are open wider you see
I swear to God ill never forget my family
And don't think I forgot about you, my Kimberly
I love you so much I cry just trying to sing
And I'd do anything to be as great a my Dad
Everybody come meet the best guy I..m sure glade I already have
