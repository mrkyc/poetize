Oh, memories are all that I see
Christmas Eve and toys that sing
It's so humbling remembering everything
But I cry all the time knowing that one day
Sun will fade away and all that's left to say
Is that I'm okay, so cherish it, just live
Live out these memories before they fade away
And it's the same who's to blame in this game
We have taken these pictures and that's our goal
I guarantee the photograph always means more
Always a mood to swing by take your medicine
The soccer team's way better than you think
Trust me I play on a forward position and stick by you
Ever notice anything
Especially when the mountains are closer than trust me than anything
But my imagination must be someone else's imagination of a paradise
Or a paradox, just trust me on this one, don't forget the homeless have families too
So lets run away with our memories, with our memories
Oh there's nothing to lose wising around
And so loose, there's so much to do
I love the air the summer leaves and bears
The memories I had and losing my hair
Even though it's there it's all the same
I love the memories so--
Scared of bees and aspen trees
Oh, memories are all that I see
Christmas Eve and toys that sing
It's so humbling remembering everything
But I cry all the time knowing that one day
Sun will fade away and all that's left to say
Is that I'm okay, so cherish it, just live
Live out these memories before they fade away
So lets run away with our memories, with our memories
Oh there's nothing to lose wising around
And so loose, there's so much to do
I love the air the summer leaves and bears
The memories I had and losing my hair
Even though it's there it's all the same
I love the memories so much
But it's so sad looking at ever picture that I've had
You know that it's sad but you do it anyway
Just bring the pain back to feeling sane
I feel so insane but I'm trying to remain
Close to my friends even though I've lost them
But I love them and I love you too
Oh, what is there left to do?
Run away with our memories, with our memories
Oh there's nothing to lose wising around
And so loose, there's so much to do
I love the air the summer leaves and bears
The memories I had and losing my hair
Even though it's there it's all the same
