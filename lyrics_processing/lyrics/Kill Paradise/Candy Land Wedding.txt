And it seems like we should know that this is wrong
And it seems like we should know that everything we had once is gone
This is your Mayflower, coming over spring shower
I'm gonna play 'til I bleed
And I can't dance with you tonight, I'm gonna make it right
It's silk done right, a black candy high
And I'm gonna make you fly tonight

And I found you in the ocean blue fake sky
Rosy colored bones poke through
And I can never write a lullaby for you, for you

Do it man, best you can
Driver is in the hippie van
Diamond's in my other hand
I can't believe it's happening
Who's my other sky?
Meet me 'cause I'm flyin' high
Jordan's silky dress-up tie
I can't believe it's happening
The stars are aligned
Makes you want to dine
Back up, 'cause I'm fine
And I can't believe it's happening
Golden color plates
Porcelain legs and fancy dates
Love me 'cause I know it's fate
I can't believe it's happening
You might also like
And I found you in the ocean blue fake sky
Rosy colored bones poke through
And I can never write a lullaby for you, for you

Do it man, best you can
Driver is in the hippie van
Diamond's in my other hand
I can't believe it's happening
Who's my other sky?
Meet me 'cause I'm flyin' high
Jordan's silky dress-up tie
I can't believe it's happening
The stars are aligned
Makes you want to dine
Back up, 'cause I'm fine
And I can't believe it's happening
Golden color plates
Porcelain legs and fancy dates
Love me 'cause I know it's fate
I can't believe it's happening

Do it man, best you can
Driver is in the hippie van
Diamond's in my other hand
I can't believe it's happening
Who's my other sky?
Meet me 'cause I'm flyin' high

I can't believe it's happening
The stars are aligned
Makes you want to dine
Back up, 'cause I'm fine
And I can't believe it's happening
Golden color plates
Porcelain legs and fancy dates
Love me 'cause I know it's fate
