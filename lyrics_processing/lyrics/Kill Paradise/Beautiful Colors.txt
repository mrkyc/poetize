That moment's gone, so I wrote you this song now
It feels like the road is telling me where to go now
There's nothing to fear, it's so special here
So I'll go pack my bags, take the train
Leave with nothing but my own hopes and dreams
That's everything to me
So what would it be like if everything came true
Imagine when I see you, imagine what I'd do
I'd gaze up at the stars and never move my eyes
Take me to a place high up in the skies
Imagine what I'd do if everything came true
I'd never have to fly in a rainy day
-?
I'll go pack my bags, take the train
Leave with nothing but my own hopes and dreams, that's me
I know it's true, but i gotta do what my heart's supposed to do
And what I was born to do
So what would it be like if everything came true
Imagine when I see you, imagine what I'd do
I'd gaze up at the stars and never move my eyes
Take me to a place high up in the skies
Imagine what I'd do if everything came true
I'd never have to fly in a rainy day

Leave with nothing but my own hopes and dreams, that's me
I know it's true, but i gotta do what my heart's supposed to do
And what I was born to do
Grab my hand now and feel my insides, this is where I should be
All that dreamin' and theres with reason, its extra-ordinary
I'll go pack my bags, take the train
Leave with nothing but my own hopes and dreams, that's me
I know it's true, but i gotta do what my heart's supposed to do
And what I was born to do
Grab my hand now and feel my insides, this is where I should be
All that dreamin' and theres with reason, its extra-ordinary

And I just need, need this moment
To watch the sky breathe the air
And I can see, see the ocean and your eyes standing there
