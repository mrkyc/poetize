It's summertime
Break it down
Heart attack
On the same path as a dart and tack
Hold you 'cause I need you there
Take it cause it's only fair
Whatcha wanna go for
Why'd you'd wanna do this
I hope that you are happy
You are only empty
Everything I do is empty without you
You're taking everything that seems so true

So how do you feel now, my love
You're always in every one of us
And nobody will ever shake the way you do
Your digits are candy sin to you
I'm letting you go just like the birds
I feel like I've emptied all your words
From singles takes
To mountaintops
Liquor cakes
To lemon drops
It's all for you, it's all for you
You might also like
Shake, shake
Shake it up
Shake it up
Go dip it in the water
And I hope you had enough
I see you're only instinct
You're only on the outside
Burning is my hobby
And dying is my pastime
You're recreated
So don't get motivated
Your changing is outdated
And you're just overrated
I'll keep you captivated
Just watch me
So truly underrated
Just touch me

So how do you feel now, my love
You're always in every one of us
And nobody will ever shake the way you do
Your digits are candy sin to you
I'm letting you go just like the birds
I feel like I've emptied all your words
From singles takes
To mountaintops
Liquor cakes
To lemon drops
It's all for you, it's all for you
Let's go!
You know you are the best (The best)
It's shaking inside your chest
Closure just outweighs the rest
So why?
Why is it I, will bury a tree
When you left without hope
And imprisoning me?
With everything that a teacher can see
Realize that hope that will bring you to me (To me, to me)
From trenches to glory (Glory)
Oh, baby that is the story (Story)
You know that this could get gory
Gory, it's only, you've got it, it's morning

So how do you feel now, my love
You're always in every one of us
And nobody will ever shake the way you do
Your digits are candy sin to you
I'm letting you go just like the birds
I feel like I've emptied all your words
From singles takes
To mountaintops
Liquor cakes
To lemon drops
It's all for you, it's all for you
So how do you feel now, my love
You're always in every one of us
And nobody will ever shake the way you do
Your digits are candy sin to you
I'm letting you go just like the birds
I feel like I've emptied all your words
From singles takes
To mountaintops
Liquor cakes
To lemon drops
