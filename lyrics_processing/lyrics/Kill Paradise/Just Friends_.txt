The girl they sing about on radio
She's got style she's got grace
I'm all over the place
I gotta tell her now
You know your boyfriend you can't do without
And if i ever see him Im gonna pop him in the mouth, *POW*
You know he lies, all he does it make you cry
Hanging with a different girl almost ever other night
Woahhh she's on the phone
And he's been screamin' at her all night long
It's time to hang it up and end it right
Come on its Friday night
You know you're better off on your own
She's screamin' WOAHH
She's dreamin' WOAHH
Dreamin' of her weekend
WOAHH, just sleeping, WOAHH
Hey there's this pretty pretty girl I know
He broke her heart and now shes letting go
What you two had was never love you know
So let me show you what it feels like
I'll never make you cry, always kiss you goodnight
Sunrise and summertime, finally have some fun tonight
I'm gonna make you forget, all the bad things he did
Baby baby we can do it right

Come on its Friday night
You know you're better off on your own
She's screamin' WOAH

He left her all alone
And he don't miss it either
She told me on the phone
The stuff that doesn't sink, she brings up
He left her all alone
Never thought that he would get caught
Never thought that he could get caught
Now it's time for all this to stop
Woahh we're at the show
And we've been hangin' out all night long
She ended it, she did it right
Come on it's Friday night, everybody's singin' along
(X4)
She's screamin' WOAH
She's dreamin' WOAH
Dreamin' of her weekend
