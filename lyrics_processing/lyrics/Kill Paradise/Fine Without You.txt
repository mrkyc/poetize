Captivated by my true life, I want you to feel
You apologize, put down your lies, and move your mouth so i sympathize
You turned your back and that was that, threw away what we could've had
Cause I'm fine with you
I just wanted to let you know
That you can't come and go when you leave me a note
You should've thought of that before like i said
I am fine with you
I just wanted to let you know
Because the world you know is so second grade it's typical: you come and go
You put my heart on a string around your neck
And wore it proud for all to see
I wish you were who you used to be
So i gotta be strong, gotta keep moving on
Got you singing my song; You're singing it all wrong and i'm laughing cause i'm so glad you said goodbye
Cause I'm fine with you
I just wanted to let you know
That you can't come and go when you leave me a note
You should've thought of that before like i said
You might also likeI am fine with you
I just wanted to let you know
Because the world you know is so second grade it's typical: you come and go
Your body of deception and lies, doing anything with anybody for braggin rights
When you sit down and cry you should think of how i...
I moved on, and i'm proving you wrong
The proof is in the lyrics so just listen to your song
I know you're alone, Dont call
Cause I'm fine with you
I just wanted to let you know
That you can't come and go when you leave me a note
You should've thought of that before like i said
I am fine with you
I just wanted to let you know
