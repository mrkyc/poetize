That think we wanna stay asleep
The girl I dreamt that she would be
Is standing right in front of me
Oh Lexi, you're just so sexy
Won't you take me, take me away
Oh baby, oh Lexi
You're just the way I wanted you
Oh Lexi, you're just so sexy
Won't you take me, take me away
Oh baby, oh Lexi
You're just the way I wanted you
It's you and me, carved into the tree
A special love like this for all to see
I smell the sunshine air, summer in her hair
Butterflies feel light in the air
And you are, you're something special
I drove too far to not be with you
And I drove too far, too far
I've got sweet kisses all for you

Together forever, I wrote you that letter
Sent pictures and post cards to make you feel better
My heart breaks from every state to state
I know we'll make it, just be patient
And you are, you're something special
I drove too far to not be with you
And I drove too far, too far
