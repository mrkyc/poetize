My eyes are cupid and they're cooking up a dream
I want to kiss you. Do I?
I want to seal the deal
Your something that I want to touch and feel
Chorus
Fall... Don't you really want to fall from a star?
You know that heaven is not that far from a star
I've bet you fallen deeper in the dark
Oh baby dream about it
Fall... Don't you really want to fall from a star?
You know that heaven is not that far from a star
I've bet you fallen deeper in the dark
Oh baby dream about it
You're something special, something that I've never seen
My eyes are cupid and they're cooking up a dream
I want to kiss you. Do I?
I want to seal the deal
Your something that I want to touch and feel
And I heard what you said
I got visions in my head
You make me suffer, watch the brake-down
I love it when you're red
I can see your inner prize
You seduce me with your eyes
I can feel it why dont we say it
Love is in the sky....
