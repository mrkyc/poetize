Is a special night for the both of us cause we..re getting close
Baby I could love you forever and baby I could love you..
Forever
And I won't ever let you go, when we drop
Cause I..m ..spittn and I love you and you..re hot
And I..ll never ever leave you
Cause I swear to God I love you
Katie and I are flies tonight
Don..t fly away don..t fly to high
I met a guy, he asked, how my day?
I said my day, my days was ok because
I saw Katie A and Katie B today
Working them high heels
And they working them scraped heels
Oh yeah!
Say, I don..t know what to do, with the both of you
Cause your looking so pretty tonight and baby baby I just might..
Take you for a ride tonight
Now come on girl it..s time to get crazy
I..m not the one who..s lazy baby
Look at you move your fancy feet
Dancing so proudly, man that..s my biggest fantasy
I love you just so much
Just the way you are and your special touch
Dancing around like you like to mush
It..s the mosh pit baby, I..m not trying to talk. Hush hush
Baby baby darling here is to me and you tonight
No ones watching me so get crazy
And time to get it right
Because I love you
And you know baby I love you
So its doesn..t matter if your scared of what your names is
You know you cannot dance
Get your pants on baby get that prance on
Everybody loves the way you get your dance on
I could love you if you shake your shoulders get your pants on baby
