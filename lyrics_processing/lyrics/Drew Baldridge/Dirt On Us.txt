Corn stalks stickin' out the grill
I still see that farmer's middle finger
We'd come rollin' through the center of town
Kicker subs kickin' and the glass-packs loud
Guilty as sin with mud drippin' off the fenders
Wild hair growin' long on us
You could hang a country song on us
Chasin' everything with a skirt on it
Me and the boys, me and the boys
Get stuck, we'd hook a chain on it
Fourth and goal, you ain't gonna score on us
Whole lotta washed in the blood on us
Me and the boys, we were noise
With dirt on us
We were two-lane reckless, and buckshot crazy
Some where ya goin' girl, hop in here baby
Raised up good, hell-bent on bein' bad
Kissed all the girls who loved that we had that
Wild hair growin' long on us
You could hang a country song on us
Chasin' everything with a skirt on it
Me and the boys, me and the boys
Get stuck, we'd hook a chain on it
Fourth and goal, you ain't gonna score on us
Whole lotta washed in the blood on us
Me and the boys, we were noise
With dirt on us
You might also likeWe slung a lotta gravel
Sprayed a lot of paint
Brothers with different last names
Wild hair growin' long on us
You could hang a country song on us
Chasin' everything with a skirt on it
Me and the boys, me and them boys
Get stuck, we'd hook a chain on it
Fourth and goal, no way you gonna score on us
Whole lotta washed in the blood on us
Me and the boys, we were noise
With dirt on us
Yeah the preacher had to work on us
Two-a-days put the hurt on us
When we're gone lay us down in that town
And throw some dirt on us
