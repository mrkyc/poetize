I was like a bullet straight out the gun
Never stuck around, always on the run
Never thought I'd find someone
That'd make me wanna stay like she does
No one ever liked me for me
Scared of this guitar, scared of these dreams
But nobody ever made me believe
The way that she does

Her smile puts the shine in my old truck
Her pretty heart breaks down my tough
One look, one kiss, yeah, I'm a goner
God musta spent a little more time on her
'Cause she got me fallen head over boots
Thinking crazy things like putting down roots
Hell of a view, front porch, white picket
She was the piece to the puzzle that I was missing
Ain't nobody ever gonna love me like she does

She got a little tattoo her mama can't see
"3:16" written in black ink
When I'm having trouble just trying to believe
There ain't no doubt that she does
Not everybody likes a two lane town
Sitting on a hood off an old rural route
Sipping homemade as the sun goes down
But I thank God that she does
You might also like
Her smile puts the shine in my old truck
Her pretty heart breaks down my tough
One look, one kiss, yeah, I'm a goner
God musta spent a little more time on her
'Cause she got me fallen head over boots
Thinking crazy things like putting down roots
Hell of a view, front porch, white picket
She was the piece to the puzzle that I was missing
Ain't nobody ever gonna love me like she does

Ooh, she does

Got tired of being a one man band
So I went out bought that piece of land
Sat out there and called her old man
And I said

Her smile puts the shine in my old truck
Her pretty heart breaks down my tough
One look, one kiss, yeah, I'm a goner
God musta spent a little more time on her
'Cause she got me fallen head over boots
Thinking crazy things like putting down roots
Hell of a view, front porch, white picket
She was the piece to the puzzle that I was missing
