Come on

Little bit of sun sinking down on an old green bin
Little bit of sweat on the brow, a whole lotta take it on the gin
A little bit of barbed wire, little pile of bonfire
A little corn growin' up in rose
Yeah, pray for what we got, we don't need a lot
'Cause little is all we know

A little bit of out there, little bit of nowhere, out where
Little bit goes a long way
A little bit of cold beer, little bit of John Deere, so gear
Hold it up a lot of bad homemade (Hey)
Hey girl, whatchu doin' tonight?
Turn to baby, whatchu doin' for the rest of your life?
That down home homegrown life ain't hard and miserable
Little small town, little's just a little bit better
Yeah, it is

A little bit of wide open peekin' through a screen door
Little hanks still comin' through the dash
Population reached 584
And every last one won't give their shirt off their back for
You might also like
A little bit of out there, little bit of nowhere, out where
Little bit goes a long way
A little bit of cold beer, little bit of John Deere, so gear
Hold it up a lot of bad homemade (Hey)
Hey girl, whatchu doin' tonight?
Turn to baby, whatchu doin' for the rest of your life?
That down home homegrown life ain't hard and miserable
Little small town, little's just a little bit better
Hey, woah

Little piece of land, little piece of mine
Little piece of Heaven, little piece of the pie
Little two lane, baby sittin' on my ride
That's for me and my damn right, we like

A little bit of out there, little bit of nowhere, out where
Little bit goes a long way
A little bit of cold beer, little bit of John Deere, so gear
Hold it up a lot of bad homemade (Hey)
Hey girl, whatchu doin' tonight?
Turn to baby, whatchu doin' for the rest of your life?
That down home homegrown life ain't hard and miserable
Little small town, little's just a little bit better
