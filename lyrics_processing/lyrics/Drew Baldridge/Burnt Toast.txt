She can drive a stick shift 4x4
Drink and leave the table leave you flat on the floor
If you want to keep your money buddy, don't take her on in pool
She can clean a creek with an old cane pole
Talk her way out of a ticket with a smile and a joke
But pots and pans ain't her forte
She can't boil water
But that's okay

She's wearin' nothin' but a Marshall Tucker shirt in the kitchen
Hair's all a mess but it don't need fixin'
Dancing and tappin' out a song with a spoon on the stove
Oh woah
Her long tan legs she knows that I'm looking
What she does to me, you can call it cooking
Winking and blowing a kiss through a cloud of smoke
Yeah, it might sound crazy, but my baby makes the best burnt toast

She's got a pistol 'cause a rifle won't fit in her purse
Gets me up early just to make me late for work
She's one of a kind
No cookie cutter
Yeah it melts my heart like it's a half a pad of butter

Her long tan legs she knows that I'm looking

Winking and blowing a kiss through a cloud of smoke
Yeah, it might sound crazy, but my baby makes the best
She's hotter than the burners burning up the bread
Yeah it might sound crazy but my baby makes the best
Burnt toast

The best burnt toast
Awe, you lookin' good, girl over there cooking that toast
