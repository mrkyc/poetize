I remember that first date, feeling like a king
Sitting out in my truck, freshmen wishing they were me
Old Kenny singing 'bout them boys of fall
Yeah this was our year, we were gonna win it all

It was skipping class, it was wasting gas
Always paying cash from mowing grass that hot last summer

We were living fast on top of the world
Trying to find a guy old enough
To buy a little cheap wine for you, girl
Game days, we were jerseys in the hall
Yeah barely eighteen but a bunch of know-it-alls
Oh blink an eye and then you're there
Oh on a gym floor in folding chairs
Yeah throwing caps up in the air
Couple tough boys shedding tears
Never thought it'd disappear
Senior year

Burning tires to burnt CDs
It was breaking curfew, Mama waiting on me
Thinking that first love would last forever
My old letter jacket and oh it'll never looked better
Than it did on her shoulders
Oh but now that we're older
I wonder where she is now
If she ever thinks about
You might also like
Living fast on top of the world
Trying to find a guy old enough
To buy a little cheap wine for you, girl
Game days, we were jerseys in the hall
Yeah barely eighteen but a bunch of know-it-alls
Oh blink an eye and then you're there
Oh on a gym floor in folding chairs
Yeah throwing caps up in the air
Couple loving birds shedding tears
Never thought it'd disappear
Senior year

Yeah every time I get to town
I take a lap around
And I can't help but smile
'Cause we were big shots for a little while
Senior year
Senior year

Yeah we were living fast on top of the world
Trying to find a guy old enough
To buy a little cheap wine for you, girl
Game days, we were jerseys in the hall
Yeah barely eighteen but a bunch of know-it-alls
Oh blink an eye and then you're there
On a gym floor in folded chairs
Yeah throwing caps up in the air
Couple tough boys shedding tears
Never thought it'd disappear
Senior year
Senior year
