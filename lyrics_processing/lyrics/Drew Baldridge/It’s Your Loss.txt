My love 
You're probably thinking my heart bust
I ain't getting no sleep
You probably coulda let me down a little softer
Instead of rubbing my name in the dirt
It's alright, I got a lot to offer
Yeah, I know my worth
It's your loss, not mine
It won't be long till I find
Someone I can take home to mama, don't bring no drama
Got a few more things that we got in common
Than you and I, soon you'll find
You said goodbye to a real good guy
It's your loss, not mine
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me calling
Your stopping by your house
Now hit the gym every single morning
So whenever you see me out
Gonna miss me, gonna wish we
Were leaving the bar together
Yeah you want my call, yeah you want my arms
But I know I can do better
You might also likeIt's your loss, not mine
It won't be long till I find
Someone I can take home to mama, don't bring no drama
Got a few more things that we got in common
Than you and I, soon you'll find
You said goodbye to a real good guy
It's your loss, not mine
Come on
You'll be missing my king-sized bed
You'll be missing my shoulder for your head
You'll be missing my little small town
When you try to come back around
Yeah, it's your loss, yeah it is
Yeah, it's your loss, baby
It won't be long till I find
Someone I can take home to mama, don't bring no drama
Got a few more things that we got in common
Than you and I, soon you'll find
You said goodbye to a real good guy
It's your loss, yeah it's your loss, not mine
Ooh baby, not mine
I think it's you that's hurting
See ya
Goodbye baby, it's your loss
