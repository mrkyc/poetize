I'ma tell you 'bout it right here, baby
Here we go

I'ma tell you what I've been thinking 'bout
Took a minute but I figured out
Life's better when you're around
That's the way I wanna keep it
I'ma feeling good 'bout where we're at
But if you wanna lay on the gas
We can get to forever fast
Girl, I can see it

I'ma build a house up on a hill
I'ma put your flowers on a windowsill
I'ma drive you wild, like I drive a tractor
I'ma rock you hard like a Telecaster
I'ma crazy for you, baby
I'ma tell you, girl
California, to Carolina
You ain't gonna find a country boy
Gonna love you more than I'ma
Yeah, baby
You might also like
I'ma let you smile then roll your eyes
But now you know what's on my mind
Looking at you, girl, I can tell
I'ma have to buy a hammer and a bunch of nails

'Cause I'ma build a house up on a hill
I'ma put your flowers on a windowsill
I'ma drive you wild, like I drive a tractor
I'ma rock you hard like a Telecaster
I'ma crazy for you, baby
I'ma tell you, girl
California, to Carolina
You ain't gonna find a country boy
Gonna love you more than I'ma

I'ma hold you close by the firelight
I'ma let you steal my shirt
I'ma thank the good Lord
When I find that little piece of outskirt dirt

Where I'ma build a house up on a hill
I'ma put your flowers on a windowsill
I'ma drive you wild, like I drive a tractor
I'ma rock you hard like a Telecaster
I'ma crazy for you, baby
I'ma tell you, girl
California, to Carolina
You ain't gonna find a country boy
Gonna love you more than I'ma
Maybe you ain't gon' find it?
Aw, hell no
Country boy gonna love you more than I'ma
Oh, yeah
California, to Carolina
You ain't gonna find a country boy
