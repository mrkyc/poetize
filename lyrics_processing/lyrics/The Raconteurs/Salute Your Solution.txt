Yeah
All right

I seem to think I think I got a little situation
So listen to me, sister, listen, maybe you can help
I think I give a lot of problems my consideration
But not for me, it always seem to be for someone else
Why all the people always seem to just be on vacation
What do I get from it? I don't get anything at all
I'm like a trash can holding all the information
And every single time it leave me feeling two feet tall
Salute your solution, now, salute your solution

I find myself just looking well beyond my best intentions
Ignoring any kinda prize I might receive at all
All others seem to find a road that's tough to satisfaction
I find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all
And if there's one little answer to this complication
Some wiser words to help me settle what is on my mind
There's no reward, I'm only taking, getting, and receiving
There's no reward, I'm taking
And no reward, I'm taking
You might also likeAnd no reward, I'm taking
And no reward, I'm taking
And no reward, I'm taking
No reward

And I got what I got all despite you
And I give what I get just to spite you
And I got what I got all despite you
And I give what I get just to spite you
And I got what I got all despite you
And I give what I get just to spite

I find myself just looking well beyond my best intentions
Ignoring any kinda prize I might receive at all
And all the others seem to find theyself the satisfaction
I find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all
But if there's one little answer to this complication
Some wiser words to help me settle what is on my mind
There's no reward, I'm only taking, getting, and receiving
There's no reward, I'm taking
And no reward, I'm taking
And no reward, I'm taking
And no reward, I'm taking
And no reward, I'm taking
