But me, I like to sit around and satisfy my soul
I like my women short, I like my women tall
And that's about the only thing I really dig at all
I belong to the beat generation
I don't let anything trouble my mind
I belong to the beat generation
And everything's goin' just fine
I was sayin' "let me out of here", before I was
Even born, it's such a gamble when you get a face
It's fascinatin' to observe what the mirror does
But when I dine it's for the wall that I set a place
I belong to the blank generation, and
I can take it or leave it each time, yeah
I belong to the... generation, but
I can take it or leave it each time
Triangles were fallin' out the window as the doctor cursed
He was a cartoon long forsaken by the public eye
The nurse adjusted her garters as I breathed my first
The doctor grabbed my throat, and yelled, "God's consolation prize!"
I belong to the blank generation, and
I can take it or leave it each time
I belong to the... generation, but
I can take it or leave it each time
You might also likeTo hold the T.V. to my lips, the air so packed with cash
Then carry it up flights of stairs and drop it in the vacant lot
To lose my trail of thought and fall into your arms' tracks
And watch beneath the eyelids through every passing dot
I belong to the blank generation, and
I can take it or leave it each time, yeah
I belong to the... generation, but
I can take it or leave it each time
Yeah, I belong to Generation X, man
I don't let anything trouble my mind
I belong to the me generation, and
Everything is gonna be just fine
I belong to generation Z
What's that you said?
What's that you're sayin' to me?
