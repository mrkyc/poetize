I've always been a dreamer
With my head in the clouds
Never one to choose my own way
I'm happy to follow the crowds

But something started and it won't go away
Stirring from deep inside
Something's changing, what it is I cannot say
I want to lead the way

Come crashing down
Like water, like rain
Something's started
I can feel again

Ain't no use in sitting around
Waiting for the world to change
Never too late to stand your ground
Do what it takes to make them proud
And never too late to change your mind
The book has not been written
The page is blank, the scene is set
Let's start at the beginning
You might also like
Now I know exactly where I stand
Open my heart, the future in my hands
How can it be that someone like me
Can be the voice, a face, a choice, a future generation

And there ain't no use in sitting around
Waiting for the world to change
Never too late to stand your ground
Do what it takes to make them proud
And never too late to change your mind
The book has not been written
The page is blank, the scene is set
Let's start at the beginning

I heard a voice
Calling in my head
Why wait until tomorrow?
The future stars today

Ain't no use in sitting around
Waiting for the world to change
Never too late to stand your ground
Do what it takes to make them proud
And never too late to change your mind
The book has not been written
The page is blank, the scene is set
Let's start at the beginning
And ain't no use in sitting around
Waiting for the world to change
Never too late to stand your ground
Do what it takes to make them proud
And never too late to change your mind
The book has not been written
The page is blank, the scene is set
Let's start at the beginning
And never too late to change your mind
The book has not been written
The page is blank, the scene is set
