You lit a candle in my heart
You said it'd never fade away
A little flicker at the start
Now a full blown flame

Every time I cry, every time I laugh
Always by my side through the good times or bad
Never thought that I would be the kind of girl
To give it all away
Give it all away

Full blown fire burning in my heart
I've got a little bit of what you are and
I've got the light, you've got the spark
We're home, we'll never be alone

You said you had to go away
And that the spark would never fade
There was so much left to say
This little candle burns away

Every time I smile, every time I frown
Always by my side through the up times or down
Never thought that I would be the kind of girl
To give it all away
Give it all away
You might also like
Full blown fire burning in my heart
I've got a little bit of what you are and
I've got the light, you've got the spark
We're home, we'll never be alone
Full blown fire burning in my heart
I've got a little bit of what you are and
I've got the light, you've got the spark
We're home, we'll never be alone

All the bad times fade to grey
There's nothing left for me to say
You give me hope
All the lights cut through the dark
You'll find your way back to my heart
And you'll be home

Full blown fire burning in my heart
I've got a little bit of what you are and
I've got the light, you've got the spark
We're home, we'll never be alone
Full blown fire burning in my heart
I've got a little bit of what you are and
I've got the light, you've got the spark
We're home, we'll never be alone
