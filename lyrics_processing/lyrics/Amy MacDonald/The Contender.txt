I've been written off so many times before
I've forgotten what it feels like to succeed anymore
Always on the sidelines, waiting in the wings
When the curtain finally calls, I'm never on the screen

And I've got the scars to prove I've been there
I've got the marks from when I tried
I've covered miles and miles to get here
Only for you to cast me aside

But I'll still run, run like the wind
And I'll still start, all over again
I gave it all, cause I had to make it
I gave it all, cause I had to try
Sacrificed my close relations
For the chance to say I tried

I've never learned to win, don't know what it means
I lost myself when we were young, I'm fighting just to feel
Always on the edge, I just want to make my name
I'd love to show the world what I gave up for the game

And I've got the scars to prove I've been there
I've got the marks from when I tried
I've covered miles and miles to get here
Only for you to cast me aside

But I'll still run, run like the wind
And I'll still start, all over again
I gave it all, cause I had to make it
I gave it all, cause I had to try
Sacrificed my close relations
For the chance to say I tried

And I've got the scars to prove I've been there
I've got the marks from when I tried
I've covered miles and miles to get here
Only for you to cast me aside
Oh, I've got the scars to prove I've been there
I've got the marks from when I tried
I've covered miles and miles to get here
Only for you to cast me aside

But I'll still run, run like the wind
And I'll still start, all over again
I gave it all, cause I had to make it
I gave it all, cause I had to try
Sacrificed my close relations
For the chance to say I tried
But I'll still run, run like the wind
And I'll still start, all over again
I gave it all, cause I had to make it
I gave it all, cause I had to try
Sacrificed my close relations
