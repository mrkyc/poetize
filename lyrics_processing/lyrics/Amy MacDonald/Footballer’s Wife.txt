Oh, Mr James Dean, he don't belong to anything
Oh, he left before they could get him
With their ways, their wicked ways
Oh, Marilyn Monroe, where did you go?
I didn't hear all your stories
I didn't see all your glory

But the footballer's wife tells her troubles and strife
I just don't care in the end, who is she to pretend
That she's one of them? I don't think so
And the girl from that show, yes the one we all know
She thinks she's some kinda star, yes, you know who you are
I don't think so, I don't think so

Oh, Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire
Won't you dance for me? Cause I just don't care
What's going on today I think there's something more
Something more
And I'm gone with the wind like they were before
But I'm believing myself, I think there's something more
There must be something more
I think there's something more, something more
You might also like
But still the footballer's wife tells her troubles and strife
I just don't care in the end, who is she to pretend
That she's one of them? I don't think so
And the girl from that show, yes the one we all know
She thinks she's some kinda star, yes, you know who you are
I don't think so, I don't think so

Oh, I don't believe in the telling of your stories
Throughout your life, there's just something unappealing
It don't catch my eye, it don't catch my eye
Oh, I don't believe in the selling of your glories
Before you leave this life, there's so much more to see
I don't believe this is how the world should be

But still the footballer's wife tells her troubles and strife
I just don't care in the end, who is she to pretend
That she's one of them? I don't think so
And the girl from that show, yes the one we all know
She thinks she's some kinda star, yes, you know who you are
I don't think so, I don't think so
The footballer's wife tells her troubles and strife
I just don't care in the end, who is she to pretend
