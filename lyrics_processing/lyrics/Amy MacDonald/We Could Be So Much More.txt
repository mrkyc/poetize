I need to find some air
Spend my days just living
Am I really there?
All the while you're running
You're roaming free
You're everything that I
Wish that I could be
How did you get to where you are inside?
How did it feel when you left the noise behind?
We could be so much more
We could be so much more
Will you save me? I've been holding on
Treading water since the day I was born
Will you teach me how to live again?
I lost it all inside my head
I lost it all in life and love my friend
Can we start again?
I've been living in limbo
Trying to face the world
Gotta keep my head down
No one needs to see this girl
Oh, there's always a mountain
That I have to climb
But I'm going in circles
Always seem to fall behind

We could be so much more
We could be so much more
Will you save me? I've been holding on
Treading water since the day I was born
Will you teach me how to live again?
I lost it all inside my head
I lost it all in life and love my friend
Can we start again?
Is this how it goes?
Are we cast aside
Like a falling leaf
Floating through the sky?
Can we try again?
We were more than friends
Way back then
We could be so much more
We could be so much more
Will you save me? I've been holding on
Treading water since the day I was born
Will you teach me how to live again?
I lost it all inside my head
I lost it all in life and love my friend
