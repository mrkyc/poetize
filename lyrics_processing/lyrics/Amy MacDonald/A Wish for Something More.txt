Oh, the sun is shinin' far too bright
For it to still be night
Oh, the air feels so cold, so cold and old
How can it be light?
Oh, let's take a walk outside
See the world through each other's eyes
I wish I was your only one
I think you're beautiful, but your hair is a mess
And your shoes are untied, but that's what I love best

And I, I wish I was the one
You lonely, lonely son
And you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingerin' glances
Fairytale romances every single day
And you look at me and say, "I'm your best friend every day"
But I wish for somethin', wish for somethin' more
Oh, I love you like a friend, but let's not pretend
How I wish for somethin', wish for somethin' more

Now the grass is so green
But I can't see anythin' past your eyes
I'm fixated on your smile
Your cherry lips make life worthwhile
I'm thinkin' these things, what I'm tryin' to say?
'Cause life gets in my way every single day
You might also like
And I, I wish I was the one
You lonely, lonely son
And you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingerin' glances
Fairytale romances every single day
And you look at me and say, "I'm your best friend every day"
But I wish for somethin', wish for somethin' more
Oh, I love you like a friend, but let's not pretend
How I wish for somethin', wish for somethin' more

Now the sun is fadin'
Now the rain is comin' down
And I'm looking at your face
When you're lookin' at the ground
I see diamonds in your dreams
I see pearls around your neck
I see everythin' that's beautiful
Oh, everythin' that's beautiful

And I, I wish I was the one
You lonely, lonely son
And you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingerin' glances
Fairytale romances every single day
And you look at me and say, "I'm your best friend every day"
But I wish for somethin', wish for somethin' more
Oh, I love you like a friend, but let's not pretend
