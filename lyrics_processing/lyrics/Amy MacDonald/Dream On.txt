Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Never gonna be on my own
It's clear as the day
Never gonna cast my anchor out
I'm a free spirit, torn in a way
I can't stay here for too long
I got to keep on moving on
Nothing fades as nothing changes
This old place is driving me crazy

Live on and dream on
I'm on top of the world and I'm on the right track
I'm on top of the world and I won't look back
Live on and dream on
I'm on top of the world and I'm on the right track
I'm on top of the world and I won't look back

I was living for the weekend
And the drinks are on me
Skipping school and cutting out
I wish this world would let me be
Trying to catch a feeling
Trying to find myself
We ran out into temptations
Cause this old place is driving me crazy
You might also like
Live on and dream on
I'm on top of the world and I'm on the right track
I'm on top of the world and I won't look back
Live on and dream on
I'm on top of the world and I'm on the right track
I'm on top of the world and I won't look back

I miss you when I'm gone
I'm still playing the same old songs
Dance like we used to do
But I'm better without you, better without you

Live on and dream on
I'm on top of the world and I'm on the right track
I'm on top of the world and I won't look back
Live on and dream on
I'm on top of the world and I'm on the right track
I'm on top of the world and I won't look back

The time is now, I cast my anchor down
I'm on top of the world and I'm on the right track
I'm on top of the world and I won't look back
The time is now, I cast my anchor down
I'm on top of the world and I'm on the right track
I'm on top of the world and I won't look back
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
