I see my demons at night
They whisper in my ear
They say, "Everything will be all right
Burn with me; don't you feel no fear!"

One shot to take away the sting
And I don't care about one damn thing
One shot may whatever bring
And I don't care about one damn thing

You know I come from dirt
You will remember me
By the blood, by the blood
By the blood on your shirt
You know I come from dirt
You will remember me
By the blood, by the blood
By the blood

I still see it every now and then
The ghost of forgotten faith
With too few fingers for these sins
I can still spell my goddamned name

One shot to take away the sting
And I don't care about one damn thing
One shot may whatever bring
And I don't care about one damn thing

You know I come from dirt
You will remember me
By the blood, by the blood
By the blood on your shirt
You know I come from dirt
You will remember me
By the blood, by the blood
By the blood


When I die
I'll die and have no regrets
When you die
You'll die and this world will forget
Yeah, yeah!

One shot to take away the sting
And I don't care about one damn thing
One shot may whatever bring
And I don't care about one damn thing
You know I come from dirt
You will remember me
By the blood, by the blood
By the blood on your shirt
You know I come from dirt
You will remember me
By the blood, by the blood
By the blood

You will remember
You will remember
You will remember me

By the blood
