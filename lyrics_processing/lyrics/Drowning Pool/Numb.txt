Numb! Numb!

To the man looking back at me
Said: "Why don't you go away?
We've all heard your misery
You've been bleeding it for days end"

It ain't hard when we look into your eyes, we see
All you want is everybody's sympathy

So why don't you take all of this and go away?
Why do you always look to me this way?
When it seems like tomorrow might not come
And it seems like the sorrow has left you numb

And to the world I see
Said: "We've sat and watched you shine
Pack up all your guilt and please
Leave it all behind"

And it's plain when I look into your eyes, I see
This could be the way you want your life to be

So why don't you take all of this and go away?
Why do you always look to me this way?
When it seems like tomorrow might not come
And it seems like the sorrow has left you numb

Numb! Left you so numb!
Numb! Has left you so numb!

Now you're gonna bleed
Said, now you're gonna bleed
Said, now you're gonna bleed
Said, bleed now for me
Now you're gonna bleed
Said, now you're gonna bleed
Said, now you're gonna bleed
Said, bleed now for me
Now you're gonna bleed!
(Bleed now for me)
Now you're gonna bleed!
(Bleed now for me)

Why don't you just tell me?
So why don't you take all of this and go away?
Why do you always look to me this way?
When it seems like tomorrow might not come
And it seems like the sorrow has left you numb

(And it seems like tomorrow) Numb
(It might not come) Numb
(And it seems like the sorrow) Left you numb
Now you're gonna bleed! Left you numb
