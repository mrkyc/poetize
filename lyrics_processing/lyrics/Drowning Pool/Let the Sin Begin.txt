Strapped in the mercy seat
In Kansas City
She's ringing hell's bells
From Seattle to Philly
Got an Indiana heart
With a Lone Star state of mind
Black Tooths any worries
Lines 'em up, knocks 'em all back

Well, the bad times ain't so mean
When she's sippin' gasoline
Raise 'em up, let's fire it up

Tonight is what we make it
You give it up, I'll take it
Girl, be my heroin
Now let the sin begin
Tonight is what we make it
You give it up, and I'll take it
Come be my heroin
Now, let the sin begin

Let the sin begin

She's down in NOLA
Voodoo City, U.S. of A
She's out in Vegas
Shaking sugar daddies in from LA
She's got her Southern ways
Dancing on her Northern views
She walks a fine line of East Coast 'tude
And West Coast laid-back

No, the bad times ain't so mean
When she's shootin' gasoline
Raise 'em up, let's fire it up

Tonight is what we make it
You give it up, I'll take it
Girl, be my heroin
Now let the sin begin
Tonight is what we make it
You give it up, and I'll take it
Come be my heroin
Now, let the sin begin

Let the sin begin
Let it in, let it in
She makes the hard times easy
She's my, she's my heroin


Tonight is what we make it
You give it up, I'll take it
Girl, be my heroin
Now let the sin begin
Tonight is what we make it
You give it up, and I'll take it
Girl, be my, come be my
You'll be my, hey! Hey!
Tonight is what we make it
You give it up, and I'll take it
Girl, be my heroin
Now let the sin begin
Tonight is what we make it
You give it up, and I'll take it
Come be my heroin
Now let the sin begin

Let the sin begin
Let it in, let it in
Let the sin begin
