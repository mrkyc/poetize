What ever happened to, "Till death do us part"?
"Together forever" slowly severed us apart
Ya know, dreams are just like lies
(Dreams are just like lies) When you walk away

And I never wanna feel again
As the blackness settles in
And I only have one thing left to say

You're the reason that I'm alive
(Reason that I'm alive)
You can twist that knife, but I just won't die
You're the reason that I'm alive
(Reason that I'm alive)
To leave you here, as you watch me fly away
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
As you watch me fly away
Watch me fly away

What ever happened to the lies that I believed?
And wasn't it you that said, "The truth will set us free"?
Ya know, dreams are just like lies
(Dreams are just like lies) When you walk away

And we never even had a chance
As the sadness slips away
And I only have one thing left to say

You're the reason that I'm alive
(Reason that I'm alive)
You can twist that knife, but I just won't die
You're the reason that I'm alive
(Reason that I'm alive)
To leave you here, as you watch me fly away
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
As you watch me fly away
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
As you watch me fly away

I... I'm rising up on broken wings
I... And I'm choking back these empty sins
I... Well, I hope you take this
Take this as you walk away

You're the reason that I'm alive
You can twist that knife, but I just won't die
You're the reason that I'm alive
To leave you here, as you watch me fly away
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
As you watch me fly away
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
As you watch me fly away
Watch me fly
Watch me fly
Watch me fly away
Watch me fly
Watch me fly
Watch me fly away
Watch me fly
Watch me fly
