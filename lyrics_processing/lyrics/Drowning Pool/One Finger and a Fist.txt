I'll claw my way out of any situation
I got a one-two punch
I'll fight my way out of any confrontation

I got news for you:
You're not the first one
Won't be the last
Won't take abuse
I see you run, son
You're running fast
What you wanna do?

You know the truth:
You go against me
You're gonna lose

Play your hand without a deck
You make your bed of nails

I'll claw my way out of any situation
I got a one-two punch
I'll fight my way out of any confrontation
