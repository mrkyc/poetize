Although it's never enough to make me horrified
Every time I tear off my mask, you run away* (x3)
Don't talk to me
Every time I tear off my mask, you run away* (x3)
Don't talk to me
...Talk to me
Every time I turn around it's somethin' else
I can't save you because
I cannot save myself, yeah
All the bruises and cuts, acquired from the past
Oh, it's so much luck, we're never meant to last
Every time I tear off my mask, you run away* (x3)
Don't talk to me
Every time I tear off my mask, you run away* (x3)
Don't talk to me
I don't know if I can save myself from this
Every time I turn around, I feel like shit, yeah
Help me (x6)

Every time I look around it's somethin' new
I thought we'd make it
But I guess, I thought it was you
I reach out for a thing I was never meant to have
Sometimes, so sick I just have to cry and laugh
How can I be so sick, you said you did not love?
Why don't you get out of this
And come away so strong?
Every time I tear off my mask, you run away* (x3)
Don't talk to me
Every time I tear off my mask, you run away* (x3)
Don't talk to me
I don't know myself, I wish you'd help me along
Sometimes I feel so weak
And why are you so strong?
Help this, hate this, need this, want this
Come, (x3)
Ooh-oooh (x2)
I can't save myself
Because I can't see, just what's goin' on
Or what is wrong with me
Maybe I'm just like you
Yeah!
