Where was God
When I needed a friend?
And where was God
When I came to an end?
Where was God
When I lost my mind?
Where was God
When I couldn't find?

I don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down

Where was love
When I felt like hate?
Where was hate
When I felt like love?
Where were you
When you said you'd be there?
Where was the fear
When I said I was scared?
