I got two bloody knees
And a brand-new scar
So, come along, son
And ask me just how far
I took it the first time
(First time) This time
There won't be a next time

What kind of friend
Would bite my hand
If I stuck it out
Like I gave a goddamn?
My eyes are open wide, and I
And I hate what I found, yeah

The love, the hate, regret
We all have it (Hey! Hey!)
We all have it (Hey! Hey!)
Yeah!
The love, the hate, regret
We all have it

Raise your hands if you feel like I do
Scream aloud if you feel like I do
Bring the hell if you feel like I do
Like you do, like we all do

I'd climb up sixteen chapels
And kick out every sixteenth stone
To keep another one
From feeling so broken
To keep another one
From feeling so torn

Ain't got a friend
Wouldn't bite my hand
If I stuck it out
Like I gave a goddamn
I taste of jaded tongue, and I
And I've grown to like it, yeah!

The love, the hate, regret
We all have it (Hey! Hey!)
We all have it (Hey! Hey!)
Yeah!
The love, the hate, regret

Feel like you do, like we all do

Raise your hands, bring the hell
