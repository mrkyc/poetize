Jesus and the devil had an awful battle
The greatest fight in history, there can be no doubt
The first time of the battle was in Bethlehem
The devil got in trouble as he tackled him
Who sacrificed for the word he'd know
But Satan promised Jesus he would take him home
But Jesus told the tempter they were not his kind
You go below the devil just to get behind

Don't tell me how to live
Cover your own ass and hide your kids

Yeah, stop, drop, down on all fours
And touch your tongue to the floor
Stop, drop, down on all fours
Oh, my Lord, oh, my Lord!

We are the devil, devil, devil
We are the devil, and life is hell
We are the devil, devil, devil
We are the devil, and life is hell

We are the devil, devil, devil

We are the devil, devil, devil
We are the devil, and life is hell
