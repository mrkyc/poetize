Huah!
Yeah!

Bury the priest and burn religion alive
Baptize at birth with the black brush's wine
The uncrowned king unholy
Forget about the crucifix
My rising sign is 666

Can't you see the way they twist and turn?
You watch it burn
Just sign right here and watch the tables turn
You want the world
I'll show the way
Just raise your fist and let me hear you say

"Hate," you want it
Say, "Hate," you need it
Say, "Hate," you want it
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Get it, get it, go
Get it, get it, go

Incarnation can bring down the stars
Five thousand times, and their service is ours
Obscene, unclean, unholy
The losers, dope fiends, and don't forget
The worthless, no-good, piece of shit

Come with me and we'll drink a toast to anarchy
All we need is excess and ecstasy
You want the world
I know the way
Just raise your fist and let me hear you say

"Hate," you want it
Say, "Hate," you need it
Say, "Hate," you want it
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Get it, get it
"Hate," you want it
Say, "Hate," you need it
Say, "Hate," you want it
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Get it, get it, go
You know we're still alive
The words you bleed and live through
Wither on the vine
And though it's plain to see
In our society
All of us will bleed
But your war is not with me
There are many of those who oppose us
There are many of those who oppose us
There are many of those who oppose us
Who oppose us, who oppose us

All of this could always be
The way that you would want it to
Come on and sell your soul
It's what you want to do
This could be the only way
Forget about Judgment Day
Ignorance is bliss, so raise your fist and say

"Hate," you want it
Say, "Hate," you need it
Say, "Hate," you want it
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Get it, get it
Hate, you want it
Say, "Hate," you need it
Say, "Hate," you want it
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Get it, get it, go
Get it, get it, go
Get it, get it, go
Yeah, come on, come on, come on, come on
