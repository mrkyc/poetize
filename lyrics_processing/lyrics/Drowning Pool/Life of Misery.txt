All your life, things were handed to you
On a silver platter with a golden spoon
And you only do just enough to get by
You never had to work a hard day in your life

You think you're better than me, better than me
You better change your fucked-up attitude
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Like you expect some sort of gratitude

You keep on fooling yourself
You're full of yourself

I could, I could never lead
Lead a life of misery like you live it
I would, I would rather die
Than live a life of misery with you in it

(Look) Look at you now:
(What) What a waste now
(Live) Your life of misery
(Look) Look at you now:
(What) What a joke now
(Live) Your life of misery

All you ever do is bitch and complain
About the small things; man, it drives me insane

You think you're better than me, better than me
You better change your fucked-up attitude

(Look) Look at you now:
(What) What a joke now

Tell your lie after lie after lie
If it makes you feel that much better
(Look) Look at you now:
(What) What a joke now
(Live) Your life of misery

Look at you
What a shame...
All alone now
What a waste


Fuck me?
Well, fuck you, too!

I could, I could never lead
