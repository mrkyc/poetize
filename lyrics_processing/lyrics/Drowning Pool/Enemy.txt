The words you use were mine
Used a thousand times
Doesn't make them what I bled
I hated you... I loathed you
Though felt, I never let the words begin to spill

Make me sick till I can't breathe
Never want to be your enemy
Silence me so I can't be
Never wanted to be your enemy

I walked the high road away from you
God knows what I've been through
This is the life I have
This is the life I choose
I walked away... The high road away from you
Walk away, walk away
You made an enemy

I never... I never wanted
I never wanted to poison or burn through
Labeled "malcontent," by bastards of descent
Excuse this place I stand; words of truth elude you

I walked the high road away from you
God knows what I've been through
This is the life I have
This is the life I choose
I walked away... The high road away from you
Walk away, walk away
You made an enemy

Deep inside, realize never wanna be your enemy
Change me, rearrange me, make me your enemy
(Yeah!)
Deep inside, realize never wanna be your enemy
(Walk away from)
Change me, rearrange me, make me your enemy
(Enemy, yeah)
Deep inside, realize never wanna be your enemy
