Let me live, let me live
Let me live with a fuck to give

If I suffocate
One more day in ritual lethargy
Well, there ain't no thing
Like habitual suicide in effigy

But I walk to cut, to break away
The prideful leash
And this spiteful tethering
Don't push me

I wanna die
Stop pulling at me
I wanna die with some peace of mind
Live, let me live
Stop pulling at me
Let me live with a fuck to give
Push

If I eat the lies one more time
I'll choke to death on my pride
I can't push aside all the broken bones
You're calling a spine

I walk to cut, to break away
The prideful leash
And this spiteful tethering
Don't push me

I wanna die
Stop pulling at me
I wanna die with some peace of mind
Live, let me live
Stop pulling at me
Let me live with a fuck to give
I wanna die
Stop pulling at me
I wanna die with some peace of mind
Live, let me live
Stop pulling at me
Let me live with a fuck to give

Where do we go
When all the best years of our lives
Are passing by faster
Than we can blink our eyes?
They say that life's a bitch
Well, I've got a bone to pick
I said, "I told her, 'Bend over
And I'll fuck, I'll fuck, I'll fuck the world'"
I wanna die
Stop pulling at me
I wanna die with some peace of mind
Live, let me live
Stop pulling at me
Let me live with a fuck to give
I wanna die
Stop pulling at me
I wanna die with some peace of mind
Live, let me live
Stop pulling at me
Let me live with a fuck to give

Push
Stop pulling at me
Let me live with a fuck to give
Push
Stop pulling at me
