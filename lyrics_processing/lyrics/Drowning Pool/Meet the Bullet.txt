If you're crazy and you know it, shoot yourself
If you're crazy and you know it, shoot yourself
If you're crazy and you know it
And the gun is cocked and loaded
If you're crazy and you know it, shoot yourself

Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet
Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway
Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet
Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway

Fuck you! 'Cause if you had your way
You'd have me broken and exposed
And subject to ridicule, maneuvered and pitiful
But, but I know, I know, I know

Hide your blades under your tongue
Now you will feel what I say
I will always hold the gun
And blow this all away

You need (Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
The bullet (Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
You need (Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
The bullet (Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)

My patience is worth more than your whim
Your ignorance rips me limb from limb
The skin is too thin to stretch
And cover up the bones left to pick

Hide your blades under your tongue
Now you will feel what I say
I will always hold the gun
And blow this all away

Away

Death is the new love and dust is the new blood
Death is the new love and dust is the new blood
Death is the new love and dust is the new blood
Death is the new love and dust is the new blood

You need the bullet

Hide your blades under your tongue
Now you will feel what I say
I will always hold the gun
And blow this all away
Hide your blades under your tongue
Now you will feel what I say
I will always hold the gun
And blow this all away

You need (Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
The bullet (Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
You need (Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet, meet the bullet)
The bullet (Gone to meet the bullet, meet the bullet halfway)
