Do you see me sittin' here?
Waitin' for you to say anything
Head hung low, kickin' stones down
Kickin' stones down the road to hell now
I'm waitin' for you to say anything
Oh, anything, yeah

I know you are the only one
A little taste of heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell
Your eyes scream, "The end is creeping in
I'll need 37 stitches to keep the pain in"
And I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun
On the darkest side of the sun
Ooh, yeah

Followed the piper's sweet whistlin'
Guided down the path by the wrong hand
Closed my eyes for the chance of a better view
Closed my ears so I couldn't hear you

And I know you are the one
You know I am the one
Your bitter taste of hell

I know you are the only one
A little taste of heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell
Your eyes scream, "The end is creeping in
I'll need 37 stitches to keep the pain in"
And I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun

Do you see me sittin' here?
Still waitin' for you to say anything
Head hung low, kickin' stones down
Kickin' stones down the road to hell now
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you
Just say anything, yeah

I know you are the only one
A little taste of heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell
Your eyes scream, "The end is creeping in
I'll need 37 stitches, 37 stitches," yeah
And I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun
I know, I know
On the darkest side of the sun
