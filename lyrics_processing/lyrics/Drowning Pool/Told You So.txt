Stretch

It took some time to realize
The bullshit in my eyes
Until I got away from you
And then I guess you thought that you'd be cool
And make me look like I'm the one, the fool
But I don't care, 'cause you're the one to blame

I can't believe it all comes down to this
A penny for your thoughts would make me sick
Anything less would be a crime

Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up

Everything is not okay
Tomorrow's another day
I'll find my perfect way out
And then I guess you thought that you'd be smooth
And make me look like I'm another fool
Well, I don't care, 'cause I don't believe anything you say or do

I can't believe it all comes down to this
A penny for your thoughts would make me sick
Anything less would be a crime

Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up

Now...
Just like this!

I cut my losses to save face
I've found my perfect space
I crawl back inside of myself
And then I guess you tried to make me be
Everything you wanted me to be
Well, look up from the ground and see who's laughing last

I can't believe it all comes down to this
A penny for your thoughts would make me sick
Anything less would be a crime

I do what it takes to pull me through
No thanks to anything that you could do
I'll never trust again

Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up
