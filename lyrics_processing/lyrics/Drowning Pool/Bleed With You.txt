I will bleed

You were the fire that burned it down
You never ran; you stood your ground
You used your voice to make your sound
(Woah, woah)
You learned to rise above the ash
You learned to fight and make your stand
You gave it all, never held back
(Woah, woah)

Here's to the ones we left behind
To the ones who never hide
To the ones broken inside
I will bleed with you
To the ones that make it right
To the ones who keep the fight
To the ones who don't lose sight
I will bleed with you

I will bleed with you
I will bleed

Sometimes, I know it's hard to fight
Through darkness, memories lose sight
Hold on to pride, yeah, hold it tight
(Woah, woah)
Between horizons, you are there
Even though, sometimes, life's unclear
Let's throw our fists into the air

Here's to the ones we left behind
To the ones who never hide
To the ones broken inside
I will bleed with you
To the ones that make it right
To the ones who keep the fight
To the ones who don't lose sight
I will bleed with you

We are the ones with our voices high
Screaming, "Don't lose hope!"
We're not afraid to die
We are the ones living out our lives
Screaming, "Don't lose hope!"
We're not afraid to die
Here's to the ones we left behind
To the ones who never hide
To the ones broken inside
I will bleed with you
To the ones that make it right
To the ones who keep the fight
To the ones who don't lose sight
I will bleed with you

You were the fire that burned in town
You never ran; you stood your ground
You used your voice to make your sound
(Woah, woah)
You learned to rise above the ash
You learned to fight and make your stand
You gave it all, never held back
I will bleed with you
I will bleed with you
