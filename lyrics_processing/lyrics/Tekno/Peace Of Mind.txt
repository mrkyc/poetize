I dey hear plenty scores (Yeah)
Say they no, believe us (Yeah)
But na God dey bless us (But na God dey bless us)
Their mouth is sharp like scissor
Say they try their best to dey pressure me
But I live my life, I send nobody, I live my life 'cause

Peace of mind is so underrated o
That's why I', patient o
'Cause I know my time is now
Make nobody whine me o
Peace of mind is so underrated o
That's why I'm patient o
'Cause I know my time is now
Make nobody whine me o at all

Suffer no good
Everyday I'm up to something
So far so good
I'm up and grateful
I remember I was wanting
When guys were flaunting
I see something
That's why I dey go
Get code
My story na, na glory
Big Molly, shift for me
Victoria, e don do me
That's why I dey go go go go
Anytime I show, no apology
Omoge 'cause I know that
