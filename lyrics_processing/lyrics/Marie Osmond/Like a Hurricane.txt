They want to know what you do to make me so crazy
'Cause lately, they see how I've turned around
My feet never touch the ground since you've been near me
They're asking "Is the boy really that hot?"
I tell them yes you are
"Can you tell us what the boy's got?"
Well, that's kind of hard
You see, it's not that easy
I know they wouldn't believe me....
'Cause you love me like a hurricane
You move me like a drivin' rain
Strike like lightnin' out of the blue
You rock me like an earthquake
You roll me like a tidal wave
Nothin's ever been the same after lovin' you
After lovin' you.......
But baby, they didn't believe a word
They said that they've never heard of a boy like that
That maybe I was stretchin' out the truth
Tryin' to take them for a fool with a story like that
They kept asking "Is the boy really that hot?"
I tell them yes you are
"Can you tell us what the boy's got?"
Well, that's kind of hard
You see, it's not that easy
I know they wouldn't believe me....
