Standin' on the corner
Dancin' in the rain
I knew that you were trouble
But I had ta know your name
Oh I shoulda felt the warnin'
I shoulda seen the signs
Cuz by the light o' the mornin'
I knew that you turned my water into wine
(Oh-oh-oh-o-oh) this love is twisted...
(Oh-oh-oh-o-oh), I couldn't resist it
I (still got a thing for you)
I can't deny it, honey it's true
I (still got a thing for you)
I know it's wrong but I'
Still got a thing for you yeah
Livin' in the fast lane
Heart was on a thread
Final destination
Love over the edge
Aw ya rocked me an' ya rolled me
'Til I had ta break away
But I remember your touch, just a little too much
Some things just never fade away
