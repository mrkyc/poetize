Why my heart explodes on a sunny mornin'
I wanna know why it feels so good with you
Huh-huh
I wanna know why the birds above
Start singing when we're making love
I wanna know how much is enough
When enough is never enough
I wanna know how God made the trees
Why it feels so fine in a summer breeze
I want the answers to all of these and more
Why it's you that I adore
I wanna know who said boys don't cry
And how aeroplanes stay in the sky
Why it feels so bad when you know your friend is, telling a lie
And why don't people follow good advice
And why does my dog think that I'm so nice
Why is everybody trying to get a little spice in life
When it's already quite alright
Isn't anybody satisfied?
And they think I'm the foolish one
And they think I'm the foolish one
But as sure as I'm new
And I question what's true
But I know how I feel about you
They think I'm the foolish one
You might also likeI wanna know why blue's the colour of feeling down
And how money makes the world go round
A million things like these and more I've found that
Just don't make sense
How did Leonardo DaVinci get to be so smart
How the Rolling Stones get older but they don't fall apart
Why people care more about TV stars than Mozart
I guess classics only get a guy so far
Tell me is that really who we are?
And they think I'm the foolish one
And they think I'm the foolish one
But as sure as I'm new
And I question what's true
But I know how I feel about you
They think I'm the foolish one
