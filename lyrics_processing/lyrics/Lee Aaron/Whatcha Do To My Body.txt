Animal, ooh, you're dangerous
Tiger's on the run
Better get out the gun
Could be trouble
Got me chained, got me tied
One look, I was hypnotised
Fever's running hot
Better get me a shot
On the double
Feel the intensity
Look what you do to me
I'm burning up, can't you see
Whatcha do to my body, body
You got me shakin', you make me weak
Whatcha do to my body, baby
Should be illegal, 'cause nobody should feel this good, no, no
You're a killer, you're a thief
Criminal, but you're running free
Stealing a glance
A little mid-day romance
You're in action
You might also likeI can't eat, I can't sleep
My obsession, you're my fantasy
Desperate for your touch
I can't get enough
Satisfaction
Feel the intensity (whoa)
Look what you do to me (whoa)
I'm burning up, can't you see
Whatcha do to my body, body
You got me shakin', you make me weak
Whatcha do to my body, baby
I'm all in pieces, I'm in too deep
Whatcha do to my body, body
When I'm defenceless, it's such a crime
Whatcha do to my body, baby
Should be illegal, 'cause nobody should feel this good
(Whatcha do, whatcha do) To my body
(Whatcha do, whatcha do)
Oh, make me feel good, good
(Whoa) I'm burnin' up
(Whoh) I'm breakin' up
(I'm burnin' up) Can't you see
Whatcha do to my body, body
You got me shakin', you make me weak
Whatcha do to my body, baby
I'm all in pieces, I'm in too deep
Whatcha do to my body, body
When I'm defenceless, it's such a crime
Whatcha do to my body, baby
Should be illegal, 'cause nobody should feel this good, no, no
(Whatcha do to my body body)
Oh whatcha do to my body body body body baby
(Whatcha do to my body, baby)
Feels so good
Make me feel good
(Whatcha do to my body, body)
You got me shakin'
Oh, it's such a crime, yeah
(Whatcha do to my body, baby)
