From a lost and lonely dream...
There was a lady with long dark hair
He doesn't know quite what it means
She was alluring, but so disturbing
He begins to quiver
Was like he knew her, like he'd been through her
Oh never never never..
Ooh, she sets his heart on fire..
Now this woman, that he desires..
After a long day
He finally falls asleep...
There was a lady with stone grey eyes
Into his dreams she starts to creep
Tossing an' turning, he feels a yearning
He begins to quiver..
He wants to touch her, he wants so much of her
Forever...
Ooh, she sets his heart on fire...
Now this woman, that he desires..
(She's the lady of the darkest night) darkes' night
(She'll take yer soul when the time is right)
(She's the lady of the darkest night) darkes' night
(She'll take your soul when the time is right)

On a Sunday afternoon..
Oh suddenly the air turns cold
Oh yes he knows she's coming soon
He cannot see her, but he can feel her
He begins to quiver
A strange sensation, like detonation
Oh... yeah
Ooh, she sets his heart on fire...
Now this woman, that he desires..
