By the little things you say...
Infatuated
By your way of passion play...
Hear the thunder, in my heart
Feel my emotions, comin' apart
Physical power, in your words
Something electric, like I've never heard...
Don't keep me waitin' anymore
Break the silence..
Don't keep me waitin' anymore

(Sweet.. talk...)
Gimme some o' that sweet talk
Whisper in my ear

Gimme some o' that sweet talk
It's what I wanna hear
(I need your sweet talk...)
All I need is your sweet talk
