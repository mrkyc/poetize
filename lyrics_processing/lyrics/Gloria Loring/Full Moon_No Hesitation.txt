When he got down on his knees
When he touched her
He didn't have to ask her
She laid back and urged him, "Please."
And he worked slow
Like a bridegroom with a virgin
She was begging when he bit her
When she gave in
What she gave up didn't matter
She was all his when it hit her
Full moon, no hesitation
It was much more than a whim
Full moon, no hesitation
When she gave herself to him
Oh, his blue eyes watched with every kind of wonder
While she let down her hair
Like the gold light when the sun is on the river
Like the answer to his prayer
She had white skin like his mother's favorite lilies
And she opened like a bud
When she kissed him
She stung him so completely
That he barely missed the blood
You might also likeFull moon, no hesitation
He had never been so sure
Full moon, no hesitation
When he gave himself to her
He had deep eyes
Deeper than the ocean off the coast of paradise
I was breathless when he talked about forever
I didn't think about it twice
When he took me
I gave him all he wanted
I surrendered to the feeling
He was hungry
It was more than just survival
When I filled his holy need
You might choose to call it superstition
You might think we're victims of the night
But here we are with your full permission
Both of us will wet our appetite
Now you're trembling
And  I know what you have needed
And I've tasted what you'll give me
And in moments I'll be more than only hopeful
I'll go down and take you with me
In a instant you be timeless as the winter
You'll be endless as the rain
Just a drop now
And you'll know a thousand lifetimes
And you'll thank me for the pain
Full moon, no hesitation
I'll be yours eternally
Full moon, no hesitation
You'll be young and strong and free
No hesitation
You'll be mine gratefully
Full moon
When you give yourself
When you give yourself to me
