I can be cold
You been believing just what your told
I seem to blame all failures on you
You do the best you can do
Don't let me change the way you are
'Cause you're already right with me
Don't let me change the way you are
'Cause I have a tendency
To try to make you more
Like what I ought to be
So, darling
If I should tear you up
Don't you listen
If I should break you down
Don't turn away
I'll end up missin' you so
I just want to let you know
Don't let me change the way you are
Don't let me change the way you are
You are the shoulder
I lean my darkest nights on
You pay the price for my peace of mind
I take out all my frustrations on you
You're doing the best you can do
You might also likeDon't let me change the way you are
'Cause you're already right with me
Don't let me change the way you are
Cause i have a tendency
To try to make you more
Like what I ought to be
So darling
If I should tear you up
Don't you listen
If I should break you down
Don't turn away
I'll end up missing you so
I just want to let you know
Don't let me change the way you are
Don't let me change the way you are
'Cause I have a tendency
To try to make you more
Like what I ought to be
So darling
If I should tear you up
Don't you listen
If I should break you down
Don't turn away
I'll end up missing you so
I just want to let you know
Don't let me change the way you are
Don't let me change the way you are
