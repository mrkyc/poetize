It shouldn't happen to you what happened Donnie?
Now I know things in the world lookin' crazy right now
But you don't know what's gonna happen next
But there's a word of encouragement for you, boy
Uncle Donnie, sing
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Some day yes, we'll put it together and we'll get it all down
Some day, when the world is much brighter
Some day yes, we'll walk in the rays of the beautiful sun
Some day when the world is much brighter
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Just you wait and see, things will get brighter
Oh, my baby boy, things are gonna get easier
Baby girl, things will get brighter
Some day yes, we'll put it together and we'll get it all down
Some day, when the world is much brighter
Some day yes, we'll walk in the rays of the beautiful sun
Some day when the world is much brighter
