Come as you are, bring every burden
Come as you are, bring all your shame
Come as you are, I know you hurting
But when you call upon His name
And surrender, surrender
You never be the same

Come as you are, hosah hosah
Come as you are, hosah hosah

Come as you are, all who are broken
Come as you are, and find His grace
Come as you are, His arms are open
Let go and let God just have His way
And surrender, surrender
And you never be the same

Come as you are, your past is over
Come as you are, break every chain
Come as you are, He holds your future
All things are new, this is the day
To surrender, to surrender ooh
Never be the same
Never be the same
You might also like
Come as you are, where you not forsaken
You can return (yes you can), if you have strength
Come as you are, all is forgiven
No need to hurt anymore, no need to wait
And surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender
You never be the same
Ohh hosah
Never be the same
Never, Never let go

It doesn't matter where you've been, doesn't matter
The colour of your skin, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter where you from, I surrender
You can come as you are
All the things from your past (doesn't matter)
Can't last anymore (doesn't matter)
Give it all up right now (surrender)
Come as you are
Surrender your life, surrender your heart
Give it to Jesus, (Surrender)
Give it to Him, give Him your heart
Your yesterday, your guilt and shame, let it all go, go now
Surrender, lift your hand high, surrender
Surrender, come as you are
You can depend on Him, c'mon surrender
Come as you are, and surrender
Oh Jesus I surrender all, to Him I freely give
Just surrender, just surrender
You never have to be the same again, you never have to be the same again
Surrender
You can come as you are, come as you are
Come as you are, you never be the same

Come as you are, hosah hosah
Come as you are, never be the same
Come as you are, come as you are
Come as you are, come as you are
Come as you are, Come as you are
