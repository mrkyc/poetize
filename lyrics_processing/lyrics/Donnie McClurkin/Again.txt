Oh oh, once again yeah, once again

Again I call you and again You answer
Again I need you and again You're there
Again I reach out and again You hold me
You console me once more, and

When I needed company, someone just to sit with me
When I need a helping hand, someone to understand me, yes
When I need someone who cares, someone to wipe away my tears
Reach out and calm my fears, I know that You'll be there, oh

Again I call you and again You answer
Again I need you and again You're there
Again I reach out and again you hold me
You console me once more, and again

Every time I turn around, the most amazing thing I've found
You're there to pick me up each time when I fall down (We fall down)
You never seem to mind and You're always treating me so kind
Time after every time, You've proven once again
You might also like
Again I call You and again You answer
Again I need You and again You're there
Again I reach out and again You hold me
You console me once more, and again, and again

And again, you will come through once again
Again I call you and again You answer
Again I need you and again You're there
Again I reach out and again You hold me
You console me once more, and again

And again You answer
Again I need You and again You're there
Again I reach out and again You hold me
You console me once more, and again, and again, and again, and again
And again, You will come through once again

And again, and again, and again, and again, and again
And again, You will come through once again
And again, and again, and again, and again, and again
And again, You will come through once again
And again, and again, and again, and again, and again
