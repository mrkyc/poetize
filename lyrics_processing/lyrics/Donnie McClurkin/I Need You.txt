Where will I go without, Your hand holding me?
And how could I live without You I can't see?
Lord, what will I do with life, where will I go?
How would I handle things, all that I know?

'Cause I fail, again
When I fall, I fall so short, so short
You know, You know my end Lord
From the start, You know my heart
I need You
I need You

(Say now, where will I, where will I go?)
Where will I go without, Your hand holding me?
(How would I live without You?)
How could I live without You I cannot see?
(What will I do with life? Where will I...)
What will I do with life, where will I go?
(How would I handle things, all that I know?!)
How would I handle things, all that I know?

I fail (I fail), again
(I fall so short)
I fall, I fall so short
(You know my end)
You know (You know)
You know my end (You know my end, Lord)
From the start (from the start)
You know my heart
(Everybody sing, sing!)
I need You
(Come on, sing!)
I need You
(Sing it again, I need You)
I need You
(If you need the Lord, say right now)
I need You
