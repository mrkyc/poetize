Going to the promised land

Make a step down to Wasmara
Then we stopped in Addis Ababa
Made our way to Shahamane land
Riding on the king's highway

To the promised land
Going to the promised land (Oh gosh)
To the promised land (Wo-hoy)
To the promised land (Well)

There's plenty of land for you and I, by and by
Lots of food to share for everyone
No time for segregation in the promised land (Oh gosh)
Take me to the promised land

Then I said to myself, give a thanks for the prophet, God
For he gave me the teachings, so I could a see
The reality of my true being and levity
There's a lot of work to be done (Oh gosh)
In the promised land (Yeah)

Got to take your stand and let the prophets live on (Yeah)

Got a job to be done, so you've got to do it
Even, a little by little

Yes, the promised land
Going to the promised land
Said, the promised land
Going to the promised land

Prophets of the old, said, the West got to perish (Eh, oh)
Don't let your hopes and aspirations crumble before you (No way)
Got to go, got to go, got to go, I got to go, got to go
To the promised land (Oh gosh)
