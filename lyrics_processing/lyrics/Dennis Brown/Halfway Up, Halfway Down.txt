Life can be fun but never a toy
Many a good times, many a bad
Thankful for all those times that I've had
And when the sun comes tomorrow
And if I'm blessed With another day
At least I have found life's middle ground
Halfway up, halfway down
Oh whoa, yeah-ah
Many a sorrows, many a pain
Better a person I have became
Many a laugh and many a smile
Building up from ah every down
And when the sun comes tomorrow
And I'm blessed with another day
At least I have found life's middle ground
Halfway up, whoa oh, halfway down
Ooh.. oh whoa, well
Oh alright
Yes, many a woman, many a man
Have found themselves
Also right where I am
Many a lifetime, many a day
Searching to find a better way
And when the sun comes tomorrow
And I'm blessed with another day
At least I have found life's middle ground
Halfway up, halfway down
