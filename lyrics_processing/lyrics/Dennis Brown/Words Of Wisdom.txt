Wu-hu
Woah, yeah now

I will open my mouth in a parable
And sing the dark sayings of old
And nuff wisdom and knowledge stretch forth their hands
Unto you, oh children, I cry

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men, you will surely fail
Oh yeah, now-now-now, oh yeah

In laughter the heart is sorrowful
Your folly is your reward
Better a dinner of herbs where love is
Than feasting where there is wrath

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Woah, yeah now-now; woah, oh yeah; uh yeah now

So, take heed Jah-people, and live upright
For this is the time that will tell
When the righteous ones shall stand up strong
Oh, why did the heathen rage?

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Woah, yeah now; woh-yeah
Say, you will surely fail (Woh-yeah now; woh-yeah)

I will open my mouth in a parable
And sing the dark sayings of old
And nuff wisdom and knowledge stretch forth their hands
Unto you, oh children, I cry

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men, you will surely fail
Uh-uh-uh; woh-yeah now; uh-uh-uh
Live up, live up, now now, live up!
Never give up righteousness! (Woah-yeah now; keep it up, son) Follow the footsteps of your father (Woah-yeah now-now)
