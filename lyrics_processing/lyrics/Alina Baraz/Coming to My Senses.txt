Head in my direction
Like I'm looking through you, slip in through the preview
Holding my attention
Now I want to hold you, bring your body close to me
I just want a tasting
Touching on a feeling, have it for the weekend
Testing all my patience
Throw me in the deep end
See if I can swim in you (alright)
Tried to paint a picture of you in my mind
But you

You're a color that don't exist
What are you?
I hear sounds you make with my lips
What are you I'm getting so close to?

Coming to my senses, coming to my
Coming to my, coming to my senses
Coming to my senses, coming to my
Coming to my, coming to my senses

My imagination
Turned into existence
Only in an instant
A beautiful creation
You were something different
I would go the distance (Oh yeah)
Tried to paint a picture of you in my mind
But you
You might also like
You're a color that don't exist
What are you?
I hear sounds you make with my lips
What are you I'm getting so close to?

Coming to my senses, coming to my
Coming to my, coming to my senses
Coming to my senses, coming to my
Coming to my, coming to my senses

I feel it taking over, can't control it no more
The energy is pulling me, come on closer
I try to paint a picture of you in my mind
Yeah that's right but

You're a color that don't exist
What are you?
I hear sounds you make with my lips
What are you I'm getting so close to?

Coming to my senses, coming to my
Coming to my, coming to my senses
Coming to my senses, coming to my
Coming to my, coming to my senses
You're a color that don't exist
What are you?
I hear sounds you make with my lips
What are you I'm getting so close to?

Coming to my senses, coming to my
Coming to my, coming to my senses
Coming to my senses, coming to my
