Pull up to the city
Tell me I'm your lily
I'll be in that dress you like
Body in vanilla
Yeah, I know it thrills ya
I know what is on your mind
Take you to a place where
You can see the stars here
Nothing but the radio on

Baby let me love ya
I just wanna hold ya
We got nothing but the time

I'll take you anywhere you say
I'll take you to my hideaway
Baby just tell me the word
I wanna give you the world

Let my love run wild
Let me, let me love you down
Let my love run wild
Let me, let me love you down
Ooh-ohh
Let my love run wild
Let me, let me love you down
Let my love run wild
Let me, let me love you down

You're the honey whiskey
Getting kinda tipsy
You know all the things I like
Lavender and velvet
Yeah, you got me melting
You know what is on my mind
Take you to the islands
I could be the pilot
We can go wherever you like

Baby let me love ya
I just wanna hold ya
We got nothing but the time

I'll take you anywhere you say
I'll take you to my hideaway
Baby, just tell me the word
I wanna give you the world

Let my love run wild
Let me, let me love you down
Let my love run wild
Let me, let me love you down
Ooh-ohh
Let my love run wild
Let me, let me love you down
