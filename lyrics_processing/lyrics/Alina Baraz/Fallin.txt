Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars

Play me out like a song
You shut me down
I want to let you go, but I give in
I stay around
I got to let you know I've got to go
I'm done with you
Feeling dumb, feeling blind
I'm feeling used, but I keep...

Running, running, running back to you
And you keep playing me, playing me, playing me like a fool
I can't stop running, running, running back to you
You just keep playing me, playing me, playing me like a fool

Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars
You might also like
Catch my breath, then watch you go
I can't forget the things you put me through
You don't care
You got me wrapped around you
I come back
You love that, I know you do
Feeling dumb, feeling blind
I'm feeling used, but I keep...

Running, running, running back to you
And you keep playing me, playing me, playing me like a fool
I can't stop running, running, running back to you
You just keep playing me, playing me, playing me like a fool

Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars

Why do I keep running?
(Running, running, running back to you)
Why can't I stop running?
(Running, running, running back to you)
I just keep on running
(Running, running, running back to you)
I cannot stop running
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
Into the night, I see nothin' but stars

Into the night, I see nothin' but stars falling
