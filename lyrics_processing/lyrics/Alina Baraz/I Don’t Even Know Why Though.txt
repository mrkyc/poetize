Yeahhh

You know what to say on my way out
Hit me with the "Hey, been a while,"
Now I'm going straight through the fire, fire
(I don't even know why though)
Get me on a wave then you fade out
Hit me with the, "Life got me tired"
I should get away from you, I know, I know
(I don't even know why though)

High hopes, I fall for the cycle
High low, I'm on on a spiral
Love me, wide open then leave me
I don't (I don't even know why though)

I just want to put my weight on you
Switch it, smoke it, I'ma sway on you
Know I shouldn't, I'ma wait on you
I don't even know why though
I just want to put my weight on you
Switch it, smoke it, I'ma sway on you
Know I shouldn't, I'ma wait on you
I don't even know why though
You might also like
Maybe it's the love that you show me
Make my body feel like it's holy
Feels too good to stay, you hurt too much to leave
You're just what I need
(I don't even know why though)

High hopes, I fall for the cycle
High low, I'm on on a spiral
Love me, wide open then leave me
I don't (I don't even know why though)

Know I shouldn't, I'ma wait on you
I don't even know why though

Know I shouldn't, I'ma wait on you
I don't even know why though
