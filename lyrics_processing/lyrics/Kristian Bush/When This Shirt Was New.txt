Can barely read the letters printed on the front
From the band and the show where I got it from
Tried to steal it from me, tried to trade me for it
I swear it's never looked better than the day you wore it
Got some holes in it, got some paint on
I remember us as clear as the day I bought it

When this shirt was new, and we were two
Rock 'n' roll love-blind lovers
Time may fade the blue to gray
What we had don't wash away, no
I'm always thinking 'bout it, always smiling 'bout it
That fast car, guitar summer
And the girl that I loved
Back when this shirt was new

You know I love that picture, you look so happy in it
Life goes by fast, man, they weren't kiddin'
You probably cut your hair, changed a thing or two, but
You asleep in my shirt's how I remember you
It's got some years on it, had your tears on it
Still get a little choked up
You might also like
When this shirt was new, and we were two
Rock 'n' roll love-blind lovers
Time may fade the blue to gray
What we had don't wash away
I'm always thinking 'bout it, I'm always smiling 'bout it
That fast car, guitar summer
And the girl that I loved
Back when this shirt was new

Yeah, your memory just gets better with time
Softer, sweeter in the back of my mind
And once in a while, I unfold it
Hold it against my skin
I start remembering back

When this shirt was new, and we were two
Just love-blind lovers
And time may fade the blue to gray
But what we had
When this shirt was new, and we were two
Rock 'n' roll love-blind lovers
Time may fade the blues to gray
What we had don't wash away
I always think about it, wouldn't be me without it
That fast car, guitar summer
And the girl that I loved
Back when this shirt was new
And the girl that I loved
Back when this shirt was new
And the girl that I loved
