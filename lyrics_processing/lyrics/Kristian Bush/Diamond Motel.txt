I'm staying at the air condition diamond motel
Drinking too much, feeling pretty swell
Right off Highway 68, the road to Mexicali
Motorhomes cut through the imperial valley
There's a pink neon sign glowing like a jewel
Santa Ana wind blew the D into the pool
I laugh at everything 'cause reality is cruel
If you take it all so serious you'll feel just like a fool

It sparkles like a diamond in the desert sun
No one ever finds you, you're safe from everyone
They say one man's heaven is another man's hell
What is real and what's a dream
Somewhere in between (Somewhere in between)
Somewhere in between (Somewhere in between)
Lies the diamond motel

It's a 122 degrees at 4.30 today
All a boy can do is hunker down in the shade
The nights out here are magic and the sky is full of stars
As clear as a tequila here it lies Flores' bar

And it sparkles like a diamond in the desert sun
No one'll ever find you, you'll be safe from everyone
They say one man's heaven is another man's hell
What is real and what's a dream
Somewhere in between (Somewhere in between)
Somewhere in between (Somewhere in between)
Lies the diamond motel
You might also like
And we're eating at Tereza's where the  go
We speak a little Spanish, just enough to know

And it sparkles like a diamond in the desert sun
No one'll ever find you, you'll be safe from everyone
They say one man's heaven is another man's hell
But somedays I just can't tell
I'm somewhere in between (Somewhere in between)
Somewhere in between (Somewhere in between)
'Cause it sparkles like a diamond in the desert sun
No one'll ever find you, you'll be safe from everyone
They say one man's heaven is another man's hell
What is real and what's a dream
Somewhere in between (Somewhere in between)
Somewhere in between (Somewhere in between)
