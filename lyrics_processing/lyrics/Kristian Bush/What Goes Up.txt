So you wanna be an astronaut
Well, man, who doesn't?
I made a plywood launchpad sittin' on a trash can
Yard's on fire, blame it on your cousin
Yeah, you seen that smoke? Life's like that
One minute, you got everything you wanted in it
Then it's gone in seconds flat

What goes up comes down, you blink and somehow
You're back to the beginning
Though we don't look like it now, you'll figure out
It's how you keep the whole thing spinning
When you're down, down, down
Remember what goes up

Look at those clouds
They know a thing or two
You gotta lay down what you're carryin' around
For it to come back to you
And see the red balloons? They're kinda like us
Right now we're caught in the trees, but one good breeze
And, baby, we're back in love
You might also like
What goes up comes down, you blink and somehow
You're back to the beginning
Though we don't look like it now, you'll figure out
It's how you keep the whole thing spinning
When you're down, down, down
Remember what goes up

What goes up (Can you feel it?)
What goes up (In your chest)
What goes up when you jump in the air
At the top of the swing at the swing set
What goes up (Like a plane)
What goes up (It's the same)
How many times do you have to land on your feet
Before you believe it?

What goes up comes down, you blink and somehow
You're back to the beginning
Though we don't look like it now, you'll figure out
Even when you lose, you're winning
When you're down, down, down
Remember what goes up
What goes up
So you wanna be an astronaut
Man, who doesn't?
You see that smoke?
