Let me be your private drive
Let me be the place you hide
Let me be your front door keys
Let me be your satin sheets
Let me be your crystal chandelier
Two carat diamonds in your ear
Let me be your dream when life gets hard
Let me be your bodyguard

Baby, let me be your mansion
Lovin' you up in fashion
Spiral staircase dancin'
Close your eyes and imagine a new house on the hill
I could be your glass of champagne
Your Maserati in the fast lane
I wanna be your luxury, your balcony, if you'd let me be
Baby, let me be your mansion

Let me be the water in your sky blue pool
Can make you float and keep you cool
The candlelight to light your face
We could be a golden place
We could be a golden place

I wanna be your luxury, your balcony, if you'd let me be
Baby, let me be your mansion
Baby, let me be your mansion

Golden statues, lush green lawn
Girl, my heart's where you belong
Long silk curtains hanging down
My boot fills with solid ground

Baby, let me be your mansion
Lovin' you up in fashion
Spiral staircase dancin'
Close your eyes and imagine a new house on the hill
I could be your glass of champagne
Your Maserati in the fast lane
I wanna be your luxury, your balcony, if you'd let me be
Baby, let me be your mansion
Baby, let me be your mansion
A new house on the hill
Baby, say that you will
