You only get so many heartbeats
You only get so many sighs
You only get so many footprints
Walking side by side
Some are gonna feel like fireworks
Some are gonna feel like rain
Some are gonna cure like medicine
Some will just dull the pain

It's who you call at two o'clock
In the afternoon
Not who you call at two AM
Alone inside your room

Everybody needs a somebody
Not just any warm body
A strong heart that'll live to love me
For who I am and who I wanna be
Everybody gotta fall to pieces
And get back up before you believe it
It'll all make sense when you see it
So let it be, let it be, yeah
Everybody needs a somebody
Everybody needs a somebody
You might also like
You never find it if you're looking for it
So just sit back in your seat
Life gets better when you lazy pour it
So just put up your feet

It's who you wish was next to you
When you're waking up
It's someone's arms you fall into
Will always me enough

Everybody needs a somebody
Not just any warm body
A strong heart that'll live to love me
For who I am and who I wanna be
Everybody gotta fall to pieces
And get back up before you believe it
It'll all make sense when you see it
So let it be, let it be, yeah
Everybody needs a somebody
Everybody needs a somebody

It's who you call at two o'clock
In the afternoon
Not who you call at two AM
Alone inside your room
Everybody needs a somebody
And not just any warm body
Everybody gotta fall to pieces
And get back up before they believe it
I can't wait for you to see it
So let it be, let it be, yeah
Everybody needs a somebody
(Let it be, let it be)
Everybody needs a somebody
