If you're gonna blow a kiss to a stranger in a parade as it rolls by
If you need somebody to lift you up off the ground to feel alive
If you're gonna break all the hearts in your path that you made skip a beat
'Cause you're lookin' for one to set you free

Let it be me that can wrap you up in the dark 'til the sun drips through that door
Let it be me that can hold the whole world back when you can't take it anymore
Let it be me that gets to feel your skin, the only name you're whisperin'
I can save you, girl, you could save me back
Let it be me

If you're gonna pick one forever
And your heart needs a new tattoo
Someone to walk beside you no matter what you're walkin' through
If you're lookin for a shoulder to lay your head down after work
Someone to turn you on 'til you're dizzy
Make you laugh until it hurts

Let it be me that can wrap you up in the dark 'til the sun drips through that door
Let it be me that can hold the whole world back when you can't take it anymore
Let it be me that gets to feel your skin, the only name you're whisperin'
I can save you, girl, you could save me back
Let it be me
Let it be me

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hold me close
And slip into my arms
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I know
Is if you want somebody to feel your sky with stars

Let it be me that can wrap you up in the dark 'til the sun drips through that door
Let it be me that can hold the whole world back when you can't take it anymore
Let it be me that gets to feel your skin, the only name you're whisperin'
I can save you, girl, you could save me back
Let it be me
Let it be me
Oh, let it be me
