She goes mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

If I'm dancin' and I'm drinkin' and the cover band is singin'
I go mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
If I'm fishin' and I'm leanin' back on that Georgia riverbank
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

But the smile you see is there 'cause she
Is my always-on favorite song

You know, you know that she's a shot of tequila, Southern Mona Lisa
She's the reason you believe in stayin' here and never leavin'
She's shinin' in the shade, sippin' sweet tea lemonade
If she's askin' you to stay, you got it made

And she goes mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
You might also like
She's a perfect mess in her favorite party dress
She's a diamond and she don't know it
And every time I see her sleepin' in my T-shirt
I go mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

'Cause she's a shot of tequila, Southern Mona Lisa
She's the reason you believe in stayin' here and never leavin'
She's shinin' in the shade, sippin' sweet tea lemonade
If she's askin' you to stay, you got it made

And she goes mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
And I go mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

The way she smiles, it's like I'm gettin' high
Her eyes, they leave me hypnotized
There are no words for the way her curves
Go mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
You know, you know that she's a shot of tequila, Southern Mona Lisa
She's the reason you believe in stayin' here and never leavin'
She's shinin' in the shade, sippin' sweet tea lemonade
If she's askin' you to stay, you got it made

And she goes mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
And I go mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

And I go mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
