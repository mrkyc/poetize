There's something you should know that your mama never told ya
Daddy shoulda named you Sugar Magnolia
Blonde hair wild and her blue eyes shinin' true
Hangin' out the window of that old VW
It's easy to see you were born to be
An American beauty, feels like I'm trippin' now

(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Girl, you got me faded
Movin' back and forth with the way you're swayin'
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, hey) You get away with it
Every time you move like you do, you get away with it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Faded
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Girl, you got me faded
Faded

Fire on the mountain, you're the ripple in the stream
You're the ramblin' rose of every man's dream
You kiss me, girl, there ain't nothin' better
How do we make this love last forever? And
You smile and laugh and you say to me
"If you love 'em, set 'em free"

(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Girl, you got me faded
Movin' back and forth with the way you're swayin'
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, hey) You get away with it
Every time you move like you do, you get away with it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Faded
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Girl, you got me faded
Faded
