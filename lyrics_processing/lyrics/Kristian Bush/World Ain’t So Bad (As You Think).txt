For every paycheck gone too fast
There's a memory that's gonna last
For every hole in your boot got you a step or two closer
For every goodbye, there's a hello
For every bad boy, there's a good ol' Joe
For every tear that falls, there's a head layin' on a shoulder

Yeah, the world ain't as bad as you think
Might be some holes in your jeans
A couple more in your dreams
Least you've still got 'em, yeah
The song's only sad as you sing
La-di-da-da-da-di
Half-full over half-empty drink
Sure beats the bottom, yeah
The world ain't as bad as you think, ain't as bad as you think
The world ain't as bad as you think, ain't as bad as you think

For every "hell no," there's a "hell yes"
For every breakup, there's a just-met
For every song you hate, there's one you can't not dance to
For every wrong word, there's a right one
For every black dress, there's a white one
For every burnout star, there's a bright one
For every put-it-out, there's a just-light-one

The world ain't as bad as you think, ain't as bad as you think
Yeah
