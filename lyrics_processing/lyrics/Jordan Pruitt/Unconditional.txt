You got me, I know that you always have
When I'm looking up over my shoulder
Will you'll be there when I get older?
Cause I'm dependent on you and
When I go wrong, it's okay
I'm not alone, you're there beside me
Confident, cause I'm feeling you guide me
I couldn't do without you, no

Troubles with my guy, issues with my girls
You cover me with your love
So I know it's gonna be alright
I know it's gonna work out fine

There are some times when I'm running low
And I hear your voice like the radio
Lifting me up, right to a better place
Where love is unconditional
When the world fights back
And this crazy train gets a bit off track
Remember your words, there's always another way
When love is unconditional
You might also like
You know me inside out
Know my good and bad, but you still love me
So, thank you, for taking care of me
I know you'll always come through and
Even when I might fall down
I don't know just how, but you always pick me up
And I know you will never remind me
What would I do without you through

Troubles with my guy, issues with my girls
You cover me with your love
So I know it's gonna be alright
I know it's gonna work out fine

There are some times when I'm running low
And I hear your voice like the radio
Lifting me up, right to a better place
Where love is unconditional
When the world fights back
And this crazy train gets a bit off track
Remember your words, there's always another way
When love is unconditional
And when I think I'm about to let go
There you are cheering me on
And it ain't even about what's reciprocal
Cause you ask for nothing in return
It's just unconditional
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, ooh
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh

There are some times when I'm running low
And I hear your voice like the radio
Lifting me up, right to a better place
Where love is unconditional
When the world fights back
And this crazy train gets a bit off track
Remember your words, there's always another way
