I like staying up all night
I think it's my right
Sleeping till noon
I love watching scary movies
I could stay shopping all day
Getting my way
And trying on shoes
Don't tell me what I should be doing

Give me a break
I'm just a teenager
I like putting things off 'til later
Just hanging out, having fun, taking my time
Give me a break
I'm just a teenager
I'm automatically attracted to danger
I can't help myself
Can't be no one else
I'm just a teenager

I dread making my bed
I wish I could get out of cleaning my room
Cause I hate keeping my friends waiting
Fast cars
Playing it by heart
Googling stars
And surfing for tunes
Does anyone here get what I'm saying?

Just hanging out, having fun, taking my time
Give me a break
I'm just a teenager
I'm automatically attracted to danger
I can't help myself
Can't be no one else
I'm just a teenager

*phone rings*
Jordan: Hello, this is Jordan
Girl: Hey, what's up?
Jordan: You'll never guess who called me yesterday
Girl: Who?
Jordan: You know that guy that's taking me to Homecoming?
Girl: Yeah
Jordan: He was like, "You took my breath away when I saw you."
Girl: *laugh*
Jordan: He called me sweetie too!
Girl: Aww
Jordan: I don't know if I like him though
I want more minutes on my cell phone
I want credit card of my own
I want the keys to the Mercedes Benz, yeah
I want to wear what I wanna wear
I want a curfew that I think it's fair
I want to chill at the mall with my friends
At the mall with my friends
Does anyone here get what I'm saying?
Just hanging out, having fun, taking my time
