Who is this stranger I see behind my eyes
Letting fear decide who she will be?
Do I know this person, living in my skin?
'Cause each mistake she makes is hurting me
Who is this girl
Giving into this world, this world, this world?

'Cause I lost who I am, so now where do I go?
I'm staring in the mirror at a face I used to know
Can someone get me back to where I'm meant to be?
Next time I catch my reflection, I wanna see me
I wanna see me

How did I arrive here? I don't want regrets
Can I make a change and start again? Oh
My eyes are now wide open, I can see the truth
The daylight starting to flood in
I wanna feel
Like I'm back to what's real, what's real, what's real

Today is a new day to move beyond the past, whoa
These mistakes I've been making can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
'Cause I know who I am
Ooh

'Cause I know who I am
('Cause I know who and where I want to go)
I'm staring in the mirror, see the girl I used to know
Seems like I'm getting back to who I used to be
Next time I catch my reflection, I'm gonna see me
'Cause I know who I am and where I want to go
I'm staring in the mirror, see the girl I used to know
Seems like I'm getting back to where I'm meant to be
Next time I catch my reflection, I'm gonna see me
