I don't wanna get up
Cause I couldn't sleep last night
I wanna stay in bed all day
Watch the TV and cry
Boy, you got me wound up, oh
I'm down, and I won't lie
You made a fool of me
Now my heart is so empty

And all the simple things
Remind me of just how good it used to be
But now you're gone, ain't you, baby?
Do all the simple things
Remind you just how much you cared for me?
But we're all alone now, ain't we?

I just need a haircut
Get my independence back
Need my mom to call up
Have a real long girly chat
How am I supposed to move on
When you're the best thing I ever had?
How could you walk away and not even look back?
You might also like
And all the simple things
Remind me of just how good it used to be
But now you're gone, ain't you, baby?
Do all the simple things
Remind you just how much you cared for me?
But we're all alone now, ain't we?

The t-shirt that you left behind
The voice mail that I play all the time
The photo of us on the shelf
Laughing it off when the car broke down
Watching DVDs and falling asleep
Your text message that I can't delete, oh
The keychain of your name that I got
I could go on and on, and on, and on
How we used to be
Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

And all the simple things
Remind me of just how good it used to be
But now you're gone, ain't you, baby?
Do all the simple things
Remind you just how much you cared for me?
But we're all alone now, ain't we?
I don't wanna get up
