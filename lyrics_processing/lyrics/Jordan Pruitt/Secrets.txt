Secrets... are no good

I know your secret
I know who you're really with
You told me one thing and I saw something different
Why all the secrets?
You could've told me who you're really with
So I didn't have to find out
That you'd be leaving me here like this

(Do, do, do, do, do) Why'd you do it?
(Do, do, do, do, do) Why'd you do it?

Guess I had to let you go
Cause I was the last the know
That our love was on the ropes
You just can't fix what's already broke
So today, I'll set you free
From the secret that you keep
It's so sad you had to sneak
You thought you had it all
But now you don't have me
You might also like
(I thought I had it all) You don't have me
(I should've had it all) You can't have me
(I would've had it all) Oh, yeah

Humiliated, all I wanted was the truth
Not appreciated
Was I not good enough for you?
Manipulated, you pulled the covers over my eyes
So I couldn't see what you were doing
You were just a player in disguise

(Do, do, do, do, do) Why'd you do it?
(Do, do, do, do, do) Why'd you do it?

Guess I had to let you go
Cause I was the last the know
That our love was on the ropes
You just can't fix what's already broke
So today, I'll set you free
From the secret that you keep
It's so sad you had to sneak
You thought you had it all
But now you don't have me
(I thought I had it all) You don't have me
(I should've had it all) You can't have me
(I would've had it all) Oh, yeah

All your secrets hurt so bad
Oh, why'd you do it?
You didn't have to do it

Guess I had to let you go
Cause I was the last the know
That our love was on the ropes
You just can't fix what's already broke
So today, I'll set you free
From the secret that you keep
It's so sad you had to sneak
You thought you had it all
But now you don't have me

(I thought I had it all) You don't have me
(I should've had it all) No, you can't have me
(I would've had it all) Oh, yeah
(I thought I had it all)
(I should've had it all)
(I thought I had it all)
(I should've had it all)
