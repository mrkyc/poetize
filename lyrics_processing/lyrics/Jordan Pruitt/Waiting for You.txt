Well I'm not the type
To hand my heart over
Thought I was stronger
So I'm wondering why
I can't shake this feeling
Look what you're doing to me
No, I'm not the type, not the type
To move in too quickly
Whenever you're near me
I just can't deny
The way that I'm feeling
I don't know what happens to me

I get nervous
I get breathless
When you're here next to me, and

Some people wait for a lifetime to feel like this, baby
They keep waiting
So let's take a chance while it's here, while we can, we can make it
But don't keep me waiting for you
On you

Well, it's Friday night
I just tried to call you
I wonder where you are
Is everything alright?
I wanna be with you
I wish I could reach you
I wish I could see you right now

I'm so anxious
I don't wanna lose you
Or lose what we have, cause

Some people wait for a lifetime to feel like this, baby
They keep waiting
So let's take a chance while it's here, while we can, we can make it
But don't keep me waiting for you
On you

Some people wait
Thinking someday
They'll find something better
But I'm not afraid of making mistakes
So I'll, I'll take my chance
Some people wait for a lifetime to feel like this, baby
They keep waiting
So let's take a chance while it's here, while we can, we can make it
But don't keep me waiting
Some people wait for a lifetime to feel like this, baby
They keep waiting
So let's take a chance while it's here, while we can, we can make it
But don't keep me waiting for you
On you
