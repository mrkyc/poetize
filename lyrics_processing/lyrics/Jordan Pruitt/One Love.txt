Something 'bout the way you move
When you move, that I love, love, love
Something 'bout the way you talk
When you talk, that I can't get enough
The way you say it's a beautiful day
When the rain comes down, down, down
And I don't care if we don't go nowhere
As long as you're around, 'round, 'round, yeah

No one gonna break our stride
We walking side by side
We ride, we ride, oh

Some say maybe this one, maybe that one
Never sure of the one they depend on
I say you're the right one, baby
Come carry me away, oh
One love, one love, one love, one love that I'm sure of
One love, one love, one love that I can't get enough of
That I can't get enough of
One love that I'm sure of

Everytime that you look at me and smile
Like you smile, my heart go boom, boom, boom
Anytime you're not around, I'm in a crowd
It feels just like an empty room
And when the music playing
You come and hold me and we sway, sway, sway
And even when I'm wrong, you tell that I'm right
And it's okay, okay, okay
You might also like
No one gonna break our stride
We walking side by side
We ride, we ride, oh

Some say maybe this one, maybe that one
Never sure of the one they depend on
I say you're the right one, baby
Come carry me away, oh
One love, one love, one love, one love that I'm sure of
One love, one love, one love that I can't get enough of

Some get 'em for the money
Some get 'em for the fame
Some play it like a game, just because they can
I'm in it cause, I wanna be
Boy, you were made for me, stay with me
Baby, you know
Oh oh, ooh yeah

Some say maybe this one, maybe that one
Never sure of the one they depend on
I say, you're the right one
Baby, come carry me away, oh
One love, one love, one love, one love, love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love that I'm sure of
One love, one love, one love that I can't get enough of
