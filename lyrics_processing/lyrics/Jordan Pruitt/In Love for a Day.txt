It was magical, beautiful
I didn't know how it all began
One day, 24 hours
It didn't turn out how I planned
Cause I did what expect to feel the way
The way I do, for a single day
And both of us, we knew we could not stay
You had yours, I had mine, separate lives
But at least we had the night

I was in love for a day
Love, in a way
Love, can't explain why you went you away
Love, it's a shame
Love, you didn't stay in love with me

Unforgettable, incredible
I didn't know how to handle it
I was unprepared, maybe a little scared
Of something I may never get, ooh yeah
I was never one to believe
Love at first sight could get to me
And maybe if these feelings stay the same
I'll be with you again one day, but baby, either way
You might also like
I was in love for a day
Love, in a way
Love, can't explain why you went you away
Love, it's a shame
Love, you didn't stay in love with me

And maybe some day we'll be reconnected
It was so powerful, I can't believe it's over yet
The way you play back in my mind makes it hard to forget you
I know you have your life and I have mine
But someday maybe we will re-collide
But until then, baby, I know (I know)

I was in love for a day
Love, in a way
Love, can't explain why you went you away
Love, it's a shame
Love, you didn't stay in love with me

(With me, with me, with me, with me)
If you hear me, if you hear me - holla!
(With me, with me, with me, with me)
If you hear me, if you hear me - holla!
Love, in a way
Love, can't explain why you went you away
Love, it's a shame
Love, you didn't stay in love with me
