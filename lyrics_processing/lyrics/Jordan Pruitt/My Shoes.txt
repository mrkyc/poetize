I see you standing by your locker all day
I wanna say hey
But boy, I'm too shy to break the ice
I know you know a lot of my friends
I heard this from them
You're not only fine, you're so nice

They could see that
Because of you, I've got it so bad
I wonder if you know
(You're the one, boy)
But I need help with my approach, boy

If only you could step in my shoes
You'd know how I feel
You'd know that I'm good for you
If only you could step in my shoes
Baby, you'd see what I mean
And let me just make a move
If only you could step in my shoes
Step in my shoes, baby yeah, baby yeah
Step in my shoes, baby yeah, baby yeah
You might also like
Sometimes I think you're looking over at me
Like I'm what you need
But maybe it's all in my mind
I wish that I could give you a call
Confessing it all
And one of these days I just might

Get your number
But for now, I'll have to wonder

If only you could step in my shoes
You'd know how I feel
You'd know that I'm good for you
If only you could step in my shoes
Baby, you'd see what I mean
And let me just make a move
If only you could step in my shoes
Step in my shoes, baby yeah, baby yeah
Step in my shoes, baby yeah, baby yeah

What would it be like if you weren't walking right by?
If I fessed up, said what's up, would I get a reply?
If you knew what I knew, I bet that you would smile
You'd see it through my eyes
If only you could step in my shoes
Step, step in my shoes
Baby, I'm so into you
Step, step in my shoes
If only you could step in my shoes
You'd know how I feel
You'd know that I'm good for you
If only you could step in my shoes
Baby, you'd see what I mean
And let me just make a move
If only you could step in my shoes
Step in my shoes, baby yeah, baby yeah
