I've seen you around a lot before
Always looking like a movie star
Hanging out with all your friends
In your Porsche Cayenne, for sure
All the girls think you're a dream
And I know just what they mean
In your aviator shades
Always rocking all your faves - oh yeah

Your life
Boy, you really got it made
Your ride
Yeah, your daddy's getting paid
Your house
And all that stuff you got
Well, you might think you're hot
But what I wanna say

If that's what it's gonna take to be
The kind of girl you need
If that's what you're looking for from me
What you want to see
Nothing but material things
I'll catch you later
Do me a favor
If that's the kind of vibe you wanna find
And what's on your mind
If all you want is someone you can buy
I'm leaving you behind
Cause you don't care about the girl inside
You're a player
So see you later
You might also like
You never wear the same thing twice
I bet that smile cost quite a price
I know you've never worked a day
But you got it anyway

Your life
Boy, you really got it made
Your ride
Yeah, your daddy's getting paid
Your house
And all that stuff you got
Well, you might think you're hot
But what I gotta say

If that's what it's gonna take to be
The kind of girl you need
If that's what you're looking for from me
What you want to see
Nothing but material things
I'll catch you later
Do me a favor
If that's the kind of vibe you wanna find
And what's on your mind
If all you want is someone you can buy
I'm leaving you behind
Cause you don't care about the girl inside
You're a player
So see you later
You're a player
So see you later
So you think that I would spend my time
With someone that plays like you
That I would just fall for you
I think you oughta know by now
That's not enough for me
You're wasting your time with me
I'm gonna make you understand
That I'm not impressed with you
Got better things to do
I'm gonna put you in your place
Cause I think you need to know
Boy, that you gotta go

If that's what it's gonna take to be
The kind of girl you need
If that's what you're looking for from me
What you want to see
Nothing but material things
I'll catch you later
Do me a favor
If that's the kind of vibe you wanna find
And what's on your mind
If all you want is someone you can buy
I'm leaving you behind
Cause you don't care about the girl inside
You're a player
So see you later
If that's what it's gonna take to be
With someone that plays like you
If that's what you're looking for from me
Like I would just fall for you
Nothing but than material things
That's not enough for me
You're wasting your time with me
If that's that kind of vibe you wanna find
Then I'm not impressed with you
