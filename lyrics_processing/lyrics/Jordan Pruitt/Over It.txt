Get over it

You got caught up
In all your stuff
And didn't have the time to think about us
You tried to hide
Behind your lies
You'll have to face the consequence
I've lost my trust in you
And baby, now we're through

I've had enough and I'm not looking back
I'm over it, I'm over it
I'm moving on cause you blew your chance
So, get over it, I'm over it
You broke my heart, gonna break yours back
I'm over it, so over it
It's time to draw the line
Don't want you to be mine
I'm over it

You call me at home
And on my cell phone
Constantly trying to tell me
You want me back
Well, good luck with that
Baby, I'm not going to play these games with you
I said we're through, whoa
You might also like
I've had enough and I'm not looking back
I'm over it, I'm over it
I'm moving on cause you blew your chance
So, get over it, I'm over it
You broke my heart, gonna break yours back
I'm over it, so over it
It's time to draw the line
Don't want you to be mine
I'm over it

I was yours, you were mine, we were fine
'Til you let it all slip away
('Til you let it all slip away)
The mistakes that you made can't be changed
I don't care if it makes you insane
Why'd you have to be like that
And do those things behind my back
And now I'm slipping away from you
And I won't come back cause
Cause I hate all the things you put me through, yeah
I'm over it, I'm over it, yeah
Get over it, I'm over it
Ooh, whoa oh
I'm over it, so over it
It's time to draw the line
Don't want you to be mine
I'm over it

I've had enough and I'm not looking back
I'm over it, I'm over it
I'm moving on cause you blew your chance
So, get over it, I'm over it
You broke my heart, gonna break yours back
I'm over it, so over it
It's time to draw the line
Don't want you to be mine
