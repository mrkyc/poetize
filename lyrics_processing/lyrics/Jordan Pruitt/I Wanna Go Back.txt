Oh, yeah yeah

I wanna go back to the way it was
When I knew that you were mine
I wanna know how it feels to love
The pure and easy kind
I wanna go back to the way it was
Baby, tell me where you're at
Cause I wanna go back, I wanna go back

Flashback to a better day
Snapshot of your love in a way
You always knew how to turn it on
Made me smile when my joy was gone
When did we lose all the words to say?
When did the colors turn to grey?
Nothing can live, when it's in the dark
Tell me when did we lose the spark, yeah

I wanna go back to the way it was
When I knew that you were mine
I wanna know how it feels to love
The pure and easy kind
I wanna go back to the way it was
Baby, tell me where you're at
Cause I wanna go back, I wanna go back
You might also like
Did you forget how it used to be?
The only thing on your mind was me
Now it seems like your far away
Even when we're face to face
And everything that you promised me
Hasn't become a reality
You better just stop and think
Cause you're about to lose me

I wanna go back to the way it was
When I knew that you were mine
I wanna know how it feels to love
The pure and easy kind
I wanna go back to the way it was
Baby, tell me where you're at
Cause I wanna go back, I wanna go back

When I look into your eyes, I want to know you understand
Do you still get butterflies, when I'm just being who I am?
And when the phone rings, would you answer if you knew it was me?
Knew it was me

I wanna go back to the way it was
When I knew that you were mine
I wanna know how it feels to love
The pure and easy kind
I wanna go back to the way it was
Baby, tell me where you're at
Cause I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go, wanna go back
