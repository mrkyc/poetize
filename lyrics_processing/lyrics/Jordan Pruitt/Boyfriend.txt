I see you with him, and I see you laughing
And I see you flipping your hair
Like you think you're hypnotizing my man
But it's not gonna go as you plan
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
You think you're clever, but I've got something better
My guy, he texts me letters, spelling "T.T.I.C."
And only I know, only I know what that means
'This girl is crazy'

No, you're not
No, you're not
No, you're not
No, you're not
No, you're not

You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
You're not gonna steal him, not now
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
No way, no way, no how
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
No matter how you work it
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
And that's the final verdict
So don't think you'd ever have a shot
Cause if you had a shot you'd miss completely
You might also like
I see you flirting, but his head you won't be turning
Instead, you'll just be learning how a real relationship flows
And there's no way with you he's gonna go
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
So put your hips back in check and try never to forget
My guy, you're not gonna get
So what you trying to prove?
He's never gonna leave here with you, no no

No, you're not
No, you're not
No, you're not
No, you're not
No, you're not

You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
You're not gonna steal him, not now
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
No way, no way, no how
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
No matter how you work it
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
And that's the final verdict
So don't think you'd ever have a shot
Cause if you had a shot you'd miss completely
Oh, oh, yeah, oh no
Oh, oh no, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no no no
Oh, oh, no
Oh, oh no, oh

Do you really think you had a chance with him?
Is your perception of this that ignorant?
Do you really think that I would let you in?
How does it feel to lose before you begin?
You should know by know

No, you're not
No, you're not
No, you ain't ever gonna steal me, girl
No, you're not
No, you're not
No, you ain't ever gonna steal me, girl

You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
You're not gonna steal him, not now
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
(No, you're not)
No way, no way, no how
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
(No, you're not)
No matter how you work it
(No, you ain't ever gonna steal me, girl)
You're not gonna steal my boyfriend
And that's the final verdict
So don't think you'd ever have a shot
