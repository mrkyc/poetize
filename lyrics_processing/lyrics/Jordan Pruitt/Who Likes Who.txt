Jenny called me up and said she likes Johnny
But yesterday Johnny said, "Yo, I like Bonnie."
Bonnie likes Jonathan, who's still missing me
Even though we all know he likes Tiffany
Vicky called me on a three way with Cici
And she told me Anthony likes Rissi
Allie's got another thing for Jeffery
Which really bugs me cause she knew that he left me
