I wish I had a dime for all the times I tried
I used to be a one horse show
But that was a long time ago
Somebody'd say something wrong; I'd want to take him outside
Some girl'd look at me twice; I'd want to make her my bride
I used to be a pistol, you know
But that was a long time ago
I'd be settin' on ready at the starting line
Jumping that gun - trying to beat my own time
Back when I knew everything that there was to know
That was a long time ago
I used to drive through the walls; I never drove around
You set 'em up, and I'd knock 'em right down
But I was riding in a rubber rodeo
That was a long time ago
We use to ride all night, and I'd let you off at dawn
Then I'd keep on rockin' until the nest one
I never shifted down into low
But that was a long time ago
Always setting on ready at the starting line
Jumping that gun: trying to beat my own time
Back when I knew everything that there was to know
That was a long time ago
That was a long time ago
That was a long time ago
Long, long long time ago
You might also likeAlways settin' on ready at the starting line
Jumping that gun; trying to beat my own time
Back when I knew everything that there was to know
I never told the truth when a lie would do
I think I was waiting for someone just like you
I'm getting tired of howling at the moon, you know
We used to do that stuff:
Way back a long time ago
A long time ago
That was a long time ago
