Meeting Eddy Pills
I got a couple hundred bills
Man, I hope he rounds it up
Yeah, this one time he rounded up
Where'd my nightclubs go?
I'm wearing my blossom robe
But I can't even get it up
So how am I supposed to give a fuck?

Mama said, "Don't you touch that junk
Even though it feels good
You don't always have to touch wood"

Our sweet parents love us 'cause they don't see
The bags 'round our eyes and all the bruises on our thighs
No one knows you're hurting 'til you start to cry
But if we blow softly, softly, then we'll
Keep the flame alive and watch it burning overnight
Wanna thank you, Mama, for being so blind

Cash stuffed in my underpants
I'm overflowing, watch me dance
Mosquito mass hysteria
I'm serving up malaria
Pigeons sat upon my hat
I'm feeding squirrels, feeding rats
I'll feed your fucking terrier
The Snow White of your area

Papa said, "You don't want that smack
Even though it's on a plate
Better start acting straight, mate"

Our sweet parents love us 'cause they don't see
The bags 'round our eyes and all the bruises on our thighs
No one knows you're hurting 'til you start to cry
I've been shirking my problems, baby
'Cause I'm high off my goddamn tree
This junk don't come for free
They're telling me to hold the line, yeah
But these lines have got a hold on me


Mama said, "Don't you touch that junk
Even though it feels good
You don't always have to touch wood"

Our sweet parents love us 'cause they don't see
The bags 'round our eyes and all the bruises on our thighs
No one knows you're hurting 'til you start to cry
I've been fucking my life up, baby
And I'm dying from misery
This junk don't come for free
They're telling me to hold the line, yeah
