You been in showbiz long enough
You get a grip on how things work
That don't mean it ain't a surprise
When they come to take your show
I been in showbiz long enough
You need to wait your turn
Wait your turn like me

They say the kids don't wanna see
An old dog sing and dance
They say they're done with television
And it ain't gettin' a second chance
But they never waited for their turn
They just snatched it up from dirt
From me

They're gonna steal my show from me
They're gonna steal my show
When you come in here tellin' me I'm done
To pack my things, to leave and go
You're comin' at the oldest dog in here
You need to wait your turn
Wait your turn like I did
You might also like
I been syndicated
Throughout French Amer
They gave me my severance pay
But they never gave me a goddamn
They just stole my show and gave it up
To some fat fuck cryin' with a song about diabetes

Ahmed, my lawyer
He said, "You can't do this"
Ahmed wears a suit and tie
Come on, Ahmed's legit
He's comin' at you like a paralegal nightmare
I got him stayin' up at the Ritz
We're gonna get my show back

We're gonna get my show back
Come on, we're gonna get my show
We're gonna get my show back
Come on, we're gonna get my show
I got too much love stored in me
I got a pain you'll never know
You'll never get my show
But they ignored my lawyer
And they ignored my wife
And I'm sat here thinking
I hate my goddamn life
I used to be the number one entertainer
Now I'm bumpkin with a knife
I'll never get my show back

So I cut some hose
From the local park
And I rigged my car up
Now I'm fumin' in the dark
And I'll tell you all somethin' 'bout flyin'
I never have to jump the shark
Just to get my show back

We're gonna get my show back
Come on, we're gonna get my show
Come on, we're gonna get my show back
Come on, we're gonna get my show
I got too much love stored in me
I got a pain you'll never know
