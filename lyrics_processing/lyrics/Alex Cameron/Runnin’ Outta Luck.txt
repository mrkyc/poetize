There's a light in your hair
An apocalyptic glare
We're in love again
We're in love again
And it looks just like a comet, fire coming from it
Oh, baby, let's just sit back and stare
We're in love again (In love again)
We're in love again (We're in love again)

And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout it
My favourite kind of fever
When you tell me not to doubt it
I tell you I believe you

I'm a man on a mission
You're a stripper out of luck
And we're good in the backseat
But we're better up front
And there's blood on my knuckles
'Cause there's money in the trunk
Keep running out of luck
Keep running out of luck
You might also like
Now there's cash on a stage
Doesn't matter what they paid
We're in love again (In love again)
We're in love again (We're in love again)
So please don't stand around me when she starts her dancing
I'm feeling like I might catch a case
We're in love again (In love again)
I said we're in love again (We're in love again)

And I can't stop thinking 'bout it
She's probably gonna leave you
But she tells me not to doubt it
And I'm starting to believe her
Understand

I'm a man on a mission
You're a stripper out of luck
And we're good in the backseat
But we're better up front
And there's blood on my knuckles
'Cause there's money in the trunk
Keep running out of luck
Keep running out of luck
In a neon boneyard
Raised from the dead
We'll bet on forever
But we both know the spread
And the smoke from your fire's
Going straight to my head
So keep running out of luck
Keep running out of luck

Where you been?
I been in the smoke
Oh, oh, oh

I'm a man on a mission
You're a stripper out of luck
And we're good in the backseat
But we're better up front
And there's blood on my knuckles
'Cause there's money in the trunk
Keep running out of luck
Keep running out of luck

In a neon boneyard
Raised from the dead
We'll bet on forever
But we both know the spread
And the smoke from your fire's
Going straight to my head
So keep running out of luck
Keep running out, out of luck
Keep running, keep running out of luck
Keep running, keep running out of luck
Keep running, keep running out of luck
(Running out of luck)
Keep running, keep running out of luck
Keep running, keep running out of luck
Keep running, keep running out of luck
