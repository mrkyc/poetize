Don't even bother climbing out of the well
That ain't no way to get out of the hell that you're in
If you wanna see the back of it, girl
You better start digging down with your pail of tin
I got shat on by an eagle, baby
Now I'm king of the neighbourhood and it feels like I could
Just peel the gym pants off a single mother
But this run of good luck don't got me feeling all that good

And it hurts, and it hurts
But I don't wanna talk about it

'Cause in my dreams, I miss you
Then I wake up to reality's bliss
Now all I ever wanted and all I ever needed
Is right here in this stranger's kiss

Don't bother flying when you jump off the cliff
Make sure it's head first if you don't want to deal with what ifs
I know you're wondering if you'll feel it again
Just keep on digging it down with your pail of tin
No shame in sleeping with the seagulls, baby
This town's a tourist trap, it's no place to be living
They made a meme out of my legacy, darling
My hands are caught in the net and they're pale and thin
You might also like
And it hurts, and it hurts
But I don't wanna talk about it

'Cause in my dreams, I miss you
Then I wake up to reality's bliss
All I ever wanted and all I ever needed
Was right here in this stranger's kiss

Me and Roy, we got a pretty mean posse
With a Down syndrome Jew from the real estate crew
He keeps me busy with a shift now and then
But it don't ever really stop me from thinking of you
I know you're wondering why you wish you were dead
And there's no solace in the fact that it's all in your head
Try not to focus on the pain that you're in
Just keep on digging down with your pail of tin

If it hurts, well, it hurts
But I don't wanna talk about it

'Cause in my dreams, I miss you
Then I wake up to reality's bliss
Now all I ever wanted and all I ever needed
Is right here in this stranger's kiss
But in my dreams, I'll miss you
Then I'll just stick 'em right there in the bin
Thought I needed buckets of gold
