With my high-starched collar and my high-top shoes
And my hair piled high upon my head
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley
And lost my heart instead
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie
He was quite the handsomest of men
I started to yen so I counted to ten
Then I counted to ten again

"Clang, clang, clang" went the trolley
"Ding, ding, ding" went the bell
"Zing, zing, zing" went my heartstrings
From the moment I saw him I fell
"Chug, chug, chug" went the motor
"Bump, bump, bump" went the brake
"Thump, thump, thump" went my heartstrings
When he smiled I could feel the car shake
(Clang, clang, clang)

He tipped his hat and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death
You might also like
"Buzz, buzz, buzz" went the buzzer
"Flop, flop, flop" went the wheels
"Stop, stop, stop" went my heartstrings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

"Buzz, buzz, buzz" went the buzzer (Clang, clang, clang, clang)
"Flop, flop, flop" went the wheels (Clang, clang, clang, clang)
"Stop, stop, stop" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned, he stayed on with me
And it was grand just to stand with his hand holding mine
To the end of the line

"Clang, clang, clang" went the trolley
"Clang, clang, clang" went the trolley
"Zing, zing, zing, zing" went my heart
