Here we go again
It's time to spend
The last lucky dollar
Can't you see it now
Sleeping on the train
And singing that sad refrain
Oh, you could have been a contender
By the look in their eyes
You can see that they despise you
But you know it doesn't much really matter
Because there's the train, there's the track
Don't say goodbye and don't look back
Because if you do
You know that you're going to shatter
You never took me where I wanted to go
You never told me what I wanted to know
You couldn't see what I was trying to show
It must have been some strange reaction
And you split me when I started to crack
And you forgot me when I went off the track
And you just put another knife in my back
It must have been some strange reaction
You might also likeMust be some strange reaction of a chemical kind
When all your problems develop complications
Can't get to sleep when all the people on the street
Are just like insects crawling on a carcass
And you were crawling when I wanted to fly
And you were laughing when I wanted to cry
Where were you when when I wanted to die?
It must have been some strange reaction
I was cursing when you tried to pray
To an idol with feet of clay
You had a party but nobody came
It must have been some strange reaction, hey
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
It must have been some strange reaction
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
It must have been some strange reaction
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Some strange reaction
Some strange reaction
Some strange reaction
Some strange reaction
It must have been some strange reaction
