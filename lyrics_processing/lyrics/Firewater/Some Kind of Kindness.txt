Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
They say that we can't beat the rap
Just a couple of rats without a hope and both our heads inside a trap
You wash my hands, I'll scratch your back
Because we're so dirty and we need to find
I said, some kind of kindness
Maybe there just ain't no use in trying
Every one of us is born alone and someday soon we will be dying
But don't you ever pay no mind
Because when you lie with me I feel that I
I feel some kind of kindness
You know this is no way for us
Ragged and damned at the heel
And deep down you know
There's gotta be a better life for us
Than drifting like dust through an hourglass
Waiting for our blood to congeal
That's why we're singing...
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
(Still singing, still singing)
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie

Somebody's always got their fingers in somebody else's pie
We may be cheap, but we ain't free
And we're just fighting for the right to know
To know some kind of kindness
We may be deaf, but we ain't dumb
Two more pariahs of the road without a home and on the run
We may be damned, but we're not done
'Cause the time must surely come when we will find
Maybe some kind of kindness
Yeah, this is no place for us
Stuck like sick monkeys in a zoo
Yeah, life is short
And there's gotta be a better way for us
Than sleeping down under the overpass
Dreaming that our dreams have come true
That's why we're singing...
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
(Still singing, still singing)
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
(Still singing)
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
(Still singing, still singing)
