He walked tall with his money in his shoe
With a left and a right
And a-sonny say goodnight
Eyes were a cold steel blue
Momma went down like a ton of coal
Shared her bed with anyone who dared
Wash your hands
Take it like a man
Never let 'em know your scared
Never let 'em know your scared
Oh, what shall we do with the drunken failure?
Shanghai the bastard to Australia
If we never see you again
Buddy that'll be too soon
Everybody knows that the odds ain't even
Show me a god that's worth believing
Better place your bets cause the boat is leaving
Underneath an eastern moon
Underneath an eastern moon
Sissy had a thing for contraband
Nose to the grindstone, finger in the pie
No way out
Give the kid a clout
Drowned her in a pint of rye
You might also likeBrother was a drunken gambling man
Rolled his dice and always played the fool
Roll 'em high
Sock 'em in the eye
Beat him like a rented mule
Beat him like a rented mule
What shall we do with the drunken failure?
Shanghai the bastard to Australia
If we never see you again
Buddy that'll be too soon
Everybody knows that the odds ain't even
Show me a god that's worth believing
Better place your bets cause the boat is leaving
Underneath an eastern moon
Underneath an eastern moon
Daddy was a dirty fighting man
He walked tall with his money in his shoe
With a left and a right
And a-sonny say goodnight
Eyes were a cold steel blue
Momma went down like a ton of coal
Shared her bed with anyone who dared
Wash your hands
Take it like a man
Never let 'em know your scared
Never let 'em know your scared
Never let 'em know your scared
Never let 'em know your scared
