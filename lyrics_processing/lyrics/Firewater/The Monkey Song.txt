A song that they televised nationwide - we had so many requests for them to do it again that that's exactly what they did
So right now, by the miracle of recording
Sing the song that song that probably you haven't heard before
But I'm sure after you hear it this time, you'll want to be hearing it again
It's the Monkey Song!
It ain't the crutches, it's the limp
Not what you lost, it's the things you couldn't find
Don't blame the hooker, charge the pimp
Nothing gets stolen, it's just stuff you leave behind
It ain't really the darkness that you curse
But how it feels when the sun refuse to shine
It's not the future that you fear
But more the feeling that the past is gonna catch you in the hand
So hands up if you wanna do it again (do it again)
Say right now, wanna do it again, do it again?
Monkey girl
I wanna be your monkey man
Monkey girl
I wanna be your monkey man
Let's do it again (do it again)
Let's do it again (do it again)
Let's do it again (do it again)
(it's the monkey song)
You might also likeIt ain't the needle... it's the pricks
You could take the lies, but for the smiles they hide behind
Don't mind the bottles, just the bricks
A man is just a monkey in a suit and tie
It ain't the complex, it's the cure
Ain't no religion, just a hole to hide inside
Don't mind the fire, but how it burns
And this is not the way, the way you would have wanted things to end
So hands up if you wanna do it again (do it again)
Say right now, wanna do it again, do it again?
Monkey girl
I wanna be your monkey man
Monkey girl
I wanna be your monkey man (do it again)
Monkey girl
I wanna be your monkey man (monkey man)
Monkey girl
I wanna be your monkey man
Let's do it again (do it again)
Let's do it again (do it again)
Let's do it again (do it again)
(it's the monkey song)
