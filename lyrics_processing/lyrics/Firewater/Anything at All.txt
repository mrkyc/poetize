I'd watch you when you sleep
And if I was an undertow
I'd drag you to the deep
And if I was a prison
I would hide you in my walls
And if I was an angel
I would catch you when you fall
'Cause it's such a cold day down here in hell
And it's a long way, long way to heaven
But it's okay 'cause we're singing with the angels
And it's such a cold day down here in hell
And it's a long way, long way to heaven
But it's okay 'cause we're singing with the angels
And I would give you everything I have
If I had anything at all
Anything at all
And if I was a memory
I'd creep into your mind
And if I was a tourniquet
I'd never let you die

If I was a hurricane
I'd blow your world apart
All over the world
Winners are cheating
Losers are weeping
Take anything at all
All over the world
Lovers are killing
Suckers are willing
