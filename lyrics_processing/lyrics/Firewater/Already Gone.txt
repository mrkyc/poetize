Of a suicidal state of mind
Because all the love we had was gone
But there was just one more courier flight
And it was leaving in the cold morning light
And that's the one you can be sure that I was on
And so I took a long last glance
Around this glorified garbage can
And then I burned all of my bridges goodbye
And now I'm staggering a jagged line
All around this glorious equator line
So don't come looking, because I'm already gone
And I'm gonna dive, dive, dive, dive into this pale moonlight
And I'm gonna dance, dance, dance until I fall
You know I wanna lose my head inside a song
And I'm gonna drag you all along
But don't you miss me, because I'm already gone
I got a stack of presidents
Stuck way down into my pants
I got a pair of Jesus boots and a head all full of song
Back home I never seem to get it right
But it doesn't seem to matter tonight
Because I'm here and you know I'm already gone
You might also likeAnd I'm gonna dive, dive, dive, dive into this pale moonlight
And I'm gonna dance, dance, dance until I fall
You know I wanna lose my head inside a song
And I'm gonna drag you all along
But don't you miss me, because I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Well I'm one day older
And I'm feeling like a soldier
Yeah, you know it's colder than a morgue out on this quay
But I'm ready for a last trip
As they hoist me on board this container ship
'Cause where I'm going to, nobody knows my name
And I'm gonna dive, dive, dive, dive into this pale moonlight
And I'm gonna dance, dance, dance until I fall
You know I wanna lose my head inside a song
And I'm gonna drag you all along
But don't you miss me, because I'm already gone
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
