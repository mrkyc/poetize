Get Low

Chained to a love
But that don't mean much
Sensitive tough, you don't get enough
I've been drowning in your, lost in the rush
Faded, you stuck? I'll help you up

I don't care if we get too loud
Sexy, I want you now
Bet I could take you there
Whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel?
Let's just enjoy the thrill
I'll take over the wheel
And give you the touch you're missing

Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

I like the way you take me there
I like the way you touch yourself
Don't hold back, I want that
When the water come down, I'mma get in that
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low
Stay

Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay
Stay
Find You

Silent love is calling faith
To shatter me through your hallways
Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal
Make them dance, just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah, you always make me go

(I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself, I will find you)
Yeah, you always make me go (go, go, go...)
(I will find you)

Make them dance, just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah, you always make me go
Spectrum

Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
We'll run

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
I Want You to Know
 
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course
Stay the Night

I know that we are up-side-down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know
That we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

You cue the lights, I'll drop the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why're you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Are you gonna stay the night?
Clarity

Hot dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

Why are you my remedy?
Why are you my clarity?

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
Beautiful now

I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath it
Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
'Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We're beautiful
We're beautiful

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful
Addicted to a Memory

We are, we are a violent chemistry
Love has taken us as far as we can reach
But I can't leave
We are, we are imagined ecstasy
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
