Yo Red, I let 'em know (Yeah, you give it to 'em, shit)
I see my finger in the pussy (What happens?)
The pussy stink, ha ha, she got to go (So what's next?)
Hey, I know you ain't scare to tell them
(That's true, get, know what I'm sayin'?)
I know Big D ain't scared to tell 'em (My rappin' feel style)
Now to hope I do one too (So)
I-I

I met this girl named Melissa, saw her lips, I wanted to kiss her
And her body was so fine, if you touch you'll get your blister
I remember this girl from school
I wanted to smile and act a fool
But I got my dignity so I just stepped and kept my cool
She was standin' all alone, so I guess I got it made
She just broke up with my homie named Dave
I was driven her with my flex, asked her for some sex
I grabbed my jimmy hat because I gotta use protect
My nigga Shaun was in the room, ready to do the switch
I was talkin', rappin', rippin' up the bitch
She was in the motel, everything was goin' swell
Open up her legs, poof, and all the smell
I wasn't goin' for it, the bitch didn't even know it
I'm crawlin' up her pussy, I'm just about to throw it
In the trash, need another stash
I said "Get up, get out with your funky black ass"
I don't like no stanky pussy I'd've peed a rotten bush
I wish, I wish, these hoes would take a douche
You might also like
(I wish, I wish) They would take a douche

I wish, I wish (They would take a douche)

Once upon a time, not too long ago
I went out on a date with a super-duper hoe
I picked her up at home in my Caddy chrome
She wanted to be romantic, so I kissed the bitch and hung
We was on my waterbed, suckin' on my head
She's pullin' down her panties, this is what she said
"Before we get started, I just wanted you to know
I'm not just for you 'cause your name's Kilo"
Yeah right, bitch, stop talkin'
Pull down your legs, close your mouth, and start fuckin'
She was really really fine, fuckin' with my mind
I laid her on the bed and I'm about to bust her spine
I was nibblin' on her neck, suckin' on her pliance
Open up her pussy, and her shit smell like onions
I jumped up off the girl 'cause I didn't want to hurt her
I don't want no onions, don't want no fuckin' cheeseburger
I don't like no stanky pussy, I don't beat around the bush
I wish, I wish, the hoes would take a douche
(I wish, I wish) They would take a douche
(I wish, I wish) Why don't you take a douche?
(I wish, I wish) They would take a douche
(I wish, I wish) I would take a douche
(I wish, I wish, you would take a douche)
(I wish, I wish, you would take a douche)
(I wish, I wish, you would take a douche)
(I wish, I wish)

I got a little fame so the suckas just be hatin'
I drive around town with my Blazer with the Dayton
I met this girl named Kim, she said I'm her favorite rapper
Nah, like fuck, I oughta just slap her
But I kept my concentration on the conversation
Knew that I could hit her, 'cause I felt the vibrations
So I called the A-Town rush, so we could all get wit it
Red Money's on the phone (Yo yo yo, let me hit it!)
So we took her to the band, had a monster playin'
Watch out, my first, let me hit it, man
So I'm takin' off her sweater just so I can get her
She pulled me to the side and said "I gotta know you better"
I said "Baby I'm livin' large, do not like the forty
When my dick's so hard, girl, my dick's a horse"
So we got into the bed, all gettin' closer
Red kicked the bitch 'cause she told it, el poster
I was just about to hit it, and then I called my friend
God damn, it's the same old shit again
She had the kind of a wooshin' that smell like a institution
God damn, I wish these hoes would start douchin'
I don't like no stanky pussy, don't beat around the bush
I wish, I wish, the hoes would take a douche
(I wish, I wish) They would take a douche
(I wish, I wish) I wish you'd take a douche
(I wish, I wish) They would take a douche
(I wish, I wish) You would take a douche
(I wish, I wish, you would take a douche)
(I wish, I wish, you would take a douche)
(I wish, I wish, you would take a douche)
(I wish, I wish, you would take a douche)

Come on y'all, come see me go
This is not a video
Take your seat in church for, and listen to the master go
Suckers try to get me back, but I'm not afraid of that
Hold on to your rhyme, boy, if it was a heart attack
Real nice fella, favorite color yella
Last show I rocked I met a girl named Stella
Got her back stage, first I asked her age
Gave my beeper number and she gave me a page
I was ridin' down the striz-eet in my buddy's jiz-eep
'Bout to fall a siz-eep, then I got a biz-eep
Got her on the phone, she said no one was home
Jumped out of the Jeep then jumped into the chrome
Yes I am a lover too, all my fantasies come true
If you don't believe me, girl, I will show them all to you
Put her in the center, then I go up in her
Grip me on the back and say "Oh Kilo, you're a winner"
Yes I tell her anything, then I hear her start to sing
"Ooh-a-wooh-a-ooh, ooh I love your ding-a-ling"
Don't like no stanky pussy, I don't beat around the bush
I'm glad, this hoe, she took a douche

This baby take a douche
Why don't you take a douche?
Baby, take a douche
