And when I make-make up with Stacy downtown
She said I was a king, and hit you like a clown
She said I was a fool and that was all well and expected
Then she asked me why I put her name on my record
I said "Baby don't be angry, it's all about the money, G
If you be real nice, then I will let you hang with me"
You got somethin' to do? I'll pick you up at tennis
"I ain't got nothin' to do, let's go, I'm finished"
She got into the car with no delay
She started rippin' and rippin' my clothes away
Yeah you still fine, it's been a long time
She said "Who ding-a-ling?", I said it's mine
So I push her to the back and I was hitted on the seat
Up and down was the pattern of the Jeep
When I got finished I made her sing
"Nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling"

Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling

Now I was on the stage, funky funky fresh
A front row fan said I was the best
So I looked at her, and she smiled
And I said "I'll get with you in a little while"
When I got off the stage I went straight to my staff
They asked me to sign some autographs
So I'm signin', I'm signin', suddenly I saw a real nice girl
Said she was Latoya
The afterparty, that's the place to be
I said "After this, baby, you goin' with me"
She just smiled and said no, I said "Here we go"
And when my car pulled off, she was in the limo
At the motel we had a little party
The girl got bit, drink drink Bacardi
Five minutes later I was in her vagina
A knock at the door, her boyfriend's tryin' to find her
Man, you shoulda seen it, it was like a cartoon
They beat that nigga ass down in Red room
So I gave the guy's girl, "Oh, here's your earring"
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
You might also like
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling

I'm still young, dumb, and full of cum
I'm not send you my dick, come and get you some
If I give you my number, then you better call it
It's a one time offer of nuttin' at all
I get physical, plus I'm lyrical
And if you're conscious woman finish, it's a miracle
I'm not braggin', but the fella's droppin' salt
You girl was playin' in the trap and got caught
I'm a hunter, and I'm huntin' your girl
There's a lot of women in this man-made world
Like a fisherman, lot of fish in the sea
Don't be cryin' when you girl come swimmin' to me
You a snake, then I'm an alligator
And if you're slow, then I'm a vibrator
Ain't no cut on my dick, it's pure dope
And if you put it in your mouth, you might choke
So by now you know the song, so go ahead and sing
"Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling"
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling
Ain't nothin' like Kilo's ding-a-ling

Now Yolanda, I kept her number
I got up little one day last summer
I arrived at her house with the pizza box
From the look of the house, it was built for a fuss
Walkin' towards the door, I heard a record begin
This girl yelled out "Let yourself in!"
So I did, waitin' all my money
From the top of the step "Come and get it, honey"
Walked up the step, went through the big door
What in the world wants me up here for?
Ran past the room then I turnt around
I saw the red bone in a cold night gown
She grabbed me in the room and then she closed the door
I tripped over her poodle and I hit the floor
The big one only her, man, there was more
I felt like a seashell being washed to the shore
I kept on asking "How much time y'all got?"
But they didn't want no pizza, man, these hoes was hot
The hit me when I hollered, they hit me when I ach
Now tell them what they did if I yell eight
After five hours, these girls got tired
Can't go back to work 'cause I knew that I was fired
Runnin' around the house like I was a star
Fell down the steps, ran back to my car
I got outside and I heard 'em sing
"Ooh I love your ding-a-ling"
My Kilo's ding-a-ling, ooh I love my Kilo's ding-a-ling
Yeah, you know you want it, you know you need it
It's my Kilo's ding-a-ling, ooh, ding-a-ling
Oh you know you want it, oh you know you need it
