Sometimes me wonder why my brothers and sisters are so jealous
When they know I leave them stunned
And they know I go on and on
And they know that they don't want none (Kilo is the man)
And you don't want none (Kilo is the man)
And you don't want none (Kilo is the man)
And you don't want none

I said me know a kid about me punkital Jah
Me learn a little bit from me Muslim manager
Me go into the studio after each and every day
Me album funk and get'cha and me DJ do not play
He do not play, he do not play
Funky funky DJ from Atlanta GA
Kilo was born in nineteen seventy-tree
And now they come along so he can go to me
He said I had the rhythm and I had a lot of soul
I get up on the stage and then me take control
Me take control, me take control
Jahve has got me money while me taking control
This is the home of the free and the land of the brave
Why oh why do me have to be afraid?
Of a white man, or a black man
Of some light skinny faggot with a real dark ta-a-an?
You're not in my ba-a-and
'Cause I am the man

(Kilo, Kilo)

When me step up on the stage, everybody know me
The K to the I to the L-O and the G
Me keep you out of trouble, we get rhymin' on the double
And me pick the friend like a-Barney Rubble
'Cause he don't wanna battle, what them bred'll bring 'em gun
Because they don't want none, because they don't want none
And you better have on your shoes
Because you're gonna have to run (Why?)
Because, I am little nigga, but that gun they keep a-rollin' (Bo!)
A little cocaine bad for your brain
I got somethin' for you, I'm down in Georgia
Lay your head on me pillow, let me hear you scream
"Ooh I love your ding-a-ling"
MC's, they out of order, got 'em runnin' for the border
Don't come around my posse tryin' to ask them for a photo
Of a key-yah, you not down with me (Kilo is the man)
(Kilo is the man) And you don't want none
(Kilo is the man, Kilo is the man) Buck, and you don't want none
(Kilo is the man) I said me don't want none
(Kilo is the man) I said they don't want none
(Kilo is the man) And they don't want none
(Kilo, Kilo)

Me not afraid of you, me not afraid of you
Come me me tell the truth a-now, everything that you do
And everything you say, just leave me alone
'Cause sticks and stones, they break me bones
But words will never hurt me
And me walk down the street alone
And me walk down the street alone
And a dog (And a dog)
Breakdown!
Me don't care what them white man say
Jesus Christ is a black man
Me don't care what them white man say
Jesus Christ is a black man (Pull me now)
Me don't care, you don't care, we both don't care
Me don't care, you don't care, we both don't care
Me don't care what them white man say, Christ is a black man
Me don't care what them white man say, says a black man
And he don't want none, don't want none
They get-te-dong ya-dong-a-don't want
They get a dong-me-dong-me-dong-dong
