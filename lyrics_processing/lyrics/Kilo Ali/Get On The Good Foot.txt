Yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah

And when I say good foot I really mean good livin'
You never take for granted all the things you're given
From god, don't diss your garbage, you're rewarded
Not hard, you can put it together and take it apart
Have fun but don't forget you gotta stay fit
And if life falls apart you gotta get it fixed
It's your prerogative to do somethin' positive
And never in your life try to do so derogative
Let nobody step on your feet
And if you're standin' in a trap, don't get too deep
Jump out, hop out
Don't be a cop out and leave you in school
Don't be a dropout, get ready for the knockout
Blow to your face, a mind is a terrible thing to waste
Life is so sweet, you better get a taste
Of the good foot

Get on the good foot, come on
Get on the good foot, come on
Get on the good foot, come on
Get on the good foot, come on
Better come around
You might also like
Step by step and feet by feet
I'm on the good foot and I got a good beat
Won't need to take it one step at a time
Give 'em one another for a god damn dime
When you can spread love, that's what I'm thinkin' of
Just because you're on, don't think that you're above
The rest, because you've been blessed with a little success
But here comes the test
If you see your brother down and gonna help him
A-just stompin', a-keep steppin'
Yeah you mighta, but in spite of
You're gonna help him, you're a brother, you're a fighter
Well you're helpin', because your helpable
And you're a big black young intellectual
Just give the man a hand, anybody can
Put him on his feet and let him stand
On the good foot

Get on the good foot
Get on the good foot
Gotta come on, get on the good foot
Get on the good foot
Gotta come on
The good foot, it really means happiness
I gotta be happy, I'm the brother rappin'
It's like when you get your lover, your sister or your mother
Or your brother, even your grandma
Even though you don't like her
The family, it needs to be tighter
Then you find out everything's alright-a
Somethin' like a teen when you gotta take a score
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours
Together we can win it, I know we can win it
No more wars, no lies, no sins
On the good foot

Get on the good foot
Get on the good foot
Get on the good foot
Ha ha ha, get on the good foot

Mama's little baby is now a grown lady
Arm's in the pants, now mama's goin' crazy
I be seein' girls from the richest to the poorest
1992 and these girls so hoarse
I really don't believe it, it's unbelievable
I really can't conceive it, it's unconceivable
I remember her, we played hide and go seek
Now she say "Life is all about the money"
She took the wrong route, I hate to bust her out
She diss another girl, just to get some clout
Oh here she comes, she's tryin' to diss me
Stand back, baby, you smell kind of fishy
You sound kind of stupid, you can't talk to me
But if you need some help, you can walk for me
On the good foot
