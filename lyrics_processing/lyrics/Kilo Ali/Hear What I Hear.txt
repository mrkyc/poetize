Ridin' down the street and I'm just flexin' with the fellas
Them suckers gonna sigh, lookin' mighty jealous
All the girls out to my car because they all know who I am
And if you do not like me, I don't really give a damn
Ridin' deep few I, as the car grooves on
Sippin' off a glass of Don Perion
If this was a court room, you would be my witness
Them suckers don't be like me
'Cause I'm down with Strictly Business
And the business is so strict, it makes you catch a fit
And if your girl says she knows me, I never met the witch
Red is my DJ, a super dope producer
And on the microphone, the K will get much looser
It really feels great flexin' like a star
But the best part about it is the boom in my car

Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
In a car that be boomin' down the state
Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
In a car that be boomin' down the state
You might also like
Now if you got a sister, man, your sister's bumpin' loud
With the super duper zick zack heavy duty sound
I congratulate you, fellas, if you down and you not jealous
LBP got it goin' on, and a damn thing you can tell us
I went to school with your sister, she told you that she knew me
But did she ever tell you that she tried to kick it to me?
No, I didn't think so, go and show me your bank roll
If you not down with Kilo (Then you a zero)

Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
In a car that be boomin' down the state
Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
In a car that be boomin' down the state

My radio's up loud and my speakers almost blown
My amp that keep on tellin' me I got bass overload
But it really doesn't matter, as long as I'm still listenin'
I can get another system, a man of my position
'Cause I'm smooth (Smooth as I can be)
'Cause I'm cool (Cool as I can be)
'Cause I'm down (Down as I can be)
I'm a number one rapper, comin' Kilo G
Make you happy, bring you joy
I'm a little ole bitty country boy
Can't you hear this comin' clear
The big bass drum gonna bust your ear
Just to increase my career
Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
In a car that be boomin' down the state

Ridin' in the projects, all the girls, they like my boom
You can hear my music all the way up in my room
All the little kids they like me, they love to hear me sing
I ride past them wavin', singin' "Cocaine"!
Goin' to the club, you're tryna pull rank
You're talkin about the K, and I started makin' bank
You go and find my manager and try to be his friend
Get out of his face 'fore he crush you with that Benz
To all the DJ's in the club, I'd like to say thanks, G
You're playin' my records, and it's really helpin' me

Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
In a car that be boomin' down the state
Do you hear what I hear?
Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
In a car that be boomin' down the state
And Kilo is a fool, and Kilo is a fool (Say what?)
And Kilo is a, Kilo is a fool-fool-fool

Do you hear what I hear?
Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
In a car that be boomin' down the state

And Kilo is a fool (Say what?)
And Kilo is a fool (Say what?)
And Kilo is a fool, I am a fool-fool-fool
Fool-fool-fool

Do you hear what I hear?
That boom, that boom, ooh I like that boom
In a car that be boomin' down the state
