We in the house, y'all, we in the house, y'all
We ain't never gonna let these suckers take us out, y'all
(It's like this, y'all) It's like that, y'all
(I heard some suckers wanted to battle)
What up with that, y'all (Yeah)

Oh shit, here we go again
Another motherfucker want to put his two cents in
And get a piece of the rock, but I'm rocked up
That's how the last motherfucker got fucked up
You see that I'm small, play you like a ball
Put him in my mix, as though I'm Marley Marl
You ain't high enough, you ain't fly enough
And you don't make enough money to buy enough
Niggas to protect you, cause I'm gonna inject you
With so much Kilo, you're gonna get attached to
Let me see, what can I call it, a Kilo alcoholic
You don't know me but you wanna be me
Why don't you go and get your girl
And buy a ticket to come and see me
Do this like Blutus
And if you wanna have a shootout, I'm a shootist
I told you last album, but I said it too fast
A hard head makes a soft ass
I'm gonna roast you, I'm gonna toast you
I'm gonna grind you, and then I'm gonna post you up
On the wall with the rest of the rotten little rodents
What I do with your blood, that's not important
How come you gonna beat this
When you're scared to meet this
Yo, I know your strategy, yo, I know your weakness
Grab you by your throat, and give your ass a choke
You think you can take me out? Nope!

Excuse me, if you're not afraid of dope
Why don't you use me, and if you like it and want some more
I have a two-ski, I keep my paddle with the doobie
Because it's groovy, I'm so dope that my microphone freezes
Into itty-bitty pieces
Some would like a puzzle, but harder than a puzzle
I'm so dope, sometimes they have to smuggle
Me up on the stage, and keep me in a cage
I'm a fool-fool-fool as I'm-a buy a beige
I'm often imitated, but never duplicated
It's hard to learn to love her when you hate it
Some say it wouldn't work, but the album got released
Now I'm a microphone beast
I'm not trained, but I know right from wrong
Face the wrong way and get your neck sprung
You can take it as a threat with my hands around your neck
I pack my shit, and then I jet to the next town
For the next clown
And if you're acting like a mutt, you belong in a pound
I started young, but I'm not a new jack
I bet y'all motherfuckers didn't know that
Come to my crib, you can see my old Kodak
Pictures, from the fifth grade
Having no idea this would be my trade
A gift from god, damn, I was smart
And you thought I was gonna be a retard
Now I'm on my way to being a big star
Alhamdulillah, put up your defense
Put up the defense, yeah
Put up the defense
Put up the defense
Put up the defense

When it comes to comin' hard
I come hard like an erection
I'm bustin' caps like nuts on fuck niggas that's flexin'
Protection is needed, they can't beat it
Even though you had Michael Jackson on your team
I still succeeded, cause a damage
God damn it, the damage is done by me
The auteur, the motherfuckin' EB
When I caught you at the gas station
I should've smoked your face
Down like the mash nigga, I know ya

We in the house, y'all, we in the house, y'all
And we gon' never let them suckers take us out, y'all
We in the house, y'all, we in the house, y'all
And we gon' never let them suckers take us out, y'all
I'm in the house, yeah I keep it pump
And I can get funky like a skunk
Word to the hoes that I slept with
And the niggas of the old that I crept with
To the kids, they forever gonna like me
And jealous rappers forever gonna try to fight me
A little punk like you try to get some victory
But you ain't gettin' shit off me
You're gonna damn a true, you gonna damage what
You're gonna damage my dick puttin' your teeth on my nuts
