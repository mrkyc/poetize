Ay yo, Red (Yeah)
Pass me the pacing (Can you dig it)
On a piece of paper (Can you dig it)
And get the microphone (Can you dig it)
So we can get it on (Can you dig it)
And make me a beat, like he's gettin' gut
And take the microphone and just blow it up

I take the microphone and I blow it up
'Cause I'm the type of brother that be comin' off
Speakin' weaken rappers that me throwin' off
And after a rather you find his body folded off
The dynamite is there and I'm about to explode
You can feel the fire flamin' down the road
Poppy flexin' this is frontin' what they got
Give me 50 papes 'cause you makin' me hot
You standin' in the crowd 'fore you ran to my limo
Dissin' me and doggin' me out on your demo
But stand back stimmo, let me meet your bimbo
Tearin' up my poster, but I'm still Kilo
Rippin' up cities, tearin' up saloons
The sheriff cannot take me 'cause the brother's a buffoon
This is gettin' bigger than a homeboy battle
Dancin' cowboy that can't move cattle
Sips sap suckers sippin' on a can of soup
Yo, DJ's get the scratch, that brother is no match for
The money, the red one, he has no pity
You made me get mad, here kitty, kitty, kitty
Like the pencil in a paper on-a top of a skyscraper
Throwin' rhymes out the building, tell me how you feelin'
Rhymes like a Trojan, keep it in a-motion
When it hits the ground, explosion
Now the A-Town rush, we gon' rush on all over you
L.G.B. is strictly business, we're a real dope crew
Don't meet me at the battle if you're gonna show up
I take the microphone and blow it up
You might also like
I'ma take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
I take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and just (Blow it up)
Take-a the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
(Blow it up)

Don't get too close to the stage that I'm standin' on
The smoke might just choke ya
Kilo took the puppet, but yo Red, I call the milkster
Creepin' too deep in there, 'til the resent the back when
The fools act fool, we packin' Uzi's and Mac-10's
The clip gets ripped, the barrel is on stage
The mic and taste, dope rhymes like dope fiends
Six in the face when they wanna get real hot
The ant a steel worker, I'm not satisifed until I
Seent a few thrown out, my dad is going on about
The price to get a fix, so when the trash is thrown out
Yeah, what up damn sucker, you suck
Red Money slangin' them dogs, you better duck
Go in town, but told ya was the stompin' ground
Bone does it bein' sold, cess smoked by the pound
Giddy up, giddy up, go for what you know
'Cause we can throw with bullets, a blow for blow
Who's gettin' dropped, dudes bein' popped
Some punk is in the cut yellin' "Chill Red, cool it, stop"
The cops! (Oh)
Here's a bill, Red Money is out a-billigin' out, bro
When I come up, I come off like the clothes on Madonna
Eatin' up rappers like a school of Piranhas
Demolition crew wreck shop, and then we outta there
The naughty boys, you make a lot of noise
As I enter the scene, I see Red Money doin' the bop
Kilo makin' the take, a good Slick J got the push
He's on definitely hangin' with some brothers that I know
And don't forget about C. Manson and C.K
They got the fuse rub
The club's in your neighborhood
The mic, I come to blow it up
So what's up, the police said to "Slow it up"
Damn the city, but tell the people spreadin' lies
But freaks still swarmin' like flies

Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Take the microphone and (Blow it up)
Hold up, before you start your hands form up
Jump and you clap, and keep the system damn blasted
Brick is like grand, every line I kick is slam
A-rappers, I'm lockin' 'em out of the park
Swim from the eel, an eagle bite 'em like a shark
But when I warm up, the crowd begans to swarm up
And with a fair recital they created something vital
Girls, I love to hit 'em, wrap my means of swing
But me for bringin' in the bozack, which is what they fiend
Once I'm up in it, you know the Brick just tore it up
Much like the microphone, grab it, and blow it up

5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
Who threw it up, Red Money and Kilo
Slick J was on the side
And the rest of them folks was just along for the ride
Get off the train 'cause you don't have a ticket
Kilo is the master, so you better get wit' it
Ask me no questions, I have no confessions
In a conversation, ain't nithin'
Pass me the fuse and go pass the news
'Cause Kilo wanna say I got the blow it up blues
So meet me at the battle if you're gonna show up
I take the microphone and, take the microphone and
Take the microphone and, take the microphone and
