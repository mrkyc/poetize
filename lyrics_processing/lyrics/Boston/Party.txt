Oh yeah, well you know I don't get off on working day after day
I wanna have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when it's going my way
And there's nothing like a party when its kicking into gear

I'm getting ready for a party tonight
Yes I'm getting ready to cruise
And if you've got something for me
I've got something for you

Baby, it's a party and nobody cares
What we're doing there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party

I can't believe it when some people say
That it's a sin that way we live to die
You know, there's never been a more natural thing
There's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie

So come on get ready for the time of your life
'Cause I'm getting right in the groove
And if you've got something for me
I've got something for you
You might also like
Baby, it's a party and nobody cares
What we're doing there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party

So come on, oh come on, let's go get down


Get down and party if you need a cue
You're sure to find one in the crowd
Just meet your friends and have a toke or two
In a place where they can never play the music too loud

And get ready for a party tonight
Cause I'm getting right in the groove
And if you've got something for me
I've got something for you
You know what I'm talking about?

Baby, it's a party and nobody cares
What we're doing there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party
Now a man doesn't live on bread alone
He's got to have some loving each and every night
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known
Let's get together honey, it's alright
I said, let's get together honey, it's alright
So come on, let's get together honey, it's alright

Aww, get down
