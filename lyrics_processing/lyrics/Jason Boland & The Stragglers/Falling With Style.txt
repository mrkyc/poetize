You're back on your feet, knock the dust from your jeans
And your soul's on its knees rollin' dice with your dreams
You've got a watch in your pocket keepin' track of the days
And you OD'd on aspirin, but your headache remains

It's gonna be all right in a matter of time
'Cause the dirt is gonna yield and the poem is gonna rhyme
It's gonna be all right, it might take a little while
'Cause flyin' ain't nothin', it's just fallin' with style

When you walk through the valley with shadows to the west
You can pull out your bedroll, lay down and get some rest
And you can pray for the sinners, the most and the least
And be awakened by the sun bein' born in the east

It's gonna be all right in a matter of time
'Cause the dirt is gonna yield and the poem is gonna rhyme
It's gonna be all right, it might take a little while
'Cause flyin' ain't nothin', it's just fallin' with style

You got rope burns on your hands from holdin' on way too tight
But if you let go today they're gonna heal up alright
And your eyes are half closed from starin' down the sun
You got no time for singin' and you're always on the run
You might also like
It's gonna be all right in a matter of time
'Cause the dirt is gonna yield and the poem is gonna rhyme
It's gonna be all right, it might take a little while
'Cause flyin' ain't nothin', it's just fallin' with style

It's gonna be all right in a matter of time
'Cause the dirt is gonna yield and the poem is gonna rhyme
It's gonna be all right, it might take a little while
'Cause flyin' ain't nothin', it's just fallin' with style
