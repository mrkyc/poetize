It's just me and my sister, a dog and a piece of land
My sister's name is Darlene and the dog is called Cheyenne
Our folks both passed away last fall in the fire at the mill
We get by on a garden and whatever we can kill

On the land there stands a cabin that our grandfather built
When I'm away a-huntin' I feel overrun with guilt
'Cause Darlene's all alone except for the dog and awful dreams
She's seven years my younger and I'm only seventeen

We need to fill the smokehouse, winter's comin' on
I know it isn't easy since Mom and Dad been gone
We will keep on growin', two branches of the tree
'Cause hard times are relative when it comes to family

In the mornin' I was gone before the sun had kissed the ridge
Whistlin' the new Jimmy Rodgers tune as I crossed the Blanco Bridge
Two good days of huntin' and an evenin' all alone
I'll quarter up what I take down and pack it all back home

My head up in the clouds, walkin' on uneven ground
My boot slipped out beneath me and I came a-crashin' down
Into the entrance of a cavern, its walls all wet with moss
My rifle up there on the ledge said hope was lookin' lost
You might also like
We need to fill the smokehouse, winter's comin' on
I know it isn't easy since Mom and Dad been gone
We will keep on growin', two branches of the tree
'Cause hard times are relative when it comes to family

Two nights nearly frozen, a head filled up with doubt
No matter how hard I tried, there was no climbin' out
I yelled for help, then prayed the same, then even yelled some prayers
Tears fell at the thought of Darlene with nobody there

My mind began to flutter like the wings of a dove
Could've swore that I was dreamin' when Darlene appeared above
She lowered down a rope, then tied it to a blackjack tree
Cheyenne had found my dragged-rack trail and brought her straight to me

But we need to fill the smokehouse, winter's comin' on
I know it isn't easy since Mom and Dad been gone
But we will keep on growin', two branches of the tree
'Cause hard times are relative when it comes to family

As proud as any father of this fearless little one
Carin' for a homestead while most kids are havin' fun
Smilin' all the way back home, there were no words I could say
