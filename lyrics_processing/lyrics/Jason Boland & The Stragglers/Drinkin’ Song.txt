Jesus has my heart, but whiskey's got my liver
Floatin' through life like a raft on a river
I know what's right and I know what's wrong
I know how to quit but now it's been too long

Just the other day, I was thinkin' to myself
At least I still think to myself
Well everything works, except me of course
I still got some of my health

Well I grit my teeth and I wish
I could stand up and ram my fist
Right through this wall that keeps on keepin' me in
I got sober, now it's over and I'm back to drinkin' again

See the time before I quit
I quit quittin' the very next day
So many times, hell, I lost count
I guess it just works that way

See I forgot how it felt to feel good in the mornin'
Mornin's were for goin' to bed
And I'd roll out the rack, a monkey on my back
I need a drink to ease my head
You might also like
Well I grit my teeth and I wish
I could stand up and ram my fist
Right through this wall that keeps on keepin' me in
I got sober, now it's over and it's back to drinkin' again

See, I'm not sayin' that its the right way
Hell, it's really no way at all
But you know, it seems like I'm never gonna get too tired
Of feelin' ten feet tall

So you may wanna watch what you're doin'
Or better yet you can just watch me
And it's not always entertainin'
But you get what you pay for, and baby it's free

Well I grit my teeth and I wish
I could stand up and ram my fist
Right through this wall that keeps on keepin' me in
I got sober, now it's over and it's back to drinkin' again

Well I grit my teeth and I wish
I could stand up and ram my fist
Right through this wall that keeps on keepin' me in
I got sober, now it's over and it's back to drinkin' again
