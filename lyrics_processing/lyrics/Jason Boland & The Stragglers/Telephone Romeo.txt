We're kept apart and connected by the same stretch of road
And I'm tired of packin' around this heavy load
It started out a stream but then the levee fell
When the rain-maker had some extra seeds to sell

Well I just thought I'd call and see what's goin' on
Did the hill country flatten out since I've been gone?
Are the fields all painted up in red and blue?
Are you thinkin' of me the times I'm thinkin' of you

Well I just wanna drink 'til I'm not thirsty
And I just wanna sleep 'til I'm not tired
I just wanna drive 'til I run out of money
'Cause I don't wanna be no Romeo on the telephone wire

Could we dream up a reason for a rendezvous?
The Yanks are in town and we got nothin' to do
Your neighbors are gone and you're feelin' alone
You can't kiss somebody on the telephone

Did you go out last night and was it just a friend?
Would you care if I showed up there at Six A.M
And drive all day with the top pulled down
We could stay in all night or we could paint the town
You might also like
I just wanna drink 'til I'm not thirsty
And I just wanna sleep 'til I'm not tired
I just wanna drive 'til I run out of money
'Cause I don't wanna be no Romeo on the telephone wire

I guess I better go now, it's gettin' too late
There's a party downstairs and I thought I heard somethin' break
I bid you goodnight and hope to see you soon
Maybe later on this afternoon

I just wanna drink 'til I'm not thirsty
And I just wanna sleep 'til I'm not tired
I just wanna drive 'til I run out of money
'Cause I don't wanna be no Romeo on the telephone wire
