I refuse to spend the rest of my days tryin' to get away from all the things
I did when I knew not what I had done
Oh so young and tired and love was not an item I had bought
Always refused to hear them tell me not to stare into the sun

This pornographic place told me a body was to be feared
And then wanted at the same time, man, if you could figure how
Feared because it was the pathway to the mortal sin
And then wanted 'cause we'll all be dust a few short years from now

It's a broken-hearted world that we inherit
All we're told to do is sit and bear it
For a little while
On the dark and dirty mile

It took awhile at least for me to live enough
'Til I believed in none of what I heard and less than half of what I saw
Mark the days have come and gone, some were lost and some were wrong
Way back home to figure out a place to place it all

'Cause it's a broken-hearted world that we inherit
All we're told to do is sit and bear it
For a little while
On this dark and dirty mile
We're all family here on trial
On the dark and dirty mile
You might also like
Finally I realized that knowledge better make you wise
Or all the knots you learn to tie will leave you in a ball
Helpless as when we were born, threadbare and wholly worn out
Shiverin' as summer gives away to early fall

'Cause it's a broken-hearted world that we inherit
All we're told to do is sit and bear it
For a little while
On this dark and dirty mile
We're all family here on trial
