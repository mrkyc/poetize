Sitting here at the edge of the bed
I rewind all your replies and what you say
Don't deny all of the lies 'cause you misled
Me to believe that I wasn't a good man
(Trouble, Trouble)

That's what it was, that's all it is
It'll be a cold day in hell before I miss
All of the silly shit that led to arguments
It'll be a cold day in hell before I miss
(Trouble, trouble)
That's what you are to me, baby girl
(Trouble, trouble)
That's what you are to me, baby girl
(Trouble, trouble)

When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
(Trouble trouble)
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
Happens every time (Trouble trouble)
You might also like
I can't lie, girl, sometimes I think about you
But not the sweetest memory (but not the sweetest memory)
But not the sweetest memory and that might come true
I just wanna forget about you (Trouble trouble)

That's what it was, it's all it is
It'll be a cold day in hell before I miss
All of the silly shit that led to arguments
It'll be a cold day in hell before I miss
(Trouble trouble)
That's what you are to me, baby girl
(Trouble trouble)
That's what you are to me, baby girl
(Trouble trouble)

When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
(Trouble trouble)
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
Happens every time (Trouble trouble)
Funny how we can get so caught up on the surface (surface, surface)
We forget about what really makes love last (last, last)
Oh yeah, Next time I'll do better, next time I'll read the signs
Next time I'll tell myself slow it down and see her mind
Next time, I won't be so blind to what's inside

When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
(Trouble trouble)
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
When you get lost in just lovin' someone pretty
You'll always find (Trouble trouble)
