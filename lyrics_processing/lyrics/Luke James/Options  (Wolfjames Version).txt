She's a woman that's prone to violence
It used to be something beautiful
Red flights, regardless
And love used to be vehicle
But now there's too much mileage
So please forgive me
Cause I never meant to hurt your daughter
But on the real hand (she)
She's using everything you taught her
And this lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, and a problem
This lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, and a problem
And all I'm tryna say is we got options
Baby, all I'm saying is we got options
Red or green
So what's gon' be?
Cause I never been a fan of running
That's right the pain, but baby, we'll see
But you could never see the future coming
(so, so) Girl, I'm just thinking about our options
Girl, I'm just thinking about our options
Hold on
So far gone, I'm barely breathing
She's holding on, guess she's got her reasons
It really hurts to see what we've become
And that's why I'm leaving
Betrayed all the good we've ever done in one single evening
So please forgive me
Cause I'd never wanna hurt my daughter
But all the real ache, (you)
You hurt more than I thought you could
And this lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, not a problem
This lyric is a miracle
And a blessing, not a problem
I can't believe I said that we had options
I never should've said we had options
Red or green, so what's it gonna be
Cause I never been fan of running
That's right the pain, but baby, we'll see
But you could never see the future coming
So maybe taking life is not an option, (oh no)
Maybe taking life is not an option, (oh no no baby)
Red or green, so what's it gonna be
Cause I never been fan of running, (no no)
That's right, but baby, we'll see
But you could never see the future coming
