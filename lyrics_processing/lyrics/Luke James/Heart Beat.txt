To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh

I can hear it, beat so loud every time you breathe out
We're so connected, music in the bed, but baby you turn it out
Don't you slow it down, the rhythm just right there
I know you feel it, we're only seconds away from where it gonna end

To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(If you listen close, you can hear my heart's every desire)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(My love it strong, it will never grow tired)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(Like the drum within it bleeds)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(Giving me life)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(Can you hear it? Can you feel it?)

Like the rage but it fire baby
It's running deep inside
My body so excited baby
I can barely hold it down
Oh, my loving you
Baby feel the pound knocking you down
(Baby I'm to hold, 'cause I can see the clouds)
Oh baby pour it down
You might also like
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(If you listen close, you can hear my heart's every desire)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(My love it strong, it will never grow tired)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(Like the drum within it bleeds)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(Giving me life)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(Can you hear it? Can you feel it?)

Oh ohhh ohhhh

To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(Can you hear it?)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
(Can you hear it?)
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
To the sound of your (heart beat), ohh
