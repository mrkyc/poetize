I feel it coming on, I feel it getting strong
Getting so hot, in this room
Our bodies intertwine, a different kind of high
Baby our love's in bloom

So sugar, tease me, please me, girl, do what you do
I love the view
I just wanna kiss and touch and feel all over you

Baby, 'cause when you're in these arms of mine
I hold you tight every night
When you're in these arms of mine
I do it right, do what you like
When you're in these arms of mine
I hold you close, never letting go
I'm talking 'bout these arms of mine
Feels so divine in these arms of mine, no

Your lips are soft and wet
Can't wait until I get every breath of you
I feel the power rise, I know what's on your mind baby
Girl, I can feel it too
You might also like
So sugar, tease me, please me, girl, do what you do
You know I love the view
I just wanna kiss and touch and feel all over you (Oh, oh)

Baby, 'cause when you're in these arms of mine
I hold you tight every night
When you're in these arms of mine
I do it right, do what you like
When you're in these arms of mine
I hold you close, never letting go
I'm talking 'bout these arms of mine
Feels so divine in these arms of mine

All over, all over, all over, babe (Ooh-ooh)
All over, all over, all over, babe (All over you)
All over, all over, all over, babe (Driving me crazy)
All over, all over, all over, babe (All over)
All over, all over, all over, babe (All over you)
All over, all over, all over, babe (All over me)
All over, all over, all over, babe (Tell me that you feel it)
All over, all over (Feel it, feel it)

These arms of mine (Oooh)
I hold you tight every night (Hold you tight, baby)
When you're in these arms of mine (Every ni-night)
I do it right (Do it right), do what you like (What you like)
When you're in these arms of mine
I hold you close, never letting go
These arms of mine (Cuddle me my baby)
Feels so divine (Eh-eh) in these arms of mine (Oh)
Give me all your love
(Give me all your love)
Give you all my love
