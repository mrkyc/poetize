Caught in an instance
Seconds of eternity
They're filled with nothing but pleasure
That's what it is girl
When you play this game with me
Now I got your body doing things that you weren't aware you could
Now I dont know alot of things
But I know what I do good
I'm tryna tell ya
I know you've made love before
Of that I'm sure indeed
But you 'ain't made no love girl
'Till you made love to me
Make love to me babe

Temperature rising
Heart rate increasing
Hearing you breathing heavily
Let me explore your body
Every position
