I slept on your side of the bed yesterday
I don't understand why I can't forget you
I know I messed up when I missed your birthday
We both broke the code
Didn't think I'd ever see you go

I wonder if you ever loved me
Cause if you did why be so cold?
I hope you know..

This ain't a heart, it's just an exit wound that just won't close
My brain is scarred each time I let you through
You left a hole
Stole my smile
And all that I've got left of you are these exit wounds
Well, fuck you

You can leave with everything you came with
All that shit I bought for you is stayin' (Well, fuck you)
Everything you are today you made it
Can't believe I fell for all your fiction (Well, fuck you)
You might also like
I'm kinda glad that it's over I've found
A better half I hope that hurts you
I heard you moved back to New Orleans
Somehow we spoke on the phone
Asking me where we went wrong

You wonder if I ever loved you
Cause if I did why be so cold?
I hope you know..

This ain't a heart, it's just an exit wound that just won't close
My brain is scarred each time I let you through
You left a hole
Stole my smile
And all that I've got left of you are these exit wounds

Tried to stitch it up
Had no luck
Keep bleeding out for love

I wonder if you ever loved me
Cause if you did why be so cold?
I hope you know..
