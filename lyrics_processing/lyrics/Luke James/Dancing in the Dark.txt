Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh yeah

Look at who we are
Ain't it wonderful?
Strangers in the dark
Ain't it beautiful?
Let go of what we know
I'm learning more and more, yeah
Let's just keep them off
I know you've got the glow
Oh baby

Cause we're dancing in the dark again, in the dark again
We're dancing in the dark again, in the dark again
And it feels so good, wanna love you down
Dancing in the dark again, in the dark again

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You might also like
Look at where we are
Far from what we know, yeah
I'm reaching for the parts
You're afraid to show
(Show it babe)
Let your love come down
(Let your love, let your love)
Let it overflow
(Flow)
What you're feeling now
Know you're not alone
Not alone

Cause we're dancing in the dark again, in the dark again
We're dancing in the dark again, in the dark again
And it feels so good, wanna love you down
Dancing in the dark again, in the dark again

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh yeah
Cause we're dancing in the dark again, in the dark again
We're dancing in the dark again, in the dark again
And it feels so good, wanna love you down
Dancing in the dark again, in the dark again

Ooh ooh
Dancing in the dark again
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
In the dark again
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
Ooh ooh
Dancing in the dark again
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
In the dark again
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Dancing in the dark again
In the dark again
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
