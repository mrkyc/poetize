So, like I said
It's getting harder for me to control

Another night, another night my ego strikes again, hmm hmm, yeah
Another girl, another unsuspected heart pleasing, mmh
I should have know that these words, they're not real, it's all just pretend
But in her eyes, I'm the perfect gentleman
And that is where the heartbreak begin
But where it ends? Ooh no

Why? (yeah) Do I keep up with myself into this
When I know just how it's all gonna end
Oh, tell me why, some would be so wrong, and feels so right

Just let control, it speaks to me
Guilty pleasure
That girl is strong but I can't tease
Guilty pleasure
'Cause I want it (I want it), and I need it (yeah)
So I'll never stop and find my...
Guilty pleasure

Another day, she wakes me a smile and a kiss, hmm hmm
It's in her voice when she asks how many girls have I made feel like this
Now this is the part where I lie and tell her I'm not that kind of guy
But then she says: "look me in the eye"
Then she says: "I've never felt this way until last night"
Now I'm thinking why

Why? (why) Do I keep up with myself into this
When I know just how it's all gonna end
Oh, tell me why, some would be so wrong, and feels so right
Shit it feels so good baby

Just let control, it speaks to me
Guilty pleasure
That girl is strong, but I can't tease
Guilty pleasure
'Cause I want it (I want it), and I need it (yeah)
So I'll never stop and find my...

She keeps looking at me
She's smiling, I can't...I don't know what I'm supposed to do
I don't understand, think Luke, think...
Why don't you turn around, run away
Save yourself a pain, oh
'Cause you had a fatal start
Can I have that girl? Oh

Just let control, it speaks to me
Guilty pleasure
That girl is strong, but I can't tease
Guilty pleasure
'Cause I want it (I want it), and I need it (lady)
So I'll never stop and find my
