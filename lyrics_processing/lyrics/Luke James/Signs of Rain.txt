Yeah

Sun, shines off your face
Like clouds we lay on, you and me
The stars, they watch in awe, lost in your beauty, so far away
Like air, you breathe me in
I feel you then become one with me
Ohh

And the thunder sounds after lightning strikes
Your body, oh
Girl I see the change
That's the signs of rain

Aha ah, oh oh, oh oh, aha ah
Aha aha aha, oh oh, oh oh, aha ah

Your eyes unleash signs of warning
And skies of moaning, for me
Close out, your world comes to exploding
Begging for me to set you free
Yeah oho
You might also like
And the thunder sounds after lightning strikes
Your body, I see the change, oh, the signs of rain

Feel the rumble, taking over
You can't hold your emotions, feel the climax, let it fall
The signs of rain, you can't ignore
It feels like heaven's opened up it's door
Let it fall, let it fall, the signs of rain

Ah, ah, yeah
Take that, take it, take that, lady, lady, hey there, hey there, ah

And the thunder sounds after lightning strikes
Aha ah, oh oh, oh oh, aha aha aha
And the thunder sounds after lightning strikes
Aha ah, oh oh, oh oh, aha aha aha

Aha ah, oh oh, oh oh, aha ah
Aha aha aha, oh oh, oh oh, aha ah

I could sit here all day next to you
I could lay here and play, ooh, next to you
I could watch you go to sleep right here, next to you
Darling I just wanna be, next to you
Next to you, next to you, next to you
Woh ooho ooho ooho ooh
Wohoh ooho ooho ooho oh
Next to you, the sun and the moon
Next to you, life after death
Next to you, living forever
Next, to you, a child is born
Woohoo oohoo, ooh
