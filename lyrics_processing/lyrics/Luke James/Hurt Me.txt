They say that you're no good
They say you've got me twisted
Cause when I'm in your hood
All we do is bang, bang, bang
They say that we won't last
But I believe just different
They're throwin' broken glass
But we be like bang, bang, bang
CHORUS:
They could say that you're no good for me
That I'm wasting all my energy
But the love you give is what I need
I could walk away, but it's worth the pain
HOOK:
Hurt me baby
Hurt me baby
Work it baby, drive me crazy
Hurt me baby
VERSE 2:
They say that I'm your prey
And that you're my hunter
You're gonna shoot one day
And I'll go bang...
They say that I'm on fire
I guess that you're my flame girl
We can't put out the desire
Not even rain, rain, rain, rain ohh!
