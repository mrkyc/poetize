I have been holding it in, but I am finally losing composure, composure
I have been fighting the dark the my feet keep tumbling over over
Why did you leave when I need you here, here
You packed your bags as I held back the tears

You said that you were coming back soon
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you
I know that you just needed some time
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you
And maybe I am so foolish
For hoping you come back for me
Hoping you come back to me
You said that you were coming back soon
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you
Like a child I stare at the wall, I am so scared and I am learning to cover, cover
Cause you left me unsure, with the weight of the world on my shoulders, shoulders
Why did you leave when I needed you here,here
You packed your bags as I held back the tears
You might also like
You said that you were coming back soon
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you
I know that you just needed some time
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you
And maybe I am so foolish
For hoping you come back for me
Hoping you come back to me

You said that you were coming back soon
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you
OH OH OH OH
Waiting I just keep waiting
OH OH OH OH
Waiting I just keep waiting
Waiting I just keep waiting
Waiting I just keep waiting
OH OH OH OH
Waiting I just keep waiting
OH OH OH OH
Waiting I just keep waiting
Waiting I just keep waiting
OH OH OH OH
Waiting I just keep waiting
Waiting I just keep waiting
You said that you were coming back soon
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you
I know that you just needed some time
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you
And maybe I am so foolish
For hoping you come back for me
Hoping you come back to me
You said that you were coming back soon
But I am still waiting for you
I am waiting for you

Waiting I just keep waiting
Waiting I just keep waiting
Waiting I just keep waiting
Waiting I just keep waiting
