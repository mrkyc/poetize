For so long
Time and time again
I thought that you would be gone
Still, we kept love hangin' on
I guess it's meant to be
That your heart still belongs to me
And now we've stood the test of time
We survived
I asked for hope and a chance
You gave the key to your heart
You used to say that I'm not sincere
I'm gonna prove that you're wrong
I'm never gonna leave your arms
Should've realized before
Your love's worth waiting for
Don't you know that it's
Our love that's burnin'
Burnin' like a flame?
And you know that it's
Our love that's never
Never gonna change
'Cause every time I touch you
You just make me go insane
Don't you know that it's
Our love that's burnin'?
Our love
Burnin' like a flame
You might also likeLike a fantasy in the dark
You were gone
I couldn't say the words
That you wanted to hear
But, baby, now that I see the light
I feel it's burnin' so bright
So let's stop wastin' all this time
Should've seen it all before
Our love's worth waiting for
Don't you know that it's
Our love that's burnin'
Burnin' like a flame?
And you know that it's
Our love that's never
Never gonna change
'Cause every time I touch you
You just make me go insane
Don't you know that it's
Our love that's burnin'?
Our love
Burnin' like a flame
Should've seen it all before
Your love's worth waiting for
Don't you know that it's
Our love that's burnin'
Burnin' like a flame?
And you know that it's
Our love that's never
Never gonna change
And every time I touch you
You just make me go insane
Don't you know that it's
Our love that's burnin'?
Our love
Our love
Burnin' like a flame
(Burnin' like a flame)
Our love
Never gonna change
