Same thing every day
Late at night
There's a place we can go
Where nothin' can stand in our way
Night by night
I can't keep it away
Night by night
Not livin' for the day
Night by night
It's now or never
So, baby, can't you see?
We're livin' night by night
It's just you and me
Livin' night by night
We're livin' night by night
We never see the light of day
So, baby, can't you see?
We're livin' night by night
Yeah, we're livin' it night by night
The night is all that we need
I got a lot, but I wanna have more
Things just haven't been right
I'll show you to my paradise
And let you see the light
You might also likeIt's now or never
Get out of the way
It's now or never
So, baby, can't you see?
We're livin' night by night
It's just you and me
Livin' night by night
We're livin' night by night
We never see the light of day
So, baby, can't you see?
We're livin' night by night
Yeah, we're livin' it night by night
The night is all that we need
When the shadows come
Might be no moon at all
You can never tell
When you're under the spell
The night is all that we need
It's now or never
Get out of the way
It's now or never
So, baby, can't you see?
We're livin' night by night
It's just you and me
Livin' night by night
We're livin' night by night
We never see the light of day
So, baby, can't you see?
We're livin' night by night
It's just you and me
Livin' night by night
We're livin' night by night
We never see the light of day
(Night by night)
We're livin' night by night
Night by night
We're livin' night by night
(Night by night)
We're livin' night by night
(Night by night)
We're livin' night by night
(Night by night)
We're livin' night by night
(Night by night)
