Winter coming
Winter push on
Oh, winter push on
Winter is so long
Winter moves on

The last night on Maudlin Street
Goodbye house, goodbye stairs
I was born here and I was raised here
And I took some stick here

Love at first sight may sound trite
But it's true, you know
I could list the detail of everything you ever wore or said
Or how you stood the day

As we spent the last night on Maudlin Street
"Goodbye house, forever!"
I never stole a happy hour around here

Where the world's ugliest boy
Became what you see
Here I am, the ugliest man
You might also like
The last night on Maudlin Street
And truly I do love you
Oh, truly I do love you

When I sleep with that picture of you framed beside my bed
Oh, it's childish and it's silly, but I think it's you
In my room by the bed
Yes, I told you it was silly

And I know I took strange pills
But I never meant to hurt you
Oh, truly I love you

I came home late one night
Everyone had gone to bed
Nobody stays up for you
I had sixteen stitches all around my head

Oh, the last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
So he drove me home in the van
Complaining, "Women only like me for my mind"
Don't leave your torch behind, a power cut ahead
1972, you know
And so we crept through the park
But no, I cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline for you

But you without clothes?
Oh, I could not keep a straight face
Me without clothes?
Well, a nation turns its back and gags
I'm packed

I am moving house, a half-life disappears today
Every hag waves me on, secretly wishing me gone
Well, I will be soon
Oh I will be soon

There were bad times on Maudlin Street
They took you away in a police car
Dear Inspector, don't you know, don't you care?
Don't you know about love?

Your gran died and your mother died on Maudlin Street
In pain and ashamed, with never time to say those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street, well, it's only bricks and mortar
