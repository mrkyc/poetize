Silken white lacy dress
The bird's chirps soundless
This day should be for me
Yeah this day should be for me
You said that it's still not too late to be forgiven
Can you tell me when I asked for your pardon?

Lu-la, li-lu-la, lu-lu-la
Lu-la, ta-li-lu, li-lu-la
Thousand dreams
Lotus boats upon the waters
Hope they go to somebody kind and sweet
As I sat under the bridge
From a distance
Picturing us as family
Hundred letters
Tiny wings made out of paper
Hope they go to somebody who would love me
I waited in the dark
As I listened to your footsteps
Happy when you were near

Look at me
I'm the wound you tried to hide
Simply by pretending that I don't really hurt
"If we just leave it be, she'll be gone eventually"
Here I am, swollen red
When are you going to take off the cast
Pierce through the skin
Drain out the possibilities that could have been mine

Aeterre mementa

Endless stars
I shall take on your desires
For they needed somebody to complete
I kissed you on the cheeks
And the pigment flaked off
Nothing some magic cannot fix
Nothing I cannot fix
(Fix fix fix fix)
Doesn't matter
(Fix fix fix fix fix)
How much you deem me worthless
I can fix it all
(Fix fix fix fix fix fix)

Would you say it's meaningless?
For me to change
For me to strive to be a better me
Are these my everything?
Are these my everything?
The rivers in red that flow
Throughout my past
Throughout my future to come
The blood given to me by your choices
Am I your anything?
Am I your anything?
Guess I'll never know
Look at me
I'm the wound you tried to hide
Simply by pretending that I don't really hurt
"If we just leave it be, she'll be gone eventually"
Here I am, swollen red
When are you going to take off the cast?
Pierce through the skin
