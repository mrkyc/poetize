Rise and fall
Silver moon tide erased my foot prints
Then I picked up broken scales
Stuck them to my tail

Ah, if love truly makes you blind (Ah)
Then I guess
There is no need (There is no need to see)
I'll trade my eyes so you can see for me

Lu-la-la, lu-la-li-la
Stay with me, you will never be sad
I, I will embrace
Embrace your bubbles, your fluids, and keep you warm
Then I will squeeze out
Squeeze out your germs, your spore, your viruses
I, I will embrace
Embrace your membranes, your bones, and keep you cool
Then I will squeeze out
Squeeze out your evil, your grim, and your woe
Transform myself once and for all
Sink into the tub (Ah, ah)
You might also like
Reborn, reform
Twist my legs to one and mind to none
Tell me, tell me what do you see?
In the mirror that's covered in chalky steam
Touch me, touch me, kiss me to sleep
Cut me open and give me gills so I can breathe
With tweezers and nippers
Trim off my fins and forever I'll be yours
I won't fight or make you cry
(La-la, la-la, la-la-la)
Whatever you need, whenever you need
I'll be by your side
And then I gave you my eyes
To see all the colours
And then I gave you my ears
To hear all the sirens
And then I gave you my heart
To fill in the emptiness in your chest
And then I gave you my brain
So that you can learn to love (Ah)
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
(This heart beating, la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
(Look for her books, now christen the art)
Tell me, tell me what do you see?
In the water that's clinging onto my skin
Cut me, cut me, please make it deep
If I'm covered in scars will you look at me?
Kiss me, kiss me, don't leave me be
I'm a bathtub mermaid (Ah)
I cannot swim but only sing
Just pull the plug
Flush down all our memories
(Flush down, flush down)
