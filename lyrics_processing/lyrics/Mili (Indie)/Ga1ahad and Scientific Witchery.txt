The magical potion of reanimation
Bittersweet cranberry flavored euphoria
Rise from bed, my darling
So I can see you again, so I can kill you again
My brains accelerate
Reassemble you again
(And I'll reassemble you again)

The witches can't be loved
So bravely, I fought
They fell and failed
My lady doesn't wilt
La-ta, lu-li-la, lu-lu-la, lu-li-la
Ta-la-ta, lu-li-la, lu-lu-la, lu-la-li-la
La-ta, lu-li-la, lu-lu-la, lu-li-la
Ta-la-ta, lu-li-la, lu-lu-la, lu-la-li-la

Poisoned sandwich tea party starts now
Eat up, if you're lucky you won't rot
Eat up, it's your turn
Eat till you drop
Eat up, maybe this time you'll be caught
Eat up, fill your stomach till it pops
Eat up, eat it all, just eat it all
'Cause there's no poison after all
You might also like
I've cleared mountains and dungeons
Iron maiden, my lady has spoken
"Ga1ahad, you shall never collapse"
So I charged up my lasers

Ta-li-la, lu-li-la
That makes your bones stronger than steel
Tu-li-la, ta-li-la
That backs up your thoughts to the cloud
Truth or false, it's the logic that dictates it all
Rising edge ticks the clock, stimulates your flip flop
Generate, oscillate, let your blood fill the gates
Multiplex, process, registration
Wipe off your pus, grind down your vitamins
The end justifies the means
Open the book, turn to page six seventeen
Scientific witchery

Someday, I'll conquer the land and have you slayed
Blast away, blast away
Don't be like Lance10t, you are the new upgrade
(I appreciate your thoughts)
(But you've given me too much to tolerate)
I've done so much for you
But you treat me this way
No forgiveness for this endless love
My goddess never looked at me
Finally, our wounds closed
(Our wounds closed)
Turned into purple scabs
Kiss me tenderly, gently, violently

There's no undo and there's no repeat
Can't go back to how we used to be
There's no restart but only proceed
