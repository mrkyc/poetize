Side by side, the lovelier goes up
Reach for the top 'til the bubble pops
Pick a memory, insert to the past
Which one is the sweetest? Save it for the last

If you turn into a table
You must be at the height of my elbows
Odd stubby leg makes you wobbly
You're the only perfect table for me
If you turn into an eggplant
You'll be my purple friend
Scratchy nail marks on your body
You're the only perfect eggplant for me
I'm searching

If you're a cat
A little kitten, you must be bluepoint
Meowing a lot
Hissing a lot but you never purr
If you're a steak
A filet mignon covered in mushroom sauce
Browned on the outside
Medium rare inside
You might also like
If you turn into a flower
You must be the most delicate ever
Even if you bloom just occasionally
You're the only perfect flower for me
If you turn into a human
I'd like all the warmth coming from your hands
Bit of stinky breath, with hair that's unruly
You're the only perfect human for me
I'm searching

If you're a piece
A piece of shit
You must be umm?
What, what's it called?
What's that word again?
"Dope"
If you could stay
Stay the way you are
So I can umm?
Oh what, what's it called?
What's that word again?
"Love"

I'm searching for, searching for you everywhere
I can see you in most everything
I'm searching for, searching for you everywhere
But somehow you can't stop transforming
I'm searching for, searching for, searching for
Searching for, searching for, searching for, ah
I'm searching for, searching for, searching for
My old self that's gone since you have left
Each one of us is a bucket of love
Some of us empty, some of us filled up
Cut us into pieces, break us down to the cell
Merge us back up, we have evolved now

If you turn into a flower
You must be the most delicate ever
Even if you bloom just occasionally
You're the only perfect flower for me
If you turn into a human
I'd like all the warmth coming from your hands
Bit of stinky breath, with hair that's unruly
You're the only perfect human for me
I'm searching

If you're a dog
A little puppy going ruff, ruff, ruff
If you're a fruit
