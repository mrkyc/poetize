First thing I learned, I have to breathe
Secondly, I learned to eat
To chew on red meat, clean my teeth
Before going to sleep
Hello, good morning
I learned to speak, describe what I see
There is me, and there is you
Who knew everything, teach me how to sing
Teach me how to sing, teach me how to sing
Ta-la-la-ta-ta

Covered my skin
With pieces of cotton linen
Conserve the most vulnerable part
Of me for me

My ribs opened up
Made room for beating hearts
Stainless steel happens to my shoulder
Pierces through my rubbery skin
Upgrades me with pair of limbs
My head opened up
Made room for deeper thoughts
Contracting, muscles getting bigger
Under my rubbery skin
I've became what I thought was human
You might also like
My structure expands
Further than you
Allow me to be
An extension of you

Then I learned there are many more delicacies
Tomatoes and cheese
I learned the good and the evil
Learned your boundaries, learned your mortality
You're out of service, out of service
Out of service, out of service
Ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah
Ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah

For the first time you failed and I asked myself
Is there meaning at all?
I know that bodies rot but where are your self
Where are all your thoughts?
I wanted to believe that ghosts are real
That ghosts are real
There are still many things that I want to know
Stories left untold
Does it feel good to love? To hand out your own?
To hand out your own?
Does it feel good to hate? To shelter one's self?
To shelter one's self?
Does it feel good to live? To treasure the now?
To treasure the now?
Does it feel good to die? To live your next life?
To live your next life?

Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta
Ta, ta-ta-ta, ta, ta-ta
Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta
