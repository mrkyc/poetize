You whispered out my name
Woke me back up again
What are these things I see?
Through the slots on my skin
La-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

Deeper, I'm sinking into the slot, the slot at my feet
Pulling me in colours, they make my visions insane
My vision is insane, I'm not the same
Red, blue, and green, they run down my veins
The veins in my brains, dying me deep
You said that blue is life, and you said
You said that red is love, you said that red is love

It is only the first time we meet
But it feels like I've always been with you
A sense of deja vu
And you said that white is truth

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You might also like
Saturate, vermillion, cyan, ebony, burgundy
Silver machinery, staring back at me
Why are my organs trying to escape this broken cage
Then I learned that this pounding can't be love
That it can't be love, that it can't be
Why are we always separated by bulletproof walls
Then I learned that this emptiness could be love
That it could be love, it must be love

Lu-la, lu-la-li-la
Lu-la, lu-la-li-la
Lu-la, lu-la-li-la
You start to sing so deadly and sweet
Lu-la, lu-la-li-la
Lu-la, lu-la-li-la
Lu-la, lu-la-li-la
Magical spell, turn heaven to hell
Light climbs up to my battery cell
Witchery evolves by trial
Aim for dreams, I was your only shot
Despite so, again I failed

I've been waiting for this moment to come
The pink disappears and the black creeps upon
Tu-la-li-la, always the same
Tu-la-li-la, nothing will change
I've been waiting for this moment to come
The green disappears and the purple moves on
Tu-la-li-la, always the same
Tu-la-li-la, unless I change
All the life, ah all the life
Leaking out from the slots on my face
All the love, ah all the love
Leaking out from the slot on my wrist
All the truth, ah all the truth
Leaking out from the slot in my head
All the love, ah all the love
Leaking out from the slot on my chest
Ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta
Ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta
Ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta
