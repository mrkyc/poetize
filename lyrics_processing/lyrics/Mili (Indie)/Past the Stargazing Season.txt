Goodbye, goodbye
Oh, baby, goodbye, goodbye
No matter how many words
We have to define
Goodbye, goodbye
Oh, darling, goodnight, goodnight
No matter how many times
It's just not right

Empty sky
I'm alone with no one nearby
But our memories ignite
The passion that keeps us both alive
Invite us to the beautiful star sight
Our hearts unite

It's your consideration
Your patience, dedication
Devotion, action, forbearance
That keep me flying high
Compassion, reinforcement
Encouragement, conviction
You are the star in my eyes
Acceptance, recognition
Assurance, absolution
Even your existence
Takes the burden off my mind
Allow me to fight by your side
You might also like
I love you so
Oh, baby, my emotions flow
No matter how many failures
How much sorrow
I love you so
My darling, I just love you so
No matter how many times
I have to follow

Pretty sky
I'm stargazing with you nearby
And our memories ignite
The passion that keeps us both alive
Invite us to the beautiful star sight
Our souls unite

She walked through every season
Through winter snow, summer wind
Memories of what happened
Leave me little butterflies
My eyes were closed then open
And captured every moment
Your smiles are always bright
I'm glad you have such fortune
Don't make this an illusion
There are still so many versions
Of the night sky we both liked
I want to stay by your side
On a cloudy night
Just you and I
You're so close by
Yet so far from my life
The way you smile
The way you cry
Oh, baby, there's no such thing
Forever's just a saying
There's nothing I can decide

It's your consideration
Your patience, dedication
Devotion, action, forbearance
That keep me flying high
Compassion, reinforcement
Encouragement, conviction
You are the star in my eyes
Acceptance, recognition
Assurance, absolution
Even your existence
Takes the burden off my mind
Allow me to fight by your side

We've walked through every season
Through winter snow, summer wind
Memories of what happened
Leave me little butterflies
My eyes were closed then open
And captured every moment
Your smiles are always bright
I'm glad you have such fortune
Don't make this an illusion
There are still so many versions
Of the night sky we both liked
