Ooh, hoo, hoo
Ooh, hoo, hoo

"Pick a card, any card!" - that's what he told me
I took it to Rodeo (Oh) and it worked like magic for me
Spa and massage, room at the Bel Age
His & Hers Flying Spurs, automatic garage

Shoot! But I'm charmin', gold charm on a chain
Don't hate me, hate the game (Baby, nana nana)
Shoot! Bet I could wave my wand and like that...
Now we all alone

Just like that, you're mine
Like magic (Magic), magic
With just one wink of an eye
Like magic (Magic), magic
I know I caught you by surprise
Like magic (Magic), magic
Won't be the same after tonight
Like magic (Magic), magic - like magic
You might also like
Ooh hoo hoo (Baby, nana, nana)
Ooh hoo hoo

Now you see, now you don't - I got this trick to show ya
Disappear when he act up on ya, 'fore you know it he'll be right back on ya
Juicy coutures and Nanette Lepores
Tanning beds, snow buffet, valet, lift up the door

Shoot! But I'm charmin', gold charm on a chain (Go, go, go, go, go!)
Don't hate me, hate the game (Baby, nana nana)
Shoot! Bet I could wave my wand and like that...
Now we all alone

Just like that, you're mine
Like magic (Magic), magic
With just one wink of an eye
Like magic (Magic), magic
I know I caught you by surprise
Like magic (Magic), magic
Won't be the same after tonight
Like magic (Magic), magic
Just like that, you're mine
Like magic (Magic), magic
With just one wink of an eye
Like magic (Magic), magic
I know I caught you by surprise
Like magic (Magic), magic
Won't be the same after tonight
Like magic (Magic), magic - like magic
Go, go, go, go, go!
Ooh hoo hoo (Baby, nana, nana)
Go, go, go, go, go!
Ooh hoo hoo
Go, go, go, go, go!
Ooh hoo hoo (Baby, nana, nana)
Go, go, go, go, go!
Ooh hoo hoo

Abracadabra - I've got to have ya
He don't realize what we're doin'
Hypnotized by illusions in the club
Abracadabra - I've got to have ya
Stress your eyes, pay attention
Blow your mind when I get you out the club
When I wave my hand tonight
Make him my man tonight

Shoot! But I'm charmin', gold charm on a chain (Go, go, go, go, go!)
Don't hate me, hate the game (Baby, nana nana)
Shoot! Bet I could wave my wand and like that...
Now we all alone
Just like that, you're mine (Oh)
Like magic (Magic), magic
With just one wink of an eye (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Like magic (Magic), magic
I know I caught you by surprise (Surprise)
Like magic (Magic), magic
Won't be the same after tonight (Tonight)
Like magic (Magic), magic
Just like that, you're mine (You're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
Like magic (Magic), magic
With just one wink of an eye (An eye, an eye, an eye)
Like magic (Magic), magic
I know I caught you by surprise (Surprise, surprise)
Like magic (Magic), magic
Won't be the same after tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Like magic (Magic), magic - like magic

Baby, na-na, na-na
