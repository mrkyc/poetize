Flirt
Flirt

You wanna chill in my Lamborghini?
You wanna look, but you don't wanna see
So what you think of that look in my eyes?
You think it's for you? You think you read minds?
You better watch where you're puttin' those hands
You better stop if you're makin' more plans

'Cause everything you do
Makes you look like a fool

You're lookin' for some dirt
I'm liftin' up my skirt
I'm searchin' for a light under me in my purse
You always think the worst
I just wanna flirt
You found me on my knees
Next thing you're sayin' "tease"
'Cause I'm tryin' to find my phone and my keys
Not your sleaze
My spell is like a curse
I just wanna flirt
You might also like
What part of "no" don't you really understand?
One syllable words, old man
You got a problem with my space?
Get your mug outta my face
'Cause I've had it with your lines
You're pretty damn close to bein' unfine

'Cause everything you do
Makes you look like a fool (Makes you look like a fool)

You're lookin' for some dirt
I'm liftin' up my skirt
I'm searchin' for a light under me in my purse
You always think the worst (You always think the worst)
I just wanna flirt (I just wanna flirt)
You found me on my knees (You found me)
Next thing you're sayin' "tease" (You found me)
I'm trying to find my phone and my keys
Not your sleaze
My spell is like a curse (My spell is like a curse)
I just wanna flirt (I just wanna flirt, oh woah)

I'm just so lucky to be walkin' on a wire
I'm up so high that I can barely feel your fire
You can't touch me, no
That's just a dream
You're lookin' for some dirt
I'm liftin' up my skirt
I'm searchin' for a light under me in my purse
You always think the worst (You always think the worst)
I just wanna flirt (I just wanna flirt)
You found me on my knees (I just wanna flirt)
Next thing you're sayin' "tease" (I just wanna flirt)
I'm trying to find my phone and my keys (I just wanna flirt)
Not your sleaze
My spell is like a curse (Curse)
I just wanna flirt (I just wanna flirt)
