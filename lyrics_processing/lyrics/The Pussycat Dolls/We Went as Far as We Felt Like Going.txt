Here we go
Come on
I dig you, you dig me
I dig you, you dig me

I dig you
You dig me
We went as far as we felt like going
Took a ride
Satisfied
We went as far as we felt like going

Had no restrictions
Stop or go
Just killing time and took it slow
It was completely understood
A one night stand would do us good
We did mmm mama ma mama ma
I shake mmm mama ma mama ma
Oh, how we did it

We went as far as we felt like going
We went as far as we felt like (To my soul)
You might also like
Getting it on
All night long
We went as far as we felt like going
Had a rap
Took a nap
We went as far as we felt like going

The morning came and woke us up
Another kiss
Another cup
You said to call you up sometime
When I got yayas on my mind
I shake ya mmm mama ma mama ma
I shake mmm mama ma mama ma
Oh how we did it, did it

We went as far as we felt like going
We went as far as we felt like going
We went as far as we felt like going
We went as far as we felt like

We can do it
I dig you
You dig me
We can do it
Baby, we can do it
Take the time
Do it right
We can do it baby
Do it tonight
Baby, we can do it
Take the time
Do it right
We can do it baby
Do it tonight
I dig you
You dig me
We went as far as we felt like going
Took a ride
Satisfied
We went as far as we felt like going

Had no restrictions
Stop or go
Just killing time and took it slow
It was completely understood
A one-night stand would do us good
We did mmm mama ma mama ma
Mmm mama ma mama ma
Oh, how we did it

We went as far as we felt like going
We went as far as we felt like going
We went as far as we felt like going
We went as far as we felt like going

I dig you
You dig me
We went as far as we felt like going
Took a ride
Satisfied
As far as we felt like going
We did it all (We went as far as we felt like going)
Said we did it all (We went as far as we felt like going)
We did it all (We went as far as we felt like going)
