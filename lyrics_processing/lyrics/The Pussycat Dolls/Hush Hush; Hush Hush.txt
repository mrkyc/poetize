Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh

I never needed you to be strong
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
I never needed pain, I never needed strain
My love for you was strong enough, you should've known
I never needed you for judgment
I never needed you to question what I spent
I never asked for help, I take care of myself
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me

And it's a little late for conversations
There isn't anything for you to say
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So look at me and listen to me, because

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush, hush, hush, hush
There is no other way, I get the final say, because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush, hush, hush, hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby, hush hush
You might also like
I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words, I never needed hurt
I never needed you to be there every day
I'm sorry for the way I let go
On everything I wanted when you came along
But I ain't never beatin', broken not defeated
I know next to you is not where I belong

And it's a little late for explanations
There isn't anything that you can do
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So you will listen when I say (Baby)

I don't want to stay another minute
I don't want you to say a single word
Hush, hush, hush, hush
There is no other way, I get the final say, because
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush, hush, hush, hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
Baby, hush, hush
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But I spent oh so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
But I grew strong
I learned how to carry on

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah (Hush, hush, hush, hush)
I've already spoken
Our love is broken, baby
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give, but I will survive
I will survive, hey, hey

Hush, hush, hush, hush
There is no other way
I get the final say
I don't want to do this any longer
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say
Hush, hush, hush, hush
I've already spoken, our love is broken
