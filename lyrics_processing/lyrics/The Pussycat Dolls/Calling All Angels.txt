Here I am again
I know you've given me everything
This time is not the same, I can't let this get away
It's so hard to let my guard down
But my instincts tell me I should run away
Searched my whole life and now I found
The answer I needed
(Chorus:)
So I'm calling all angels
I've been lost so long
Shine a light for me
I'm calling all angels
Help me to be strong
Now I'm on my knees
Waiting all my life, just to find someone
Now you gave me the one I need
I know that forever-is all I need to believe
I'm calling all angels
I'm calling all angels
(Verse 2:)
Answered all my prayers
And still I can't see the light
I'm filled with so much fear
From shadows deep inside
You might also likeAnd I would give this world away
To break these chains that refuse to set me free
Losing him will kill my faith, cuz he's every part of me
(Chorus:)
So I'm calling all angels
I've been lost so long
Shine a light for me
I'm calling all angels
Help me to be strong
Now I'm on my knees
Waiting all my life, just to find someone
Now you gave me the one I need
I know that forever- is all I need to believe
I'm calling all angels
I'm calling all angels
(Bridge:)
Dear angel..I come to you, humbly
Im not asking you for love.. but asking you..
To show me how..to love..
(Chorus:)
So I'm calling all angels
I've been lost so long
Shine a light for me
I'm calling all angels
Help me to be strong
Now I'm on my knees
Waiting all my life, just to find someone
Now you gave me the one I need
I know that forever- is all I need to believe
I'm calling all angels
I'm calling all angels
If you're out there, answer my prayer
I'm calling all angels..
(I'm calling all angels)
