PCD, T.O.P, Top of the world (Yeah)

Give me them bright lights, long nights (Uh-uh, come on, uh-yeah)
High rise, over time (The Pussycat Dolls)
Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world, hey

I'm ready for the pressure
The drama and the pleasure
Got my whole life here in front of me
I'm taking over when I hit the streets

Glamour, glitter and gold
Nothing is stopping you, nothing is stopping me
And this frenzy out of control
I'ma stay in pursuit, do what I gotta do
You might also like

High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world, hey

It's like a rollercoaster (Yeah)
One step away, I'm closer (Closer)
I can see it there within' my reach
Won't let the city get on top of me (Hey you)

Glamour, glitter and gold
Nothing is stopping you, nothing is stopping me
And this frenzy out of control
I'ma stay in pursuit, do what I gotta do (Give me them)

Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world, hey
I can do it on my own (Can't stop me)
Make another place my home (Can't slow me down)
The only thing I know (Is I won't fall)
And I have it all

Give me them bright lights, long nights (Oh yeah)
High rise, over time
Work until the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls

Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
