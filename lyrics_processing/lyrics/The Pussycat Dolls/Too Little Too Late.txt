Come with me, stay the night
You say the words, but boy, it don't feel right
What do ya expect me to say (You know it's just too little too late)
You take my hand, and you say you've changed
But boy, you know your begging don't fool me
Because to you it's just a game (You know it's just too little too late)

So let me on down
'Cause time has made me strong
I'm starting to move on
I'm gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know...

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me, you just like the chase
To be real
It doesn't matter anyway
You know it's just too little too late
Yeah, yeah
It's just too little too late
Mmmm

I was young and in love
I gave you everything, but it wasn't enough
And now you wanna communicate (You know it's just too little too late)
Go find someone else
I'm letting you go, I'm loving myself
You got a problem
But don't come asking me for help
'Cause you know...

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me, you just like the chase
To be real
It doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late)

I can love with all of my heart, baby
I know I have so much to give (I have so much to give)
With a player like you, I don't have a prayer
That's no way to live
Ohh, mmm, no
It's just too little too late
Yeah...
It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real
It doesn't matter anyway
You know it's just too little too late
Yeah
You know it's just too little too late
Oh, I can't wait

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
