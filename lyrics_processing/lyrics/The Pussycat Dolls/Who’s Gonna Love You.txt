Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Wait a minute

I'm not dreamgirl, not perfection
Never said I was from Heaven
But baby, I could be the closest that you met
(Y'all ain't ready, it's Nicole!)
I was looking for that someone that don't exist and
And he want some
What you want isn't always what you get
(Let's go)

You want your girl to give advice
But you're always, always right
You want her naughtier than nice
And you don't ever wanna fight
You want her hanging out at home
Even when she's all alone
You want everything, but that's a dream
So tell me
You might also like
Who's gonna love you, baby?
Who's gonna be there for you?
Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do?
Who's gonna hold you down?
Pick you up off the ground?
Who's gonna make your day the way that I do?

Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Wait a minute

The grass is always greener
From where you're standing something's sweeter
You never know just what got until it's gone
But I'm the real thing and that's a good thing
'Cause what I bring is really something
I'm a girl who will never be what she's not

You want your girl to give advice
But you're always, always right
You want her naughtier than nice
And you don't ever wanna fight
You want her hanging out at home (hanging out at home)
Even when she's all alone
You want everything but that's a dream
So tell me (Tell me, tell me)
Who's gonna love you, baby?
Who's gonna be there for you?
Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do?
Who's gonna hold you down?
Pick you up off the ground?
Who's gonna make your day the way that I do?

No one loves you like I love you
No one in the world (Let's go)
No one loves you, like I love you
No one in the world

You want your girl to give advice
But you're always, always right
You want her naughtier than nice
And you don't ever wanna fight
You want her hanging out at home
Even when she's alone
You want everything, but that's a dream
Tell me, tell me

Who's gonna love you, baby?
Who's gonna be there for you?
Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do?
Who's gonna hold you down?
Pick you up off the ground?
Who's gonna make your day the way that I do?
Who's gonna love you, baby? (Love you, baby)
Who's gonna be there for you? (Ohh)
Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do?
Who's gonna hold you down? (Hold you down)
Pick you up off the ground?
(Who's gonna love you?)
Who's gonna make your day the way that I do?
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody

Who's gonna love you, baby? (Love you, baby)
Who's gonna be there for you?
Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do?
Who's gonna hold you down? (Hold you down)
Pick you up off the ground?
