People tried to tell me something
Oh, but I was hearing nothing
When they said you was just playing me
I didn't listen
I didn't want to
You couldn't find a blinder fool

I'm here searching through the wreckage
Wondering why the message never got through
And I found I misplaced all of my faith
How could I put my faith in you?

How many times?
How many lies?
How long you been sneaking?
How long you been creeping around?
How many lies?
How many times?
Were you here deceiving
While I was here believing in you?

I gotta put the blame on myself
Should've known with everyone else
Just knowing they knew you was just bad news
I shoulda walked out (I shoulda walked out)
I shoulda seen clear (I shoulda seen clear)
Glad your sad ass is outta here
You might also like
I've gone and thrown out all the records
All the ones that ever reminded me of you
I've gone and torn up all the pictures
'Cause there was not one shred of truth (No, oh)

How many times? (Tell me, tell me)
How many lies? (How many lies?)
How long you been sneaking?
How long you been creeping around? (Come on and tell me)
How many lies? (Oh)
How many times?
Were you here deceiving
While I was here believing in you?

There were so many times
There were so many lies
I don't know why I stayed
There were so many days
There were so many games
I should've thrown your sad ass out
But now the game is through
I'll never trust in you
I finally got wise
I opened up my eyes your game is over
I've gone and thrown out all the records
All the ones that ever reminded me of you
I've gone and torn up all the pictures (yeah, yeah)
'Cause there was not one shred of truth
No, no, no

How many times? (How many times?)
How many lies?
How long you been sneaking? (Woah, oh)
How long you been creeping around? (Come on and tell me)
How many lies?
How many times?
Were you here deceiving
While I was here believing in you?
How many times? (Tell me)
How many lies?
How long you been sneaking? (How long you been sneaking?)
How long you been creeping around? (Come on and tell me)
How many lies?
How many times?
Were you here deceiving (Were you here deceiving)
While I was here believing in you?

Whoa, oh (Whoa oh)
Oh, oh, oh (No)
Whoa, oh (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh (I opened up my eyes)
Whoa, oh
Ohh
