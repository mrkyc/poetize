Oh, oh, whoa (Ha, ah, ah)
Oh, oh, whoa (Ha)

I see you looking at me
Like I got something that's for you (Woo)
And the way that you stare, don't you dare
'Cause I'm not about to
Just give it all up to you
'Cause there are some things I won't do
And I'm not afraid to tell you I don't ever wanna leave you confused

The more you try, the less I bite
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm into you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger
To make me feel complete, so let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh

Oh, oh, whoa (Ha, ah, ah)
Oh, oh, whoa (Oh; Ah)

You know I got my own life and I bought everything that's in it
So, if you wanna be with me
It ain't all about the bling you bringing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want a love that's for real
And without that, no deal (No)
And, baby, I don't need a hand if it only wants to grab one thing (Oh yeah)

The more you try, the less I bite
And I don't have to think it through (Oh)
You know if I'm feeling you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger
To make me feel complete, so let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey-eh-eh-eh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey-eh-eh-eh

Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (Let it go)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (Hey, yeah)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (No, no, no, no)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (Let it go, yah, baby)
I don't need a, I don't need a man, I don't, a
I don't need a man to get me through
'Cause I'm doin' fine, I feel brand new (Hey yeah)
I don't need a, I don't need a man, I don't, a (Let it go)
I don't need a man to make it through
'Cause I know I'm fine without you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger
To make me feel complete, so let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh
I don't need a man (I'm over you, yeah)
I don't need a man (Oh, I'm over you, oh yeah)
I don't need a man (I'm without you, I'm over you)
