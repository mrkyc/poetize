I guess they know I'm bad (Bad)
I got a problem

Shopaholic's  what they call 'em
My addiction, my prescription
Gimme shoes and give me bags
How much you want?
I need 'em bad

All them girls be checking my bags
While they be biting my swag
I guess they know I'm bad (Bad)

What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (Bad bad)

What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (Bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad
