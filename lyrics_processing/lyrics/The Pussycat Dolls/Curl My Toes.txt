Oh yeah
(I been kinda thinkin' about you...)
Oohoohooh (yeaheah)
(I been kinda thinkin' about you...)
Oh yeah (oh yeah)

Your lips, your mouth, your kiss
Boy, you know what's on my mind
Two hands to touch me with
Feelin' more than butterflies
Put on a slow CD
And throw the pillows on the floor
Come sit right next to me
You know what I'm waiting for

Take me away
I think you know the place that I'm talkin' 'bout
Let's get it straight
Cause boy you need to work it out, yah

You can lay me down on a bed of roses
Hold me close, we can take it slow
Gotta know boy, with only one kiss
Can you curl my toes, oh?
Baby, just a taste and you got me goin'
Places as far as I'm about to go
Gotta know boy, with only one kiss
Can you curl my toes?
You might also like
Want you to take your time
But don't take any more
Just lock your lips with mine
And I'm under your control
You whisper in my ear
Things are really heatin' up
Could spend the whole night here
And it still won't be enough

Take me away
I think you know the place that I'm talkin' 'bout
Let's get it straight
Cause boy you need to work it out, yah

You can lay me down on a bed of roses
Hold me close, we can take it slow
Gotta know boy, with only one kiss
Can you curl my toes, oh?
Baby, just a taste and you got me goin'
Places as far as I'm about to go
Gotta know boy, with only one kiss
Can you curl my toes?
You gotta give me a story
I can talk about when the girls go out
And you don't have to worry
I swear I'll tell them you how you put it down
So I'ma lay back and relax
Cause I know that the night's only 'bout to beginning
Kiss me once twice and I'll know it
If you can curl my toes over again
(And again and again and again and again and again...)
Ooh you

You can lay me down on a bed of roses
Hold me close, we can take it slow (take it slow)
Gotta know boy, with only one kiss
Can you curl my toes, oh? (can you curl my toes, ohoohoh yeah)
Baby, just a taste and you got me goin'
Places as far as I'm about to go (ohoohoohooh)
Gotta know boy, with only one kiss
Can you curl my toes? (you can)
You can lay me down on a bed of roses (oohohoh)
Hold me close, we can take it slow
Gotta know boy, with only one kiss (gotta know boy, with only one kiss)
Can you curl my toes, oh? (can you curl my toes?)
Baby, just a taste and you got me goin' (can you curl my toes?)
Places as far as I'm about to go (baby, can you curl my toes?)
Gotta know boy, with only one kiss
Can you curl my toes?
You're drivin' me crazy (ohohooh)
I love the way that you put it on me (oh yeah yeah)
From the window to the wall
And even all the places in between, yeah (all the places in between)
You're drivin' me crazy (drivin' me crazy)
I love the way that you put it on me (to the wall)
From the window to the wall
And even all the places in between, yeah
Yohohohohohoh
(I been kinda thinkin' about you...)
You're drivin' me crazy, baby, ohohohoh
(I been kinda thinkin' about you...)
