Yeah, the rulers
R.O.B
Pussycats
Got some money
I'm in the club, tossin' money, like nigga, what?

Baby, won't you take me out of this club?
I wanna be with you
Baby, let me take you out of this club
I'll make your dreams come true
Baby, won't you take me out of this club?
I wanna be with you

I smiled enough
I flirted enough
I posed enough
Got freaky enough
Took pictures enough
Conversated enough
I sipped enough
I got enough
I see a cute boy chilling in some jeans and Tims
I think I like him and I just might leave this club with him
And his swagger's tight, I'm feeling the tattoos on him
Make me wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna got with him
You might also like
In VIP like "Hey"
Dissing with my girls like "Hey"
Then I called him over to meet me
I couldn't resist, so sexy
DJ get on the mic
And then he said from the front to the rear
"Y'all ain't gotta go home
But you gotta get the hell up outta here"

Baby, won't you take me out of this club?
I wanna be with you
Baby, let me take you out of this club
I'll make your dreams come true
Baby, won't you take me out of this club?
I wanna be with you

I drank enough
I danced enough
I partied enough
I sweated enough
I started enough
I flossed enough
I snapped enough
Two-stepped enough
Now I done saw someone up in this club
And I like her and I wanna leave this club with her
Ever since the mama broke it down to the floor
I say she ready, she ready, she ready to go, to go
And then I got behind her like "Hey"
She pushed it on me like "Hey"
And she ain't scared to get dirty (Dirty)
Even though she's so purdy (Purdy)
DJ get on the mic
And then he stood from the front to the rear
Ya'll ain't gotta go home
But you gotta get the hell up outta here

Baby, won't you take me out of this club?
I wanna be with you (You, you babe)
Baby, let me take you out of this club
I'll make your dreams come true
Baby, won't you take me out of this club?
I wanna be with you

If you ain't got no money (Take your broke ass home)
And if you ain't got nobody
Then you go be all alone
They call me Mister Jones, aka Polow Da Don
Aka Mister Patron, aka Mister Put On
Yeah, this star right here, something new
I wanna cut you girl, like DJ Clue
Make lo-o-ove to ya, hold up, where the bartender?
Get the girl a drink, give her what she want
I ain't had shit, just acting like I'm drunk
And it works everytime there ain't nothin' wrong with me
And now your girl goin' home with me
Baby, won't you take me out of this club?
I wanna be with you (Boy, I wanna be with you, show me what you do)
Baby, let me take you out of this club
I'll make your dreams come true
Baby, won't you take me out of this club?
I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you, babe)
I wanna be with you, yeah
Baby, let me take you out of this club
I'll make your dreams come true
Baby, take me out of this club (This club, yeah)

I will be, I will be, I will be
