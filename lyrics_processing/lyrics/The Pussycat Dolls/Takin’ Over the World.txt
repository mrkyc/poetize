I'm takin' my time, it's a quarter to three
I'm clicking my heels
('Cause you know we're runnin' the show)
I turn around, he's lookin' at me
And I'm looking at boy
(Because you already know)
Now we don't mess around
You see me with my crew
You love how we get down
(You wanna do it too)
We make a perfect team
And boy, you know it's true
So if your wondering, here's what we gonna do

We'll be buying out the bar, take over the club
I got what you want
So give it up
All my girls are don's, still it ain't enough
Took over the club
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Take over the world, take over the world
Can't get enough
So tonight, we gonna take over the world
Baby, are you rolling with me?
Might wanna be on my team
'Cause tonight we gonna take over the world

Real close, grab my jeans
Start pulling me close, grind on me
Like you want it (Want it)
My body's like a bottle, so I flaunt it
Baby, you need to take me places where them boys hang up
We can move mountains, spend a couple hundred grand tonight
Who's countin'? I ain't told you what it is
So baby, make your move
'Cause when you make your mind, this is what we gonna do

We'll be buying out the bar, take over the club
I got what you want
So give it up
All my girls are don's, still it ain't enough
Took over the club

Take over the world, take over the world
Can't get enough
So tonight, we gonna take over the world
Baby, are you rolling with me?
Might wanna be on my team
'Cause tonight we gonna take over the world

The only thing missing is a miss's by your side
(Baby, I really want you rolling with me I said)
Want it you can get it, boy, just tell me what you like
(Baby, it ain't a problem)
'Cause I get what I need, no, it ain't no thing
Baby, that's how it is, when you rolling with the queen
Don't pay attention to them haters that's behind us
And if they trippin' then tell em that they can find us
We'll be buying out the bar, take over the club
