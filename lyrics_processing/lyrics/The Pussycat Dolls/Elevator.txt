If we can stop fighting each other
Long enough for us to see that, see that, see that
That we are stronger together than separate, babe
You gotta believe that, -lieve that, -lieve that
But you love me today, don't want me around tomorrow
Every time you change your mind
I follow, caught up, all up in your maze and I'm so dizzy, babe
Can't keep going back and forth on these waves
I'm getting sea sick, sea sick, sea sick

Like the way we were before and I wanna know
If we can go back to the days when we was close
Sometimes I think I'm so low
Think you don't want me no more
And I've gotta get up off this see-saw
We're like an elevator

We go up, and we go down, down, down
Like an elevator
We touch the sky then touch the ground, ground, ground
Like an elevator
You're stuck on one while I'm pressing three
Then we end up on the fourth floor
And then we disagree
Then you keep on blamin' me
But I wish that you would see that
I'm just tryna elevate you
Like an elevator
You might also like
Take you higher, t-t-take you higher
That I'm just tryna elevate you
Like an elevator
Take you higher, t-t-take you higher
That I'm just tryna elevate you
Like an elevator

And I feel like we're speaking two different languages
It's hard to read ya, read ya, read ya
But I know if you at least try to make it half way
I swear that I'll meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
But we can't have a conversation without beefing
Yellin' back and forth for no good reason
I won't let you leave and you keep asking me to stay
One of us better figure out what we want
'Cause I'm getting a headache, headache, headache

Like the way we were before and I wanna know
If we can go back to the days when we was close
Sometimes I think I'm so low
Think you don't want me no more
And I've gotta get up off this see-saw
We're like an elevator
We go up, and we go down, down, down
Like an elevator
We touch the sky then touch the ground, ground, ground
Like an elevator
You're stuck on one while I'm pressing three
Then we end up on the fourth floor
And then we disagree
Then you keep on blamin' me
But I wish that you would see that
I'm just tryna elevate you
Like an elevator

Oh, if there's any man who understands what I'm saying
Won't you help me?
Say yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah
Oh, there's gotta be some women who feeling the way I'm feeling
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll take the blame if that'll make this go stop
I'll hold for you if we can make it to the top
But we gotta find a way to break down these walls, baby
I'm waitin' on you, stop waitin' on me
Damn, this elevator!

We go up, and we go down, down, down
Like an elevator
We touch the sky then touch the ground, ground, ground
Like an elevator
You're stuck on one while I'm pressing three
Then we end up on the fourth floor
And then we disagree
Then you keep on blamin' me
But I wish that you would see that
I'm just tryna elevate you
Like an elevator
Take you higher, t-t-take you higher
That I'm just tryna elevate you
Like an elevator
Take you higher, t-t-take you higher
That I'm just tryna elevate you
