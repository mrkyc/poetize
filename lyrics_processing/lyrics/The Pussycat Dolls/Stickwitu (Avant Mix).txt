Mmm... come on

I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breaking up
Throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say (Hey)

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you

Through everything goin' on
We're right here holdin' on to one another
The reason why I love ya
Your charm and personality
I love your sensitivity
Wait... let me take a second
'Cause I'll be your love and essence
Only wanna hear your voice speak
And I feel your body heat
Love every minute of it
You're like the fresh air
When it feels like no one cares
That's why I'm saying, baby...

And now
Ain't nothin else I could need (Nothin' else I could need)
And I'm
I'm singin 'cuz you're still so into me
I got you
We'll be making love endlessly
I'm with you (Baby I'm with you)
Baby you're with me (Baby you're with me)

So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
Baby, talk to me
Cause all I'm here to say
Is that I'll be right here for forever ever and a day, hey
Nobody gonna love me better

Nobody gonna take me higher

You're a shelter in a storm
I'm right here
You're keeping me away from harm
I'm never gonna leave you
You're a song with beautiful words
I'm your song
Something that I never heard
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you (I love you, you're my baby)
My baby

Nobody ever made me feel this way
