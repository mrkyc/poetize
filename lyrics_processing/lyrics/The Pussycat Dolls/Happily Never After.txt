"I don't think I want this anymore"
As she drops the ring to the floor
She says to herself "You've left before
This time you will stay gone, that's for sure"

And he shattered something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be
The time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car

She said "No"
Happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally (Because finally)
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

As she drove away she starts to smile
Realized she hadn't for a while
No destination, she drove for miles
Wonderin' why she stayed in such denial
You might also like
Laughing about the way he shattered something as (Shattered something as)
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway (To the driveway)
She had never gone that far (Never gone that far)
Normally this would be
The time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car

She said "No"
Happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally (Because finally)
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

I'm done, I'm done
Said I'm so done (Said I'm so done, I'm done)
So done, I'm done, I'm done
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Free to be me

She inhales in air she'd never breathed before
The air of no drama, no more
She said "No"
Happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall
Oh, oh, no
Happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally (Because finally)
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall
No
Happily never after
That just ain't for me, because finally (Because finally)
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

Ohh, ohh, ohh
