Say it like you mean it
Say it like you do
She like the way it moves

Say it like you know it
Say it like you know
She like the way it moves

I got eyes on you
You got eyes on me
I got eyes on you
You got eyes on me

Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
'Til you believe
'Til you believe
You're an ace in the hole
An ace in the hole
You ain't been happy for about a year
Cause your expectations are way up here
Shoot low
Shoot low

Get down Mary Ann
You got caught up in a dead man hole
And it's a-back to Bowling Green
With the short lime hair, and the tight blue jeans
Well I ain't the music man
But you thought I was in the marching band
You had eyes like a dame
I curse the lord, but he ain't to blame

Say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it
'Til you believe
'Til you believe
You're an ace in the hole
An ace in the hole
You ain't been happy for about a year
Cause your expectations are way up here
Shoot low
Shoot low

Say it like you mean it, say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it, say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it, say it like you mean it
Say it like you mean it, say it like you mean it
