When the winds would blow hard and the dust would settle low
Storm is coming in so I guess you better get up and go
Back to the lonely deserts westward out of Hillsdale, Arizona
Where the girls will treat you friendly sure but only if you want
Steal a little ride from the riverboat captain tonight
Hey (hey, hey) there Rose
Did you think I'd come all this way in vain
The weather's getting hotter but I start to see the light
And I think I might pull over just to stop here for the night
I see her coming up and I know she won't give me a fight
And so I start to make my move and splash my face up with some water
And she tries to blow me off but then it only makes me hotter
Hey there Rose, can you spare some change for the night
Hey (hey, hey) there Rose
Did you think I'd come all this way in vain
And drive (drive) down to the center of a coal mine town
Wash your face and change your frame of mind
And hard (hard) times, you better stow away your nickels and your dimes
And throw a rope around a big old tree
I see her in the rear view as I start to drive away
While she wipes away the teardrops I thought I heard her say
"I think I'll be shooting you down if you won't be mine"
So I said darling don't you worry I'll be back your way again
When the sun comes 'round the mountains and the moon comes 'round the bend
Just give it a while and everything's gonna be alright
