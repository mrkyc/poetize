She was lovin on his roughneck
She was talkin bout runnin away
While he was puffin on a cigarette
& just thinkin
How am i gonna say goodbye
He said girl you got it good here
You don't need to mess with
A guy going nowhere
She said how's about Texas?
He got up and shook his head
Then said
Ain't ya been listenin
It's never gonna work out
And i think it'd be a good time now
To let me go
You don't need me baby
Stop holdin on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't let me go
He said other than a dreamer
I ain't nothing but a drifter
You could do a lot better
He leaned over and he kissed her
He said you'd got another year of college
And a good momma and a daddy
And me i got 93 dollars and this old '82 Chevy

You don't need me baby
Stop holdin on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't let me go
She said nice try
But you can't hide behind those shades there on your face
See i don't think you're all that tough
I just think you're scared of love
And i think i won't take up that much space
So let me go
Take me with ya baby
It's so cold outside your arms
And we both know that you're not as strong
As you think you are
So let me go take me with ya baby
I belong where you are
We both know I'm so good for you
And it'll only break your heart down the road
If you don't let me go...
