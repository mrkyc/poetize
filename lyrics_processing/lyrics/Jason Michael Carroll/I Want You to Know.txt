Faster than the speed
I'm supposed to drive
Tears falling down my face
And I'm praying he is all right
Running stop sings
Passing cars on double yellow lines
No one to tell me where he is
And whats burning through my mind
I'm sorry for anything I've done to hurt you
And I'm sorry for the ways I made you cry
I'm sorry I miss any chance to tell you
I'm so glad that I have you in my life
So I ran screaming
I have to park the car a mile away
With does who like me
Don't know what happen here today
Try to find him
Seeing others who just got the news
Why did it have to come to this
To see what I have to lose
You might also likeI want you to know how much I love you
And I'm sorry for those times you couldn't tell
I hope you know how much you mean to me
The thought of losing you is leaving hell
Terrify of what I find when I walk into the room
Full of cruz for little lives and dreams big as the moon
I felt to my knees when I hear a voice that I know said:
"Hey daddy here I'm and I'm okay"
With tears fell as I said what I couldn't wait
I'm sorry for anything I've done to hurt you
And I'm sorry for the ways I made you cry
I'm sorry I miss any chance to tell
I'm so glad that I have you in my life
And I want you to know how much I love you
And I'm sorry for those times you couldn't tell
I hope you know how much you mean to me
The thought of losing you is leaving hell
