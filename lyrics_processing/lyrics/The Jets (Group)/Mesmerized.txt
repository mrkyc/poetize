You say you do with hungry eyes
You want me to belong to you
It's in your sighs
You ask me
"What's it gonna be now?"
You want no lies
You're eyes are tender as the apple to my Eden
Your lips taste so right and sweet
You ask me when I'll see you again
You've done the impossible
I'm mesmerized by your love
I'm hypnotized
This is the first time that love's tracked me down
And I've been in love in return
When siding, love is all at known
It's such a shame
Together feeling so alone
I know we're in game
But you have changed my life forever
I'm not the same
Two magic numbers
And a perfect combination
Two sides of a coin are we
Can't turn you back
I'm too far gone
I might as now, you see
You might also likeI'm mesmerized by your love
I'm hypnotized
And now these lovers have for the pair
Love's finally calling my bluff
When I'm dreaming
This one's for real, yeah
Since you're asking me
What do I feel
Mesmerized by your love
I'm hypnotized
And now these lovers have for the pair
Love's finally calling my bluff
You're eyes are tender as the apple to my Eden
You're lips taste so right and sweet
You ask me when I'll see you again
You've done the impossible
I'm mesmerized by your love
I'm hypnotized
This is the first time that love's tracked me down
And I've been in love in return
Mesmerized, yeah
By your love
I'm hypnotized
And now these lovers have for the pair
Love's finally calling my bluff
Mesmerized, ooh
By your love
I'm hypnotized
Girl you know, I love you
This is the first time that love's tracked me down
And I've been in love in return
Mesmerized
By your love
