Have you ever heard of a murderer, bloody murderer
The Hot Boys come one time, how many say murderer
Bloody murderer, Cash Money packing the low iron, low iron

Blah, to your face, hollow tips go chase
Drum rates erase, every day in the face (4 real)

She test me, plenty niggas gone bleed (Yea, yea)
Under the possession of blood and crystal
Hittin' a nigga section with guns, leavin' it foul
Blow out ya, skies you coming back with the guns
Lil bads yell, "Hot!", to the top of my lungs
Same nigga that a hit you set beat you son (4 real)
You know me lil' shorty Miss Cita's son
Lil' Wayne Nigga, Calleon, H-O-T  B-O-Y  U-P-T soldier
Can't stop me, with the bullets I throw, and the K's I tote
And the weed I smoke, and the corners I done sew
Who, you not ready? Uh-uh, not now, not then, not ever
Now, boom, clear the spot, better back off 'fore I blast off
Put my mask on and watch I, I act a dawg

Three steps, shoot, pah! Nigga, we shoot first

Now a nigga was makin' cake rolls by the caseloads
Kept a chopper with a arm fold wherever I go
And I always had to hustle that I could go head
I was snatchin' by the truckloads all in your shit
My mommy used to tell me you gotta slow down
But I didn't wanna hear shit cause I was a clown
Look I done showed you lil' niggas, I done mold you lil' niggas
You besta not play with me cause, look, I done told you lil' niggas
I ain't the one, my nerves bad, I move quick
That was my partner that you killed what's happenin' with you bitch?
I hit him, bam-bam, two to the chest
Bam-bam two to the head, bam, one through the neck
I looked up, now which one of you bitches wanna be next
I picked the case and then I broke through the Jects
Damn them bitches saw me, I hope they don't talk
But if I think they gone talk believe they ain't gon' walk
You see these golds, these diamonds, all these houses, these jewels
They got niggas trying to jack and I'm acting a fucking fool
I know that every day I gotta protect my naps
I know that a nigga waitin' trying to put it in my lap, shoot first
