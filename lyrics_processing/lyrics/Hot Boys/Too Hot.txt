I duck off, cause the law lookin' for B.G
Sayin that I killed a nigga around the club last week
Left the scene ridin' in a big body
So I flipped the script now I'm in a ES3
Playin' by different bitches 'cause my face in the paper
Hoe drove by fore' she could describe me, I got the eraser
I don't discriminate I flip a bitch too
She got to be eliminated, I kill a bitch too
She her hair fixed by my sister she lost she gonna get her
To let me drop her off by this nigga, off the river
She ridin' with me thinkin' that it's cool and shit
She don't think I know that she let her lips loose and shit
I'ma pull over pull her out and pop some slugs in the bitch
And leave her pussy stinkin' 'cause I don't love a bitch
But I was taught comin' up, never trust a bitch
And don't hesitate for a minute to chug the bitch
She was tryin' to get me locked up
It was a must that the ho get popped up
Fuckin with me best believe that I'll cool ya block
Got ya sayin' them Hot Boy niggas too, too hot, too, too hot

What do ya call a nigga that be duckin' the law? (Hot)
What do ya call a nigga that be playin' it raw (Hot)
What do ya call a nigga that don't give a fuck who you are (Hot)
What do ya call a nigga that play it like Escobar (Hot)
