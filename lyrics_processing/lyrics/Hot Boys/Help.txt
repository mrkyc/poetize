Oh and it's Guerilla Warfare time

Look here

Luxury cars on chrome, I play that
Five figure bonds on charges, I'd paid that
Ounces of coke at a young age, look I weighed that
My click done blewed up you know haters, they hate that
Come around me with a bad bitch, you know I'ma take that
Put a chopper in my hand, and watch how quick I sprayed that
Drop a track watch how quick I go and lace that
Cash Money I don't think y'all niggas could really faze that
Beef with me, I don't think you ready to face that
Put money in front of me and watch how quick I chase that
Nigga give me the weed and I'm ready to blaze that
I'ma man and if it's my charge, I gotta take that
Mouth off yo brains and I'ma have to waste that
K bullets burn, you talk and watch you taste that
I'm so large, I gotta phone, the feds can't trace that
You gotta respect I'ma fool, how you love that
