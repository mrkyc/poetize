Verse 1
She can get it, she wit it
She a bad one, toes pigeoned
Ass heavy, mean pair of titties
Thighs so thick sexy witta pair of angelie jolie lips
Damn, you a star, grab yo girls meet me at the bar
And lets do it, freaky language im fluent
Im cuban but my money jewish
Miamis so hot, but i stay cool
Thanks to the ice, on the jewels
Make em believe us just like jesus
Do me a favor tell your man to be easy

Verse 3
MIMS!
If she can get it, then i can give it
In a mercy all go in da civic
Ill break her off like a conjugal visit
Suspended in mid air defy physics
See i live it, she got a gap like bridgette, she get it
Ooh im so vivid, so descriptive
Girls they know how we move bad boy to 08 mike lowrie
From NY to cali
Bank roll, you cannot match ma salary
I run blocks from broadway to bowie
Call me the quicker picker upper like bounty
(Chorus)
Hell yeah, she can get it
She can get it (she can get it)
She can get it (she can get it)
She can get it
Hell yeah, she can get it
She can get it (you can get it)

From da back to da front (she can get it)
Beat it up till its numb (she can get it)
Baby gurl you da bomb
