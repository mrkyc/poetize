Don't make me sit all alone and cry
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
I'm like a fish out of water, a cat in a tree
You don't even wanna talk to me
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
'Cause you won't take me back when I come around
Said you're sorry as she puts me out
I gotta big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
See, I gotta candle and it burns so bright
In my window every night
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
Round every corner there's something I see
Brings me right back how I used to be
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
Yes, you will take back when I come around
Said you're sorry as she puts me out
I gotta big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
It's over, I know it but I can't let go

She went off and left me and it just ain't right
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
Round every corner, there's something I see
Brings me right back how I used to be
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
Yeah, she won't take me back when I come around

Said you're sorry as she puts me out
I gotta big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
