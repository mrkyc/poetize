What the future holds
But I believe my heart knows enough
Though sometimes I'm confused
And I guess I stand to lose
I don't want to risk missing your sweet love
And ooh if I knew
Everything would end soon
I'd still choose to be with you
I can feel your body
Promise me the pleasure
Move me even closer to you
I can read your mind and
I believe it's time too
You don't have to ask
Just promise me this time won't be the last time
Ooh ooh
Promise me forever
Don't just say "whatever"
A broken vow is better than none
Don't dare leave me to feel
As if you were not real
We both know this memory will live on
And ooh if I knew
Everything would end soon
I'd still fall into your love
You might also likeI can feel your body
Promise me the pleasure
Move me even closer to you
I can read your mind and
I believe it's time too
You don't have to ask
Just promise me this time won't be the
Promise me this night won't be the last time baby
Promise me this night won't be the last
Promise me this night won't be the last
Promise me this night won't be the last
And ooh if I knew
Everything would end soon
I'd still choose to be with you
I can feel your body
Promise me the pleasure
Move me even closer to you
I can read your mind and
I believe it's time too
You don't have to ask
Just promise me this time won't be the last
I can feel your body
Promise me the pleasure
Move me even closer to you
I can read your mind and
I believe it's time too
You don't have to ask
Just promise me this time won't be the last time
