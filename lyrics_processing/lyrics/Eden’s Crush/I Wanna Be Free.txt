I know we said we'd be together
In my mind it meant forever
But,Things have changed, it's not the same
How can we go on lovin this way
You say you love me but you really don't
You want to argue and I just won't
It's bad enough I have to come home to
A man who puts me in a real bad mood
(chours)
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
(Verse 2)
It just ain't fair to blame it on you
All these problems that we're going thru
Sometimes it's me who get's you upset
But when it's you, you won't admit it
We try to talk but we misunderstand
So I stay quiet and you get all mad
It's bad enough I have to come home to
A man who puts me in a real bad mood

I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
(Verse 3)
I don't know what i'm gonna do
After all that I did for you
'Try to show you love and stay true
But it seems it still won't do
All your fussing and cussing (uhhuh)
At each other like we're enemies
Goin' against the brains
With nothing but negative energy (whatever)
Not saying
That I ain't got no faults
And im perfect
But all you stressing me
Me stressing you
Tell me is it worth it (please)
On the phone
With your friends
Putting 'em in my business
Why don't you go on Jerry Springer
And get it off the ringer (Alright then)
(chours)
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free from your love
From the pain from the heartache your causing me
I wanna be free from your love
