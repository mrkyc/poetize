Why you have to talk behind my back
Why you tell your friends I'm no good for you
Why you tellin' them you've got someone new
Ooh
Do you think I'm weak
Because you see these tears roll down my cheek
Don't you know it hurts me deep inside
When I hear your friends tellin' all these lies
I can play the games that you're playing with me (playin with me)
You don't wanna try me 'cause baby you'll see (baby you'll see)
I can find somebody who's gonna love me
Who's gonna want me baby (baby)
If you don't love me like you did back then
Or care for me like you did back when
We were first together
You better let me know
And I'll let you go, baby let you go
If you don't love me like you did back then
Or care for me like you did back when
We were first together
You better let me know
And I'll let you go, baby let you go
You might also likeDon't be tellin' me
That I'm just bein silly
Don't say I don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Don't you say you have me all figured out (figured out)
But I can play the games that you're playing with me (playing with me)
You don't wanna try me 'cause baby you'll see (baby you'll see)
I can find somebody who's gonna love me
Who's gonna want me baby (baby)
If you don't love me like you did back then
Or care for me like you did back when
We were first together
You'd better let me know
And I'll let you go, baby let you go
If you don't love me like you did back then (don't love me)
Or care for me like you did back when
We were first together
You'd better let me know
And I'll let you go, baby let you go
All this time I've given you
All the love I ever knew(all i ever knew)
I never thought it would end like this
Baby, my love you're gonna miss, oh
Porque todo mi amor te de
Tu lo has destruido
If you don't love me like you did back then (if you don't love me)
Or care for me like you did back when
We were first together
You'd better let me know
And I'll let you go (let me go), baby let you go
(x3)
If you don't, if you don't, if you don't love me
If you don't, if you don't, if you don't care
If you don't, if you don't, if you don't love me
Let me know, let me know
