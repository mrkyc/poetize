I want to run
Into someone's arms
Lie on a bed of roses
(Nicole)
I, I want to feel
Just like Juliet
I wanna fall in love
I've gotta feeling
(Chorus)
Everybody wants someone to love
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away
Everybody needs a little tenderness
To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to be in love this way
(Nicole)
I know I do (I do)
What about you
Oooh
You might also like(Ivette)
I want to be somebody's baby
I want to cry and still feel beautiful
Maybe I really just wanna be myself
Am I the only one
I've got a feeling
(Chorus)
Everybody wants someone to love
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away
Everybody needs a little tenderness
To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to be in love this way
(Nicole)
I know I do (I do)
What about you
Oooh
See I do
Doesn't everybody wanna give their heart away
I do, doesn't everybody wanna love this way 'cause I do
(Chorus)
Everybody wants someone to love
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away (give their heart away)
Everybody needs a little tenderness (a little tenderness)
To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to (doesn't everybody want to be in love this way)
Be in love this way
(Ana Maria)
I wanna feel like an angel
I want to fly on a beam of moonlight
And I, I wanna see heaven from the inside
I wanna be in love this way
(All)
(everybody wants someone to love)
I wanna feel just like Juliet (what about you)
(everybody wants someone to love)Juliet, Juliet
Everybody needs a little tenderness
To feel understood
To feel passionate(what about you)
