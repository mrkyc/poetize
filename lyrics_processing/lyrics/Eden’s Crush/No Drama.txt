Wondering why i let people make me so crazy
Then i realized it's my fault by being around negativity
Cuz i don't have to know them and they don't have to know me
Everytime i see you you bring me bad news
I'mma let you know that u gotta go
If one day you call me
Think you can dog me
I'mma let you know that u gotta go
If it's something that we talked about
That you go run your mouth about
I'm gonna let you know
If you always bring me down then u gotta go
Oh....
I wanna no i'm gonna
Live life with no drama
I wanna be happy and live life stress free
So i'm gonna live life with no drama
Not gonna let this world get the best of me
There were people in my life
I thought were cool...not true
Cuz it seemed like they just wanted me to lose...they had issues
Then i realized they only hold me down
If i allow them too
So to be happy i'll cut them loose
If that's what i have to do
'
Everytime i see you you give me bad news
I'mma let you know that u gotta go
If one day you call me
Think you can dog me
I'mma let you know that u gotta go
If it's something that we talked about
That you go run your mouth about
I'm gonna let you know
If you always bring me down then u gotta go
Go...
I wanna no i'm gonna
Live life with no drama
I wanna be happy and live life stress free
So i'm gonna live life with no drama
Not gonna let this world get the best of me
Best of me...oh
I just want positive people in my life
Not negative energy hater types
Don't wanna see the type that just might try
And steal my sunshine
I just wanna keep enjoying life
And not let the good times pass me by
I'm gonna try to live my life
With no drama...no drama
I wanna no i'm gonna
Live life with no drama
I wanna be happy and live life stress free
So i'm gonna live life with no drama
Not gonna let this world get the best of me
Best of me best of me
I wanna no i'm gonna
Live life with no drama
I wanna be happy and live life stress free
So i'm gonna live life with no drama
