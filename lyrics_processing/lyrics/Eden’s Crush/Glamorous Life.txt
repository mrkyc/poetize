She wears a long fur coat of mink even in the summer time
Everybody knows from her coy little wink the girls got alot of mind
She's got big thoughts, big dreams and a big brown mercedes sedan
What I think this girl what she really want's is to be in love with a man

She wants to lead (she wants to lead) the Glamorous life
She don't need (don't need) a man's touch
She wants to lead (she wants to lead) the Glamorous life
Without love it ain't much
Uh yeah
She wants to lead the Glamorous life
Without love it ain't much
She wants to lead the Glamorous life
Life, life, life it ain't much

She saw him standing in the section marked
"If you have to ask you can't afford it" lingerie
She threw him bread and said make me
Scream in the dark what could he say
Boys with small talk (small talk)
And small minds (small minds) really don't impress me in bed
She said I need a man's man baby diamonds and fur
Love would only conquer my head

They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to fifty five secret street
They made love (they made love) and by the seventh wave she knew she had
A problem (knew she had a problem). she thought being in love (being in love)
Is real scary mommy only plays around
Love is forever and that's all your life
(all your life )
But love is happening
It's glamorous!
