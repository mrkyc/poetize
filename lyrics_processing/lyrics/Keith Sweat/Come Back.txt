You lied to me baby
Why did you have to lie to me baby
No no no no no no no noo

I don't want nobody but you baby (ooh)
I don't need nobody but you baby (uh huh)
Told me you'll never never never never leave me
And tonight I'm all by myself
I'm all alone, with nobody else
Hoping that you'd come back to me
Sitting here thinking about your pretty face
And you put a smile on mine (miss you girl)
And the thought of you not being here with me is driving me wild

But if I could turn back the hands of time
Things would be some much different, baby
I wouldn't give you a reason to leave like you did, girl
No, no, I would not, baby

Come back
Come back come back
Come back to me baby
To me baby yeah my my baby come back come back to me my lady
