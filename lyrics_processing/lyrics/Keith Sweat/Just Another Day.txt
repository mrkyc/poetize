Yeah (Another day)
Just another day (think about this one)

Laying in my bed I think constant thoughts of me and you
You could never know girl what I'm going through
Everything I see and do reminds me girl when it was me and you
Boy sometimes when I used to make sweet love to you (come on)

Every night I get on my knees an pray (every night)
Hope that you will send you loving back my way, (ooh oh)
But for now girl here alone I lay
Just another day that gone away
Every night I get on my knees an pray (every night)
Hope that you will send you loving back my way, (ooh oh)
But for now girl here alone I lay
Just another day that gone away

Family portraits on the wall, thoughts of love will conquer all (conquers all)
Hope that time will lead, ease all the pain I feel
Can't neglect the love we share (love we share)
I remember girl when you would stay, give me all my body, baby, you told me c'mon
