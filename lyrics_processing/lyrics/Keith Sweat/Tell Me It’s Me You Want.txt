Ooh (tell me it's me you want), whoa
You got to tell me, why don't you tell me, girl
(Tell me) tell me (it's me you want) it's me you want, baby
You know you got to tell me, got to, got to tell me
Why don't you, why don't you tell me, girl
You, you got to tell me, baby
Woah, oh

Hurt your heart a thousand times
Well, now my rhythm, girl, has got no rhyme
You tell me I'm wrong, baby, full of lovin' like I do
Oh, how can I be wrong, baby, when it feels so good to you
I wanna hear you tell me, girl

Tell me it's me you want, baby
Got to tell me, ooh, I want you to tell me
Tell me it's me you want, baby

My love is strong, girl, never weak
And all I wanna do is keep on treatin' you real sweet
Don't stop my love, girl, 'cause I got so much, so much I want to give
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you, girl, as long as I, as long as I live
All you got to do is tell me one thing, tell me
