(Chocolate girl, all I want is you)
You look so dark and lovely standing over there
Now let me ask you a question
Does it taste as good as it looks
Chocolate girl, we can dance all night
I wanna know baby (no)
Let me bring it to you just like this

Let's go to dinner at eight, um
Wine and dine you I just can't wait
Before the night is over
Go to the movies at ten
Take you out when it ends
All I ask is one request
Is she real
