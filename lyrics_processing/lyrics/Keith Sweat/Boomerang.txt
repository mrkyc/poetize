Yeah, I can't stop thinking about you
Last night was crazy
Can we do it again?

Six in the mornin', boy, I'm so hungry
Appetite's callin', starvin' for you
Love me so long, you put it on me (Come here)
Now I can't wait, I need a taste of you
Temperatures rise, your body is fire
So don't make me wait, I need you right here (Here)
So I'm doin' 90 on the highway
I hope you're ready

Got me comin' back for some more of that
Like a boomerang, boomerang, boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang
I don't know how to act (Don't know how to act)
When it bounce like that
You got that boomerang, boomerang, boomerang
Boomerang, boomerang (Come here)

Lay your body right here with me
'Cause you know just what I'm gonna do
I'ma whisper in your ear
And say those freaky things to you
Temperature rise, your body is fire
And I'ma give you all of this love
So come here, baby, let me drive you crazy
I hope you're ready
