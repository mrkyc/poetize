I miss you baby
I miss you girl
Tell me how to get you back
Back in my arms

I was a fool baby, yes I was
For letting you girl, walk out my life
Out of all the others, oh yeah girl
See you the one that held me down right
Sometimes
He don't know what he had until it's gone
Don't make me live a lifetime of hurt, baby
I know I was wrong, would you forgive me, baby?

I miss you girl, some kinda way
Tell me how to get you back
Back in my arms
Tell me what would it take me
You were the best that I ever seen
You were my first, my last, my every day
And girl, I'm missing you like crazy

You were the perfect lady
And I was acting like I didn't have nobody
Who love me, no
And who would put up with all my foolishness, oh no
I would stay out all night long
Knew I was causing you stress, yeah
Girl, I confess, I was so wrong
Don't tell me it's too late for you getting back

There's not a day goes by
I don't think about you
Must have been my stupidity, girl
To think that I could handle being without you

I miss you girl, some kinda way
Tell me how to get you back
Back in my arms
Tell me what would it take me
You were the best that I ever seen
You were my first, my last, my every day
And girl, I'm missing you like crazy

Laying in my bed, reminiscing 'bout my girl
Hoping that another man just ain't holding you tight
Thinking 'bout all the vile things I did to you
Wish you could forgive me, girl, but I don't think you will

I miss you girl, some kinda way
Tell me how to get you back
Back in my arms
Tell me what would it take me
You were the best that I ever seen
You were my first, my last, my every day
