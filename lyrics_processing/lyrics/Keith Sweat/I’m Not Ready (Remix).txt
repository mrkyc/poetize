Um, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
When you walk in the door, lose the clothes
Rest the shoes, candles are lit, I'm chillin' the booze
Kick back, wrap the tight pattened leather on, all black
Showin' off the print of the kit-kat, and it's all fat
Steletos on, six inches, Strings know this the kind of shit
Lift the white flags, I got you
Matter of fact the way I'm writin' this track, I'mma ride you

Baby, we've been freakin' from dusk till dawn
And I'm still not ready to go on
That's the way it flows when it gets real good
Back to back flexin' my manhood
(Oh, baby) Why does it got to be so good
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me hooked
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me shook
(Oh, baby) And I ain't goin' nowhere

I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (Girl, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
I wanna go on and on and on and on
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
I wanna go on and on and on and on
Girl, I'm ready to start over again

This freaky escapade has got me going
It gets better when it keeps on flowin'
I broke you off all night and I'm not tired
Bring your body here and take me higher
(Oh, baby) Why does it got to be so good
(Oh, baby) Don't you know you got me hooked
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me shook
(Oh, baby) And I ain't goin' nowhere

I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (No, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere (I'm not ready, yeah)
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
Girl, I'm ready to start over again
I wanna go on and on and on and on
(I'm ready to go on and on and on, babe)
I'm not ready to end this freaky affair
I wanna go on and on and on and on (On and on)
Girl, I'm ready to start over again

Baby, we've been at it all night long (All night long)
I'm not ready (Yeah) to end it while it's still strong
(While it's still strong, baby)
As I look and see the sunshine (As I look) through the window
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know I should be gone (Should be gone) but I can't let go
(But I can't let go)
Oh, yeah, check it out
As we grind to the rhythm of the high hat
Daddy please give it to me faster
I'mma let you know when I climax
Guarantee to please you, but first I wanted to tease you
Before I was ready to receive you
You say you don't wanna leave me
Well, I don't wanna leave you
Now we broken on ground five
And I don't have a choice, baby, I believe you
Work out, gynecological gymnastics
Ridiculous bedroom tactics
Love you for you, for practice
Talk plenty of shit and I back it
I get it up again and again and again and again
Hot shit flame spitter, many a bitch try to be Strings
But the shoes won't fit em'

I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (See, girl, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere (To go nowhere)
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
(I don't want to get my clothes, no)
Girl, I'm ready to start over again (Girl)
I wanna go on and on and on and on
