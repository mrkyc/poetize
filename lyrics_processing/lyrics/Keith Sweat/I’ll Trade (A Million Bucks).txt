If I go to the club
They just wanna take me home
Just tryin' to have a good time
Just wanna get my drink on
If I go to the mall
They come in the store
I'm just tryin' to chill
Said I'm just tryin' to chill

I don't know if they think
This is the glamorous life
(I don't know if they think this is)
They wanna share the life with me
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
But what's a girl who gave all of her up in the lights
(Oh, lights)
It won't lead to anything
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'll trade a million bucks
For someone's love who don't come with a price
I'll trade in all my cars
For someone who will love me for life
They can take away my platinum plaques
That fame and fortune won't mean a thing
I'll trade a lifetime just to find someone
Who will love me just for me

Gotta change my phone
'Cause they call my crib
Just want some privacy
Just tryin' to live
If I'd have known
It woulda been this way
Woulda found a man a long time ago

Don't get me wrong
I'm still young and I'm not hating but
It's not as easy as it seems (whoa oh)
'Cause I'm not out here looking for a hit and run
I want someone who can love me for me

I'll trade a million bucks
For someone's love who don't come with a price
I'll trade in all my cars
For someone who will love me for life
They can take away my platinum plaques
That fame and fortune won't mean a thing
I'll trade a lifetime just to find someone
Who will love me just for me
I know in love, sometimes you lose
Sometimes it's just not right
And sometimes you win
But even then
You gotta go through it
Gotta go through it
That's why I wish I could find
Someone to share the same thoughts as me
I know they are there
I know they're somewhere
I'll do anything

I'll trade a million bucks
For someone's love who don't come with a price
I'll trade in all my cars
For someone who will love me for life
They can take away my platinum plaques
That fame and fortune won't mean a thing
I'll trade a lifetime just to find someone
