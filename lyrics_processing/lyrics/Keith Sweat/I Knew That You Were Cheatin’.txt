(Did you have to hurt me) What did I do wrong, tell me, girl
To make you wanna give your love away, girl
I wanna know, I got to know, baby
Didn't I give you everything you ever wanted, girl
Wasn't it enough, girl, or was it too much, girl
Oh, I got to know, girl, yeah...hea...yeah...yeah...
I love you, yes, I do, my baby
Baby, do I have to get on my knees and prove it to you, girl
Girl, I knew it, nobody told me
