Baby, I still love you
I still love you baby, baby

Whenever we kiss and make up, girl
I miss you so bad
If I could tell you before, girl
You were the best thing I ever had
Sorry for all the wrong I've done
You were the only one
I need you to hold me, baby, baby
Like you used to, baby
Reminds me one of them thangs, baby

You're just one of them thangs
I'm gonna have to get used to, baby
Used to, baby, used to, baby
You're just something, baby
You're just one of them thangs
I'm gonna have to get used to, baby
Win all back, bring your loving back to me, girl

I think that, baby
On how we used to make love all night long
Now the thought of someone else holding you, kissing you
Loving you, baby is driving me crazy, girl
Just one of them thangs
