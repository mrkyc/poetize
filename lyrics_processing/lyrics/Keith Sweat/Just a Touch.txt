Aw, yeah
Ha, I wanna take you back just like this
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

Makes me shine just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
In my mind baby just a little bit, just a little bit (you got to)
Keep me high baby just a little bit, just a little bit (with just a touch of love)
Can we spend some time (can we spend some time)
Oooh baby baby

Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
