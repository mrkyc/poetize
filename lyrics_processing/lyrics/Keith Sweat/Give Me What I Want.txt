Hey baby I was just hangin out with a few friends you know just kickin it
Then the thought of you just crossed my mind
Just thinkin of you this song came to mind
So, I ask them to sing along to let you know how much I care about you
In case you didn't know their name is Silk and baby you know who I am
I think we'll count it down just like this

1. One we'll have a glass of wine
2. Take a shower together It'll be so fine
3. Together here what I plan to give
Lovin Lovin Kissin Kissin Huggin Huggin

Baby can't you see give me what I want
Give me what I want oh baby (Ooh give it here, give me all your good loving baby)
Give each other the night oh baby (Yea give it to me right right now)
Give me what I want oh baby (ooh I needed I want it I got to have it baby)
Give each other the night oh baby (Yeah I think I'll just let Silk kick it from here)

What is it girl that you want from me (Tell me what it is)
Just ask & baby I will give (I will give)
Together, we got all night long
