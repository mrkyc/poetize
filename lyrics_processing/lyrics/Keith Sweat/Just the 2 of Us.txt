Girl, you know I like it
When you let your hair down
Boy, you know I want ya
To make me feel good
There's nobody like you
In this whole wide world
That's why
It's just the two of us

First time we met
I knew you were the one, oh, yeah
My mind was set
You would be mine before the night was done
Boy, turn the lights down
You are gonna get it, get it (oooh)
Just how you like it
Now for the next round, take a sip of my love (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How does it taste (I want you, baby, baby)

Girl, you know I like it
When you let your hair down
Boy, you know I want ya
To make me feel good
There's nobody like you
In this whole wide world
That's why
It's just the two of us
