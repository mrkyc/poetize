known for freakin' honies on the regular
Well it be me, flossin', talkin' on the cellular
Beatin' up the block with that music pumpin' loud
Landcruising G, peep when I creep, that's my style
The mackadocious player dwellin' straight from the Midwest
A superfreak with a 'F' on my chest
For the things I like to do so come and let me get you wet
And like my man Keith, girl, I'ma make you sweat
So if you really wanna do the freak with me
Let me see you hit your knees and count one, two, three, huh
And I'ma take you to a world full of whipped cream and cherries
Chocolate covered kisses and strawberries
I see you likes to get kinky so tell me what you think, see
Come and play with me like a slinky
Cause I can be the biggest freak if you let me, huh
It's Pretty Russ, that's if you wanna come and sex me

Once upon a time
I really lost my mind
The girl really made me lose control
(When she did the freak with me) Yeah
She knew what to do
Every word I say is true
I'm just a sucker for her love
(When she did the freak with me)
See Keith Sweat LiveGet tickets as low as $114You might also like
(When she sex me up)
Ooh baby, baby
(Made me love her much)
Ooh, you made me love her much
(What am I gonna do?)
What am I gonna do?
(Listen while I tell you)
Listen while I tell each and everyone of you

(When she did the freak, when she did the freak with me)
She really made me loose my mind baby, oh yeah
(When she did the freak, when she did the freak with me)
When she did the freak with me

Now I know just what I want
I don't need a second 
She satisfied me like no one else could
(She satisfied my body baby)
She made me scream and shout
She worked my body out
Now I want the world to know
(When she did the freak with me)
(She made me scream and shout)
I liked everything she did
(Turn my body out)
Ooh, I like it baby
(And now I'm sprung on love)
Now I'm sprung on love
(I can't get enough)
I can't get enough

(When she did the freak, when she did the freak with me)
When she did the freak with me, oh yeah
(When she did the freak, when she did the freak with me)
When she did that freaky thang with me

Now just let me break it on down, I get loose like a gat
When I hit it, oh, I hit it from the back
You besta just pause when I enter the center
I drop the gift, uh, that'll make your kidney shift
Cause Tizone always do what he gotta do
Straight from the Lo' and hitting skins with my friends
Now I don't see nothing wrong with a little creeping
There will be no sleeping, I like to get in deep and
Niggas tryna come and test the T-I-Z
They can't understand that they can't get with me
Cause I be the undisputed heavy knocker
You can ask your momma, she say "Ooh, Tizone's proper"
Stepping through the hood with that gangsta strive
Letting everybody know that I gots to do it right
So uhm, let me break loose from this paragraph
This done changed so prepare for the aftermath
(When she did the freak, when she did the freak with me)
When she did that freak thang with me
(When she did the freak, when she did the freak with me)
I'll never forget the time she did the freak thing with me
(When she did the freak, when she did the freak with me)
When she did the freak with me, oh yeah
