Umm oh no no no no no
(sunshine has gone away)
Didn't have to get like this baby
(No my love, ooh)
Nothing but rainy days
It's over now it's all over now

You want me to act like nothing never happened
Baby I wish I could
But every last situation that arises o honey, remind me how you treated me no good (o no baby)
You told me lies, you, made me cry, now you sigh, why? Why? Why? (Played your self baby)
Why'd you do me wrong?
Now you miss, what we had
Its too late, oh baby
To you I sing this song

Sorry, sorry, baby, it's over now you went for yours, now I'm going for mine
Sorry, sorry, baby, it's over now you went for yours, now I'm going for mine

Oh girl
I was doing my job, o sugar
Doing the best for you and I (it's okay)
And even though
The whole time you was running your own little show
You must have been the star (you sold out baby)
You took it to far
Yea girl
I spend nights all alone
Couldn't reach, you on the phone my baby
(tell me where) tell me where were you
Now you miss, what we had its to late my baby (say you wanna come back) again i sing this song to you
(No no girl its not like that)
