Yo here we go
Left Eye flow
(Yeah, what's up?)

Baby, you can skinny dip in my left lip, sip a little cat nip
Eat my punanna, monanna and the banana split
Get a little top notch, play somebody hopscotch
Watch, as I'm plannin my landin on my man's crotch (Uh huh)
Now there's a clue in pursuin' what I'm doin'
I wouldn't want to ruin, you and who you knew
But as I'm rollin through your exes with my triple O's
I'm yellin tic-tac-toe from the waist below
Yo, you say tomah-toes, and I say tomatoes
So pick up on my lingo as you lick up on these tatas (Flat out)
Me and my kitty cat is wearing a hat to the throne
So, baby take us to the end zone
I'm catching 80 in my shady to the top nickel
I'm the lady going crazy on your popsicle
And as we come a little closer to the end of the game
You know I'm taking all the sweat out your name
Jam

Ain't nothing but my jam
How do you like it?
Don't you want to jam?
