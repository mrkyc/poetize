If you want me to knock you out
And show what I'm about
Then hear what I am saying
I know that you've been there before
You say you know the score
But that's not how I'm playing

Freedom is water for my leaves
And love is the sun
You won't see me beggin' on my knees
But you're still the one

Let me come and let me go
'Cause I want you to know
That I will never leave you
If you never let me down
I'll always be around
Let me come and let me go

To keep your foot inside the door
And make me give you more
You got to learn to play me
Baby, don't cover up my eyes
And count on a surprise
That's not the way to tame me
You might also like
Freedom is water for my leaves
And love is the sun (Let me come and let me go)
You won't see me beggin' on my knees
But you're still the one

Let me come and let me go
'Cause I want you to know
That I will never leave you
If you never let me down
I'll always be around
Let me come and let me go
Let me come and let me go
'Cause I want you to know
That I will never leave you
If you never let me down
I'll always be around
Let me come and let me go
Let me come and let me go

You won't see me beggin' on my knees
But you're still the one

Let me come and let me go
'Cause I want you to know
That I will never leave you
If you never let me down
I'll always be around
Let me come and let me go
Let me come and let me go
'Cause I want you to know
That I will never leave you
If you never let me down
I'll always be around
