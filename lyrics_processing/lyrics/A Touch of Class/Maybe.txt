She takes the train on Monday
She's thinkin' maybe one day
Leaving town without a goodbye
She wants to be so much
And she tries so hard to touch
The life that keeps on passing her by

She would work from nine to five
Trying to keep herself alive
Not remembering to see
All the things she could be
All the things she could be
And she's always saying

Maybe yes and maybe no
Maybe I'm just a fool with nowhere to go
Maybe this time I'll cut the deal
Maybe I will make it if I did it for real
I did it for real

He walks into the room
And he smells the sweet perfume
The girl that he's been wanting to call
He wants to talk to her so
Very badly but he thinks
That she don't know it at all
You might also like
He was dreaming nine to five
Trying to keep his hopes alive
Believing that one day she'd see
All the things he could be
All the things he could be
And he's always saying

Maybe yes and maybe no
Maybe I'm just a fool with nowhere to go (Nowhere to go)
Maybe this time I'll cut the deal
Maybe I will make it if I did it for real (Oh, maybe yes)
I did it for real

Maybe my inhibitions keep me at bay
And all I need to do is set them free
Maybe my heart is takin' over my head
And what is meant to be will just never be
Never be, yeah

Maybe yes and (Maybe yes) maybe no
(Maybe no) maybe I'm just a fool with nowhere to go (Nowhere to go)
(Nowhere to go) maybe this time I'll cut the deal (Cut the deal)
Maybe I will make it if I did it for real (I did it for real)
I did it for real
Maybe yes and maybe no
(Maybe no) maybe I'm just a fool with nowhere to go (Yeah)
Maybe this time I'll cut the deal (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe I will make it if I did it for real (Yeah, yeah, I did it for real)
