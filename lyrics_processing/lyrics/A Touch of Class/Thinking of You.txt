Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
Whenever I'm blue, I'm thinking of you

No matter how I try, I don't find a reason why
Believe me, it's no lie
I always have you on my mind
No matter what I see, guess where I wanna be
Love is the answer I will find

Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
Whenever I'm blue, I'm thinking of you (Thinking of you)

No matter where I go
This is the only show
I'd like to be a part
Come on and take my heart
No matter where you are
Baby I can't be far
'Cause I'll be with you all the time (Thinking of you)
Think about you all the time
You might also like
This feelin' deep inside
When you're right by my side
I'll always be with you
Believe me, this is true
Whenever we're apart
You're deep within my heart
'Cause you'll be with me all the time

Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
Whenever I'm blue, I'm thinking of you (Thinking of you)

No matter where I go (Where I go)
This is the only show (I'm wishing)
I'd like to be a part
Come on and take my heart (My heart)
No matter where you are
Baby, I can't be far
'Cause I'll be with you all the time, the time

Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
Whenever I'm blue, I'm thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
Whenever I'm blue, I'm thinking of you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
