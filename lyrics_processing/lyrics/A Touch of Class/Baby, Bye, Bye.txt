You say, you can't resist me
You say, you want ment don't come around me
Don't try to tease me
You think, your love can drive me crazy
You think, I be your baby, don't fool me
I know what you're thinking

I swear, I love you honey
It's true, it's not just lying
Cause when I look in to your eyes
I feel hypnotized
Ahiaia ...

You can call me baby, baby bye bye
Bye bye
I won't be by your side
You can call me honey, honey bye bye
Bye bye
It's time to say goodbye
I just wanna have fun, take it deep in the sun
