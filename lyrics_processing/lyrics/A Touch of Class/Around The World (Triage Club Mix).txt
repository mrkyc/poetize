Kisses of the sun (Kisses of the sun) Kisses of the sun
The kisses of the sun were sweet, I didn't blink
I let it in my eyes, like an exotic dream
The radio playing songs that I have never heard
I don't know what to say, oh, not another word
Just la la la la la
It goes around the world, just la la la la la
It's all around the world, just la la la la la
And everybody's singing, la la la la la
And now the bells are ringing, la la la la la la la la....
Inside an empty room, my inspiration flows
Now wait to hear the tune
Around my head it goes, the magic melody
You want to sing with me, just la la la la la
The music is the key
And now the night is gone, still it goes on and on
So deep inside of me
I long to set it free, I don't know what to do
Just can't explain to you, I don't know what to say
Oh, not another word
