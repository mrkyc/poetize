I'm dreaming about you
I'm thinking about your smile
When you were mine
I still can remember
Those moments so tender when
We had just each other

Looking back I 'll cherish forever
Everything that we shared together
Please don't let it go

Why can't we touch the sky
The way we use do you and I
Why can't we learn to find
Answers to what we feel inside
(Take my hand)
Don't look back (Don't look back)
Just try to understand
Tomorrow another sun will shine
And a new day will bring love one more time

The picture is fading
So long I have been waiting now
For you to call
I know it's not easy
But do you believe one day
Time will heal our sorrow
You might also like
Even when the wind is blowing stronger
And it seems no one cares any longer
I won't let you fall

Why can't we touch the sky (Oooh)
The way we use do you and I
Why can't we learn to find
Answers to what we feel inside (Answers to what we feel inside)
(Take my hand)
Don't look back (Don't look back)
Just try to understand
Tomorrow another sun will shine
And a new day will bring love one more time

All that I have and all that I do (Ah ah ah ah)
It's nothing against the love I get from you (Ah ah ah ah)
You make me feel hole when im so far away
So promise you 'll stay
In my arms and tonight
We'll touch the sky ooh

Why can't we touch the sky (Touch the sky)
The way we used to you and I (You and I)
Why can't we learn to find (Learn to find)
Answers to what we feel inside
Take my hand (Take my hand)
Don't look back (Dont look back)
Just try to understand
Tomorrow another sun will shine (Tomorrow another sun will shine)
And a new day will bring love
