You were always mine at school
But you would always play it cool
So I played along, and I was always strong
'Cause I knew there'd come a day
When you would be my come what may
So I played along, and all your friends were wrong

Everybody gets a wish
Make your dream come true
Then I know that I get mine
And maybe it's you

I'm gonna make you mine, till the end of all time
I'm gonna make you mine forever
I'm gonna make you mine, gonna give you a sign
I'm gonna make you mine forever
I'm gonna make you mine, till the end of all time
I'm gonna make you mine forever
I'm gonna make you mine, gonna give you a sign
I'm gonna make you mine forever

I'll be waiting patiently
So save the last dance just for me
'Cause I need you now
Let me show you how
You might also like
I have seen it all before
It's misunderstood
If all is fair in love and war
Then why does it hurt so good?

I'm gonna make you mine, till the end of all time
I'm gonna make you mine forever
I'm gonna make you mine, gonna give you a sign
I'm gonna make you mine forever
I'm gonna make you mine, till the end of all time
I'm gonna make you mine forever
I'm gonna make you mine, gonna give you a sign
I'm gonna make you mine forever

I have loved you from the start
You knew that I would
If love is really all so bad
Then why does it hurt so good?

I'm gonna make you mine, till the end of all time
I'm gonna make you mine forever
I'm gonna make you mine, gonna give you a sign
I'm gonna make you mine forever
(I have loved you from the start

I'm gonna make you mine, till the end of all time
I'm gonna make you mine forever
