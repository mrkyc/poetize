Set me free
Set me free

Stop tearing up my heart
Tearing me apart
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Can't break your heart
Set me free

I see when you're driving along the highway
If love like that is shining in your eyes
I remember everything you have told me
Come on (Come on, come on,  come on)

Leave me all alone
Why don't you go on home
So you don't know how happy I will be
I don't need your love
I don't want your love
So come on and set me free

If you never wanted to feel my lovin'
Then let me just keep walking on my way
Do you ever think you can change your love life
Your life
Now is the best time to leave it all behind
You really want to make me feel so blue
I don't need your love
I don't want your love
So come on and set me free
