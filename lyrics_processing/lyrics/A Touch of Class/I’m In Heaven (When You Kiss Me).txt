I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Show me how you miss me
Take me with you back to Wonderland
I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Show me how you miss me
Take me with you back to Wonderland

You capture me with a stare
I'll follow you anywhere
You lead me into temptation
I guess you need to enjoy
I'm like a kid with a toy
I'm losing my concentration

One kiss from you and I'm on fire
Your touch is all I desire
One look and you take me higher
You know I couldn't resist
Yeah, I miss every time I'm with you
Every time that we kiss

I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I go crazy when you kiss me
Show me how you miss me
Take me with you back to Wonderland
You know I couldn't resist
Yeah, I miss every time I'm with you
Every time that we kiss
You might also like
I dream of you every night
Feels like I'm losing my mind
The feelin's just getting stronger
My head is spinnin' around
You play with me but I'm bound
I can't resist any longer

One kiss from you and I'm on fire
Your touch is all I desire
One look and you take me higher
You know I couldn't resist
Yeah, I miss every time I'm with you
Every time that we kiss

I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I go crazy when you kiss me
Show me how you miss me
Take me with you back to Wonderland
You know I couldn't resist
Yeah, I miss every time I'm with you
Every time that we kiss
You know that I'm hypnotized
Each time I look in your eyes
You know I couldn't disguise
And I couldn't resist every time that we kiss

I'm in, I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland

I'm in, I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
Ooh, it's heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I go crazy when you kiss me
Baby, don't resist me
Take me with you back to Wonderland
You know that I'm hypnotized by your eyes
And I just can't resist
Every time that we kiss

You know that I'm hypnotized by your eyes
And I just can't resist
Every time that we kiss
