I'm on a mission in space
Wondering what you're up to
Thinking of you
Wish you were here by my side
'cause I'm feeling lonely you're the only one

I'm setting my engine in reverse
I'm done with the universe
You'll never believe what I have seen
I've been...

Traveling through space light years away
Into all the worlds in the unknown
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
There's no place like home
Til the day we meet I count the days
I am missing you feel so alone
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
There's no place like home
There is no place like home

I am surrounded by stars
I can see them falling whom is calling
Hope you are waiting for me
Are you feeling lonely you're the only one
You might also like
I'm setting my engine in reverse
I'm done with the universe
You'll never believe what I have seen
I've been...

Traveling through space light years away
Into all the worlds in the unknown
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
There's no place like home
Til the day we meet I count the days
I am missing you feel so alone
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
There's no place like home
There is no place like home
There is no place like home
There is no place like home

I'm on a mission in space
Wondering what you're up to
Thinking of you
Oh I wish you were here by my side
Now...
Traveling through space light years away
Into all the worlds in the unknown
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
There's no place like home
Til the day we meet I count the days
I am missing you feel so alone
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
There's no place like home
Traveling through space light years away
Into all the worlds in the unknown
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
There's no place like home
Til the day we meet I count the days
I am missing you feel so alone
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
Traveling through space light years away
Into all the worlds in the unknown
Heading back to Earth I'm on my way
There's no place like home
There is no place like home
There is no place like home
There is no place like home
There is no place like home
