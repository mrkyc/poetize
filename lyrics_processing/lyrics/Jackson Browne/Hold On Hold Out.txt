Hold on hold out, keep a hold on strong
The money's in and the bets are down
You won't hold out long
They say you'll fall in no time at all
But you know they're wrong
They've known it all along

Yeah, hold on hold out, keep a hold on still
If you don't see what your love is worth
No one ever will
You've done your time on the bottom line
And it ain't no thrill
There's got to be something more
Keep a hold on still
You know what it is you're waiting for
Now you just hold on
Hold on hold out, hold on

Give up your heart and you lose your way
Trusting another to feel that way
Give up your heart and you find yourself
Living for something in somebody else
Sometimes you wonder what happens to love
Sometimes the touch of a friend is enough
Hold a place for the human race
Keep it open wide
Give it time to fall or climb
But let the time decide
Sometimes you wonder what's in this for you
But you wait, and you see
'Cause it's all you can do
Just to hold on
Hold on hold out (Hold on)
You might also like
For the countless souls beaten by their goals
Keep a hold on now
And the ones betrayed by the deals they made
Keep a hold (Keep a hold, keep a hold on)
If you hold your ground it'll turn around
Keep a hold somehow
Hold on hold out, keep a hold on tight
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Wake up and turn on the light
You fight, and you're right (Tonight's the night)
It's gonna take all your might

You're a hold out
Well I'm a hold out too
But it took me all this time to figure out
Something you already knew
Will love be true? Can it pull you through?
How long? How strong?
Some things depend on you
See, I always figured I was gonna to meet somebody here
(sung)
And I don't know why
Why should love suddenly come down and just sweep me away?
I wanna fly
But there's so many things in my way
(spoken)
Anyway
I guess you wouldn't know unless I told you
But
I love you
Well just look at yourself
I mean, what else would I do?
Hold on (Hold out)
Keep a hold on
Hold on (Hold out)
Keep a hold on
Hold on (Hold on, hold on)
Keep a hold on
Hold on (Hold out)
