It's been a long time since I watched these lights alone
I look around my life tonight and you are gone
I might have done something to keep you if I'd known
How unhappy you had become
While I was dreaming of you
With my heart in your hands
And I was following though
With my beautiful plans

Yeah now I'm rolling down this Canyon Drive
With your laughter in my head
I'm gonna have to block it out somehow to survive
'Cause those dreams are dead
And I'm alive

I want to go where I will never hear your name
I want to lose my sorrow and be free again
And I know I've been insane
When I think of places I could have been
But I was dreaming of you
With my heart in your hands
And I was following through
With my beautiful plans
You might also like
Standing here by the highway side
Watching these trucks blow by
Inches from my face
Yeah thinking 'bout the time I've wasted
(Dreaming of you, dreaming of you)
And the pleasure we once tasted
(Dreaming of you, dreaming of you)
Looking up and down this road
(Following through, following through)
I've been here before
(Following you, following you, following you)
Can't be here no more
(Dreaming of you, dreaming of you, dreaming of you)

Yeah now I'm rolling down California Five
With your laughter in my head
I'm gonna have to block it out somehow to survive
'Cause those dreams are dead
And I'm alive
Yeah baby I'm alive
Yeah I'm alive

Hey look at the way I believed in you and loved you all these years
Now you could fill a swimming pool with all my salty tears
You could have told me what was in your heart, but baby you lied
And I thought that it would kill me
But I'm alive
Yeah I'm alive
Yeah I'm alive
