You hit my sensors like a Kalman filter
Thrust your Robustness, as Markov I quiver
We're going to call it Frenot-Serret frame
Knock my vector off its axis right back into your aim
My heart has fallen into Cartesian
Can't reference past your eyes
In love with our Kinematics
Infinitely described intimately parametrized

This attraction got me breaking the magnetometer
Be willing to accept it
On a Kelvin scale through the roof you're my thermometer
Go ahead we are respected
I'm Andrea Pearson-Haas I'm the Chaos Boss

You got me Oxytocin-navigation feeling so complex
Like a method path localization following to sex
Kissing you so scalar multiplication in depth
Kanade-Lucas tracker analyzation last breath
If I had an obstacle not to collide
It would be these emotions I have held inside
Meet me at equilibrium Lynapunov function
From planetary to matrices we are an empire conjunction
You might also like
This attraction got me breaking the magnetometer
Be willing to accept it
On a Kelvin scale through the roof you're my thermometer
Go ahead we are respected
I'm Andrea Pearson-Haas I'm the Chaos Boss

When I'm thinking of you its absurd for words
We skin to skin naked in chaos never at a loss
Like a Routh-Hurwits
You satisfy me completely in time
Imprisoned by your Brockett's
If Jacobian was a crime
Being on top of your erection
You are my therapeutic misconception
It was all of illegal to love you so hypocritical
But I love you I love us it's my floweth taken literal

To be on your Bezier I deserve
Put me on your Lissajous curve
We most intuitive almost lucid touch my every nerve
Sequentially I suffer from a vision between our velocity position
I am continuously discrete over such a decision
Gram-Schmidt me in dimension and define inner ambition
An initial prediction for the differential equation precision
Desirable condition you fall asleep inside of me
Got me exhilarant into Euclidean homography
In a matrix of Epipolar Geometry
I can't shake you from my dreams
It comes in awakened fantasy extremes
Can't get your images streamed out of my head
I miss being your bed
I don't know what's wrong with me
This attraction got me breaking the magnetometer
Be willing to accept it
On a Kelvin scale through the roof you're my thermometer
Go ahead we are respected
