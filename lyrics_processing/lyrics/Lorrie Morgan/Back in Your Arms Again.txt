I used to do you like this, do you like that
This way, that-a-way
Anyway but the right way
Was okay baby

Oh I guess you had to leave before I could see
That you're the only one with everything I need
But you won't even call me, you won't even talk to me
Come on and talk to me

Oh baby if I could be back in your arms again
Tell you all the things I should have said back then
I wanna let you know just how wrong I've been
Oh how wrong I've been
Oh honey you know if I could just hold you one more time
Tell you all the things that I got on my mind
How could this grown girl be so blind
How could I be so blind

You used to do me so good, do me so right
Every time I need you
In the middle of the night
You'd be right there baby
You might also like
Oh I never thought I'd wake up and you'd be gone
If you can find it in your heart to come back home
Honey if you'd let me I could make it up to you
I'll make it up to you

Oh baby if I could be back in your arms again
Tell you all the things I should have said back then
I wanna let you know just how wrong I've been
Oh how wrong I've been
Oh honey you know if I could just hold you one more time
Tell you all the things that I got on my mind
How could this grown girl be so blind
How could I be so blind

I was having me a good time, giving you a bad line
Every time I got home
But now I'm going insane, I thought I had a good thing
My good thing's good as gone

Oh baby if I could be back in your arms again
Tell you all the things I should have said back then
I wanna let you know just how wrong I've been
Oh how wrong I've been
Oh honey you know if I could just hold you one more time
Tell you all the things that I got on my mind
How could this grown girl be so blind
How could I be so blind
Oh baby if I could be back in your arms again
Tell you all the things I should have said back then
I wanna let you know just how wrong I've been
Oh how wrong I've been
Oh honey you know if I could just hold you one more time
