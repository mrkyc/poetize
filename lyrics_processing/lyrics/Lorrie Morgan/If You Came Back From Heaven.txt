I wouldn't know what you say
I wouldn't know what to do
If you came back from Heaven
And I could look at you

Would I fumble for the words
Would I be a little shy
Would I bust right out with laughter
Or break right down and cry

Oh if you came back from Heaven
Would it be like it was then
Could we just pick up where we left off
And try it all again
Oh if you came back from Heaven
It would freeze me in my tracks
And I hope God knows
If He let you go
I'd never send you back

Do your kisses feel the same
Do you still have the same touch
And will you whisper softly
That you've missed me so much
You might also like
Have you heard all my prayers
When I laid down at night
And did you feel my body
When I held your pillow tight

Oh if you came back from Heaven
Would it be like it was then
Could we just pick up where we left off
And try it all again
Oh if you came back from Heaven
It would freeze me in my tracks
And I hope God knows
If He let you go
I'd never send you back

And if, God forbid
You leave this earth
Again while I sleep
I hope He knows
If you go
You'll be bringing me

Oh if you came back from Heaven
Would it be like it was then
Could we just pick up where we left off
And try it all again
Oh if you came back from Heaven
It would freeze me in my tracks
And I hope God knows
If He let you go
I'd never send you back
I hope God knows
If He let you go
