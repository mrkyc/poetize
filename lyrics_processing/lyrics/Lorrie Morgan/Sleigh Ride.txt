Just hear those sleigh bells ring-a-ling
Ting, ting, ting-a-ling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
It's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fire place while we'll watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print of Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we'll remember
All through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells ring-a-ling
Ting, ting, ting-a-ling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up

Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Come on, it's lovely weather
