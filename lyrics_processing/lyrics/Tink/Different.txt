You wasn't there when I was alone (Alone)
Say that you care, when really you don't
It's all in your actions, none of my fault
'Cause I ain't the kind you put to the side whenever you want
There must be something to hide (To hide)
Feel like when you're on my line
There's someone around to stay in the cut, ooh-ah
So do me a favor, show me the paper
I'm not in the mood to cry anymore
That ain't the vibe that I'm going for
Thought you were cool, all of it's fake
Told you before that money and girls are never replaced
All that I gave you, all that I am
You're just a boy who can't be a man

You're spendin' time away all night
I need you here by my side
You said you'd be around for life
You don't even call my line

Yeah, yeah, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' a way
Yeah, yeah, why all a sudden you change?
Nothin' with you is the same
I don't know how to explain
All we ever do is fuss
Ain't no way to make this up
You're acting different (Mmm, hmm)
So different (Mmm, mmm)
Different (Mmm, mmm)
So different
You might also like
What did I say, or what did I do?
You can't even talk or look in my eyes when I'm in the room
So why would you act like this was a home?
Dealin' with girls who cannot compare to nothin' I'm on
I'm feelin' so disrespected
I cannot even accept it
You're so out of line for wastin' my time, and
Now you're neglectin'
Wildin' out in public
You just love to switch up the subject
I'm so tired of you flippin' and fumblin'
Say I'm trippin' on you over nothin', but
Look at yourself, you're doing me bad
It's all in your tone, you hang up the phone and never call back
What do I do? Start up a fight?
I hate to be wrong, I knew all along that this wasn't right

You're spendin' time away all night
I need you here on my side
You said you'd be around for life
You don't even call my line

Yeah, yeah, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' a way
Yeah, yeah, why all a sudden you change?
Nothin' with you is the same
I don't know how to explain
All we ever do is fuss
Ain't no way to make this up
You're acting different (Mmm, mmm)
So different (Mmm, mmm)
Different (Mmm, mmm)
