Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
I think of your love
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
I think of your love

Tryna please a nigga almost made me lose my mind
I don't know what's real no more, they in disguise (They in disguise)
Even though we done, I wouldn't put you through no pain
But it hurt my heart to know you don't feel the same (You don't feel the same)
I took them risks with you, hmm (I took them risks with you)
I was your bottom bitch, yeah (I was your bottom bitch)
You broke my heart, now the situation's messy (Situation's messy)
And I hate myself for the way I let you disrespect me

I've been in savage mode (In savage, savage mode)
Gotta let these feelings die (These feelings)
'Cause these niggas come and go (Go)
My heart is super cold (Cold)
And I'm not no camera man, but all these niggas playin' roles
I had you spoiled, I was loyal until you tried me
I took you with me, had you ballin' like you was Kyrie
You disrespected, fuck the presents and handbags
I can't be friendly, niggas takin' advantage
You might also like
You fucked my friend, that hurt me deep
Like an eviction, you for the streets
I held you down, yeah, thought I would marry you
Can't trust nobody, all these niggas be in character, yeah

Tryna please a nigga almost made me lose my mind
I don't know what's real no more, they in disguise (They in disguise)
Even though we done, I wouldn't put you through no pain
But it hurt my heart to know you don't feel the same (You don't feel the same)
I took them risks with you, hmm (I took them risks with you)
I was your bottom bitch, yeah (I was your bottom bitch)
You broke my heart, now the situation's messy (Situation's messy)
And I hate myself for the way I let you disrespect me

I had you covered from the moment we fell in love
So many problems come with fucking 'round with a thug
Can't stand your partners 'cause them niggas be in your ear
Soon as it get hectic, all them niggas gon' disappear
Any bitch can have him, then that nigga was never mine
Givin' out my bidness like a story on Channel 5
You fightin' demons, had me dreamin' you was an angel
I don't want no label 'cause you made it so hard to claim you
You fucked my friend, that hurt me deep
Like an eviction, you for the streets
We could've been perfect, I just needed you to fight more
How you let me go when you were someone I would die for?

Tryna please a nigga almost made me lose my mind
I don't know what's real no more, they in disguise (They in disguise)
Even though we done, I wouldn't put you through no pain
But it hurt my heart to know you don't feel the same (You don't feel the same)
I took them risks with you, hmm (I took them risks with you)
I was your bottom bitch, yeah (I was your bottom bitch)
You broke my heart, now the situation's messy (Situation's messy)
And I hate myself for the way I let you disrespect me

Ooh, yeah
