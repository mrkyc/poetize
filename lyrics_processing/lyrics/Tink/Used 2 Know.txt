Seems like everybody changed on me
People that I used to know
They don't come around no more
Ever since we made it
Friends that I once knew look at me different now
Since we made it
I'm getting random calls from family
That's from out of town
Ya day ones be the main ones
That will talk down when you're not around
If you let 'em in, and it's all bad 'cause we go back
And I doubt that we were too close, for the jealousy
And you hate that we don't talk much
Should've call more, should've made time, that's true
I should've did that, could've did that, would've did that
But you know the phone works two ways
So don't get offended when I can't really hang for the night
We'll be alright, just know that I'm chasing that dough
I got you as soon as I blow, blow
Careful who you call your homies
Seems like everybody changed on me
People that I used to know
They don't come around no more
Ever since we made it
Friends that I once knew look at me different now
Since we made it
I'm getting random calls from family
That's from out of town
You might also likeSo I lay low 'cause I don't know who to trust now
'Cause I'm on now and you ain't it
For me to fall off, pull it all off, it's a sad thing
Love strange when you make it
All you had to do was say something
I never forget where we came from
Even with the money, the fame and the fortune
The face I'm wearing is the same one (today)
So don't get offended when I can't really hang for the night
We'll be alright, just know that I'm chasing that dough
I got you as soon as I blow, blow
Careful who you call your homies
Seems like everybody changed on me
People that I used to know
They don't come around no more
Ever since we made it
Friends that I once knew look at me different now
