Reckless with love, she's reckless with love
Reckless with love, she's reckless with love

You don't even need to know her name
You've seen the type and you know the game
No matter how you start, it all ends the same
Reckless with love, she's reckless with love

The best you got doesn't work at all
She only gets fulfilled from sabotage
Flashes a smile just before you fall
Reckless with love, she's reckless with love

She'll lay you down when she's standing you up
And no matter what you do she always gets what she wants
So she gives you just a little and a little too much
And she's reckless with love, and she's reckless with love
She's taking all you've got but it's never enough
And you're holding on for something that you know never comes
And she gives you just a little and a little too much
And she's reckless with love, and she's reckless with love

Wish you away if you get too close
Still ???
