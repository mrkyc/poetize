Check I'm high, you hold down
Sooner or later he was bound to come out
'Cause I've been wild, I've had my time
An all of your patience had a place in my mind
Took for granted all that you know
Yeah, I got this feeling, I don't wanna let go
So come on, come on, come on now
Been down this road before, now
Wasting all this time
That we'll never get back
Now, what are you waiting for?
Now, I'm ready to take it all
Save me now
Or I'm never gonna get back
And I'm livin' without you now
And I'm just a beggar without you
So save me now
Or I'm never gonna get back
You gave me love, I gave you help
It has its uses but I never could tell
You dived in, I shared my skin
Yeah, I got this feeling, I don't wanna give in
