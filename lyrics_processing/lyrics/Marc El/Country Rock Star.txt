Sing my songs, and go real far
I wanna be a country rock star
I grew up with the radio on
It was AM/FM all day long
With hopes and dreams that I would be
Singing my songs on MTV
I liked Guns 'n Roses, Johnny Cash
John Cougar Mellencamp, the Knack
Singing oh My-Ma-Ma-Ma-My Sharona
I 'Hurt So Good' in a 'Ring of Fire.'
'American Pie,' 'I Will Survive,'
The Bee Gees sang, I was 'Stayin' Alive.'
I was singing that song on the radio
Rock on!
Had my blue suede shoes on
Developing a little lockjaw, yee-haw!
Doing the Michael J moonwalk just for fun
'Boot Scootin' Boogie' with Brooks and Dunn
I was singing in the shower
I was singing in the rain
I was singing on the way to work in my car
I wanna be a country rock star

I was up onstage at a karaoke bar
Coincidental I was feeling sentimental
Got a little goose-bumps
Springsteen sang the 'Glory Days,'
I was born in the USA
I was singing that song on the radio
Rock on!
Had my blue suede shoes on
Developing a little lockjaw, yee-haw!
Doing the Michael J moonwalk just for fun
'Boot Scootin' Boogie' with Brooks and Dunn
I was singing in the shower
I was singing in the rain
I was singing on the way to work in my car
I wanna be a country rock star
You got to put your mind to it
Got to be the best; don't settle for less
Don't sell yourself short; don't be afraid
You never know; it's a chance to take
I was singing that song on the radio
Rock on!
Had my blue suede shoes on
Developing a little lockjaw, yee-haw!
