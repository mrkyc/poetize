I wasn't raised on a silver spoon
I never ate from a silver platter
Didn't sleep a week in fancy rooms
But I shine like a diamond so it didn't matter
You got a dollar, stick it in my jar
Always told me "son, you would go far"
I dance for the money, but I sing for applause
Try to come and get me, I ain't breaking any laws
Try and keep up
Took a look at what you thought of me
Had a lot to do with who you grew to be
I never let your trash talk hold me back
'Cause I'm a funky cocky in a gunner sack
Head full of dreams and a pocket full of pennies
Didn't have a benefactor, never needed any
You're loved by some and you're hated by many
We gotta pop 'em and rock 'em
Sock 'em with the shimmy sayin'
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
Sock 'em with the shimmy sayin'
Hey hey hey, yeah
You might also likeChampagne taste on a silver bullet budget
You can't move the ball if you're afraid to nudge it
My dad always said "son it's like a told ya:
If you want to go and get it can't nobody get it for ya"
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
Can't nobody get it for ya
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey hey hey)

(Hey hey hey hey hey)
You got a dollar, stick it in my jar
Always told me "son, you would go far"
I dance for the money, but I sing for applause
Try to come and get me
Try to come and get me
You can try to come and get me, I ain't breaking any laws

Don't call a doctor 'til you're feeling ill
You never need a lawyer unless you're dealt a dirty deal
Don't reach into your pocket 'til you put your money down
And you're gonna need your dancin' shoes when Cody comes to town
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
When Cody comes to town, yeah
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey hey hey)
You're gonna need your dancin' shoes when Cody comes to town
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh (Hey hey hey hey hey)

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh (Hey hey hey hey hey)
Take it back now

Ooh ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (Hey hey hey hey hey)
