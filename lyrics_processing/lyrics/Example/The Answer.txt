It was like slow-motion
When you walked into the room
It's like they're frozen
Just sit back, enjoy the view
If this the ocean
You're some undiscovered species
You save me from myself that night, believe me

Had so many questions on my mind
Where the hell you been all of my life?
Straight out from the darkness to the light
You're the answer, you're the answer to the meaning of my life
You're the answer to the meaning of my life

I could paint a picture
Of every detail in your eyes
First time I lipsed ya
Whole world stopped going by
Rewrite the scripture
And call it my only weakness
I turned my shit around and now they're speechless

Where the hell you been all of my life?
Straight out from the darkness to the light
You're the answer, you're the answer to the meaning of my life

I know you'll miss me like cold crush
Don't we risk it like gold dust
Go the distance like Mo does
Do the opposite of what they told us
And I hope you notice I was hopeless
'Til I found you, readjust my focus
Hocus Pocus, you appeared like boom
Froze like a statue, whole room looking at you

Had so many questions on my mind
Where the hell you been all of my life?
Straight out from the darkness to the light
You're the answer, you're the answer to the meaning of my life
You're the answer to the meaning of my life

I know you'll miss me like cold crush
Don't we risk it like gold dust
Go the distance like Mo does
Do the opposite of what they told us
I know you'll miss me like cold crush
Don't we risk it like gold dust
Go the distance like Mo does
