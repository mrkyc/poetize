This could be the very last kiss from my little miss perfect
Certainly I'll savour that funny how the money pays for stuff
But doesn't pay for that special little moment
I know what I'm after dont know what I'm aiming at
Didn't mind the baby chat or giving you my name and that
The apple of my eye, you puzzle me sometimes
I need to find the apple guy and maybe he can make an app
Failing that, maybe we should take another roll of the dice

Can't believe we both let it fade away
I want to stay for another day
If you wanna save us give me a signal
Anything will do
Can't believe we both let it fade away
I want to stay for another day
If you wanna save us give me a signal
Anything will do

I used to sleep like a baby now I lay awake at night thinking about my lady
Maybe I should take her back maybe I should take a plunge
Maybe I should cancel all my flights take a right turn left is just a place to run from my demons
No-one understands me better than my girl except my family
And we hanging by a thread I go to turn my head, think twice, maybe take another roll of the dice
See Example LiveGet tickets as low as $126You might also like

I got two main worries in my mind
One, will I ever find another girl as beautiful and kind?
Two, and if I say goodbye will I mind if I saw you in the street with other guys?
I try I really do tell myself mate this is 50/50 this is give and take
But I just make mistakes this is 70/30
Christ, I think we could be running out of rolls of the dice


I never ever ever ever ever wanna forget
I never ever ever ever ever wanna forget
I never ever ever ever ever wanna forget
I'm gonna keep the ticket stuff from when we first met
