Light up a flame while I'm running the game
Blow up your speakers and take all the blame
Ain't on my level, what a big shame
Cutting up tracks like an execution
You ain't heard this, I'm an evolution
What's the solution? Off me it's a bonus
Other MCs were my blood donors
Who's this cat from Hammersmith
Spitting on tracks and chatting shit?
Who told him he had a gift?
Shut your mouth, guys, have a spliff
We don't wanna hear your minor story
It ain't never been like you, Mr. Boring
Chat nonsense, you depress the ravers
You wouldn't know flow if she was your next-door neighbour
So what do you bring to the table?
I brought five courses
You bought scraps, it's horse shit
My eyes see lies like Inspector Morse's
Earned what I got like fair divorces
Course it's better, keep the portion
Made to measure, drop the pressure
Come play the game, I'll test ya
See Example LiveGet tickets as low as $126You might also likeFirst I got clocked by The Streets
Then I got stopped in shops on the streets
So I got watched by lots of peeps
But then I got dropped by The Beats
But there ain't no beef
To a certain degree, it's working for me
There's a new version of me, personally
It's made me better as an artist and an MC
Give me any BPM, anything you send, I'll hurl
Watch me get friendly with a pen and a pad
Please don't try and put me in a box
Try and pigeonhole me, other pigeons better watch
I don't hip hop, I genre hop
Cause if I do urban, sure to flop
I'm on a next tip, spitting for the cheques tip
Spit for your boys and just use it next year
Hey diddle diddle, let me spit another riddim?
Like another, like I've seen you in the middle with her three little girlies
She winding purely, yeah, curly
Give a little twirly, hurly burly
See? I can chat all the bullshit
It don't make sense but the kids applaud it
I used to ride 138s and chat nonsense
Now I need a beat from Ronson
I never have been on the list of what's hot
But I still win like I beat the stopclock
See, I got the business brains you've not got
You know I sell more T-shirts than Topshop
Whether tryna write hooks for pop songs
Or chatting 16s over beats from Locked On
Crowds get hype, Glasgow to Hertford
Better fix up, put brand new socks on
This day, that day, every day a rat race
Been around since Fatlace, tell me how
That tastes, partner, no, I'm not a chancer
Looking for the right answer like catch phrase
Day, that day, every day a rat race
Been around since Fatlace, tell me how
That tastes, partner, no, I'm not a chancer
Looking for the right answer, yo
Rudeboy, don't watch me
Cause I'll smack you in the boat like Rocky
And no, I didn't grow up in Stepney
But I'll kick you in the head like Jet Li
Nobody ever said I was a grime MC
And it's fine by me, run a line by me
And I'll flip the script, times a rhyme by three
That's me, EG - rapper, poet, MC
You know I don't send any friendly fire
Better piss off, bredrin, check your tyres
The stock gets higher, even in a crisis
I stand tallest, alright, squire?
Mixed by Wire, Mr Example
One day, man'll be a king, there'll be a castle
Me? I'll outlast you, take your crown off
Pass the parcel, fuck you, arsehole
I've never been a hyped-up dude you read off
I'm more like the geezer the ravers feed off
More than one genre, more than one lyric
I do what I like, to me there's no limit
Put up your lighters, I clash the Titans
Fight the fighters, Mike fight the biters
Spit to my throat, got tonsillitis
That's on a Monday mornin', ha
I'm takin' over, run straight past ya
No warnin', a real disaster
Harder, faster, stronger, longer
This one here was top of the classroom
Stop the lecture, drop the pressure
Never say never, but nevertheless I
Never say no to experiments
Whether it's tenements, clubs, yards, spittin' with eloquence
Positive sentiments
Havin' a hell of a time and it's evident
Don't question my relevance
