Gotta draw a line can't sit on the fence all day
Despite what the kids may say
We'll fight if they don't press play, pretty sure
Gotta make a stand can't sit on the fence all day
Despite what the kids may say
We'll fight if they don't press play, this is war

Cause we're starving
We're hungry for more of the good stuff
Thirsty for more of the bad stuff
When you gonna show us the way
When you gonna show us the way?
When you gonna show us the way?
When you gonna show us the way?
When you gonna show us the way?
When you gonna show us the way?
When you gonna show us the way?
When you gonna show us the way?
Show me the way to go home
The way to home
The way to home

Praying for a silence
It won't arrive 'til our lungs don't want anymore
Praying for a silence
It won't arrive until your soul's lying down on the floor

Check your in-flight detail
And up your street fighting scale
We keep going if the lighting fails
Hold torch like Nightingale
Hard as nails when they sail
More exciting tails, holy grails, eyo
We break bread until the bread turns stale
Let me hear you say eyo
And eat it up throw it all on the table
Check the label read the dog tags
We stand tall but the floors unstable
I don't know what you been told
Outside, it's pretty damn cold
Rise up, we point to the sky
You know we're strong from the look in our eye
