Did you think that I'd forget?
I can still remember
What I was like before I was this guy
And yet
I just can't remember
What your sad face looks like
What's battling my conscience
Chatting so much nonsense
Asking me daily who's my friends
Forgot just what my name was
Devil had me brainwashed
Finally found my world again
I let it all bleed away
Cause freedom's overrated
Thinking it over
Now I'm gonna seize the day
Cause freedom's overrated
Been thinking it over

I was so lost, I lost the plot
Now I need to strike whilst the iron is hot
It don't matter now I got
Someone to die for again

Someone to die for
Someone to die for again

Someone to die for again

I was always tryna be facetious
Laughed in the face of teachers
Never tried to act like a heavenly creature
I was too aware of my facial features
Didn't really know how to chat to ladies
They used to look at me like I had the rabies
Even when they did wasn't that amazing
They only really asked bout my dad's Mercedes
Ten years later, step my game up
Top the charts, kickstart the party
The same pretty girls who would laugh and diss me
Now they wanna change the way they kiss me
Who we tackled today, getting carried away
You had a lovely woman, threw your marriage away
Test my stamina daily with extravagant ladies
Went fucking crazy in happiness' face
We made a few mistakes
But we never worked hard in the humour stakes
I think you just preferred me on autopilot
Not escaped from a mad asylum
We had some good times and you can't deny them
I did a few things that I can't decipher
But we all gotta change our life up
Wise up, now I got a girl to die for
