One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had our promise made
Four hands and then away
Both under influence
We had a divine sense
To know what to say
We were in love

We said our goodbyes
So I had to let you snooze
Cause if you woke then Id never leave
How could I semitize
Looking in your eyes it would agonize
Staring in them one more time, I just stand there paralysed
This was a strictly a one nighter
To delight us, we both knew this must stay quiet
It was vital we couldn't forget though
We never let go we just held on tighter
See I'm a lover not a fighter
So I didn't fight the fact that I more than liked you
Didn't matter, we were scatter brains, under influence
To us it made sense this was more than lust
How can I explain it, I'm scratching my brain
Cause it's insane how these 10 hours felt like 10 years
Now I'm crying 10 men's tears, as it disappears
Along with the passionate atmosphere
I took your glove as a souvenir
Left the other on the pillow as I stroked your ear
And took one last sniff of your hair
And then stared for a second and I turned as the doorway beckoned
I never even caught your name, but that's minor
Still trying to think why my heartbeat skips
See I was gripped trying to work out the colour of your iris
Guess I have to call you none descript eyes miss...
Miss, what ever your name was, still though that was one night to remember

You and that red dress you were wearing, what a pairing
Tried to concentrate but couldn't stop glaring
And you kept staring, happily, back at me
Gradually I locked into your catwoman eyes
If that woman tries, to leave, I said to myself
Then I'll stop her, but I won't use force of course
Can't let her go, cause she'll never ever know
She's the fittest thing I have ever seen watching her my show
I dropped the mic looked down from the stage and winked at you, you winked back
You can't beat that split second point of acknowledgement
Solid guarantee you and me will link
I'll be the embodiment of love at first sight
On the first night, first I had to make contact
And sure enough, when the crowd are cleared
You were waiting at the side of the stage
In my eyes you were tailor made
Said little cause you didn't speak English
So we spoke through kisses, cause I'm hardly linguist
Put on the gloves as we left the venue
I felt the cold outside, even more than you
We grabbed a hot chocolate, left the town centre
Cause it was chock-a-bloc, Not a lot to do except
Look into your eyes till the morning
Ignoring the fact that I had to catch a plane
What a bastard that was
You know it's my job right, I would have stayed otherwise, believe me

You knew the hand of the devil
And you kept us awake with wolves
Sharing different heartbeats
