There's light at the end of the tunnel
There's fight at the heart of a struggle
Your smile should've told me you're trouble
No more, no more, no more
You owned me when I told you I loved you
You buried all my worth with a shovel
Your smile should've told me you're trouble
No more, no more, no more

No more goodbyes (so so long, so so long, so so long now)
No more white lies

You used to be the one true thing in my world
You told me that you loved me, you're in love with yourself
Shoulda listened to my mother, you messed around the others
Now you're dead to me, I've been sleeping with the enemy
Should keep your best friends close by
Should keep your best friends close by
You should keep your best friends close by
But keep your enemies closer, but keep your enemies closer

So many evil talents you juggled
It's fair to say you didn't act subtle
Your smile should've told me you're trouble
No more, no more, no more
Came crashing down I'm staring at rubble
They need to send you into space in a shuttle
Your smile should've told me you're trouble
No more, no more, no more

Strange and deranged
Seek fame was the name of the game
Defeat rivals, Abel and Cain
Get trophies, they'll look great in a frame
What would you have done, take all the blame
With your hand held firm over naked flames?
Being grilled now you're shaking again
Faking the pain, dark visions of Satan
Contemplating, talking man to man
She was a girl on film, Duran Duran
She called me her ape man orang-utan
Me Tarzan, she Jane
Take all the blame, I'm the bloke in the chorus
We were sweet once everybody saw us
I ain't flawless, still unsure
I loved us but I loved me more
No more goodbyes (so so long, so so long, so so long now)
No more white lies

You used to be the one true thing in my world
You told me that you loved me, you're in love with yourself
Shoulda listened to my mother, you messed around the others
Now you're dead to me, I've been sleeping with the enemy
Should keep your best friends close by
Should keep your best friends close by
You should keep your best friends close by
