Things you wanna see I've just done
I may regret if you're the right one
But I can't avoid the midnight run
I'll keep on going
I'll keep on going till I find the right one
I'll keep on growing
I'll keep on growing till I find myself a new gun
If we're meant to be together, change the way you see the weather
Live for now forget forever, we could still be here December
If we're meant to be together, change the way you see the weather
Live for now forget forever
On another midnight run
Sniffing for trouble unlucky for some
On another midnight run
I'll still be breathing come the morning sun
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I know, there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know, there'll be tears
Life's never that clear, clear
Clear

Were helping me get high as a kite
Someone promised me they wouldn't bite
I guess I'm someone different at night
I'll keep on going
I'll keep on going till my heart says don't
I'll keep on growing
I'll keep on growing till I find myself a new show
If we're meant to be together, change the way you see the weather
Live for now forget forever, we could still be here December
If we're meant to be together, change the way you see the weather
Live for now forget forever
On another midnight run
Sniffing for trouble unlucky for some
On another midnight run
I'll still be breathing come the morning sun
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I know, there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know, there'll be tears
Life's never that clear, clear
Clear
Got a couple of skeletons in my closet, couple of skeletons in my bed
Couple of skeletons in my wallet, couple of skeletons in my head
I never should've listened to the serpent no one's perfect certainly it weren't for me
You've tasted sherbet so don't point your sticks at me
I've read the ten commandments at large no harm ignoring parts of it
Had it up to here with the jargon, pardon they're my rules I started
Not saying that I don't feel guilty, silky smooth it's never gonna be
But I'm looking at a man in the mirror right now, and I'm not quite sure it's me
On another midnight run
Sniffing for trouble unlucky for some
On another midnight run
I'll still be breathing come the morning sun
It's hurting my eyes, it's hurting my ears
I know, I know, I know, there'll be tears
You're hurting inside, been hurting for years
I know, I know, I know, there'll be tears
Life's never that clear, clear
