Thinking about what I wanna say
Thinking about how I wanna say it
Really should head out and play
Let go
Thinking about what I wanna say
Thinking about how I wanna say it
Act like a bird of prey
Let go

This day, that day, every day a rat race
Been around since Fatlace, tell me how that tastes, partner
No I'm not a chancer, looking for the right answers like catch phrase
Just sitting there chilling in the bat cave, whilst listening to Nick Cave
Last night was a sick rave, way, used to be Elliot, now it's just a nickname
I call my own shots, wash my own pots, clean my own socks, change my own locks
Spit fire from the belly, but still my tongue gets tied in knots
I'm unorthodox so go call the cops, I ate all your crops
I emptied your boxes, urban foxes, watch this space, win like Camelot
Living in a paradox, searching for paradise
Oh that's nice, have a nice day, thought I found it
Tried to stay grounded, now I'm surrounded, clowns and scoundrels
Short time like times like this, I thought I want limelight, that's my right
I want a place by the riverside please, thanks for that geeze, no more deliveries
This is an epiphany I can still get high no limits me
Should I just go swimming with the women or anything similar, dark activities
Sounds all too familiar and that's just not cricket like Jiminy
Don't discriminate Jekyll or Hyde, everybody's different at night

Time might fly
Girls may cry
Lights may die
But the skies don't lie

The skies don't lie
The skies don't lie
The skies don't, skies don't

Just take my hand, don't let go
I'll show you that the skies don't lie
Just take my hand, don't let go
And I'll take you where the sun don't shine

I'm far too aware of my breathing, far too scared of you leaving
The things that you doubt I believe in, feeling kinda funny this evening
It'll all make perfect sense if you follow me
If you follow me, if you follow me, come follow me now
