Looking at the scraps from the party, been three days since we started
Sunday morning, TV's boring, you're ignoring me
Weatherman said it'd be nice but it's pouring down (down)
And your friend's still lying on the floor -- half dead, half snoring
A cup of tea won't do, a kiss from me won't do
I gotta get out of this habit we're in, the weekend comes and we're at it again
Saying it won't but it's happened again, slacking
I worship the ground you walk on but you're dragging me down

We never had a day go by we were sober
Sittin' in a cold room wide awake
And now I gotta say goodbye to the sofa
See, I gotta go, can't hide away
We never had a day, I never had a say
I never had the heart to show you my hate
We never had a day go by we were sober
Sittin' in a cold room wide awake

Yeah, I said you'll always be my girl, be my world, peeps can tell
And I'll always keep repeating those three words like speak and spell
But you kept your secrets well, I tried to leave I'm weak as hell
I kept ignoring the habit you fed, I'm Mr. Potato, sore in the head
You, me, Zombie Fred, I feel like Shaun of the Dead
Not how I was born and bred, follow the yellow brick road
Stop being a bitch, goodbye to the witch of the east, uh
I worship the ground you walk on but you're draggin' me down

Feed the habit, she's the habit
He's about to, he's about to go
It's freezing in the cold
Feed the habit, she's the habit
He's about to, he's about to go
It's easy out the show
Feed the habit, she's the habit
He's about to, he's about to go
It's freezing in the cold
Feed the habit, she's the habit
He's about to, he's about to go (go, go, go)
