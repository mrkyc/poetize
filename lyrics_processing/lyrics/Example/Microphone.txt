Take everything I say with a pinch of salt
Coming out with rubbish at intervals
Don't take what I say as an insult
Exactly what I did to the kids at school
I guess this probably means I'm into you
So I've put it down in words just to speak the truth
And girl I hardly know this is original
Hoping this should make sense to you

These words
You know they give me guidance
And I just hear the silence
Nothing worse then silence
So let me bring the sirens
We can fight the giants
We can battle tyrants all day
We'll stay all night and pray

Throw your stones (whooh-oh)
We can hold our own (whooh-oh)
Throw your stones (whooh-oh)
We can hold our own
I don't need no microphone

Saying what I thought was a piece of cake
On the evidence of things that I've seen today
I keep on saying things I don't mean to say
On repeat, on repeat, on repeat today
And I don't really care what the people say
So you'll never see me looking for legal ways
Every now and then I just reach a stage
I just sing it out and then lead the way

These words
You know they give me guidance
And I just hear the silence
Nothing worse then silence
So let me bring the sirens
We can fight the giants
We can battle tyrants all day
We'll stay all night and pray

Throw your stones (whooh-oh)
We can hold our own (whooh-oh)
Throw your stones (whooh-oh)
We can hold our own (whooh-oh)
I can make the whole world hear me
I can make the whole world hear me sing
I can make the whole world hear me
I can make the whole world hear me sing

Throw your stones
We can hold our own
I don't need no microphone

Throw your stones (whooh-oh)
We can hold our own (whooh-oh)
Throw your stones (whooh-oh)
We can hold our own (whooh-oh)

I can make the whole world hear me
I can make the whole world hear me sing
I can make the whole world hear me
I can make the whole world hear me sing

Throw your stones
We can hold our own
