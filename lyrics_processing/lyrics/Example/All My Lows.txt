It's a long, long time to wait, it's a long, long time to wait
Everything I promised you was there but I was late

Broke in two, I used to blame the substance, so confused
But that carried no substance, lost in a cave like sons of Mumford
Kept moaning, zoning in the comfort, now I blame myself
Went downhill just to up my numbers: you only need one, what's the point of hundreds?
Uh, and I never did ask, you said the answer would be yes
I killed us, had tools to build us a castle but I never played chess
Bad guess, made the wrong move, queen takes king, now I've been removed
Out the back door like a famous actor, cut us in half like stupid tax laws
We could have had a daughter, or maybe a son
A baby born with my eyes, a perfect smile like its mum
And I hope you find happiness, I hope you find love
I'm so so sorry and I hope that's enough

Said you gotta take off, take off
Take off the sad face I gave ya
Cause you are my saviour
In all of my lows, in all of my woes
Said you gotta wake up, wake up
Wake up the sad face I gave ya
Cause you are the saviour
In all of my lows, in all of my woes
All my lows
All my lows
All my lows (you could've avoided me)
All my lows (but I thank you for joining me)
All my lows (those days were a joy to me)
All my lows (and I thank you for joining me)
