I used to look up, but now I look down
Bet you're too afraid to take a look at me now
I used to look up, but now I look down
Bet you're too afraid to take a look at me now
I used to look up, but now I look down
Bet you're too afraid to take a look at me now
I used to look up, but now I look down
Come take a look at me

Never put me on a pedestal
Terrible things I've done, just call me indelible
Can't clean up my conscience, cause they were all ultra
God damn I'm cultured
Eat chicks up just like a vulture
I was never like this, then I got older
Some say wiser, some say cold
Don't say I didn't warn you, I already told you
Flash bastard, so plastered
Been too loud ever since classroom
I'm just battling demons, seemingly it's what I'm always tasked with
On purpose, constant curses just getS worse and worse
Plus a bit of Aspergers
ADHD, OCD, I'm OTT,
Without the need of coke or ketamine
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Maybe one day I'll think about settling
Put on the kettle and maybe watch a little bit of television
Think I lost touch
Don't know shit cause I'm always fucked
High on life, Why do I get by on shit my wife don't like?
Lots of crying, lots of crimes
Lots of lying, not so wise
What's the time? Time applied
Something, something, what's the rhyme?
Never found love at the bottom of a bottle
No role model but I'm rolling with my models
Chosen wise, I've chosen poorly, same old story
