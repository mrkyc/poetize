I've told too many girls that I love them
I've told too many girls they're the one
So why am I sitting here all alone
How do you measure fun

I've called lost property too many times
And I can't live properly, a piece of me died
I wasn't aware the Mona Lisa cried
Maybe I remembered my decent side
Wash the kisses off my neck and lock my past in the basement
I need to find your perfect replacement

Lets start, you've torn him apart
He had a lotta heart for a heartless bastard
So sad, sad it ain't lasted
Scream like you mean if you wanna go faster
Cause he'll never slow down
Tears of a clown like bits of Motown
Found what he needs and his heart still bleeds
But he'll never take a ride on your merry-go-round

We'll never know what we may find
Find on the other side
We'll never know what we may find

Hope you remember my love, remember my name
Put a message in the post, I hope you get it by May
Lock my past in the basement
I've found your perfect replacement

I've found something, never need your nothing again
I've found something, never need your nothing again
I've found something, never need your nothing again
I've found something, never need your nothing
I've found something, never need your nothing again
I've found something, never need your nothing again
Who's laughing now?
I've found your perfect replacement

Lock my past in the basement
