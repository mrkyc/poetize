Let's get an intro that's good to go

Well, I'm Mike and I like pinstripes
And skinny tights, girls with tight white Nike shorts
And I know that you know that we know
Bell Biv DeVoe, flow


In the morning I wake up
Shake up, shake up
But after baking up breakfast, I get dressed
Yes, put on my necklace
Then after I leave my home
Call Mr. Cold Ron on the  car phone
But Mr. Ron is on the freeway
Then quickly I call Ricky on a threeway
Told him what I had to say, said
"Forget all the he-say, she-say"
No pain, no gain, no fame; ain't nothing changed

Not a damn thing. You know what I'm saying, Ron?
Ain't nothing changed!
Ain't nothing changed, ain't nothing changed
Ain't nothing changed, ain't nothing changed
Ain't nothing changed, ain't nothing changed

Next, it's time to practice at the studio
Rehearsing verses is my duty though
Let the system boom, vibrate the room
All before high noon
When the groove is groovy
It soothes me like an old-time movie
We work and work and work and work
To wreck the concerts
No pain, no gain, no fame; yeah, ain't nothing changed

Ain't nothing changed, ain't nothing changed
(Cause we don't play, that's how we get paid)
Ain't nothing changed, ain't changed
(Yeah, that's how we get paid)

Behind stages, I may just look
Through pages of books
We'll take a vote: which lyrics to quote?
Flip the light switch up, turn the pitch up
As we pose for the picture
(Everybody get down!)
Now that we worked with no days off
Hard work pays off
When the curtain is raised
Clap your hands in the audience, give yourselves a praise
After the show
We had to go
Collect the dough
And sip some Mo'
And sign a couple of autographs
Yeah, and have a couple of lit ass
No pain, no gain, no fame; ain't nothing changed
Sucka
Ain't nothing changed, ain't nothing changed
(That's how we get paid)
