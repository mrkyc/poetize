It doesn't exist it was so true
My actions don't reflect my intentions
My pride and my heart at attention, stand still
Now you should delight on the truth
Never will believe that I did what I do
Now you pack our love in a bag
Sayin' that you're leavin' and you're not coming back, babe
And before you say goodbye
Are you willing to give us, give us just one more try
To at least say that we tried
Then to let our love like this die (One more try)
One more try
Girl I know we both have cried
But I'm asking, are you willing to give us just one more try
To at least say that we tried
Than to let our love like this die (One more try)
Are you willing to give it, one more try
I can't leave well enough alone
I refuse to let you go
Girl, I want you to stay
And I don't care if it sounds like I'm begging, baby
To make you cry and in my heart
Just say yes and that's a start
'Cause if you leave
I'll probably fall apart, baby

Counting every corner of the couch
Press the suede down, pull the shades down
Boo, let's lounge
Talk about moving ahead, that this wan' us
Be billionaire status, we bosses
Live in your world for years besides living in bread
And taking trip to Milan and lands
Gucci you, Louis me
Keep you locked in jewelry
We built a new plan on new releases
Say high fashion flashin', lavender Aston
We're buckets on crooks and castles
Yeah that's the motto aficionado
One more, the last try don't go telling you, don't blow
Baby don't leave, won't you please
Listen, don't go away
Put down that bag, won't you stay
'Cause if I say you don't
Really wanna go, and I know I don't
If you walk out the door, I need you baby, yeah
Before you say goodbye
Are you willing to give us, give us just one more try
Don't give up on us baby
One more try
One more try

Oh, baby,oh no
