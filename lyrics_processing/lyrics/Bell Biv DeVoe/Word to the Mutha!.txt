People come
People go
In this business
You'll never, never know
Some are good
Some are bad
You know we got what no one's ever had, oh
See Bell Biv DeVoe LiveGet tickets as low as $78You might also like

How we really feel
They don't know the deal

We've got to put this back together
(Get right back)
And send our word to the mutha
(Get back)
Right back where we started from
(Get right back)
And send our word to the mutha

Times are getting kinda hard on the boulevard
Brothers and sisters being slayed and scarred
Girlies in the halls, bitin' the walnuts
Of the pusherman, for losing the loot
(Get to know the Johnson or he will shoot)
He pulled the trig' 'cause he figured he could be a bigger nig
In the projects, you see
So feel the bozack
Yo, Rick, come easy
We are one, breaking new
Oh, Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, Mike, Ralph, and Johnny, too
You see, it ain't nothing but a thing that we're gonna do
Everybody's always talking 'bout the NE crew
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

It's poison
Don't be cruel
It's my prerogative
To do what I gotta do
Have a little sensitivity
Do me, baby
I wanna get rubbed the right way
So what you gotta say
Oh, no, she's a candy girl
Living in a half-crazy world
That's the way I'm living, girl
Now every little step I take
Is another NE heartbreak
My, my, my
Word

(Get back)
We've got to put this thing together
(Get right back)
And send our words to the mutha
(Get back)
Bringing it right back where we started from
(Get right back)
And send our words to the mutha
(Get back)
We got to bring it back
We got to bring it back to the mutha
(Get right back)
Hey, hey, hey
Yo, Rizz...

It's bound to go down
Lost spirits never found
(Trips to the graveyard's a common thing in Beantown)
Smugglers, pimps, pocket-pickers, punks and troublemakers
(Pick eject in button pushers and dream shakers)
Crackhead's having babies, future's hazy
I don't know, shit's crazy
(All I could do is turn the heat up
Defeat all odds, get revenge and put the beat up, and eat up)
Suckers looking for the kill, first blood's gotta spill
Light 'em up with a Mac-10, and that's basin'
(Check the scene with the green pepper weapon
Keep stepping)
Like true brothers
Word to the mutha!

The time will come
And we will be as one
Wanna be legends, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows
How we really feel
They don't know the deal

Hey, y'all
Hey, y'all, hey
