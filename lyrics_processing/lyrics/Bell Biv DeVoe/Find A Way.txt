Girl I got a find a way (Find a way)
Despite all these people up in here I'm on it
If you wanna go home

You flirting with the boss, I demand respect
I get a check just to turn my neck
I learn to speak Italian from the clothes I wear
I was writing this verse walking off my jet (Okay)
So imagine what would happen if you leave with me
Ain't no telling what we gonna do next
So you can stay here with your chicks
Or take the risk
And be a lover in my biopic
Which one you pick, huh? (Let's go)

Girl, I gotta find a way
Despite all these people up in here
I'm on it
If you wanna go (Wanna go)
Don't walk away no (Away no)
I know that you be feeling me
Get on it
Come on, come on

Yo, look at here my little my cherie amour
Let's put our disagreements to the side
Get down and hit the floor
If I gotta swallow my pride then so be it
You're worth every drop and all I need is one shot
To get back into your good graces
The way you shake your frame
Make me allowed good gracious
Beauty brown skin, deep
Queen of my castle
No games, charades, let's make it official
Make your life more pleasant, less stressing
No lies, more truths, see we're destined
Far from a peasant, my confession
White sand beaches, see we're destined
Come on

Don't walk away, no (walk away)
I know that you be feeling me
