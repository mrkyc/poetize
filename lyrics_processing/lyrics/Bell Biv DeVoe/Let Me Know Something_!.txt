You walk around with your nose in the air
When men try to talk to you
You treat them like you just don't care
It's all a front to me, you see
Cause I know how you're livin' day to day
So let's sit and talk about it
You deserve a break today
Let me know somethin', let me know somethin' girl
Let me know somethin', What's on your mind
Let me know somethin', Just let me know somethin' girl
Let me know somethin', What's on your mind
Girl, you don't respond when I speak to you
I can never seem to get through to you
Girl, happiness costs very little
Girl, what's on your mind?
Let me know somethin', let me know somethin' girl
Let me know somethin', What's on your mind
Let me know somethin', Just let me know somethin' girl
Let me know somethin', What's on your mind
Oh baby, yeah
Let me know what's on your mind
