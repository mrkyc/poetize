Hold up

You want a solution
But tryna prove me wrong
Why the paranoia?
Like I don't give my all (Don't go, don't go)
To violate you, baby
I just can't do (Hold up)
I'm no better off
Then without you (Don't go, don't go)
Won't you tell me
What it is I can do? (Hold up)
Would you believe me?
If I said there ain't no changing
In the way I feel (Hold up)
Must be another way to get to you (Don't go, don't go)

We'd be foolish if we go astray (Hold up)
Would be a disrespect to all we've been through
And not everybody knows that (Hold up)
It takes two to make a thing not go wrong

You and me forever, girl, you know what this is
Do I gotta plead my case 'cause you my favorite (Don't go, don't go)
Thought you knew that my heart was never vacant (Hold up)
Why you question when your finger got the ring there (Don't go, don't go)
I know I be in the wrong and you be knowing (Hold up)
You're cute and all, but, girl, you're probably on that bullshit
We'd be foolish if we go astray (Hold up)
