Girl, you know you the one, hit delete tho
Shit be done, finito
Off with him, for real
He don't get it, never will, stick a fork in him
I can give you that work, over here baby, get that work
No need for the lies, I'll say a bunch of slick shit to get between your thighs

There ain't no way when he's not around
Are you okay with the things he do
Are you cool being number two?
'Cause in my eyes, baby, he don't qualify for your attention
Shouldn't even come close to you
Girl, he doing his most
Cause baby, you're perfection
And I'mma make you understand, he don't got a chance

With the right man with you, you gon' be
The better version of you, you'll see
You'll never gotta worry about the inconsistency to getting all the love you need
You gave him so many chances, you need to leave
Girl, you could do better
All this stress, deception, got you confused
What is it that he do? Stella losing your groove
He thinking he can play, baby, he ain't got the juice

You don't gots to hurt no more

I can do the things that he'll never
Just face it baby, I'm better
Just say it, baby, I'm better, better

A fool around isn't what you need
Go 'head, baby, put your trust on me
I'll be there when you call on me to come through and hold you down like you need
I'll be your warrior if don't nobody get it, I'm sure enough
'Cause you and I together, victorious
I ain't gotta lie, girl, you got my eyes on the prize

With the right man with you, you gon' be
The better version of you, you'll see
You'll never gotta worry about the inconsistency to getting all the love you need

I'm better than the man you got
Probably 'cause I'm everything your man is not
And if you try to compare, I'mma stop you there
It's like parking your sailboat beside a yacht
With me, you get to overseas
And yes, I stay in the gym, so no need to flex
The most pleasing sex, I bet you need the sex
Make him your ex and make me your next

You don't gots to cry no more, baby
You don't gots to hurt no more
 treat you, baby, way better
I can do the things that he'll never
Just face it, baby, I'm better
Just say it, baby, I'm better, better
You don't gots to cry no more, baby
You don't gots to hurt no more
 treat you, baby, way better
I can do the things that he'll never
Just face it, baby, I'm better
