You ask me why, I say why not?
Anything is possible
Anything can be
Therefore tonight I'll get you hot
You'll feel a passion you never dreamed
And I know you feel I'm overconfident
What kind of man could I be?
It's clear to see it's like animal attraction
When you add it up it's just a matter of factions, girl

Something in your eyes told me
That you were looking for a man you could adore
Something in your eyes had given me a sign
And I knew it was on
I knew it was on

You think you're dry, I say you're wet
I can make it possible
I can make it true
And all night long I'll make you sweat
Coming to a feeling that's long past overdue
And I know you think, "why so much confidence?"
What kind of man must I be?
It's clear to see it's like adding and subtracting
When you add it up it's just animal attraction

Something in your eyes told me
That you were looking for a man you could adore, baby
Something in your eyes had given me a sign
And I knew it was on
I knew it was on
Something in your eyes told me (told me)
That you were looking for a man you could adore, baby
Something in your eyes had given me a sign (Oh)
And I knew it was on
I knew it was on

So when I get inside and make you wet, I'll lick you dry
Gonna make your body weak from all the body heat
And like a lion, you'll hear me roar
And when I feed it to your body, make that body get weak some more
I'll take you to the peak
I'll make you wanna scream
And like a lion, you'll hear my body roar and roar and roar and roar and roar
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, something in your eyes told me (Oh, yes, you know)
That you were looking for a man you could adore
I said something in your eyes had given me a sign
And I knew it was on

See it in your eyes
You've given me a sign
And I knew it was on
I knew it was on
It was something in your eyes
That took me to feel it
Something in your eyes
And hey, I can see it
Something in your eyes had given me a sign
And I knew it was on
I knew it was on
