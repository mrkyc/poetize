For you, I lose control tonight
Against my will
But you know I tried
To fight my lust for my obsession
Guess I've never learned my lesson
For you, I sink through my own nights
And I cut my wrist just to make things right
And we can't turn back the hands of time
It's deeper and deeper 'til my vision died

This time
I really wanted it this time
I couldn't stop it
But just keep in mind, it was just this time
I tried to ignore it, but it ate me alive
This time
I really wanted it this time
I couldn't stop it
But just keep in mind, it was just this time
I tried to ignore it, but it ate me alive

For truth, I spill about my life
I never wanted to make her cry
I know I lied, but I tried to hide it
She never knew, but I can't deny it
So choose, who must to live or die
To kill my affection, or to lose the mind
Oh my god, I wish I could rewind
Because I'm weaker and weaker, I need her tonight

This time
I really wanted it this time
I couldn't stop it
But just keep in mind, it was just this time

I can't stop this
I can't stop
This time
I really wanted it this time
I couldn't stop it
But just keep in mind, it was just this time
I tried to ignore it, but it ate me alive

This time
I really wanted it this time
I couldn't stop it
But just keep in mind, it was just this time
I tried to ignore it, but it ate me alive

I really wanted it this time
I couldn't stop it
But just keep in mind, it was just this time
I tried to ignore it, but it ate me alive
Oh
