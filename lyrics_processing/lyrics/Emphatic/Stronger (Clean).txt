I breathe
I breathe to see the truth
And it's not you anymore
I don't need your complications
Greed is all you offer

Break that! I don't need that!
You will never define me!
Break that! I don't need that!
You will never complete me!
Break that! I don't need that!
You will never control me!
Break that! I don't need that!
You will never break me down!

I can't believe in you any longer (any longer)
I am stronger
I can't believe in you any longer (any longer)
I am stronger
Stronger than you

You are empty, you are guilty you are dead (you are dead)
Dead to me and I'm never looking back (back)
I will leave you behind rusted (rusted)
Lost in time

Hold me under, but now I'm well (Break me down)

And you ripped my heart out, but now I'm well (Break me down)
(Break me down)
And you stole my soul, but now I'm whole
Now I'm whole
Break that!
