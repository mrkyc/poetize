I've had enough, I'll make 'em see
They'll never take another drop of blood from me
And judge you all, one final bow
I'll be your end of days
Blood in the streets, the royals fall
I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me
Where they will see, I'll be your end of days
I'll be your end of days

(Hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Back row judges bring the gavel down, goodbye
Tell me all the ways that I went wrong
They'd lock us up forever, give 'em half a chance
Out of sight, out of mind, same old dance

Keep the rebels down (Keep the rebels down)
Kill their every sound (Kill their every sound)
The more you try and silence me
The more I'm gaining ground (Ground)
You might also like
I've had enough, I'll make 'em see
They'll never take another drop of blood from me
And judge you all, one final bow
I'll be your end of days
Blood in the streets, the royals fall
I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me
Where they will see, I'll be your end of days
I'll be your end of days

(Hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Painted smiles, glad hands pick your pocket, money gone
Laughing to themselves, and forget your name
They make up any promises to go and sell your future
We all had a vote, tell me who's to blame

Keep the rebels down (Keep the rebels down)
Kill their every sound (Kill their every sound)
The more you try and silence me
The more I'm gaining ground (Ground)
I've had enough, I'll make 'em see
They'll never take another drop of blood from me
And judge you all, one final bow
I'll be your end of days
Blood in the streets, the royals fall
I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me
Where they will see, I'll be your end of days
I'll be your end of days

(Hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey)

I've had enough, I'll make 'em see
They'll never take another drop of blood from me
And judge you all, one final bow
I'll be your end of days
Blood in the streets, the royals fall
I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me
Where they will see, I'll be your end of days
I'll be your end of days

(Hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
End of days (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
