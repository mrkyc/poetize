Sittin' here in a hotel room
With your picture by the bed
The one we took Sunday afternoon
The week before I left
Your smile gets me through the day when I'm feelin' all alone
Sometimes it's the only strength I find out here so far from home
I miss you
Oh God I miss you!

Oh, but even in the silence
I can hear it like it's every angel singin' above
What we've got is Louder Than Love!
Oh, yeah even when I'm gone, I can hear it like a song
Like a melody that makes us one
What we've got is Louder Than Lo-o-o-oo-ove
Louder Than Love

Oh you look just like your mom back when she was young
A pretty face, beautiful eyes
You are my heart 'til the end of time
Here's a kiss from a thousand miles
Turn out the lights and say goodnight
I miss you
Oh God I miss you!
You might also like

No matter where I am
No matter what I do
I will always be with you!


Oh, but even in the silence
I can hear it like it's every angel singin' above
What we've got is Louder Than Love!

Oh, but even in the silence
I can hear it like it's every angel singin' above
What we've got is Louder Than Love!
Oh, yeah even when I'm gone, I can hear it like a song
Like a melody that makes us one
What we've got is Louder Than Lo-o-o-oo-ove
Oh yeah
Even in the silence (Love)
I can hear it like it's every angel singin' above
What we've got is Louder Than Love! (Love)
Oh, yeah even when I'm gone, I can hear it like a song (Louder Than Love!)
Like a melody that makes us one
What we've got is Louder Than Lo-o-o-oo-ove
