Get out

(You'll take it away, so I am through with this
Taking my life, it's time to re-exist)
Now it's over, you are sour
(Choke on the vine, because it reeks of sin
My vote is off because you won't give in)
Now it's over, you are sour

Get out, get out
Get out without a doubt
Get out of my life now

I got you in my head, locked inside my soul
Got to end my life with you now
I got you in my head, locked inside my soul
Got to end my life with you
I am through with you now

(Takin' my life, because I'm through with this
Now I'm all fine because you don't exist)
Now it's over, you are sour
(Now is the time where I can hear you scream
Why don't you lie so you  a dream?)
Now it's over, you are sour
You might also like
Get out, get out
Get out without a doubt
Get out of my life now

I got you in my head, locked inside my soul
Got to end my life with you now
I got you in my head, locked inside my soul
Got to end my life with you
I am through with you now

This holding tight drains all my life from my soul
Deciding your style. Is that a life?
So get out of me
Demons, let me be now, go now
Destroy, destroy your life

I got you in my head, locked inside my soul
Got to end my life with you now
I got you in my head, locked inside my soul
Got to end my life with you
I am through with you (Now)
Got to end my life with you
I am through with you (Now)
Got to end my life with you
I am through with you (Now)
Got to end my life with you
I am through with you (Now)
Got to end my life with you
