I call your phone just to hear your voice
To say, "Hello I Miss You Baby"
And It's driving me crazy
How are you?
It's been so long
I can't believe that you are gone
Have you found somebody new?

Well, no one said that It was easy
Two hearts beating
And no one said that it was perfect
But they don't know you

Where do we go from here?
I can't say goodbye
How can I make this right?
Where do we go from here
When I turn out the light?
I need you, baby
By My Side

By My Side

I made a mistake, and I'm sorry
I would take it back if I could
Please forgive me
I wanna be the one that makes you happy
I built the walls that held us back
I drove the car that made us crash
It was me
It was never you

Well, no one said that It was easy
Two hearts beating
And no one said that it was perfect
But they don't know you

Where do we go from here?
I can't say goodbye
How can I make this right?
Where do we go from here
When I turn out the light?
I need you, baby
By My Side

Can we give it one more try?
Just help me, baby
What can I do?
I wanna make it up to you!

Well, no one said that It was easy
Two hearts beating
And no one said that it was perfect
But they don't know you

Where do we go from here?
I can't say goodbye
How can I make this right?
Where do we go from here
When I turn out the light?
I need you, baby
By My Side

Can we give it one more try?
By My Side
Just help me, baby
By My Side
I made a mistake, and I'm sorry
