Hey
That's another mistake you made
Blame, blame, blame
Don't throw your hate on me
Blind, his eyes are gray
I'm still searching for what you ripped away, uh
Fade away
And never give a fuck what they say

Through all the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise
The noise, the noise, the noise

Stitch by stitch, you're goin' blind
Gonna cross you out one stitch at a time
Inside out, my day is night
Gonna stitch you up one stitch at a time

"Such a waste."
Well, that's just what they'll say
Shame, shame, shame
You had to throw it all away
It's just another day
I'm still searchin' for some hell to kill the pain
Fade away
Gonna make you fade the fuck away

Through all the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise
The noise, the noise, the noise

Stitch by stitch, you're goin' blind
Gonna cross you out one stitch at a time
Inside out, my day is night
Gonna cross you out to save my life
The feel, the touch, it hurts too much
Gonna black it out, I've seen enough
Dream, your eyes are open wide
Gonna stitch you up one stitch at a time

Stitch you up to black you out
I stitch you up, I stitch you up to black you out
I stitch you up, I stitch you up to black you out
I stitch you up, I stitch you up to black you out


Stitch by stitch, you're goin' blind
Gonna cross you out one stitch at a time
Inside out, my day is night
Gonna cross you out to save my life
The feel, the touch, it hurts too much
Gonna black it out, I've seen enough
Dream, your eyes are open wide
Gonna stitch you up one stitch at a time
Stitch by stitch, you're goin' blind (Through all the noise, the noise, the noise)
Gonna cross you out one stitch at a time (Through all the noise, the noise, the noise)
Inside out, my day is night (Through all the noise, the noise, the noise)
Gonna cross you out to save my life (Through all the noise, the noise, the noise)
The feel, the touch, it hurts too much
Gonna black it out, I've seen enough
Dream, your eyes are open wide
