Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

Open doors with a loaded gun
Break 'em down, man it's just begun
Feel the fire as I come undone
Yeah!
I breathe in, and it fills my lungs
Let it burn in a vacant sun
Cold blood just let it run, let it run

Miles between us, but now I'm here!

Do I walk the valley?
Do I die alone?
Am I first to sin as I cast this stone?
Do I? Oh, do I?
Yeah. Do I pull the trigger?
Do I snap a bone?
Do I suffocate?
Do I send them home?
Do I? Oh, do I?

Hey yeah!

Goin' blind from a fallen friend
Lay him down from Heaven's end
Do I keep on pushin', or do I just pretend?
Yeah!
Dust storms from a broken sky
Steam cracks and the well is dry
Break these chains, then I walk on by

You can't start over, now I'm here!

Do I walk the valley?
Do I die alone?

Do I? Oh, do I?
Yeah. Do I pull the trigger?
Do I snap a bone?
Do I suffocate?
Do I send them home?
Do I? Oh, do I?
Chase it down
Break it down
Chase it down
Break it down
Do I walk the valley?
Do I die alone?
Am I first to sin as I cast this stone?
Do I? Oh, do I?
