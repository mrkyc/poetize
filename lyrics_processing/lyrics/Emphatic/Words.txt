Taking your pills too swole on my dreams
Blacken the thoughts thats deep in my mind
Words that you say, you're like a disease
Luck in my life to see you just cry
Next to him, dim
But with you I'm weak
Fall to my knees, and scream at the sky
You turn me down whenever I speak
Just love so much, I wish I would die!

You're so low
United light
I can't forget the words that you said to me
Nothing you do will ever make sense to me

I've been living in a nightmare
I'm trying, then you don't care
You're chilling with my fake friends
And you're driving me to madness
Now I can see you're nothing to me
The owl's my game
Now asked you to lie
Sight of a girl, no heart of a beat
Love is a trust, so help I just lie
You might also like
You're so low
United light
I can't forget the words that you said to me
Nothing you do will ever make sense to me
You're so low
United light
I can't forget the words that you said to me
Nothing you do will ever make sense to me

I can't take this shit!
How could you make me believe
You love me and you always care
You were the light of my dreams
You know I'd die for
How could you make me believe
You need me and you always care
You were the light of my dreams
You know I'd die for


You're so low
United light
I can't forget the words that you said to me
Nothing you do will ever make sense to me
You're so low
United light
I can't forget the words that you said to me
Nothing you do will ever make sense to me
I can't take this!
I can't take this!
I can't take this!
