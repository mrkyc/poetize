Don't feel right
Don't feel same
Diss my mind
Is too plain
Please take out
This hate that burns inside me
These dark scars
Remind me
Of just what
You left me
Beginning
And in the hurt inside me

And I will wait for you
The world is broken down back behind me
So don't be a jewel this time
'Cause I am going to find
My way back home!
Back home!

Don't feel like
I'm in pain
These memories
All seem gray
So clouded
The hate that burns inside me
Just realized I'm this way
My actions
They will say
To give you
My hate that burns inside me
You might also like
And I will wait for you
The world is broken down back behind me
So don't be a fool this time
Decide you find the world way too frightening
And I will wait for you (Yeah, yeah)
The world is broken down back behind me (Yeah, yeah)
So don't be a jewel this time (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I am going to find (Yeah, yeah)
My way back home!
Back home!

Wish, wish, bright, and burn in my light (I!)
The pressure's end, there's no one who wouldn't cry (I!)
Wish, wish, bright, and burn in my mind (I!)
I'll burn up
Back behind me
In the before you
So back behind me
I'm never gonna be like you
Go back behind me
Pit the before you
So back behind me
I'll never...
And I will wait for you
The world is broken down back behind me
So don't be a fool this time
Decide you find the world way too frightening
And I will wait for you (Yeah, yeah)
The world is broken down back behind me (Yeah, yeah)
So don't be a jewel this time (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I am going to find (Yeah, yeah)
My way back home!
Back home!

I'm blind!
I'm blind!
New gut!
