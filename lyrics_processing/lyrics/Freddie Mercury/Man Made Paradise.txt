I want to gaze into your eyes and see the fire in their glow
But it's the same old story
Want you to melt inside my arms like falling rain upon the snow
But you say no, you say no

Want you to help me through deep waters when my ship is in a storm
Want you to give me all the power like a king on his throne
But you don't care, you don't care
History repeats itself, I seem to be all by myself again

Come into my life, it's a man made paradise
Come into my life, it's a man made paradise
Come into my life, it's a man made paradise
Come into my life, it's a man made paradise, paradise

One day I'll look into your mind and understand which way to go
But it's the same old story
When you refuse me all the time, I'm suicidal on my own
But you don't know, you don't know

I want to be beside you now, lie in the sand and kiss your brow
I want to fly beyond the moon and do the things we do for love
But you don't care, you don't care
History repeats itself, I seem to be all by myself again
You might also like
Come into my life, it's a man made paradise
Come into my life, it's a man made paradise
Come into my life, it's a man made paradise
Come into my life, it's a man made paradise, paradise


I want to be beside you now, lie in the sand and kiss your brow
I want to fly beyond the moon and do the things we do for love
But you say no, you say no
History repeats itself, I seem to be all by myself again

Uuh-oh
Uuh uuh oh
Uuh uuh oh
Oh
