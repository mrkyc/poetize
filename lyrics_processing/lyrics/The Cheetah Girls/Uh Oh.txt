Friday night, we feel alright, 'cause this is what we do
We're in the crowd, we're dancin' now, but all I see is you
I tell myself, "We've broken up," but it's still hard to say (It)
I try to turn my head around and look the other way (The other way)

What, you really care about me?
Do you care about me?
Are you ever comin' back to me, back to me?

(Here we go)
I should know better, but I just can't pretend
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm fallin' again
(Here we go)
Just when we promised that we'd only be friends
Uh oh, uh oh
We've fallin' again

It's Monday night, we're back to work, we're at the studio (Oh)
I'm tryna cut this song, but I keep starin' at the phone
(Starin' at the phone)
I wish that you would call and say, "We made a big mistake
And keepin' it together is a chance we wanna take."

What, you really care about me?
Do you care about me?
Are you ever comin' back to me, back to me?
Yeah, yeah

Here we go
I should know better, but I just can't pretend
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm fallin' again (Fallin' again)
(Here we go)
Just when we promised that we'd only be friends, (Yes)
Uh oh, uh oh
We've fallin' again

Make my heart super ecstatic
Spin my world into a habit
You had me from the very first day, hey
Me and you, it's automatic
Here's my heart, boy
You can have it
Tell me that you're feelin' this way
(Oo-oh-uh-oooh...)
(Mm-oo-oh-uh-oooh)
Uh oh, uh oh, I'm fallin' again
Oo-oh-ooh, yeah
(Uh oh, uh oh)
Whoa!

I should know better, but I just can't pretend
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm fallin' again
(Here we go)
Just when we promised that we'd only be friends
Uh oh, uh oh
We've fallin' again (Fallin' again)
(Here we go)
I should know better, but I just can't pretend
Uh oh, uh oh
I'm fallin' again
(Here we go) (Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh)
Just when we promised that we'd only be friends
Uh oh, uh oh
We've fallin' again
Fallin' again, oh-ooh

Fallin' again
(Uh oh, uh oh, I'm fallin' again)
I'm fallin' again
