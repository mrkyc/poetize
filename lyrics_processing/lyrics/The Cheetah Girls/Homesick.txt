Six hours behind, three changes of time
Ten thousands miles from home
I'm so far away, so long it seems like...
This road is all I know
When I was young, I dreamed of adventure and places I've never seen before
But when I close my eyes, I sleep at night
All I dream of, now, is home

So long...
That I've been gone
If there's one thing I know, is that there's no place like home
(Yeah)
Far away, it changes every day
If there's one thing I know, is that there's no place like home
(Yeah)

Six months since the day I went away
It didn't seem like that long
It hit me when I was changin' planes
From Paris to New York
I'm dreading the days that are ahead
I haven't slept in my own bed
Oo-oooh, I dreamin' of home...
You might also like
What I've seen and what I've done
Don't mean a thing, without, where I came from
To I am, and all I've ever did
Home is where the heart is
Where the heart is!

So long...
That I've been gone
If there's one thing (Oooooo-ooooh!) I know, is that there's no place like home
There's no place like home!
(Yeah)
Far away (Far away!), it changes every day (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
If there's one thing I know (If there's one thing I know,), is that there's no place like home (Is that there's no place like... home)
(Yeah)

Call me, tell me that you miss me
Give me something I can hold on to and get me through the days when I had
(Yeah)
I  can to take another moment
I need some clarity
Remind me what it's like to be
(Yeah)
(No place like, no place like home!)
Be back home
Far a-way
Like there's no place like home
I wanna go home, home, home
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Bring me back home, home, home

Ye-eah, ye-eah, yeah, yeah, yea-eah
Way, yeah
Oh uuuh, oh uuuh!

So long... that I've been gone Yeah
If there's one thing I know, is that there's no place like home
