All right
Hey
Hoo, ah-oh, whoa, ah-oh
Uhh
Hoo, ah-oh, whoa, ah-oh
Uh, ho, yeah

We're standing on the edge of something
Do we stay, or do we run?
It's obvious that everything's changed
My head can't seem to figure out
Why my heart is full of doubt
Maybe we're just tired of the game

Guess you never know what's gonna happen
So you do the best you can
Following your soul might bring you back
Or it may have another plan (Another plan)

Please, don't let it fly away, high away
Gotta keep it together, feel for the flow
Don't fly away, high away
Please, don't (Please, don't)
Don't let it fly away
You might also like
We've never felt this place before
Wonderin' if anymore
We can find in us what it takes
It's not about who's to blame
I pray that they're just growin' pains
Laughin' while they're testin' our faith

'Cause you neva' know what's gonna happen (You neva' know)
So you do the best you can
Following our souls might bring us back
Unless it has another plan (Another plan)

Please, don't let it fly away, high away
Gotta keep it together, feel for the flow
Don't fly away, high away
Please, don't (Please, don't)
Don't let it fly away (Fly away)

(It's yes, it's no)
(We stay, we go) We go
(Feels like we're questioning everything, yeah)
(We run, we fall, but through it all) Through it all
(We never thought we would break)
We never thought we would break, yeah
Please, don't let it fly away, high away
Gotta keep it together, feel for the flow
Fly away, high away
Please, don't (Please, don't)
Don't let it fly away

Fly away, high away (High)
Gotta keep it together (Keep it together), feel for the flow
Don't fly away, high away
Please, don't (Please, don't)
(Please, don't)
Don't let it fly away
Please, don't let it fly away, high away (High away)
Gotta keep it together, feel for the flow (Keep it together)
Don't fly (Hi-hi) away (Hi-hi), high (Hi-hi) away
Please (High away), don't (Please, don't)
