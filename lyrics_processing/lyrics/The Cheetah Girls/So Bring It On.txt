You do your best to write off my name
Try to control me, but that's gonna change
If you look closer, you'll know what I mean
You'll see the girl become a machine

I'll squeeze you, unease you, I'll freeze you
Alarm you, disarm you, I'll charm you
I'll block you, unlock you, I'll shock you
You wanna fight, then we'll do it my way

(So bring it on)
I'll have you wrapped up around my finger, yeah
(So bring it on)
When I start wearing you thin, you'll know for sure
(So bring it on)
I don't wanna get dangerous, put down your fist, it's over with
So listen up, 'cause you ain't messin' with me anymore

My invitation is not just a game
I've gotta show you that I can't be claimed
I've got the power to turn this around
'Cause it's my life and I wear the crown
