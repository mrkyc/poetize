Oh, pardon me
Now, tell me, would it offend
If I go talkin', tellin' all of my friends
How you belong to me?
Just like a piece of jewelry
I see I've got you wrapped up
Around my little finger, boy, just like a toy
I'll never let you linger, 'cause you can't annoy me

Would you feel insecure?
I think, I think you would see-

Now, you feel what a girl feels
Seein' how a girl feels
Tryna keep you, God, real
Don't you know that I just want you to feel
Tonight, don't ever forget what you give is what you get
Now, you feelin' how a girl feels

I'll pick you up and say, "I like how you're dressed."
What's on your mind? You know I couldn't care less
Or how your day has been
You see, it's not about your skill
It's all about your looks, babe
People starin' when we walk into a room
But how this guy is with me, nothin' left to prove
You might also like
You see, that's what you're here for
And nothing else, babe

Now, you feel what a girl feels
Seein' how a girl feels
Tryna keep you, God, real
Don't you know that I just want you to feel
Tonight, don't ever forget what you give is what you get
Now, you feelin' how a girl feels

Know that I'll be pretty, and I'll stay so quiet
Knowin' no one saw that my I.Q.'s higher than yours
And I could knock you to the ground
With my little finger
We ladies, havin' quite conscience to play it cool
Respectfully try not to make a fool of you
And we don't feel insecure, but we think you would, hun!

Now, you feel what a girl feels
Seein' how a girl feels
Tryna keep you, God, real
Don't you know that I just want you to feel
(I... want you to feel... what I'm feelin' right now!)
Now, you feel what a girl feels (Yeah)
Seein' how a girl feels
Tryna keep you, God, real (Nuu-eeah, yeah)
Don't you know that I just want you to feel
(I just want you to feel)
Tonight, don't ever forget what you give is what you get (Uh, huh)
Now, you feelin' how a girl feels
