Some day, some day, some day my prince will come
Some day, some day, some day my prince will come
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day, some day, some day my prince will come
Some day, some day, some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I know at the moment we meat
Or my heart will start skipping the beats
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day When my dreams come true
