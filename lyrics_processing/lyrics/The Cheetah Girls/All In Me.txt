Hey, hey...
Cheetah Girls... u-huh, u-huh

There ain't no gettin' me down today
The sun is shining, nothing's in my way (In my way)
I grab my purse, call my girls
Right now, it's for fellin' good (Yeah, I'm feelin' good)
(Ooh, ooh)

I'm doin' fine independently (Independently)
I might be busy, but I'm still free (But I'm still free)
Now is the time to unwind
Tonight, I'm on a mission
(That's right!)

So if you feelin' it too, well, come on
(Do what you've got to do)
Can't you hear that they're playin' our song?
(All you need is you)
Don't be shy, get on the floor

And the night is young, it's time to play (It's time to play)
We're steppin' out tonight (Tonight)
Can't tell me what to do no way (No way)
'Cause all I need is all in me

My eyes can only see the stars tonight (Stars tonight)
Ladies only, no boys allowed (No boys allowed)
Just havin' some fun, don't want nothin' from no one
That's right (That's right)

So if you feelin' it too, well, come on

The time is now!
(Time is now!)
To let it out!

To scream and shout!
