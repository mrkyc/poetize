I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You might also like
Ohh, Baby ...My Baby...
You know I love you
So baby, baby...My Baby
You know I love you
So baby, baby...My Baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click

I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do, baby
All I want for Christmas is you
Ohh, Baby ...My Baby...
You know I love you
So baby, baby...My Baby
You know I love you
So baby, baby...My Baby
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
The one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Ohh, Baby ...My Baby...
You know I love you
So baby, baby...My Baby
You know I love you
