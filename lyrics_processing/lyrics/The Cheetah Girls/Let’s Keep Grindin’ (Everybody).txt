Everybody
Everybody's lookin' for something

I'm ferocious when I see you instantly
So precocious, assumin' that you're into me
So feel some way you move me with your energy (yeah)
My hearts on fire (yeah), boy, come on and rescue me

When I see you, I lead you right this way (baby)
Can't control the way that I am behavin'
It's got a hold on me, movin' me rapidly
Romantic dancin', dreams are made of these gifts

Everybody

Everybody

Everybody
Feel the temperature risin'
Everybody
Come on, let's keep vibin'

So intense when you're sensing my vicinity
Hypnotizin', I just can't take my eyes off you
Let's hit the dance floor
Boy, and show 'em how we do
