I could be recognized from a distance
Yeah, I could be the biggest name on the screen
Singin' and dancin' forever, signin' my name for whoever
Yeah, it's all in my reach, yeah

If I give it all that I got
I get there to the top
But I don't even wanna go
If I have to go there alone, so

Set me on top of that mountain and let me
Fly to the end of the world
Yeah, I can go anywhere
But if you're not with me there
It'll never be enough
There's no place like us
There's no place like us

If I find the other side of the rainbow
Will I find that the gold ain't worth any price?
'Cause if we ain't there-
-For each other
Then all I got-
-Doesn't matta'
No, it won't be right to
You might also like
Give it all that I got
And get there to the top
If you're not up there with me
There's nothing I wanna see, so

Set me on top of that mountain and let me
Fly to the end of the world
Yeah, I can go anywhere
But if you're not with me there
It'll never be enough
There's no place like us
There's no place like us

It doesn't matter where we are or matter how far
'Cause even when we our separate ways, we'll be the place
I believe that I can do it, but alone I won't get through it
We know we gotta stick together, 'cause no matter what
There's no place like us

No, no, no
No place like us
No place like us

Set me on top of that mountain and let me
Fly to the end of the world (End of the world)
Yeah, I can go anywhere
But if you're not with me there
It'll never be enough
There's no place like us
There's no place like us

No where, no way, no price I'd pay
There's no place like us
No where, no way
