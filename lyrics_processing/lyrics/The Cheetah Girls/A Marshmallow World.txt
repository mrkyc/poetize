My favorite part of Christmas is watching my family open the gifts I gave 'em
I like cookies!
Do you know what my favorite part is?
My favorite part is the snow outside. At Christmas, it looks like a Marshmallow World!

It's a Marshmallow World in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's a time for play, it's a whip cream day
I wait for it all year 'round!

Those marshmallow clouds bein' frien'ly in the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin's head
It's shinning so your nose won't freeze

The world is your snowball
See how it grows
That's who it goes wherever you go

The world is your snowball just for a song
So go out and roll it along
You might also like
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date
What if spring is late?
In winter, it's a Marshmallow World!


The world is your snowball
See how it grows

The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along
