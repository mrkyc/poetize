One, two, three... crash

Thought I knew what I want
Busy chasing love down a one-way street
(Ooh, ooh, hey)
I pushed it to the limit, even through all the traffic
Thought your love was what I needed for me
That's when I blew my horn
Hoping he might hear the beep
But I wasn't sure, ooh

Oh, without a single warnin'
Suddenly, he was turning
Now, he noticed me
(Ooh, ooh, hey)
I guess the thrill was gone
I had a change of heart
Too late to change my speed

Baby, we crash
And I can't hit the breaks
I wanna slow down
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You seemed like a mistake
I wanna pass, but I'm going too fast
Baby, we crash
You might also like
Baby, we crashed
Love happened fast
But, boy, we crash
(Hey)

Wish that I saw a sign, but I was drivin' blind
Thought I had control
(Ooh, ooh, hey)
I wanted love so bad, I didn't think to ask
Before I drove a hundred miles on this road
That's when I blew my horn
Hoping he might hear the beep
But I wasn't sure, ooh

Oh, we got so out of hand
Love didn't go as planned
Didn't like his style
(Ooh, ooh, hey)
But, now, the wheels were turnin'
Cupid was busy workin'
I couldn't slow things down
Baby, we crash (Ooh)
And I can't hit the (Uh) breaks
I wanna slow down (Yeah)
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You seemed like a mistake
I wanna pass, but I'm going too fast
Baby, we crash

Baby, we crashed
Love happened fast
But, boy, we crash
(Hey)
Baby, we crashed
Love happened fast
But, boy, we crash
(Hey)

What was I thinking?
What did I do?
All that I knew was you seemed like you were cool
Where do we go now?
Was this all fake?
Wish I could turn back, but Cupid stole the brakes
I found out too late
Baby, we crash (Ooh)
And I can't hit the breaks
I wanna slow down
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You seemed like a mistake
I wanna pass, but I'm going too fast
Baby, we crash
(Baby, we crash)
And I can't hit the breaks
(Oh, we crash)
I wanna slow down
(Yeah, we crash)
But I think it's too late
(Oh, we crash)
Love happened so fast
(So fast)
You seemed like a mistake
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I wanna pass, but I'm going too fast
Baby, we crash
('Cause we crash)
And I can't hit the breaks
I want to slow down (Yeah)
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You (He) seemed like a mistake
I wanna pass, but I'm going too fast
Baby, we crash

Baby, we crashed
Love happened fast
