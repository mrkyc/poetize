Whoa!
(Cheetah, we like to set this off! Yeah, Off the Wall! Yeah, Cheetah Girls! C'mon!)

Looked so sad when ya sat near the corner (Sat near the corner)
She couldn't dance, called her a wallflower
She didn't know 'bout how the beat grabs a hold of your soul
Your soul

So, she nods her head
(She nods her head)
And she snaps her fingers
(And she snaps her fingers)
She has it in her
Taps her feet to the speaker box
(Ahh... to the speaker box)
She doesn't dance, but tonight, she might take the chance
(Come on)
(She could take the chance)

Look up in the sky
Reach for it, it's your guitar (It's your guitar)
Get it girl, you know, fly like a shooting star (Shooting star)
Let the music take you (Take you)
Off the wall (Off the wall)

The lights shines bright, they light up the dance floor
And now she's jumpin', DJ's playin' her favorite song
She's thinking, "Ooh...," the beat got's a hold of her soul (Her soul, soul)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

So, she nods her head
(She nods her head)
And she snaps her fingers
(And she snaps her fingers) (she snaps her fingers)
She's got it now
Her feet are poppin' like pop rocks (Pop rocks)
The way she's rockin', now (Woo), she's a dancin' queen
(Woo)
She is causin' a scene

Look up in the sky
Reach for it, it's your guitar
Get it girl, you know, fly like a shooting star (Like a shooting star)
Let the music take you (Let it take you)
Off the wall (Come on, come on, off the wall)
Look up in the sky
Reach for it, it's your guitar (It's your guitar)
Get it girl, you know, fly like a shooting star (Like a shooting star)
Let the music take you (Let it take you)
Off the wall (Off the wall)
From the shadows (Uh huh, uh huh) to the spotlight
(From the shadows to the spotlight)
Lift it up now, she's flyin'
(Lift it up so, now she can fly)
Spinning 'round and 'round
She lifts her hands and closes her eyes
(She lifts her hands and closes her eyes)
It's got a hold of her and won't let go (You know)
It's in her heart, and, now it's in her soul!

Fly like a shooting star (Fly like a shooting star)
Let the music take you, off the wall

Reach for it, it's your guitar (It's your guitar)
Get it girl, you know, fly like a shooting star (Like a shooting star)
