Hey boy when you look at me
That way I can hardly breathe
I know your smile like that back of my hand
Do you understand?
Want you to be my man boy
Ain't no other one for me

Hmm, close enough to touch
Mmm, but still so far away
Ya probably neva' knew I felt this way

I wanna be the first thing on your mind in the mornin'
One who knows it's you when you're callin'
Girl who dries your tears when they fallin'
I wanna know you like that
I wanna be the one you run to when things get crazy
The only girl that you're call your baby
One who's only got your back
I wanna know you like that

I've been waitin' for so long and
What I'm feelin' is so strong
Don't leave me here on the edge of my dream
Will you'll be here for me?
Baby make me believe that you're comin' for me
You might also like
I tried to show you how I feel
But the words got in the way (Oh, no)
Still I gotta let you know
What I'm tryna say
Say!

I wanna be the first thing on your mind in the mornin' (I wanna be)
One who knows it's you when you're callin'
Girl who dries your tears when they fallin'
I wanna know you like that
I wanna be the one you run to when things get crazy
The only girl that you're call your baby
One who's only got your back
I wanna know you like that

I'll hold you down when times get rough
Teach you all about my love
'Cause half your heart just ain't enough to make me happy
Tell me 'bout your deepest dreams
Your hopes, your fears, and everything
(That's the way...)
'Cause that's the way it should be
Baby, you and me, hey, yeah
I wanna be the first thing on your mind in the mornin'
One who knows it's you when you're callin'
Girl who dries your tears when they fallin'
I wanna know you like that
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
I wanna be the first thing on your mind in the mornin'
One who knows it's you when you're callin'
Girl who dries your tears when they fallin'
I wanna know you like that
(I wanna know, I wanna know)

Uuh, I wanna know-
Wassup with you
I wanna be-
The one that you're turnin' to
I wanna have your back
Boy, I wanna know you like that
Woo!
Uuh, I wanna know-
Wassup with you
I wanna be-
The one that you're turnin' to
I wanna have your back
Boy, I wanna know you like that
I wanna know you like that!
Uuh, I wanna know-
Wassup with you
I wanna be-
The one that you're turnin' to
I wanna have your back
Boy, I wanna know you like that
Woo!
