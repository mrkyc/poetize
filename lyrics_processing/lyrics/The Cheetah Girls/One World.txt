Hey
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ka
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ka
Yay

Love always finds a way every single time
Once we learn to trust our hearts
(And know inside it feels right)
Now, we see who we are in a different light
We're not so far apart
(Anything is possible)

With all the differences, we're stronger here
Now the truth has been discovered, oh yeah
After all we've been through
Now, it's clear that all of us
We share

One world (One world)
One love (One love)
One and all (One and all)
We're a circle together
One world (One world)
One heart (One heart)
One song (One song)
Now and forever

Everybody celebrate
(Bring on the party, bring on the dance)
Time to let the music play
(The party never ends)
Every guy and every girl
(Stand up and shout, say it loud)
Everyone around the world
(Come on, and join in)

We're gathered here today
Everything just right
(Yeah)
'Cause when you give from the heart
The things you do come back to you
Dare to be strong and brave
Not afraid to try
That's when we see who we are
(The best of friends, and that is when)

With all the differences, we're stronger here (Stronger)
Now, the truth has been discovered, oh yeah
After all we've been through
Now, it's clear
We're all right here to share
One world (One world)
One love (One love (One love))
One and all (One and all)
We're a circle together (A circle together)
One world (One world)
One heart (One heart)
One song (One song, yeah)
Now and forever

Oh, I never knew that love
Would find a way to bring together both of us
Now inside, I know it's true
'Cause what we have is meant to be
You let me be the real me
Together, here, is where we belong
