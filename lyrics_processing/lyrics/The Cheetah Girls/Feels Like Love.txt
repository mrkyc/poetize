Feels like love
Feels like love
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

Ya got me spinnin' now
I feel your happiness all around
I'm not sure what I'm gettin' into
(Feels like love)
We're not the same, everybody knows
That's the best thing about us though
So hard to believe it, but it's true
(Feels like love)

We see the world in different ways
But I'm lovin' every minute of every day
Against the odds, we'll make it through

Maybe this could be
More than just fun
This could be everything that I want
What's happening to me?
Could you be the one?
This could be everything that I want
I didn't know how good it could be
And it feels like love to me
You might also like
Feels like love
Feels like love
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

I didn't know I could feel this way
It's a new world, baby, that's okay
You're like the part of me I never knew
(Feels like love)
You're the one I need next to me
But I know that it's hard to be
Livin' for everybody else but you
(Feels like love)

Real love's not supposed to be
Afraid of what everybody thinks
So let's show 'em all what we can do

Maybe this could be
More than just fun (More than just fun)
This could be everything that I want
(Everything that I want)
What's happening to me?
Could you be the one?
(Could you be the one?)
This could be everything that I want
I didn't know how good it could be (Could be)
And it feels like love to me (Love to me, ooh)
I've got to say it now
Seems too hard to do this
We've gotta work it out
Nothin' about us makes sense
I build the bridge from where I am to where you are
It shouldn't have to be this hard

(Ooh)
Maybe this could be
More than just fun
This could be everything that I want
(Everything that I want)
What's happening to me?
Could you be the one?
(The one I love)
This could be everything that I want
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I didn't know how good it could be (No, no)
And it feels like love (Like love) to me (To me)

Feels like love
Feels like love
It feels like love to me
Feels like love
(Like love, love)
Feels like love (Feels like love)
It feels like love to me
