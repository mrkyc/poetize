You didn't feel that?
It's an earthquake
I don't know what's goin' on
I didn't see anything on the news
It's an earthquake

You swept through like a heart attack
Oh, rest my heart and my mind
And I'm tryna get 'em back
Yes, I'd love to lick and love you like a piece of candy 'til my tooth goes, "crack"
Uh oh, I think this train is runnin' up the track, the track, the track, the track, boy

Boy, why can't you just settle it out?
When I'm up, you're touching the ground
Twist me and turn me until I say, "Ow!"
Every time I get back up, you push me right back down
Now, now, now

Baby, you're an earthquake
I can't get to shelter
Fasten up the window
What just happened?
Twist me, shake me, move me, break me, shock me, quake me
Baby, you're an earthquake!
Baby, you're an earthquake
I can't get to shelter
Fasten up the window
What just happened?
Twist me, shake me, move me, break me, shock me, quake me
Baby, you're an earthquake!
You might also like
You know that I can't fight you back
You get your kicks off with watchin' me fall like paper-stacks
Yeah, I see you, see you, see you like to get your, get your, get your kicks off that
Not fair!
I feel uneasy when I can relax, relax, relax, relax, boy

Boy, why can't you just settle it out?
When I'm up, you're touching the ground
Twist me and turn me until I say, "Ow!"
Every time I get back up, you push me right back down
Now, now, now

Baby, you're an earthquake
I can't get to shelter
Fasten up the window
What just happened?
Twist me, shake me, move me, break me, shock me, quake me
Baby, you're an earthquake!
Baby, you're an earthquake
I can't get to shelter
Fasten up the window
What just happened?
Twist me, shake me, move me, break me, shock me, quake me
Baby, you're an earthquake!
Talkin' about it just makes it feels worse
Can't ignore how I'm tumblin' down
And I feel so shook up
Can't compete with your love
Wind me up 'til I'm spinnin' around
Baby, you're an earthquake!

Baby, you're an earthquake
I can't get to shelter
Fasten up the window
What just happened?
Twist me, shake me, move me, break me, shock me, quake me
Baby, you're an earthquake!
Baby, you're an earthquake
I can't get to shelter
Fasten up the window
What just happened?
Twist me, shake me, move me, break me, shock me, quake me
Baby, you're an earthquake!
