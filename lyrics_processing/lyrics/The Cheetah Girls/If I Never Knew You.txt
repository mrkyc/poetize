If I never knew you, if I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of how precious life can be
And, if I never held you, I would never have a clue
How, at last, I'd find in you the missing part of me

In this world, so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear in your eyes
So, dry your eyes

And, I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through lost forever
If I never knew you

And, if I never knew you, I'd be safe, but half as real
Never knowing I could feel a love so strong and true

And, I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through lost forever
If I never knew you
You might also like
I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow, we'd make the whole world bright
I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us where these whispers in the night
But, still my heart is sayin' we were right

(Oh, oh-oh)
If I never knew you
(There's no moment I regret)
If I never knew your love
(Since the moment that we met)
I would have no inkling of how precious life can be
(If our time has gone too fast, I have lived at last)
Oh, oh-oh, yea-yea-yeah, yeah-ah, yeah

I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow, we'd make the whole world bright
I thought our love would be so beautiful
We'd turn the darkness into light
And, still my heart is sayin' we were right
We were right

And, if I never knew you (If I never knew you)
I'd have lived my whole life through-
Empty as the sky, never knowing why
Lost forever, if I never knew you
If I never knew you
Oh-oh
