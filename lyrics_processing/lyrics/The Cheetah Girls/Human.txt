I'm only human
I'm only... human

There comes a time
When you have to look back at your life
All the things you know that you have done
All the things that you've become
It's hard to say all the reasons that you walk away
Did you think that I was just too strong?
Well, let me tell you you were wrong

'Cause even though I made it on my own
Sometimes the world is cold standin' alone
I'm reachin' for a hand that I can hold
'Cause in the end, I'm only human
My heart's not made of steal
I'm lookin' for someone to break my shield (Break my shield)
'Cause even superheroes have to feel
And, in the end, I'm only human

I may stand my ground (My ground)
But doesn't mean my mind's not spinnin' 'round
Don't be decieved by who ya' think I am (No)
There's so much more ya' just don't understand
You might also likeHave you seen me cry?
Have you ever really looked into my eyes?
You would see the walls around me ain't that high
Did you ever really try?

'Cause even though I made it on my own (On my own)
Sometimes the world is cold standin' alone
I'm reachin' for a hand that I can hold (Hand to hold)
'Cause in the end, I'm only human
My heart's not made of steal (Made of steal, yeah)
I'm lookin' for someone to break my shield
'Cause even superheroes have to feel (Superheroes have to feel)
And, in the end, I'm only human

There's so many signs to me
So, don't be fooled by what you see
Underneath all of this lies
I'm human on the inside
I'm only human
I'm only human
I'm only human

'Cause even though I made it on my own (Whoa, yeah!)
Sometimes the world is cold standin' alone
I'm reachin' for a hand that I can hold
(I made it! Yes, I made it!)
'Cause in the end, I'm only human
My heart's not made of steal (My heart's not)
I'm lookin' for someone to break my shield
'Cause even superheroes have to feel
And, in the end, I'm only human (Human)
