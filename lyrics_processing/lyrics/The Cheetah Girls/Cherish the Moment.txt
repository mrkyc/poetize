Ooh baby, cherish the moment
La, la, la, la's...
You, you know the kind
That finger point and criticize
They can't see or read the signs
That life is really bigger than you and I
But in time (Oh time) they realize
They can't see through
We should all
Chorus:
Cherish the moment, live for today
We all get lost, just don't lose your way
We all love the sun, but we still need the rain
So what good is it to complain
It don't change a thing
In this world there's a flow
You can feel it if you just let go
And it wants to fill your heart
It will happen if you just don't try so hard
You might also likeBreak it down, hear the sound in your soul
Let it surround all of you, we should just...
Chorus
There's only so much time so why not enjoy it
Why not enjoy the ride, the ride
La, la, la, la's...
Ooh baby, cherish the moment
Chorus (Repeat 2x)
La, la, la, la's...
Ooh baby, cherish the moment
La, la, la, la's...
You, you know the kind
That finger point and criticize
They can't see or read the signs
That life is really bigger than you and I
But in time (Oh time) they realize
They can't see through
We should all
Chorus
In this world there's a flow
You can feel it if you just let go
And it wants to fill your heart
It will happen if you just don't try so hard
Break it down, hear the sound in your soul
Let it surround all of you, we should just...
Chorus
There's only so much time so why not enjoy it
Why not enjoy the ride, the ride
La, la, la, la's...
Ooh baby, cherish the moment
