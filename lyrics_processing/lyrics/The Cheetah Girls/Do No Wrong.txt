My baby's so fresh, yeah, he can do no wrong
He tells me I'm the best and tells the haters, "Be gone!"
If you don't already know, let me put you on
My baby's so fresh, yeah, he can do no wrong
(Now, get your hands off)

There ain't no doubt about it, my baby can do no wrong (Wrong)
They think I'm mad about it, I'm not, I just play along (Long)
Say what you want to, I'm convinced that he can do no wrong (Wrong)
I'll stop the world and tell 'em, "My baby can do no wrong."

Lookin' at us everywhere we go
People starin' like, "Can they roll?"
How we do it, they just don't know
I can tell they'll never get it
Lookin' at him, he's so sincere
Whisper nothing's up in my ear
They tell me leave him, but I don't care
My baby can do no wrong

Tell the operator there's a problem, problem, problem
They say my baby's lyin'
I ain't caught 'em, caught 'em, caught 'em
'Cause nothing in this world could, nothing that I heard should
Change the way I feel, because I got 'em, got 'em, got 'em
Tell the operator there's a problem, problem, problem
They say my baby's lyin'
I ain't caught 'em, caught 'em, caught 'em
'Cause nothing in this world could, nothing that I heard should
Change the way I feel, because I got 'em, got 'em, got 'em
You might also like
People, they talk because they're jealous of how tight we are (Are)
They see us everywhere, we ride around in fancy cars (Cars)
Say what you want to 'cause I don't believe 'em (-lieve 'em)
'Cause sometimes love don't have no rhyme or reason (Reason)
And I know they think it's madness and they tell me I should leave (Leave)
'Cause every time I see his smile, he puts my heart at ease (Ease)
So when they try to give advice and tell me what to do
Just keep on talkin', know that I ain't even hearin' you
