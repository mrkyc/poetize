Everybody tells me to let it go
I think they're crazy, they just don't know
I wish that they saw things the way that I do
I'm not that different, I'm just like you

I still run for shelter when the rain starts to fall
Sometimes I get mad over nothin' at all
But I can't let it break me, gotta give it my all
If I stand for nothin', then I fall

Sometimes up, sometimes down
Livin' my dreams with my feet on the ground
I'm not perfect, nobody is
I gotta break out this box ya try to keep me in
Whoa, whoa
Livin' my dreams with my feet on the ground
Whoa, whoa
Gotta break out this box ya try to keep me in

I'm my own burden, gotta carry the weight
Can't point the finger for my mistakes
I won't let no one tell me who I should be
'Cause at night, I answer to only me

I still run for shelter when the rain starts to fall
(Rain starts to fall)
Sometimes I get mad over nothin' at all
(Over nothin' at all)
But I can't let it break me, gotta give it my all
If I stand for nothin', then I fall

Sometimes up, sometimes down
Livin' my dreams with my feet on the ground
I'm not perfect, nobody is
I gotta break out this box ya try to keep me in
Whoa, whoa
Livin' my dreams with my feet on the ground
Whoa, whoa
Gotta break out this box ya try to keep me in

If I wait around and let somebody tell me how to live
(If I let somebody), I'll be invisible
Won't let you hold me back
Won't let you keep me boxed in

Even though I'm sometimes up, I'm sometimes down
Livin' my dreams with my feet on the ground
I'm not perfect, nobody is
I gotta break out this box ya try to keep me in!
Sometimes up, sometimes down
Livin' my dreams with my feet on the ground
I'm not perfect, nobody is
I gotta break out this box ya try to keep me in
Whoa, whoa
Livin' my dreams with my feet on the ground
Whoa, whoa
