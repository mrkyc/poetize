Hey!

Who you gon' run to? (Ooh ooh) Where you gon' hide? (Hey)

Hey boy, I know I got you thinkin' that I'm huntin' you down
But I ain't trippin' that your girl just talkin' to you out loud
When my girls were with you, you wouldn't despite me
So you fooled yourself to call his money
But don't get mad cauze you started this thang
I loved you till you tried to play me lame
So you keep pinnin' your pretty face and big balls, just remember I'm gon' get my cash

Well, you was out trickin' the trick is on you, you were good at it girl but now look at you
I was your back bone, cover zone, now you feelin' all alone, lookin' like you lost a bone, no place to call home
Did you really think that I wouldn't know
Feelin' silly cause you got whipped yo'
Caught up in a mission that you can't get out of
I'm a hot girl baby, can't cool me down
You might also like
So you caught up in a situation, can't get out
You been dippin' and whippin' with a freak from out of town
I'm a hot girl baby, can't cool me down
Now you want to duck and hide without makin' a sound
Won't return my phone calls, to your boys you a playa
But they want me so they hit me with every move that you makin' leavin' out no details or even a clue
How you so fresh and so clean in the peices I got you
