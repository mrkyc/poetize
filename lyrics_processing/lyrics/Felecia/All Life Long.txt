Yeah, Mo' Thug

C'mon
 2x  (Layzie bone)
All life long
Can we be in this forever?
All life long
(Our love lasts life long)

They say that opposites, attract
And I believe, that ain't nothin' wrong with that
Cause you're the thug that I love and I'm down for mine
I'll be there when you call at the drop of a dime

I never woulda thought that I'd be your kind
You so sexy, you so fine
You play the front and I'll play behind
But lately you always on my mind
You the sun and you like to shine
But I'm here to let you know
I'm the moon and I like to glow
But I be that thug for you fa sho
You might also like
Will you ride for me?

Always

Will you die for me?

Constantly

Stay tru to me?

Util my dyin' day
And I'll do anything you want cause you my lady, hey
 2x

If bein' a thug in love is a crime
They might as well take me to jail
They might as well throw away the key
Cause livin' with out you was hell
Wear my ring and be my queen
I'm yo king it's like a dream
Funny thing, how life can bring
Together untouchable teams
Nothing or no one
Can take your place (that's right)
With you by my side
Anything, I can face
You keep it tight
And you got my devotion
Just from me, I'm just tellin' you this
Just to go through the motion

Will you ride for me?

Always

Will you die for me?

Constantly

Stay tru to me?

Until my dyin' day
I'll do anything you want cause your my baby
 2x

From sun up to sun
I promise to down
I ain't ashamed to show it
I'll let the whole world know it

I can dig it
I'm wit it
It's L-O-V-E
Little Lay and Fe-Fe
Two deep when we creep
Like Bonnie and Clyde
We ride wit a heat
Still flossin' off in these streets

Now follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Take this riding ecxtasy
The magic takes me
His and her Bentleys'

Ya spoil me with loyalty
Thanks for the watch with rocks like boulders
When you need to lean baby this your shoulder
When you feel horny I got somethin' for ya girl

Ooh now ya talkin' (now ya talkin')
And I be lovin' the way when we be lockin' (uh hunh)
We be so good as a team
We even jockin'

Forever we keepin' it on and poppin'
Haters is watchin' and it ain't no stoppin' us
