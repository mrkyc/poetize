Bam-bam, ooh, ooh, ooh
Bam-bam, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

It's cool if we ain't got everything figured out
'Cause love ain't got all the answers, baby
This place we in, they don't ever really told me 'bout it
But that don't mean we can't navigate it

It's unpredictable, but I feel so good about it
A mountain, but we can climb it
Ain't no way to get around it
Take this open road
And I wanna get it right
We can't win if we don't try
And I'm scared, I can't deny

Well if it ain't enough, we just gonna give up?
It ain't easy tryna stay in love
Are we gonna walk out when it rains?
Tell me we got enough of our love to keep us together (Say that we got enough)
Say we got enough of our love to keep us together
You might also like
Arguments, back and forth, disagreements, yeah
Can we make it up, make it right, can we fix it? (Ooh)
'Cause it ain't always gon' be perfect, baby
It's gon' be crazy, we fight
I'm wrong, you're right, maybe, sometimes

It's unpredictable, but I feel so good about it
A mountain, but we can climb it
Ain't no way to get around it
Take this open road
And I wanna get it right
We can't win if we don't try
And I'm scared, I can't deny

Well if it ain't enough, we just gonna give up?
It ain't easy tryna stay in love
Are we gonna walk out when it rains?
Tell me we got enough of our love to keep us together (Say that we got enough)
Say we got enough of our love to keep us together

Say we got enough, say we got enough
Of our love, of our love
Say we got enough, say we got enough
Of our love, of our love
Say we got enough, say we got enough
Of our love, of our love (Say that we got enough)
Say we got enough, say we got enough
Of our love, yeah
Well if it ain't enough, we just gonna give up?
It ain't easy tryna stay in love
Are we gonna walk out when it rains? (No, no, no)
Tell me we got enough of our love to keep us together (Say that we got enough)
Say we got enough of our love to keep us together

Tell me we got enough (Say we got enough, say we got enough)
Of our love (Of our love, of our love)
To keep us (Say we got enough, say we got enough)
Uh, together (Of our love, our love)
Say we got enough (Say we got enough, say we got enough)
Of our love (Of our love, of our love)
To keep us together (Say we got enough, say we got enough)
