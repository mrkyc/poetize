The girl who always says yes wants to scream no
Takes over everyone's stress, huh, ignores her own
The life and soul of the party, but loves to stay home
She says she's not brokenhearted, but cries on her own

Playin' pretend, I shouldn't hide it
It isn't right, bein' a liar
I'm crossin' the line, dancin' with fire
When I'm not fine, should I deny it?

'Cause I'm goin' crazy when I'm not okay
I keep prayin' that the cracks don't show my pain, huh
'Cause even when I'm fallin', I say my life is like a dream, huh
But I'm fightin' through a nightmare
'Cause I'm not really being me (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
So you don't really know me, huh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

The girl who starts all the jokes, just make her laugh
Preaches the dos and the don'ts, but loves to be bad
Smiles when they guess who she's lovin', what they say makes her mad
She says "I'm fine, I need nothing," but she hopes for your hand
