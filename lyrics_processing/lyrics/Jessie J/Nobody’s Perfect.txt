When I'm nervous, I have this thing, yeah, I talk too much
Sometimes I just can't shut the hell up
It's like I need to tell someone
Anyone who'll listen
And that's where I seem to fuck up
Yeah, I forget about the consequences
For a minute there, I lose my senses
And in the heat of the moment, my mouth starts going
The words start flowing, oh

But I never meant to hurt you
I know it's time that I learnt to
Treat the people I love like I wanna be loved
This is a lesson learned

I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken
Don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody's perfect, no

If I could turn back the hands of time
I swear, I never would've crossed that line
I should've kept it between us
But, no, I went and told the whole world how I'm feeling, and oh
So I sit, and I realize
With these tears falling from my eyes
I gotta change if I wanna keep you forever
I promise that I'm gonna try

But I never meant to hurt you
I know it's time that I learnt to
Treat the people I love like I wanna be loved
This is a lesson learned

I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken
Don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody's perfect, no
I'm not a saint, no, not at all
But what I did, it wasn't cool
But I swear that I'll never do that again to you, oh
I'm not a saint, no, not at all
But what I did, it wasn't cool
But I swear that I'll never do that again to you, yeah

I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken
Don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect, no
And I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken
Don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect, yeah, yeah, whoa

Don't tell me, don't tell, don't tell me you can't forgive me
No, no, no, no
