Welcome to this life
Every day and night
I can feel the lights
Hands up, glory
I will stand and fight
Gotta do what's right
I can feel the lights
Hands up, glory

Gotta talk about today
The dark and evil ways
Of the man who's in display
Let's pray (Let's pray)
He believes his game to say
Power, money, greed, and fame
Lead the innocence to the grave
Let's pray (Let's pray)

Hate that I can feel him on me
His dirty energy
He's a heavy sound, so cold and loud
Making noise, not history
I know it ain't right, hatin'
But I know I'm not alone
You say that you a leader
But I won't ever believe you
You will say, "Yes," we say, "No"

Welcome to this life
Every day and night
I can feel the lights
Hands up, glory
I will stand and fight
Gotta do what's right
I can feel the lights
Hands up, glory

I never dreamt it up this way
His hope jumped into play
We can make it better, it has to change
Let's pray, let's pray
It's real life, we can't escape
So we gotta fix it, not run away
His sin will never ever kill my faith
Let's pray, let's pray

Hate that I can feel him on me
His dirty energy
He's a heavy sound, so cold and loud
Making noise, not history
I know it ain't right, hatin'
But I know I'm not alone
You say that you a leader
But I won't ever believe you
You will say, "Yes," we say, "No"
