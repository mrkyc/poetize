Why does it feel like I'm living through ya?
Tell me why I'm addicted to ya
'Cause I don't even know
Chasin' this 'cause we think we want it
But we can't breathe 'cause the air is toxic
So tell me where to go

It's a thin, thin line
To admit or deny, yeah, yeah
Ours is a different kind of love
It used to be saving us
Now it's just breaking us
It's not about just giving up
We know we're not safe enough

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, get away-y-y
Get away, get away, get away (Mm)

Do I stay 'cause you say you need me?
I crave it more when it isn't easy
How am I supposed to grow? (Mm, huh)
It won't fix 'cause I say I love you
I need to show you but I don't know how to
How am I supposed to grow? (Mm)
