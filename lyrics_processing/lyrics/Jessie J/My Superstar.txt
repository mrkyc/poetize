Oh oh, oh Sid
Sid, baby, you make me so happy

Oh I, never knew I
Would make it out and come this far
Oh I, never knew I
Would see the day we'd come together

Oh it's not like anything I've ever felt before
Yeah, baby

You, you make me happy
You keep me laughing
You make my world a better place
You, you are my rainbow
You colour my day so bright
I want to stay forever with
My superstar, my superstar
You shine so bright into my heart
My superstar, my superstar
You shine so bright into my heart

Stick together like superglue
We got the moves like Yeah
But shining bright, throw your hands up to the blue sky

Oh I, never knew I
Would have it all, would have it all
Oh I, never knew I
Would feel so good, would feel the fall
Oh I, never knew I
Would live the dream, it's so surreal
Oh I, never knew I
Would see the day we'd come together

Oh it's like anything I've felt before, before, before

You, you make me happy
You keep me laughing
You make my world a better place
You, you are my rainbow
You colour my day so bright
I want to stay forever with
