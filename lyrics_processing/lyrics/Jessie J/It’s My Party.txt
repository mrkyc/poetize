(Ah-ha-ha)
Let's go!

You're stuck in the playground
And I'm a grown woman now
Considering you hate me
You're stalking like you made me

So why you acting like you're tough?
By now I thought you'd had enough
Don't you get tired of being rude?
(Awe, come and give me a hug, dude)
Let's go!

It's my party
I'll do, do what I want (Do, do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I'll keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going 'til I say, "stop"
If you are wondering if I give a damn, well, I do not ('Cause)
It's my party, I'll do, do what I want (Do, do what I want)
Woah-oh! (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh!)
Woah-oh! (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh!)
You might also like
I think it's time you realize
You're only wasting your time
Addicted to attention
You need an intervention

So why you acting like you're sick?
Sitting around and talking shh
Don't you get tired of being alone?
(Awe, your only friend is your phone)
Ow!

It's my party
I'll do, do what I want (Do, do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I'll keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going 'til I say, "stop"
If you were wondering if I give a damn, well, I do not ('Cause)
It's my party, I'll do, do what I want (Do, do what I want)
Woah-oh! (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh!)
Woah-oh! (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh!)

You think I speak too much? (I don't care, don't care)
You think I tweet too much? (I don't care, don't care)
You think my clothes are crazy? (I don't care, don't care)
Well, maybe I'm crazy... cray, cray, cray, go!
It's my party, I'll do, do what I want (Do, do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I'll keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going 'til I say, "stop"
If you were wondering if I give a damn, well, I do not
It's my party, I'll do, do what I want (Do, do what I want)
Woah-oh! (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh!)
