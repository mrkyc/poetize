I show up, the glow up
Blossom little rose
You are the most beautiful when you're buddin' new (Hmm)
I pray up, I stay up
What is life with all the clues?
Sometimes I don't know what to do and that's alright

I make money, share my time
I need something to be mine
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me
I'm impatient, give me space
Always working far away
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me

Please don't be so hard
So hard on my heart
I'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms
Please don't be so cold
Be patient while I grow
I wanna try, I won't always get it right but I need you to know
To go easy on me
Go easy, go easy on me
Go easy

I gave up, I got up
I'm my daddy's little girl
Hear my mother in my words, I'm staying true
You know what? It's all love
Trust me when I say it's not you
Just try to see my point of view, this shit gets hard

I make money, share my time
I need something to be mine
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me
I'm impatient, give me space
Always working far away
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me

Please don't be so hard (Be so hard)
So hard on my heart (On my heart)
I'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms
Please don't be so cold (Be so cold)
Be patient while I grow (While I grow)
I wanna try, I won't always get it right but I need you to know
To go easy on me
Go easy, go easy on me
Go easy
Go easy
Go easy on me
Go easy
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Go easy)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Go easy)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la (On me)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Go easy)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Go easy)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la (On me)

Oh, please don't be so hard
So hard on my heart
I'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms
Go easy on me
Go easy on me
Go easy on me

Alright, darling, . Take it easy, don't over do it; do it, but don't abuse yourself, alright?
(Okay)
