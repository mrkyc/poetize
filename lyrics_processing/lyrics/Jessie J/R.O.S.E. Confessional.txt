"I don't wanna make music anymore"
I said that out loud, wow
Then I tried to stop and I didn't know how to
Because it's impossible to walk away from true love
Art, emotion, lyrics, music, feeling
It's what I need to survive
Man, that pain woke me up
It's inside-out, you know?
I don't do this because I want to do it
I do it because I have to
I feel everything so deeply
It's a blessing and a curse
And I lost my passion to create
To draw a line between business and art
I'd fallen into darkness and allowed myself to be led by fear
The fear was keeping other people happy, who didn't ever care about me
And I was running deeper into someone and something I, I wasn't
How did that become more important than my light?
At the time, I couldn't find that question
I really thought it was more important
I'd forgotten what made me special
I was lost in what I stood for
And I was desperately trying to reach out for something or someone, but I couldn't feel
It didn't feel like there was anyone there
But there was, I was there
Love was there
I was there, I never left
I just gave someone my magic, and they didn't look after it
And in all the power I felt was lost, it was never gone
The one thing that started this whole journey could never be taken away from me: My voice
I started to just write words and sing
Just like I did when I was sixteen
No singles, no hooks, no pressure
Just me, my feelings, and being real
And I started to feel it
I started to feel it coming back
The music I said I didn't wanna make is what brought me back to life
The anger, the honesty, the heartache
The pain, the joy, the strength, the love
It all happened for a reason
The teaching and the lesson
The words I kept coming back to:
Realisations, obsessions, sex, and empowerment
"R.O.S.E."
For each letter, there is a word
And for each word is a song I will share with you
I'm strong enough now to let you in
To be real and to be free
My mother is called Rose
She gave me the gift of life
A rose is at its most beautiful when budding new
I rose above the pain
We give roses or a single rose as a gift for so many different feelings
