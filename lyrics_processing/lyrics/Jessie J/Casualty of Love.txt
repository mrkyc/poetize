We may not have all the answers
Oh, I know that we can change some of the things that are beyond our control
And the vision of us may be blurry, but use your heart to see
Just follow the beat
The rhythm will lead you right back to me

Sometimes it's a game of give and take
It's easy to break, but hold on and wait
Have a little faith

I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, if by chance I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love

(Love, love, love, love)
Casualty
(Love, love, love, love)
Casualty
Casualty of, a casualty of love

The battle of us could be simple
Escape, without being hurt
'Cause love is our shield
Keeps us concealed from what could get even worse
So baby, let me be your soldier
Don't be overtaken by pride
Just close your eyes, take my hand
Promise to keep us alive

All is fair in love and war
Knock me down, and I'll get back up wanting more
Through the fire and rain
It makes me numb from the pain
That's the price, that's the price I'll pay

And I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll, I'll stand up tall, and baby, if I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love

(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
Casualty, casualty
(Love, love, love, love)
Casualty of, a casualty of love
