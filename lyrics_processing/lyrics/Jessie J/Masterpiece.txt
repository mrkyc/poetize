So much pressure, why so loud?
If you don't like my sound, you can turn it down
I got a road, and I walk it alone
Uphill battle, I look good when I climb
I'm ferocious, precocious, I get braggadocios
I'm not gonna stop, I like the view from the top (Yeah, hey)

You talk that blah-blah, that la-la, that rah-rah, shh
And I'm so done, I'm so over it (Ah)
Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I hit and miss
But I'm okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't colour inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greats
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece, and I

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-aah
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-aah

Those who mind don't matter
Those who matter don't mind
If you don't catch what I'm throwing
Then I leave you behind, gone in a flash
And I am living like that (Yeah)

They talk that blah blah, that la la, that rah rah shhh
Go with the punches, and take the hits (Ah)
Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I swing and miss
But it's okay, I'm cool with this

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't colour inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece, and I

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-aah
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-aah
I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't colour inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
Masterpiece, masterpiece, yeah

I still fall on my face sometimes (Sometimes)
And I can't colour inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete (I'm perfectly incomplete)
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest (Oh, with the greatest)
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me (The best of me)
I'm still working on my masterpiece, and I (I'm still working on my masterpiece)

Ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-aah (Ooh)
Ooh-ooh (Still working on, still working on)
Ooh-aah
