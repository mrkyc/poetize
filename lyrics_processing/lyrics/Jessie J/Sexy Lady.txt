You're feeling nervous
Having your doubts
Don't be embarrassed if you don't fit in the crowd
Keep standing tall and hold your ground
Show 'em it's not okay to let 'em kick you down

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't let 'em ruin your time
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's now or never, never
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just let 'em know it's your life
So do it, use it, flaunt it, own it
Uh-huh, that's right

Yeah, you better give it everything you got
Hey, just show 'em you're a sexy lady
Yeah, you better work it 'til it's burning hot
Hey, just show 'em you're a sexy lady
Time is now, baby
Look around, baby
Just be proud, you're a sexy lady
Work it out, baby
Play it loud, baby
Just be proud, all my sexy ladies
