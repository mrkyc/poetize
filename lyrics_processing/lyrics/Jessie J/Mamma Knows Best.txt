Yeah
Woo!

Wow, there is somethin' goin' down
Like the storm in the sky, ooh
I ain't gonna be played by your behavior
How can I trust someone who's lyin' to me?

So, bow out, go
Now, I said, bow out and leave
I said take your stuff, and go
'Cause you're not for me, no

Mamma knows best when times get hard
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See, Mamma knows best when, ha, I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my feet on solid ground
Yeah

See, I ain't no new old rag doll that you can pick up and drop
And all of this inconsistent love, yeah
I think it's time that it S-T-O, stops

Mamma knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh

To bring me up and always keep my feet on solid ground
Yeah

"Just be the best," my daddy said to me
"Always use humor as your therapy, yeah-yeah
Don't ever take life too seriously
Just do you, 'cause you do you so perfectly"

Ohh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
See, mamma, mamma knows best
See, daddy, daddy knows best
See mamma, mama knows

So bring me up and always keep my feet on the ground
