Mmm, yeah, yeah

I've carried this load for way too long
I couldn't let you go, under a spell of don't, don't, don't
Ego reaction, guess I was holding up face
By saving your ass, you spent my money and I lost their faith

I screamed, "Yes," you told me, "Nah"
You fed me fear, I spoke to God
I was living my dreams through your eyes
Building my life on your lies, yeah

You just laughed when I cried
Think about that
Who lives the real sacrifice?
Think about that
Think about that, huh
Think about
Think about that, wow

All you disturb is my work and my patience
Years of grindin', you took it, you broke it and all 'cause you fake it
You wanna be famous, say it, you wanna be famous
Using my juice, was thirsty as fuck, always late, always faded

I screamed, "Yes," you told me, "Nah"
You fed me fear, I spoke to God
I was living my dreams through your eyes
Building my life on your lies, yeah

You just laughed when I cried
Think about that
Who lives the real sacrifice?
Think about that
Think about that, huh
Think about
Think about that
Think about that
Think about that

Think about that time when you blamed me
Think about that time when I called you up
And I said I needed saving
Think about that time when you said you cared
You were lying, tryna faze me (Yeah, yeah)
Think about that time when I got sick
And you made me go on stage
And think about that time when you used my fate
To stack up on your paper (Yeah)
Think about that time you told my label lies
You said, "She's crazy"
Think about the fact they see it now (Yeah)
You're a shark, a cheat, a traitor (A shark, a cheat, a traitor)
Think about that
Think about that
Think about (Hey)
Think about it
Think about it (Oh, no)
Think about that (Yeah)
