It's not fair
I'm talking to you upstairs
Are you there?
You know I care
So please don't tell me that this is an empty prayer
Oh, no

'Cause all she has and all she's lost
I wish she could remember
I watch her fade and slip away
It's hurting more than ever

I miss her
Even though she's still here
You need to listen
Don't let her disappear
I'll give her my forever
If it meant for a day she could really be okay
'Cause I miss her
Even though she's still here

Is this pretend?
Will she really not know my face
In the end?
If you're a friend, a friend, a friend
Show me how to heal it when she can't even feel it
Please, show me
You might also like
'Cause all she has and she's lost
I wish she could remember
I watch her fade and slip away
It's hurting more than ever

I miss her even though she's still here
You need to listen
Don't let her disappear
I'd give her my forever
If it meant for a day she can really be okay
'Cause I miss her

And promise me this
When she goes
Everything she sees will set her free
Thirteen and the color green
Promise me this
That she knows
That the people that she loves
Will love her in the skies above

I miss her
Even though she's still here
You need to listen
So don't let her disappear
I'd give her my forever, forever, forever
If it meant for a day she could really be okay
'Cause I miss her
Even though she's still here
She's still here, oh
I miss her, I miss her miss her
I just miss her, I miss her, miss her
I miss her
