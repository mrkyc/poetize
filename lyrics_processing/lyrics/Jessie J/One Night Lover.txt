It's about time that I see
There's so much more to me
Than just being your one night lover
I'm just losing sleep
Please just let me be
I can't be your one night lover

We broke up almost a year ago
You hit me up, say, "I'm down the road
I'm coming over because I'm feeling low"
I hate that you know when I'm home
Lights off, light the fire
Why do I let you in?
You kiss my neck, then we fuck (Ah)
Then you leave again
Who we fooling?
How we gon' be normal friends
When you just want me when I'm home?

You know I'm there for ya
You know I'm there
I love the shit out of you
But this ain't fair
You know I care for you
You know I care
But you broke my, broke my heart
And this ain't, this ain't fair
You might also like
It's about time that I see
There's so much more to me
Than just being your one night lover (One night lover)
I'm just losing sleep
Please just let me be
I can't be your one night lover (One night lover)

I can't, I can't, I can't be that girl (Hell naw)
I can't, I can't (One night lover)
I can't, I can't, if I'm not your girl (Hell naw)
I can't, I can't (One night lover)

You come back when you know there's someone else
You don't want me, you just want me by myself
So when you want it, you can take me off the shelf
Dust me off when I get home
It hurts too much to switch it off and just be cool
I can't do it, because I'm still in love with you
Hardest thing, hardest thing to ever do
To be alone when I get home

You know I'm there for ya
You know I'm there
I love the shit out of you
But this ain't fair
You know I care for you
You know I care
But you broke my, broke my heart
And this ain't, this ain't fair
It's about time that I see
There's so much more to me
Than just being your one night lover
I'm just losing sleep
Please just let me be
I can't be your one night lover

I can't, I can't, I can't be that girl (Hell naw)
I can't, I can't (One night lover)
I can't, I can't, if I'm not your girl (Hell naw)
I can't, I can't (One night lover)

I'm worth more than this
Blow us out, make a wish
Lord, let me survive without his loving
It started with a kiss
We had a whirlwind kind of trip
But it's goodbye, it's back to being nothing
It's better for us both, I think, for us to let us go
It's been so long, my heart feels like it's running
But I won't wait around to be crowned the lost and found (No)
So it's goodbye, it's back to being nothing
It's about time that I see (It's about time)
There's so much more to me (So much more)
Than just being your one night lover (One night lover)
I'm just losing sleep (I'm just losing sleep)
Please just let me be (Please just let me be)
I can't be your one night lover (One night lover)

I can't, I can't, I can't be that girl (Hell naw)
I can't, I can't (One night lover)
I can't, I can't, if I'm not your girl (Hell naw)
