Sometimes I'm mad at the world, mad at this town
Mad 'cause I can't lose the same five pounds
That I've been tryin' to lose for three or four years now
Sometimes I feel like a truck that just won't run
On the side of the road in the July sun
There ain't another car for miles that I can thumb down

I guess every now and then
You're going to land on a bad day
Though I still do, I know I can't complain

'Cause I love what I do, love where I'm at
Love a strong cup of coffee and my ol' black hat
My big wool blanket
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots
I love my old bird dog, I like to watch him run
My red guitar, I bang around on some
And I love, lovin' you, baby, I love lovin' you

Now, heaven to me, it's a simple thing
It's just you and me and a phone that don't ring
Popcorn poppin' on a lay around Friday night
Seein' you smile when I wake up
The way you slide to the middle of my pickup truck
The way you say, "baby, it's all gonna be alright"
When I walk in at the end of a worn out day
And I see you, baby, how can I complain
You might also like
'Cause I love what I do, love where I'm at
Love a strong cup of coffee and my ol' black hat
My big wool blanket
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots
I love my old bird dog, I like to watch him run
My red guitar, I bang around on some
And I love, lovin' you, baby, I love lovin' you
Yes I Do

Well, I love where I've been
But I don't look back
I thank God for the life He lets me have
My big wool blanket
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots
I love my old bird dog, I like to watch him run
My red guitar I bang around on some
And I love loving you, baby, I love lovin' you
Yeah baby, I love, oh yes, I do, love lovin' you
I love my old bird dog
