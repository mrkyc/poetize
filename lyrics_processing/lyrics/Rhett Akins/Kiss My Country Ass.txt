Tearnin' down a dirt road, rebel flag flyin'
'Coon dog in the back
Truck bed loaded down with beer
And a cold one in my lap
Earnhardt sticker behind my head
And my woman by my side
Tail pipe's poppin', the radio's rockin'
"Country Boy Can Survive"
Well, if you got a problem with that
You can kiss my country ass

Well, I love turkey calls, overalls
Wrangler jeans, smoke nothin' but Marlboro Reds
Tattoos up and down my arms
And deer heads over my bed
My granddaddy fought in World War II
And my Daddy went to Vietnam
And I ain't scared to grab my gun
And fight for my homeland
If you don't love the American flag
You can kiss my country ass

If you're a downhome, backwoods redneck
C'mon, stand up and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass
You might also like
Well, there's a whole lotta high class people out there
That's lookin' down on me
'Cause the country club where I belong
Is the honky-tonk 'til three in the mornin'
Don't wear no fancy clothes
No ties or three-piece suits
You can find me in my camouflage hat
My t-shirt and cowboy boots
If that don't fit your social class
You can kiss my country ass

If you're a downhome, backwoods redneck
C'mon, stand up and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass

'Cause I'm a front porch sittin'
Guitar pickin', moonshine sippin'
'Bacca juice spittin' country boy from the woods
And I love fried chicken and blue gill fishin'
And outlaw women, and I wouldn't change if I could
I ain't tryin' to start no fight but I'll finish one every time
So you just mind your own damn business
And stay the hell outta mine
If you got a problem with that
You can kiss my country ass
I said, if you got a problem with any of that
You can kiss my natural born
Redneck to the bone
