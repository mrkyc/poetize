There was a cloud of dust down Lonesome Road one full moon Friday night
The county sheriff and old man Jones had a feelin' that it wasn't right
So they followed a beer can trail and it took them to the river bank
There was girls and guys and four wheel drives and 500 watts of Hank

Well that sheriff was packin' a .44 and he shot it up into the air
He said you on private property people better move it on out of here
Then a blue-eyed cutie with a wiggly walk come slidin' up next to him
She said, "There ain't no way you are gettin' us out, so you might as well come on in."

She said, "It's Friday night in Dixie, it's time to have some fun
Anything goes 'til the rooster crows and we see that southern sun
We're gonna party down to that country sound, you know what I'm talkin' about
'Cause it's Friday night in Dixie can't hold it in, let it all hang out."

Well the sheriff searched all the pickup trucks to see what he could find
Some shotgun shells an old buck knife and a mason jar of shine
Then Billy jumped up in the back of his truck and said, "Sheriff I do confess
Well I stole that jar from old man Jones 'cause I heard that he made the best."
Well the sheriff put down his pistol looked over at old man Jones
"Said it's up to you what you want to do lock them up or leave 'em alone?"
Well that old man said, "I sure have done my share of raisin' hell
And I ain't too old to raise it with y'all then he let out a rebel yell

He said, "It's Friday night in Dixie, it's time to have some fun

Well it's Friday night in Dixie can't hold it in, Lord, let it all hang out."

You know it's Friday night in Dixe and we're gonna have some fun
'Cause anything goes 'til the rooster crows and we feel that southern sun
We're gonna party down to that country sound, you know what I'm talkin about

Yeah let it all hang out
