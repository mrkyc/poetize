This one was postmarked Santa Fe
All she had to say
Was thanks for giving her the space
She was needing
Got out all her other cards tonight
And I've been pouring over every line
But the more I do the less I think I like
What I'm reading
There isn't one "wish you were here"
"I miss you my dear"
"I want you to know, I can't wait to come home"
Not one single line saying distance and time
Is making her see, I'm really all that she needs
With every picture postcard she sends
There's a picture I'm starting to get
That feeling for me, I hope it's there in her heart
It's not meant to be, no it's not in the cards
Here's one I got a week ago
From Ensenada, Mexico
Where there should've been an I love you
She wrote Adios at the bottom
I'd try to reach her if I thought it would help
But the cards are speaking for themselves
And I've got to play
Although the hand she dealt
Ain't a hot one

That feeling for me, I hope it's there in her heart
It's not meant to be, no it's not in the cards
Oh no no, yeah yeah
With every picture postcard she sends

It's not meant to be, no it's not in the card
Oh no no, no it's not in the cards
