But since you asked and I've got a minute well gentlemen here's the deal
If I told it's as good as this or that you might misunderstand
So let me give you all a little idea of what's it's better than
It's better than whiskey when you're cold
Better then your favorite song on the your radio
Better than a feather bed when you've been loving all night
And you're got to get some rest
Better than punching out on payday
And cruise control down the highway
It's a whole lot better then it used to be
And it used to be the best
Now I've seen love that started to fade soon after that first kiss
But let me make it clear right now that ain't the case with this
It started out good, started getting better It never has slowed down
And it's better than a bunch of you buying me another round
It's better than whiskey when you're cold
Better then your favorite song on the your radio
Better than a feather bed when you've been loving all night
And you're got to get some rest
Better than punching out on payday
And cruise control down the highway
It's a whole lot better then it used to be
And it used to be the best

And what we've got has got to be one hundred times better than
It's better than whiskey when you're cold
Better then your favorite song on the your radio
Better than a feather bed when you've been loving all night
And you're got to get some rest
Better than punching out on payday
And cruise control down the highway
It's a whole lot better then it used to be
And it used to be the best
Yeah, it's a whole lot better then it used to be
