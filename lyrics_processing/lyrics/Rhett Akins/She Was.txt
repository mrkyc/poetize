Tough guy on the outside
Always been the story of my life
No one ever got the best of me
Thought I Was In Control Of My Destiney
But On The Inside I Was Gun Shy
Never Could Look Love In The Eye
Tryed To Keep My Heat Protected
Then Came The Unexpected
I Remember The Moment I Saw
Forever Comin' Into View

She was standin' there like an angel shinin'
Sent to me with perfect timin'
The only one that could turn my life around
She Was Sunlight on a cloudy mornin'
Shelter when the rain was pourin'
One heart that would never let me down
Oh it's hard to believe she was born to be with me
But she was

I've Been Down All The Wrong Roads
I've Every Way The Wind Blows
So Lost That I Couldn't Be Found
But Love Has A Way Of Trackin' you Down
The Right Place The Right Time
One Look She Stoll This Heart Of Mine
And I Knew It Was Never Endin'
And Ever Night When Im Holdin' Her Close I Knew It Was Never Endin
And Every Night When Im Holding Her Close
I Thank Heaven Above
