Well, it was January, not the fourth of July
A snow white morning and a clear blue sky
We were miles from nowhere, but somehow or 'other, love found us
Yeah, we were laughing and looking in each other's hearts
Talkin' and touchin' and trying so hard
Not to notice what was going on all around us

There were fireworks flashing and thunder clapping
Big waves crashing on the shore
There were church bells ringing and angels singing
All gathered around Heaven's door
Then we kissed and I saw the light
I could go on about this all night
Hey, darlin', if you don't want to hear how the waters parted
Then don't get me started

No, don't get me started, I'm warning you
Unless you've got an extra week or two
You know darn well how I get when you get me goin'
No, don't get me taking 'bout us
About the day we fell in love
Unless you're longing for a dose of strong emotion
You might also like
'Cause there were fireworks flashing and thunder clapping
And big waves crashing on the shore
There were church bells ringing and angels singing
All gathered 'round Heaven's door
Then we kissed and I saw the light
I could go on about this all night
Hey, darlin', if you don't want to hear how the waters parted
Then don't get me started

Then we kissed and I saw the light
I could go on about this all night
Hey, darlin', if you don't want to hear how the waters parted
Then don't get me started (Don't get me started)

There were fireworks flashing and thunder clapping
Big waves crashing on the shore (Don't get me started)
There were church bells ringing and angels singing
All gathered 'round Heaven's door
There were fireworks flashing and thunder clapping
