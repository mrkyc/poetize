Never went to college
'Cept the parties I was playin' for, the Sigma Kappa ladies on Friday nights
So I spent a lot of weekends
With some future doctor's girlfriend
And I learned there's people who don't like
People like me

Don't get the big promotions, no
Cause we seem to like the gene that puts the filter in between, our brain and mouth
We don't smile and say yes
When everybody knows its BS
And I've learned there's people who don't like
People like me

People like me
Livin' hard
Lovin' fast
Check a cheque
Milk and gas in the truck
Head to town a little luck
Lost and found
Time to waste
It's Sammy's place they all say "hey!"
Come on in and grab a seat
It sure feels good to be
With people like me

Been told we need to grow up
They say there's more to life than cars, pretty women and guitars
I say like what
I love God and country
I'll do what they ask of me
But I know there's people who don't like

People like me
Livin' hard
Lovin' fast
Check a cheque
Milk and gas in the truck
Head to town a little luck
Lost and found
Time to waste
It's Sammy's place they all say "hey!"
Come on in and grab a seat
It sure feels good to be
With people like me

People like me
Crankin' up
Kickin' back
Dirty joke
Make me laugh
Buyin' suds for my friends
And the girls that just walked in
Jukebox plays
What's your name we all say "hey!"
Come on in and grab a seat
It sure feels good to be
With people like me
