Nicotine turns your lungs black
A steak will make you have a heart attack
Hard liquors hard on the liver it will put you in the ground
Gotta watch out for those UV rays
A good bar fight will get you shot these days
They'll pull a gun better bite your tongue if you plan on stickin' round

There's a mile long list of things that'll get you killed
If one don't get you the other one will

So I'm gonna smoke that cigar when there's cause to celebrate
I'm gonna drink what I wanna drink
Eat something I can taste
Gonna live it up til they lay me down and throw dirt on my grave
Cause somethings gonna kill me
Somethings gonna kill me someday anyway

Granddad lived til he was ninety-five
Took a nip and a pinch everyday of his life
He'd smoke a pack and break his back out in that red hot sun
Got a buddy who did the low fat deal six miles a day on his treadmill
He fell flat on his back at the age of forty-one
The good Lords the only one who's runnin' the show
Oh were all gonna go when were gonna go
