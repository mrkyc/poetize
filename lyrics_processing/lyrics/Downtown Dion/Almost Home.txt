I'm almost home and she's on the block right now
You know I want to but I'm on the clock right now
Roll something in the back
Same color as the act, can't stop right now
And I'm coming home and she looks fine with nothing on
You love that song let it go
My baby's always coming home to me
My baby's always coming home to me

Don't know love but this is what it seems to be
Can't explain it but you dont know what you mean to me
Thinking bout you while these other bitches feen for me
Thinking bout you every time I had a feen for green
Wish we could bag up these dimes together
Fuck in the booth if it rhymes together
I run downtown in the spawns forever
Me and my block need more time together
You know I want to be with you in the first place
But I gotta put in overtime about the work place
If he's thirst is the first and its Thursday
Wishing I was with you in the worse way
But I'm on my way back
I'm in an Audi but I treat it like a Maybach
One o'clock but my watch never says that
On two bars fall asleep if I lay back
You might also like
I'm almost home and she's on the block right now
You know I want to but I'm on the clock right now
Roll something in the back
Same color as the act, can't stop right now
And I'm coming home and she looks fine with nothing on
You love that song let it go
My baby's always coming home to me
My baby's always coming home to me

Selling dope but I'm thinking 'bout you
Just a couple more months then we move
Somebody just called me for what I got left
So I'ma be home in a few
Jump in that whip and I'm speeding home fast girl
Better throw on some shit got some shit for that ass girl
She hate that I trap but she love when I rap about it
Need some paper you don't need to ask about it
Find a nigga who realer I really doubt it
Tryin' to show you way more than I talk about it
Victoria's secret I beat on that pussy girl
Ain't no more secrets
Fuck a hotel I use airbnb for the weekend
Plus we can smoke on that reefer
Yeah
I'm almost home and she's on the block right now
You know I want to but I'm on the clock right now
Roll something in the back
Same color as the act, can't stop right now
And I'm coming home and she looks fine with nothing on
You love that song let it go
My baby's always coming home to me
