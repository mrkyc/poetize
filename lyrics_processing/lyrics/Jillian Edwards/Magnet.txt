I wanna be right, right here in the middle of Your story
I wanna run like a river to the places You call me
Close enough to feel the stillness when You speak
Nothing between us, just You and me

So let me be a magnet to everywhere You move
Lead me to the center of everything You do
And when I start to wonder away from what is true
Pull me back, pull me back, pull me back
Pull me back to You
(Pull me back to You, pull me back to You, pull me back to You)
Pull me back to You
(Pull me back to You, pull me back to You, pull me back to You)

I wanna stay right, right here in the safety of Your shadow
I wanna dance in the dark 'cause I know You hold me close
Oh, Your presence is the only thing I need
No independence, with You, I'm free

So let me be a magnet to everywhere You move
Lead me to the center of everything You do
And when I start to wonder away from what is true
Pull me back, pull me back, pull me back
Pull me back to You
(Pull me back to You, pull me back to You, pull me back to You)
Pull me back to You
(Pull me back to You, pull me back to You, pull me back to You)

I'm drawn to You forever

Let me be a magnet to everywhere You move
Lead me to the center of everything You do

Pull me back, pull me back
Let me be a magnet to everywhere You move
Lead me to the center of everything You do
And when I start to wonder away from what is true
Pull me back, pull me back, pull me back
Pull me back to You
