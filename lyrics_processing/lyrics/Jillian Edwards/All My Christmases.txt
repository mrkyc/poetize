Sleigh bells ring
Church bells too
Three days after Christmas
I met you
I wore a big white dress
You wore a fancy suit
The easiest thing
That I'll ever do
We knew it from the start
It was simple, it was true
The snow fell from the sky
I fell in love with you
At least a thousand times
You might also like
And now
Every Christmas from now on
I'll be here by your side
And now
Every day in between
And for all of our lives
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
And any kiss from you, you know
I do, I do, I do
From now on
All my Christmases with you
Ooh Ooh Oooh
Ooh Ooh Oooh
Ooh Ooh Oo-ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh

Rocking 'round the Christmas tree
Rocking 'round the world
As long as you're with me
I'll sing my songs
You keep the beat
Every Christmas, honey
Where I wanna be
And for the rest of our time
And now
Every Christmas from now on
I'll be here by your side
And now
Every day in between
And for all of our lives
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
And any kiss from you, you know
I do, I do, I do
From now on
All my Christmases with you

There will be days that we'll be cold
There will be times when we won't know
What life will throw, but
I'll be beside you

Every Christmas from now on
I'll be here by your side
And now
Every day in between
And for all of our lives
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
And any kiss from you, you know
I do, I do, I do
From now on
All my Christmases
From now on
Every New Years kiss
From now on
All my Christmases with you
Ooh Ooh Oooh
Ooh Ooh Oooh
Ooh Ooh Oo-ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh

Every day is Christmas (Ooh Ooh Oooh)
Every day I'm living by your side (Ooh Ooh Oooh)
Ooh Ooh Oo-ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Oooh
Ooh Ooh Oooh
All my Christmases darling (Ooh Ooh Oo-ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh)
