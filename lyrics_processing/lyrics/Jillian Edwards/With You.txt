Like dimes in my pocket
I'll take you with you sunrise
I'll take you any old time
I need you like evening
Like the bill I owed last week
Like the sound of the city
Like sleep like time
There's no use for me now
I've figured it out
I'm a sailor ashore with no boat to sail out
Onto the world to see all the pearls and planets and things
The ocean doesn't sing without you
But oh how it does how it does
With you the edge of a mountain
That free falling feelin'
That hurt with the healin'
The way my name sounds coming from
Your lips is the best thing
I ever been called
I'm quietly enthralled the way you
Move me it's paralyzingly
There's no use for me now
I've figured it out
I'm a sailor ashore with no boat to sail out
Onto the world to see all the pearls and planets and things
What does anything mean without you
But oh what it does what it does
And then somebody knows
Somebody holds
Somebody wraps me up and folds me out
You try out all these things
Out from the deep I've never seen
Not sure of anything other then the way
You break me build me pour me out and fill me up
Because without you without you
I'll slide and I'll tune
There's too much space in every room
Without you no reason to dine when it's just plastic wine
Without you now I've been to the tale of time
Words hardly have use
But oh how they do how they do
There's no use for me now
I've figured it out
I'm a sailor ashore with no boat to sail out
Onto the world to see all the pearls and planets and things
What does anything mean without you
But oh what it does what it does
