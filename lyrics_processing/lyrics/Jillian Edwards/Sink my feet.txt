Down in security
Unmoved by changing tides
And shadows' shifting lines
I'm tired of getting worn
Let me wake with the morn
Once again be reborn
And think about eternity a little more
Then I'd see the stars
See the sun
And I'd see all that has been done
And I'd
I'd leave my fear alone
I'd leave my fear alone
Not asking for anything
Just keep me by you
And sink my feet in the stone
Sink my feet in your stone
Not asking for anything
Just keep me by you
Keep me by you
'Cause I wander, I get caught
I lift and I drift off
My forgetful mind runs all the time
To places I don't care to find
Cause I wander like the wind
Here today gone tomorrow
And back again
I'm blinded through and through
'Til I'm touched by you
Then I
You might also likeI leave my fear alone
I leave my fear alone
Not asking for anything
Just keep me by you
And sink my feet in the stone
Sink my feet in your stone
Not asking for anything
Just keep me by you
Keep me by you
If you are the sea, go on, send me deep
If you are the wind, set my sail free
If you are the rocks, set my feet upon you
Never let me move
Keep me by you
Keep me by you
I wanna sink my feet
Down in security
Unmoved by changing tides
And shadows' shifting lines
Then I'd see the stars
See the sun
And I'd see all that has been done
And I'd
I'd leave my fear alone
I'd leave my fear alone
Not asking for anything
Just keep me by you
And sink my feet in the stone
Sink my feet in the stone
Not asking for anything
Just keep me by you
