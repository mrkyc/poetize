Cause I don't have one yet
I've got almost and maybes
And what happened here baby
But not a love song
But we've got time to kill
All the reasons we should hold back
And I wear you on a
Locket 'round my neck
And I haven't opened it up yet
But I'll look back and laugh I'll bet
And tell you 'bout these days
Like they are stories of old
And I wish my voice would echo
Through galaxies and such
To scratch the surface of
Explaining to you just how much I'm glad
You don't have to try
You don't have to change
Baby you stay just the same
Used to want time to run so quickly
Now crawling is fine
Cause the older I get the more
I see I need every moment
To let my roots grow down deep

All the reasons we should hold back
And I wear you on a
Locket 'round my neck
And I haven't opened it up yet
But I'll look back and laugh I'll bet
And tell you 'bout these days
Like they are stories of old
And I wish my voice would echo
Through galaxies and such
To scratch the surface of
Explaining to you just how much I'm glad
You don't have to try
You don't have to change
Baby you stay just the same
I'll try not to wish you would hurry
I'm learning how not to worry
I don't want to let you down
Could I sing to every week
Make just enough for what we need
And walk together 'round the town
I'll try not to wish you would hurry
I'm learning how not to worry
I don't want to let you down
Could I sing to every week
Make just enough for what we need
And walk together 'round the town
Wish my voice would echo
Through galaxies and such
To scratch the surface of
Explaining to you just how much I'm glad
You don't have to try
You don't have to change
