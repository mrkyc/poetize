Just the other day (ugh)
Bitch tried to try me had to put her in her place (ugh)
Bust it like a K (ugh)
When you see me coming better run the other way (ugh)
I ain't got too much to say (ugh)
Bust it wide open then I bust it in his face (ugh)
Been Bout my pay (ugh)
If it ain't about the money
I don't want to conversate
Kicking bitches out cuz it's time to renovate
I don't really fuck with y'all bitches anyway
Eat the fatty up like a Waffle House plate
She a ten in the body but a thotty in the face
Thotty in the face
A thotty in the face
If a bitch outline ima knock her in shape
Bandz on deck I'll go shopping anyway
If I ain't got it in the bank
Then I got it In the safe Bitch!
