I see the hole in the heart that you try
To fill with a drink
I see the light at the end of the dark
It might make you think
About where you've been, babe
And what you've done
Yeah, I know you hate this town
You're not the only one

I know you're hurting
And you're feeling sold
I know it hurts when
You don't know where to go
And when you're tied up
By the past you hold
You've got to know
That you are good as gold

I see the crack in your ribs when you fell
Over your heels
I see you hurt by the words when he said
Love it ain't real
But let me hold you
And tell you what I see
You are the light of the day
You mean so much to me
You might also like
I know you're hurting
And you're feeling sold
I know it hurts when
You don't know where to go
And when you're tied up
By the past you hold
You've got to know
That you are good as gold
Oh, good as gold
Oh, good as gold
Oh, good as gold
You've got to know
That you are good as gold

Shoulder to shoulder
Yeah babe, I'm on for the ride
We can run far away
Stay in the heat of July
Oh, tonight
Push your troubles aside
We'll be alright, babe
(Good as gold)
Yeah
You are good as gold
Hey
I know you're hurting
And you're feeling sold
I know it hurts when
You don't know where to go
And when you're tied up
By the past you hold
You've got to know
That you are good as gold
Oh, yeah you are good as gold
(Yeah, you are)
Oh, good as gold
(You've got to got to know babe)
Oh, good as gold
You've got to know
