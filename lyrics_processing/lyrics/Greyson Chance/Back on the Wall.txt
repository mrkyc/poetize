I'm wild somedays but I'm loyal, baby
I know you think I'm coming undone
But there's no need, no need to be afraid

Just let it go for a minute
If you're feeling cold, let it hit ya
We want to feel emotion so let's feel it

Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall

You're intoxicating but you're so damn complicated
I want to see you coming undone
After all this time that I've been waiting

So just let it go for a minute
If you're feeling cold, let it hit ya
We want to feel emotion so let's feel it
You might also like
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall

So just let it go for a minute
If you're feeling cold, let it hit ya
We want to feel emotion so let's feel it
Puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall

When darkness comes to you babe
You don't have to worry
I'mma be the one to stay, I'mma be the one to stay
When darkness comes to you babe
You don't have to worry
I'mma be the one to stay
I'mma be the one to stay
When darkness comes to you babe
You don't have to worry
I'mma be the one to stay
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall

So just let it go for a minute
If you're feeling cold, let it hit ya
We want to feel emotion so let's feel it
Puts me back on the wall
