I'm holding onto every word that you last said to me
Hear your emotion and how everything to you was uneasy, oh

All these hours between us, they mean nothing
I'll be back to you one day, one day
And all these miles between us, they mean nothing
Oh, I promise we're okay, we're okay now

2 AM calls, oh, it's my nature
I'm a little bit high, calling to tell you
I'm yours, I'm yours
Remember that night out in my car
When I told you there wouldn't be no scars?
Still yours, still yours

No matter who I'm with, it's you that I adore
If you're not sure, baby, I'm yours
Given the way you make me feel, I want you more
If you're not sure, baby, I'm yours

I'm hoping that you'll hear me when I say I need you around
'Cause life's so busy, babe
You keep me up, I'm never coming down, oh yeah, hey
You might also like
And all these towns between us, they mean nothing
I'll be back to you one day, one day
And all these roads between us, they mean nothing
Oh, I promise we're okay, we're okay

2 AM calls, oh, it's my nature
I'm a little bit high, calling to tell you
I'm yours, I'm yours
Remember that night out in my car
When I told you there wouldn't be no scars?
Still yours, still yours

No matter who I'm with, it's you that I adore
If you're not sure, baby, I'm yours
Given the way you make me feel, I want you more
If you're not sure, baby, I'm yours

I know it's how you're feeling
I'm here, I'm never leaving
I'm yours, I'm yours
I know it's how you're feeling
I'm here, I'm never leaving
I'm yours, I'm yours (Oh, I'm yours)
No matter who I'm with, it's you that I adore
If you're not sure, baby, I'm yours
Given the way you make me feel, I want you more
If you're not sure, baby, I'm yours

2 AM calls, oh, it's my nature
I'm a little bit high, calling to tell you
I'm yours, I'm yours
Remember that night out in my car
When I told you there wouldn't be no scars?
