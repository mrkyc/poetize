You found me in the dark, baby
You found me in the dark, baby
Said you like them real crazy
Said you like them real crazy

You were looking for nirvana
You were looking for nirvana
Said you wanted no drama
Said you wanted no drama

Prayed all the prayers that I could pray
Not even God could give me this feeling
Never going back I'm gonna stay
Gonna stay with you until the morning
Every morning, every morning

You ain't got the right, baby coming 'round here
But you came around, came around here
Never saw the world so fucking clear
Until you came around, came around here
No, we ain't got a right to have a love this good
But they'd have it, honey, if they could
Bless their minds without the tears
Open their eyes and have no fear
You might also like
Found me in the bar, baby
Found me in the bar, baby
Drinking 'til I was hazy
Drinking 'til I was hazy

Now you're lying in the bed on me
See you lying in the bed on me
I'ma give you no drama
I'ma give you no drama

I answered all the prayers that you could pray
Not even God could give you this feeling
Pull you in when you go astray
And I will ride with you until the evening
Every evening, every evening

You ain't got the right, baby coming 'round here
But you came around, came around here
Never saw the world so fucking clear
Until you came around, came around here
No, we ain't got a right to have a love this good
But they'd have it, honey, if they could
Bless their minds without the tears
Open their eyes and have no fear
I will be honest
All of this got me blind
My past forgotten
But I don't even mind

I will be honest
All of this got me blind
My past forgotten
And I don't even mind
No, I don't even mind

You ain't got the right, baby coming 'round here
But you came around, came around here
Never saw the world so fucking clear
Until you came around, came around here
No, we ain't got a right to have a love this good
But they'd have it, honey, if they could
Bless their minds without the tears
