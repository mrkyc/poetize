White roses on a pastel sky
Broken vows on our lips run dry
I see you out with your friends, you smile
It's funny how that goes, I haven't slept in a while
I never saw it coming
I thought we had it all
I feel you in those moments
Those nights, held in your arms

Darling, be careful with me
'Cause there's part of me that you don't know
Darling, be gentle with me
When you tell me that you need to go
And if you should miss me, don't call me
Don't tell me, just leave me alone
Because you cut me wide open
Left teardrops on all my white roses
'Cause you cut me wide open
Left teardrops on all my white roses

Same places on a Friday night
Holding glances, but we're tongue tied
I'm with my friends, and it's hard to smile
It's crazy how that feels, I haven't slept in a while
You might also like
I never saw it coming
I thought we had it all
I feel you in those moments
Those nights, held in your arms

Darling, be careful with me
'Cause there's part of me that you don't know
Darling, be gentle with me
When you tell me that you need to go
And if you should miss me, don't call me
Don't tell me, just leave me alone
Because you cut me wide open
Left teardrops on all my white roses
'Cause you cut me wide open
Left teardrops on all my white roses

I want to believe that maybe it's just emotion
But I cannot see my life without you, those moments
So wild and free, blinded by love, devoted
But now it's just me, unspoken words, white roses

Darling, be careful with me
'Cause there's part of me that you don't know
Darling, be gentle with me
When you tell me that you need to go
And if you should miss me, don't call me
Don't tell me, just leave me alone
Because you cut me wide open
