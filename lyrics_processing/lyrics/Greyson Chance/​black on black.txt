I think I've seen you before
On a poster that I hung on my door
I always wanted just to see a little more
Now you're lying next to me on my floor, hmm

I'm on some '90s shit, lime and a vodka kick
Just like I'm cool enough for you

I love the way you wear that black on black
Oh, I love the way you talk to me like that
With your fingers on my chest, it's heart attack
Oh, I love the way you wear that black on black
Take it off like that

Let's stay here for a while
You'll snap some Polaroids 'cause, boy, that's your style
You'll tell me that you want to see a little more
We end up back down on the floor, hey

I'm on some '90s shit, lime and a vodka kick
Just like I'm cool enough for you
(Feel like I'm cool enough for you)

I love the way you wear that black on black
Oh, I love the way you talk to me like that (No, yeah)
With your fingers on my chest, it's heart attack (It's heart attack)
Oh, I love the way you wear that black on black
Take it off like that
Like that
Take it off like that

California kid, you're a nasty punk
Smoking them cigs, smoking all them blunts
M6 riding and you got that cash
Rock that black on black on black
California kid, you're a fucking sleeze
But damn, boy, you got me fucking on my knees
M6 riding, making out in the back
Rock that black on black on black

I love the way you wear that black on black (Oh)
Oh, I love the way you talk to me like that (Oh, talk to me like that)
With your fingers on my chest, it's heart attack (It's heart attack)
Oh, I love the way you wear that black on black (Oh)

California kid, you're a nasty punk
Smoking them cigs, smoking all them blunts
M6 riding and you got that cash
Rock that black on black on black
California kid, you're a fucking sleeze
But damn, boy, you got me fucking on my knees
M6 riding, making out in the back
Rock that black on black on black
Hey, rock that black on black on black
