These nights are a little bit colder
Now that you're gone
My skies seem a little bit darker
Sweet dreams come a little bit harder...
I hate when you're gone
Everyday time is passing
Growing tired of all this travelling
Take me away to where you are
I wanna be holding your hand
In the sand
By the the tire swing
Where we use to be
Baby you and me
I travel a thousand miles
Just so I can see you smile
Feels so far away when you cry
Cause home is in your eyes
Your heart beats a little bit faster
There's tears where there use to be laughter...
Now that I'm gone...
You talk just a little bit softer
Things take a little bit longer
You hate that I'm gone
You might also likeEveryday time is passing
Growing tired of all this travelling
Take me away to where you are
I wanna be holding your hand
In the sand
By the the tire swing
Where we use to be
Baby you and me
I travel a thousand miles
Just so I can see you smile
Feels so far away when you cry
Cause home is in your eyes
If I could write another ending
This wouldn't even be our song
I'd find a way where we would never ever be apart
Right from the start
I wanna be holding your hand
In the sand
By the the tire swing
Where we use to be
Baby you and me
I travel a thousand miles
Just so I can see you smile
Feels so far away when you cry
Cause home is in your eyes
I wanna be holding your hand
In the sand
By the the tire swing
Where we use to be
Baby you and me
I travel a thousand miles
Just so I can see you smile
Feels so far away when you cry
