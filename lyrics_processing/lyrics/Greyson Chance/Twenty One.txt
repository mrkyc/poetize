Yo, you'll hold the bowl?
Yeah

I feel electric when we hit the highway
Go to the city, spend some money and play
I got somebody and I want them calling my name
(Yo, Greyson!)
Life is so hectic and I need to relax
My friends, they tell me that I need to cut back
But I live in the moment, burnt sleeves and cigarette ash
(No, it's not a fake, I swear)

Cruising all summer, cheap drinks, fast toys
Take another fall for a pretty boy
He puts a spell on me, puts a spell on me
Fucks me all up, puts a hex on me
Dancing all night, ripped jeans, red eyes
Take another hit, trying to be a cool guy
It fits well on me, you fit well on me
Fuck me all up, put your hands on me

One more bottle, have some fun
We only got one year to be twenty one, twenty one, twenty one
One more baby, have some fun
We only got one year to be twenty one, twenty one, twenty one
You might also like
I'm feeling perfect when the music's too loud
I'm sick of working, I just wanna hang out
I want somebody, I want a stranger in the crowd
(He just had no game and his friends were super dumb)
Life is so crazy and I think I am too
I easily forget 'bout people, it's true
'Cause I live in the moment
New faces, vintage tattoos
(Greyson, what the fuck am I doing right now?)

So baby let's get one more bottle, have some fun
We only got one year to be twenty one, twenty one, twenty one
One more baby, have some fun
