I can see the sky for miles, I can see that time so clear
When you told me "forever" was a word that I should not fear
I can see you driving and smoking, Virginia Slims on the dash
On that day I was crying, you stopped the car, looked back
You said

"Boy, get the message, this ain't no New York City
Born and bred in West Texas, raised you to be different
No matter how it ends, no matter all your sin
I hope you will understand
When I leave, you better be a good man"

I can see that house in the summer, baseball in the yard
And when my knees got bloody, you told me keep playing hard
I remember mass on Sundays, collared up to the ten
You were so damn faithful, even if it all was a mess
And in those years that we weren't speaking
When I was drinking for some meaning
You called me on the phone and then you said, hey

"Boy, get the message, this ain't no New York City
Born and bred in West Texas, raised you to be different
No matter how it ends, no matter all your sin
I hope you will understand
When I leave, you better be a good man"
You might also like
"You better be a good man"

And it's so hard to imagine what I'll do without you here
As you gaze your eyes towards mine, tell me to wipe away those tears
You say Jesus loves you, always will, no matter what you did
And in that moment, I'm a kid again
You said

"Boy, get the message, this ain't no New York City
Born and bred in West Texas, raised you to be different
No matter how it ends, no matter all your sin
I hope you will understand
When I leave, you better be a good man"
