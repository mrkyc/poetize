Flying through the nighttime, and I'm feeling awfully sad
Missing all your punchlines, yeah they make me feel so glad
Now Joe came around, feet off the ground
Thinks he loves you, loves you when you get down
Oh, my time is running out
And yes my fists ready for a shootout
I'll beat his ass, turn that grin into a frown
Me and you we're never coming down

You got nothing wrong with you, killa
Thrilla in Manila
The lipstick stains on your boxing gloves
You got what I love, you got what I love
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila

State of mind is endless, yeah I'm fighting for my right
Baby you my lifeline, I need you every night
Now the gloves are off, where is the king
Laying on the floor surely that ain't he
Oh, adrenalin is ecstasy
Blood on his cheeks, it's a revelation
I beat his ass, where's his reputation
I don't even care now it's you and me, oh
You might also like
You got nothing wrong with you, killa
Thrilla in Manila
The lipstick stains on your boxing gloves
You got what I love, you got what I love
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila

I'll take a hit for you
I'll take a shot for you
I'll take a fall for you
Anything you want me to
I'll take a hit for you
I'll take a shot for you
I'll take a fall for you
Anything you want me to

I love it when you sitting close, in all your expensive clothes
Looking through your shades, can you see all the scars we made?
Heal me in all of your spirit waters, I can even swim to the bottom
If you want, I'll drown today cause baby I'll be dying eventually
You got nothing wrong with you, killa
Thrilla in Manila
The lipstick stains on your boxing gloves
You got what I love, you got what I love
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Whatcha gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila

I love it when you sitting close, in all your expensive clothes
I love it when you sitting close, in all your expensive clothes
You smoke au naturale
Baby sitting here composed as hell
I may be Americano, but you be hitting me like Pacifican bongos
