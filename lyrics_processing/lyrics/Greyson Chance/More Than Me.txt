I lost my way on streets that I paved
When I was deep in the blue
You were gone the whole time
You fall behind and I say goodbye
When you dropped a drink, I numbed my mind

Gone are the times we sipped on good wine
For the taste, yeah
Now you and I, we just drink what we find
Getting wasted

Your memory near, laced with the pain
I needed love but it's never the same
For I wanted more, you wanted more than me
When the bottle is gone, in that silence I'll find
That life isn't nothing but chasin' the time
For I wanted more, you wanted more than me

Oh baby, since you lied I've had restless nights
Heard you got a brand new me
Guess you doin' fine
You might also like
While you're getting through
All the things that you do, staying vacant
I'll drink what I find
Cause my angels on high, staying wasted

Your memory near, laced with the pain
I needed love but it's never the same
For I wanted more, you wanted more than me
When the bottle is gone, in that darkness I'll find
That life isn't nothing but chasin' the time
For I wanted more, you wanted more than me

The smoke got clear, when the days turned months
And the months turned years, for the anger to fade
When I took a step back the realization came
You weren't looking at me, you were looking instead
Somewhere over my head

The smoke got clear, when the days turned months
And the months turned years, for the anger to fade
When I took a step back the realization came
You weren't looking at me, you were looking instead
Somewhere over my head
The smoke got clear, when the days turned months
And the months turned years, for the anger to fade
When I took a step back the realization came
You weren't looking at me, you were looking instead
Somewhere over my head

The smoke got clear, when the days turned months
And the months turned years, for the anger to fade
When I took a step back the realization came
You weren't looking at me, you were looking instead
Somewhere over my head, somewhere over my head
