Don't tell me you love me when I don't
Keep those words locked in a bottle
I am too young for that lifestyle
I'm Mr. Casual
Our difference showed in our poisons
I live for long nights on the weekends
You knew the path when you walked in
Why can't you forget it?

And don't call me something I'm not
I am my father's son
Yeah, I am a hit and run
And don't call me something I'm not
I am my father's son
Yeah, I am a hit and run

Now I'm all alone
And I ain't got no one to call home baby
Is this what I want?
An empty bed with my shit so crazy
Oh, oh, hit and run, baby
Now I'm all alone
And I ain't got no one to call home baby
Is this what I want?
An empty bed with my shit so crazy
Oh, oh, hit and run, baby
You might also like
I'm glad that you know where you're going
That life is so easily stomached
But I do not live in the fashion
Continuously find a new passion
I do what I do in the nighttime
I'm sorry, but babe, it's my bloodline
You knew what I was when we did this
Why can't you forget it?

And don't call me something I'm not
I am my father's son
Yeah, I am a hit and run
And don't call me something I'm not
I am my father's son
Yeah, I am a hit and run

Now I'm all alone
And I ain't got no one to call home baby
Is this what I want?
An empty bed with my shit so crazy
Oh, oh, hit and run, baby
Now I'm all alone
And I ain't got no one to call home baby
Is this what I want?
An empty bed with my shit so crazy
Oh, oh, hit and run, baby
Don't call home, don't call home
I am a hit and run
Don't call home, don't call home

Now I'm all alone
And I ain't got no one to call home baby
Is this what I want?
An empty bed with my shit so crazy
Oh, oh, hit and run, baby
Now I'm all alone
And I ain't got no one to call home baby
Is this what I want?
An empty bed with my shit so crazy
