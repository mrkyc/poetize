I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
I didn't know that I could get this low

And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know

I see a dark reflection in my dashboard
Don't even know where I'm driving to anymore
I think about us back together someday
What you doing this Sunday
I needed space so I left home
But now I'm desperate for the things I know
Like how you made me laugh on a bad day
Where are you now, I need you babe

And I don't know where to go, yeah
You might also like
Cause I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
I didn't know that I could get this low

And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know

Remember older days when we were so young
Riding top down in a city that I used to love
I hear those words you said when you were shit faced
Told me to stop playing all those games
But I wasn't then, and I'm not now
Didn't know how to feel when you broke me down
I needed time to move around without you
But I think I'm ready to hear I love you

And I don't know where to go, yeah
Cause I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
I didn't know that I could get this low

And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know
And I, and I don't know where to go
