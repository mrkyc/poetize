Ahh shit!
Yeh
Everywhere I go
Nuff gunshot are firin out the ghetto area seen?
I haffa watch my back
Too much crack seen?
Watch yourself cuz nuff home-icide a gwan in de area

I hear some niggas clockin major on the other side of town
Slippin' slidin for a proper come up to come around
Called up the homies from way back, who dream of gettin paid
Then finally get paid with the amount of 80 G's
6:30 lay in cut, prepare to get ready
Me and Ty and Kurupt, mashin to get our fetti
Food stamps galore, kick in the door get on the floor
Make sure my homies get away smooth with the dough
A hardcore motherfucker raised up not knowin
Now my dream is just a dream we're sellin dope and hoein
Moms can't tell me shit, I make the rules that I live by
In and out the house, late at night, and plus I got high
The homies influenced me to be the G of all G's
Perfectedly innovated to all my homies
Pull out the Riviera, plus I kick up dust
Pull out the brain, pull out the thang, cock back and bust
It's just some gangsta shit, goin down on the Eastside
Some niggas who died and tried to hooride on mine
Pull on the 7 Carter with the homey Flossy Floss
He's the homey from the Beach who's known for takin off
Pile up the bird then swerve, conversate on smokin some herb
Finger on the trigger, cons-templatin on a murder
I mean, takin life for life, cause it's right
Shit, niggas gotta do, to earn they stripes, straight merkin

Word on the street is that them DPG niggas shot they homeboy
Now the only sound in the town is gunfire
Going down I sport the crown I give it up on motherfuckers
When I roll through I thought you knew about them Doggs in blue
Now forty-five, niggas rollin' by the spot
I'm on alert I'm down to work every nigga that I shot
Niggas skeet out quick, around the block who know we comin back
Post up early on the attack
Slowly but surely spot an enemy slippin out his domain
Rode up on him and let him see the twelve gauge
The homey Ty banged him on GP because we stuffed him then we bagged him
Cause he violated the rule of the streets
Two redrums under my belt, and felt good bout the murder
Haven't you ever heard of a murderer motherfucker?
Cause I'm, a straight gangsta, doin what I feel
Niggas no need to tempt, for me to kill, straight blastin
The enemy, can't see those who try to get with me
Understand where I'm comin from the D-P to the G-the-C
The niggas who trip, niggas that dipped
Niggas that conversate with the Bloods or Crips
It's just a West coast thang, gangsta thang
Niggas come around here but surely can't hang because-a
We don't hang with no bustas and sho' nuff
Don't hang with no fags and niggas down to blast, straight merkin
It's some gangsta shit, that's going down
Homicide, straight murder/homicide
It's some gangsta shit, here in this town

Check it out

I heard niggas kickin static makin noise
Cold hearted wanna get it started with my boys
Automatic toys to tangle with licks for profit
Got shit on lockdown cause I lets the Glock spit
Soon as D-A-Z hits me on my hip, talk about chips
To get run heatin them clips, the gauge kicks
Automatic tech nine spits, I gotta
Roll with the Pound that's the neighborhood armada
Am I the only motherfucker ridin?
Am I the only rider but I found a whole pound of niggas violent
I got the big homey Ty money worldwide
From Portland, Oregon L.A. to the N.Y
I'm bout to crash in your door, unload the double four
Then stash it, then we blasted all we saw
The fo'-fo', the fo' double sparkin
The gang marking up your hood like nuttin but trouble

That's right
We dat live by de knife will die by de knife
You betta try save your life
On your life dere might be a oversight
Take my ad-vice and jump inna your ride
Don't ar-gue with de Death Row pride
