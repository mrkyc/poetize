Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)
Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)

Sorry bitch, sorry bitch
We the crack niggas that you should be fuckin' with
I'm mistaking you girlies and who you lookin' for
And not a trick, a thug bitch and gucci hoe
Oh you really know, girl you really know
It's you booty though, it's my duty though
One thing that a nigga can't stand though
Ain't your boyfriend, a nigga or your man though
I'm just too dossed for the pussy and the money
You could get more with me than you ever could from me
When it comes to mine you get nadadada
She do it for the dollar , sometimes I make you holla

Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)

You really wanna shine with a nigga, high sign with a  nigga
Snapchat or either facetime with a nigga
Think back called that
Thought that I was in love with you what makes you dont think ?
No roses no wine, four hoes on my side
Bitch I show you no signs
Blind to the fact that I'm a motherfucking pimp and I belong to the Mac Park
Ain't no need to lie, shit we pimp or die
They call me knocking-noop I'm from anoher whole tribe
No worries, I'm in a hurry
Let me say it to you like this punk bitch: I'm sorry

Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)
Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)
Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)
Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)

Yo, all I wanna do is the make the whole crowd bounce ya (bounce ya!)
Bitch and your punky-ass friend bouncin' on my balls
Crenshaw to Martin Luther King and Beach
Where we chained to the speech, to English
Look bitch, shut the fuck up and cook bitch
A nigga hungry, punk bitch, bunk bitch
What the fuck you want bitch, besides dick
You ain't gettin' no cake ain't nothin' new
Besides hoe-cake hoes gotta eat too
Shut the fuck up bitch, eat a dick bitch
Eat the dick bitch, now listen
I'm sorry if it just didn't work
You fuck too with the homies and I was first
But I damn sure ain't the last
Just don't get no one's jack stuck in your ass
I'm sorry bitch!
Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)
Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)
Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)
Sorry bitch, sorry, sorry bitch (I can't be your lover)
