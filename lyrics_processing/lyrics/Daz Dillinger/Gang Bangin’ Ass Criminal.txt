 Man I'm trying to have
Man I ain't trying to go for shit
 Man you know my Glock is hot
(Eastside)
Verse One: 
I'm coming through your zone ignite shit
Dogg Pound Gangsta to flame the light shit
Cause I own all
I'm 20 feet tall
The biggest wall built fuck around and get killed
Get shook
For trying to sneak a peak in my book
Comatose overdose the thoughts when he look
The forbidden
The hidden zone that I'm hitting
Don't play with my intelligence nigga as the heat slittin'
My right front palm
So I only got two choices loc; either blast or bomb
Vietnam
I bring the pain rains no sleet or hail
Execution style as the shells from the heat fell
Down to the ground like the rest of the dummies
That's what the fuck you get for tryna' try to play with my money
It's nothing but the Dogg Pound Gangstas
Mashes, verbal disasters, .38 stashes
Verse Two: 
I arise in disguise and surprise that ass
What you thought you caught me short, I'mma ride and blast
With the cannon
We landing shit all up in your knots
When niggas drop, then they stop with the planning and plots
Got a stock on my gauge
With notches of braid
Marked niggas caught in, they try to win and get sprayed
Rip the gates
Go flip the page to chapter three
First rule, dead fools can't come after me
I master free
Styles of catastrophe
Ask for G
A nigga best to answer me
My rep Long as the Beach that I represent
Dead nigga with my stare not to step to this
Verse Three: 
Now oh yeah Tray Deee
I mean I seen the whole plot
Be on alert, they get shot
Anywhere under that nigga caught
So drop the microphone on my own
I shown to blown
Away faulty MC's with the smudge or a chrome
I take the fame
Down on my own lyrical name
When the seasons change
When the storms and hurricanes
Why strain?
Spittin' rhymes, the beats so precise
On stage I get nice
Skatin' on mics like ice
Twice in the day
I get drunk
Smother punks with a plastic bag
Sack in the truck
Because they rhymes is glam
My shit bump like the doctor
Coming through
Bouncin' with the droptop
Like gangstas chillin on the block
Nah, we ain't worry for shit
Got escape doors like Capone
When shit get thick for my clique
Forty-fives and nines
Three-eighties and automatics
Slithering, coming through for you
And your boys with some static
I got to have it lovin' thrill of the drama
Enthusing me to gets mine on with the slaughter
I ought to be known as Daz Dillinger
For the shit that I'm known for
A Dogg Pound criminal
Verse Four: 
Now if the spot's hot
I hit the switch make the top drop
Don't stop
It's Soopafly with the sho shot
Won't stop
I got ya whole shit took
Look and listen
I rendition the rhymes with precision
You can't faze me, amaze me
I blaze like a saddle
It's Dogg Pound Ganstas hovering like a shadow
I never met a motherfucker who can make it stick
I never met a motherfucker who can fade my clique
You serve, you'll make the twitch like a nerve
You'll try to step to my wild style superb
Adjectives and verbs
Action packed with the words
I'll make it stop
The jaws drop and observe
I serve the block with Kurupt, Daz, Style, and Tray Deee
We be coming with the shit
That be the bomb baby
And ain't a Dogg Pound Gangsta won't knock you to the floor
Either you stupid as fuck or just don't know
Verse Five: 
Now I know you, know you
Stupid as fuck
I bust like a sawed off pump
Double barrel on 'em
Black gambinos at casinos
Get De Niro on 'em
If I want 'em
I'm goin' get 'em
If I gotta shot a nine
Twice, that's what I rhyme like
My clip ain't empty
Don't try to test a rider
Tempt me, simply
Bust, hot lead inside ya
Find ya
Dead or fighting for your life
With your last few
Live with hot lead from gun blast
Outlaws, outcast
Low lifes outlast
Long Beach niggas blast
Yeah them Eastsidas ride
The most, the coast
The west, the best
Weed and bitches
Sippin', hittin' switches
Dippin' hittin' up in niggas
Itchy fingers on triggers
Itty, bitty niggas
Ready for war
We kick down your door
Draw heat and
Lay everybody down on the floor
Verse Six: 
It's the same thing, different places
With snakes, cowards and strong-arm robbery cases
Niggas faces
On paper chases
It was seen, it was written
It ain't forbidden
For homies to be splittin
Disagreeing on what was hittin
Knowing what occurs
The many obstacles, impressions to defeat from gettin' served
Growing up is rough
Your name hits the streets, it gets tough
You can get scuffed and stuffed
Then I guess you had enough
Overbearing primes is sequential
It ain't coincidental that I keeps it stored in my mental
My eyes is for seein', so I watch
Bodies and plots
Run the plots
Call the shots for your knots
Nigga grips
That's why I keeps my dip in progress
Cause bodies of weed tryin' to defeat the progress
I just ain't the one for the mischief ya hear
Young Josey sees
Who I got a mission to hit
And constantly flips scripts
Outta wall revolves fast talkin'
And quick draws
How the problems is solved
I want it all (I want it all)
But it's movin' too slow
I'm out to blow
I don't know which way to go
Was on the right path
I thought
When I do dirt and worry about getting caught
