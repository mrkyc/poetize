Running 'round in circles, don't need to know which way to go
Caught up in the motion with feelings I, I can't control

Tried to contain all this overflow
Watch me spill over and float
A million pieces, a million pieces

Know I can't be trusted
To wear it on my sleeve
No, I can't be trusted
To say just what I mean
All I'm ever asking for you to rescue me
All I'm ever asking for you to rescue me
All I'm ever asking for you to rescue me
All I'm ever asking for you to rescue me
(All I'm ever asking for)

(All I'm ever asking for)
(All I'm ever asking for)
(All I'm ever asking for)
(All I'm ever asking for)
(All I'm ever asking for)
(All I'm ever asking for)
(All I'm ever asking for)
(All I'm ever asking for)

Caught up in the moment of what I want
Can't let go, 'til I got a motive
It's what you want, what you're waiting for

Tried to contain all this overflow
Watch me spill over and float
A million pieces, a million pieces

Know I can't be trusted
To wear it on my sleeve
No, I can't be trusted
To say just what I mean
All I'm ever asking for you to rescue me
All I'm ever asking for you to rescue me
All I'm ever asking for you to rescue me
All I'm ever asking for you to rescue me
