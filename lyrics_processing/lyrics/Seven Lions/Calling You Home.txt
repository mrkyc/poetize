Feel the waves over my head
I'm in too deep
I'm fading fast, but running right back
Oh, can't you see

That it's all my heart can take?
Broke from my mistakes
Scared that it's too late
So please

Don't say it's the end of the story
Don't say it's the end of the road
'Cause as long as you're there to hold me
I'll always be calling you home
Don't know what's waiting before me
But I don't have to go it alone
'Cause as long as you're there to hold me
I'll always be calling you home

In the dark, I'm losing my way
I need your light
I know it's hard, but baby, don't fade
It's worth the fight
