Get ready or not 'cause here I come
Dance, dance, dance, have some fun
Six, five, four, three, two, one
Get up, get up

Oh no, never ever gonna stop
Try and fly and if I drop, not gonna quit
Get up, get up, get up
Stand up, gonna make some noise
Sing until they hear my voice
Can't keep me down, get up, get up

Get ready or not 'cause here I come
Dance, dance, dance, have some fun
Six, five, four, three, two, one
Get up, get up

Get up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up

Rain falls down on my parade
Lemons into lemonade
Can't slow me down, no way, no way, no way
Yesterday is in the past
Dream on, tomorrow's coming fast
All you got is now, get up, get up
You might also like
Get ready or not 'cause here I come
Dance, dance, dance, have some fun
Six, five, four, three, two, one
Get up, get up

Get up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up

Hey you, don't let 'em see you frown
Come on, turn it upside down
Don't ever quit, get up, get up
When life puts you to the test
There's nothin' better than your best
Show 'em what you got, you got a lot
Show 'em what you got, get up, get up

Get up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, higher, higher
Up, up, up, hearts on fire
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up

Get ready or not 'cause here I come
Dance, dance, dance, have some fun
Six, five, four, three, two, one
Get up, get up

Get up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
Up, up, up, oh-woah
