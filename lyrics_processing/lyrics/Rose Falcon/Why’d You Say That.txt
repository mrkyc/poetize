Did I ask for this
I didn't ask for anything
If I did
I don't remember
Stop messing with my head
This is my heart
It's not a game
It's really not fair if you're playing

Why'd you say that?
Why'd you have to tell me?
Why'd you have to tell me?
Why'd you have to tell me that you loved me?
Why'd you say that?

Somebody might get hurt
Broken promise
Jagged edge
Somehow, I feel like I'm in danger
I'm trying not to fall
I'm dangling by your every word
So, if you're not gonna catch me
You might also like
Why'd you say that?
Why'd you have to tell me?
Why'd you have to tell me?

If you're gonna take it back
Go on
Paint the sunshine black
If you're gonna tear my world apart
Why'd you say I need you?
Why'd you say I love you?
Why'd you say always?
Why'd you say always?
Why'd you say, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh, oh

Why'd you say that?
Why'd you have to tell me?
Why'd you have to tell me?
Why'd you have to tell me that you loved me?
Why'd you say that?
Why'd you have to tell me?
Why'd you have to tell me?
Why'd you have to tell me that you loved me?
Tell me that you loved me
Why'd you say that?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh)
Why'd you say that?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh)
Why'd you say that?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh)
Why'd you say that?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh)
Why'd you say that?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh)
Why'd you say that?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh)
Why'd you say that?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh)
