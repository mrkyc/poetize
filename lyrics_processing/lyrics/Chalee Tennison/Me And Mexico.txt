Last week you told me our love was goin' south
So I tried to follow it I tried to track you down
Thought I caught wind of it outside of San Antone
But it was just a ghost so I kept right on goin'
I drove an told myself you wouldn't lie to me
Tears of confusion fell and I wiped them on my sleeve
Two tanks of gas and a floorboard full of coffee cups
I finally hit the border and Mexico was all there was
As I crossed that river the sun was settin'
But I started seein' the light
I walk those streets and I talked to myself
And I decided I would be all right
I drank some Tequila
I said,who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
I bought a big sombrero and made me laugh
Funny I don't think we were ever happy like that
Country full of strangers a thousand miles from home
The first time in a long time that I have felt alone

I couldn't understand the words but singing right out loud
Here is this border town that's where your memory lays
And when I head back home here's where it's gonna stay
As I cross that river the sun was settin'
But I started seein' the light
I walked those streets and I talked to myself
And I decided I would be all right
I drank some Tequila
I said,who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
I drank some Tequila
I said,who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go
(Me and Mexico)
