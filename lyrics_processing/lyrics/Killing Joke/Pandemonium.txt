She talks of supernatural aeons that we'll make
She says: Look behind the wave of changes
Feel the future taking shape

I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium

I ask her of her next of kin and loved ones in her care
She gestures all around her then she whispers: Everywhere
There is no nuclear family required anymore
My parents are the village and the village is the law

I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium

She said: Unlearn you must forget the values that you hold
Life is not longevity and beauty is the only goal

I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium

Cymbals that crash and pipes of pan awaken from your trance
There is no retribution here see how the heathen dance

I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
Hear the pandemonium
Extra lyrics -- singles only
The prisoner sat motionless, his cell was six by four
He walked to the horizon without walking through the door
We found ourselves converging as we walked towards the sun
Apart from all discussion, we were functioning as one
I can see tomorrow
I can see the world to come
I can see tomorrow
