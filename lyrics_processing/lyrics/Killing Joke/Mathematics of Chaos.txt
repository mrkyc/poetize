Suffering and pain crystallized in a brain that recreates the process again
Draws borders, cites laws monopolies of food and trade start wars
Every time we try to impose order we create chaos we create chaos - breakdown
I have doubts
A state of eternal conflict is all I have found
We build a wall that is made of tears
Watch the house fall down
And at the end of my life
Yes at the end of my life
All shall be well
All is as it was always meant to be...
Blessed are the meek it is written they shall inherit the earth
Watch her dying of cancer after a lifetime of caring for the poor
Child with her arms blown off screams as she bleeds upon the rocks
Sickened by my self-flagellation but I don't know how to stop
Where is your love, my loving god? - breakdown
I have my doubts
This base stand of filth and the people around
We build a wall that is made of tears
Watch the house fall down
And at the end of my life
Yes at the end of my life
All shall be well
All is as it was always meant to be...
You might also likeGlobalism and the UN neutralized by ethnic cleansing
Animal aggression and a mind to perceive this terminal conflict
Awareness is a curse - the more you open your eyes the more you despise
Fashioned in the creator's yolk
It must be some sort of practical joke
And in the corn, circles of chaos - breakdown
I have my doubts
A state of eternal conflict is all I have found
We build a wall that is made of tears
Watch the house fall down
And at the end of my life
Yes at the end of my life
All shall be well
All is as it was always meant to be...
