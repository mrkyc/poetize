What do I do, do I do, do I do now?
What do I do, do I do, do I do now?

I remember when you said "forever"
But we were just kids in love
You and I, we would try anything for the first time
And you know, boy, yeah, we just couldn't get enough

Was it something that I said that pushed you away?
Or was it something that I did that pointed the way to the door?
I'm calling, I'm calling
Was it something that I said that pushed you away?
Or was it something that I did that pointed the way to the door?
I'm calling, I'm calling

If I could change your mind
We could keep the fire burning
If I could turn back time
We could keep the whole world turning
If I could just stop crying
But you hit me from the blind side
What do I do now?
You might also like
I thought we had what dreams were made of
But my honey can't feed your hungry heart
All the leaves are changing colors
But you know, boy, this lonely girl's just falling apart

Was it something that I said that pushed you away?
Or was it something that I did that pointed the way to the door?
I'm calling, I'm calling

If I could change your mind
We could keep the fire burning
If I could turn back time
We could keep the whole world turning
If I could just stop crying
But you hit me from the blind side
What do I do now?

In the dark, I'm turning off my cellphone
I fall apart when our favorite show's on
It broke my heart and now you're gone
But I stand here hoping, eyes wide open
Cause I never ever saw this coming
If I could change your mind
We could keep the fire burning
If I could turn back time
We could keep the whole world turning
If I could just stop crying
But you hit me from the blind side
What do I do now?
