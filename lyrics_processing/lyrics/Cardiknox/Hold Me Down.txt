I keep on telling you
That I am not a sculptor, Im an architect
You don't even know me
On a course of collision, my walls are painted black
Open up your gates of gold, oh
Father left the family, daughter went different path
But I fear i've become just like dad

When I moved to New York, it was all supposed to work out
But the plan never goes how it should when it's mapped out
Even though I got issues still unfixed
I will tear down the tracks, like the Uptown 6
'Cause I can't help but feel like I know I deserve this

You will never hold me down
'Cause I'm already underground
Yeah, all i want is just to drown in lights and sound
I feel it in me
Just try and stop me now

I tried to tell you that I have to start over
Reset the etch-a-sketch, I'll rearrange my bedroom
Grab a stick, handkerchief, fill it with all my shit
Walk along the interstate
