I can't be without, I can't be without you
I can't be without, I can't be without you

They say I'm insane for feeling this way
But I'm not afraid 'cause your love gets me highest
They say I'll get hurt
That I'm not the first, this won't ever work
But I've never been more sure, 'cause your love gets me highest

Don't care what they say, we'll never change
They tell me to go, I want you to stay
People they hate, they keep throwing shade
But we still burn the brightest

So let 'em talk
I, I only fuck with you
Only you, only you
So brush it off
I, I only fuck with you
Only you, only you
So let 'em talk
Only you, only you
You might also like
Nothing to prove
Got nothing to lose, I'm betting on you
We're spending our love, our youth
But your love gets me highest

Don't care what they say, we'll never change
They tell me to go, I want you to stay
People they hate, they keep throwing shade
But we still burn the brightest

So let 'em talk
I, I only fuck with you
Only you, only you
So brush it off
I, I only fuck with you
Only you, only you
So let 'em talk
Only you, only you
So brush it off
I, I only fuck with you
Only you, only you

I can't be without, I can't be without you
I can't be without, I can't be without you
All I know is that I can't be without you
I only fuck with you
I can't be without, I can't be without you
I only fuck with you
So let 'em talk
I, I only fuck with you
Only you, only you
So brush it off
I, I only fuck with you (I only fuck with you)
Only you, only you
So let 'em talk

I can't be without, I can't be without you
I only fuck with you
I can't be without, I can't be without you
I only fuck with you
