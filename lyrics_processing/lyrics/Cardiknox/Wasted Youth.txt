Mama, I can't fill these shoes
Someday, I'll be thankful of my wasted youth

I've been runnin' for miles and miles
I'm a girl that just don't care
Head out to here and legs up to there
I've not eaten for a week
I'm skippin' breakfast and lunch 'cause I'm saying enough

Mama, I can't fill these shoes
Someday, I'll be thankful of my wasted youth
Whatever I do, I got so much to lose
Someday, I'll be thankful of my wasted youth
Mama, I can't fill these shoes
Someday, I'll be thankful of my wasted youth
Whatever I do, I got so much to lose
Someday, I'll be thankful of my wasted youth

There's another person  two inches away
Someone like me, but they're different
Yeah, they don't 
So fuck a DJ or a dance club, just turn up the bass
I'll talk in the phone my side
I'll 2 Step in place
I'll can get laid in this town
Without these pointy fuckin' shoes
My feet are black and blue, and so are you
