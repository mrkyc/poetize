I'm like a Russian Babushka doll
I just hide behind these copies
The one you see is just a painted fraud
The real me is hiding underneath 'em all
Ever since I was a little girl
I've been perfect on the surface
Now I cannot let them see me fall
The real me is hiding underneath it all

I hide, hide my face
Behind these Black Wayfarer shades
Fame's a shameful trade
Speakin' my mind is unbecoming
I feel fine when I feel nothing
I hide, hide my face
Behind these Black Wayfarer shades
Fame's a shameful trade
Speakin' my mind is unbecoming
I feel fine when I feel nothing

As I was sitting past in Joesy
How the sun rode on the dashboard
But when you spoke, everything went dark
Like a shattered jar of marbles, I fell apart
I paint my face and curl each eyelash
Yeah, like the rich kids, I've been privileged
To live a life where no one knows my lies
The real me is hiding underneath these eyes
You might also like
I hide, hide my face
Behind these Black Wayfarer shades
Fame's a shameful trade
Speakin' my mind is unbecoming
I feel fine when I feel nothing
I hide, hide my face
Behind these Black Wayfarer shades
Fame's a shameful trade
Speakin' my mind is unbecoming
I feel fine when I feel nothing

I got some issues, but God, I miss you now
September issue, but God, I miss you now
I got some issues, but God, I miss you now
September issue, but God, I miss you now
I got some issues, but God, I miss you now
September issue, but God, I miss you now
I got some issues, but God, I miss you now
September issue, but God, I miss you

I hide, hide my face
Behind these Black Wayfarer shades
Fame's a shameful trade
Speakin' my mind is unbecoming
I feel fine when I feel nothing
Fame's a shameful trade
Speakin' my mind is unbecoming
