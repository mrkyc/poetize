There were days where all I thought about
Was how you chewed me up and spit me out
When I felt your shifting shoulder blades
In the dark, I laid there wide awake

I'm thinking that
Baby, I remember everything that you forgot to say to me
Left me feeling blue
I'm thinking that
Maybe I was looking for a little something that could save me
But it wasn't you
So watch me go

I turn my phone to silent
I catch a train and ride it
Into the night, into the night, into the night I go
I'm flying like a nighthawk
I dance along the sidewalk
Into the night, into the night, into the night I go

My feet move forward through the black
Memories still try to pull me back
Two years of standing in the rain
Now I am free to break the chain
You might also like
I'm thinking that
Maybe I was looking for a little something that could save me
But it wasn't you
So watch me go

I turn my phone to silent
I catch a train and ride it
Into the night, into the night, into the night I go
I'm flying like a night hawk
I dance along the sidewalk
Into the night, into the night, into the night I go

I've never felt so alive
I'm running into the night
I've never felt so alive
I'm running into the night

Baby, I remember everything that you forgot to say to me
Left me feeling, left me feeling blue
I'm thinking that
Maybe I was looking for a little something that could save me
But it wasn't, boy, it wasn't you
So watch me go
I turn my phone to silent
I catch a train and ride it
Into the night, into the night, into the night I go
I'm flying like a night hawk
I dance along the sidewalk
Into the night, into the night, into the night I go

I've never felt so alive
I'm running into the night
I've never felt so alive
