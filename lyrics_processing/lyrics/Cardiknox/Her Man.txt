I'm staring across the table, thinking, drinking
I'm wishing I was sitting in her seat, pressed up against ya
We could have our very own conversation, my heart's racing
What I wish I could say to you
I'm aching, you're taken

Do you ever think of me when you're with her?
When I see you, I get so weak, I can't speak
I'm just frozen and, baby, you'll never know

I can never tell you how I feel
That to me you're perfect
I can never show you what you do
Gotta keep it a secret
Cause she is my best friend
So I'm going home alone again
My heart is breakin' in two
But I can't ever tell you
Cause I will never have you

What it must be like to feel you breathing, I'm dreaming
I can't get you off my mind, I can't look you in the eyes without shaking
Enough is enough is enough, I've gotta stop this silly nonsense
But what if i'm falling in love?
I'm aching, your taken
You might also like
Do you ever think of me when you're with her?
When I see you, I get so weak, I can't speak
I'm just frozen and, baby, you'll never know

I can never tell you how I feel
That to me you're perfect
I can never show you what you do
Gotta keep it a secret
Cause she is my best friend
So I'm going home alone again
My heart is breakin' in two
But I can't ever tell you
Cause I will never have you

Every Rorschach test, every ink blot mess
It's you I see staring back at me
But the only place I'll ever kiss your face
Is in my wildest dreams

I can never tell you how I feel
That to me you're perfect
I can never show you what you do
Gotta keep it a secret
Cause she is my best friend
So I'm going home alone again
My heart is breakin' in two
But I can't ever tell you
