Just another girl from a small town with big dreams
Just another wild heart who's looking to break free
And the locks on the doors only make me want more of the crown
In the black of the night, there's a hum you can feel in the ground

There's a fire inside of my chest and it won't ever rest
So light up a match because I'm never looking back
Yeah, burn it down because I'm not afraid to crash

I'm gonna rise like a phoenix from the ashes
I'm gonna fly right through the broken glass
And when my feet land on the dirt
You'll feel the ground shake
I'm gonna make my mark
I'm coming like an earthquake
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you

Before the dust even has a chance to settle down
Everything has already changed, just look around

There's a fire inside of my chest and it won't ever rest
So light up a match because I'm never looking back
Yeah, burn it down because I'm not afraid to crash
You might also like
I'm gonna rise like a phoenix from the ashes
I'm gonna fly right through the broken glass
And when my feet land on the dirt
You'll feel the ground shake
I'm gonna make my mark
I'm coming like an earthquake
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you

The blood in our veins is still pumping away
We're alive
Yeah, the blood in our veins is still pumping away
We'll survive
Yeah, the blood in our veins is still pumping away
We're alive
Yeah, the blood in our veins is coursing through us like a train
We grab ahold of both the reins and we are not afraid to crash

I'm gonna rise like a phoenix from the ashes
I'm gonna fly right through the broken glass
And when my feet land on the dirt
You'll feel the ground shake
I'm gonna make my mark
I'm coming like an earthquake
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
