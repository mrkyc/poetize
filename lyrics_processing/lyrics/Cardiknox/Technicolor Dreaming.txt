I've been a river, a drifter
You found me all alone
You sewed me up
With tethers of your love
We barreled through the fog
In a golden sedan
With your hand on my hand
Slept in your parent's bed
Free of the weight we had escaped
Greens, golden browns
Ruby reds I'm drowning in
Am I just
Am I just
Technicolor dreaming?
I learned everything I know
From watching movies
Why can't my life
Have a Hollywood ending?
I'm a fictional perfection
Can't you see me?
Youthfull thoughts of a life
That's deceived me
You might also likeI learned everything I know
From watching movies
The projectors always
Made it look so easy
I'm a fictional perfection
Can't you see me?
Young and foolish
I was technicolor dreaming
Young and foolish
Was technicolor dreaming
I've danced this dance before
The pill bottle tops
That never stay locked
My bones are tired and old
They wither away
I'm sick of feeling this pain
Somewhere out there
Another life awaits
Am I technicolor dreaming?
I learned everything I know
From watching movies
Why can't my life
Have a Hollywood ending?
I'm a fictional perfection
Can't you see me?
Youthfull thoughts of a life
That's deceived me
I learned everything I know
From watching movies
The projectors always
Made it look so easy
I'm a fictional perfection
Can't you see me?
Young and foolish
I was technicolor dreaming
Everything I touch
It turns to gray
Maybe if I just
Burn it to the ground
Let the earth take me
Let the ash remake me
Maybe if I stop
All this make-believe
I can finally rest in peace
I learned everything I know
From watching movies
Why can't my life
Have a Hollywood ending?
I'm a fictional perfection
Can't you see me?
Youthfull thoughts that lied to me
I learned everything I know
From watching movies
The projectors always
Made it look so easy
I'm a fictional perfection
Can't you see me?
Young and foolish
