The storm is rollin' in, I see it coming
Winds are blowin' in, but you and I are jumping off
Diving in the deep, oh, tangled in the sheets
They sky's electric, I feel it buzzing
When everything is quiet, you can hear my blood a-pumping
Oh, I see you in my sleep
Oh, a vision in the heat

I wanna see what you got
Pull my switchblade outta my pocket
Carve our names in the old oak tree
I wanna feel what you got
No more skeletons in our closet
Write our names in the wet concrete

Yeah, you got me on fire, on fire
I got the bloodlust feeling cause I'm on fire, on fire
I'm burning from the fever
With desire and lust, I can never get enough
Feeling dangerous, I'd kill for you
Yeah, you got me on fire, on fire

Your sweat is trickling, the air is thicker
Just for the thrill of it, baby, pull the trigger
Oh, I just need a little spark
Oh, I never miss a mark
Love is wicked, burning at the wick and flickering
Snickering but we're sitting here addicted
Oh, echoes of the heart
Oh, we're shadows in the dark
You might also like
I wanna see what you got
Pull my switchblade outta my pocket
Carve our names in the old oak tree
I wanna feel what you got
No more skeletons in our closet
Write our names in the wet concrete

Yeah, you got me on fire, on fire
I got the bloodlust feeling cause I'm on fire, on fire
I'm burning from the fever
With desire and lust, I can never get enough
Feeling dangerous, I'd kill for you
Yeah, you got me on fire, on fire

I wanna see what you got
Pull my switchblade outta my pocket
Carve our names in the old oak tree
I wanna feel what you got
No more skeletons in our closet
Write our names in the wet concrete
(Yeah, you got me)
I wanna see what you got
Pull my switchblade outta my pocket
Carve our names in the old oak tree
(Yeah, you got me)
I wanna feel what you got
No more skeletons in our closet
Write our names in the wet concrete
(Yeah, you got me)
Yeah, you got me on fire, on fire
I got the bloodlust feeling cause I'm on fire, on fire
I'm burning from the fever
With desire and lust, I can never get enough
Feeling dangerous, I'd kill for you
