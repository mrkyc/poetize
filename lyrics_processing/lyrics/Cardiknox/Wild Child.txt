1, 2, 3, 4!

If  you wanna be tongue tied
You better know where I hide
Under the bleachers with pleasure seekers
I got your baby blue eyes wide
Don't tell me what to do
Go row your own canoe
Like a drummer boy, I rat tat tat
Through all your feedback
I'm at the laundromat singing full blast

Never growing up 'cause I do what I feel like
Never growing up, I'll be young 'til the day I die
Never growing up 'cause I do what I feel like
Never growing up, I'll be young 'til the day I die
I guess I'm just a wild child
I guess I'm just a wild child
I guess I'm just a wild child

The taxis never stop
I guess we'll have to walk
I'm always acting up when the sun's down
They got me screaming out
You might also like
Never growing up 'cause I do what I feel like
Never growing up, I'll be young 'til the day I die
I guess I'm just a wild child
I guess I'm just a wild child
I guess I'm just a wild child

Ever since I was a kid, I been getting in trouble
Ever since I was a kid, I been getting my hustle on
Ever since I was a kid, I been getting in trouble
Ever since I was a kid, I been getting my hustle on
On, on, on and on
I'm forever a wild child

Never growing up 'cause I do what I feel like
Never growing up, I'll be young 'til the day I die
Never growing up 'cause I do what I feel like
Never growing up, I'll be young 'til the day I die
I guess I'm just a wild child
I guess I'm just a wild child
I guess I'm just a wild child
