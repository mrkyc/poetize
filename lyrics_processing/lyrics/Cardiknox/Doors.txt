Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens

Just because I'm breaking doesn't mean I'm broken
Everything I'm up against has gone unspoken
These are feelings, they're not facts, got the wall at my back
And I cannot be defined by the present or the past
By the present or the past

Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh oh oh, my life begins every time a
Oh oh oh, every time a, oh oh oh, every time a
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens

So I look ahead instead, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Walk alone down Rivington thinking 'bout what you said
When I'm diving in the deep, won't always land on my feet
But I'm banging on the door until my knuckles bleed
Until my knuckles bleed

Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh oh oh, my life begins every time a
Oh oh oh, every time a, oh oh oh, every time a
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
You might also like
Digging my feet into the floor
Playing tug of war, trying not to let go
Starting a fire with a torch
They say that less is more
I finally let go

Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh oh oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh oh oh, my life begins every time a
Oh oh oh, every time a, oh oh oh, every time a
