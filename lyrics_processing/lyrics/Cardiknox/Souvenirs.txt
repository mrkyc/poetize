You may be gone, but I saved the mixtape
That you made the old fashioned way
You called in to the radio DJ
And waited for our song to play
You load the deck with a blank cassette tape
You took the time to design the inlay
And wrote down what the songs were saying
On the cover was a heart around my name
On the cover was a heart around my name

All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs
All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs
All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs, souvenirs
All you left me with was souvenirs

You may be gone but I kept the sweatshirt
With the holes underneath the collar
I found it tucked in the back of the dresser
It still smells like the night I met ya
We snuck into the double feature
I spilled my drink on your brand new sneakers
We watched our hero save the world
Right then and there I thought I'd always be your girl
You might also like
All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs
All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs
All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs, souvenirs
All you left me with was souvenirs

Sometimes I open that shoebox and play that old mixtape
I just can't bring myself to throw your sweatshirt away
The ticket stubs we saved, the polaroids we made
The broken bracelet that spelled out your name

All you left me with
All you left me with
All you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs, souvenirs
All you left me with was souvenirs
All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs
All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs
All you left me with, all you left me with
All you left me with was souvenirs, souvenirs
