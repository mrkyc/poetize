The thoughts run through my head
Of you and me lying in bed
The things I never said I wish I said
Over and over and over and over again
Tell me again, we'll never end
And I'll pretend you are a part of me
The best of me, but tragically
I love you endlessly, do anything
Over and over and over and over again
Whatever, whenever, forever and ever
And I'll descend

Anything goes after midnight
Don't you know when wrong feels so right?
Here we are living up the high life

These lips, they keep on trying
But your kiss is worth the crying
I don't wanna run away from your love, your love
Summer heat, it won't stop rising
Burning up, I'm slowly dying
But I can't keep away from your love, your love
You might also like
I watch the sun come up
Sip a cigarette for lunch
Daylight's a sucker punch
Who spiked the punch?
Over and over and over and over again
I'm pulling the pin, playing with sin
Let's do this thing

Anything goes after midnight
Don't you know when wrong feels so right?
Here we are living up the high life

These lips, they keep on trying
But your kiss is worth the crying
I don't wanna run away from your love, your love
Summer heat, it won't stop rising
Burning up, I'm slowly dying
But I can't keep away from your love, your love

Baby, even when I'm dead and gone
You will always be my only one, my only one
When the night is calling
No matter who I become
You will always be my only one, my only one, my only one
When the night is calling
The seconds tick and tock
Evening creeps into my thoughts
I feel the tears drop, but I can't stop
Over and over and over and over again
You're no good for me
But without you, I can't breathe
These lips, they keep on trying
But your kiss is worth the crying
I don't wanna run away from your love, your love
Summer heat, it won't stop rising
Burning up, I'm slowly dying
But I can't keep away from your love, your love
I just can't keep away
