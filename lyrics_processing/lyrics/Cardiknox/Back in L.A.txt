I'm not the kind of guy you do me for
I'm not your dealer with the chemicals
I gave you everything, you wanted more
And I know I was there for you

I don't think we'll ever find a love that treats us like
We treated each other, honey, all we did was fight (I was there for you)
Still I lie awake and I think in a 22
Then I rose with you

We fell in love, one heartbeat, one boulevard
We lit a fire and watched it all fall apart
We left our broken dreams and broken hearts
Back in L.A., back in L.A
We fall in love, one heartbeat, one fall of all
I sing a song while you play on your guitar
We left our broken dreams and broken hearts
Back in L.A., back in L.A

I saw you standing at the corner store
Suddenly nothing mattered anymore
The room had turned into a dance floor
And I know I was there for you
You might also like
I don't think we'll ever find a love that treats us like
We treated each other, honey, all we did was fight (I was there for you)
Still I lie awake and I think in a 22
Then I rose with you

We fell in love, one heartbeat, one boulevard
We lit a fire and watched it all fall apart
We left our broken dreams and broken hearts
Back in L.A., back in L.A
We fall in love, one heartbeat, one fall of all
I sing a song while you play on your guitar
We left our broken dreams and broken hearts
Back in L.A., back in L.A

When we were young
When we were young
Back in L.A

We fell in love, one heartbeat, one boulevard
We lit a fire and watched it all fall apart
We left our broken dreams and broken hearts
Back in L.A., back in L.A
We fall in love, one heartbeat, one fall of all
I sing a song while you play on your guitar
We left our broken dreams and broken hearts
