I know just where I wanna go
But I can't find the first domino
I know right where I wanna be
But there is no road in front of me
There's no escape (I runaway)
For my mistake (To a better place)
There's only faith (I runaway)
The endless maze (To a better place)
So I'm running away

I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
All the things I should've said that I never said
All the things I should have done but we never did
All the things I should have given but I didn't
You might also likeOhh darling make it go away (go away)
Ohh darling make it go away

I never earned all that I got
Now I'll just need all that I'm not
I know right where I wanna be
But there is no road in front of me
There's no escape (I runaway)
For my mistakes (To a better place)
Send my regain (I runaway)
My insides ache (To a better place)
Take my heart away

I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
All the things I should've said that I never said
All the things I should have done but we never did
All the things I should have given but I didn't
Ohh darling make it go away (go away)
Ohh darling make it go away

I kiss you
Say goodnight
Wait till you close your eyes
Then I quietly rise
So through my restless mind

I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
All the things I should've said that I never said
All the things I should have done but we never did
All the things I should have given but I didn't
Ohh darling make it go away (go away)
