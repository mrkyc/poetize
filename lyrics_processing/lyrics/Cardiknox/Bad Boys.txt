Bad boys
Calling all the bad boys

Stay the night
I know you're not the type to stay the night
You left your jacket, so I'm taking it
It smells like cheap cologne and cigarettes
Come and get it

And I give you my love, but my love ain't enough for you
I keep on giving my love, but enough ain't enough for you

All night, why do I go for the bad boys?
Giving it up to the wrong guys
How did I fall for you?
All night, why do I fall for the bad boys?
Maybe I make such a good girl
I can be bad for you

Bad boys
Calling all the bad boys
Bad, bad boys

Dangerous
I feel much safer when it's dangerous
Nothing has to stop , but you're hot as hell
Looking for trouble I can't have myself
I don't wanna

And I give you my love, but my love ain't enough for you
I keep on giving my love, but enough ain't enough for you

All night, why do I go for the bad boys?
Giving it up to the wrong guys
How did I fall for you?
All night, why do I fall for the bad boys?
Maybe I make such a good girl
I can be bad for you

Bad boys
Calling all the bad boys
Bad, bad boys

Ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough
Ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough
And I give you my love, but my love ain't enough for you
I keep on giving my love, but enough ain't enough for you
And I give you my love, but my love ain't enough
But my love ain't enough for you
All night, why do I go for the bad boys?
Giving it up to the wrong guys
How did I fall for you?
All night, why do I fall for the bad boys?
Maybe I make such a good girl
I can be bad for you

Bad boys
Calling all the bad boys
Bad, bad boys

All night, bad boys
Wrong guys, bad, bad boys
All night, bad boys
Good girl, bad, bad boys
All night, bad boys
