I been all alone
I'm skipping stones into the sea
I, I've been so lost that time has caught up to me
I wanna glow from chemicals
My tongue still misses the taste
I'm gonna face all of my mistakes
This time I'm on my way

I'm seeing things so differently
I'm learning that I'm not where I want to be
But trust me, I'm on my way, on my way

And I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
I'm driving through the night with the tank on empty
I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
I don't know where I'm going, but this road will take me
I'm staring at the stars, I got miles ahead
I feel the fire burning, but I'm not there yet
And I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
And nothing's gonna get in my way
Lights blur through the glass
I'm on my last chance outta town
I'm tied up in knots, the engine stops, I'm coming down

I'm seeing things so differently
I'm learning that I'm not where I want to be
But trust me, I'm on my way, on my way

And I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
I'm driving through the night with the tank on empty
I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
I don't know where I'm going, but this road will take me
I'm staring at the stars that are miles ahead
I feel the fire burning, but I'm not there yet
And I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
And nothing's gonna get in my way

I'm seeing things so differently
I'm learning that I'm not where I want to be
But trust me
I've been stuck inside of me
But now I know who holds the key
So turn the locks, I'm breaking free
I'm on my way

And I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
I'm driving through the night with the tank on empty
I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
I don't know where I'm going, but this road will take me
I'm staring at the stars that are miles ahead
I feel the fire burning but I'm not there yet
And I'm not gonna stop, gonna stop, gonna stop
And nothing's gonna get in my way
