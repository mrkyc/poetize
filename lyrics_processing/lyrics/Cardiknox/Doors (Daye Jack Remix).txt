Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens

I'm marching forward, 40 monster feeling focused
Knees hurting, need work, not a day I'm spending moping
Head up, stop a headache, sleep with dreams and magic potions
Some day I'll cross a finish line with pride, a man devoted
I could chase some winnings, medals heavy and gold tokens
Smile on the faces, haters love us in the moment
Cause as roses pass, we could blast spaces in the open
Born a star  touch the moon 
Ain't like a man in some sorrow, feeling weak
Kick a door down, I'mma run, I'mma leave

Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh oh oh, my life begins every time a
Oh oh oh, every time a, oh oh oh, every time a
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens

Lonely days of falling over, been a happy child
, grab your homies,  hold you down
And living solo, it's a hazard, man, knowing now
Broken glass on the floor, habits, never sleeping sound
I'm awake now, running to the leader
Staying hydrated, drinking sucks ass by the liter
Never been defeated, hit a homer, Derek Jeter
Nothing spotty 'bout this boy, a sprinting cat ain't a cheater
Ain't like a man in some sorrow, feeling weak
Kick a door down, I'mma run, I'mma leave

Digging my feet into the floor
Playing tug of war, trying not to let go
I gotta hold on
Starting a fire with a torch
They say that less is more
I finally let go
I need to hold on, I need to hold on

Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh oh oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh, my life begins every time a door closes, another one opens
Oh oh oh, my life begins every time a
Oh oh oh, every time a, oh oh oh, every time a
