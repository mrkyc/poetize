Change in the weather, change in the weather
Something's happening here
Change in the weather, change in the weather
People walkin' 'round in fear

Uh-huh, you better duck and run
Get under cover 'cause a change has come
Storm warning and it looks like rain
Be nothin' left after the hurricane
This here's a jungle, ain't no lie
Look at the people, terror in their eyes
Bad business comin', can't be denied
They're running with the dogs, afraid to die

Change in the weather, change in the weather
Something's happening here
Change in the weather, change in the weather
People walkin' 'round in fear

Uh-huh, you best believe it's true
The levee's busted, badness comin' through
Oh no, there ain't no place to hide
Reach out and pluck you, take you for a ride
Sea of frustration, take everything in sight
Won't be no blessing if we make it through the night
Down on your knees, go ahead and pray
But every demon has to have his day

Change in the weather, change in the weather
People walkin' 'round in fear

High noon, I can't believe my eyes
The wind is ragin', there's a fire in the sky
Ground shakin', everything comin' loose
Run like a coward, but it ain't no use
Edge of the river, it's an ugly scene
People gettin' pushed and people gettin' mean
The change is comin' and it's gettin' late
Ain't no survivin' and there ain't no escape

People walkin' 'round in fear
