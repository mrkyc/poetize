Sinking or swimming that's what we were told, we were young
But no one told us how it was done
Spending your days in a way, which you knew it's begun
Take what you've got, take it and run

So hot, got her reachin' in for the sunblock
She like my style in this way, she hope it rubs off
I ain't here to waste time, you know the man back
Best advice I can give is to stand back
Got the east, south, west, north feeling it
But it Kers shit, they like me on my killer shit
My black bally in a back alley, fuck that
I'ma talk about money with a bud bag
Cruisin' one deep, havin' conversations
You think I'm trippin'? This my way of concentration
I ain't listen to a hater, not in any way
I'm a busy man, you see me, know I'm gettin' pay
I ain't like these other rappers, I'm the opposite
My boys are renting houses just to put the crops in it
Ride it round, got the street mentality
Hustle big you can meet fatalities
Got a flow impeccable, you knowin' what the Kers does
The scene needed savin', they lucky that I turned up
I heard 'em all say nobody perfect
I agree but I gotta say, "Kers is"
Moved outta C-Town when I got funds
But every single hood there I'm still welcome
That's the difference, shit, you know I'm certified
Jealous haters spewing, they were hoping that the Kerser died
Ownin' the world in a world on my own
That deserves a replay, I'm in a world of my own
With the writin' and delivery, man, you cunts are kiddin' me
I got rich off this shit, this is mine and that is literally
I was rappin' 'round the time I got my first pube
I could tell you 'bout my best or my worst move
I could tell you 'bout the beefs that I've been through
But I never lost one, so I don't need to
Fuckin' hell, let me try an' stay positive
You said you promise it, you knowing what a promise is?
Setting levels every time I go and pen bars
Sickest Aussie rapper, man, I know I set the benchmark
Gotta get it any second man the clock stop
Still confused, this is life at the top, Scott
Done the proper way too, like you didn't know
Don't compare me to a rapper, this is different, bro
You feel the goosebumps rise off my low tone
Gifted, haters actin' like they don't know
'Member me in a drain for my film clip
Swappin' shirts with Strace? That was real shit
Beat the struggle with my brothers and we all tight
I don't care if they talk man, they all lie
What they owe man I'm tired of me braggin'
My pockets full if my pants ever saggin'
Get the vibe, check your mates if they don't know
You will find the ones that wanna stay won't go
Kers one droppin' hits for like ten years
How the fuck else do you think that you'd get here?
Take it and run, you can't trust the streets
You can't trust who you trust, put trust in me
Sinkin' or swimmin', I'm driftin' and driftin'
They listen and listen, the sickest, I did it again
You might also like
Sinking or swimming that's what we were told, we were young
But no one told us how it was done
Spending your days in a way, which you knew it's begun
Take what you've got, take it and run

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
