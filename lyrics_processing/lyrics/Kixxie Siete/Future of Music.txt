Nobody knows where the road will go
You are on your own you a rolling stone
And you just keep on going keep on going keep on going on
(Verse 1)
Welcome to the future of music a couple new kids
Tryna Keep it Moving Follow The Revolution
Trying To Start a Movement Cuhz We Ain't Even That Known
But I Feel The Way The City Up on My Backbone
Raised By The Music and The Placed That I Wuz New To
The Hood Affects The Mind of a Child Life Vodoo
Still I Had Dreams of Big Houses and New Coups
Got a Little Local Fame Buzzin off Of Youtube
I Smoke Alot of Weed Im Not a Bad Kid
And Sure I Might Have Done of Handful of Bad Shit
But Thats The Past and I Haven't Looked Back Since
Now All I Ever Wana Do is My Rap Shit
People Telling Me That I Would Never Make it
But I Always Had The Feelin I Wuz Destined For The Greatest
Never Outcame The Haters and Why ?
Cuhz Anybody in This Whole World Can Say Shit Now Face it
(Chorus)
Nobody Knows Were The Road Will Go
You are On Your Own You are Rolling Stone
And You Just Keep on Going Keep on Going Keep on Going On
Nobody Knows Were The Water Will Go You May Never Know
So Just Go With The Flow
And You Just Keep on Floatin Keep on Floatin Keep on Floating on

I Love all The Homies I Swear I Never Leave Them
But I Be Gone For a Minute I Hope They Know The Reason
See I Be Sleepin, Dreamin Schemin
Thinking About That Day I Be Whipping That Lamborghini
Sittin on a Yacht, Sippin on Martinis
Partying With Bitches Wearing Nuthing But Bikins
They Saying Im The Man Laying Out on The Sand
Cathcing Tans While Im Signing These Autographs For My Fans
Blowing Up a Couple Grams on Places Ive Never Been To
Blowin Up a Couple Grand On all The Shit That Im into
Lifes Hard But Im Trying To Keep it Simple
Trying To See Some Good After all The Shit That Ive Been Through
Gotta Get it in From The Position That Im In
Since Im Goinq For The Win Well I Gotta Sink or Swim
They Wonder How They Do it, I say Theres Nuthin To It
I Just Say Whats on My Mind and They Call That Shit Music
(Chorus)
Nobody Knows Were The Road Will Go
You are On Your Own You are Rolling Stone
And You Just Keep on Going Keep on Going Keep on Going On
Nobody Knows Were The Water Will Go You May Never Know
So Just Go With The Flow
And You Just Keep on Floatin Keep on Floatin Keep on Floating on
(Verse 3)
I Take alot Of Time Wen I Be Writing My Raps
Reviewing Revising Lines Before I Put Them on Tracks
At Times I Be Stressed Feeling Lost on The Pad
But The Road To Sucsess Never Came With a Map
The Road and The Test Only Came With The Plan
Plus The Brain and The Pad and The Pen in My Hand
The Beat From The Speakers of The Bass and The Clap
And The Thoughts off all The Things That I Wish That I Had
See The Clock Countin Down I Just Hope I Score
Swisher Sweet Wraps Covering The Whole Floor
I Got a Whole Generation Unspoken For
Microphone in My Hand I Come To open Doors
I Never Passed School Sad To Admit it
But I Bet Id Never be Pursuing Rap If I Didn't
Now That I Have Well Im Glad That I Did it
And I Just it Keep Floating on You Dig it
(Chorus)
Nobody Knows Were The Road Will Go
You are On Your Own You are Rolling Stone
And You Just Keep on Going Keep on Going Keep on Going On
Nobody Knows Were The Water Will Go You May Never Know
So Just Go With The Flow
