Life's good and my weed's a lil' better
Off probation, I can breathe a lil' better
The sun's up, I can see a lil' better
Clear weather, clear weather
Life's good and my weed's a lil' better
Off probation, I can breathe a lil' better
The sun's up, I can see a lil' better
Clear weather, clear weather

This the soundtrack to seventy degrees
With a cool breeze that's coming in from the beach
Good weed that'll surely put you to sleep
Ice cold beer, that's slightly outta your reach
Move a lil' bit, just a lil' bit
Just enough to touch the bottle with your fingertips
It's pretty crazy how we feel so lazy, but
Victory sure tastes sweet when it hits your lips
You hear me speaking, feel sand underneath your feet
You hear this beat when you get up from underneath the sheets
I'm alive, I'ma rise, I'ma shine
Cause it's been a light life as I drive down easy street
And pinch me if I'm dreaming
But I'm good right here, I don't ever plan on leaving
It's ten minutes from the street to the beach
Ain't no better feelin' than smellin' the sea when you breathing

Life's good and my weed's a lil' better
Off probation, I can breathe a lil' better
The sun's up, I can see a lil' better
Clear weather, clear weather
Life's good and my weed's a lil' better
Off probation, I can breathe a lil' better
The sun's up, I can see a lil' better
Clear weather, clear weather

This the soundtrack that kickin' it with the homies
Smokin' and barbequein', crackin' open some forties
Swap stories bout smashin' on shawties
And a lot of it is noise, but boys will be boys
Always out on the block, when we spend our time
Hangin' out just to chill, when we telling our moms
Good thing she don't read in between the lines
Cause I really meant I'm gettin' high before dinner time
We tryna get it to some dumb shit
Whole lot of trouble and everything that it comes with
No worries, we be livin' like some young kids
Waitin' for the honeys to come out when the sun set
And chicks start to think that you sweet
When you take 'em out for a couple drinks by the beach
Set 'em down where the city meets the sea
And you get a little more than a kiss on the cheek
Life's good and my weed's a lil' better
Off probation, I can breathe a lil' better
The sun's up, I can see a lil' better
Clear weather, clear weather
Life's good and my weed's a lil' better
Off probation, I can breathe a lil' better
The sun's up, I can see a lil' better
