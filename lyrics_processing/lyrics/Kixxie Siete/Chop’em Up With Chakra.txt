Yeah, It's Young Kixxie Siete

See I be hungover, with this blunt full of doujer
Roll it up grab a lighter muthafucker get your smoke on
I'm so gone, hydro keep my eyes low
But before we smoke make sure that the blinds closed
Got some neighbors who be thinkin' that my business is their own
But I'm grown I'm just tryin' to get blown so
Leave me alone with this half a zone
Gimmie a pen and pad an I might write you a song bitch
See I be sleepin' finna hit them with some strong shit
Pussy dudes coward on that wizard of oz shit
They be like aww shit Yacht Klub walked in
Bitches yellin' ut they numbers kinda like an auction
It's kinda funny I'am often with a bunch of hot Asian honeys and some foreign whips
They be like kixx what you puffin on some California Reefa
Got me slow got the pussy comin' faster than a cheetah
So best believe it when i'm speedin' through the city
Got yo girlfriend wondering whether or not she gon' see me
Boyfriends turn to the color of a zucchini
Green, jealous yes i'm sorry fellas
I just show a liddo bread leg spread like Nutella
And I really hate to tell you it gets better an better
See the reefa and the cheeda make the world go round
Blow pounds make the high class girls go down
Oh wow, I bet they never thought that this would happen
Skinny Filipino kid that has gotten into rappin'
Now I'm wonderin' what happen to the folks who used to laugh
Bet they on they way to work playing one of my tracks
But they rollin' up a blunt with the volume to the max
Tell they friends back then I was always feelin' this raps
Yeah right but this time you'll be feelin' my wrath
I got millions of raps that make buildings collapse
Chillin' relax hell nah, you ain't got time to
Turn and run in the other directions that powers you
