Uh, lets go
Its kixxie
(Verse 1 - Kixxie )
It's me and Thurz, Me and Thurz
I'm a stick shift spitter throw me in first then i'm gone
By the end of this song they gonna pay up
But they ain't getting reimbursed
I got a demon flow throw me in church
All my homies better pray for me
My big homie always told me to stay hungry
That's the only way to make real money
Establish the brand, supply and demand
Ain't a damn thing they can take from me
Bitch i'm the man i'm to official
I don't gangbang, I ain't toten pistols
Took a risk and pursued my passion
Rolled the dice and took a chance with rappin'
A lot of mothafuckas said I wouldn't get far
But now i'm 22 and I own a business
How you like me now
You a bitch mothafucka how you like me now
I told my manager, he gonna fly me out
Tell your girlfriend she better wipe me down
I'm California dreamin'
Million dollar schemin'
Baby please don't wake me up
Because there's a chance I could be sleepin'
Then I'm gone, I said we gone

Don't wake me up I love this part
Tony Montana when I hustle hard
From them imports and them muscle cars
Big money, Fuck a broad
Business meetings, live abroad
Cocaine, Caviar
The whole squad up on that yacht
Everyone yelling out "Libertad"
I'm a freedom fighter
Hillary Swank when i'm a freedom writer
Put my life on the line when i'm writin' my rhymes
Look at my eyes you can see the fire
Keep in mind that it ain't just me
Theres alot of shit that the team does too
We all float , on the same damn boat
Tryna make a motherfuckin' dream come true
And thats real shit
I be out here trying to kill shit
I done been through from hell and back
So you all can't doubt i'm still kixx
I'm California dreamin'
Million dollar schemin'
Baby please don't wake me up
Because there's a chance I could be sleepin'
Then I'm gone, I said i'm gone
