'Cause I'm not good at faking
And you know I can't take it, I need love, I need love

There's some things I've been meaning to talk about
I get this funny feeling everytime you walk in the house
And I don't know why
Everytime I ask you a question I'm already assuming you gon' lie
Days have gone by, I'm waiting like I'm stuck in a long line
I'm patient but it's been such a long time
And since I, never really see 'em coming down my own eyes
When I write, I'm letting the song cry
I know you the right one but maybe we just met at the wrong time
I got a lot to say, baby, hoping you don't mind
Hoping you don't let go, I'm hoping you hold on
But if you gotta leave me then so long
'Cause I can't take it and I don't know how long this will go on
It's something we can no longer prolong
It's just kinda funny that you had me feeling nothing can go wrong
But it's no fun when you're the one the jokes on

It's been way too long
And I'm not, not that strong
I can't, I can't do it, I can't
'Cause I see it in your eyes that you're not by my side
Oh woah
'Cause I'm not good at faking
And you know I can't take it
I need love, I need love
You might also like
So why all of a sudden you tryna to argue with me?
You tryna end this relationship that you started with me?
Because you tell me lies, then you make it harder for me
To realize that you're actually drifting farther from me
Keep floating baby, I'm hoping you reach the shore
And in the end I hope you grab what you're reaching for
But if you don't find it, don't come crying
'Cause you know I showed you love unlike anything you've seen before
I swear I've seen it all
We built this shit from the ground up
And now it's pretty sad we got to see it fall
When I'm alone I constantly check my phone
And I'm hoping but I know that I'll probably never receive a call
Unaware that I was speaking to a ghost
I don't think you was there when I needed you the most
Now I'm reminiscing on all the things we use to do
Am I in love with you, or am I just use to you?

It's been way too long
And I'm not, not that strong
I can't, I can't do it, I can't
'Cause I see it in your eyes that you're not by my side
Oh woah
'Cause I'm not good at faking
And you know I can't take it
I need love, I need love
I know you don't see me the way I see you
We've grown so far apart
I just can't break your heart
You have been so complicated
Accusing me when I'm frustrated
Never told a lie, stayed by your side
While you were getting high
Feeling all alone
When I should've known
Should've been strong
I know it's time to say goodbye
Oh boy

It's been way too long
And I'm not, not that strong
I can't, I can't do it, I can't
'Cause I see it in your eyes that you're not by my side
Oh woah
'Cause I'm not good at faking
And you know I can't take it
