Got a hunned of us all in the same fit
Rockin' the same hat
Throwin' up the same shit
Ya OG, thas his nephew
Ya big homie, thas his nephew
Tio Mari know the whole hood except you
Tio Mari know the whole hood except you
You don't want that mortician to undress you
Then I'm hopin' that them police protect you
And you better hope ya homies protect you
Never been religious but, god bless you
Tio Mari got some drug dealin' nephews
Tio Mari got some blood spillin' nephews
Tio Mari got some blunt twistin' nephews
Everybody is a nephew except you

Sippin' white wine, in that white bugatti
Thas Tio Mari, thas Tio Mari
Sippin' red Wine, in that red ferrari
Thas Tio Mari, thas Tio Mari

No exception, bitch niggas better learn they lesson
We ain't the type to fuck around, nigga ask no questions
Guaranteed yo ho come around, bet we bound to bless her
My crowd movie proud man, we so progressive
Rollin' down Hawthorne, roll the weed we got more
Hit the store we cop four, Yacht Klub, we on the shore
Hold on before we set sail, make a few before I exhale
Live tha life, what more to tell
Throw it up nigga, raisin' hell

Sippin' white wine, in that white bugatti
Thas Tio Mari, thas Tio Mari
Sippin' red Wine, in that red ferrari
Thas Tio Mari, thas Tio Mari

Vaya con dios, when we ride up on our foes
Wit the toaster out the holster, then we fire and we ghost
But we don't, we stomp em out
It's 310, we let em' know
We tax that ass, then you free to go
More weed to roll, more cheese to blow
Rosecrans to Imperial
Crenshaw to that Inglewood
Man I wish these niggas would
I don't think they hear me tho
Take a couple hits of the beer and dro
Shorty on my dick like here we go
Man I jus fuck her and I leave her in the mornin'
Like pip pip pip pip cheerio
Sippin' white wine, in that white bugatti
Thas Tio Mari, thas Tio Mari
Sippin' red Wine, in that red ferrari
Thas Tio Mari, thas Tio Mari

Tio Mari ain't the type you run in to
He's the life of the parties he's never been to
All that shit you've done, he's been thru
Hopped 4, socked 1, and killed 2
He ain't the type to lounge around and roll it up
Bet ya OGs come thru scared to throw it up
Head mopped, get rocked, man sewed up
Fuckin' wit Tio man, No Luck!!!
Keep it hot, thas how its gotta be
Tio Mari prodigy, holdin' all our prophecies
It's like that, we spike bats
Who the hell gon' fight back?
We write raps in spite that
Knowin' niggas gon' like that

Sippin' white wine, in that white bugatti
Thas Tio Mari, thas Tio Mari
Sippin' red Wine, in that red ferrari
Thas Tio Mari, thas Tio Mari
Got a hunned of us all in the same fit
Rockin' the same hat
Throwin' up the same shit
Got a hunned of us all in the same fit
Rockin' the same hat
Throwin' up the same shit
