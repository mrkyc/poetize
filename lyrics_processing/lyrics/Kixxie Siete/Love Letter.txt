They think I fuckin' love you
But I think I fuckin' hate you
And no matter how hard I try
Its seems that I can't escape you
Wishin' that I could replace you
But I know its impossible
'Cause to find another one like you
Is highly improbable
But I think you so ungrateful
Why must I stay so faithful
Wonder why I'm leanin' on you
When you lookin' so unstable
Are you here to save me
Do you bring a new level of danger
You got me second guessing
Whether you devil or angel
Well is you or ain't you
I can hardly tell
Girl I think we far from heaven
But this is hardly hell
And when you check his eyes
Hes mesmerized it ain't hard to tell
Hes so deep in love
Hes so beaten up
That you can see how hard he fell
How hard he fall
Hard as fuck
Tell me whatcha' do when your brain is movin'
But your heart is stuck
Tell me do you work hard enough
'Cause I heard that you only succeed
When you want that shit so bad
Just as bad as you want to breathe
You might also like
I promise that I ride for you I die for you
I sweat I bleed I cry for you
You only came through every once in a while
But I stayed up every single night for you
Losin' sleep glued to beats
Look at all the things that you do to me
I even stuck it out with you
Though I knew that you wasn't being true to me
Half the time you tell me lies
And truthfully I know you lyin'
But deep inside I know you mine
And that you scared of losin' me
Ain't that right that's the truth to me
And now I feels there's something
That you got to prove to me
'Cause I spent so much time
And they told me time is money baby
Honestly this isn't somethin'
That I'm tryin' to do for free
The homies told me to leave you
They said you be cheatin'
But I felt that I need you
So I didn't believe them

Told my girl that I was at the office
She mad that I don't see her often
Fuckin' wit you all night
She be thinkin' I'm cheatin' on her
And she don't ever care to listen
When I tell her that the shit that you and me do
Can make things a lot better
Instead of clockin' out from my 9 to 5
5 to 9 I be writin' rhymes
All these god damn raps I write
Makin' sure these raps is tight
Look at all this time that I sacrifice
Tryin' to live a motherfuckin' rappers life
Everybody out in the streets gotta eat
And me I got a big appetite
Tryin' to do more than just grab a bite
And if we don't get what we want
Then we get more than we need
Later on in the afterlife
Though I wish that I could erase you
I find you comfort me
Until then ill be waitin'
