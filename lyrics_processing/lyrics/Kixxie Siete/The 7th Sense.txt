Hung around the block, started talking with a accent
My shirt got bigger, my pants started saggin
I remember momma used to blame it on my black friends
I remember back then, long hair, chubby kid
Always in a funny fit, the one that the honey's dissed
And just in case you wondering what happened
I fell into the rhythm, eventually started rappin'
Ever since I realized music was my passion
Beanie to the side, eventually started swaggin'
Got a little older now my shirt's the right size
And my pants a little low, but they fit me just fine
I've seen some bad days, and I've had some great nights
You don't really shine your brightest til you in the right light
And ever since I learned how to grip a mic tight
I been on the grind right, tryna live a nice life
Yo, it's for Goose, hope you listen my boy
I'm down here, 3-1-0, still bringin the noise
I remember you told me that you thought I'd always make it so
I hope you watching over me, protect me from my haters
They only started hating once I got a little famous
Got a price up on my head but that's a chance that I'll be takin'
Cause now, these other careers are sort of whack
Even if I die tomorrow, I'm immortal through my raps
Plus, I like to pour my heart out on the tracks
So when they listen in the future, they gon' know about my past

That's a quick intermission, for those who ain't listen
This the history of hip hop rewritten
I be heat spitting, I ain't never beat skippin'
Let the DJ scratch for anyone flea bitten by this blood sucking parasite
Got these rappers liven lavish lives, but they ain't even half as nice
Half the time, I'm only using up half my mind
You don't need a mastermind, to know that I mastered mine
My poetry, tell me what you supposed to be
My music send love to everybody who's close to me
I'm slow breathing, steady my soul speakin'
To satisfy the crave of anyone dope fiendin'
I be very high, no need to be acting fly
I'm just waving hi, at every cloud that I'm passin' by
