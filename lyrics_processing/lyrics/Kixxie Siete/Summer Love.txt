Yeah, it's Young Kixx
It's yo' boy Robby, 'bout to be
P.O.H.P
Ohhhh, ohhhhh, you ever had that Summer love, yeah, huh
Well let me tell you about mine, yeah, yeah
Oooooh baby, oooooh baby, oooooh baby, yeah (Ahh)
Oooooh baby, oooooh baby, oooooh baby, yeah (It goes a little something like this)

See I remember you was fine in 2009
And now that it's 2010 well you're looking like a dime, shorty,
Hey you looking like you're meant for me
You remember the first chapters of our story
Got me to chick, even though I wasn't the religious type
You got me feelin' like you're heavin's inn
It's pretty evident that I was falling for you 'cause
I would get excited everytime you was textin' me
Long nights talkin' on the phone
Homies tellin' me to party but I'd rather stay home, right
And you remember, I was tryna kick it
But you told me that your boyfriend wouldn't really big it
So, even though you had a man at the time
You was the only girl I had on my mind
And I ain't trippin' 'cause I had to get my mind right
And get my grind right, knew that it would be me and you
Just when the time's right
And now it's 2010, one year later
And you ain't with yo' man no more, and I ain't hatin' but
I never thought ya'll was right together
And you got me writin' songs like I'm writin' letters
Love letters that are written for you, a couple miles away
Hopin' when you get 'em and read 'em I'll help you smile today
Aw, and I don't think I'll find another love
That got me feelin' like this Summer love

Everyone has their own Summer love
Someone special that you cannot get enough
Lowkey gives you funny feelings inside
Always down for you and ready to ride, yeah
My Summer love, oh oh oh oh ohh ohh
My Summer love, ohhh oh oh oh ohhh

My sexy own girl got me pickin' her up like everynight (Everynight)
Tellin' me that she likes having dinner by the candle light (Oh you fancy)
Nice hips, big thighs, girl you just top off alot, (Okay)
Sexy skin, pretty eyes, kind of girl that I might just wife, (Mmhh)
Ooooooooh, (aha aha) got me feelin' like this all the time
Ooooooooh, (tell 'em Robby) you're the only that's on my mind
So baby (aah), just baby (please), keep on being my lady
'Cause without you I'll go crazy fosho, yeah, 'cause

Everyone has their own Summer love
Someone special that you cannot get enough
Lowkey gives you funny feelings inside
Always down for you and ready to ride, yeah
My Summer love, oh oh oh oh ohh ohh
My Summer love, ohhh oh oh oh ohhh
(Check) And then came Fall, went from everyday shopping at malls
To you and me not talking at all
That makes me wonder, "What the fuck happened to us?"
Was the magic not cracking enough, and I don't mean to sound desperate
But damn baby I'ma need you back
I don't care how many rabbits I'm pullin' out of hats
I don't care how many times I wave this magic wand
I can't pretend like there's nothing wrong, come on
I used to see you like all of the time
And now the only time I see you is at night when I'm closin' my eyes
When I'm dreamin', hopin' it'll come true
Damn shorty I'm just hoping that you come through
And if not, well ask me if I care
'Cause I'm doin' quite fine while you're not here (ahh)
And they told me that these Summer loves don't last long
I guarantee this ain't the last song (yeah)

Everyone has their own Summer love
Someone special that you cannot get enough
Lowkey gives you funny feelings inside
Always down for you and ready to ride
My Summer love, ohhhh
My Summer love, ohhhh, yeah yeah, yeah
Who baby, who baby, who baby, yeah
