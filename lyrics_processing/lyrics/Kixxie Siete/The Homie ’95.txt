Yeah, a lil' somethin'
I was at the liquor store the other day
Saw one of the homies he's like
Can I see you for a minute?
So hecame up to me and he was like..

Yo, 'sup Kixx, how you been?
How you livin'?
Remember me, we used to kick it
Back when we was kids
You'd stay right there on the corner of Eucalyptus
And if I remember right, you ain't even speak English (heh)
Where you headed man? Tell me where you headed
Oh I live right there, we going the same direction
Let me walk with you, let me talk with you
Share a little wisdom for homies that's not with you
I heard that you was rappin' now, couldn't help but laugh man
Funny how that happen, you used to have an accent
Long hair, chubby kid, always in some flip flops
Never thought that you'd get into hip-hop
I be god damn, your dad used to listen to rock bands
So when I heard that you was rappin'
I'm like, "Nah, not him. No sir,"
Not Kixx, pops wouldn't allow that
Oh your folks separated, I'm sorry about that
Tell me how's yo' mom's though, I hope she doing good
When it was dinner time
Your house smelled the bombest in the hood
The last time I seen her she was sitting in that Bimmer
And I remember back when yo' family was in that Camry
And I remember back when ya'll was hustlin' the hardest
The family, your father, inside that studio apartment
The hunger in the stomach of the youngin' now was starvin'
You was seachin' for the light, sittin' inside the darkness
The passion in your rhymes just happened to push you farther
The chapter in your life you decided to be the author
I'm hoping that you prosper, hoping that you stand tall
Hoping you don't run into no problems that you can't solve
They gon' trynna raise, half the time is up love
So you push all in and just hope it ain't a bad call
My bad dawg, hope that I ain't ramblin', and rannin'
I'm just hopin' when I talk you understand it
You got the whole hood on yo' back now
The ships sailed a little too far to turn back 'round
I know you feel the pressure and I hope you don't crack now
It's you against the world but I know you won't back down
I know you won't back down, I said I know you won't back down

Alright Kixx, this my stop man
Good seeing you though
I guess I'll catch you on the block
