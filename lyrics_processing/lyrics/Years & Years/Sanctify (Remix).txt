When I pray
When I-
When I pray

In the night, you come to me
'Cause I'm the one who knows who you are
Ooh
Give me your confession
Saying lately, life's been tearing you apart
Now

Walk through the fire with you
'Cause I know how it can hurt
Being cut in two and afraid

So don't break (break)
Sanctify my body with pain (pain)
Sanctify the love that you crave (crave)
Oh, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't be ashamed
Sanctify my sins when I pray
When I pray
You might also like
In the night you come to me
You tell me your mind's not like before
Oh, and you should be home by now
But you don't wanna go there no more
Oh, I know you better than him
I know that you've been hurt
I can feel it from your touch

So don't break (break)
Sanctify my body with pain (pain)
Sanctify the love that you crave (crave)
Oh, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't be ashamed
Sanctify my sins when I pray
Oh, when I pray, oh

You think you're filthy and there's something wrong
In you boy your love is perfect and pure
He will never change the way that you feel
Maybe it's heavenly
Maybe it's heavenly

So don't break (don't break)
Sanctify my body with pain (pain)
Sanctify the love that you crave (crave)
Oh, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't be ashamed (no, no, no)
Sanctify my sins when I pray
Sanctify my body with pain (sanctify, sanctify my sins)
Sanctify the love that you crave (sanctify)
Oh, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't be ashamed (no, no, no)
Sanctify my sins when I pray
Oh, when I pray
