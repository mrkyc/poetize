Oh-oh, yeah

I feel like all these people in this room
Don't shine like you
No, no, no
If I could bottle you up
I would sip ya like cosmic juice
Ooh, ooh, mm

So gimme that good love
Good, good love all night
Don't need your cash
I got my own to spend it on ya if I like
If you wanna dance
Baby, let's dance
We can dream 'til the sunrise

I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do, baby?
I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do?
You might also like
There ain't no reason why
I can't speak, think or stop staring at your glow
No, no, ooh-ooh
I wanna tell ya everything that's on my mind, baby
Even if I choke
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no

So gimme that good love
Good, good love all night
Don't need your cash
I got my own to spend it on ya if I like
If you wanna dance
Baby, let's dance
We can dream 'til the sunrise, woo

I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do, baby?
I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do? (When I get my hands on you)

I'm not giving, not giving you up
I'm not giving, not giving you up, no
I'm not giving, not giving you up
I'm not giving, not giving you up, up, up
No, I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do, baby?
Starstruck
Not giving you up
Starstruck
Not giving you up

I get starstruck around you
What can I do, baby?
