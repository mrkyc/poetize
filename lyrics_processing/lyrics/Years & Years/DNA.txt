What I say about dreams
Did my father believe
Aberrations can steal your child away
And the summer won't end
Young enough to forget
Did the big boys beat it out from you?

And you're reaching for your brother's arms
The two-toned flash of the alarm
I choke, it's too close
And I'm standing on that higher stair
I think I'll run away from here
Yes I'll go, It's too close

Yes I'm gonna show you
That history can change
The patterns of my youth
The cut on my DNA
Yes, I'm gonna pull through
My story is not made
The past is a false truth
I'll break with my DNA

Well, it's time that you stopped
Medicating your shock
Did it always seem so bad for you?
And a personal crime
We both know that you'll find
Blood's much thicker than you ever knew

And you're reaching for your brother's arms
The two-toned flash of the alarm
I choke, it's too close

Yes I'm gonna show you
That history can change (ooh-ooh)
The patterns of my youth
The cut on my DNA (on my DNA)
Yes, I'm gonna pull through
My story is not made
The past is a false truth
I'll break with my DNA (oh with my DNA)

Ooh, oo-oo-oh, ooh, yeah, yeah (x4)
And the moment altered everything
It changed your life
Sweeping over me in the bitter morning light
Yeah the moment altered everything
It changed your life
Sweeping over me in the bitter morning light

Yes I'm gonna show you (you)
That history can change (ah-ah)
The patterns of my youth (my youth)
The cut on my DNA (on my DNA)
Yes, I'm gonna pull through
My story is not made (ah-ah)
The past is a false truth (ooh)
I'll break with my DNA
