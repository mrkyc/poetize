All the lights are focused on you
I can hear applause as your body talks
Rumour has it you're on the loose
What do you adore?
Shall we both explore this fantasy?

Hand on your heart, tell me you want me (Tell me that you want me)
Alone in the dark, I'm going crazy (Crazy)
Don't leave me now, stay at the party (Just stay at the party)
I don't wanna leave without your body

Say you're gonna pick me up
Never gonna put me down
Are you getting me into trouble?
Look at all that, that muscle
Oh, I wanna take a bite
And I wanna take it now
'Cause I wanna get into trouble
Look at all that, that, all that muscle

Midnight at the corner with Jack
Have we met before?
Walk me to your door
I need to see
You might also like
Hand on your heart, tell me you want me (Tell me that you want me)
Alone in the dark, I'm going crazy (Crazy)
Don't leave me now, stay at the party (Just stay at the party)
I don't wanna leave without your body

Say you're gonna pick me up
Never gonna put me down
Are you getting me into trouble?
Look at all that, that muscle
Oh, I wanna take a bite
And I wanna take it now
'Cause I wanna get into trouble
Look at all that, that, all that muscle

All that, that, all that muscle
All that, that, all that muscle
Getting me into trouble
Look at all that, that muscle (Muscle)
All that, that, all that muscle
All that, that, all that muscle
Getting me into trouble
Look at all that, that, all that muscle
Cut through the tension
I don't wanna wait for you to make a move
(Come on, baby, make a move)
No sweet intentions (No sweet)
I don't wanna waste any time, I want you
(You know that I want you)

Say you're gonna pick me up
Never gonna put me down
Are you getting me into trouble?
Look at all that, that muscle
Oh, I wanna take a bite
And I wanna take it now
'Cause I wanna get into trouble
Look at all that, that, all that muscle

All that, that, all that muscle
All that, that, all that muscle
Getting me into trouble
Look at all that, that muscle (Muscle)
All that, that, all that muscle
All that, that, all that muscle
Getting me into trouble
