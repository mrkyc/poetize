Mm

Caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you throwing smiles in my face
Romantic talking? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Looking at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you living the life, but you ain't living right

Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm

I wanna sell what you're buying
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fucking and flying
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm riding
No, no, no, no, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
A time, an incline, God was shining on me
I can't leave
And now I'm acting hella elite
I never want the guys in my league
I only want the ones I envy, I envy

Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like
Call me by your name
Tell me you love me in private
Call me by your name
I do not care if you're lying
