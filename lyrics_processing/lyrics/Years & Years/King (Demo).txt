Cold heart won't you break for me?
I'm not the one for trouble and kings
And if I can keep control
I'll never lose, they'll never know
And I know that you wanna get it
I know that you want your turn
I know that you wanna play it
I know that you wanna run

So hold on, oh hold on
And oh-oh, oh, oh I wanna string your love
And oh-oh, oh, oh I wanna string your love
Oh-oh tonight
Oh-oh, oh, oh let's fight
Oh-oh let's fight
Oh-oh, oh, oh

Don't you wanna be tied to me?
All the things that you want
It's the price
If you wanna hurt that feeling
Did I dream you were looking for me, calling out my name?
I don't wanna try
Cause I wanna hurt that feeling
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna feel like you're letting go
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah I wanna feel like you're letting go
You might also like
It's all in the things you do
Everyone wants a part of you
A portion to keep you there
A boundary to move
A test of your will
And I know that you wanna get it
I know that you want your turn
I know that you wanna play it
I know that you wanna run

Hold on
Can you string me along?
Hold on
Can you string me along?
Oh tonight
Oh-oh let's fight
Oh-oh, oh let's fight
Oh-oh let's fight
Oh-oh, oh, oh

Don't you wanna be tied to me?
All the things that you want
It's the price
If you wanna hurt that feeling
Did I dream you were looking for me, calling out my name?
I don't wanna try
And then it hurts me every time
And I wanna go numb
I don't want to feel
I don't want that soul, I don't want that deal
And the price we pay, to be moved by ya'
Is it worth our fear, is it worth it at all?
I don't know
I don't know

Don't you wanna be tied to me?
All the things that you want
It's the price
Did I dream you were looking for me, calling out my name?
I don't wanna try
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna feel like you're letting go
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
