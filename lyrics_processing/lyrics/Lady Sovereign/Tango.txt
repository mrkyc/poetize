Once again yeah
Make way for the, S-O-V-

Bring out the bucket, bring out the cloth
Bring out the liquid, bring out the lot
If not, let's roll her to a car wash (wooah-wooah)
Now washing you will be like washing a goth
All that black lipstick around their gobs
How the fuck do we get it off?
I think this will be a very hard job!
How did you get a tan like that in winter?
You ran off to Boots and got a box of tinter
Didn't ya?? See, you still got orange fingers!

What network are you on? (Orange)
Colour of your bathwater? (Orange)
Your favorite fruit must be an orange
Bitch, did you know you're orange?

Your clothes keep ripping like you're the female Incredible Hulk
You got a broken bra, a broken top, a broken thong and a broken coat
You been wearing the same jacket since you were in year 8
And it smells like you urinate on it bitch
That ain't great
You tried to be Christina, so you dyed your hair black
But really you look like the Vicar of Dibley (what?) on crack!
Now, just step back and face the facts
You don't like the fact I get feisty on wax
Anyways talking about wax, look at your face! Girl, relax!

Why not fling her on the window sill as a pumpkin
When it's approaching Halloween
Or on your English breakfast, place her next to the bacon
She could be the beans!
And you always know wheres she's been
And you always know when she's had a pee
Cause the toilet seat ain't clean
Cause the toilet seat has an orange sheen!
(Ching!) Bring out the detergent
Scrub that oompa-loompa, it's urgent
Have you seen her face? It's disturbing
How much fake tan are you squirting
Ugh, it's hurting my eyes! And your starting to look like the sunrise
And your fake tan's so ming!
You're attracting flies!
