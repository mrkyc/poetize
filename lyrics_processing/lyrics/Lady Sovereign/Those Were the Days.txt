Eh- this is my cheesy intro
And this is mine
(Right, Yes) It's Lady Sovereign, Big Midget
S-O-V
And this is a song all about I grew up, so yeah
Listen

We used to play jump the line
Or who could wrap the swing around the frame the most times, back in the day
Riding our bikes around the estate and playin' basketball in the cage, those were the days
I remember them water fights, the tap outside
Used to race our bikes
Grinnin' with two front teeth missing, we did what we liked
Those days I'm missin', those days were alright
Knock down ginger
Knock knock then shift
Two minutes later we got locked in the lift
Laughin' when we got out
Got into silly arguments about who found the pound on the ground
Popped to the shops bought about ten ice pops
The weather was hot so they melted in our pockets
Used to carry my belongings in them McDonalds bumbags
That was back then so boy don't mock it

We used to race down the hill in old Safeway trolleys
I wasn't indoors playing with Barbies or dollies
I was outside jumpin' off walls or playin' football
Or getting chased by the local pitbull
The odd character that every borough had
Mad Phillip, Gingerbeard or Mad Max
The places you wouldn't wanna see when you're on your jacks
In the places you wouldn't be in if you stuck to your packs
Stayed out till it was pitch black
Sprayed my name out on concrete slabs
And I never got bitch-slapped
Seen a couple of mans get stabbed
Been chased by the mad man
Gotta get back so I can
Catch a joke with my next door neighbor
We played the first Mortal Kombat on the Sega
Playing the latest jungle tunes we had on cassette
Those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Those were the days

Remember naf naf jackets, and spliffy jeans?
Adidas campus them things were in
It wasn't about the king of the bling
It was about the king of rim, or the king of the swing
Back then well I kinda had less
But less was much better cause it saved a lot of stress
I hung out in Coffers Community Centre
Now they've knocked it down and replaced it with an Asda
My parents way of tellin' us to get our backs in
Was them sounding some old fucking klaxon
We soldier-marched back up to Redcliffe Walk
Chalkhill Estate don't exist no more it's just talk

Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret
Yeah Yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah Yeah
Those were the days- ays- ays -ays
Those were the days- ays- ays -ays
