I wake up late every morning
Managers calling im still yawning
Get up wake up hair and makeups
Waiting for you don't be sawing
This performance is important
I don't think i can put my all in
Hold on i was drunk last night
Now its all kicking in and i don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phones on silent im being polite
Now private numbers get no love from me
Just let me be...
(chorus)
Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
There's no turning back 'cause im working da 9 to 5
To keep my contract did i say i was getting of 1:30
Im no early birdy im lazy dats all dat i can say
So make sure you heard me
And deres no turning back 'cause im working a 9 to 5
So you gotta...do...sum...ite... for...channel...u
Channel who sorry who im altered for snooze
Oh! Channel U da ones dat made me huge

Whoops Im being rude
Wheres my red bull and my sandwich i need food

Never again, am I drinking lambrini
"Its alright Sov it's a dream... jus wake up!"
(chorus)
