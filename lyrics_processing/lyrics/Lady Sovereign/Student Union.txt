It didn't taste nice, in fact it was flat
Sitting at this half bat holly wrap
Student Union bash
You asked me to dance I said no
So I sat on my arse
Watching all these arty-farty
Hooligans trashing the bar
How bizzare?
Went to the courtyard for tobacco and tar
Saw these chicks doing this flex
Wearing tee's but not wearing bras
La, la, la, la, la
It was all, la, la, la, la, la
At the Student Union bar
I was dragged to the Student Union bar
It was crap at the Student Union bar
I was at the Student Union bar
What a headache
Sippin' on cheap drinks and geeks galore
Somewhere I ain't been before
Never went to Uni
And I never was a student
You might also likeI'm a high school dropout
Was a popular loner
Making papers not exams
So, yeah, I brush my shoulders, man
Roll ups, smoking, get up joker
Fuddy duddy in a  sippin' on your vodka
Oh my gosh, I think I might have clocked ya
Is this how you go about becoming a doctor
La, la, la, la, la
It was all, la, la, la, la, la
At the Student Union bar
I was dragged to the Student Union bar
It was crap at the Student Union bar
I was at the Student Union bar
What a headache
At the Student Union bar
I was dragged to the Student Union bar
It was crap at the Student Union bar
I was at the Student Union bar
What a headache
La, la, la, la, la
It was all, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
It was all, la, la, la, la, la
At the Student Union bar
I was dragged to the Student Union bar
It was crap at the Student Union bar
I was at the Student Union bar
What a headache
At the Student Union bar
I was dragged to the Student Union bar
It was crap at the Student Union bar
I was at the Student Union bar
