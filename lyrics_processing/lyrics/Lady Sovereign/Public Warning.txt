Public warning, all bow down
I'm riding here on this beat
Cause I don't give a monkey's what you think about me, mmm hmm
It's on, no long ting, it's on
Ding dong, who's that, peek-a-boo, it's Sov
Yo, ladies and gentlemen this ain't no experiment
It's the uneducated example of intelligence
My irrelevance means more than your irrelevance
It's evident, there's evidence, that I am bloody excellent
Yo, flows are gonna kill ya cause they're bigger and they're badder
When I flow upon a mic I am a heavyweight chatter
You'll get battered no matter with a dutty backhander
If I discover that you are a hater
See? I told you that I'm better
Remember when Betty bought a bit of butter
Well I'm bringing a bit of better, a bit of gutter
A bit of uh uh, a bit of haha
A bit of every little damn thing, heh

Public warning, who's in town?
Public warning, all bow down
Public warning, who's in town?
Public warning, Sov's in town
You might also likeCrown me the pint-size clown of the town
Said I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down
Or I'll be the boogie-woman in a boogie-woman gown
And I'll boogie-woogie you with my boogie-woogie sound
See? I told you that I'm better
Remember when Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
Well I'm picking a bit of better, a bit of gutter, a bit of haha
A bit of every little damn thing
CHING!

Public warning, who's in town?
(Who's in town now?)
Public warning, Sov's in town
I'm that walking dictionary, I'm that talking the-a-saurus
I'm that old-school prehistoric Soversaurus
Raaaaaah, 'ave it!!!
I got a habit of absolutely damaging any track when I attack it
Hmm, see? I told you that I'm raw
'Member when she sold them sea shells on the sea shore
Well I'm selling a little more, a little raw
A little encore please while I drop it hard core now, heh

Public warning, who's in town?
