Oi- Oi this is the midgets mansion
And if you ain't invited, you ain't coming in
(Fire) S-O-V-

It's like bottles smashin', people crashin'
Unnecessary drunken feuds it's fashion
Clean up that spilt drink or you ain't crashin'
My bed's out of bounds so strictly no lashin'
Wheres my debit card nobody move
You ain't getting out of this room until I prove that you didn't take it
And I misplaced it
Now get out of my chair I wanna check face-pic
All these feisty chicks I gotta face it
Even on a Friday evening when I'm wasted
You see this life, well, you're never gonna taste it
I don't associate with waste kids

There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' fucked up
You might also like
Now who's in my yard I've lost count
There's ten downstairs
There's four on the couch
There's five runnin' about
Someone better bounce
Before it's 'ding ding' and your lights are out
Or you get left out like the ginge from girls aloud
Someone's vomiting, gimme the sponge and towel
Allow it, I ain't cleanin' up her sick
Why have another sip if you can't even handle it
Lightweights, I really can't stand them
Stay awake before I do something random
Permanent markers on their face I'll brand them
Now welcome to the midget's mansion

There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' fucked up
Who's reachin', who's getting' what what
Who's reachin', who's getting' what what
Who's reachin', who's getting' what what
Who's reachin', who's getting' woaaaaoo
Who's reachin', who's getting' what what
Who's reachin', who's getting' what what
Who's reachin', who's getting' what what what what what
S-O-V-

So that's me drunk as a skunk
Shouting like some off-key punk
Someone got scared and went to the shop and got my junk food
I wasn't trying to be rude I was in the generation spirit in it
My brethren's dippin' her fries in Guinness in it
I gave her one look and I said bin it, in it
She said she would be back in a minute is it?
Come back next Friday

There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
Who's reachin, who's gettin' messed up
There's a gatherin' where's it at? My yard
