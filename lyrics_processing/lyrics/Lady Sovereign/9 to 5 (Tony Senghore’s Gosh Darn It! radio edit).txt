I wake up late every morning
Manager's calling I'm still yawning
Get up, wake up, hair and makeups
Waiting for you, don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on, I was drunk last night
Now it's all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phone's on silent, I'm being polite
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be...
(Chorus)
Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
There's no turning back 'cos I'm working da 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I am no early birdy, I'm lazy. dat's all dat I can say
So make sure you heard me
And dere's no turning back 'cos I'm working a 9 to 5
So you gotta...do...sum...mit... for...channel...u
Channel who, sorry who, I'm altered for snooze
Oh! Channel U da ones dat made me huge
Like Katie Price's boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Where's my Red Bull and my sandwich I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum
"Action"
Nah I'd actually rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Lets not wake her up actually looks quite cute
You might also like(Chorus)
Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cos I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say dat I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy, I'm lazy dat's all dat I can say
So make sure you heard me
I ain't no early birdy
Won't wake up 'til 12:30
I couldn't be bothered to say much ere
Sooooooooo oh dear
Huh where am I man...
This... ain't good... what's going on?!
So my label have changed my image
I'm a pink lipstick chick called Dipstick
This ain't on my wishlist
Oh shit I'm in FHM posing in a bikini
Next to a Lamborghini
Next stop the theme tune for Tweenies
I'm presenting C-beebies
(pukes) Have u seen me?
Never again, am I drinking Lambrini
"Its alright Sov, it's a dream... jus' wake up!"
(Chorus)
Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cos I'm working da 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say dat I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm lazy, I'll say it again
To make sure ya heard me
I ain't no early birdy
Won't wake up 'til 12:30
And I can't be bothered to say much ere
So I'll say it again
