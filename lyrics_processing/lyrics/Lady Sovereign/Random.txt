E'rybody in the club gettin tipsy
Oh fuck dat, just whine like a gypsy
Can't see straight, like I got one eye
Pop your bottle open oh my
Let's... get started
Move ya arms round like fucked up karate
Ohh, shit! My word play's nasty
Ohh, shit! Don't put it past me
Move, titch - get out the... way
Nah never that I'm here to, stayyyy
Flow lazy
Pick the pace up when I flow less hazy
J-Lo's got a batty
Well you can't see mine cause I wear my trousers baggy
Anyways, yeah, let's commence

Smokin' kills and so do my lyrics
If you're poppin' pills then trust you're not with it
'Cause I got the skills, and I'm over the limit
Dishin' lyrics like meals, every second, every minute
Ding! Dong! Special delivery (hello)
Biggest midget in the game, can't get rid of me
Give me just a minute and I'll be in your vicinity
My words hurt you just like losin' virginity (oww!)
Well I'm, right thurr
Naw, tell a lie cause I'm right there
Right hurr, nah, right here
Now get off your churr, I mean chair
Some English MC's get it twisted
Start sayin' COOKIES instead of biscuits!
Anyways, yeah, let's commence

Everybody get random, all gyal dem, all man dem
Everybody get random, just do somethin' random

One, two, Sov is comin' for you
Three four, better lock your door
Five six, well I'm full of tricks
So everybody come and vibe with the likkle titch
Swiiiiiitch
Just check how my flow differs
I'm droppin' lyrics like a ho droppin' knickers
I'm on a whole other level, I'm old school
Like Marathon, prior to Snickers
This shit's hot, where the sniffer dogs?
Let's get random, zagga-zagga-zagga zog
You wanna come test me well bring it on
This is the new ting, the new singalong
S-O-V!

Everybody get random, all gyal dem, all man dem
