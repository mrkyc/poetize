Me, you, yeah, yeah, everyone
We've had one of those days, but listen, mate, you cannot relate
I'm a star, I'm an individual, uneducated example
Of intelligence, I'm considered to be cool
Had bad days, offended people
The mood of age, bitten on innocent people
Anyways, things change, always at the hotel
Always, I'll be gone again in four days

I've been waiting hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish to stay, and sleep today, yeah

I'm so human (Yeah, yeah) and it's okay (Yeah, yeah)
For me to feel this way (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still human (Yeah, yeah), it's okay (Yeah, yeah)
For me to feel this way (Yeah, yeah)
(Ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah)
(Ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, you, me, everyone
I got a little temper, but I'm a funny one
Yeah, and when the beat went on and I really fucking had enough
You shoulda seen me runnin' out the studio like Forest Gump
Drugged up, shut up, taxi getaway
Trapped in the US, my accent is my giveaway
I need a bag of green to make it go away
And this is another day of my life and so I say
You might also like
I've been waiting hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish to stay and sleep today, yeah

I'm so human (Yeah, yeah) and it's okay (Yeah, yeah)
For me to feel this way (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still human(Yeah, yeah), it's okay (Yeah, yeah)
For me to feel this way (Yeah, yeah)
(Ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah)
(Ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah)

Doesn't it feel much better, uh-huh
When you've had a better day than yesterday?
Doesn't it feel much better, uh-huh
When you've had a better day than yesterday?
Doesn't it feel much better, uh-huh
When you've had a better day than yesterday?
Doesn't it feel much better, uh-huh
When you've had a better day than yesterday?
(Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday)
(Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday)
(Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday)
(Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday)
I'm so human (Yeah, yeah) and it's okay (Yeah, yeah)
For me to feel this way (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still human (Yeah, yeah), it's okay (Yeah, yeah)
