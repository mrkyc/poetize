I wake up late every morning
Manager's calling, I'm still yawning
Get up, wake up, hair and makeup's
Waiting for you, don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on, I was drunk last night
Now it's all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phone's on silent; I'm being polite
Private caller's gettin' no love from me
Just let me be

Oh my gosh, my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back; I'm working the 9 to 5
Just to keep my contract, did I say 9? I meant 1:30
I ain't no early birdy, I'm working the 9 to 5

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

"So you gotta do some idents for Channel U"
Channel who? Sorry, I'm halfway through a snooze
Oh! Channel U, the ones that made me huge
Like Katie Price's boobs
Whoops, I'm being rude
Where's my Red Bull and my sandwich? I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like Pampers, throwing a tantrum (Action!)
Nah, actually I'd rather catch my Z's and count sheep in my sleep
"Ah, let's not wake her up, she actually looks quite sweet"

Oh my gosh, my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back; I'm working the 9 to 5
Just to keep my contract, did I say 9? I meant 1:30
I ain't no early birdy, I'm working the 9 to 5

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I'm not sure what day just started
Since my working week departed
Ever since our single charted
This pursuit's been everlasting
I clocked in about a year ago
And I haven't clocked out from the studio
And videos and TV shows
And staring out the window on the road
And and although sometimes we don't get paid
For these rampages on these stages
I know that I won't get jaded
I won't go back to my minimum wages
Oh my gosh, my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back; I'm working the 9 to 5
Just to keep my contract, did I say 9? I meant 1:30
I ain't no early birdy, I'm working the 9 to 5

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
