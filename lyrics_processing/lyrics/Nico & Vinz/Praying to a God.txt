She's praying to a God who won't talk back
Her faith is dying, tears are a sign she's going off track
She's praying to a God who won't talk back, won't talk back
Down on her knees and praying to a god who won't talk back

Her momma believed that the devil had a dress on
So she's out on the town tonight, she got her best on
Her daddy believed that the needle was a highway
So she powders her nose, she's just looking for direction
It gets hard to feel the friction underwater
As she's breaking down, she's tearing at the borders
In too deep to save herself, she takes a pill that seems to help
Close her eyes and pictures standing at the altar

She's praying to a God who won't talk back
Her faith is dying, tears are a sign she's going off track
She's praying to a God who won't talk back, won't talk back
Down on her knees and praying to a god who won't talk back
She's praying to a God who won't talk back
Her faith is dying, tears are a sign she's going off track
She's praying to a God who won't talk back, won't talk back
Down on her knees and praying to a god who won't talk back
