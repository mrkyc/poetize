This feeling here with you
It's in the way you move
Underneath the sky, the stars, the moon
I can feel it in your touch
The fire burning from your fingertips
Oh baby what a rush
The feeling of your heartbeat on my lips
Without you I can't live

When I look into your eyes
I see so clearly everything I need
Oh how can we survive
When the world outside will never let us be
Without you I can't breathe
