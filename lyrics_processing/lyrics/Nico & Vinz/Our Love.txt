I see you holding it in
I never, ever want you feeling this way
Let it out, I know I've been gone
I still love you baby, nothing has changed

Been caught up working every day, every night
And we're drifting apart
It's my fault, but I'll make it right, make it right
I'm going back to your heart

For our love, our love
Everything can wait, everything can wait for our love
And right now, right now
I will find a way, so you don't have to wait for my love
For our love, our love
Everything can wait, everything can wait for our love
And right now, right now
Nothing's in the way, so you don't have to wait for my love

You're right here, right by my side
Ready to pick me up when I'm down
But I failed to show you that I
Appreciate it when you're around
You might also like
Been caught up working every day, every night
And we're drifting apart
It's my fault, but I'll make it right, make it right
I'm going back to your heart

For our love, our love
Everything can wait, everything can wait for our love
And right now, right now
I will find a way, so you don't have to wait for my love
For our love, our love
Everything can wait, everything can wait for our love
And right now, right now
Nothing's in the way, so you don't have to wait for my love
I'm going back to your heart

Everything can wait for you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
That's how much you mean to me yeah
So I'm making time

For our love, our love
Everything can wait, everything can wait for our love
And right now, right now
I will find a way, so you don't have to wait for my love
For our love, our love
Everything can wait, everything can wait for our love
And right now, right now
Nothing's in the way, so you don't have to wait for my love
For our love, our love
Everything can wait, everything can wait for our love
And right now, right now
I will find a way, so you don't have to wait for my love
For our love, our love
Everything can wait, everything can wait for our love
And right now, right now
