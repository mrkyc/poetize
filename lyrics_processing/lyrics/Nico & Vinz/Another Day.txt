I used to pray every night when I was younger
On my knees, folding hands with my mother
And my mother used to say when she was younger
She used to go to bed filled with hunger
That same hunger got her working even harder
Got her travelin' to Norway from Ghana
She said, "My son, we're blessed, now let's say Our Father"
Ups and downs, that's how life go
What's high if you don't know low?
So I try not to complain
Appreciate life, man, I keep saying

Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive
Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive

I think I was about ten years old
Watching the news with my dad
I didn't see nothin' but tears and blood
And a bunch of people looking so mad
"That's war," I was told
I said, "How? That ain't nothing like the games I have"
I couldn't grasp the sense of an innocent child
Dyin' by the hands of a grown man
And while some kids raised on cartoons
Young girls making money in dark rooms
We all deserve a decent meal
Why his belly so soft? Why she holding that hard spoon?
And where is my Head of State?
If crime pays, talk peace, still engaging in heavy arms trade
In the jungle that we call Sin City
Wild life rules, survival of the fittest

Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive
Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, yeah
Why, why, why, why
Yeah
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Thank God that I'm alive
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, yeah
Why, why, why, why
Yeah
Eh, eh, eh, eh
