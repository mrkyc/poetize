I look in the mirror and I ask myself-self-self-self-self who I see
Who I've become and if I will stand up for my-y-y-y-y beliefs
Father told me to listen to my heart
And don't do what doesn't feel right
So my conclusion is I am who I am and everything that I am not

I've been wonderin' and wonderin' and trying to find a home
With these questions I'm asking, it feels like I never know what

Yeah, I know what I'm not
Yeah, I know what I'm not
I keep searching, don't know if I'll stop
This I know, this I know
Yes, I know what I'm not

I've been a victim of trying too hard, now I finally see
That every person was find its own path
I won't be who they want me to be
They said that I should act a certain way
And I would listen, what a great mistake
It's my life and my choice to make
Now I know what I'm not

Put your worries on a plane
(Let them fly, let them fly, let them fly)
Send them on a helicopter
(Let them fly, let them fly, let them fly)
Pour all of your sorrows over board (Over board)
Tell 'em we don't need 'em anymore (Anymore)
Lift your feet up off the edge
(Say goodbye, say goodbye) To the past
No, don't look behind
No, won't paint their eyes
No, don't look behind
No, fly, baby, fly
Fly, baby, fly
