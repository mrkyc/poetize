To tell the truth, I can't pretend
I had to see your face again
You're what I came out for
You're what I came out for
I didn't get the chance last time
Just had to say what's on my mind
You're what I came out for
You're what I came out for

I don't know if you know
You're the one that I'm here for
You're so close, but so far away
Still every time feels special
Lady, I would love to say hi
I make it hard when it's simple
You're looking like you feel it too
Is it true?
Girl, you see I don't even know this place
But I had to see your face
And I'd like to say how I feel, feel

To tell the truth, I can't pretend
I had to see your face again
You're what I came out for
You're what I came out for
I didn't get the chance last time
Just had to say what's on my mind
You're what I came out for
You're what I came out for
You might also like
I'm just so cool when I turn my head
You turn around and I lost my ways
I was mesmerized that day
It was in your eyes that day
I can not forget your smile
Like I gotta go back
I don't even hang in this area
I don't even stay in this area
I just come around to see you
I just come around get a glimpse of you
I call my boy like oh oh oh oh
I met a girl and she so, so, so, so
Perfect for me, this I know, know, know, know
For sure, for sure
You see, I don't usually come this way
But I had to see your face
And I'd like to say how I feel, feel

To tell the truth, I can't pretend
I had to see your face again
You're what I came out for
You're what I came out for
I didn't get the chance last time
Just had to say what's on my mind
You're what I came out for
