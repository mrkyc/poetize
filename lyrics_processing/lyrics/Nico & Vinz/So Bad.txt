Nico & Vinz

Look, we had loving and friendship
Soft kisses and blessings
We shared moments and feelings
Now that's all gone in the distant
You changed up, I don't know you
Got someone I don't know of
My whole heart beated for you
But I just can't afford you

So why do I want it so bad?
Can't give you up like you're all I ever had
So many wrongs, I know we can't ever last
Don't understand why I just can't dash
Lord, let me know

Why do I want it so bad if it's so, so bad, so bad
Why can't I never let go like you're all I have, I have
I should be leaving you
I'm way too good to you
Why do I want it so bad if it's so, so bad, so bad
You might also like
See, I got earth, wind and a little fire
Rain and thunder and desire to be with you
To be with you
Still we can't get it to where it's supposed to be
Our pedal's dried out like
All you say you got love for me
All your words ain't enough for me

So why do I want it so bad?
Can't give you up like you're all I ever had
So many wrongs, I know we can't ever last
Don't understand why I just can't dash
Lord, let me know

Why do I want it so bad if it's so, so bad, so bad
Why can't I never let go like you're all I have, I have
I should be leaving you
I'm way too good to you
Why do I want it so bad if it's so, so bad, so bad

And I don't wanna let go
But I know that we can't go on
I love you, baby, so deep
But I'm drowning, baby, slowly
When it's good, it just feels so right
But I can't keep you in my life
Why do I want it so bad if it's so, so bad, so bad
Why can't I never let go like you're all I have, I have
I should be leaving you
I'm way too good to you
