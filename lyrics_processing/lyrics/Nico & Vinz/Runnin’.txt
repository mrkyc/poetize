Ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
Ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
Now ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
Baby, ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
Ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
Ooh, don't fall, run away, run away

Don't want the best of you, but I want the pearl
Open your treasure and come into my world
Say, "Baby"
You knockin', you knockin', you knockin'
Your hands are sore
Baby
You tryin', you tryin', you tryin'
The hardest gloves
Baby
You fallin', you fallin', you're down and
It's too deep, oh yeah

It ain't your fault, my lady, time
Is not for us
Don't you go leavin'
Your presence is way too good
At least I'm honest about it all
Don't you know? Girl, you know, I'm
You might also like
Too little to love
But I'm in love with you loving me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Too little to love
But I'm in love with you loving me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Runnin' from me
Runnin' from me

I say I hate to break it down so cold
Ooh shit, so cold
But I don't wanna give you false hopes
Hopes, false hopes
Even your friends will say I'm so wrong
So wrong, so wrong
Though I know in my heart you got it
I ain't giving you nothin' but lovin'
 
It ain't your fault, my lady
Time is not for us
Don't you go leavin'
Your presence is way too good
At least I'm honest about it all
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Too little to love
But I'm in love with you loving me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Too little to love
But I'm in love with you loving me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Keep runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin' from me

I know it's not easy, easy
Yeah, not easy, yeah
Said I know it's not easy, easy
Yeah, not easy, yeah
Said I know it's not easy, easy
At least you know where know we stand
Telling the truth like a gentleman
Telling the truth, I'm a gentleman

Ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
Ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
Now ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
Baby, ooh, don't fall, run away, run away
I ain't ready to retire, I ain't ready to tie down
Even though you take me higher
Woah, take me high above the ground
I love the way you, way you
Way you tell me with love
Oh but either way, I don't wanna tie down

Too little to love
But I'm in love with you loving me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Too little to love
But I'm in love with you loving me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Keep runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin' from me
Too little to love
But I'm in love with you loving me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Too little to love
But I'm in love with you loving me
Keep runnin', runnin' from me
Keep runnin', runnin'
