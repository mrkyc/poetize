Lookin' up toward the friendly skies
Everything that I thought I had
Taken right before my eyes
Oh yeah
Give me faith, give me love, Cause I need it!
Show me grace, make me strong, let me feel it!
Where to go, Can I walk to redemption
Don't know how I'll be okay
But I'll find a way
Said I'll find a way
Don't know. How I'll be okay
But I'll find a way
Do you remember, that when we used to play?
Do you remember, when you put me in my place?
Do you remember, when you told me I should go?
And I left you fighting all alone?
I see the writings on the walls
I feel it coming. Yes I do
Us together like before
I don't know how we'll be okay
But i'll find a way
I don't know how we'll be okay
But i'll find a way
No matter way, No matter way
I am gonna see any way
No matter way, No matter way
I am gonna see any way
To lord your boar to lord your terror I pray
To lord your boar to lord your terror I pray
Cause I've waited finally shout
To open up my mouth and let the truth come out
Yes i'll say it without a doubt
Don't know. How I'll be okay
But I'll find a way
(Say!) I will find a way
(Say!) I will find a way
(Say!) I will find a way
(oh!) I will find a way
(oh!) I will find a way
(whoow!) I will find a way
I will find a way (Oh! ...Oh!...oh!)
(Say!) I will find a way
(Say!) I will find a way
(Say!) I will find a way
(oh!)I will find a way
(oh!) I will find a way
(whoow!) I will find a way
I will find a way (Oh! ...Oh!...oh! Say!)
Said I Will find a way oh. oh
Said I'll find a way oh... Oh
