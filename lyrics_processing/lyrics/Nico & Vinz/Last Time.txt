Yeah
I see the stars in your eyes
And you know you've lost your disguise
When I hit that with a bang
When I'm in that you're insane, oh
(Work it, work it, work it)

In a cave, on the dock, on the roof, everywhere
Under the clouds when it rains, I don't even care
Nothing can keep me from your loving, no way
Climb a mountain long as we got peace
I can please you on a desert, the bottom of the sea
No matter where we are

Tonight we're making love like our last time
Like our last time
Like our last time
Like our last time
Last time

You got what I need, yo, I know it might sound crazy
But I'm drowning in your sea and I don't want nobody to save me
Girl, something in your eyes making it hard for me to leave
So hard for me to leave, you make it too hard for me to leave you, oh
(Work it, ride it, work it)
You make it hard for me to leave
(Work it, ride it, work it)
You make it hard for me to leave
Dance on top, on top, on baby, just dance on top, on top
Dance, don't stop, oh baby, let's dance all night, all night
You might also like
In a cave, on the dock, on the roof, everywhere
Under the clouds when it rains
I can please you on a desert, the bottom of the sea
No matter where we are

Tonight we're making love like our last time
Like our last time
Like our last time
Like our last time
Last time

I call it two-by-two
Good lovin', me and you
I call it two-by-two
Good lovin', me and you
I call it two-by-two
Good lovin', me and you
I call it two-by-two
Good lovin', me and you

(Love the way you are)
(Way you are, nah nah)
The way you call it
The way you got me
Way you call it
The way you got me
(Work it)
(Work it)
(Work it)

Tonight we're making love like our last time
Like our last time
Like our last time
Like our last time
Last time

I call it two-by-two
Good lovin', me and you
I call it two-by-two
Good lovin', me and you
I call it two-by-two
Good lovin', me and you
I call it two-by-two
