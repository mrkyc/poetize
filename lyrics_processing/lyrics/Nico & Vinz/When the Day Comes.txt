I'm ready for war
Come into town and I'm high on the horizon
In the city of God
Fighting the town with my feelings aside
When it's two in the night
The fire in my heart's gon' keep me alive
And I'm ready for war
Woah, woah, woah

The voices in my head
Is telling me that I should stay in my bed
'Cause it's two in the night
Why can't I sleep when it's two in the night?
It's the fire in my soul
The fire in my soul got me ready to fight
And I'm ready for war
Woah, woah, woah

Climb the streets at night, found my way over
You know I've been so lost in translation
Like I'm fighting for truce in Babylon
Trying to find my peace in the zone of war

Even when the day comes (Yeah), even when the day comes (Oh)
Even when the day comes, even when the day comes
Even when the day comes, even when the day comes
Even when the day comes, I'll be ready when the day comes

I'm ready for war (Woo)
I'm ready for action, now watch me kick in the door (Woo)
But what if the day comes when we go from sun to monsoon?
Who can I run to, run to, run to?
Will you be loyal, will you be true when I need you?

Say, climb these streets and I found my way over
You know I've been so lost in translation
Like I'm fighting for truce in Babylon
Trying to find my peace in the zone of war, woah

Even when the day comes, even when the day comes (Yeah)
Even when the day comes, even when the day comes
Even when the day comes, even when the day comes
Even when the day comes, I'll be ready when the day comes

Even when the sky comes falling down
I'd be ready when the sky comes falling down
Today I will march for me
Today you will march for you, oh
We raise our arms and hope for better ways
We fight a million battles every day
I don't wanna see us falling (Oh yeah)
So we just gotta keep on running (Oh yeah)
Even when the day comes calling (Oh yeah)
I'm ready to march on

Even when the day comes, even when the day comes
Even when the day comes, even when the day comes
Even when the day comes, even when the day comes
Even when the day comes, I'll be ready when the day comes

Even when the sky comes falling down
