Finding patience in this whole foul life
When I can see no right
With no hope inside
Blind
All the worries I bring home at night
Suffocate all life
Just wanna close my eyes
I

I know, I know I see it, it all fades to black
I know, I know this can't be light

So hold me tight, my maker
Don't you let me go
I've been close to falling off
And I can't hear you anymore
Hold me tight, my maker
Don't you let me go
I've been lost walking this road
And I need you to show me home

Headlights
Headlights
Headlights
Headlights
Lead me through the darkness in these troubled times
You might also like
I never know how much she meant to me
And I will never be
Who's gonna rescue me, now
Your blessings must forget my trees
'Cause all I got is fallen leaves
I'm in way too deep, drowning

I know, I know I see it, it all fades to black
I know, I know this can't be light

So hold me tight, my maker
Don't you let me go
I been close to falling off
And I can't hear you anymore
Hold me tight, my
Don't you let me go
I been lost walking this road
And I need you to show me home

Headlights
Headlights
Headlights
Headlights
Lead me through the darkness in these troubled times
I been thinking lately
Asking if I'm doing grace by the ones who made me
If I'm worthy of the title of the skincolor
Queen Sheeba, my grandmother
Pharaohs, my great grandfathers
'Cause now I'm deep in the vixen
As looking Egyptian
I saw from a far she was a star
Brought her home and made her sweat in my manager's car
Told my girl I'm working late
She could call me tomorrow
Man, it's been so many that I'm losing the count
I'm singing sweet songs, guess I had to balance it out
But yes, I been lost, I been down the wrong course
Still most people would tell me the boss
Put up a toast for the baddest man with the cash in hand
And courage and all his kids to be bad as him
Living the life that we used to be imagining
Back when it made me grab the pen
See, I used to be the no-go
The dude in the back
The school joe blow
I made a million dollars
Suddenly I had mojo
Calling up girls I couldn't talk to in class
And slept with them
Even if they grew up out of their ass
You couldn't tell me I was living too fast
I'm living too fast
And everyone applauds it
But I'm hollow and sad
So do I want the Marilyns or baby Sheba's
I need some headlights
Got to find the way 'fore I crash
Hold me tight, my maker
Don't you let me go
I been lost walking this road
And I need you to show me home
