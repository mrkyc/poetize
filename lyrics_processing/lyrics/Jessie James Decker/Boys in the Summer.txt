It's hot as hell even in the shade
Squeeze you a little bit of lemonade
Wearing next to nothing and we like it
Coconut oil running down our backs
Girls trying to give the guys a heart attack
Baby, there's no denying

The reason for July
Skinny dipping and checking out tan lines
Making out underneath the moonlight

Oh, yeah, yeah
Boys look so much hotter in the summer
Yeah, yeah
Take your shirt off
Let the water pull me under
Oh, I must be dreaming
Oh, you got me singing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Stand the heat, and you're kissing on me
Standing in line at the Dairy Queen
You slip your hand in my back pocket, ah
Driving down the road
Feet hanging out the window
Fifteen miles and we've got no place to go
And I don't care cause I like ya
You might also like
We're underneath the stars
Laying here on the hood of your car
Baby, I barely know who you are

Oh, yeah, yeah
Boys look so much hotter in the summer
Yeah, yeah
Take your shirt off
Let the water pull me under
Oh, I must be dreaming
Oh, you got me singing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Summer only lasts so long
And there's nothing wrong
With having some fun, yeah
No need to apologize
Just close your eyes
And kiss on me tonight

It's hot as hell even in the shade
Squeeze you a little bit of lemonade
Wearing next to nothing
And we like it
One, two, three
Yeah, yeah
Boys look so much hotter in the summer
Yeah, yeah
Take your shirt off in the water, pull me under
Oh, I must be dreaming
Oh, you got me singing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Boys look so much hotter in the summer
Yeah, yeah
Take your shirt off in the water, pull me under
Oh, I must be dreaming
Oh, you got me singing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Boys look so much hotter in the summer
Yeah, yeah
Take your shirt off in the water, pull me under
Oh, I must be dreaming
Oh, you got me singing
