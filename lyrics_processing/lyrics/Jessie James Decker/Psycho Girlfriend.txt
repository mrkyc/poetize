*Screaming*
Do, do, do, do, do, do

I hate your friends and family
They're tryna take you from me
Oops, I forgot to take the pill again
Did I forget to mention? I need all your attention
Or else I'll throw a tantrum for it
Check your phone
Check your mail
Check your pockets
Might as well
It's a test
It's a game
It's just begun

Psycho girlfriend
So you say
But you ain't tryin' to run away
You keep coming back for more (Back for more)
Baby, when we're makin' love
I make you think I could be the one
Guess you never had it this good before
You might also like
I call you when you're working
Over and over again
Accuse you that you're cheating when you're not
Some mind manipulation
Mixed with cleavage persuasion
A recipe for getting what I want
Insecure
In denial
Immature
Like a child
Start a fight
Tell a lie
Just for fun

Psycho girlfriend
So you say
But you ain't tryin' to run away
You keep coming back for more (Back for more)
Baby, when we're makin' love
I make you think
I could be the one
Guess you never had it this good before (Good before)

And oh, what I'm doing, baby
You forget that I'm crazy?
I know what I'm doing, baby
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Should've known I was nuts from the get-go
Now you're hooked and you can't seem to let go
Your friends hate my guts, but they don't know
What it's like being loved by a
Mmm, mmm
Psycho girlfriend
So you say
But you ain't tryin' to run away (Run away)
You keep coming back for more (Back for more)
Baby, when we're makin' love
I make you think I could be the one
Guess you never had it this good before (Never had it this good)
Psycho girlfriend
So you say
But you ain't tryin' to run away (But you love it)
You keep coming back for more (Back for more, oh)
Baby, when we're makin' love (Love)
I make you think I could be the one (I could be the one)
Guess you never had it this good before

Ooh, ooh, mmm, hey
I could be the one
You ain't going nowhere, no
Do, do, do, do, do, do
