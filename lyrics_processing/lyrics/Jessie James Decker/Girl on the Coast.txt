Summer, summertime
And the feeling is breezy
And I'm living easy
And the sun, the sun, it shines
Was only here for the weekend
But I'm never leaving

Take me down to the beach, by the coconut tree
Your hand in my hand, lemon in my iced tea
Rolling in the sand
Salty kisses on my tan
And we're sipping our mojitos
With sand in my toes
Every boys on the shore, nowhere to go
Just a girl on the coast
I'm just a girl on the coast

And I'm singing
Hey, I'm okay
But if you want me, this is where I'm gonna be, uh uh
I'm just a girl on the coast

Blue, how blue is the sky?
Palm trees are shading
And the sun is blazing
And I close, I close my eyes
I hear the waves are crashing
And I'm here relaxing
You might also like
Take me down to the beach, by the coconut tree
Your hand in my hand, lemon in my iced tea
Rolling in the sand
Salty kisses on my tan
And we're sipping our mojitos
With sand in my toes
Every boys on the shore, nowhere to go
Just a girl on the coast
I'm just a girl on the coast

And I'm singing
Hey, I'm okay
But if you want me, this is where I'm gonna be
I'm just a girl on the coast

I have never felt so free
I'm happy here, swimming in the sea
I guess the mermaid life is just for me

Take me down to the beach, by the coconut tree
Your hand in my hand, lemon in my iced tea
Rolling in the sand
Salty kisses on my tan
And we're sipping our mojitos
With sand in my toes
Every boys on the shore, nowhere to go
Just a girl on the coast
I'm just a girl on the coast
And I'm singing
Hey, I'm okay
But if you want me, this is where I'm gonna be
