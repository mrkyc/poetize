I should get gone
I shoulda smiled and walked on by
All the smoke and the neon
Ain't bright enough to hide your eyes

I wasn't lookin' for love
I was lookin' for a nightcap
I was about to head home
'Til you walked in lookin' like that
And now we're dancing real close
With your hands on my back
Oh, you got the same kinda something
You always used to

I was almost over you
Wasn't thinking 'bout you at all
Now it's like all I can do
Is hold on 'til the last call
Pray that you come home with me
And stay the whole night through
Maybe longer if you do
I was almost over you
You might also like
This should feel wrong
I miss the perfume in your hair
Are you leading me on?
Would you really even care?
No

I wasn't lookin' for love
I was getting on the right track
I was about to head home
'Til you started talkin' to me like that
And now you're kissing me slow
With your hands on my back
Oh, feels like we're falling in something
Just like we used to

I was almost over you
Wasn't thinking 'bout you at all
Now it's like all I can do
Is hold on 'til the last call
Pray that you come home with me
And stay the whole night through
Maybe longer if you do
I was almost over you
You
You
I was almost over you
You

I was almost over you
Wasn't thinking 'bout you at all
Now it's like all I can do
Is hold on 'til the last call
Pray that you come home with me
And stay the whole night through
Maybe longer if you do
I was almost over you

You
You
I was almost over you
Ooh
