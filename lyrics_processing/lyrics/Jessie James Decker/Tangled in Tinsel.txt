Tangled up in tinsel with you
Lots of garland and ribbons too
I found more lights and another excuse
Just to be tangled up in tinsel with you
Walk, talk, and deck all the halls
Wrap each other up in paper and bows
I'll do whatever I gotta do
Just to be tangled up in tinsel with you

It's the time of the year
You and me and a tree
Could you come over here as fast as you can?
'Cause I sure could use your big strong hands
We'll start (We'll start) from the top (From the top)
Sipping cocoa with me and play Bing Crosby
Let's get lost in the snow glow
It's Christmas, you know, come on, let's go
'Cause I gotta get

Tangled up in tinsel with you
Lots of garland and ribbons too
I found more lights and another excuse
Just to be tangled up in tinsel with you
Walk, talk, and deck all the halls
Wrap each other up in paper and bows
I'll do whatever I gotta do
Just to be tangled up in tinsel with you

Oh no (Oh no), did you hear (Did you hear)?
There's a blizzard coming
It looks like you have to hang here
'Til the new year
You can stay, pop champagne
Won't you blow your kisses on me, yeah

Tangled up in tinsel with you
Lots of garland and ribbons too
I found more lights and another excuse
Just to be tangled up in tinsel with you
Walk, talk, and deck all the halls
Wrap each other up in paper and bows

Just to be tangled up in tinsel with you

I want you all to myself
I don't want anyone else
You make my candy cane heart melt
When I'm tangled in tinsel with you, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, oh
Tangled up in tinsel with you
Lots of garland and ribbons too
I found more lights than any excuse
Just to be tangled up in tinsel with you
Walk, talk, and deck all the halls
Wrap each other up in paper and bows (In paper and bows)
I'll do whatever I gotta do (Oh)
Just to be tangled up in tinsel with you
