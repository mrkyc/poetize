They don't make 'em like that anymore
Breaking through the mold like swinging doors
Heart of gold and a silver tongue
Dusty boots and a smoking gun
Hundred thousand miles on that old ford
If I could I'd make them all Clint Eastwood
Uh
Only talks when he's got something to say
The way he stares me down says "Make my day"
Levi vintage fashion sense
Didn't buy his jeans distressed
Barbed wire fence made him that way
Uh
If I could I'd make them all Clint Eastwood
Hey, hey, hey

We ride
Where the city lights fade to a western sky
Where an outlaw lived a little unrefined
The kind of love that takes you back in time
Every time
Hell, if I could I'd make them all
Make them all Clint Eastwood
Oh
You might also like
He don't take my rebel heart and try to fix me
But 'round the house there's always something that needs fixing
Bridges that generation gap
Wins over grandma, mom and dad
Sticks by me through the good, the bad and ugly
If I could I'd make them all Clint Eastwood
Hey, hey, hey

We ride
Where the city lights fade to a western sky
Where an outlaw lived a little unrefined
The kind of love that takes you back in time
Every time (Every time)
Hell, if I could I'd make them all
Make them all Clint Eastwood
Mmm, yeah

Go back to nineteen-sixty-seven (Come on)
Yeah, he always keeps me guessing
Little rough around the edges
Disappear into the sun set
Oh
We ride
Where the city lights fade to a western sky
Where an outlaw lived a little unrefined
The kind of love that takes you back in time
Every time
We ride (Yeah)
Where the city lights fade to a western sky
Where an outlaw lived a little unrefined
The kind of love that takes you back in time (Back in time, yeah)
Every time
Hell, if I could I'd make them all
Make them all Clint Eastwood
Oh oh, yeah
Oh, if I could I'd make them all Clint Eastwood
