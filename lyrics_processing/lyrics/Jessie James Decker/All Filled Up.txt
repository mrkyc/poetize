Don't need no high, don't need no buzz
Looking at you gets me drunk, yeah
The taste on your lips, every time does the trick
Drink you up
Put your hand up on my face
Tell me that you wanna stay (Stay)
That you can't get enough, that you feel this as much as me, babe

Don't need no wine
You got me feeling right
Don't need no fix cause you're doing it
You got more than enough, than I need in my cup

Cause I'm all filled up (Yeah, you're making me dizzy)
I'm all filled up (Don't need no white whiskey)
Yeah, I'm all filled up (You give me that good stuff, baby)
I'm all filled up
On your love, on your love, on your love, baby

Light some candles, play my jam
Take control like you're my man
When you give me that look, I feel weak and I'm hooked
Take my hand

I'm all filled up (You give me that good stuff, baby)

On your love, on your love, on your love, baby

You wet my whistle on your own
Don't need no whiskey or patron
Just a shot of you gets me gone

I'm all filled up
Hey
