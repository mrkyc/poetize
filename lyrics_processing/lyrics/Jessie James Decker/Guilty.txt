Would it bother you
To know his hands have been all over me?
And would it bother you
To know I'll run to him next time you leave?
Oh, yeah
When you hit the road
And disappear and leave me here
I'm not sure what you're doin' out there
Or who you're doin' it with
Oh, you're probably at some sweet hotel
With some groupie whore
But what the hell?
Or maybe that's just something I tell myself

When I run my nails down his back
And he kisses me on my neck
He feels me
But it kills me
Such a bittersweet passion pain
I bite my lip not to scream your name
Oh, baby
I feel everything
But guilty
You might also like
Would it bother you
To know he drinks your Southern Comfort when you're gone?
Oh, yeah, hey
And would it bother you
To know he picks up your guitar and plays your songs?
Oh, yes, he does
And I wear your band t-shirt to bed
Imagine I'm with you instead
But you're not here
No, you're never here
Oh, you're probably in the back of your bus
Satisfying your all night lust
Oh, baby
That's just something I tell myself

When I run my nails down his back
And he kisses me on my neck
He feels me
But it kills me
Such a bittersweet passion pain
I bite my lip not to scream your name
Oh, baby
I feel everything
But guilty
Would it bother you
To know he says he's in love with me?

When I run my nails down his back
And he kisses me on my neck
He feels me
But it kills me
It's a bittersweet passion pain
I bite my lip not to scream your name
Oh baby
I feel everything
But guilty

Oh-oh
