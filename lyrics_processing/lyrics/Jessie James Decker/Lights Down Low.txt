You and me were sitting in the kitchen
6 PM, should I make a reservation?
No, let's stay home
'Cause I'm good with pancakes for dinner
I'm in your t-shirt and we're playing Lynyrd Skynyrd
Oh, let's stay home

Baby, turn the lights down low
We ain't got no place to go
Turn on the stereo
Barefoot, dance with me now, dance with me now
Turn on the disco ball
Kiss me up against the wall
Laughing so hard we fall
'Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
'Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low

Run a bath and pop a little champagne
I, I love the way we celebrate
Oh, cause you know
That I'm good with watching old movies
Playing footsie, ah underneath the sheets
Oh, let's go-o-woah

Baby, turn the lights down low
We ain't got no place to go
Turn on the stereo
Barefoot, dance with me now, dance with me now
Turn on the disco ball
Kiss me up against the wall
Laughing so hard we fall
'Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
'Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low

Don't need to take me downtown
We're having this fun when no one's around
We know what happens here
When the lights go down, lights go down
The lights go down, the lights go down

Baby, turn the lights down low
We ain't got no place to go
Turn on the stereo
Barefoot, dance with me now, dance with me now
Turn on the disco ball
Kiss me up against the wall
Laughing so hard we fall
'Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
'Cause this is our night
Gonna turn all the lights down low
Take it real, take it real, take it real slow
'Cause this is our night
