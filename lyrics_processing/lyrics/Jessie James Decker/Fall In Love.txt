Oh no, don't look at me like that
And go slow, try not to move so fast
Not used to guys like you, it's too good to be true
I'm scared you won't stick like I'm sticking around
But the way you hold my hand and the way you understand
My walls come on tumbling down

Throw my hands up, baby I surrender
I'm about to fall in love
So I stand up, let's be together
I'm about to fall in love
Cause
You're the one that I want, my baby
You're the one that I want, my baby
I'm about to fall in love
Throw my hands up, now and forever
I'm about to fall in love
Yeah

You know, exactly what to say
And your lips, kissing my doubts away
It's the way you warm my bed, and the way you want me back
I've never felt so, felt so safe
You always make me smile, and the way you stay awhile
I know you're never going away
You might also like
Throw my hands up, baby I surrender
I'm about to fall in love
So I stand up, let's be together
I'm about to fall in love
Cause
You're the one that I want, my baby
You're the one that I want, my baby
I'm about to fall in love
Throw my hands up, now and forever
I'm about to fall in love

I'm on fire, he sent me like a rocket
It's so strong, I don't know how to stop it
Whatever you got, baby, I want it all

Throw my hands up, baby I surrender
I'm about to fall in love
So I stand up, let's be together (let's be together)
I'm about to fall in love
Cause
You're the one that I want, my baby (you're the one)
You're the one that I want, my baby (you're the one I want)
I'm about to fall in love
Throw my hands up, now and forever
I'm about to fall in love
