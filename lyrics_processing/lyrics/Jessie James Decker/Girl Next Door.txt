Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again in a magazine
We laughed out loud 'cause she said:
"Remember when this was all a silly dream?"
Now I wake up every day in a different city
A smile on my face, somebody pinch me
She said, "All the world's your stage"
But girl, you know those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip our tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I'll slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies, still get nervous inside
In the spotlight
Now every now and then
I miss Friday nights cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend Saturday sleepin' in late
Those were the good days

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip our tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I'll slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh

I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip our tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I'll slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends (Ooh)
We sip our tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I'll slip back into my jeans (Into my jeans)
'Cause I'm still the girl next door (Hey)
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends (Back home with my friends)
We sip our tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door (Oh)
No fancy things when I come off tour (Ooh)
I'll slip back into my jeans (Hey)
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
