Remember when we started dating
It was so intoxicating
Living wild and never bound by time
But I gotta tell you lately
We're a bit domesticated
You and me and the TV every night

Don't wanna lose, that fire with you
Let's light a fuse

Shoot out the lights while we're still young
Chase the moon till the morning comes
Let 'em say we're the crazy ones, crazy ones (crazy ones)
Let's breathe the air that we used to breathe
Back when we were seventeen
I want you looking at me like you did that night
So let's shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights

Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out

Wanna make your heart race forever
Make every moment we're together
A memory on a highlight reel
Wanna keep our energy going
Like electricity flowing
Wanna be a shock, so hot you'll feel
Don't wanna lose (don't wanna lose)
That spark with you

Shoot out the lights while we're still young
Chase the moon till the morning comes
Let 'em say we're the crazy ones, crazy ones (crazy ones)
Let's breathe the air that we used to breathe
Back when we were seventeen
I want you looking at me like you did that night
So let's shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights

Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out

Shoot out the lights while we're still young
Chase the moon till the morning comes
Let 'em say we're the crazy ones... (crazy ones, crazy ones) Yeah!
Let's breathe the air that we used to breathe
Back when we were seventeen
I want you looking at me like you did that night
So let's shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out (Yeah)
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out (Ooh)
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out (Shoot out the lights)
Shoot 'em out, shoot 'em out

So let's shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
