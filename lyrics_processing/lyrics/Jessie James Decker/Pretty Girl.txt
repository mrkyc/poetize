When I was young I would think
That nobody could ever like me
They pick me apart and call names
And made me insecure and afraid
But then I grew up and got strong
I realized I was good enough and they were wrong
Looking in the mirror I see
That this is how God wanted me to be
Don't wanna be known as, so I tell myself

You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Uh, oh yeah
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Uh, oh yeah

He used to bring me down to raise him up
Made me question how I looked and who I was
Mama didn't like him so I knew
When I finally had enough, just what to do
Look at my reflection and stare
At my body, my skin and my hair
Don't need no one to make me feel complete
All that matters is I'm beautiful to me
You don't wanna be known as, girls tell yourself

Uh, oh yeah
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Uh, oh yeah

You are beautiful
You are wonderful
You are magical
You're pretty, pretty girl
Pretty, pretty girl
