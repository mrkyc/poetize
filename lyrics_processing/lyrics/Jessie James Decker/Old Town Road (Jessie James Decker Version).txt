Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
(You can't tell me nothin')
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
(You can't tell me nothin')
You might also like
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean in like I'm Saturn
Cheated on my baby
I worry about that later
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
(You can't tell me nothin')
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
(You can't tell me nothin')

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

You can call me Daisy Dukes in my snakeskin boots
Yeah, I'm just a little Georgia peach swinging in my blue jeans
Horses in the back, one with Little Nas
Catch me ridin' dirty, watch out boys, I'm 'bout to pass
Down this old dirt road, no I can't be tamed
This ain't my first rodeo, now you're gonna know my name
Down this old dirt road, yeah, I like the chase
I'm gonna steal your heart like I'm Jessie James
Gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Oh
To the old town road
