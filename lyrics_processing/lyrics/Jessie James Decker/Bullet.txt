Alright, now
Uh-huh

My mama warned me about boys like you
It's the reason I wear these high heeled boots, yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he won't think twice, yeah

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble, better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay, you've been warned

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
Be careful what you start
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
It's gonna leave a mark
Be careful what you wish for
You get what you see
Is that a gun in your pocket
Or are you just happy to see me?
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
Be careful what you start

Well, every now and then I make a man break a sweat
Watch him work overtime on my wristbands (Yeah)
'Cause I'm the kinda girl that you wanna show off
I'll tell 'em, all your friends with a southern drawl (Yeah, yeah)

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Sweet as a peach, impossible to tame (Tame)
Fingers on the trigger and you'll be to blame (Blame)
'Cause if you stay

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
Be careful what you start
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
It's gonna leave a mark
Be careful what you wish for
You get what you see
Is that a gun in your pocket
Or are you just happy to see me?
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
Be careful what you start
Yeah, I'll ride where the wind wants to take me
Leaving lovers in the dust, every city
'Cause my heart was like a ghost town, baby
And now I met a man that brings me
My mama warned me about boys like you
It's the reason I wear these high heeled boots

I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
Be careful what you start (Be careful what you start)
I'm a bullet and I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
It's gonna leave a mark

I'm a bullet, baby
A bullet, baby (Oh yeah)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a bullet, baby
A bullet, baby (Hey)

I'm a bullet
And I'm headed
Straight for your heart (Yeah)
