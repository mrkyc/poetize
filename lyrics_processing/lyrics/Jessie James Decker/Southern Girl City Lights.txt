Ooh, that Tennessee breeze
Ain't nothing like being home
Kissing on you and iced tea
But when I've gotta leave
I take a little bit of you
And then some on the plane with me

I fly-y-y-y
Over the sky-y-y line

I'm a Southern girl (Southern girl)
In city lights (City lights)
No matter where I go, yeah (Matter where I go, yeah)
I keep my head on right (Head on right)
And those Hollywood Hills (Hollywood Hills)
And those New York nights (New York nights)
I still look up (Still look up)
With stars in my eyes (In my eyes)
Cause I'm a Southern girl (Southern girl)
In city lights, but there's no place like home
No place like home
Yeah
You might also like
Ooh, I'm looking at the moon
And know you're looking up
Thinking about me too
But hey, although I'm far away
I'm living my dream
I'll be home in a couple of days

I fly-y-y-y
Over the sky-y-y line

I'm a Southern girl (Southern girl)
In city lights (City lights)
No matter where I go, yeah (Matter where I go, yeah)
I keep my head on right (Head on right)
And those Hollywood Hills (Hollywood Hills)
And those New York nights (New York nights)
I still look up (Still look up)
With stars in my eyes (In my eyes)
Cause I'm a Southern girl (Southern girl)
In city lights, but there's no place like home
No place like home

Oh oh, you're so good to me
Oh oh, letting me live out my dream
I'm a Southern girl
In city lights
No matter where I go, yeah
I keep you on my mind
And those Hollywood Hills
And those New York nights
I still look up
With stars in my eyes
'Cause I'm a Southern girl
In city lights, but there's no place like home
No place like home

(Southern girl, city lights) Ooh ooh
(Southern girl, city lights) Ooh ooh
