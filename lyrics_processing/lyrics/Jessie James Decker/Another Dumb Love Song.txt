This might be another dumb love song
'Cause I know you've been moving on
Did you ever cut your hair, or did you keep it long?
Do you still have that guitar that we used to play on?

Yeah, I hope you're doing fine
I think of you from time to time

Does it make you feel alive?
Does it make you wanna cry?
Does the melody break your heart like it did when you broke mine?
Do you ever think of me?
When you're out there listening
On and on and on and on
Or is it just another dumb love song?
(Is it just another dumb love song?)

I heard you found somebody new
I admit, I thought it was a little soon
It was never quite right, yeah, it's something that we both knew
And I guess that's why I still sing about you

Does the melody break your heart like it did when you broke mine?
Do you ever think of me?
When you're out there listening
On and on and on and on
Or is it just another dumb love song?

(What are you doing? What are you doing?)
Is it just another dumb love song?
(What are you doing? What are you doing?)
(On and on and on)
(Is it just, is it just)
Is it just another dumb love song?
(Is it just, is it just another dumb love song?)

Yeah, I hope you're doing fine
I think of you from time to time
