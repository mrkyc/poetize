I drive
Hop in the car and head your way, midnight
I got some things I need to say, 'cause I
Can't read your mind when you don't talk to me
Baby, talk to me, talk to me

'Cause I've been patient
Don't wanna be that girl that gets all desperate

Do you love me, do you love me
Do you love me like I do?
Can you feel it, can you feel it
When my body's next to you?
Baby, just whisper in my ear
Tell me those words I need to hear
Do you love me, do you love me?
'Cause I'm standing right here

Do you? Yeah
Do you? Yeah

I know
You've been hurt, but so have I, so don't
Let it get in the way 'cause it feels so right
Let go (Let go)
'Cause what we got, it's hard to find
Let's take tonight, take tonight
