Stand and deliver!

I'm the dandy highwayman you're too scared to mention
I spend my cash on looking flash and grabbing your attention
The devil take your stereo and your record collection
The way you look, you'll qualify for next year's old-age pension

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife

I'm the dandy highwayman, so sick of easy fashion
The clumsy boots, peek-a-boo roots that people think so dashing
So what's the point of robbery when nothing is worth taking?
It's kind of tough to tell a scruff the big mistake he's making

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife
You might also like
Even though you fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
All mine


We're the dandy highwaymen, so tired of excuses
Of deep meaning philosophies where only showbiz loses
We're the dandy highwaymen and here's our invitation
Throw your safety overboard and join our insect nation!

Stand and deliver
Your money or your life
Try to use a mirror
Not a bullet or a knife

Even though you fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
All mine
