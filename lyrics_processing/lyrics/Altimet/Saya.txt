Kid Kenobi you tryna get me in trouble, man
This beat you gave me is gonna make me talk reckless
Then talk reckless it is then
Let's go!
It's SonaOne Kenobi!

Let me coupe 5 baby, RIP
Since I went solo, imma favorite rap MC
I name myself it's a self fulfilling prophecy
Still independent there's no much you can offer me
You hear what come out, when I go in
I raise the bar, no macam magic, no genie
This bars raised me no pulls up, no gym
Rap untuk rakyat, till your momma's momma know me

Saya!
I ain't really been a liar but
Everything that I put out is fire yeah
All Blacks, kalau aku kaya, tanya
Siapa rapper favorite aku? Saya (saya)

Ask why your BM is in my DM
Your salary is what I pay LHDN
What you spent in a week, cannot cover my per diem
Jual lagu melayu besok aku beli Two Door
Jual baju melayu besok-besok beli Hublot
Better rap cash please, don't wake up this cujo
You don't know me? Cium aku punya kulup
Not lying, not bragging this is the truth
You're crying when I step up in the booth
You're dying when I let this album loose
It's foul language, my pen is the golden goose

My now can be your future
If my sound becomes your tutor
My  is closed that's that Benua
So much drop like I do grab and Uber
My pennies 
All Iron Man that beats the war machines
Songs her  out
My realities' what you dream 'bout
