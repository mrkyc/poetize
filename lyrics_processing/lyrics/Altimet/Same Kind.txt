Ahh...heyyy
Ohhh

When I got you in the eye
All I see is  rainbow
 stand still baby
So let's run, run, run, run
We better fast, fast, fast
Ohh in the wonder

 2 guys of the same kind
He talks with drums and I say rhymes
Rehearsal wasn't working, it's pray time
Same jokes, what they say about great minds
Friends fight sometimes, it's the same for us
You get my  in the rainforest
Know the name,  that's our 
 98, it was so 
 the team's big but the rap speaker
My  brother from the  rivers
Couldn't believe the new  was pass sense
So now I write this in the past tense
I pray for you even though you  different talk to you
In my head, and I'm hope that you listen
I keep it moving though you can still rhythm
But the  missing
You might also like
When I got you in the eye
All I see is  rainbow
 stand still baby
So let's run, run, run, run
We better fast, fast, fast
Ohh in the wonder

Once, two brothers in the same kind
Frestylin 
City light, Friday night 
You had that medal on your hip like I ain't mine
Friends gotta beef and we play too much
I never forgive myself 
But we were young, and dumb, and 
Takes one moment to destroy all beloved create
What is worth getting top now help me grow bigger
Found my way 
Now I'm learning overseas 
I heard you hanging with the shooters  and thugs
I'm praying for you everyday and I'm sending you love
I heard they got you out the state 
My heart drop, now you facing decades in the cage
My people  hard way
All ways in my heart, man this life is strange 
Will the fake hearts 
 splitting half to 
But I'll keep you in my heart till my dying day
When I got you in the eye
All I see is  rainbow
 stand still baby
So let's run, run, run, run
We better fast, fast, fast
Ohh in the wonder

In the wonder heyy (run, run, run, run)
Just you and me (fast, fast, fast)
You and me
Ohhh in the, in the, in the, in the, in the wonder (run, run, run, run)
Ohhh in the, in the, in the, in the, in the wonder (fast, fast, fast)
Ohhh ayy ayy ohh ohh
(run, run, run, run)
(fast, fast, fast)
