Three sleepless nights
This isn't how it's supposed to be
But you're so good at taking your time
To get back to me

I will wait for you forever
If you would just ask me
I thought that I could change you
But you changed me

It doesn't feel right
Holding someone else's hand
Together on phone lines
And living at two opposite ends

It scares me to think that you could find takers
Other than me and better than me
But your head is elsewhere
And I'm talking enough for both of us
When will you see it's not (it's not) so easy for me

You're careless and whispered (I fall in your heart)
Insulting and bruising (You I trusted)
And I thought that you said (And you said)
Things were improving (Forever)
These laces are untied (Forever)
But my feet are through walking away
Away

I never thought that you could say these words
Is this really happening
I never thought that you could say these words (Don't say)
Is this really happening
I never thought that you could say these words (Don't say)
Is this really happening (that we can)
I never thought that you could say these words (Don't say)
Is this really happening (that we can still be)
I never thought that you could say these words (Don't say)
Is this really happening (that we can still be friends)

Erase my name from this page!
How can you take all these days (What is inside me, what have I done)
And throw them away (Is this the only way that you will notice me)
As I sit here waiting for you (Dead words for closed ears, all this is sung)
For you, for you!
I stay up nights (If you are still pretending this is what's right)
Until stars leave the sky (Why can't you look at me, can you only listen one side)
Knowing your mind can (Your side, can)
Take away!

Walk away from me!
