He's never gonna go away
He's never gonna go away
He's never gonna go away
He's never gonna go away
He's never gonna go away
He's never gonna go away

So we sit and we wait
For the curtains to fall
And there are words we could use
But should never say at all
But you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do

We met in the courtyard
Where no one would notice
Two kids contemplating
All high school had shown us
And I told you I loved you
And I knew you believed it
As I quieted my conscience
Hoping you didn't see it
But I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do

I just want to be with you tonight
The mood is set and we're here by candlelight
I paid my dues so don't be rude
Stop putting up a fight
I just want to get with you tonight

You know they say
What doesn't kill you
Makes you stronger
But the questions remain
Until you can't take it any longer
But I am still so young
But I didn't know I could be so dumb
And you you're still so young
But now I know that you're so dumb

He's never gonna go away
I'm never gonna go away

I just want to be with you tonight
The mood is set and we're here by candlelight
I paid my dues so don't be rude
Stop putting up a fight
I just want to, I just want to, I, I, I
I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do
So what about you?

Never satisfied
I'm never satisfied
Never satisfied
So let them all fall
Side by side

Side by side
One more will fall tonight
One more to throw aside
Bringing pain so joyfully
So you can say you have fallen
Side by side
Let them fall
Side by side
Let them fall
Side by side
Let them fall
