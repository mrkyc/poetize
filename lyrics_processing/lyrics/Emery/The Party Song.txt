Well, I know you like the party but the party never stops
I know you like the party but the party never stops
Well, I know you
I know you
I know you
I know you want to be here so you just let go
And no one's ever gonna tell you no
But I want to
'Cause I know you
I know you

But you party on
(Party on)
Get your party on
(Get your party on)

This is my last advice
Leave with me cause you could die tonight
(I got this, I got this, I got this, so go ahead home)
The drugs, you use as a place to hide
This will end bad if you don't get this right
(I got this, I got this, I got this, I don't need you)
See Emery LiveGet tickets as low as $61You might also like
You got kicked out of your mother's house
You stole money from her purse
She finally found you out
You should be ashamed
(Don't sit there judging me)
What a waste
(You'd be the same if you could see)
So lets have another drink

And we'll party on
(Party on)
Get your party on
(Get your party on)

This is my last advice
Leave with me cause you could die tonight
(I got this, I got this, I got this, so go ahead home)
The drugs, you use as a place to hide
This will end bad if you don't get this right
(I got this, I got this, I got this, I don't need you)

February is still as scary
The month your father died
A little girl in a shrieking world
Looking for her place to run and hide
Well, I know you like the party but the party never stops
I know you like the party but the party never stops
Well, I know you
I know you
I know you

But you party on
(Party on)
Get your party on
(Get your party on)
(Give it one last time cause this is all you've got!)

This is my last advice
Leave with me cause you could die tonight
(I got this, I got this, I got this, so go ahead home)
The drugs, you use as a place to hide
This will end bad if you don't get this right
