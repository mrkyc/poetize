You'll raise the daughter and she'll raise the son
You'll live like two people that wish they were one
She may not be perfect but oh, my friend, neither are you

You feel like you're waiting for somebody to
Remind you of all the things that you're supposed to do
Careful what you reach for, one more step and you're falling through

Your family's a joke and your job is your life
The time spent without them is time spent most every night
Get your house in order, cause it's gonna be a bumpy ride

(You can't stop. You can't stop the killer.)
(You can't stop. You can't stop the killer.)

I work my hands right down to the bone
Still you don't give me what I want
You are so ungrateful
We're more like a house than a home, oh
Please, dear, understand
I'm sorry again for all that I said
And how could you leave?
I swear that I'll be a better man
So go ahead and run, run
Run from the man with the gun in his hand
Darling, I would shoot you
Before I would ever let you leave
Oh, dear God

A certain place I've kept my outs

I'm shaking. I'm hollow because
I know how to get this done
So I will be the only one to follow

You kneel beside her at the foot of the grave
Your daughter is crying and you say she's in a better place
