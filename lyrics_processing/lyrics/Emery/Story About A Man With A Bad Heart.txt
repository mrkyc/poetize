Watch your makeup
There's just a smudge beneath the eye
You look great in that dress
It hits every curve just right
We're got dinner at eight, and then drinks by nine
I love you so, it's our anniversary tonight

Suddenly everything shakes as if it's starting to break
And now I'm on my knees
My wife screams, "What's Wrong!?"
As the stereo plays our song, Only In Dreams

Just last Friday is when my heart failed again
I was thinking that I should find a friend
I bought her several drinks
And slipped the ring into my hand
We drove to her place
And let the good times roll again

Suddenly everything shakes as my protection breaks
And now I'm on my knees
And I scream, "This was wrong!"
As I leave, the stereo plays the song, "The Finishing"

I'm only a man
I'm only a man

Watching this screen
These lives played out before my eyes
And how they know everything
Everything comes easy
I never had it easy
I was never lucky
It was never easy
And you sit there and you judge my commitment
You people can say that I'm the bad guy
Because I was weak
I was weak once or twice
Well let me tell you
I am standing in the need
I am standing in the need
Because I can't control this person behind my hands
(One thing I have to know, where did the miracles go?
And if a simple man believes
Will it start again with me?)
