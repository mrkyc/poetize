I used to be a better man
But the regret came, and here I am
I used to walk outside my door
But I don't go outside anymore

When will they carry me to my grave
So I can pay for the things my hands have made
Two sons will take my body and place it in the ground
And I hope they know to be nothing like me
No, nothing like me

My blood is tainted with bitterness
I want it out, I want it out of me
Oh, the taste of my inheritance
How I have fallen, the hills will cover me
You too will become weak
You too will become weak

The trees are green what happens when they turn dry
The trees are green what happens when they turn dry
We chose our words and threw them towards the sky
The trees were green, now they've all turned dry

(There was a bird
Whose wings were crushed
By a windshield
So fast to the ground
The roadside it found
As it's eyes closed
I heard the driver say
As she pulled away
"What could I have done?
The worst is over."
I thought to myself
With risk to our health
No one ever offers help
No one ever offers help
No one ever offers help
No one ever offers help)

I thought to myself
With risk to our health
No one ever offers help
When we were boys
We chased through neighbors' fields
We could run forever
And I swore to my friends
Their lives I'd defend
As a superhero
But age finds the lust
And gives it your trust
And begs your devotion in trade for discretion
The years play out as days
As those friends pass away
But you're taken care of
There's always television
