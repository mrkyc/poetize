With your mouth telling lies
And the guilt in your mind still grows
Round and round we go
You see the world in black and white
All these colors just hurt your eyes
Separate yourself from all of this
Just grit your teeth and fall in line
Repetition is the hardest part
It captures your mind but never breaks your heart
Yeah, the damage is done
When you've lost everyone
Now you've gone too far

It's a long way back to where we started
We'll find another way
Just to make you feel alive again

(The weight of all that you believed written on a paper-thin sheet)
The drug will bring you back to get your fill
(If this is it, the tragedy, I'll just hold on tightly to the doubt)
Did you ever have a doubt or second thought?
You might be wrong

Drift along with no purpose at all
We came with heavy hearts
To claim all that's ours, but empty hands are all that we found
Just to make you feel alive again
(The weight of all that you believed
Written on a paper-thin sheet)
The drug will bring you back to get your fill
(If this is it, the tragedy, I'll just hold on tightly to the doubt)
Did you ever have a doubt or second thought?
You might be wrong
(You might be wrong)
You might be wrong

You're blaming all my waywardness on cigarettes and booze
But I can't walk a straight line without a drink or two
And your expectations always wear me out
If I was a younger man, I'd slap those words
Right back into your mouth
Well if this is "found" then I'd rather be "lost"
I was born a broken man, and that's how I will end it all
The words come, your back turns, it's the last I see your face
Maybe it's just better that way
You're the "hurting", you're the "broken"
You're the one "in need of grace"
You're the "called-out", you're the "beckoned"
But your feet can't pull away
From the place that you've been planted in the ground
