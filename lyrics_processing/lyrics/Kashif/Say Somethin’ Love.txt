Do you agree with me
That everything's OK
With me, do you wanna stay
I don't wanna make it seem like
I'm tryin' to rule over you
If anything is on your mind
Just let me hear your point of view
Say somethin' love (Just talk it out, just talk it out)
Do you agree with me
That everything's OK
With me, do you wanna stay
Hold my hand
Fly me to the land of never passing lust
Of everlasting love
Don't just stand there baby
Flashin' your purty eyes
Now did I leave out anything
Are there any ands, buts, or whys
I wanna stay with you
We should be together
