I like workin' in the dark
When I can get down and nobody can see how I get down
Cause then they try to copy how you get down
And they they wanna turn it around and say "I get down like this, Kashif doesn't get down like this, but I get down like this"
But you know I take the best of both worlds, I take it with a grain of salt, and I say "To heck with it"

Have you heard the latest word
I'm supposed to be disturbed
It's just a rumor
Just the other night
Someone said I lost my mind
Those crazy rumors

Talk 'bout me
All the time
They don't know
What's on my mind
Girl you haunt
Me every night
Those dreams of you
And swee desire
You might also like
Rumors of love
Tell 'em that it's true
That it's really me and you
Rumors, this love
Tell 'em that it's us
That it's really us in love
Rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor

Do you have a crush on me
Is it true, or could it be
Is it a rumor
It's not fair for them to spread
Things they make up in their head
Those crazy rumors

I live in fear
The walls have ears
They repeat
Just what they hear
The jezebels
They kiss and tell
Kind of tricks
I know too well
Rumors of love
Tell 'em that it's true
That it's really me and you
Rumors, this love
Tell 'em that it's us
That it's really us in love
Rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor
Rumors of love, baby
Tell 'em that it's true
It's really me and you
Rumors, this love
Tell those jezebels
That they can go to hell
Rumors of love, baby
Tell 'em that it's true
That it's really me and you
Rumors, this love
Baby tell 'em that it's true
It's really me and you
Rumors of love, baby
Tell 'em that it's true
That it's really me and you
Rumors, this love
Tell 'em that it's true
That it's really me and you
Rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor

Rumors of love
Tell 'em that it's true
It's really me and you
No more rumors, this love
Tell 'em that it's true
That it's really me and you
No more rumors
Rumors, rumors rumors rumors
