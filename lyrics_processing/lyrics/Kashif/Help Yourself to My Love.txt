Mmm, baby

Pressure is risin'
Girl you got me hongry for your love
So hypnotizin'
Your love has taken over me
Don't waste a moment more
Oh, if you want me

And come over here

Help yourself to my love
Don't hold back your love on me, baby
Have your way with my love
Girl release your love on me

Girl you're too much
Killin' me gently with your love
