Hot and sticky for the next three days
Summertime is here
You love a bed of a pick up full of beer and ice
You've got a F150 cooler with four wheel drive
Dancin' on flat beds, parked side by side
Gas powered generator, some portable lights
Playin' electric guitar, eatin' barbecue
Got your baby right next to you, you
You've got yourself a party
A smokin' rockin' redneck rave
A hillbilly binder kickin' off the weekend
The right way
It's gonna go all night
They'll be some skinny dippin' down at the lake
We'll get out in the country
We're gonna rock and roll in the hay
The hay, hay, hay
You get your tents and trailers
Motorcycles and trucks
Bonfire in the middle
And we'll circle up
You might also likeYeah, it's gonna get hotter
Than it's been in a while
Better have a Hi-8 camera
Case some girls get wild
Slipping off, out behind the barn
Yeah, we know what's goin' on
You've got yourself a party
A smokin' rockin' redneck rave
A hillbilly binder kickin' off the weekend
The right way
It's gonna go all night
They'll be some skinny dippin' down at the lake
We gettin' out in the country
We're gonna rock and roll in the hay
The hay, hay, hay
Yeah, we've got ourselves a party
A smokin' rockin' redneck rave
A hillbilly binder kickin' off the weekend
The right way
It's gonna go all night
They'll be some skinny dippin' down at the lake
