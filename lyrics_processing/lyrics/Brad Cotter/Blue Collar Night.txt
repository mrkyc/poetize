This American dream ain't easy on a paycheck twice a month
SSI FICA fedral and state tax, only thing it's good for is settin' a man back
But I've got a 20 in my pocket and I'm gettin' the first round
And there's a band in the corner and they're gonna rock the house
And them girls from the Skynard show, how much you wanna bet
There all ready in the back shootin' pool and smokin' cigarettes
And we might get lucky, if we play our cards right
Chances are I'll end up drunk just trying to pick a fight
Singing Whoa all the way home.. Yeah we'll shoot out the lights
Its a Blue Collar Night
I'm still in that same red brick flat me and Gina hunted down
Cinder block shevles and the lime green sofa pull out
Been two years since I've seen her leave in that corvette
When I look around this dump sometimes I see why she left
But I've been savin' up my money, started goin' back to school
And I'm learning them computers and maybe in a year or two
I can start a little buisness and if I get it off the ground
I can talk the bank into a loan for that place Gina dreamed about
And I bet she'll come crawling back, I'll be sittin' here till then
Drinkin' beer and throwin' darts and having laughs with all my friends
Singing whoa all the why home. yeah we'll shoot out the lights, it's a blue collar night
Yeah
You might also likeI came home to Gina's sweet voice coming out of my machine
Said that LA sunshine is even better than I dreamed
I rewound 3 more times, called my steve
I said lets go, he said I'm broke, I said grab your keys
Cause I've got a 20 in my pocket and I'm gettin' the first round
And there's a band in the corner, they're gonna rock the house
And those girls from the Skynard show, how much you wanna bet
They're already in the back shootin' pool and smokin' cigarettes
Yeah we might get lucky if we play our cards right
But chances are we'll end up drunk just trying to pick a fight
Singing Whoooo all the way home
Yeah we'll shoot out the lights
Its a Blue Collar Night
Whooo all the way home
Yeah we'll shoot out the lights
