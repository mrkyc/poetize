And here in the night as I feel the inferno
I stare in the dark thinking what is eternal
The man or the moment, the act or the reason
These thoughts fill my head as I contemplate treason
Of dreams I have had and dreams I have pondered
When late in the night, my mind it would wander
To things I have done and then quickly regretted
While denying vices my life had selected

And I think what I've done
Or have yet to begin
And the man I've become
And the man that I've been
Now caught in a waltz
With the eternal dancer
I'm courted by death
But death isn't the answer, I say

All I was meant to be
Could I suddenly just decide
Not a thought would survive
Could it be my life's worth
Ended there with my birth?
You might also like
If I could see someone
Who's been there before me
And traded his soul for a moment of glory
His penance or mercy by spirits debated
While judged on a scale that's been heavily weighted

And what have I done
Could there be such a sin
In this man I've become
In this man that I've been
Now calling to god
From the pit's very bottom
I pray he forgives
Every sin I've forgotten this day


And who would have thought that my fate it would conjure
This twist in the road on which I have wandered
Each vision and dream now completely dismembered
To give one's whole life and find nothing's remembered

And what good is a life
That leaves nothing behind?
Not a thought or a dream
That might echo in time
The years and the hours
The seconds and minutes
And everything that
My life has placed in it
Betrayed
Betrayed
Betrayed
The things I have done
The places I've been
The cost of my dreams
The weight of my sins
And everything that I've gathered in life
Could it be lost?
Could it be lost in this
Could it be lost in this
Could it be lost in this
