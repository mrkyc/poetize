O Holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear savior's birth

Now you all heard the story about Bethlehem
How the child was born and the three wise men
Heard the preacher tell it like the preacher does
But let me tell you, children
That's not how it was

Now you might ask me what I'm talking about
But I know the part that they all left out
Yes, I do
Now do you hear what I said
That Herod wanted those wise men dead
But on that blessed evening
My great great great great great great granddad
He saved those kings

Now granddad made his living
Playing jazz you see
But jazz wasn't big around 1 AD
So he got himself a job in the palace band
Where he heard about three kings
In the desert sand
You might also like
Let me tell you children that at any time
Three kings in the desert, that's a real rare find
Yes, it is
But Herod heard of it too
And when he heard, his curiosity grew
So he asked those kings to drop by
And my great great great great great great granddad
He wondered why

So the Magi told old Herod
That they had come here
To find a newborn king of kings
Who'd heal our sins
Then old Herod told his guards
To follow those Magi
And that the only king around here
Was gonna be him

Then he told his soldiers as I recall
When they found that child, to kill them all
But granddad overheard what Herod said
And he had to act fast or else they'd all be dead
Yes, they would
So granddad got to those kings
Filled them in on the plan, told them everything
When they heard what he had in store
They grabbed the gold, the frankincense
The myrrh, the jewels, the desert tents
And when they found, his plan was sound
They followed granddad out the back door
Yes, they did
They followed him down

And what a night
It must have been
But when God is on your side
You kinda' know that in the end
You're gonna win
They traveled fast
They traveled far
But in the end they found
That they were standing with the Child
Beneath the star yeah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
And so you see
We've reached the end of our story
When granddad and the kings
Reached that stable on the hill
And while I said that three kings in the desert's a rare sight
Angels singing in the desert, that's far rarer still

Now I ain't sayin' that the Bible was wrong
But ya' see the whole tale
Would have taken too long
'Cause way back then in the promised land
Every copy they sold
It had to be written by hand
All by hand
And granddad lived a long life
Stayed friends with those kings
And found a good wife
And eventually I came along
But that, my children
That, my children
