Remember last Christmas Eve
When we sat next to our first tree
Ornaments reflected light
Of a candle in the night
And I gave you a music box
Back then that seemed like so much
We watched it go round and round
As the melodies unwound
But all these things are now long gone
And not to be wished upon again

But the music box continues to turn
The candle in the window continues to burn
But I know they're just memories
Like Christmas past and you and me

Remember that old fireplace
That held the room in warm embrace
And as we watched for Christmas ghosts
The fire held the shadows close
But now upon that Christmas scene
The candle wax of melted dreams
And ornaments of shattered glass
Now belonging to the past
All these things now long gone
And not to be wished upon again
You might also like
But the music box continues to turn
The candle in the window continues to burn
But I know they're just memories
Like Christmas past and you and me

I miss you baby
Oh yes, I do
And it's been far too long yeah
Since I last laid eyes on you

I got the lights upon the Christmas tree
I got the candle lit for you to see
And beside this window I will wait
For inside this night it's not too late
(I got the lights up on the tree) The candles burning
(I got the candle lit for you to see) You know I'm gonna wait
(And beside this window I will wait) The clock keeps turning
(For inside this night it's not too late) But I know it's not, I know it's not too late


I got the lights upon the Christmas tree
I got the candle lit for you to see
And beside this window I will wait
For inside this night
