Who is this child that I've never seen before?
Who is this child that I've not seen 'til this day?
Who dares to fall asleep outside my door?
If we should wait awhile I'm sure she'll go away
To be involved with this would surely not be wise
For in the final word she means nothing to me
I learned the trick is that we just avoid her eyes
And the question, what she means to

What is this life?
There will be other lives
Soon to arrive
Surely some will survive
She is but one
And there are many more
Each the same as any other
Who is this child?
What does she mean to me?
I close my eyes
And still her face I see
She is but one
Her kind is everywhere
Can't you see there's no way I should care?
You might also like
I need a moment now I have to clear my mind
Is there a limit, Lord just to being kind
There is no way in life that each child can be saved
Should I be looking with regret at every grave?
There are no guarantees in life she should be warned
I'm not responsible for this child being born
I'm not responsible in any kind of way
For every child that life can gather

What is this life?
There will be other lives
Soon to arrive
Surely some will survive
She is but one
And there are many more
Could this one life really matter?
Who is this child?
What does she mean to me?
I close my eyes
And still her face I see
She is but one
Her kind is everywhere
Can't you see there's no way I should care?
Can you see it in the night
Can you feel that it's out there?
It's the arcing of a life
And it's hanging in the air
Though I try to close my eyes
And pretend that I don't know
In my heart I just can't let it go
There has to be another way for me
A way that leads from this insanity
A way that leads from my destruction as I say
Can you see it in the night
Can you feel that it's out there
It's the arcing of a life
And it's hanging in the air
Though I try to close my eyes
And pretend that I don't know
In my heart
