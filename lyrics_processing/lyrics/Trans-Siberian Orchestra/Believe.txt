So after all those one night stands
You've ended up with heart in hand
A child alone on your own
Retreating
Regretful for the things you're not
And all the things you haven't got
Without a home
A heart of stone lies bleeding

And for all the roads you followed
And for all you did not find
And for all the dreams you had to leave behind

I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark I hear your screams
Don't turn away
Just take my hand
And when you make your final stand
I'll be right there
I'll never leave
And all I ask of you's
Believe
You might also like
Your childhood eyes were so intense
While bartering your innocence
For bits of string
The grown-up wings you needed
But when you had to add them up
You found that they were not enough
To get you in
And pay for sins
Repeated

And for all the years you borrowed
And for all the tears you hide
And for all the fears you had to keep inside

I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark I hear your screams
Don't turn away
Just take my hand
And when you make your final stand
I'll be right there
I'll never leave
And all I ask of you's
Believe
Yeah
I never wanted to know
Never wanted to see
I wasted my time
'Til time wasted me
Never wanted to go
Always wanted to stay
'Cause the person I am
Are the parts that I play
So I plot and I plan
Hope and I scheme
To the lure of a night
Filled with unfinished dreams
And I'm holding on tight
To a world gone astray
As they charge me for years
I can't pay
Yeah


I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark I hear your screams
Don't turn away
Just take my hand
And when you make your final stand
I'll be right there
I'll never leave
And all I ask of you's
