There in this night
There is a life
Someone who waits for me
Only a child
Dreams and a smile
Waiting to play
And now she's found
Snow on the ground
Magic has been set free
She's waited here
All of this year
Just for this day

And then the night comes alive
With lights to dazzle
And everything's extraordinary
Nothing is left ordinary

Christmas has come
With its long memory
And in my mind
It always will be
The world that she sees
You might also like
Caught in this night pieces of light
Glitter and play for you
And made of glass dreams from the past
Wait for this day
And if you try look in the sky
One star is shining through
And on this eve you can't believe
It's far away

And then the night comes alive
With lights to dazzle
And everything's extraordinary
Nothing is left ordinary

Christmas has come
With its long memory
And in my mind
It always will be
The world that she sees

There on this night
Pieces of light
There on this night
Pieces of light
Christmas has come
Christmas has come
The world that she sees
The world that she sees
On this night
On this night
The world that she sees
Then after he had thought awhile
The father recalled another child
Born in a time now far away
And how this child's dreams
Had reached this day
He wondered what that child had thought
And when he slept what dreams he sought
And did the shepherds understand
All the hopes in that child's hands?
And how those hopes would still survive
As dreams within each newborn's eyes
* * *
Then the child heard a clock tolling
From a distant city tower
And she gazed up at the starlight
On this Christmas midnight hour
And she wondered if these stars
Were all but bits of dreams
From somewhere in the distant past
That somehow, could still be seen
And she wondered if her candle
Upon this magic night
Could be seen by someone faraway
