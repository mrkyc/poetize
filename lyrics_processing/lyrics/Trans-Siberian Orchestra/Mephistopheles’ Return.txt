In every life it has been said
There comes a time to join the dead
Admit there is no second chance
And join death in a final dance
Across the floor, eternity
Until the final moment's bled
And in the dark, to take his hand
Accept that it is time to wed

I don't know what I'm thinking
Because all that I see
Is his face, grinning
Mephistopheles
I need to find an answer
For this one cannot be
Within the words of
Mephistophel

Tell me what you think
Tell me what you know
Did you really think
That there would be an ever after?
Do you think I'm scared?
Tell me does it show?
When inside this deafness
I can always hear his whispering?
You might also like
There comes a time you decide
What from your life will be real
What scars you will keep alive
What you are willing to heal
But can I gamble this night
With everything that I am?
And can I erase my life?
Or do I stay here and be?

Tell me what you think
Tell me what you know
Did you really think
That there would be an ever after?
Do you think I'm scared?
Tell me does it show?
When inside this deafness
I can always hear his laughter

I don't know what I'm thinking
Because all that I see
Is his face grinning
Mephistopheles
I need to find an answer
For this one cannot be
Within the words of Mephistopheles
Don't need this path before me
Don't need forgotten glory
Don't need these threats of violence
Don't need eternal silence
Don't need these midnight visions
Don't need to make decisions
Don't need to be uncertain
Don't need this final curtain
Somewhere out there (Don't need this path before me)
He still gazes (Don't need forgotten glory)
As I wander (Don't need these threats of violence)
Through these mazes (Don't need eternal silence)
Death and life here (Don't need these midnight visions)
Truth or lies (Don't need to make decisions)
Every thought is (Don't need to be uncertain)
Well disguised (Don't need this final curtain)
Now (Somewhere out there) (Don't need this path before me)
It is too late (He still gazes) (Don't need forgotten glory)
This path to take (As I wander) (Don't need these threats of violence)
Don't want to lose my life this way (Through these mazes) (Don't need eternal silence)
Medusa dreams (Death and life here) (Don't need these midnight visions)
The dead still scream (Truth or lies) (Don't need to make decisions)
Don't want to (Every thought is) (Don't need to be uncertain)
See my life betrayed (Well disguised) (Don't need this final curtain)
All these things are now before me (Now) (Somewhere out there)
Endless death or timeless glory (It is too late) (He still gazes)
On this night of ghosts returning (This path to take) (As I wander)
To the light of bridges burning (Don't want to lose my life this way) (Through these mazes)
All these things are now before me (Medusa dreams) (Death and life here)
Endless death or timeless glory (The dead still scream) (Truth or lies)
On this night of ghosts returning (Don't want to) (Every thought is)
To the light of bridges burning (See my life betrayed) (Well disguised)
Now it is too late
This path to take
Don't want to see my life be
Tell me what you think
Tell me what you know
Did you really think
That there would be an ever after?
Do you think I'm scared?
Tell me does it show?
When inside this deafness
I can always hear his laughter

I don't know what I'm thinking
Because all that I see
Is his face grinning
Mephistopheles
I need to find an answer
For this one cannot be
Within the words of Mephistopheles

The cost of patience
When there's no time before me
Of hesitation
All for this twisted glory
And my salvation
The cost of how it's gotten
The cost of what's gained
