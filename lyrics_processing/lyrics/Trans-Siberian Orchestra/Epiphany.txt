England

Don't go
Does it have to be this way?
Can't we have just one more chance?
Those who know, they will not say
Must this be the final
Dance in our lives?
As time just moves on
Yesterday's years
Are too quickly gone
All visions fade
As worlds fall apart
Decisions are made
But there in this dark now
There in this dark now
Somewhere on this night
A life is out there
And can someone tell me how

Here on this night
So far away
Bits of starlight
Fall where they may
I never wanted to go
I never wanted to stay
I never wanted to be afraid
But still
Childhood sees what childhood will
But nothing ever stays the same
I fear the night
I fear the dark
I need this light
That distant spark
I know that

Somewhere
Someone's looking to deceive and
Somewhere
Young men die and children bleed and
Somewhere
Some have too much while others need and
Somewhere
Someone's looking to believe and

Somewhere
Somewhere
Somewhere
Somewhere

And the night and the dark
And the hopes and the dreams
As we all play our parts
While ignoring the screams
So we lie to ourselves
And we just carry on
Never stop, never turn
Don't admit what is
Gone in to this twisted story
All these things so clear before me
Every path we've ever taken
Can't admit we were mistaken
In this night of my devising
Never live and never dying
Each escape I've never taken
Never dream and never waken
Somewhere
Someone's looking to deceive and
Somewhere
Young men die and children bleed and
Somewhere
Some have too much while others need and
Somewhere
Someone's looking to believe and


Come one come all
Welcome to the world's greatest entertainment since the fall of rome
Life, death, victims, voyeurs
The best of society, the lowest of plebeians
And to keep it all extremely interesting, today's patrons
Could very easily be tomorrow's entertainment
All compliments of the ultimate showman, Fate
All that's missing is the Coliseum


Did you ever walk up
To the edge of a cliff?
Stare into the abyss
As your mind wonders if
You should take one more step
Further into that night?
Well your mind says you won't
But your heart says you might
Would you fall through the dark
Feel the wind in your hair?
Would you embrace the ground
And end your life right there?
Or would god reach his hand
And that moment you fly?
Or if he chanced to blink
And then, that moment you die
You die, you die, you die, you die, you die, you die, you die
Stare into the dark
As the abyss keeps calling
Try to take a step
But then the mind keeps stalling
Can a single question
Just go on forever?
As a single thought goes on
It's now or never
Stare into the dark
As the abyss keeps calling
Try to take a step
But then the mind keeps stalling
Can a single question
Just go on forever?
As a single thought goes on
It's now or never
Never really took much
Never really had to
Only had a small crush
Problem was that it grew
Never really took much
Never really had to
Only had a small crush
Problem was that it grew

Be who you are
What you were, what they see
From eternity's view
Tell me which one is me?
Can you be who you are?
What you were, What they see?
From eternity's view
Tell me which one is me?
On this night keep me close
On this night breathe my air
On this night hold me tight
Feel my heart beating there
On this night keep me close
On this night breathe my air
On this night hold me tight
Feel my heart beating there
On this night keep me close
On this night breathe my air
On this night hold me tight
Feel my heart beating there


Did you ever walk up
To the edge of a cliff?
Stare into the abyss
As your mind wonders if
You should take one more step
Further into that night?
Well your mind says you won't
But then this all is your life
Your life, your life
This all is your life
Your life, your life
This all is your life
Your life, your life
This all is your

Is your life
Is your life
Is your life
