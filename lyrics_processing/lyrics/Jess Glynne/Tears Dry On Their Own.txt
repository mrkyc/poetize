And this deep regret I had to get accustomed to
Once it felt so right as if a place was not as high
Lived and waited in the hotel room late at night
I knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I let myself get so attached
It's my responsibility and you don't owe nothing to me
But to let myself walk, I have no capacity
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own
I don't understand, why do I stress the man
When there's so many better things than him at hand
We could have never had it all, we had to hit a wall
And this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you, a perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again, I shoulda be my own best friend
Not f*ck myself in the head with stupid men
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own

And as we kiss goodbye the sun begins to set
So we are history, your shadow covers me
The sky above, a blaze that only lovers see
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I am gone
Baby in your way in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own
In your way in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own
In your way in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own
In your way in this cool shade
