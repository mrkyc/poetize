I'd give you all my money
If love was the currency
If my back was up against it
I'd swear on my property
I know you ain't the one to gamble
I bet you you're gonna win
Lay all your cards on the table
Let me know if you're out or in

If you give a little time then I'll be yours (Ooh)
Just spend a little time 'cause it don't cost (Ooh)

One, two, three, add it up
You plus me, that's enough
Put it all down on a good thing
Don't you wanna know what you're missing?
One, two, three, add it up
What I need ain't a lot
Put it all down on a good thing
Don't you wanna know what you're missing?

Put a little love on me
A little love down on me
Won't you put it down on me
Put a little lovin' down on me
