Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Swimming in the deep end
With nowhere to go
My body's on a journey
And my mind can't let go
I'm falling into nothing
Tell me what's left to lose
Thought I knew where I was going
But now I know I need you

They say you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone
They say you're no one
'Til someone misses you when you're gone
And now I feel like I've let you down
It's me now who's reaching out
I can't do this on my own
Because you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone

When I hit the ground running (Mmm)
Trying not to give in (Mmm)
Every step is a hurdle (Mmm)
Don't know where I begin (Mmm)
Holding my arms wide open (Mmm)
When lonely is the truth (Mmm)
Thought I knew where I was going
But now I know I need you

Oh, oh
If I came home and it all crashed down
Oh, oh
If I had no one else around
Oh, oh
Would you be there to pull me out?
Oh, oh
Could I be that somebody to you?
(Please tell, please tell me now)
Will I be that somebody to you?
(Please tell, please tell me now)
Will I be that somebody to you?
To you, to you, to you, to you
