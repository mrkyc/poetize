I always say what I'm feeling
I, I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out

Yeah, I like my coffee with two sugars in it
Nike shoes and my hoodie fitted
Always have my hair tied up (Hey, hey, hey)
Insecure, but I won't admit it
Many things that I could get rid of
Don't know how to give it up

I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
Momma always said "Girl, you're trouble"
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me?
And every time we touch, oh, you make me feel weak
Hey, I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me?
(A woman)

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (A woman)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me

Baby, just be mine for the weekend
And we can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Oh, we could just go out for the evening
Hopefully end up with you kissing me now, hey, hey

You got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
My hair with your fingers in it
Love it when you turn me on (Hey, hey, hey)
Punk funk with a little bit of
"Love Drunk" in the middle with it
Get down to our favorite song

I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
Momma always said "Girl, you're trouble"
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me?
And every time we touch, oh, you make me feel weak
Hey, I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers

Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (A woman)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me
I've been sittin' here, waitin'
I've been waitin' on you
I've been sittin' here, waitin'
On and on and on and on

Woman like me, like a woman like me (Oh, yeah)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (A woman)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (Like a woman like me)
La-la-la, woman like me, like a woman like me (Like a woman like me)
