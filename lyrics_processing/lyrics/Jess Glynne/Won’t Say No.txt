Tell me, can you keep a secret?
If you're hiding then I'll seek it
'Cause I wanna get closer, I wanna get close to you
If I speak a little louder
Don't say nothing, don't say nada
'Cause I wanna get closer, I wanna get close

All day, you've got me always
Even when I'm away
All you ever have to do is ask
All day, you've got me always
Even when I'm away
All you ever have to do is ask

I won't say no
I won't say no
I won't say nothing, I'll just give it all to you
I won't say no-oh-oh
I won't say no-oh-oh
And everything I have, I give it all to you

I don't need no rhyme or reason
To protect the way I'm feeling
'Cause I wanna get closer, I wanna get close to you
If it's gonna cause problems
Don't worry, we can solve 'em
'Cause I wanna get closer, I wanna get close
