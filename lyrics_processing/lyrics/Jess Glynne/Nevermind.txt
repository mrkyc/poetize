Nevermind tomorrow
Nevermind the fall
Nevermind the worry
If I'm standing next to you
I held you in the morning
And I kiss you late at night
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind
Who is wrong or right

You said I'm lazy
And I was giving up on us
But how can you blame me
If I wasn't enough?

I never minded when your heart turned dark
With every fight I loved you just as hard
And I tried to stop you overthinking
And I gave you my word from the start
That I never minded all your broken parts

Look at all our history
And there's no going back
Remember what you gave me
And now I'm done with being mad
You pushed me and I pulled you back
Too far, we came off the tracks
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind
It all don't matter now

You think I'm lazy
And I was giving up on us
But darling can you blame me
If we ran out of love?

Said I never minded when your heart turned dark
With every fight I loved you just as hard
And I tried to stop you overthinking
And I gave you my word from the start
But I never minded all your broken parts

Every time you said you were breaking
I'm laying right by your side
Every time your guns were blazing, ohhh
Every time you said you hate me
I lay right by your side
Every time your emotions faze me
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind

I never minded when your heart turned dark
With every fight I loved you just as hard (Just as hard)
And I tried to stop you overthinking
And I gave you my word from the start (Give you my word)
