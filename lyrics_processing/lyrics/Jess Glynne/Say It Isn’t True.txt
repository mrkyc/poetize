Walls are cavin' in and hauntin' me
Hidin' from myself between these sheets
Now I'm starin' at my reflection
Losin' all of my affection for me
Holdin' on to moments that make sense
Had way too many run-ins, feelings spent
What doesn't kill you always hurts you
But that don't mean we deserve to feel this way

So don't tell me nothin', tell me somethin'
Say it isn't true
Felt lonely lately, so deflated
Words are misconstrued
My time's been wasted, I've been breakin'
Not because of you
So don't tell me nothin', be my somethin'
Help me see this through

Say it isn't true, ooh, yeah
Say it isn't true

I know I've been actin' dumb, so set me straight (Mm)
You're the only one who'll say it to my face
I'm so over feelin' numb
Just wanna leave this shit behind and be me
Never thought I'd have someone
Someone like you
Just one word, babe
Just you, oh

Felt lonely lately, so deflated

Darling, just hold me now
What if it all falls down?
Let's just pretend for now and see

So just tell me nothin', tell me somethin'
Say it isn't true
Felt lonely lately, so deflated
Words are misconstrued (Ooh, whoa)
My time's been wasted, I've been breakin'
Not because of you

Say it isn't true, ooh
Say it isn't, say it isn't true
