Yesterday I felt like I was burning
Started wishing for tomorrow
'Cause I knew I couldn't face the early morning
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
The saddest thing of all I can't control it
I don't want to feel this pain
Just want to throw it all away and not forget it
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

Sorrow's here and never leaves
That's another part of me
Better deal with it
Can't be afraid of it, no

I draw these tears from my eyes
Just so I could stop the pain
I lay in bed, playing dead
Just so I could start again
Because I loved you, now I hate you
Gave my all to be the best
But you let me go to waste
Now every time I see your face
I know I'm bound to break again
Because I loved you, now I hate you, and I can't hurt you
Now I loved you, now I hate you, and I can't hurt you

I thought that this was part of being happy
That being numb and sharing tears
Was what everybody did without a worry
Ohh-ohh-ohh, ohh
I held on far too long on feeling nothing
Thinking time will pass and these moments
Tend to last and I'll be happy
Ohh-ohh-ohh, ohh, hey

Sorrow's here and never leaves
That's another part of me
But I deal with it
Can't be afraid of it, no

I draw these tears from my eyes
Just so I could stop the pain
I lay in bed, playing dead
Just so I could start again
Because I loved you, now I hate you
I gave my all to be the best
But you let me go to waste
Now every time I see your face
I know I'm bound to break again
Because I loved you, now I hate you, and I can't hurt you
Because I loved you, now I hate you, and I can't hurt you
And I can keep these silly little lies
'Cause I'm not being loyal to me
And I can't keep on standing in disguise
'Cause I'm not being true to me, ohh

And I draw these tears from my eyes
Just so I could stop the pain
I lay in bed, playing dead
Just so I could start again
Because I loved you, now I hate you
I gave my all to be the best
But you let me go to waste
Now every time I see your face
I know I'm bound to break again
Because I loved you, now I hate you, and I can't hurt you

I draw these tears from my eyes
Just so I could stop the pain
I lay in bed, playing dead
Just so I could start again
Because I loved you, now I hate you
And I can't hurt you, 'cause I love you
You know I love you
