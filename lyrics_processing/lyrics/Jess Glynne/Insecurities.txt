I've stretched myself too thin
Tried to be everything
Don't know how to love
I care way too much
I need a thicker skin
To let nobody in
Don't know how to guard
My tears and my loss

Dark nights the silence eats me up, but
Day comes and everything's enough

I'm free, but I'm fragile, I'm happy, but I'm worried
I'm set up, but I'm so afraid
I get pins and needles when I think about it
It catches me every day
I've got scars on my soul that I'm scared to show
I cried in the morning, but you'd never know
I should let it be, it's just my insecurities
I should let it be, it's just my insecurities

I tried to raise my voice
Get clouded by the noise
Tripped up more than twice
Those fools taught me right
I bared my naked soul
All of my painful flaws
Wish I could open up
Take in the love

Dark nights the silence eats me up, but
Day comes and everything's enough, oh

I'm free, but I'm fragile, I'm happy, but I'm worried
I'm set up, but I'm so afraid
I get pins and needles when I think about it
It catches me every day
I've got scars on my soul that I'm scared to show
I cried in the morning, but you'd never know
I should let it be, it's just my insecurities
I should let it be, it's just my insecurities

Every freckle on my skin has a reason
Every scar that I have was worth bleeding
Every curl on my head is a treasure
(I think about it, I don't wanna lie, can't find it, ooh)

I'm free, but I'm fragile, I'm happy, but I'm worried
Set up, but I'm so afraid
I get pins and needles when I think about it
It catches me every day
I've got scars on my soul that I'm scared to show
I cried in the morning, but you'd never know
I should let it be, it's just my insecurities
I should let it be, it's just my insecurities
