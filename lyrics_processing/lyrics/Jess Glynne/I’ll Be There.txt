When all the tears are rolling down your face
And it feels like yours was the only heart to break
When you come back home and all the lights are out
And you're getting used to no one else being around

Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you

When it's Friday night and the drink don't work the same
And you're alone with yourself and there's no one else to blame
When you still can't feel the rhythm of your heart
And you see your spirit fading in the dark

Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
