Ooh...

Every butterfly I get belongs to you
You don't believe me, but it's true
Sure, the freckles on my arm spell out your name
Real feelings coming through
'Cause all I know and all I am is you, ooh
Yeah, all I know and all I am is you, ooh

I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it
That all I know and all I am is you

Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause all I am is you

Ooh
Ooh (Oh)

(Hey!)
Every daydream I have starts and ends with you (Hey!)
I wanna play it one more time (Hey!)
When I need an alibi, you're my perfect excuse (Hey!)
You are always on my side

'Cause all I know and all I am is you, ooh

I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it (Oh, no)
That all I know and all I am is you

Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
All I am is you

It feels like I'm miles away
You bring me back home again
You hold me through my mistakes
Let go as we start again
You're a habit I'll never break
No-no, no-no, no, ooh!
I'm breaking my silence
'Cause I've had a few
I just can't deny it (Oh, no)
That all I know and all I am is you (Oh woah)

Every time I think I'm falling
I know you're falling too
There's no doubt you're all in (Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah)
If you ever think you're falling
You know I'll catch you too (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
All I am is you

'Cause all I know and all I am is you (Ooh)
Yeah, all I know and all I am is you (Ooh)
'Cause all I know and all I am is you (Ooh)
