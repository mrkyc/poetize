You're giving me right, You're giving me wrong
You're selling me something that I'll never own
You're giving me hope, You're leaving me cold
You're telling me nothing, I don't already know
You taught me to gamble, and told me we'd win
So I took all I had, and I put in all in
My heart is here freezing, as my tears fill my bowl
And I'm finally tasting alone

This is the saddest vanilla that I've ever tasted
The saddest vanilla and I don't wanna waste it
Sat at an ice cream parlour
You went and broke my heart yeah
Now I'm the saddest vanilla

You're giving me light, you're giving me dark
You told me the ending, right at the start
You're giving me something I shouldn't get used to
You're giving me blackout, you're giving me see-through
You tease me with heaven, you're giving me hell
You started running the moment I fell
My heart is here freezing
As my tears fill the bowl
And I'm finally tasting alone

I thought you could be gentle
Wrapping round, round and down
You're fucking with my mental
I used to love the taste of it
Until you went and poisoned it
And now

This is the saddest vanilla that I've ever tasted
The saddest vanilla but I don't wanna waste it

Sat at an ice cream parlour
You went and broke my heart yeah
