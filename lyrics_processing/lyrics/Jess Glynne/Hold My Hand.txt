Standing in a crowded room, and I can't see your face
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
In my mind, I'm running 'round a cold and empty space
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Break my bones, but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh

Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
'Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand?
Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand

Soul is like a melting pot when you're not next to me
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tryna find a moment where I can find release (Find release)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Please tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
(Leave, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
