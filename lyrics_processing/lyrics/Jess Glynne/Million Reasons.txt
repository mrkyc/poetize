Say what's on your mind
But don't say what you can't take back
'Cause we're both broken-hearted
And lately we've been feeling like crap
This ain't no competition
If you want it that way, we can do it that way, now
The truth is there's no winner when you hurt somebody like that

When the party's over I'm still here with you
And tonight we are sober, looking at you
I'm saying this sober, I can't be with you right now
I know we got a million reasons why
We shouldn't be around each other right now
But when I find the one, the one reason why
Feels like I got a million reasons
I can't let go

I'm sorry, please forgive me
For keep on pulling you back every time you're leaving
And I'm sorry, I can't help it
You give me a million reasons, million reasons

It's hard to make sense
When your heart is messing with your head
I think we both know that we need to put this love to bed
It's like we keep forgetting
I should stay away from, you should stay away right now
I guess it's complicated when you want something that you can't have
