So broken, so broken

Sometimes when I fall down low
And I got no where else to go
I hide myself,  don't let it show
But you find me
Sometimes when the day goes by
I've missed it 'cause all I did was cry
You always know the reason why
You know me

You always got the words that never let me down, let me down
Always make me laugh somehow

You tell me don't worry
When I've done wrong
It's something that I'll never know
How you can love someone so broken, so right?
'Cause all I ever wanted, was a little bit of Paradise

Sometimes when I run too fast
You let me go don't hold me back
When I can't see the tracks
You find me
Sometimes when I can't see
I lose my balance and I can't breathe
You hold me close and brush your cheek on me
You know me

You always have the words that never let me down, let me down
Always make me laugh somehow

You tell me don't worry
When I've done wrong
It's something that I'll never know
How you can love someone so broken, so right?
'Cause all I ever wanted, was a little bit of Paradise

Woah-oh-ohh, woah (woah, woah, woah-oh-oh)
Woah-oh-ohh, woah (woah, woah)
Standing so close you're holding me up
I hope I give you just as much
'Cause you could never let me down
Even when I'm standing here now
So broken, arms open wide
'Cause all I ever wanted, was a little bit of Paradise

You tell me don't worry (don't worry)
When I've done wrong (wrong)
It's something that I'll never know
How you can love someone so broken, so right?
'Cause all I ever wanted, was a little bit of Paradise
Was a little bit of Paradise
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, woah
