Finally I'm where I wanna be
I didn't think this life was gonna be for me
A love you gave me to discover was right here
But now I'm caught up in a dream, don't wanna leave

See, I ain't been one for wishing, not at all
When you least expect, it's creeping up on you
No confiding nor abiding to no rules
And now I'm content knowing that I'm here with you

Right here, you got me where you want me
Now I'm right here, waiting for your calling
Now I'm right here, you got me where you want me
I'm right here, right here
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh

Infatuation took a hold of my mind
I wouldn't change it for the world, now that you're mine
You played mean, hard to get for a while
Still got me deeper every day with your smile

Oh yes, I've found that thing
Right here is where I'll stay
