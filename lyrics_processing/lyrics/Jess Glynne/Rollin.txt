Step back, go wrong with me
Don't hold me down
I've got a lot to give, but won't let it out
I know, I'm sensitive, riddled with doubt
You got a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot to learn
Karma's a real bitch, I've been there before
So if you're trying me, honey, I know
All of this back and forth, I need control
You got a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot to learn

So I'm sayin' fuck your games, this ain't the way I'm rollin'
The way I'm rollin', the way I'm rollin'
Hot and cold conversation ain't flowin'
No, it ain't flowin', no, it ain't flowin'
I tried, I tried time and time again
So fuck your games, this ain't the way I'm rollin'

Ooh-wop
Ooh-wop

I get bored easily, you're on borrowed time
If you ain't pleasing me, there's no more lifelines
And it's not out your hands, I've changed my mind
You got a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot to learn (Learn, learn)
Think you're doin' just enough to keep me there
Always pullin' back, actin' like you don't care
All this coming-going crazy, and that's not fair
You got a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot to learn

To tell the truth, I've seen the proof
You've got a lot to learn

So fuck your games, this ain't the way I'm rollin'
