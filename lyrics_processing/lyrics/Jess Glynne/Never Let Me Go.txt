Oh
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go

If I breathe a little deeper
When will you notice that I really need ya?
If I tell you all my secrets
Would you listen, would you believe it?

I know sometimes I am difficult
But I just wanted to let you know
I've been waiting on you all night
And I'll be waiting on you all night

Hold me
Like I'm falling from the top floor
Like my body's out of control
Come on, show me
That you'll never let me go, never let me go
Save me
Like I'm breathing in my last breath
Pull me closer into your kiss
Come on, show me
That you'll never let me go, never let me go
