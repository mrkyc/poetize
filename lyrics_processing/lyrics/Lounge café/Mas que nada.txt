And we won't stop until we get you, til we get you

Drop hot hot be my daily operation
Got to put a right in this crazy occupation
Gotta keep it movin' thats the motivation
Gotta ride the waves and keep a tight relation
With my team keeping moving and doing it right
I've been in a lab every day til daylight
Thats the way things move in this monkey business
We took a old samba song and remixed it
Mas que nada
Sai da minha frente
Eu quero passar
Pois o samba esta animado
O que eu quero e sambar
Este samba
Que e misto de maracatu
E samba de preto velho
Samba de preto tu
Mas que nada, we gonna make you feel lil hotter

Yo yo yo piano (echoing)
