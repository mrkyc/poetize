There's a drum line in my heartbeat
I know exactly what it's from
They're turning off the street lamps
They say the day is almost done
There's a ringing in my ears now
I remember how it was
The feeling we had last night
And it won't stop now because

Everybody says, "Hey, no!
We don't wanna see this day go
If I ever had my say, so
We can make this go all night, night, night"

'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way
You might also like
I got a song stuck in my head
I know exactly why it's there
There's a noise outside my bedroom
And I don't even care

If I ever said, "Go home"
Everybody here would say, "Hell no!"
All we gotta do is just let go
We can make it through the night

'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way

Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Yeah, we can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause I'm never gonna get these drums out of my head
And I'm never gonna get some sleep inside of my bed
And I'm sorry if "goodnight" is something I never said, said, said

'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way

Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Yeah, we can bring it back to life)
