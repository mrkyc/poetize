She's a bad girl
Met her in a mad world
Says she wants to slow down
But this is what I told her, now
Hello "Miss You-Fucked-Me-Over"
Got me looking over my shoulder
Telling me lies like I don't know the difference
It's no secret where you been
You ain't discrete while walking with him
Up in your skin, yeah I can see the fingerprints

So I went looking for my own something on the side
I've been living my life
I've been living my life, yeah
Yeah, you think nobody knows
His cologne on your clothes
Everything is alright
Everything is alright, cause

How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
Cause I've been doing that shit too
How could I ever be mad at you?
I can't hate on anything you do
How could I ever be mad at you?
Cause I've been doing that shit too

I got OCD when it comes to that pussy
Says she don't wanna push me, yeah
But this the way she took me
From a dream into a nightmare
I could see the devil - he's right there
Stumbled upon a pack of someone's cigarettes
In the backseat of your Honda
You can say whatever you wanna
That doesn't mean that I will think you're innocent

I'm all in it - past the limit
Knocking on the gates of heaven
Can I kick it?
I gotta find a piece of mind right now
Cause I'm losing my mind right now

So I went looking for my own something on the side
I've been living my life
I've been living my life, yeah
Yeah, you think nobody knows
His cologne on your clothes
Everything is alright
Everything is alright, cause
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
Cause I've been doing that shit too
How could I ever be mad at you?
I can't hate on anything you do
How could I ever be mad at you?
Cause I've been doing that shit too

She makes herself disappear like she's a magician
She's on her knees over there, but it ain't a religion
I know what you doin' doin' doin'
And who you doin' doin' doin' it to
Put her money on a horse and I bet it was Trojan

How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
How could I ever be mad at you?
Cause I've been doing that shit too
How could I ever be mad at you?
I can't hate on anything you do
How could I ever be mad at you?
