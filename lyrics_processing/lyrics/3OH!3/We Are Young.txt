Windows down, pedal to the sneakers
Turn up the volume, blow out the speakers
Best clothes on, goin' down on fire
Turn the lights off, turn the music higher

I broke free, cast away, won't find me
And now you're never gonna break me down, gonna break me down
This is all I can take, so farewell
'Cause you're never gonna find me now, gonna find me now

We are young! (whoa)
We are young! (whoa)
We drink and we fight and we love just because
We are numb (whoa)
We're on the run (whoa)
And you're never gonna chase us down...
We are young

Dance with the devil, don't be shy
Nothing's gonna stop us, we can't die
Sleepin' in a bed, waking up outside
At least I can say I tried
So fathers, don't let go of your daughters
We take what we want, we don't borrow
Think I found a message in a bottle
That says, "Drink me, drown your sorrows"
You might also like
I broke free, cast away, won't find me
And now you're never gonna break me down, gonna break me down
This is all I can take, so farewell
'Cause you're never gonna find me now, gonna find me now

We are young! (whoa)
We are young! (whoa)
We drink and we fight and we love just because
We are numb (whoa)
We're on the run (whoa)
And you're never gonna chase us down...

We are young, young, young (whoa)
We are young, young, young (whoa)
We are young, young, young (whoa)
And you're never gonna chase us down
We are young

If I'm doin' this right
I'll be leavin' tonight
I got my bags packed tight
So many reasons to leave
I got my hands on my keys
Yeah, I'll be leavin' tonight
We are young! (whoa)
We are young! (whoa)
We drink and we fight and we love just because
We are numb (whoa)
We're on the run (whoa)
And you're never gonna chase us down...

We are young, young, young (whoa)
We are young, young, young (whoa)
We are young, young, young (whoa)
And you're never gonna chase us down
