Space man
High as outer space man
Fucking ridiculous
My favorite album, Space Jam
Exit seat while I'm riding on your plane man
And I don't go HAM, I go corned beef
Singing slow jams in between gold teeth
At a karaoke stand with your girl getting drunk chief
She singing Journey
Getting hella horny
So she grabbed my face like Sigourney

At the 7-Eleven
Parked in the alley out back we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
Tracing lines on your skin we found heaven

She said she heard of me from that album Want
She used to bump it in the Target parking lot
In her '97 Dodge
Well that's hot
If her friends get together, maybe I could watch
I got the conch, ain't no Lord of the Flies shit
It's more like you'll be catching flies on your eyelids
But I keep crashing in the rocks of the sirens
Playing murder-fuck-kill with death on a desert island

Parked in the alley out back we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
Tracing lines on your skin we found heaven

We were alone, we were forlorn yeah we were castaway
We were marooned, yeah we were lost inside a foreign place
We lit a fire and said a prayer beneath the typhoon rain
Then we'd wake up and we'd be here and it'd be light again

Tequila soda
Talkin' like I'm Yoda
Trying to convince a girl that my bed ain't a sofa
Just come over
Maybe I could show ya
We could pull the mats out, you could teach me yoga
Hold up, I can't appreciate and deviate from any sort of discourse that could maybe aggravate you
Would you join me on a date through time?
I'll take you to the future
Where I blew your mind

At the 7-Eleven
Parked in the alley out back we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
Tracing lines on your skin we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
Parked in the alley out back we found heaven
