Nice legs, Daisy Dukes makes a man go *whistling*
That's the way they all come through like *whistling*
Low cut, see-through shirts that make ya *whistling*
That's the way she come through like *whistling*

'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down

I think I should know
How
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now
L-O-V-E's just another word I'll never learn to pronounce
How
Do I say I'm sorry?
'Cause the word is never gonna come out
Now
L-O-V-E's just another word I'll never learn to pronounce

Tight jeans, double Ds makin' me go *whistling*
All the people on the street know *whistling*
Iced out, lit up, make the kids go *whistling*
All the people on the street know *whistling*

Push it, baby, push it, baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow
Push it, baby, push it, baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know
