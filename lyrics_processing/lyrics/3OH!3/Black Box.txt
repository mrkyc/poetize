You think that I'm the type of guy that's fly, don't ya?
Come to Colorado, join the mile high, won't ya?
I'm in the corner of the bar in the booth sippin' Vermouth
Come and find me if you want the proof, poof
I can make you disappear like David Blaine, watch me
Sorry if I came off a little cocky
I'm just a dude sippin' whiskey casually out of a flask
In the back of your wedding, gettin' smashed

You shot me down in the middle of the night
You had me right in the crosshairs of your sight
You watch the smoke disappear into the light
A kamikaze flying in a Dogfights

I could say that I saw it from a mile away
But I lost who I am in a ball of flames
And I should've known you were bad on the day you came
Yeah, we crash landed, everything was lost
My heart tells a story like a black box

Snuck and put explosives in my chest, I blew up
My arms and legs are numb, I think I need some new ones
If you know a surgeon or a general physician
I'll be in the kitchen trying to drink away my issues
Hold it, it's not me, it's you, one liner
Now I can say that you're a shit designer
Went to college, getting C's to please the parent
It's apparent that they cost you money just for breathing air in
You might also like
You shot me down in the middle of the night
You had me right in the crosshairs of your sight
You watch the smoke disappear into the light
A kamikaze flying in a Dogfights

I could say that I saw it from a mile away
But I lost who I am in a ball of flames
And I should've known you were bad on the day you came
Yeah, we crash landed, everything was lost
