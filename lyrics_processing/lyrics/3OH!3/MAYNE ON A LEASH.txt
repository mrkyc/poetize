And like I walk in with a walkman call it
Got the heavy metal with the gold chain wallet
Flying V guitar gonna shred back your mullet
Loaded to the brim, write my name with a bullet
We don't need no one to tell us
Sick of motherfuckers keep on gettin' jealous
Diamonds in their eyes, thinkin' they can sell us
But I got enough green, you can call me pickle relish

You don't know the name but you know the sign
Coming through your spot drop the record one time
Surfin' on your couch and we droppin' dimes
Money on the brain but we're losing our minds
Buying all the drinks but my card's declined
Maybe we got dropped, but we got resigned
Maybe we got old but we age like wine
We got money on the brain but we're losing our minds

Put your mayne on a leash
Put your mayne on a leash
Put your, put your, put your, put your mayne on a leash
I don't hate nobody, nah I'm here to keep the peace
I just came to party, I ain't tryin' to fight the beast
I-I-I just came to party, I ain't tryin' to fight the beast
You might also like
Hanging in my car, I'm a parking lot loiterer
No chain 'round my neck lookin' like a goiterer
Sneakin on these beasts like a straight-up burglar
You can find me, huh, what the fuck rhymes with burglar
You can't call me inside boy
Pissin' in your passionfruit LaCroix
When I'm on the mic, I straight destroy
I'm lactose intolerant, you soybean boy

You don't know the name but you know the sign
Coming through your spot drop the record one time
Surfin' on your couch and we droppin' dimes
Money on the brain but we're losing our minds
Buying all the drinks but my card's declined
Maybe we got dropped, but we got resigned
Maybe we got old but we age like wine
We got money on the brain but we're losing our minds

Put your mayne on a leash
Put your mayne on a leash
Put your, put your, put your, put your mayne on a leash
I don't hate nobody, nah I'm here to keep the peace
I just came to party, I ain't tryin' to fight the beast
I-I-I just came to party, I ain't tryin' to fight the beast
There's something that I need to say
To cut through the bullshit
You don't need to be this way
You're better off without it
And if I can be honest
You deserve my promise
To love the twisted little beautiful disaster that's inside of you
'Cause your boyfriend is a problem, got a savior complex
Thin walls, hear him yell in your apartment complex
Watch it bubble to the surface, stressin' on your complexion
When you're dying for affection
You cut me down to save his name
I think he should be the one who's chokin' on your chain
Instead of giving you all of his pain

Put your mayne on a leash
Put your mayne on a leash
Put your, put your, put your, put your mayne on a leash
I don't hate nobody, nah I'm here to keep the peace
I just came to party, I ain't tryin' to fight the beast
