You're way too young to be broken
You're way too young to fall apart
You're way too young to play these games
But you better start
But you better start
This is when it starts
From the beating of your heart
'Til the streetlamps talk to you
Jumping off of the edge
Oversleeping your head
Everything's turning dark to you
I went to pick up the parts
The doctor's hiding the charts
He won't let me see this side of you
It's on the tip of my tongue
You know you're way too young
To have someone lie to you

I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
You'd better find somebody else and get a hold of yourself
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you

You're way too young to be broken
You're way too young to fall apart
You're way too young to play these games
But you'd better start
But you'd better start
It was the second I lit
Your first cigarette
I forget who you used to be
And I bit my lip
The second you sipped
The poison that was mixed for me
You might also like
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
You'd better find somebody else and get a hold of yourself
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you

Drink the poison lightly
'Cause there are deeper and darker things than you
I know 'cause I've been there too
I know it might seem frightening
To have the world fall apart right under your shoes
Trust me, you'll make it through

I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
You'd better find somebody else and get a hold of yourself
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
I'm not the one, I'm not the one who wants to hurt you
