Yeah, I'm standing outside the bar like a fish out of water
And I'm sorry to bother you miss, just so fine that I got her
Because I'm like that, 'cause I'm like that
I'm gonna buy you all a drink and I'll be right back

Drinks at the bar
With her friends there standing so far
But it feels near
If only she looks
I could take her home with me
I'll buy you a round
If you come close
Turn up the sound
Turn the lights down
Give me a chance
I will take her home with me
(You're gonna love this!)

Yeah, I don't know what's happening
And I swear to ya honor
That in my car the girl was biting on my lips like Jeffrey Dahmer
Yeah, it's like that, yeah, it's like that
I just drove her back to my place for a night cab
You might also like
Drinks at the bar
With her friends there standing so far
But it feels near
If only she looks
I could take her home with me
I'll buy you a round
If you come close
Turn up the sound
Turn the lights down
Give me a chance
I will take her home with me
(You're gonna love this!)
(You're gonna love this!)

Yeah, you know the flashing lights have got a hold on me
Yeah, I'm high on the feeling there's nothing wrong with me

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la...
(Oh yeah, you're gonna love this!)
Yeah, you know the flashing lights have got a hold on me
Yeah, I'm high on the feeling there's nothing wrong with me
Yeah, you know the flashing lights have got a hold on me
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Yeah, I'm high on the feeling there's nothing wrong with me
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
