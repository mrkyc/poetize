This town used to be a pretty place to stay
A place you'd stop off on the highway
But all of those things changed on the day
You packed up your bags and you ran away

All they say is how you've changed
Every day I stay the same
So you can keep the necklace that I gave to you
I'll keep the shitty tattoos

I can see it from the other side, the grass isn't always this green
The house is burnt to ashes, I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P (Oh-oh,) R.I.P (Oh-oh)
You and me
I can see it from the other side, the grass isn't always this green
The house is burnt to ashes, I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P (Oh-oh,) R.I.P (Oh-oh)
You and me

I count the empty bottles up on the bar
But I give up, I can't count that far
And the lights in this place are too dim to see
They're kickin' me out, it's a quarter past three
You might also like
They tell me you're all I've got
I just need these dreams to stop
You can keep the necklace that I gave to you
I'll keep the shitty tattoos

I can see it from the other side, the grass isn't always this green
The house is burnt to ashes, I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P (Oh-oh,) R.I.P (Oh-oh)
You and me
I can see it from the other side, the grass isn't always this green
The house is burnt to ashes, I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P (Oh-oh,) R.I.P (Oh-oh)
You and me

In the back of the car, on the way to your home
In the pouring rain, on the side of the road
In the light of the street, in the recline of the seat
You told me I should move on (On)
In the back of the car, on the way to your home
In the pouring rain, on the side of the road
In the light of the street, in the recline of the seat
You told me I should move on
I can see it from the other side, the grass isn't always this green
The house is burnt to ashes, I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P (Oh-oh,) R.I.P (Oh-oh)
You and me
I can see it from the other side, the grass isn't always this green
The house is burnt to ashes, I'm no longer in-between
R.I.P (Oh-oh,) R.I.P (Oh-oh)
