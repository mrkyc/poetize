Yes... Knoc-Turn'al
Yup... Let's go

It's amazing...how outta my life I made-short a long-story
I came a long way outta bullshit, but I ask for no glory
I came a long way from the pavement on the block, stackin' dough
And on a long day there would be a raid, and business was slow
How many times must I see a victim losing a life?
How many days must I hustle, 'fore my hustle get right?
How many days must the children duck when bullets take flight?
How would a gang act when one of they own is dying tonight?

Until the day (honey)
I wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)
I wanna hold you in my arms (my arms)
I wanna be your shining star (I wanna be)
Until that day
I wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)
I wanna hold you in my arms (aw yeah)
Gonna' be your shining st-arr (whoah-oh-ah-whoa)

It's amazing, how hard times; they come and they go
In the ghetto, these ghetto days we go with the flow
I spent my whole life hustlin'; grindin' the streets
And when hard times came, I regrouped and stood on my feet
When will it be safe for kids to go outside again?
When will the day come for us to love, and embrace a friend?
I travel all around the world workin', gettin' it right
Because the world is a ghetto, and the ghetto's my life

I wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Wanna hold you in my arms (my arms)
Wanna be your shining star (I wanna be)
Until that day
I wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Wanna hold you in my arms (aw yeah)
Gonna' be your shining st-arr (whoah-oh-ah-whoa)

It's amazing, how mothers in ghetto's hold they heads high
And when times get too hard, they just look to the sky
Pour out some drink, 'cause the homie would'a been 30 today
But tragedy struck at 14, and took him away
I want a new life where families don't have to cry no mo'
I know kids in the ghetto listen to Knoc-Turn'al
Until the day I get all my peoples off of the streets
Im'a be here: puttin' it down for L.A.C

Until the day (honey)
I wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)
I wanna hold you in my arms (my arms)
I wanna be your shining star (I wanna be)
Until that day
I wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)
I wanna hold you in my arms (aw yeah)
Gonna' be your shining st-arr (whoah-oh-ah-whoa)

Until the day (honey)
I wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)
I wanna hold you in my arms (my arms)
I wanna be your shining star (I wanna be)
Until that day
I wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)
I wanna hold you in my arms (aw yeah)
