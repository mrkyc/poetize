Warning the sergeant general of the west coast has now determined that the sounds you are about to hear may be devastating to your ears

Life is... Funny sometimes
Complex minds ride around the same guidelines
I'm here to hookup with Dre, and then all of a sudden you don't know
If you don't get to hear the voice bounce out your throat
Put some bass in your tone and stop speaking like a bitch

You can get gift-wrapped and sent home
Marching with back-bone, never alone
This ain't no theme song
Witness the birth of a team strong
And he's on stomping on your lawn with guns drawn

L.A. endo (Homicide)
Guns outcho window (Livin' my life)
Straight Westcoast
L.A. Confidential

O.G.'s, Murder One's, and some lokes
L.A.'s niggas, bang bang, I briefly spoke
Gain some fame, gained a name
Got some hoes, gained respect, and took some notes
Bandanas, khakis at the slausan
Outfit for homies, jacket, and robbin'
Crippin' and bloodin'
Rippin' and runnin' these streets
Enemies aimin' their guns at me
But it don't reach, what?
You thought you weren't gon' see me
You thought, L.A. confidential, you wasn't ever labeled with no G's
You don't think Dre thinks about these things
If I couldn't get you what you need, I wouldn't get fuckin' thing

L.A. Confidential

Gangsta's, bad bitches rolling with husltas
Parking lot pimps and bustas
Tricks and simps get set up
Tired of duct tape, kidnapped a plus

You can get gift-wrapped and sent home
Marching with back-bone, never alone
This ain't no theme song
Witness the birth of a team strong
And he's on stomping on your lawn with guns drawn

I've been knowing Dre for years, still ain't got put on
I met him and after ten minutes I was recording a song, huh?
What's really wrong is maybe a real one can't feel the fake page you on
Maybe I signed a record deal you was supposed to be on
Knoc-Turn'al, above and beyond, from dusk till dawn
Hustle to eat, get a g ride, rode the streets
And be defeat, ghetto livin', night vision, and casualties
