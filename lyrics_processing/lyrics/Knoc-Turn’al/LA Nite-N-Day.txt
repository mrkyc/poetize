Ahhh!
It's a good day in LA, yes it is (yes it is)
Motherfuckers can just wake up and relax
And smoke a fat blunt or some shit
Buy a fifth a Henn and get drunk (yes)
Hey, bring that over, call them up
Order me some motherfucking (Knoc-Turn' al) Hennesy

Wu-Tang got mansions in the hills
Hoe squat thick, hoe squat paying bills
Red & Meth on hot wheels bumping down Sunset
La Maridia, sky balling, what is this?
My eyes, they caught up in the sea, look at Jay-Z
At the Source's Swap Meet getting Memphis Bleek some fitted khakis
Yeah, well real niggas get passes sometimes
Out of bounds in the land of the sunshine
Even Biggie said he was coming back (coming back)
And if he did, we would accept him because a nigga is black
You bleed just like us
Picture me being scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
You bleed just like us
Was a song I did, bumped on blocks and beaches with beat in my trunk

 Night and day

Most of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love

Welcome players we'll gangster step
 Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
 LA!
Night and day
 Sraight up (what?)
 Welcome players we'll gangster step

Like watching ass sway back and forth (what up, girl?)
Macking the most, stripes on my coat, a bragging boast (West Coast!)
Jennifer Lopez and Puffy at Miyagi's eating sushi
Now, tell me what else does your eyes see
A lot of other Coast niggas pass through frequently and it's cool
Because y'all pay dues and I pay them too

 Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
 LA!
 Yeah

 Welcome players we'll gangster step
 Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love

 We in the land of the sunshine where bitches have good times
Palm trees and sea breezes
And I'm out to find a fly fine girl so I can try out my new mack lines

Too $hort? (yes), that's my dog (so)

Was he dope? (yes)
Is he fake? (no)
Weak game? (banging), hop ('64's)

 Straight up
 Welcome players we'll gangster step
 Most of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love

 In the land of the sunshine where bitches have good times
Palm trees and sea breezes

Yeah, fly is the weather - I feel the breeze
L.A.C. night and day
Inner city living with inner city game
Casuas fat laces on some new Chuck's (yes)
I got my running shoes on
Gangstered out from head to toe (head to toe)
Fucking hoes and patroling the hood
Heat on my lap looking for a light
Because, uh, I just rolled up a chronic sack
