About the little things in life that frankly there's no hurrying
Then i would be a rich girl, i wanna be a rich girl soon
But going at this rate i think that it may well take
'til there's life on the moon
Where does the time go? does anyone know?
Where does the time go? does anyone know?
Where does the time go?
If i could have a sneak preview to all the earthly reasons
It takes to make the them of time then i'd be a girl for all seasons
And i wouldn't have to worry, i wouldn't have to worry oh no no no
It just seems kind of funny that there's some things i'll just never know
Like where does the time go? does anyone know?
Where does the time go? does anyone know
Where does the time go?
We were only just saying just the other day
How it's really amazing how the days just seem to slip away
And it's right before my very own eyes
Oh there's some things that we'll never, we'll never know like
Where does the time go?
Where does the time go? does anyone know?
Tell me where does the time go?
Tell me where does it go?
There's some things we'll never know

I've been counting all my days
I've been counting all my nights
Tell me where does it go?
Where, where, where, where, where does it go?
The time go, the time go, the time go
Where, where, where, where, where does it go?
Does anyone know?
I've been counting all my days
I've been counting all my nights
