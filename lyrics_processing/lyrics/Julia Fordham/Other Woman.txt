You can't bring yourself to tell her
Old old habits die hard so hard
I could have told you that right from the start
It's no fun it's no fun being the other woman it's no fun
And I know what's wrong and what is right
I wonder where you are on some nights
New love shines so strong so clear
That's why I'm still standing here
It's no fun it's no fun being the other woman it's no fun
It's no fun it's no fun being the other woman
It's no fun anymore you won't run unless you're really sure
Both hands free and a heart that's tied
I said that I'm easy but I lied I lied I lied
There's no chance at all no running risk
You can't lose when it comes down to it
Old old habits die hard so hard
It's not my first and it won't be my last
It's no fun it's no fun being the other woman
It's no fun

It's no fun no fun being the other woman
It's no fun anymore you won't run unless you're really sure
Both hands free and a heart that's tied
I said that I'm easy but I lied I lied I lied
At the junction of the big surrender
You can't bring yourself to tell her
Old old habits die hard so hard
I could have told you that right from the start
It's no fun it's no fun being the other woman it's no fun
It's no fun it's no fun being the other woman
I don't want you anymore, anymore I lied I lied I lied
I don't want you anymore, I wanna be free, free, free
I don't want you anymore, anymore I lied I lied
I keep on lying, I keep on wanting you to want me
