I'm a woman of the 80s, I'm fit and I'm strong
There ain't no situation where I don't belong
Too late for flowers too soon for pins (too soon for pins)
But I know where I'm heading and I like where I've been
And I swear I never really ever really get that lonely on Sundays
Well maybe, just a little, but I'm never really ever really gonna
Let myself CALL YOU UP!
Cos I'm not allowed to miss you and I'm not allowed to ring you
I'm a woman of the 80s, no fractures, no flaws
But I miss you sometimes that's all
I'm a woman of the 80s, I'm single and I'm free
There ain't no complications between my lover and me
He's got my number and I've got his
And even though I MIGHT MISS HIM, I like it like this
And I swear I never really ever really get that lonely on Sundays
Well maybe, just a little, but I'm never really ever really gonna
Let myself CALL YOU UP!
Cos I'm not allowed to miss you and I'm not allowed to ring you
I'm a woman of the 80s, no fractures, no flaws
But I miss you sometimes that's all

If it's not on, it's not on and you never ever ever ever ever SWALLOW
