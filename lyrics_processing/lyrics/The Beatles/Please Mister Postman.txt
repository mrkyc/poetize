(Wait!)
Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
(Wait!)
Wait, Mister Postman

(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh, yeah!
(Is there a letter in your bag for me?)
Please, please, Mister Postman
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Oh, yeah!
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

There must be some word someday
From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I've been standin' here waitin', Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returnin' home to me

Please, Mister Postman!
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh, yeah!
(Is there a letter in your bag for me?)
Please, please, Mister Postman
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Oh, yeah!
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

So many days, you passed me by
See the tear standin' in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leavin' me a card or a letter

Mister Postman!
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Is there a letter, oh, yeah, for me?
(Is there a letter in your bag for me?)
I've been waitin' such a long time
(I've been waitin' a long, long time)
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! (Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! (Mister Postman)
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! (Mister Postman)
Check it and see one more time for me
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute

Wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! (Mister Postman)
Mister Postman (Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh, yeah (Mister Postman)
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! (Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Ooh! (Oh, yeah!)

Oh, yeah! (Mister Postman)
Gotta wait a minute, wait a minute!
