When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind

If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)
I don't know why you
Should want to hide (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
But I can't get through
My hands are tied (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
But I get turned away (Ooh, la la la)

And you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing (No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)
You might also like
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
And since I lost you
It feels like years (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
And I just can't go on (Ooh, la la la)

If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing (No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)

Though the days are few
They're filled with tears (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
And since I lost you
It feels like years (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
And I just can't go on (Ooh, la la la)
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

(Yeah) Ooh, la la la (Yeah, yeah)
