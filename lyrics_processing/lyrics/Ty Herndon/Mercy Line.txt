I was a little bit foolish
And I got a whole lot of pride
It took a whole lot of hammerin'
To get through this head of mine
But, I ain't ready, baby
To hang this one on the rack
I just want you to know that
Baby, I'm comin' back
'Cause I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line
Yes, I am. (Yes, I am.)
I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line
Oh, that sweet temptation
She's a fair-weather friend
I blew down that road
But I won't go there again
I love you absolutely
And if there's one thing I know
It's gonna take you, baby
For me to get back home
I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line
Yes, I am. (Yes, I am.)
Oh, oh, oh, I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line
Oh, yeah
You might also likeI done a whole lot o' hurtin'
And I had a lot o' hurtin' done
But I'll do my time
Until the healin' comes

Do what you have to do
Till I win back your trust
Our love is made of gold
Yeah, baby, gold don't rust
So when you're ready, willin'
And able to receive
You know just where you'll find me
I'll be here on my knees
I, I'm, I'm workin' on a mercy line
Yes I am. (Yes, I am.)
I-I, I-I, I'm workin' on a mercy line
Oh, yeah
I'm workin' on a...
I'm workin' on a... (a mercy line.)
I'm workin' on a mercy line
I'm gonna walk... (I'm workin' on a...)
I'm gonna walk... (I'm workin' on a...)
I'm gonna walk, (Yes, I'm workin',)
Back into your heart, babe. (On a mercy line.)
I'm workin' on a...
I'm workin' on a... (a mercy line.)
I'm workin' on a mercy line. (Yes, I am.)
Just keep on walkin', baby
Just keep on walkin', baby
(I'm workin' on a mercy line.)
Just keep on walkin', baby
Just keep on walkin', baby
