Oh, man, I wanna go to
The land of the good groove
Oh, man, I wanna go to
The land of the good groove

Oh, man, I wanna go to
The land of the good groove
Oh, man, I wanna go to
The land of the good groove

Lord knows where my body goes every night
I try to fight it
Long as there's good music, long as there's a all night dance
In my romance

Oh, man, I wanna go to
The land of the good groove

Lord knows where my money goes, but what the heck
I bought my house on spec
There's just one question left for this man
Is it in my good groove land?
