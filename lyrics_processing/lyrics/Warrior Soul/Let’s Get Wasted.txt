This is a dream rock battered in rage
The sensation over 
Your body is covered in vain
I'm a message, I'm a bastard
I'm a bitch with a ticket to love
You're a crashin' on the fashion
I'm a lookin' up to super god
You wanna die ya, so what?
No one cares if you're a suicide
You want everything 
Still not enough for you tonight
We're out trippin' the system
Cause a riot on a doomsday ride
Ray guns, radio blastin'
It's a fast lane fire fight
He's restricted
You're an explosion
Now you're addicted
Take a ride out into the sunshine
Breakin' laws, 'cause I feels so good
I don't really need any martyr
Is just a jerkin' off four Hollywood
All you big stars, I'm happy of you
Gee, I wish I could be that good
We're not tired
I'm a blowing like the heat in the sun
Shooting skyward
I don't leave until I have me some fun
Through the fallout
All you people wanna kick me around
Eat your heart out
I'm on target with the city sound
It's an explosion
Bleed like lights rays
Dig the emission
You're looking for a super fun
A come on baby, ya you get enough
I'm coming back in for some satisfaction
And you're looking like the main attraction
You're on fire a little baby
With your head kicked in
We desire another world devoted sin
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
I want fun and I'll make it
Let's get high, get wasted
Ya, the pigs can't take it
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
We're having fun now
We're not supposed to
Isn't it lovely?
I'm a telling ya, it's chronic
You're a tragic hipaholic
I'm a giving all I can girl
Now it's time for me to show ya
You wanna die ya, so what?
No one cares if you're a suicide
You want everything 
Still not enough for you tonight
You're trippin' on the system
Cause a riot on a doomsday ride
Ray guns, radio blastin'
You're a hit at the fire fight
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get high, get wasted
Let's get wasted, let's get wasted
Let's get wasted, let's get wasted
Let's get wasted, let's get wasted
Let's get wasted, let's get wasted
Let's get wasted, let's get wasted
