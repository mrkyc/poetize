The psychotic product of total frustration
Lost in the void of the social soup
Yesterday's plans went awry
I saw you standing there cold
So I picked up on the usual topic
(I feel the pain of a thousand wars)
I feel the pain of a thousand wars
I got no problems man
I got no problems man
I got no problems man
I live in TV land
I'm an electronic image
Beamin' out to you
Oh yeah
I see the ruins
I know we're losin'
We love our weapons
Blown into heaven
We're out of time
We're out of mind
Completely blind
To nature's sign
And we got nothing
You might also likeWasted in prison
A bad decision
You run to nowhere
You're blown forever
We stand confused on hard times
Can't break away from our crimes
This is the world, you have no choice
Now we're gone
We play the fools
We breaks the rules
We rape the earth
A blinded purge
And we got nothin'
Hate is a fire
It does not tire
You run to nowhere
You're blown forever
We stand confused on hard times
Can't break away from our crimes
This is the world, you have no choice
Now we're gone, yeah
One, two, three, four
Lock it
We stand confused on hard times
Can't break away from our crimes
This is the world, you have no choice
Now we're gone
I see the ruins
I know we're losin'
We walk the wasteland
Stripped down from God's hand
We live confused
Completely used
I'm so confused
I love you
Wasted
Wasted
Wasted
Wasted
Wasted
Wasted...

I've seen 'em all
Rotting in the sunshine
Faces of extinction
God, you live for nothing
You live for nowhere
You live for garbage
You live for hatred
You live for your own little piece of twisted under-privileged morsels

Bastards tearing a hole
My wet lungs smashed with yellow after the explosion
It began toward the urban hate machine
Sleeping in the alleyways, that's how it is
Equal minus real
