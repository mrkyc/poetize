Yeah, yeah
You wanna fire to the southern market
Gonna press into the sky, you wanna get some
You can't do better them me
'Cause I'm comin' on down the line of revolution
You're down man, but never die
You're just kickin' for a chance to fly the super culture
They say Rome wasn't built in a day
But you're never gonna find the truth until you try, girl

Wanna get some, I wanna get some

Annihilation
Don't bother
I live like an insane dog
A pressin' hard luck out to the limit, kiss off
You'd sell out for a nickel
Leave your friends crawling out of the sewers, blast off
Death scenes face before my eyes
I'm on the speed ride, shockin' the torture, no love
Target for the blazing sun
If I figure I can make a profit, right on
Oh
Oh
Don't bother (c'mon baby, yeah, give it to me)
