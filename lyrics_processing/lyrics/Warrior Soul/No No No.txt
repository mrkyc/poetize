The liars they can't stop you
They say that you are just a pain
So what man you inspire
And then the world comes crashin' down
And you're the toughest thing around
How many times they gonna count you out
And baby you don't care
They said no-one loves you
So what
And you're goin' somewhere
So let's go
No no no - you're not real
No no no - you're a drag
No no no - no appeal
No no no - come on man
We want more everything
We want more everything
We want more everything
We want more everything
Come on and take a fiece of me
If ya got the guts to take it
I don't get anything for free
Except the piss I'm drinkin'
And when they guddle up on you
And promise everything you're screed
How many times they gonna rip you off
You might also likeAnd man nobody cares
They said no-one loves you
So what
But you're goin' somewhere
So let's go
No no no - we can taste it
No no no - we get it all
No no no - you're degraded
No no no - we're havin' a ball
You live in the city
You live for fun
You look so pretty
But you're no-one
We live like we're goin' crazy
I'm a backstage sewer hole
Don't care man, I'm not bitchin'
Just livin' like rock - n - roll
Let's go out in the city and trash it
Like we're gonna die
Maybe we'll get arrested
The publicity is outta sight
No no no - you're not real
No no no - you're a drag
No no no - no appeal
No no no - come on man
No no no - no more religion
No no no - no more school
No no no - no more rejection
No no no - no more screw
