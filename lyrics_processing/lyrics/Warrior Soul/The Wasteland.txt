Detroit got stupid it was time to blow
I can't dig people when they play control
I rocked to Manhattan and what did I see
Some great big buildings that could set me free
The bars are open all night
But that damn AIDS test got me so uptight
I said that damn AIDS test got me so uptight
Pay your money to the landlord
Donald Trump is just a money whore
Under my bed there's a baseball bat
The goddamn taxes gonna break my back

I'm in the wasteland
I'm in the wasteland
I'm in the wasteland
I'm in the wasteland
I'm in the wasteland, mama you know it's true
No motherfucker's gonna tell me what to do
I'm in the wasteland

The gangs are doing drive by's in L. A
Quinn is drilling ink and we're getting laid
Your shotgun cops are going to hell
LAPD's got an awful smell
In Hollywood the scene's all there
Tommy's always got the drugs to go on a bender
Every time I go I never wanna come back
Breathe the summer air you'll have a heart attack
You might also like
You're in the wasteland
You're in the wasteland
You're in the wasteland
You're in the wasteland
You don't buy what the government sells
The goddamn President can go to hell
You're in the wasteland

I can't live unless I'm free
You've got to run to stay with me
I move from town to town
I'm living on the underground
Hey baby come with me
I meet a lot of good company
To beat the system move around
It's the only way to freedom today
Find the freedom today

If I make bail tell you where I go
Gonna cross the border into Mexico
Tequila's cheap as sunshine
Wind up banging everything in sight
I'm free and that's a fact
Once I leave I ain't never coming back
