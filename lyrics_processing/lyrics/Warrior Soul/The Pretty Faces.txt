You love the pretty faces
You put your burnin' faith in
We live in the coke culture
Advertised faith is our future
Saturate until you blitz out
Candidate for a teenage breakdown
Makin' love on a one-way jet ride
Engines on and we're ready to fly

Just because we're American, man
You think we're goin' somewhere
Well, we've already been there
Load the ships, we're ready to go go

Get shot with a plastic gun
