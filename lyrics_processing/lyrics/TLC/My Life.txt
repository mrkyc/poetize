And I believe it don't affect nobody else but me

Y'all been telling me what to do
Since I was old enough to walk, old enough to talk
Never let me speak or move, do my own thing
But now I've grown wiser now, brighter now
A little bit tighter now
And y'all can't hold me down
I know you hate to hear, but things have changed in my life

My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they mama try do it
My life
I done done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me
See TLC LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
I'm getting sick and tired of folks who wanna come around
Claim they gon' get down
But all they wanna do is see me make a wrong move, yeah
I don't care what you hear in the news
Or see who I choose to do the late night creep with
I'm gonna do just what I wanna do, it's my life

My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they mama try to do it
My life
I done done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me

Woah-woah-woah (Oh)
Woah-woah-woah, woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah, woah (Oh, oh)
Woah-woah-woah, woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah, woah (Oh)
Woah-woah-woah, woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah, woah (Mm)
And I believe it don't affect nobody else but me
Sometimes I might get a little crazy
And sometimes I might seem out of hand
But I'm sayin' life's too short for me to let you dictate
What I say and the moves I make
I'm sick of people tryna tell me what to do
It's my life and I'ma live it like I want to

Check it, another day another dollar
Is the reality of my mentality
Otherwise, don't even bother
You see, my father was a wise old man
Always creatin' a plan for me to conquer this land (TLC)
He said I am what I am, so be the best that I can
And if them others don't like it, then why should I give a damn? Huh
Maybe so 'cause when his life wasn't right (TLC)
My mother picked up them pieces, continued on with the fight
So now it's plain to me, it ain't no game to me
See, Mom and Dad corrected math, one and one equal three
Four and five, I count my sister and brother, stay alive 'til we die
And don't you ever be worried 'cause I'm down for the ride
Through peaks and valleys, no Crescent Hills
Tumble down, I'll set a new ground for Jack and Jills
Ever wonder what put the thunder deeply in my eyes?
Take a look and you'll find the sunshine
My life, my life, my life
My life
It's kinda wild, but me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they mama try to do it
My life
I done done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me
My life
It's kinda wild, but me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they mama try to do it
My life
I done done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
