What's up, y'all? (Ow)
It's Left Eye on the track (Ow)
My girl T-Boz over to my left (Ow)
Chilli is on my right (Yeah; shout)
We gonna teach ya'll how to shout (Ow)
Uh (Ow)
Check it out (Ayy)
What's up, what's up, woo (Shout)

Ooh, same damn time, every hurt or two
Something can happen to put me in the mood
Keep it inside 'til I turn dark blue
Trash everything I ever gave to you
Wrote it on the front of your Lexus Coupe
Didn't wanna leave you with a lame excuse
Sex so good, turns love to abuse
When you wanna leave, it's got you in a noose

It's not just when I'm in bed
Sometimes it's so frustratin'
I keep it all in my head
Until I just can't take it no more
It's not just when I get mad
Sometimes it's 'cause I'm so glad
That you are near me now
I just have to get it out (Shout)
See TLC LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
You gotta let me get it out
You gotta let it go away
Don't wanna spend another day on this
I feel like you make me (Shout)
You gotta let me get it out
The feelin' won't go away
Don't wanna spend another day on this
I feel like you make me (Shout)

Found somethin' in your pocket and I don't know why
I didn't say nothin' just sat and cried
Got me twisted all out inside
Not too long before the next ride
Over and over and over again
Instead of lettin' out, I always let it in
This is where the confusion begins
'Cause if you don't make me, you don't win

It's not just when I'm in bed
Sometimes it's so frustratin'
I keep it all in my head
Until I just can't take it no more
It's not just when I get mad
Sometimes it's 'cause I'm so glad
That you are near me now
I just have to get it out (Shout)
You gotta let me get it out, yeah
You gotta let it go away
Don't wanna spend another day on this
I feel like you make me (Shout)
You gotta let me get it out
The feelin' won't go away
Don't wanna spend another day on this
I feel like you make me (Shout)

Baby, just tell me what you wanna do
I can't help bein' in love with you
But sometimes I need you to turn me out
'Cause that's what lovin' is all about (Shout)
Baby, just tell me what you wanna do
I can't help bein' in love with you
But sometimes I need you to turn me out
'Cause that's what lovin' is all about, yeah (Shout)

Check it, I knew that it was only time before my rhymes
Would dig into my mind and get crazy out of line
I do my best to never disrespect
My girls in TLC or my fans, so let me speak my love and peace
All about in this world full of doubt
Is you down for the count? Do you hoes still amount
To the price that we pay to remain up in this crucial game?
Call it a test, a game of chess, let's play
Me and you, one on one, breakin' the ice 'til the water runs
Down my face like a chase, now do you hear the guns?
Here I come and won't quit until the job is done
Quiet storms will inform you that I've just begun
Grippin' the spot 'til it's hot, if you want what I got
See me down to the dot-dot-com
And keep it comin' with your best shot
If you're short or can't rely, then let's not (Shout)
You gotta let me get it out (Gotta let me get it out, yeah)
You gotta let it go away
Don't wanna spend another day on this
I feel like you make me (Shout)
You gotta let me get it out (Hey, hey)
The feelin' won't go away (Oh, oh)
Don't wanna spend another day on this
I feel like you make me (Shout; oh)
You gotta let me get it out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You gotta let it go away (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't wanna spend another day on this (Oh, oh)
I feel like you make me (Shout; oh)
You gotta let me get it out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
The feelin' won't go away (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't wanna spend another day on this (Oh, oh)
