Yo, it's me, Left Eye not about to settle
For anybody wit' a thang about me havin' to party
My life's havin' fun, takin' a reason, addin' season
Makin' it he's in what is pleasin' 'cause yo, I gots one
I am unordinary, the more balls, the merry
Not two hangin' hairy wit' dairy airy
'Cause to impress me is not to undress me
Dat's only unless we agree; you down wit' O.P.P?
And bein' honestly is what I want you to be
You wanna control me, you need much authority
Understanding the depths of the 90s women
That is the way dat I'm livin'

Das da way we like 'em (Ooh)
Das da way we like 'em (Uhh)
Das da way we like 'em (Das da way)
Das da way we like 'em

What up, what up, yo
The way that I like 'em
Or better yet, let's talk about the way I dislike
The type dat's always out to despite
Or what about the ones
The ones dat's under your feet
Or like to wipe your butt before you're leavin' the dookey seat
But so, take your time and you'll find dat it is true
I like the ones (That)
Walk through the parties wit' their pants saggin' down
Spend a little time wit' me and not wit' the crowd
Chillin' in the crib wit' da docs on
Maxin' on the couch to a Babyface song, yeah
Understanding the depth of cool women
Uh, cause dat's the way T-Boz is livin'

I like a man with romance in his heart
And the ability to chik-chik take on the part
Not the kind who be tippin' and tappin'
Slippin' and slappin' 'em
'Cause I'll be out there wit' a bat and start smackin' him
But wait a minute, I ain't dealin' like that, no
I need a man who's gonna venture out at pleasin'
Yeah, dats me, hey
'Cause I'm the kind who'll be givin' it right back
But on the serious tip, he's gotta come with respect
'Cause that's where I'm at, doh
Understanding the depths of the good women
Yeah that's me cuz that's the way aat Chilli's livin', hahaha
