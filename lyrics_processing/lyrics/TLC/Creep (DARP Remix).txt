Yes it's me again
It's me too girl
And I'm back
Don't forget the Left Eye
And Chilli in the house
Oh I oh I oh I baby (come on y'all)
Oh I oh I oh I yeah (check it out)
Oh I oh I oh I baby (come on)
Oh I oh I oh I yeah

The 22nd of loneliness and we've
Been through so many thangs (Check it out)
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me
I look him in his eyes but all he
Tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down though
I might mess around it's only
Cause I need some affection oh

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep
See TLC LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'
Cause I still feel the same, yeah, yeah (Check it out)
I'll keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected, oh

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

I think about us baby all the time
But you know that I'm gonna need some attention
Yeah, yeah can you dig it?
Love you forever baby soul & mind
But you gotta know if you don't give it
I'ma get mine yeah
Oh I oh I oh I yeah (come on sing along y'all)
Oh I oh I oh I yeah (Left Eye, Left Eye, Left Eye...)
Oh I oh I oh I baby (Left Eye, Left Eye, Left Eye...)
Oh I oh I Oh I yeah
Oh I Oh I Oh I am the surgeon general
I do believe in lyrical miracles (Warning!)
Creepin' may cause hysterical behavior in the mind
Put your life into a bind and in time
Make you victim to a passionate crime
Pregnant women put themselves at greater risk of bein' dissed
Known as no one for not knowin' who the daddy is
Which may result in little kids growin' up by the dozens
Gettin' sexually involved with first cousins
Creepin' is the number one item on the chart
Rippin' families apart the leadin' cause of a broken heart
Injuries can be fatal may infect the prenatal
HIV is often sleepin' in a creepin' cradle

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low (I Creep around)
(Because I need some attention)
Said nobody is supposed to know (Don't mess around)
(With my affection, yeah)
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep
Oh I oh I oh I yeah

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
