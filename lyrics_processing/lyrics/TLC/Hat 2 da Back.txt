Hahahaha, what up?
Sup T-Boz?
Yeah, what's up Chilli?
What up, Left Eye?
Yo, where's Left Eye? Did she leave? "I left" Hahah

Bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to, uh
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you
Bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free
And you better believe I'll do what pleases me
Yo, Left Eye, kick the scene

Every day, last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' 'cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up (Knock-knock) 'til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo, just to let ya know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

Some people just don't understand the things I do
(You feelin' it "D", you feelin' it?)
Chillin' with the girls or kick it with the fellas if I choose
And bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Dumb rules are left for fools with no attitude (Hahaha)
I think my way is cool
So let me be me, continue bein' real smooth
Yo, Left Eye, what's up wit' that guy?

So yo, get it back to this dude wit' the foul attitude
Shoot, he made another bad move sayin' that
Girls shouldn't wear baseball caps, he can go take a hike
'Cause it's the style that I like, yeah, it's a trip
'Cause somethin' hasn't yet been said
I never talked about them damn finger waves in his head
Tight pants and two rings in each ear
You know that is dead, but it's me instead

Don't cha know I really don't give a damn
Let me be me for me and not what I'm supposed to be
So I'm gonna do what I wanna do
'Cause dumb rules are left for silly fools
That's the kinda girl that I am, oh
(Here we go, here we go, here we go again)

Some people might wonder why we're like that
(Cause we're smooth)
Smooth as... ah
Why not?
Relatively speakin' I am no ordinary dip
'Cause I ain't reachin' hipped
Til you be thinkin' I'm flipped
