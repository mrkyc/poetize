The 22nd of loneliness
And we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheating on me

(Creep) I look him in his eyes
But all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection

So I creep, yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
Oh, so I creep
