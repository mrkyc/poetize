I ain't never been no silly ho
Waitin' for your call
Like the other girls want you
I ain't never been the one to mess
With someone else's mess
That's not a thing for me to do
I ain't never been that chicken-head
To wake up in your bed
After every club or two
Gonna be the one to make me skurt
Always wanna flirt
With every player on the team

So if you really wanna find someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know, boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know, boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
