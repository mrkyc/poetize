We met at the park at the Summer Jams
Tims untied with saggy pants
Not the kind of guy I would give a chance
But he was kinda packin' under circumstance
6 foot 3 sexy as can be
Saw him through the crowd comin' up to me
He said 'aren't you that shorty from TLC?'
He told me 'bout the things he would doin' to me
See TLC LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like

And then he went (Come on y'all! Dip!)
Right to sleep on me (Do the Left Pimpin')
I could not believe (Come on everybody! Dip!)
Wake it up and give me what I need

First he came
And then he went (Yeah, yeah)
Right to sleep so fast (Dip!)
Did he have it up his sleeve? (Do the Left!)
To pull a quickie on me (Come on, you ain't skippin you ain't pimpin)

Called me up to apologize
Said he owed me one, it's a night for night
Didn't know if he should get another chance
But he was kinda packin' under circumstance
He didn't know that I peeped him out
Picked up on what a quickie is all about
So I waited till I get him back to the crib
So I could switch it up and show him how it is

(Man, I heard you pulled a quickie)

Just like sweet rivers
I got a tasteful flow
My ears and neck shivers
With this icy snow
Head soulfully quiver
Cause the rhythm knows
How to correlate
With necks till vertebrae's blow
I murder days though
Meanin' I kill time
You heard of Mayo?
Well, my cars do real fine
Miracle Whip this lyrical chick
On some spiritual shit
This will be a perennial trip
Damn (damn)
