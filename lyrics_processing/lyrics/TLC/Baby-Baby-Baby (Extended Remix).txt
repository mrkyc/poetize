A-yo what's up
This is Left Eye
Uhhh you know cuz the eye is right
Check out this phat remix kinda like Slim Fast
Baby baby baby
Ya know what I'm sayin'
T-Boz won't you kick the ballistics

Hey, you want my love?
Well that's alright
Well it will be there for you morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved (huh)
Hey that's O.K
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nigga gotta be true
Cause otherwise this beat ain't got no time for you

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Oh baby, baby

Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Well, you want my heart, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me, won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

Long as you know that I can have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up (Ohhhhhh)

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me (Gotta be true, you gotta be down)
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby (Oh my baby)
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
Baby, baby, baby (Ain't got no time for the part-time lovin')
I got so much love in me
I gotta be loved if that's ok
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep (Get me off)

Baby long as you know that I can have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and it's factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up

Well, you want my heart, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me, won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

Excuse me if I put a lot on it
Daggone it
As if you didn't know how much you want to really want it
In place it has effects in case your mind is in the gutter
I left the triple A's
And she surely don't stutter
A privilege it is to be considered as a great
And you remind me of my past cuz they are very upliftin'
And plan to give a little but a lot is what you want
And like my hat is 2 da back we can both sit down in front
I understand what a man is all about
You understand I can't have anybody else without a doubt
We understand that you as you I wouldn't want to be without
Understandin' is the key which holds a very large amount
And bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Heck just expect to be checked
Return the favor and the rest just flows
I'll be standin' on my toes as the rest turn into ho's
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
I got so much love in me (So much love in me!)
Baby, baby, baby (Oh yeah)
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep (Love me deep)

I can have any man that I want to
Time and place that I choose to
But I'm thinking that I would rather be here with you, yeah
That's actual and factual
You're the one I seem to run back to, just to get me off
