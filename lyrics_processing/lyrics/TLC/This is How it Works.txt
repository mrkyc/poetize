Not everybody knows just how to do it
Some just learn it on the way
Once you get it right, ain't nothin to it
If you wanna get it right, you gotta learn to pace

Make it smooth (Make it smo-ooh-ooh-th)
Take your time, make it groove (Make it gro-ooh-ooh-ve)
In, out, in make it last (Make it la-a-ast)
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss my ---
Ah, ah, ah

This is how it works
Wrap your hands around my body
This is how it works
Go due south
This is how it works
Melt yourself into my body
This is how it works
Kiss my mouth

Some guys think they know the answers
Everybody knows how to make you scream
If most guys took time out their fantasies
Maybe we could stop our make believe

Ready, set, go
You don't have to know
We can take forever, learn together any flow
Touch me slow, watch it grow
Kiss the tip, gently blow, be my ho and tape the show
We can watch it in slow-mo, when the sweet and low drips

Write love letters back and forth across your lips
Spread my hips, count to eighty, eighty ways, eighty trips
