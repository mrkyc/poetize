(Ha-ha-ha, I know, I love this shit)
Well!
Well!
Well!
(Oy, you're a fuckin' punk, ha-ha)
Well...

We spun like birds on fire right
Down towards the residents, and I
I took all that I desired
Even crooks have to pay the rent
A-we swam like rats on fire right
Right down the reservoir
We took all that we could carry, but we
Tried to carry more

And you know, and you know, you know it all went wrong
And you know, and you know, you know it was all wrong

Ahh, da-da-dee-da-ah, a-da-da-da-ah
Da-da-dee-da-dah, way, a-da-da-da-da-ah

We choked on straight tap water, well
I'm going to have to try the real thing, ah
I took your laugh by the collar
And it knew not to swing
Any time I tried an honest job, well
The till had a hole in it, ha-ha
We laughed 'bout payin' rent
'Cause the county jails, they're free

And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
Ohh!

Ada-dada-dada-dada-da-eh
Lada-dada-dada-da-eh, a-da

Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll, rage of a child
Well, deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll, rage of a child
Oh, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
I said, it looks like it's time to use my feet again
Well, I just spent my last one hundred dollars
Gotta pay my bail again, no, no, that's
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, I don't care
Huh, huh, huh, huh, hah, hah, I just don't care

Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll kicked by child
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a bird dog race had made tired, well

King Rat has me on his list again
And can never be on the fence again, well I
Found out his soul, well, it opened like an organ
And he talk, talk, talk, talk again, well
Honest, even when I cheated them, but I could
I owed them my heart, well
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky me again

Deep water, deep water, deep, senseless denial
I got fed like a fist full of open smiles, ah, well
Dew water, deep water, oh, senseless denial
I got fed a fist by that con fuck "Styles"
I said, well, well
What do you have to say for yourself?
I said well, well, well
I said well, well, well, well, well

Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
I hardly knew I should use my feet again
(What do you have to say for yourself?
