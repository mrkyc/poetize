So, turn off the light cause it's night on the sun
You're hopelessly hopeless
I hope so, for you

Freeze your blood and then stab it into, in two
Stab your blood into me and blend
I eat my own blood and get filled up, I'll get filled up
I get filled up on me and end

So, turn off the light cause it's night on the sun
You're hopelessly hopeless
I hope so, for you
So, turn off the light cause it's night on the sun
You're hopelessly hopeless
I hope so, for you

Freeze your blood and then stab it into, in two
Stab your blood into me and blend
I eat my own blood and get filled up, I'll get filled up
I get filled up on me and end

Freeze your blood and then stab it into me
Freeze your blood and then stab it into me
Freeze your blood and then stab it in two into me and blend
