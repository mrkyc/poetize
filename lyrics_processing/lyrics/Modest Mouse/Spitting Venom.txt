We were spittin' venom
At most everyone we know
If the damned gave us a road map
Then we'd know just where to go

Now, let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Ah, let it all fall off

Well, you were talking soda pop
You talked it quite a lot
The opinions that I do not give
And the opinions I ain't got

So let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Let it all fall off

(Well, oh, ahh, ooh)
Well, you were spitting venom
At most everyone you know
If you truly knew the gravity
You'd know which way to go

Well, let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

My ears were pressed so firmly
Right against your mouth to hear
When you tried to spit the venom out
Your words were not so clear
Now drop

Hold on to what you need
We've got a knack for fucked up history
Hold on to what you need
We've got a knack for messed up history

Well, we went downtown
And we sat in the rain, both
Lookin' one direction
And waitin' for a train
Of thought over
Thought over
I don't who kept track
I didn't know there was a score
But it looks like you're the winner
And I ain't gonna play no more
It's over
Game over

Well, we walked real stiff
And our canes tapped the ground
You hit me with yours
And said "You're gonna stare me down"
It's over
Oh, it's over
You can say what you want
But don't act like you care
It takes more than one person
To decide what's fair
It's over
Think it over


You were spittin' venom
At most everyone you know
If the damned gave you a road map
Then you'd know just where to go
So we carried all the groceries in
While haulin' out the trash
And if this doesn't make us motionless
I do not know what can
So's to say, oh, what a rotten thing to say
Such an awful thing to say
I didn't mean to bite you, sorry
What always did, what "always" did
What always had to slang
So let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off
Let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off


Cheer up, baby
It really wasn't always quite so bad
