I hope that you like it in your little motel
And I hope that the suite sleeps and suits you well
Well, I can see it as time and a sight through smell and
That's why it's nice to be by yourself

'Cause that's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for, darlin'

We treat mishaps like sinking ships and
I know that I don't want to be out to drift
Well, I can see it in your eyes like I taste your lips and
They both tell me that we're better than this

'Cause that's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for, darlin'

We trade tit for tat like that for this
And I don't think that there was an insult that was missed
I can see it in your eyes like I taste your lips and
I'm very sorry

'Cause that's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for, aren't I?
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for
That's what I'm waitin' for, darlin'


Remainders of a shooting star
Landed directly on our broke down little car
Before then we had made a wish
That we would be missed
If one or another just did not exist

'Cause that's what we're waitin' for
That's what we're waitin' for
That's what we're waitin' on, aren't we?
That's what we're waitin' for
That's what we're waitin' for
That's what we're waitin' on, are we?
That's what we're waitin' for
That's what we're waitin' for
That's what we're waitin' for, darling
That's what we're waitin' for
That's what we're waitin' for
