Well, all's not well but I'm told that it'll all be quite nice
You'll be drowned in boots like mafia
But your feet will still float like Christ's
Well, I'll be damned
They were right
I'm drowning upside down
My feet afloat like Christ's
I'm in heaven trying to figure out which stack
They're going to stuff us Atheists into
And Peter and his monkey laugh and I'll laugh with them
I'm not sure what at
They point and say:
"We'll keep you in the back,"
Polishing halos, baking manna and gas

Well, some guy comes in looking a bit like everyone I ever seen
He moves just like Crisco disco
Breathin' a hundred percent Listerine
He says looking at something else but directing everything to me
"Any time anyone gets on their knees to pray
Well, it makes my telephone ring" and I'll be damned
He said, "You were right, no one's running this whole thing"
He had a theory, too

He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself
And you of you
He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself
And you of you
He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself
And you of you
