Which faith can speak the words that make my purpose clear?
The one that so inspires me to rid myself of fear
The one that speaks the truth so far as I can hear
Who has the answer?

As I begin to grow my mind's not satisfied
With remnants of the truth that seem not fully justified
With hypocritic views so righteously denied
Who has the answer?

We seek that part of truth that we best understand
Or that part that we can readily accept
But the wise old doors of time will open up our mind
When we're ready to find the inner depth

On Sundays we should live as all days of the week
A life that brings us closer to the truth that we would seek
The book of truth is near if we could get a peek
Tell me who, who has the answer?

We all will seek the truth as much as we can bear
In every faith that man believes you'll find a little share
But when we go to church if we don't find it there
Who, who has the answer?
You might also like
I'm searching, searching for the truth wherever can it be
The one true faith that has the key to free the inner me
For when I've found the key I'll turn the lock and see
Who has the answer

We're searching for it here, we're searching for it there
We can take our time in searching all about
But the thing we're searching for is not outside our door
It's been waiting within and not without

So worship where you may though it be near or far
Remember that your chapel light is right here where you are
For right inside yourself is found the shining star
Who has the answer

Tell me, tell me
Who has the answer?
Tell me, tell me
Who has the answer?
