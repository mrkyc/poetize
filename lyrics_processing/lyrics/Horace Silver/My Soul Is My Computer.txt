So much has been said about soul, it's been used as a racial phrase
Haven't you heard about soul flicks and soul food these days?
Religions preach save your soul or you surely will burn in hell
We'd like to air out a few of our views if there's anything left to tell

My soul is my computer, my IBM machine
It registers life's lessons and what I think they mean
To get the real true meaning of lessons as they're taught
Control of mind and body is something to be sought

The promptings of the spirit can spur my will I find
And lead me to the lessons that elevate my mind
To understand the spirit is what I'm aiming for
And profit by the lessons that knock upon my door

While my spirit is encased in my computer
The former is neuter to my will
Yet its promptings if followed as a tutor
Can lead me to the goals I must fulfill

The total computation that my computer makes
Will incarnate my spirit and form desire takes
When all desire ceases, computer's work is done
I'll come to know the spirit and freedom will be won

The principles I value experience has taught
But have I fed computer the proper train of thought?
Experience the teacher will make me weak or wise
Evaluate the lessons and then computer rise

The many imperfections of personality
Are here in my computer within the depths of me
As I begin to profit from lessons life will teach
My soul computes the progress my character has reached

While my spirit is encased in my computer
The former is neuter to my will
Yet its promptings if followed as a tutor
Can lead me to the goals I must fulfill

If I will start correcting my personality
My character will shape up to make a better me
With character perfected I have no further need
