I woke up this morning, I look to the sky
And I think that I'm blessed
Phone got a text, plug is supportive
If he think that I'm blessed
Keep that protect, you peek at my set
Deep my team it is blessed
You look at my girl, oi it's a peng ting
Know that she blessed

Money man, money man, money man
You know that's what they all hollering
Kelvyn Colt, stay afloat, cash flow
Bring pound, yen, euro and dollar in
Mess with my bands though
Truss I buss in like I'm Rambo
Till everything here lock off
Look at your gear, near, see is a knock off
Chop chop till my food proper
You thinking it is drugs
Cus I talk about the supper
Hardly eating
Cuz I'm always in the Lab
Cooking tracks
Bumping that In the back
Matt black bimmer
German whip
Blessed living like a sinner
So If it ain't a about a thick mixed chick
Tell a prick quick go fuck off
Stick shift, whip go skrt skrt, cut off

Heute brexit, dann morgen Hochzeit
Hab ne Firma, kann ein bisschen rappen
Irgendwann wird's klappen
Young man with a older head
