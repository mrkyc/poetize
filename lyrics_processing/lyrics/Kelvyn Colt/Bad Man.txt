The man wanna capitalise on my voice and my bars
While I'm up at the yard
Doing late night hours with a couple of pals
Like celibates we ain't fucking with y'all
What you wanna celebrate if you ain't raising the bar
Ten or eight rounds ahead chasing the art
No bed time less, it's head time or sex
I got needs, please do consider
Flow on beats, these tunes get lit up
Hope it all work out unlike sit-ups
Please do not worry 'bout where Colt live at
Semi-automatic
How I'm busting out the attic
Made it out the fucking garage
Bigger than I planned it
Colt got no Luck but work ethic
Netflix chill invites, I f' em
In her scope, no deals by Geffen
I write till my flow drills, 6-7
Mills out their pocket (sheesh!)
Hit stage, it's a mosh pit (sheesh!)
Only go sleep if the grocery
Smell made me noxious
Smell fuckeries men and women do
Only keys and numbers can speak the truth

Bad man ting but the man don't know
Want that gyal and I want bare dough
Phone might ring, they write to Colt
Bad man busy, bad man on road

With me 10 G's from road
Legal dough still look like road
Just to piss off staff when we do our shows
Where girls, hipsters, gangsters come close
They all want to be in paradise
Wins hardly come through pair of dice
Many try to leach, parasites
Gotta cut 'em raw like a bag of white
When you do spot em'
Half my niggas shotting
I just stayed focus
'Cause I don't want bars
Got too many bars
Cool like my hotel room mini bar
That's not very, getting heated up
Mama worried I don't eat enough
Gotta grind hard, my team feeding of
That all too 0-3-0 to Timbuktu
Back to zone 3, they all groove
UMG never wanted me
But Universal be my tunes
Kind of omnipresent
I don't want your presence
Neither do I want your presents
Beware of people who invite you
To claim they fed ya
Bad man ting but the man don't know
Want that gyal and I want bare dough
Phone might ring, they write to Colt
