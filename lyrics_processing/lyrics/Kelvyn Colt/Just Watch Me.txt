I had a lot dreams growing up
Magnitude intimidating 'cause the road is tough
Heart was aching 'cause our kind is never understood
People doubt you if you doing things they never would
Get a hand out, I wished a dreamer would
Hands down, till a man's down, gotta do it
Working class and electrified
Gas I'ma smash till I pass all the privileged guys
Negative energy get me amplified
I been touring France without dope to get me high
Yah, ay, on guard I'm strong
Rocks on the rings of the team's are milestone

Just watch me
Gon' get a whole lot of gold on the neck
Just watch me
Doing things that you saying that I can't
Just watch me
Came here with a dream to achieve
Just watch me
Ay, ayo, brother, just watch me
Ay, ayo, sister, just watch me

Ay, I never did it for the mass appeal
Committed 10,000 hours trying to master skills
Ay, and now my spirit can't be tamed
Body is in shape, prepared to bare the weight
Of the world on my shoulders
And every obstacle I'll face with composure
Yeah, that is what my dreams are made of
And every night I didn't sleep is gonna pay off
Show everyone that ever doubted me they way off
Set, ready, go for the take off
Just watch me, yeah, ay
Saying "set, ready, go for the take off!"

Ay, ayo, sister, just watch me

Just watch me (watch me, watch me)
Just watch me (watch me, watch me)
Just watch me
Ay, and all my haters, just watch me
Ay, and all my bitches, just watch me
Ay, and then my ex gon' watch me
