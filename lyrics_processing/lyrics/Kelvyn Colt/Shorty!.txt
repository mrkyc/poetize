(Yeah, yeah)

I always keep it one hunnid
Back what I say with my money
10k per diem, my DMs got BMs who callin' me honey, yah
Gucci all down to my socks, ayy
Rickie di rick be the top, ayy
I'm in the VIP smokin' pot, ayy
Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up
That rapper really tryin' find me
But I got TBHG behind me
Used to sleep in the dirt, it was grimy
But I put in that work, don't remind me
Yah, yah
I'm the top shotta from Berlin
I leave Berghain with your girlfriend
Naija boy until the world end
What? What?
Digga, I don't give a fick
You think I care what a blog gotta say about me?
My whole life I ate shit
I do not care 'bout this shit, yah
I do not care 'bout the beef, yah
I do not care about Instagram
That algorithm don't care 'bout me
K to the C, I was made overseas
Then I came to the scene, I don't cater the scene
I am the alpha and omega
Y'all nigga vocabulary from A to the B
So fuckin' scary, I scared off the beat, huh
I am a freak, huh
I'm in too deep
I want a freak, send a pussy to sleep

Shorty

I came to party (Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)

Roll it up, ah, roll it up, ah, roll it up again
Light the spliff, take a hit, pass the spliff to your friend, boom
Roll it up, ah, roll it up, ah, roll it up again
Light the spliff, take a hit, pass the spliff to your friend, boom
Roll it up, ah, roll it up, ah, roll it up again
Light the spliff, take a hit, pass the spliff to your friend, boom
Roll it up, ah, roll it up, ah, roll it up again
Light the spliff, take a hit, pass the spliff, ah (Uh)

I don't fight but my ho 'bout it
Givenchy my whole body
That trap house, my penthouse
That get dough, we all 'bout it
French trunks full of new Cali
Swapped the Benz truck for the new Audi
Everything German engineerin'
That horse power, that big body
Mask on, fuck a name tag
Whole rap scene got the same swag
I'm low-key, but they know me
No IG, I don't need to brag
Lotta cash in that paper bag
I drown pussy, y'all pay for ass
Same flight, but a different class
Same height, but a different mass
I'm made in Europe, roots African
Where you from? I don't care to ask
Small talk, had enough of that
Ayo, DJ, come on, bring it back
Ayo, DJ, come on, bring it back
Ayo, DJ
