Love and hate, yeah
Only one can take the pain away
Feeling numb, I might go Kurt Cobain (bang)
Going crazy
I'm going crazy
Yeah I'm going crazy

I wake up, go to bed
Day and night stuck in my head
Time and space, not becoming one
Try to finish, it ain't getting done
It's a cycle, it's a mirror
Hamster wheel, see me running scared
Stranger things, there are things
Waiting for me, I don't wanna know
Where they waiting, I don't wanna go
So I do things that never will be honourable
I'll apologize to whoever heart I broke
I'm sorry, I was anxious
Feel alone amongst people
Loneliness for me is danger
Depression turns to anger
And that be spreading like a cancer

The other day I wrote a letter
I hope you never get to read it
I just hope I make the weekend
Don't want you to find me hanging or bleeding
I feel terrible for being weak
I am not in love with being me
Now I'm pending
Yeah I'm pending

Between love and hate
Only one can take the pain away
Feeling numb, I might go Kurt Cobain (bang)
Love and hate
They want me to medicate
Begging me to change my ways
Going crazy, I'm going crazy
Yeah I'm going crazy
Love and hate
Only one can take the pain away
Feeling numb, I might go Kurt Cobain (bang)
Going crazy, going crazy
Yeah I'm going crazy

Amidst these shattered pieces
Naively I believe in peace here
Your God I don't fear
I heard god means love, yeah
Last years like this year
My past years, under carpet
Shoes on, though you come in
Last night's food is on the carpet
Both know how it looks like here
So why the fuck you have to comment?
I don't fuck with fake woke shit
You talk or I'll keep walking
You keep showing me articles
Links to mental health blogs
Talking about how you care about me
But none of us here got self love
You're telling me to reflect more
But in the mirror that effect's gone
My days are so long
I long for nights back home
Fake friends lack backbone
Real ones I let go
Unless we live, love
Hate will kill us all
Love and hate
They want me to medicate
Begging me to change my ways
I'm going crazy, going crazy
Yeah I'm going crazy
Love and hate
Only one can take the pain away
Feeling numb I might go Kurt Cobain (bang)
Going crazy, going crazy
