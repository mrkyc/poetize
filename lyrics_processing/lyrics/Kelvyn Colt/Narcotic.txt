(Verse 1)
Pack your stuff
Get your face out
Don't be throwing stones
Sitting in the glass house
Make up sex
We brake up
Next we pass out
Elevated
We Getting hella faded
Don't claim you don't know me
You know my clique "O.E"
Don't make me decide
In between you and my homies
We was good on low key
Now you acting phony
Nosy in my business
Come on babe you ain't the police
SMS and phone calls
Saying say you love me
You might also likeSay my name
Say my name
Show me that you want me
And suddenly it's changed
We don't even kiss the same
Is it product of the sudden fame
That we are caught up in arguing
About the same things
Playing the blame game
Is it worth it
Is we really working
I'm just saying
I was hurt several times
It is hard for me to trust
Still gave you my heart
I'm falling for more than the lust
We the tag team
Brag mean
Forget all the boppers
Swear you are my medicine
You better than a doctor
That's cuz' I trust you
I hope that you don't doubt it
You're my narcotic
If you bout it then I'm bout it
(Hook 1)
Cuz I'm about it
If you're about it
Cuz every time we touching
I feel a narcotic
I said I'm about it
If you're about it
Cuz every time we touching
I feel a narcotic
Only you can numb my pain
Girl come on make me feel again
Cuz I'm about it
If you're about it
And every time we touching I feel a narcotic
(Verse 2)
Ex Girl tripping
New girl stripping
Won't give her dime
Baby told you that I'm different
Boom shakalaka
Baby come change your position
This here ain't a love song
This is a condition
Baby I got an addiction
Colt be crazy need prescription
Maybe ladies trynna' make these babies
Lately I don't listen
I need you in my Kitchen
On my mind when in my bedroom
Maybe I'm a mad man
Maybe we'll be dead soon
To you it's nonsense
You think I'm lacking conscience
Why my girls' beautiful outside
Inside they lack content
Always falling for the same type
Two sleep overs
In the same night
I got what you need
I got what you want
Call me up
I am Kelvyn colt
Men they down me
Women hold me up
Stone cold
Brother
Don't want
Others
You the type
With whom I might
Go home, meet my mother
(Hook 2)
Cuz I'm about it
If you're about it
Cuz every time we touching
I feel a narcotic
I said I'm about it
If you're about it
Cuz every time we touching
I feel a narcotic
Only you can numb my pain
Girl come on make me feel again
Cuz I'm about it
If you're about it
And every time we touching I feel a narcotic
(Verse 3)
I love you but I don't want you
Push you then I hunt you
I will brake you down
And give you someone to look up to
I don't ever answer
Won't reply when you texting me
But always on the phone
When you are right next to me
I'll write when you thought
That you are forgetting me
I'll flash you a call
Yeah that is my recipe
I'm Aphrodite
Send pheromones of narcotics
You stare along when I carry on
Dare on to be about it
I'm your narcotic
(Hook 3)
Cuz I'm about it
If you're about it
Cuz every time we touching
I feel a narcotic
I said I'm about it
If you're about it
Cuz every time we touching
I feel a narcotic
Only you can numb my pain
Girl come on make me feel again
Cuz I'm about it
If you're about it
