Chain swingin', head bangin', this is how I crunk

Ayy, pussy, better step out
Flash light on the strap, bra-bra, then it's black out
I say it on a track, so I can keep it calm
If you don't hear it on a song, then it's quiet before the storm
Yeah, yeah, ayy, you been warned
That's what happens when you let 'em in your heart, it gon' get torn
And I'm not into whinin', I just keep it movin' on
I been through a ego death before and that shit made me strong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't pop pillies
Trippin' of the shrooms, all my goons act silly
R.I.P. to those gone too soon, do you feel me?
I'm channelin' my inner-child and the universe to heal me
Spiritual experience when I rage (Ayy)
Plus I own my catalog, nigga, I ain't no damn slave
Except to my desires, nigga, yes, I got my ways
Gotta hit Rick Owens every time that I get paid
