Mama
I lost my way
I'm almost your age
I've lost my ways
Mama
I lost my way
I'm almost your age
I've lost my ways

Mama, I left home
Path ain't sure, I'm broke again
Can you lend me ten?
Promoter said he got a gig
I sold a pair of Yeezy's
I gon' make my rent this month
Pay you back a little, oh, these days
They don't pay good wage (In London)
I quit my job, my rent behind
But I met a guy, he'll try and get me signed
He seems honest, the most sincere
Since I been in Miami
Oh, I miss my home

But it's getting closer though, I had a meetin'
They didn't want me, had another one
My degree is worthless
But I'm stayin' with O now
It's pretty good on this side of town
My neck cracks. 'cause I crash on his couch
But it's cool, I won't frown

Dear Mama
When you were my age
You had me
So I'll find my way
That's the least I could do
Oh, dear mama
I'll find my way
And I'll come back home
Bring you platinum and gold
That's the least I could do

Mama
I lost my way
I'm almost your age
I lost my ways

Mama, don't you worry I'll be back soon
The world is waiting for me, I'm gon' reach you
Dear mama (Yeah)
When I found my way

You were my age when you had me
Even younger when you went and married daddy
After just three days, dropped on one knee, he said
"I wanna be with you, but only if you keep safe"
Always knew what you wanted
In teenage years was running
From a town and a household that gave you nothing
And yet you hold no grudges, taught me it's so important
To never forget from where you coming
Yet forgive wrongs and to uphold hope and faith
Once in a hopeless place, you told him to his face
You'd rather separate than to abort, that's no mistake
And your eyes are my eyes, we look the same
When you cry, then I ride, do what it takes
And these ain't empty words
And I apologize for every time I left you hurt
I'm just a young man, tryna survive in this crazy world
You had to raise me, scared our troubles would change me
Sacrificed and cut back on your life if it's 'out your baby (Shit)
No one can ever touch your baby
Mama
I lost my way
I'm almost your age
I've lost my ways
Mama
I lost my way
I'm almost your age
I've lost my ways

Mama, don't you worry I'll be back soon
The world is waiting for me, I'm gon' reach you
Dear mama (Yeah)
When I found my way

Mama
I lost my way
I'm almost your age
I've lost my ways
Mama
I lost my way
I'm almost your age
