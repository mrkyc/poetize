(You say that you've healed)
But the trauma isn't over
'Til you've faced the ones you've hurt and apologize for closure
(You say that you real)
All these morals over commerce
Circle full of junkies judgin' folks who on the corner
(Ayy, what is really trill?)
Shoutin' on the streets at protests
Or lookin' out for your community, yet go unnoticed
Many ways to judge a book, yet there is only one to read it
Truth is glaringly objective to the few that dare to see it
Between gang signs and Braille, see what you feel
Nigga, speak what you heard, nigga, eat what you kill
My heaven on earth to you could be hell
For better or worse, whatever it's worth
Let me take you to the rage, all you gotta say is church
You ain't gotta know the details to make it work and function
You just gotta grasp the concept similar to cars, yet
There's a couple laws that are gonna make your ride a breeze
My nigga, just trust it, please

Neuroplasticity
Throw your hands up and say "neuroplasticity" (Google it)

I don't fuck with social justice warriors, to me they tyrants
Woah, I think woke cancel cultures tirin'
Oh, I ain't tryna trigger nobody
Wardrobe full of skeletons, my basement full of bodies
I should run for fuckin' president, but I refuse to walk with parties
Ayy, shawdy, I'm a dissident with precedence
Resistin' the system publicly, ain't no wonder that they depressin' him
Testin' him, global citizen, switch up my residence
I be effin' 'em, could've signed with Geffen then
If I woulda met a Dr. Dre, I be like Eminem
Fuck it, these nuts in my hands, watch me as I do my dance
I don't put this shit on the Gram, guess that I just blew my chance
The day I brought back my masters, they thought that I just ruined the plan
But I made a grand one
I was gettin' high with James Brown's grandson
And he told me that they family don't make no income
Off his catalogue
So I had to switch up, see the bigger picture
