I want to start to dream
I've been up for too long
Finally need sleep
All these stars are an illusion
When I leave
Make sure you keep the keys
You know I'll be back soon
I always came back boo
Whenever I stare into the sky
I start to realize
Whenever I stare into the sky
I start to realize

2016 and I'm mindfucked
22 and I'm tired of illicit means to get by bruv
Yet a 9 to 5 ain't a part of mine
Mama, papa grinding since it 95'
And the government ain't been a friend of our
Matter of fact, fuck the government
ACAB, fuck all of them
Tell em' we scheduling
Pediment upper echelon, not settlement on
Anything below our stakes
Keep the crumbles, want the cake
They call you dumb, you wanting more
Stick and stone might brake the bone
Risking some to gain it all
The pound of flesh to free my soul
Shit, Colt finna bust a clip
At a strip of hypocrit politcs
And when I'm done take a pic
Hang em' up at the crib
Show em all how we live
Make them taste their own medicine
Share the state in that my head has been
Pressure knocking will not let it in
Busy fleeing, getting hella bent

I wanna start to dream, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

I want to start to dream
I've been up for too long
Finally need sleep
All these stars are an illusion
When I leave
Make sure you keep the keys
You know I'll be back soon
I always came back boo
Whenever I stare into the sky
I start to realize
Whenever I stare into the sky
I start to realize

Ain't nothing but dreams matter
Heard wolf appear, saw sheep scatter
They lacking cause to believing
Society told em', it don't need them
World has made them feel worthless
I've been there and it hurts yet
Man I just stood up again
In lyrical sense, man pull out the Skeng
Bust up da ting then run up on them
Hollow tips drop for shallow mandem
Our call upon this Mother Earth
Wasn't to become the one to serve
Never ever will I ever let them hurt
Undermine what I define my worth
I won't sign this bullshit
And I can't sign up this shift
Got plenty plans of my own
That you ain't even yet know
Way beyond your headspace
Can't stay in this dead place
No room here, improvement wise
And if I fail, at least I tried
I want to start to dream
I've been up for too long
Finally need sleep
All these stars are an illusion
When I leave
Make sure you keep the keys
You know I'll be back soon
I always came back boo
Whenever I stare into the sky
I start to realize
Whenever I stare into the sky
I start to realize

Whenever I stare into the sky
I start to realize
Whenever I stare into the sky
I start to realize
That nothing but my dreams matter
Yeah
