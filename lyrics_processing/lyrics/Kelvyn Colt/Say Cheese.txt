I was stressed out, capiche?
But I'm blessed now, jhee'
Got bands now, that's cheese
My lifestyle, that's ease
Jesus, my priest
Features, no need

Say cheese, say cheese

I ain't into takin' pictures with you niggas, motherfuckers look suspicious (Huh)
I be waitin' nice 'til I pull up with guys that's mean mugging, yeah they vicious, huh
Treat my woman like a queen, huh, I ain't into fucking bitches, huh
Dick engrained, head of change 'cause the change in my heart, I carry riches, ya

I'm somewhere between being like Nino and like Gandhi
I'm killing all my opps with kindness, learned that from my auntie
I'm auntie, I mean anti
Don't want a handout, but my hands tied
Break a arm and a leg when my band's live
I'm just out here livin' my best life

Raise the four door, I grab the coupe
I'm at the Waldorf, jump off the roof
I'm with my dogs out there, I'll go woof
I heard that dreams come true, I'm the proof
They want beef with, bring the troops
They ain't gon' sing with, they will shoot
Guess you can't reason with the fool
So they don't like me, fuck they gon' do, huh?

Say cheese, but I don't wanna, huh
Buds small like marijuana, huh
Got phones but they don't holla, huh
Cut them off like Benihana, huh
Hanukkah, this song get lit
Second generation, I'm an immigrant
Reparations know, yeah, I'm sick of them
Get that vaccine on, I'm throwin' 'em jabs
They wanna be peaceful, but they all ask
Power to the people, can't change the past
Pipe a power pussy could have had a blast
'Cause I wrote a smash, but it made me mad

Percocet, I can't pop a pill
Gotta manifest
Yeah, I can't rest 'til I have fullfilled
What my purpose is (Yeah)
