Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh
Jumpa, make it jump

I'd rather be broke than famous
Rather be broke than famous
Sellin' my soul for changes
Better than sellin' out stages if that means
To sell my soul (My soul)
In exchange to gain it all (It all)
I'd rather be broke than famous
Rather be broke than famous

Okay, came to the city with a dollar and a dream
Had to find out that everything ain't what it seams
Starlights had a young boy goin' blind
It's like every time I rhyme, all they see is dollar signs
I be out here on the grind, prayin' one day they gon' find me
All my shit go viral, motherfuckers wanna sign me
Baby, I was home, there's not a whole city behind me
Flip two Ls into a W and call that origami, ja

I think they knew that I was starvin', mm
They kept on callin'
But a deal with the devil ain't a bargain, mm
I beg your pardon (Yeah, yeah)

I'd rather be a misfit, I'd rather be a dreamer
Rather be a reject, rather be a leader
Than to be a part of this shit that you call industry now
Heard on the other side, the grass is always greener
Indies won't get in, stars wanna get out
Everybody want what they don't have and that's what this about
One day you'll be up on cloud nine, next you're fallin' down
Time is the only one who gon' decide who makes it out
