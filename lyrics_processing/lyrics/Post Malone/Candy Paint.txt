Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top (Skrrt)
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (Drop)
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot (Pop)

Half price my whip, same price my watch (Bling)
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot (Swish)
