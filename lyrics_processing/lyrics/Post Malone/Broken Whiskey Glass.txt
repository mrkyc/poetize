I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 is like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next, man, only time will tell

Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh

I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits, so I'm fuckin' your bitch (Ooh)
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker, talk saucy
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker, let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothes
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly, but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grilly
I do this for realy and for my family
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y
The bitches, they killin' me
Like, bitch, are you kiddin' me?
Ballin', that shit Jason Kidd to me
You can't get rid of me
Yeah, you want my chain and my chi
Bitch, I'm real good at chemistry
