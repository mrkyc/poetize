I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night?
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night

My necklace had a natural glow
She dancin' in the strobe
Let's fuckin' spoil my night (Spoil my night)
Spent so much cash, I lost her
My cup was too toxic
I took the robe off (Yeah)
I couldn't get her off me
Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life

Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? (Spoil my night)
