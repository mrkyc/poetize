Don't wanna sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"
Don't wanna sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus

I just left Wally's, spent a Maserati
The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates
I call my quote-unquote friends, "Do you got plans?"
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons, it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot

Don't wanna sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"
Don't wanna sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus

Who am I talkin' to? Nobody
Take me outside, I'm a little too high
Paid a little too much for the time of my life
When money ain't a problem, everyone's lyin'
Even when I tell myself that I

Don't wanna sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"
Don't wanna sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it
Thought I was strong enough
