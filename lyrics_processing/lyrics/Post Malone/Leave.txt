Oh-oh-oh-oh

She said, "Love me" so I love her (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
She said, "Leave me" so I left (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Then I went to California (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I ain't never comin' back
I got a high five from a brother (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I got bloodstains on the bed (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I ain't sayin' that I love her (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)

You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)

I worship since I met you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I fell down to my knees (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And when no one would accept ya (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Throw myself up on a cross and bleed
I seen a dark cloud coming over (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I seen some evil shit in her head (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But she rode me like no other (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
