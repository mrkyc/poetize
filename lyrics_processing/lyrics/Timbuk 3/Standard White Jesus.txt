Baby, boom go bum
Baby, boom, go straight to the edge
And someone hollers "jump!"
You've got to be dead to be bigger than life
But everyone's afraid to fly
Everyone wants to be on a postage stamp
But nobody wants to die
Better bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
Bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
Bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
And read the letters that the children write
To the Standard White Santa Claus
They want flash;
Something awesome
Something with a little kick
Something Semi-
Automatic
Just might do the trick
You might also likeThey want weapons
To arm themselves
Against every childhood fear
They want rockets
To fly up to heaven
And get the hell out of here
See the devils
And the angels
See how shamelessly they dance
Defying the laws of gravity
On the shoulders of romance\
The sensations
The temptations
Our forefathers have succumbed to
And the bitter-
Sweet fragrance
Our noses have been numbed to
Bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
Bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
Bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
And read the letters that the children write
To the Standard White Santa Claus
(Bow, bow down)
How grim
Our lives would be
If not for children's laughter
Like scary
Old fairy tales
With no happily ever after
Talking on telephones
Cross time zones
Paying the futility bill
Praying for rain
Punching clocks
Changing the world like I change my socks
Bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
Bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
Bow down
To the Standard White Jesus on the cross
And read the letters that the children write
To the Standard White Santa Claus
And read the letters that the children write
