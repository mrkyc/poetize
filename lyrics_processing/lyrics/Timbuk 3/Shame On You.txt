Shame on you, shame on you
You've always taken life in massive doses
Back when you were a child they said you were precocious
You were always doing something that you shouldn't ought to do
And you never did the things that were expected of you
In school you were a troublemaker, always getting caught
Staying up on all the things the teachers never taught
Well, you've got a lot of nerve acting the way you do
You know, something's going to bring a lot of shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
Man, you could have had power and a hot position
Like a hotshot lawyer or a bigshot politician
You could have been the head of a major corporation
Instead you're working part time at a filling station
Doing comedy on the side -- you're really quite funny
But dude, don't you know you could be making big money?
Shame on you -- you haven't got a dime
Shame on you -- for having such a good time
Shame on you -- you're a disgrace to everyone
Shame on you -- you're having too much fun
Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you
Well, I remember that producer down in Hollywood
Who came to hear you play, and said you were good
It was your one big break --
If you only would have played your cards a little smarter
By now you'd have it made -- your own tv show, or recording contract!
And all you had to do was lighten up your act!
A stairway to the stars -- a one-way ticket
But you, you had to go and tell him where he could stick it
Shame on you -- you could have been on tv
Shame on you -- you have too much integrity
Shame on you -- you should have kept the door open
Shame on you -- you're just too outspoken
Shame on you -- you haven't got a dime
Shame on you -- for having such a good time
Shame on you -- you're a disgrace to everyone
Shame on you -- you're having too much fun
Shame on you -- you're having too much fun
