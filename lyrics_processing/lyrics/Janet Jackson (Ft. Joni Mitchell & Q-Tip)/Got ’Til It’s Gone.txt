What's, what's the next song?
The one about me
Oh, yeah, I like this one
Uh, uh, like Joni says

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishing, thinking, dreaming 'bout you, and the love
How'd I ever let you get away?

Don't it always seem
Don't it always seem
Don't it always seem
Don't it always seem

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Joni Mitchell never lies
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games

Got 'til it's gone
Got 'til it's gone
Joni Mitchell never lies
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til
One-two, one-two, yo
Let me just fuck with it for a minute, what
(That you don't what you've got til it's gone)
Now you realizing when them nights go long, right?
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I'm gone, right?
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was working round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide but my love you impeach
Now you looking at the walls, head in hands, cold jonesin'
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing

And why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that, huh?
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh?
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that?

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Joni Mitchell never lies
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Yo, do you feel that?
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
