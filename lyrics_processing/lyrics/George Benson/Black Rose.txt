Born to Cuban descendants
Young, Black, cool, independent
And everybody likes to call her Harlem's Rose
I fell in love from the first glance
She was the definition of romance
Must be a hole in Heaven way up in the skies

We started hanging out together day and night
Body was bangin', caliente, so tight
We caught a vibe so strong
I never should have done her wrong
Now I want you back

And I remember how she used to lay
After the love, all the games we played
Lied to a friend, love's at an end
My Heaven is gone
So I cry a little more each night
Because I'm never gonna hold you tight
Amor, come back to me, Rosita La Negra
Black Rose, la negra
Black Rose
You might also like
As the wind blows the willows
I can still see her face by my pillow
With every tear drop, I almost feel her in my arms
In my arms
My head keeps on pounding
I can't help stop the sound of
The rain above (The cry of love)
Can't look in the mirror 'cause nothing is clearer
Than guilty eyes full of lies

We started hanging out together day and night
(We started hanging out)
Body was bangin', caliente, so tight
We caught a vibe so strong
I never should have done her wrong
Now I want you back

And I remember how she used to lay
After the love, all the games we played
Lied to a friend, love's at an end
My Heaven is gone
So I cry a little more each night
Because I'm never gonna hold you tight
Amor, come back to me, Rosita La Negra
Not a color in the rainbow
(Black is so beautiful to me)
A velvet flower in the garden
(Wish Heaven would send her back to me)
Just give me the chance and I'll make it right
Girl, I swear
Black Rose


And I remember how she used to lay
After the love, all the games we played
(The games we played)
Lied to a friend, love's at an end
My Heaven is gone
So I cry a little more each night
Because I'm never gonna hold you tight
Amor, come back to me, Rosita La Negra
Black Rose, la negra
Black Rose

And I remember how she used to lay
After the love, all the games we played
Lied to a friend, love's at an end
My Heaven is gone
So I cry a little more each night
Because I'm never gonna hold you tight
Amor, come back to me, Rosita La Negra
