Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues and hit the city lights

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night (Give me, give me)
(Alright, tonight)
Gimme the night (Give me, give me)
(Every night)

You need the evening action (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
You'll see the people of the world coming out to dance

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night (Give me, give me)
