Oh, what a night
Now don't you feel like flyin'
Everything's right
You can't blame me for tryin'
Love, look up there
The stars are all aligned
Now don't you think it's time? Ho, ho, ho
Closer to me
I want to feel your breathing permanently
'Cause darling, I'm not leaving here
'Til I get what I've been waiting for
Some twenty-five or more
That's all I need, oh

Kisses in the moonlight, sugar
That would make this night complete
There have got to be
Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
Fly away with me, oh, oh, oh

Most of our days
We get so busy runnin'
Lost in a maze
We've got no time for fun and dreams
But every now and then a dream is real
And this is how it feels, yeah, yeah, yeah
For once in your life
Forget about tomorrow
Tonight is the night
Our worries seems so far away
You hold me in your arms so tenderly
I only want a taste of your sweet, sweet, ooh
You might also like
Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
That would make this night complete
There have got to be
Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
Fly away with me
Oh, fly away with me

Don't let this night end right now
In your arms is where I need to be
Please, oh lady
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Kisses in the moonlight
And you know, and you know that I know, woo
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh yeah, yeah, ooh yeah, baby

Oh, kisses in the moonlight, hey
That would make this night complete
There have got to be
Oh, kisses in the moonlight, sugar
Fly away with me, hey
Oh, kisses in the moonlight
(Kisses in the moonlight, oh baby, oh)
Oh, kisses in the moonlight
Oh, kisses in the moonlight
(The moonlight, oh-oh, oh-oh, doo-doo-doo-hoo-hoo)
Oh, kisses in the moonlight
(Oh baby, kisses in the moonlight, kisses in the moonlight
