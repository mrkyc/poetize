There I go, there I go, there I go
There I go
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time I'm near you
I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
Music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turns me your slave
Come and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything baby, just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies
How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby, come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?

So tell me why stop to think
About this weather, my dear?
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby
You might also like
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh, my baby
Won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery?

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet?
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me?
Come on and please pull yourself together
Better do it very soon
My hearts's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh, pretty baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a loving state of mind
I'm so crazy about love
Never knowing what love's all about
James Moody, you come on in man
You can blow now if you want to
