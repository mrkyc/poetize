Let's do it again, do it again
Play it again
Play it, judge it
Play it again, play it again
Let's do it again, play it again
Play it, judge it
Do it again, play it again

Sometimes the rain
Groovin' when I hear the sounds
Like you and me, baby
Gettin' down with the sounds around
Oh, the smell of the morning flowers
As we pass away the hours
I wanna do it again, do it again
Do it, do it

I like to play it in the morning
Sweet breeze in the summertime
Feeling your sweet face
Right up next to mine
I'm gonna play it 'til midnight
Then sleep 'til the morning light
Don't worry 'bout nothin'
Just feelin' good, just feelin' good
Feelin' good about love
You might also like
Do it again, play it again
Play it, judge it
Do it again, play it again

Now, I like you, lady
So fine with your pretty hair
If you don't mind my compliment
Just diggin' on the clothes you wear
I'm just a man, now don't you fear
I can love you now, don't you hear?
I wanna do it again
Do it again, do it, do, do, do it

Let's do it again, play it again
Play it, judge it
Do it again, play it again
Let's do it again, play it again
Play it, judge it
Do it again, play it again

Like a hammer on a clock
You and me, we gonna rock
Gonna make you feel love and pride
Feel good and satisfied
You're not a girl that will linger
Oh, and I'm not a butterfinger
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again, do it again (Do it again)
Do it, do it, do it, oh, oh yeah
We play it in the morning
Sweet breeze in the summertime
When I feel your face
Right up next to mine
We play it 'til the midnight
Then sleep 'til the morning light
Don't worry 'bout nothin'
Just feelin' good, just feelin' good
Feelin' good about love, yeah

Do it again, play it again
Let's do it again, play it again
Play it, judge it
Do it again, play it again
Woo-hoo-ooh


Let's do it again, play it again
Play it, judge it
Do it again, play it again
Woo-hoo-ooh
Let's do it again, play it again
Play it, judge it
Do it again, play it again
Woo-hoo-ooh
