Remember the days when we never had a dime
And our dreams seemed a million miles away
But we made it, baby
Facin' the bad times with a smile
Here we are, and we're growin' stronger day by day

'Cause we got love times love (Good times)
It's always there for us to share
And girl, it sure feels good (So good)
To know you're by my side
'Cause we're just two high hearts (High hearts)
That beat as one forever on
With love times love (Good times)
To keep us satisfied every night

So my lady, whisper the words I love to hear
Cuddle up and I'll make you feel all right
'Cause I need you, baby, to carry me on through all the years
So come on, baby, close the door and dim the lights

'Cause we got love times love (Good times)
It's always there for us to share
And girl, it sure feels good (So good)
To know you're by my side
'Cause we're just two high hearts (High hearts)
That beat as one forever on
With love times love (Good times)
To keep us satisfied every night
You might also like
And there ain't no one in this world tonight
Could change my point of view
So come on, girl, and hold me tight
The way you always do
With love times me and you

'Cause we got love times love (Good times)
It's always there for us to share
And girl, it sure feels good (So good)
To know you're by my side
'Cause we're just two high hearts (High hearts)
That beat as one forever on
With love times love (Good times)
To keep us satisfied

(Love times love, good times)
We got love (Always for sharing)
(Sure feels good)
It sure feels good to know
(To know you're with me)
(Two high hearts, high hearts)
Carried me on throughout the years
(As one, forever)
(Love times love, good times)
Keep me satisfied
(Love times love, good times always for sharing)
'Cause we got love
(Sure feels good)
