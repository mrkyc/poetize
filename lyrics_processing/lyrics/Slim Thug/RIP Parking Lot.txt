You know what I'm saying?
We just on some H town, Texas shit, that's all
So, our City
Daddy Houston

I'm in the Cadillac, with my bling on
Pinky ring on, my whole team on
And we on this throne, I'm talking King Kong
Spit game, so cold, I need a mink on
Ha, rest in peace to the parking lot
It's a quarter mil, sitting in my parking spot, hey
Grew up on that cash money so I stunt a lot
This my Sunday car, this ain't the only one I got
Say lil' momma come roll with a real nigga
Roll a fatty while you roll with a real nigga
Hit it all night, next day you still with her. we good
If you could roll a good J, I can chill with ya'
Thugga

Rest in peace to the parking lot
It's a quarter mil, sitting in my parking spot
Grew up on that cash money so I stunt a lot
This my Sunday car, this ain't the only one I got
Rest in peace to the parking lot
It's the cleanest slab sitting in my parking spot
Grew up on that S.U.C so I swang a lot
This my Sunday car, this ain't the only slab I got

Rest in peace to the parking lot
Texan Wire Wheels partner, I don't ride stock
Bass knock, banging Screw chopped 2Pac
If you think I'm thinking 'bout you, I think not
Fresh fit, fresh kicks and a phat knot
Panoramic roof open to air out the pot
Wood grain, matching Rollie no tip top
Full of rocks and you can bet that I keep the Glock
With one cocked
So keep my name out your jacking plot
When you riding clean all the boppers bound to flock
And when you kiling boys, guaranteed the haters not
If you looking for me I'll be dripping candy with the trunk popped
Rest in peace

Rest in peace to the parking lot
It's a quarter mil, sitting in my parking spot
Grew up on that cash money so I stunt a lot
This my Sunday car, this ain't the only one I got
Rest in peace to the parking lot
It's a candy slab sitting in my parking spot
Grew up on that S.U.C so I swang a lot
This my Friday car, this ain't the only one I got
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
One time for them slab riders (slab riders)
Moving through the motherfuckin' city looking good
