Welcome to Houston

Big city in the Country State
Say we the fattest 'cuz the food here taste great
Steak and lobster for brunch, I like big meals
See the oldschool caddies with the big wheels
Headed to see the Texans and the dropdome
Put out the weed, ain't no telling what them cops on
By the time this dropped my nigga Shotty got home
Hit the superbowl smelling like a pound of strong
Looking like King Kong when you see me
Paid the cost, being the boss ain't easy
Might be courtside on ya tv
Same night, at the local bar, chilling with a star

Hopped the bar from the city of the purple
Shooting for the stars, and you ain't nowhere near my circle
Anytime I'm out they think I'm shooting a commercial
The top go in the trunk, and all the doors go in reversal
Made it off my hustle, now a limo just a long car
Call me Michael Knight, conversating with my own car
Show up fresh to death, my preachers seen me and said "oh Lawd"
Space Jams on me like I got 'em off a 
Great tape collector, I got Screw all in my mindframe
Diamonds on the bezel, 360 where the time hang
Park it in the front the rims stretch out in the driveway
Foreigns hit the block and change colors on the highway
100 dollar Nikes on, money-grip python
Diamonds shine like MGM like you think the fight's on
Mobbin' thru the west, turning wheel without no lights on
They love in the mall, I'm a grocery store icon
Linked-up with the Boss, now I'm feeling like an outlaw
PJ in that  back when they were yelling "Boss Hog!"
Texas independent, labels we did it without y'all
Leaning sideways when sitting in the Southpaw
Call me E.S.G. on that instrumental
Everytime they playin' "Ghetto Dreams" man I get sentimental
Legendary status, only do it if it's monumental
Wanna take my spot, but you ain't got it in you
You might also like
Look, slow down is how we rockin' nigga
Glocks extended, all black like a five percenter
Wet paint, a lotta ice but got the hottest winters
Come around this bitch without that flex and get yo pockets thinner
Pro'
A lot of Pimp and Tupac up in 'em
Baddest broads, fuck the same girls as all the Rocket members
My nigga Murda stuff a hundred pounds inside the 
Sent it out of town and have that money back in time for dinner
It's Hustle Town, you gettin' paid 
Rose up out the gutter partna, we ain't have a pot to piss in
Fuck the laws, every time we seen 'em we was hopping fences
Banging Z-Ro, we was broke just trying to plot the millions
Lil' mama say she hate it when I rap the struggle
I come from nothing but she love it when 
Or how I turned Forever Trill into a couple hundreds
Young niggas, trying to stack some more and go fuck up the summer
Shit, we came from watching Paul and Thugga
Big Bentleys, wasn't no rented cars up under them covers
, drank was color purple, Danny Glover
Rest in peace to DJ Screw, I hope I'm doing them southies justice

Reportin' live from them trenches, same city J. Prince is
Sippin' purple rain like Prince's, might pull-up 
Keep codeine in my kidneys, my jewelry's worth two Bentleys
That's a Mulsanne, I'm Usain, for the loose change I'm sprintin'
, get the sack like Watt
Catching plays like Hop
This ain't Love & Hip Hop
I ain't 
Get the guac' cause I'm hot, y'all counting me out
Real nigga they bop, fake nigga I'm not
I don't speak to no cops, I'm in the streets with them knots
I keep a miracle watch, I keep it lyrical tho
H-Town like it slow, in the Caddy sittin' low
Vogues wrap the '84
Ball like I'm goin' pro
Red bottoms on my toe
Red candy on my door
Red drank, pour a four
Leanin' listenin' to Moe (yeah!)
Muddy muddy I'm the Barre Baby
Pat and H.A.W.K. reincarnated
I'm the shit you get when you mix the Robert Davis
Earl up with Scarfaces
Legendary that 70's smokin' rappers like a blunt  lit
Glass-set out the 80's, Cadillac from the 70's

Too much money in the city
Er'body got a hustle, if you want it you gotta see it boy
Yeah
I flipped the brim on my fitted, throw my deuce out the ceilin'
This is really how I'm feelin mane
Bitch nigga get no convo
Nah player that ain't Act, that's that almost
Boy you tryna leave a print round my styrofoam?
This shit up and down like the Dow Jones
Hit the milestone, I'm just running 'til my knees poppin'
These boys ain't hustlin', they just eavesdroppin'
Niggas waiting on the call, I guess he's floppin'
Man I'm killin' so much shit, I'mma 
Stop it
I'm just hoping that they reset me
Keep stepping on them haters, I can't respect them
Boss-like sneakers looking like some Giuseppe's
Thugger showed me 
Real niggas get a check for the superbowl
Supercoupe, four doors, that's a Uber though
Paul Wall stay down 
Don't pull up in traffic, we leave you mortified
Ghosts and Bentleys sittin' 
Apologize, for all the drugs glorified
Welcome to Houston nigga, I am ya tourguide
Welcome to Houston, where we hustle 'till we pass out
And all the bitches' booties look like they was born with ass-shots
Run with them bulls, but I ain't talking 'bout no mascots
So come into my city acting silly and get your ass shot
They stole the culture the first time that they came around it
And you not a real drank-sipper just 'cuz you hang around it
You outta-towners don't know a thing about it
But this is Houston where trunks knocking and blades choppin' like Lorena Bobbitt
The haters doubt it, but we made it out as the main attraction
And I bet someone from Houston influenced your favorite rapper
Then made it faster than someone that's from the city
So excuse me for this chip on my shoulder I carry with me
I'm rapping like I got a point to prove, it's time for boys to move
Gave the city my whole life and I just can't afford to lose
Pick or choose, pay the player, build a buzz by paying dues
And if you don't pay attention, you fuck around and make the news
Cause you can't snooze all these jackers 'round here
City full of cheeseheads but ain't no 'Packers round here
Niggas quick to shoot them clips but ain't no actors 'round here
So disrespect and you gon' end up target practice 'round here
Down here in Houston, Texas it's best that you just respect us
But don't be too friendly, because a nigga will take yo necklace
Your best bet is the valet because a nigga will take yo Lexus
And then go pull up at a chop-shop and get broke off by some Mexicans
See, I ain't tryna harm you, really I'm just tryna warn you
We got them sunny days,  but you are not in California
And this ain't Hollywood, so if you thinkin' that you good
A nigga will pistol-whip you in the parking lot, just like he should
