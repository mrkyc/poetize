I be puffin' blunts in the house, hittin' stunts on the couch
This year, crazy cats gon' get punched in they mouth
When your wife see me, she don't know how to act
So don't be mad when I blow out her back, for real
Your whole crew's a bunch of poo-butts
Made a few bucks, date a few sluts
Then y'all started runnin' your lips a little too much
Got chedda to blow, pockets never get low
Chickens sweat me wherever I go
Me and O.C. be in the Lex
Cartier specs, Nautica sweats, Gore-Tex
With Presidentials on, full of baguettes
I done sold coke, sold crack, sold smoke, sold smack
Now I want a gold plaque, can I get a soul clap?
Some cats be cold wack
You got the lye? Well, brother, roll that!
And if it won't get me high, then hold that!
I'mma cop me a 6, and cruise through the block with your trick
I'mma keep droppin' them hits, it won't stop 'til I'm rich

Any mic I hold in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd, dictatin' shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic
Scoldin', bringin' somatic to this rap shit
Bona fide mic set, you can't see me on it
Master the art, so now I just flaunt it
Born to live a life and die, but 'til then
I'mma keep on writin' slick rhymes with the pen
I take the cherry from a beat like a virgin havin' innocent
Bust my nut, bring rhyme to life like Genesis
Poetical renaissance, endeavors are flawless
Tearin' it up when it comes to me pickin' up this cordless
One of New York's finest
On this trip, I coincide with Beatminerz
Bringin' out the best in me
We formulatin' like a recipe
Water and dough, we sho' 'nuff
Bestow my presence
Then I'm divine like the seven
Keepin' it tight, 'cause what I suffice is raw, nigga
It's only right
You might also like
Like that, y'all

It's like that, y'all

On the Blackout Rap show, with my man Phat Phillie
Check it out, uhh
We about to get into a verse like this
Check me out, y'all

Hmm-mmm

Yeah, yeah!
A couple of years ago, before the year '9-fo'
My cash flow was low, I was low on dough
Used to try to talk to fly girls, and they was like "No!"
I knew that all of that'd change once I started to blow
Now my pockets are bloated because I exploded
Stayed devoted, dropped a hot album, now I'm loaded
I hang with fly stars, buy cars for fifty-thou'
The New York City child, thug with a pretty smile
I love this rap game, that's why I married it
It's a big load, but somebody gots to carry it
At one point, I was about to give up
Then got offered a record deal, and my eyes lit up
In 1992, boo, my dream came true
First I got the fame, then the cream came through
Word up, I used to rhyme all the time
Whoever thought that slim kid from 139'd shine down the line, huh?
I used to sell cracks, now I sell tracks
Listen up 'cause when L raps, he tell facts
I'm the type of cat to lay wack MC's to rest
I was told to work hard to achieve success
Words of wisdom from my father
He said, "L, when things ain't goin' so well, don't give up, try harder"
And never be afraid to make mistakes
And don't spend your cash foolishly, save your papes
'Cause good things come to those who wait they turn
Stay concerned, 'cause it's a lot of papes to earn
And help those that's less fortunate than you
And stay true to whatever you do, until you're through
Yo, uhh
O.C.'s illin', I will never, ever bore you
O.C.'s illin', I will never, ever bore you
To rock like I do, it takes certain zest
I'm truly untouchable, like Elliot Ness
See, my word and verse is fly, one moment tranquil
Then the next minute it goes with the strength to kill
I can rock a party right, all night, just trust me
Not an MC out there who can touch me
Anywhere I go, young ladies, they rush me
When I'm on the mic, no way in hell you can hush me
My mere presence will leave you in awe
And when I'm through, you too will call me pah-pah
Now is the time to settle this vendetta
Slicin' MC's like a Swiss cheese shredda
If you don't like Swiss, then I cut you like chedda
Thick, slow and quick, great pain it will inflict
The beat's on time and the cuts all click
Elegant, never meant, I lust to invent
If you heard me say I rock, this is what I meant
I don't shriek, I speak, I could never be weak
I got the crowd overwhelmed with my rap mystique
I'm shrewd, never booed, I wear the MC crown
When I step in the place, MC's, they bow down
Suckas I will smash, they're not fit for the class
Yo, when we get on the mic, they break out like a rash
'Cause my sonic, atomic MC's get moronic
Chillin' with Big L, we like: It's bionic
Charismatic, emphatic, bass has no static
Strungin' off the rhyme like a cocaine addict
Nothin' but cheers, call O.C. the leader
Def rhyme writer, fake MC defeater
Girlfriend said you're sweet, but I'm sweeter
I'll slay any MC in this rappin' arena
Colossal, not a fossil, MC's are quite docile
Teach what I'm preachin', you can call me an apostle
Tall, not short, dog, and this is the sport
I'm a soldier with the mic, and I'm guardin' my fort
And MC's are no bigger than my big toe
And I get higher rating than The Cosby Show
When I recite my rhyme, just for you, my friend
Big L, jump on this mic and flow once again
Yo, it's L the Harlem..
Check it out, bust it
Yo, it's L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady, and that's ill
Playa hatas be givin' me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks
Forget 'em all
Yo, it's L the Harlem pimp, baby, just like I said
Right now, I'm goin' off the top of the head
It's me and O.C., we be low-key
Chillin' in the cribs, iced-out Roley
Chillin' with my man, his name is Phat Phillie
I'm about to get illy, L is a willy
The Blackout Rap Show
I'm cool like my man, Fat Joe
Chew MC's like tobacco
O.C

Who's the fatso? No, not O
MC pro-rap, I can rip the show
With my man Big L, that's right, we representin'
Name is O.C., I'll put my foot indent in
Inside your butt like a slut on the call
MC war, mics I storm
My man Big E is on the back of the side
MC's, pull away before I crash your ride

Check it out, check it out
O.C. I got your back, bro

I got your back

And we chillin' on the show called the Blackout Rap show
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
O.C. and L could never be wack y'all
Check it out, every time I flow it's a sensation
Check it out, like

Live motivation!

Uhh! Yeah, cuttin' MCs like Jason

What? We bring the ill ???

I'mma set it off, then you gonna set it off next

One-two, watch how we flex

Uhh, it's like that, y'all
It's like that, y'all

Right now, we tourin' all over the world

MC's, just dissin' your girl

Right now, we gonna make this the very last line

Sucka MC's, O and L is on time
