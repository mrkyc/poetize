I drop in with my face to the wind, spin one eighty for the win
But I can't find my feet, it's like I lost the beat
Mid-air and there's no plan B's, hit the streets
Look before I leap again
Skeleton filled with adrenaline
How can I know that I got what it takes?
When I've come so far, through the rain, bear the pain
Makes no difference now
Face myself or get taken out
One more time, got to live this loud
Back to the wall, no turnin' around

It's too late it's my fate
I can't turn around
There's no fear in the mirror
To hold me down
I'm too far from the start
Now I'm in too deep
I've got to stick to the plan
('Cause there's) No plan B
No turnin' back (No plan B)
There's no other path (No plan B)
And I know that this road is my destiny
I've got to stick to the plan
('Cause there's) No plan B
You might also like
My life is so curious
I saw all the pictures trap me up
I was betrayed by everything
I tell the story of my life
My voice will stick it in and then bleed it out
I lost it all
You chase the other way
(I) Won't you chase now?
(Stop) Plannin' every move
No turnin' back, no fakin' out
No place to go, my destiny

It's too late it's my fate
I can't turn around
There's no fear in the mirror
To hold me down (This is your time)
I'm too far from the start
Now I'm in too deep (Don't look away)
I've got to stick to the plan
('Cause there's) No plan B
No turnin' back (This is the outside)
There's no other path (No one to trip me down)
And I know that this road is my destiny
I've got to stick to the plan
('Cause there's) No plan B
(All I know is I can't turn back)
(All I know is I can't turn back)
(Got to leave it in the past)
(Got to leave it in the past)
(All I know is I can't turn back)
(All I know is I can't turn back)
(Got to leave it in the past)
(Got to leave it in the past)
'Cause this is the only road I've ever known (You're killing yourself)
There's no way that I could start again, again (Yeah)

It's too late it's my fate
I can't turn around
There's no fear in the mirror
To hold me down (This is your time)
I'm too far from the start
Now I'm in too deep (Don't look away)
I've got to stick to the plan
('Cause there's) No plan B
No turnin' back (This is the outside)
There's no other path (No one to trip me down)
And I know that this road is my destiny
I've got to stick to the plan
