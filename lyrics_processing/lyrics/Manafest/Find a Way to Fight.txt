Fight!
Go!

They say the storm is coming
Everybody's running cause it's set in stones
Rising from the ashes
The clouds are rolling over and it won't be long
I said it won't be long

We won't stop till we win the war
We're gonna stand all through the night
We're gonna get what we came here for
We're gonna find a way to fight
Let's go!

Now the world is burning
They say the tide is turning and we're almost home
War is not the answer
But sometimes it's the answer when it's all gone wrong
I said it's all gone wrong

We won't stop till we win the war
We're gonna stand all through the night
We're gonna get what we came here for
We're gonna find a way to fight

Get up, get up
If the walls burn down (you gotta)
Get up, get up and rise
Get up, get up
They can't stop us now
Get up, get up and fight

They standing in our way
They holding us down
They living in a cage
But we're getting out
Broken all the chains
Then survive the fall
They can try to take us out
But they can't dig us up
But they can't dig us up

Get up, get up
If the walls burn down (you gotta)
Get up, get up and rise (you, you gotta)
Get up, get up
They can't stop us now (you gotta)
Get up, get up and fight
We won't stop till we win the war
We're gonna stand all through the night
We're gonna get what we came here for
We're gonna find a way to fight

Get up, get up
If the walls burn down (you gotta)
Get up, get up and rise
Get up, get up
They can't stop us now (you gotta)
Get up, get up and fight (you gotta)

Get up, get up and fight (you gotta)
Get up, get up and fight (we're gonna)
