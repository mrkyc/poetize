E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
My life, yeah

Last dollar just got spent, first of the month comes
Got to pay rent, where'd the money go
Slipping through my hands
I'm working with these hands
Little Johnny needs a lunch box
Little Suzy needs clothes and it won't stop
Banks calling us up and they don't care
It's more than I can bare

I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine

I, I'm at the edge of my life
I got no time to think twice
When I'm standing with the weight
Of the world on my shoulders
I, I'm gonna fight the good fight
Cause I, I know I'll get by
When I battle everyday
Through the pain like a soldier

E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
My life

Mom crying on the sofa
Dad comes home but he's not sober
Where'd the family go up in smoke again
Feels just like sinking sand
Heard shouts in the backyard (Hey!)
Sirens ringing from a cop car
It's a rough day for this family man
I'm praying with these hands
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine

I, I'm at the edge of my life
I got no time to think twice
When I'm standing with the weight
Of the world on my shoulders
I, I'm gonna fight the good fight
Cause I, I know I'll get by
When I battle everyday
Through the pain like a soldier

E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
My life (Standing on the edge of my life)
Just don't look down
And you'll never fall

I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine
I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve

I, I'm at the edge of my life
I got no time to think twice
When I'm standing with the weight
Of the world on my shoulders
I, I'm gonna fight the good fight
Cause I, I know I'll get by
When I battle everyday
Through the pain like a soldier

E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
My life
E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
E-e-e-edge of my life
My life
