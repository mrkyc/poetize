We underestimate what we're capable of
This is not the end
C'mon
This is not the end nah
Stalemate
Dealing with some dirt  now
Vacate before I have a meltdown
You breed hate
We've breathed and then we passed out

I'm a hustler, hustler, baby, you disgust wanna cuss you off my TV
From the dust back to dust
Your trust is fading
What the?!
One time alright
Two times you lied
Third time you tried (Gotta try)
It's time we rise
Full clip, pull trig
It's the climate we live
Counterfeits
Zig-zagging and split
I'm holding on to holiness
Martyr me if it fits
You're not scaring me a bit, I won't quit
You might also like
This is not the end
It's a place where we begin
In every war we fight, we fall, we bleed, we rise again
But this is not the end
When the walls are closing in
We won't run away
We'll shape the world and start again
But this is not the end

Yeah, c'mon, turn it up
Dead weight
Paid to get the lies round
Predicate in vein
Get the smackdown
I hate and aim
Like a bloodhound
Voice of faith
Wait...
Never sell out

I'm a hustler, hustler, baby
You disgust wanna cuss you off my TV
From the dust back to dust
Your trust is fading
What the?!
I'm a hustler
This is not the end
It's a place where we begin
In every war we fight, we fall, we bleed, we rise again
But this is not the end
When the walls are closing in
We won't run away
We'll shape the world and start again
But this is not the end

We are the giants
We won't be silent
Who will arise, to shine, to fight to make it right
We are the giants
We won't be silent
Who will arise

This is not the end
It's a place where we begin
In every war we fight, we fall, we bleed, we rise again
But this is not the end
When the walls are closing in (Closing in)
We won't run away
We'll shape the world and start again
We won't run away
We'll shape the world and start again
