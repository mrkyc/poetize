Renegade

There've been days I lost my way and backed down
Time I wasted, placed you in the background
I can't take it, parade and fake this
Separated tainted, it's got me on the run now
I don't want to be on the run now
Create a love in me I'll put it all down
Shake the pain, replace it let me run now
Faith is waiting I'm facing what's in front now

It's not like I'm not trying to work it out
If things are, so much harder when you're not around

I'm not always who you think I am
Sometimes I feel like I'm the renegade
And I can't just sit back and watch it fade
This time I hope you see, I'm not the enemy

I'm gone a make it, shake it on the jump now
I'm gone a break it, fade it put the gun down
Amazing grace, mistakes erased come round
I'm gonna do what it takes, remain and run in the race
Saved a wretch like me you never let down
I can see the dream I'll never let drowned
I'm not a saint but hey I'm up above ground
I'm now awake I'll chase I'll never run out
You might also like
It's not like I'm not trying to work it out
If things are, so much harder when you're not around

I'm not always who you think I am
Sometimes I feel like I'm the renegade
And I can't just sit back and watch it fade
This time I hope you see, I'm not the enemy

I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say
I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say, I'm not a renegade
I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say, I'm not a renegade
I'm not a renegade

It's not like I'm not trying to work it out
If things are, so much harder when you're not around

I'm not always who you think I am
Sometimes I feel like I'm the renegade
And I can't just sit back and watch it fade
This time I hope you see I'm not the enemy
I'm not a renegade, I'm not a renegade, no matter what you say, I'm not a renegade
