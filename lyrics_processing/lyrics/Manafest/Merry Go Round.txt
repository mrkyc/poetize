It's three in the morning, I can't ignore it
Driving to your place, feelings and heartbreaks
(Can't believe I feel like this)
Crying at red lights, holding my fists tight
Like it's a past life
(Lost my girl)
I lost an angel, probably my way out
Let me escape hell
(Will you forgive me?)
Said I was sorry, see that you got me
I'm in a bad dream

Round and round and round we go
Can't get off this merry go
Round and round and round we go
All I need's a miracle

Tell me
I'm an angel, I'm a demon, you hate me
Then you love me till you're leaving me crazy
Round and round we go
Can't get off this merry go
Kick me
Down and you're trying to kiss me
I can't figure it out
Round and round we go
Can't get off this merry go
You might also like
I'm at a dead end, holding my breath in
Making my head spin, sink and I can't swim
(Don't let me go)
I'm at your mercy, no, I'm not worthy
Can you forgive me?
(Say that you will)
Putting my hand out, cover my big mouth
I'm lost for words

Round and round and round we go
Can't get off this merry go
Round and round and round we go
All I need's a miracle

Tell me
I'm an angel, I'm a demon, you hate me
Then you love me till you're leaving me crazy
Round and round we go
Can't get off this merry go
Kick me
Down and you're trying to kiss me
I can't figure it out
Round and round we go
Can't get off this merry go
My love gone cold enough
No, no
We've lost control
Goodbye, go

Tell me
I'm an angel, I'm a demon, you hate me
Then you love me till you're leaving me crazy
Round and round we go
Can't get off this merry go
Kick me
Down and you're trying to kiss me
I can't figure it out
Round and round we go
