(Nemesis)

Fallin'
Snake bite like I'm Adam in the garden
I'm a light, so they're makin' me a target, I'm an artist
'Til I fall asleep, 'til I fall asleep
Forces
Brainwash comin' at ya in the mornin'
Chaos singin' like a chorus, I'm crawlin'
In too deep, I'm on my feet

Six minutes to midnight, caught in a fistfight
Ready to ignite
Like a thorn on the inside, standin' at ringside
Soul isn't in flight

Nemesis, arrogance
Don't you know I never quit?
Thought you had me, never did
I'll defeat my nemesis
Nemesis, hypocrite
Don't you know you're full of it?
Thought you had me, never did
I'll defeat my nemesis (Nemesis)

Soarin' (Yeah)
Take flight like an eagle when the storm hits
Rise like a phoenix into orbit, it's a warnin' (Uh)
Be the end of me, won't bow my knees (Come on)
Warrin'
Die for my freedom, never forfeit
Lies keep strayin' like a bullet, I'ma pull it (Yeah)
It's my legacy 'til we're livin' free (Woo)

Six minutes to midnight, caught in a fistfight
Ready to ignite
Like a thorn on the inside, standing at ringside
Soul isn't in flight

Nemesis, arrogance
Don't you know I never quit?
Thought you had me, never did
I'll defeat my nemesis
Nemesis, hypocrite
Don't you know you're full of it?
Thought you had me, never did
I'll defeat my nemesis (Nemesis)
Never break me, overtake me
My eyes are wide awake
Never break me, never changin'
Oh, I am not afraid
Never break me
Never changin'
My eyes are wide awake
I'm not afraid

Nemesis, arrogance
Don't you know I never quit?
Thought you had me, never did
I'll defeat you

Nemesis, arrogance
Don't you know I never quit?
Thought you had me, never did
I'll defeat my nemesis
