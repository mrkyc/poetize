Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
Oh, Manafest, T-Rock, it's not impossible, oh

This is the last time, I'll cry lullabies
All night can't sleep I hear the floors creek
I feel shadows in my room
My friends find another bruise
I'ma end up on the news
I just don't know what to do
God I'm calling you
Send an angel, send two
I want a move but I'm trapped in the outer room
I know you hear me, clearly I'm weary
Come and fill me with your power, heal me

It seems impossible for me to let this go
Feel like an animal, I'm ready to lose control
Take everything you need, take every part of me
Give me some room to breathe, before I lose control
You might also like
I gotta get away, gotta break away
(Save Me)
I gotta find away, gotta break the chains
(Take me)
Before I lose control, before I lose control
It seems impossible
It's not impossible

I'm tired, so tired of walking through this fire
If you want to find me I'll be here in my room
I'm thinking you're drinking
Need to get out before you start swinging
Wish I could show you all the pain inside me

It seems impossible (it's not impossible)
For me to let this go (let it go)
Feel like an animal (oh)
I'm ready to lose control (c'mon, yeah)
Take everything you need (go ahead)
Take every part of me (take it all)
Give me some room to breathe (oh)
Before I lose control
I gotta get away, gotta break away
(Save Me)
I gotta find away, gotta break the chains
(Take me)
Before I lose control, before I lose control
It seems impossible
It's not impossible

It seems impossible
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
For me to lose control
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
It seems impossible

It seems impossible for me to let this go
Feel like an animal
It seems impossible (it's not impossible)
For me to let this go (let it go)
Feel like an animal (oh)
I'm ready to lose control (c'mon, yeah)
Take everything you need (go ahead)
Take every part of me (take it all)
Give me some room to breathe (oh)
Before I lose control
It seems impossible (c'mon)
For me to let this go (let it go)
Feel like an animal (yeah)
It seems impossible
It's not impossible
It seems impossible, take every part of me
For me to lose control
It seems impossible
