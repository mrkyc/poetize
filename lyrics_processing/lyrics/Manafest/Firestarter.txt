I wanna be a firestarter
You can help me if you wanna
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

I've never been the one to blaze a path
But I've never been the type
That just gets walked all over
I don't normally overreact
But I just can't sit here waiting
For someone to initiate it

I won't sit back and watch it waste away

I wanna be a firestarter
You can help me if you wanna
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
I wanna be a firestarter
Put it higher, put it hotter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
You might also like
Do the right thing and don't look back
They can judge me, but they won't ever suffocate me
I can see through the truth and all the lies
You can tell me it's not worth fighting
But I've seen it, I believe it

I won't stand by and watch it waste away

I wanna be a firestarter
You can help me if you wanna
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
I wanna be a firestarter
Put it higher, put it hotter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

I'll be the one left standing (hey)
I won't be caught here stranded (no)
It don't matter what they say
It all just falls to the floor
We've got it
I'll be the one left standing (hey)
I won't be caught here stranded (no)
It don't matter what they say
It all just falls to the floor
I wanna be a firestarter, starter, starter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

I wanna be a firestarter
You can help me if you wanna
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
I wanna be a firestarter
Put it higher, put it hotter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up

I wanna be a firestarter, starter, starter
We can spread and make the whole world light up
Light up, light up
