If this is what lonely looks like

Yeah, I supposed to be sittin' at the house
Thinking about how it didn't work out
Wondering what I coulda done different (Man nothin')
Yeah, some buddies of mine were saying that I been down too long
It's about time to walk it off and get on with it
(Come on man, get on with it)

And I'm sitting here, on my second beer
Through the Marlboro Light smoke, you appear
And it hit me that I just might be alright

If this is what lonely looks like
Then bring on them sad songs
Turn up that done me wrong
Sometimes they save you when they say goodbye
Everybody ain't meant to be
But the way you're looking at me
It makes me think I'm gonna be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
If this is what lonely looks like
Yeah, if this is what lonely looks like
See Rodney Atkins LiveGet tickets as low as $17You might also like
So there it is and here we are
The ace of spades and the queen of hearts
Sharin' a drink and a shoulder
Wondering where you want to go when it's over
The funny thing about a memory is you can let it hold you down
Or have another round and make a few more
That smile of yours, look in your eyes
Thinkin' I might be alright (Be alright)

If this is what lonely looks like
Then bring on them sad songs
Turn up that done me wrong
Sometimes they save you when they say goodbye
Everybody ain't meant to be
But the way you're looking at me
It makes me think I'm gonna be fine, fine, fine, just fine
If this is what lonely looks like
(This is what lonely looks like)
Yeah, if this is what lonely looks like

Your lips got me forgetting all the might-have-beens
Nobody likes it when a movie ends
But then again, when you came walkin' in
I said if this is what lonely looks like
Then bring on them sad songs
Turn up that done me wrong
Sometimes they save you when they say goodbye (Say goodbye)
Everybody ain't meant to be
But the way you're looking at me
It makes me think I'm gonna be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
If this is what lonely looks like
(What lonely looks like)
Yeah, if this is what lonely looks like
