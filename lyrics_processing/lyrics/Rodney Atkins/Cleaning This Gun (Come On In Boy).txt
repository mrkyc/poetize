The Declaration of Independence
Think I could tell you that first sentence but then I'm lost
I can't begin to count the theories
I've had pounded in my head that I forgot
I don't remember all that Spanish
Or The Gettysburg Address
But there is one speech from high school
I'll never forget

Come on in boy, sit on down
And tell me about yourself
So you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else
She's her daddy's girl
Her momma's world
She deserves respect
That's what she'll get, ain't it son?
Now, y'all run along and have some fun
I'll see you when you get back
Bet I'll be up all night
Still cleaning this gun

Well, now that I'm a father
I'm scared to death one day my daughter
Is gonna find that teenage boy I used to be
That seems to have just one thing on his mind
She's growin' up so fast
It won't be long before
Yeah, I'll have to put the fear of God
Into some kid at the door
