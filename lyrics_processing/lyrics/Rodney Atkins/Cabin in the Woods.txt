I know the guy that owns the key to the lock on the chain of that gate
Across that gravel road that winds back into the trees
You'd never know just over that hill there's a little log house by a spring
Fed creek where the blue bells grow so thick you wouldn't believe
And he said it would be ok if we wanted to use it for a weekend getaway

Oh I want to lay down with you
In a cabin in the woods
On an old feather bed
With the fire going good
Just the two of us alone
Feeling like we should
I want to lay down with you
In a cabin in the woods

We can sit on the porch and soak up the moon light or if it gets cold we
Can go inside and light a candle or two and open up some wine
And if we get lucky it'll start to rain on that old tin roof don't you love
That sound that will get you all relaxed and freeze your mind
Come on baby lets go right now
I can't wait to get you where there's no one else around

Oh I want to lay down with you
In a cabin in the woods
On an old feather bed
With the fire going good
Just the two of us alone
Feeling like we should
I want to lay down with you
In a cabin in the woods

I want to hold you and listen to the crickets sing
And a coyote howling at the midnight train
While were doing our thing

Oh I want to lay down with you
In a cabin in the woods
On an old feather bed
With the fire going good
Just the two of us alone
Feeling like we should
I want to lay down with you
In a cabin in the woods

Baby I know the guy that owns the key to the lock on the chain of that gate
