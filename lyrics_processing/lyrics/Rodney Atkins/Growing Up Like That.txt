I was 12 years old with some bolts and a wrench, a piece of plywood that was 3/4 inch
And daddy said son once your chores are done I'll give you one of them girls old barn poles
I went out in the pasture with no cow patties, got some post hole diggers and I got after it
Had some sun on my back and a blister on my hand, but man I had myself a goal
I dribbled that ball till the grass was gone but the ground was brown and flat
And me and Daddy played horse and the cows all "mooed" and we laughed
I was lucky and I didn't even know it growing up like that

I learned the birds and the bee's from the cats and the dogs
And a frog starts out as a gollywog
The best blackberry cobbler is made from scratch
And worth every one you get from the briar patch
I found out firewood will warm you twice
Once when you cut it and once when you light it
And I can't help but smile when I look back
Cause I was lucky and I didn't even know it growing up like that

There was an old wooden barrel 'hind my grandpa's house where we threw our tater peels and coffee grounds
Say you want to catch catfish as long as your arm, son you gotta have a night crawler farm
Well we'd sit on the dock and share a bottle of pop and catch a few and then head on back
Me and Daddy clean fish while the cats "meowed" and we laughed
I was lucky and I didn't even know it growing up like that
