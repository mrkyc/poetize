He ain't much for talkin' but he means every word he says
And that color on his arms and neck ain't from no tannin' bed
Leaves no doubt 'bout where he stand on a Chevy, or the Lord
Yeah, you can always tell a country boy, yeah

Now his idea of heaven is home sweet home East Tennessee
But for a girl like you he would pull up roots and move down the road of peace
He'll always take his own sweet time if you give him a choice
Yeah, you can always tell a country boy

Yeah, you can always tell him but you can't tell him much
'Cause all he's ever gonna be is who he always was
A cross between his old man and his mommas pride and joy
You can always tell a country boy

He'll go off and take a long walk when he needs some time to think
Might even let ya drive his truck when he's had to much to drink
'Bout as true blue as ol' glory wavin' out there on the porch
Yeah, you can always tell a country boy

Yeah, you can always tell him but you can't tell him much
Sometimes his gears will turn so slow you swear they're gonna rust
From the way he bangs that ol' guitar to the gravel in his voice
You can always tells a country boy
See Rodney Atkins LiveGet tickets as low as $17You might also like
Now you can drag him from the country every now and then
But you can't drag them forty acres outta him

Yeah, you can always tell him but you can't tell him much
He's on the fence about a lot of things but on you his minds made up
'Cause he swears theres nothing sweeter than the sweet sound of your voice
You can always tell a country boy
