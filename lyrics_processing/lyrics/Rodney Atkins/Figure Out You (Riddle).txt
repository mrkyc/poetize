There's a smoke ring halo over your head
Well, you stop on green and go on red
You say the dirtiest things in the prettiest drawl
You ain't scared to jump but you're afraid to fall

You keep me beautifully confused
First kiss I stole I knew
I wanna spend the rest of my life trying to figure out you

Well, I can't make you love me if you don't
And leave this long-haired country boy alone
In the mirror while you're putting on your make up
I'm thinking fast ball, you throw me a change up
You're my favorite wonder of this world
I got a million crazy questions, girl
But only one I know the answer to
I wanna spend the rest of my life trying to figure out you

You me push me away and say, "Where you been?"
You never wanna see me 'til you see me again
You're my cloud nine high and my all time low
It's a pricey deal but I'm still sold

You keep me beautifully confused
First kiss I stole I knew
I wanna spend the rest of my life trying to figure out you

Well, I can't make you love me if you don't
And leave this long-haired country boy alone
In the mirror while you're putting on your make up
I'm thinking fast ball, you throw me a change up
You're my favorite wonder of this world
I got a million crazy questions, girl
But only one I know the answer to
I wanna spend the rest of my life trying to figure out you
Well, I can't make you love me if you don't
And leave this long-haired country boy alone
In the mirror while you're putting on your make up
I'm thinking fast ball, you throw me a change up
You're my favorite wonder of this world
I got a million crazy questions, girl
But only one I know the answer to
I wanna spend the rest of my life trying to figure out you
