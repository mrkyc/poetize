I sat beside a man from Hollywood, California, on a plane
He said he had rich and famous friends, yeah, he liked droppin' names
I said, "Well, howdy do? That's good for you, I dig a lot of those actors
But, son, you ain't got a thing on me, see, I got friends with tractors"

They'll grow your groceries, haul a load
Pull you out and fix the road
They're good at slowin' speeders down
When they pass through from out of town
I'll live out in the country happily ever after
I got everything I need 'cause I got friends with tractors

On Friday night, we hit the woods, go boggin' in our trucks
It's just about a guarantee some good ol' boy get stuck
Where I come from, you can bet your butt a mud hole ain't a factor
I'll sink mine to the floorboard 'cause I got friends with tractors

And they'll grow your groceries, haul a load
Pull you out and fix the road
They're good at slowin' speeders down
When they pass through from out of town
I'll live out in the country happily ever after
I got everything I need 'cause I got friends with tractors
Yeehaw

I've been to fancy five-star restaurants and I left there barely fed
They charged me for the water, the butter, and the bread
That gourmet meal looked more to me like fish bait on a cracker
But I'll stay fat and happy 'cause I got friends with tractors

And they'll grow your groceries, haul a load
Pull you out and fix the road
They're good at slowin' speeders down
When they pass through from out of town
We'll live out in the country happily ever after
I got everything I need 'cause I got friends with tractors
Yeah, I got everything I need 'cause I got friends with tractors
Yeehaw

Yeah, man, talkin' 'bout Internationals, John Deeres
Massey Fergusons, whatever you got, we don't discriminate
Front-end loaders, bush hogs, post hole diggers
Need 'em, gotta have 'em
I believe I do know one actor
Is Larry the Cable Guy an actor?
Oh well
He's got a tractor, hehe
