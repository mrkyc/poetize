We were thin as rails, thick as thieves
Little acorns trying to be trees
16 going on 18 going on 21
We choked on smokes, gagged on bourbon
Hitting 'em both, bound and determined
To be anywhere but where we were
Somebody mighta said it but we wouldn't have heard it

Say young man, you're growin' up so fast
You only get one chance, one chance to be a young man
Young man
You won't know what your carefree days are worth
When you're up to your blue collar neck in work
Soak it in while you can
Just be young, just be young man

She was driving me wild in a Z28
Strawberry Boones was gas on a flame
She had her finger on the trigger
Neither one of us considered the safety
Backseat rodeo was all fun and games
'Til she told me I ruined her life, she was late
I wanted to run 'cause all I could think

I'm a young man growin' up so fast
And I only get one chance, one chance to be young man
Young man
You're gonna know what your carefree days are worth
When you're up to your blue collar neck in work
Soak it in while you can
Just be young, just be, just be young man
Oh, just be young

Son, I'm cool when you do what you do
The flat brim hat and peach fuzz chin
When I go to hug you and you try to shake my hand, think again

Take it from your old man
You're growing up so fast
And you only get one chance, one chance to be young man
Young man
You don't know what your carefree days are worth
'Til you're up to your blue collar neck in work
So soak it in while you can
Just be young, just be young, man
Just be young
Oh, just be young
