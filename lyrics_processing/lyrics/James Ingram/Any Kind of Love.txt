Oh, hey

How can you say you love your father
When you have hate for your brother?
How can you say "God bless the children"
When we have homeless mothers?

Something's very wrong; something's going on
And it's gone too far, we've got to change it
Through our children's eyes
We can see the lies
Can't destroy their dreams if they're to make it

Don't you know any kind of love
Anything you've got to give will do
We just need any kind of love
So look inside your heart and make a move

Too many people pointing their fingers
But nobody's taking the blame, oh no
Sickness and poverty circle and linger
Closing in on their prey
You might also like
Something's very wrong; something's going on
And it's gone too far, we've got to change it
Running from our fears
We just waste our years
Passing by the things that really matters

Don't you know any kind of love
Anything you've got to give will do
We just need any kind of love
So look inside your heart and make a move
Make a move

If we're to change the world, turn around our future
We must come together, got to unite
'Cause in the scheme of things
All that really matters
Can you close your eyes in peace
When you sleep at night


Something's very wrong; something's going on
And it's gone too far, we've got to change it
Through our children's eyes
We can see the lies
Can't destroy their dreams if they're to make it
Don't you know any kind of love
Anything you've got to give will do
We just need any kind of love
So look inside your heart and make a move
Don't you know any kind of love
Anything you've got to give will do
If you just look inside your heart
Find a place to start and make a move

Don't you know any kind of love
Any kind will do, oh
Any kind, yeah, any kind
