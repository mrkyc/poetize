I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me runnin' through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breakin' down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
You might also like
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me runnin' through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly, if I just spread my wings

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
See me runnin' through that open door
I believe that I can fly, I can fly
I believe I can fly, I can fly
I believe I can fly, I can fly
If I just spread my wings, I can fly
I can fly, I can fly
Can I hear the choir say
I can fly
I believe that I can fly and touch the sky
I know I can fly
I believe that I can fly and touch the sky
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
Oh I know I can, I can fly
I can, I can fly, I can fly
