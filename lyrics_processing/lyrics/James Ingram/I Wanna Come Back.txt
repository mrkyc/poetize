Girl I know I was a fool
For messing around and cheating on you
I've come to see that in these hard times
True love is so hard to find

My friends said but I was too blind to see
There wasn't a better love than you and me baby
Now I'm asking you and I ain't too I proud to beg
So let me in baby, girl I was out of my head

And I wanna come back
To what I've been missin'
Give me all of your love
Your huggin' and your kissin'
I wanna come back
To what I've been missin'
Baby give me all your love
Your huggin' and your kissin'

I know you're lonely and you tried to be strong
But I really need to be close to you, girl it's been too long
I was selfish tryin' to satisfy myself
Denying all true love, lookin' or someone else
You might also like
My friends said but I was too blind to see
There was no better love than you and me
Now I'm asking you and I ain't too proud to beg
Sayin' let me in baby, girl I was out of my head

And I wanna come back
To what I've been missin'
Give me all of your love
Your huggin' and your kissin'
I wanna come back
To what I've been missin'
Baby been gone too long and I wanna come home
Now I see what you mean to me

Your, your huggin'
Your, your huggin' and your kissin'
Your, your love
I wanna come, I wanna come

I wanna come back
To what I've been missin'
Give me all of your love (Your love)
Your huggin' and your kissin'
I wanna come back
To what I've been missin'
Your lovin' and your kissin'...
Right back in my arms again
Here is where I want to be till the end
Hey baby
Woah hoo
I wanna come back
To what I've been missing
Your love
You know I miss you everyday
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
Back baby
Where I belong
In your arms
I wanna come back
