Mmmm
Oh

I remember when
Daddy used to tell us bedtime stories
As we went to sleep
Choosing words that last forever, ooh
And when I'm feeling lost
Thinking that I cannot find my way
Those words still come to me
While I'm kneeling down to pray
I can hear daddy say, '"Keep the faith and hold on
And don't let go of the promises in what He said
Troubles don't last always"

Don't let go to the mystery of His word
'Cause joy's gonna come in the morning
Don't let go, don't let go, ooh

I remember times
I try to do it all my way
It always seemed to end
With me falling on my face, ooh
The long and winding road
Sometimes turn into a pile of sand
Those words still come to me while I'm kneeling down
Kneeling down to pray
I can feel my daddy say, "Keep the faith and hold on
Don't let go of the promises in what He said
Troubles don't last always", ooh

Don't let go to the mystery of His word
'Cause joy's gonna come in the morning

Daddy said, "All the angels are singing in heaven
And I know they can be heard everywhere
Through the trials and tribulations we go through
We can hear them singing everywhere", yeah, everywhere
Singing

Don't let go of the promises in what He said
Troubles don't last always
Always
Don't let go to the mystery of his word
'Cause joy's gonna come in the morning
Don't let go

(Don't let go)
Daddy said, "Always keep the faith"
(Don't let go)
Faith is the substance of things hoped for
(Don't let go)
Evidence of things not seen
(Don't let go)
Hold on to your dreams
(Don't let go)
He said, 'No one can tear you down'
(Don't let go )
Once ya have the knowledge, boy
(Don't let go)
Don't let nobody steal ya joy, ooh
(Don't let go)
Don't cha lean to ya own understanding
(Don't let go)
Letcha Father directcha path
(Don't let go)
Speak it, see it, dream it
(Don't let go)
Then you can believe it
(Don't let go)
And you can live
(Don't let go)
My daddy told me
(Don't let go)
Know that your body's the temple
Spirit the most high, God lives within you, boy
I said," Thank you, father, ooh
Daddy, I won't let go
You put your love so deep inside of me
And all of my brothers and sisters
I'm so glad you were a grand man
