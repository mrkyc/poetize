I did my best, but I guess my best wasn't good enough
'Cause here we are back where we were before
Seems nothin' ever changes, we're back to being strangers
Wondering if we ought to stay or head on out the door

Just once
Can we figure out what we keep doin' wrong?
Why we never last for very long
What are we doin' wrong?
Just once
Can we find a way to finally make it right?
To make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it
I know we could break through it
(Hmm hmmmm)

I gave my all, but I think my all may have been too much
'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere
Seems we're always blowin' whatever we've got goin'
And it seems at times with all we've got, we haven't got a prayer

Just once
Can we figure out what we keep doin' wrong?
Why the good times never last for long
Where are we goin' wrong?
Just once
Can we find a way to finally make it right?
To make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it
If we could just get to it
You might also like
Just once
I want to understand
Why it always comes back to goodbye
Why can't we get ourselves in hand?
And admit to one another
We're no good without each other
Take the best and make it better
Find a way to stay together

Just once
Can we find a way to finally make it right?
Whoa, to make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it
If we could just get to it
Just once

Whoa oh, we can get to it
