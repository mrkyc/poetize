Oh yeah

She's the kind of lady as gentle as a breeze
But she's as strong as anyone
And she's always wants to please
She's a lady, the kind that's hard to find
And all the guys from miles around
Are wondering, "Boy, what's on your mind?"
Don't you realize if you really want her
You better treat her right, oh
Don't take love for granted
'Cause she's the kind of lady who really needs a man
One who has a gentle touch, someone who understands
She's a lady and all she really needs
Is just a little tenderness
And, boy, you're just too blind to see
Don't you realize if you really want her

If you want her, you better treat her right
Love her with all your might
Take care of all her needs
Fall in love again
You better hold on tight
You've got to make things right
You've got to let her see you're in love again
You might also like
'Cause all she ever wanted
Was to never be lonely anymore
So if you really need her
You better treat her right, oh
Don't take love for granted
You've got to let her know
If you really love her

If you love her, you better treat her right
Love her with all your might
Fall in love again
You better hold on
Gotta make things right
Let her see you're in love again
You better treat her right
Love her
Let her see you're in love with her again, oh

So if you really want her
You better treat her right, oh
Don't take love for granted
To save the love, you've got to treat her right
Every day and night, you've got to give it all
To save the love, you've got to treat her right
All she wants is tender lips, if you want her, oh
To save the love, you've got to treat her right
Save love, woo-hoo, ooh, day and night, night and day
To save the love, you've got to treat her right
To save the love, you've got to treat her right
Oh, oh, oh yeah (Don't take love for granted)
