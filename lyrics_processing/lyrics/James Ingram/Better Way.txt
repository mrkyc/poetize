Won't change my mind, I'm on my way
Wanna see this paradise
I have a dream and it's so clear
Won't think about it twice, no, no

Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to turn my head, no
Don't try to tell me who I am
'Cause freedom lives in me, so wild and free

(Yeah, yeah)
There's gotta be a better way
To put the love inside my life, baby
There's gotta be a better way
Without your loving here, where will I find love?

I'm coming down on promises
Wanna put 'em far away, yeah, yeah
'Cause what I feel is oh so real
It's gonna be a better day, yeah

So don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to turn my head, no
Don't try to tell me who I am
'Cause freedom lives in me, so wild and free
You might also like
(Yeah, yeah)
There's gotta be a better way
To put the love inside my life, baby
There's gotta be a better way
Without your loving here, where will I find love?

I can feel it as the time goes by
(Time, time, time, time)
Your spirit getting closer and closer
I must be on a natural high
'Cause I'm feeling no pain
No, no, woo hoo

There's gotta be a better way
To put the love inside my life, baby
There's gotta be a better way
Without your loving here, where will I find love?

Comes the answer, what's the question?
All I want to know
(If you wanna be free)
Talk to me but if you wanna run, I'll let you go
There's gotta be a better way
To put the love inside my life, baby
There's gotta be a better way
Without your loving here, where will I find love?
There's gotta be a better way
To put the love inside my life, baby
There's gotta be a better way
Without your loving here, where will I find love?
There's got to be a better, better
