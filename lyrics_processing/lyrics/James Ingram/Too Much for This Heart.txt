Ordinarily I would fall in love
But that's not likely anymore
'Cause I was hurt too bad before
And any other time I would let you in
But it's just too soon to chance it
So please try and understand

You're too much for this heart of mine
It's been broken too many times
I guess I'm not ready yet to let my feelings go
Maybe somewhere on down the line
I'll give love one more try
But for now you're just too much for this heart of mine

Don't get me wrong I really want you here
But if my heart is what you need
Then you might do well to leave
I'm not saying I'll never fall in love again
But it's just too soon to chance it
So please try and understand

You're too much for this heart of mine
It's been broken too many times
I guess I'm not ready yet to let my feelings go
Maybe somewhere on down the line
I'll give love one more try
But for now you're just too much for this heart of mine
You might also like
It has nothing to do with you
And I hope you can understand
Give me time to believe in love again

You're too much for this heart of mine
It's been broken too many times
I'm not ready yet to let my feelings go
Maybe somewhere on down the line
I'll give love one more try
But for now you're just too much for this heart of

Lost in mending

This heart of mine
Been broken many times
Heart of mine
Too many times
I'm not ready yet to let my feelings go
Maybe somewhere on down the line
I'll give love one more try
But for now you're just too much for this heart of
Lost in mending
I'm trying to understand
This heart of mine
It's been broken so many times
Lost in mending
I'm trying to understand
This heart of mine
