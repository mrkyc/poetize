The thing that makes birds forget to sing
Yes, you've got that thing, that certain thing
You've got that charm, that subtle charm
That makes young farmers desert the farm
You've got that thing, that certain thing
You've got what Adam craved when he
With love for Eve was tortured
She only had an apple tree
But you, you've got an orchard
You've got those ways, those ticking ways
That make me rush off to Cartier's
For a wedding ring, yes, you've got that thing
You've got that thing, you've got that thing
The thing that makes vines prefer to cling
Yes, you've got that thing, that certain thing
You've got those looks, those fatal looks
That make book censors enjoy their books
'Cause you've got that thing, that certain thing
Just what made Samson be for years
Delilah's Lord and keeper
She only had a pair of shears
But you, you've got a reaper
You might also likeYou've got that power, the power to grip
That makes me map out a wedding trip
For the early spring 'cause you've got that thing
You've got that thing, you've got that thing
The thing that makes bees refuse to sting
You've got that thing, that certain thing
You've got that kiss, the kiss that warms
That makes reformers reform reforms
You've got that thing, yes, that certain thing
They tell us Trojan Helen's lips
Made every man her slavey
If her face launched a thousand ships
But yours could launch a navy
You've got that that love and such a lot
It makes me think you're prepared for what
Any stork might bring
'Cause you've got that thing, zada, zing, zing, zing
Yes, you've got, them hot, you've got
You know you've got
You've got that thing
Yes, you've got that thing
Yes, you've got that thing
Yes, you've got that thing
