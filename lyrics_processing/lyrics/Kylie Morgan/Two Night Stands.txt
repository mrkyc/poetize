Caught you lookin' at me
I pretended not to notice
Talkin' that Tennessee
Wearin' that jacket like you stole it
Started hangin' out, talkin' smack
Then a kiss, and then a few
Lookin' back, I didn't know that
One-night stand would turn into

Two nightstands, both sides of the bed
Two lamps goin' out when I lay my head
On your chest 'til the sun through the blinds starts pourin'
Like the two cups of coffee in the mornin'
Was just havin' fun, wasn't lookin' for the one
No, forever wasn't part of my plan
But that one-night stand put a ring on my hand
And I wound up with two nightstands, yeah

Can't believe that night was our last first kiss
I smiled and said, "I never do things like this"
Now we got the same mailbox and the same last name
Turns out goin' home with you, best bad decision I ever made
You might also like
Two nightstands, both sides of the bed
Two lamps goin' out when I lay my head
On your chest 'til the sun through the blinds starts pourin'
Like the two cups of coffee in the mornin'
Was just havin' fun, wasn't lookin' for the one
No, forever wasn't part of my plan
But that one-night stand put a ring on my hand
And I wound up with two nightstands, yeah

Ooh, what one night can turn into
Ooh, love doin' life with you

Two nightstands, both sides of the bed
Two lamps goin' out when I lay my head
On your chest 'til the sun through the blinds starts pourin'
Like the two cups of coffee in the mornin'
Was just havin' fun, wasn't lookin' for the one
No, forever wasn't part of my plan
But that one-night stand put a ring on my hand
And I wound up with two nightstands, yeah
