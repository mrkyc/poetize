So you miss me, wanna know how I been
And get a drink with me, but exes can't be friends
Next thing I know I'm in the front seat of your car
Next thing I know we're making out in the back of the bar

Shoulda locked down, shoulda laid low
Shoulda poured two for one alone
I know it now but it's too late
Shoulda hung up when I saw your name
Oh, I knew better than to ever think that you could change
Shoulda, woulda, coulda
I ain't never been no good at staying home when I know that I shoulda
Shoulda, woulda, coulda
I ain't never been no good at staying home when I know that I shoulda, shoulda
(Shoulda, shoulda)

When they said last call, that shoulda been my cue
But that alcohol, damn, the things it makes me do
Next thing I know I'm sleeping in your bed again
Next thing I know I'm sneaking out in your jacket
Like a bad habit, high heels in my hand

Shoulda locked down, shoulda laid low
Shoulda poured two for one alone
I know it now but it's too late
Shoulda hung up when I saw your name
Oh, I knew better than to ever think that you could change
Shoulda, woulda, coulda
I ain't never been no good at staying home when I know that I shoulda
Shoulda, woulda, coulda
I ain't never been no good at staying home when I know that I shoulda, shoulda
(Shoulda, shoulda)
You might also like
Next thing I know I'm doin' things I know I shouldn't do
But here I go again

Shoulda locked down, shoulda laid low
Shoulda poured two for one alone
I know it now but it's too late
Shoulda hung up when I saw your name
Oh, I knew better than to ever think that you could change
Shoulda, woulda, coulda
I ain't never been no good at staying home when I know that I shoulda
Shoulda, woulda, coulda
I ain't never been no good at staying home when I know that I shoulda, shoulda
(Shoulda, shoulda)

Shoulda known, shoulda known, shoulda known
