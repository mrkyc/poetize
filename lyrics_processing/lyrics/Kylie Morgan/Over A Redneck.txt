Got some pretty pink neon
A little "Purple Rain" playing
A pair of baby-blue eyes across this dive
Wondering if I'm taken
I should be good as gold
I shouldn't feel this blue
Sipping on a round or two of silver lining in your goodbye
Wish it was green lights to getting through

But all I can think about is a red truck
Kicking up red dirt
Red-light kiss and tugging on a red t-shirt
Hands down hotter than a Marlboro Red burns
Burning up a red sunset
All I can think about is a read text, never heard back though
Sound of your Red Wings flying out the front door
If I had caught a red flag, I wouldn't be having to get
Over a redneck

Red, red, red, redneck
Red, red, red, redneck

It's pretty black-and-white baby
It's been a gray sky summer
Nothing but a buncha thunder and rain
Steady flooding my brain with the same damn color
You might also like
All I can think about is a red truck
Kicking up red dirt
Red-light kiss and tugging on a red t-shirt
Hands down hotter than a Marlboro Red burns
Burning up a red sunset
All I can think about is a read text, never heard back though
Sound of your Red Wings flying out the front door
If I had caught a red flag, I wouldn't be having to get
Over a redneck

For the first time in my life
I wish I was color-blind

'Cause all I can think about is that damn red truck
Kicking up red dirt
Red-light kiss and tugging on a red t-shirt
Hands down hotter than a Marlboro Red burns
Burning up a red sunset
All I can think about is a read text, never heard back though
Sound of your Red Wings flying out the front door
If I had caught a red flag, I wouldn't be having to get
Over a redneck
Red, red, red, redneck
