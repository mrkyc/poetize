She got me through high school
She'd probably post my bail
She's the one who'd get me drunk
Be next to me in jail
She's my voice of reason
She's my biggest fan
She's who told me, "Leave the boy
And find yourself a man"

If girls run the world
You're why mine keeps spinnin'
So I gotta ask you, will you be

My bridesmaids, my ride-or-die's
My champagne-tipsy kind of tribe
Wild ones right by my side
Rockin' black while I'm wearin' white
Sisters I get to choose
Mighta found the one, but I need you too
The song's always about the groom
But I just can't say "I do" without
My bridesmaids (Ooh-ooh)
My bridesmaids (Ooh-ooh)
You might also like
She'll keep the bubbles coming
She'll make sure we're on time
She'll keep my cold feet from runnin'
And hide all the red wine
They'll have tissues ready
When they see Mama cry
Yeah, I've been blessed with the best
And let me tell you why

'Cause they're my bridesmaids, my ride or die's
My champagne-tipsy kind of tribe
Wild ones right by my side
Rockin' black while I'm wearin' white
Sisters I get to choose
Mighta found the one, but I need you too
The song's always about the groom
But I just can't say "I do" without
My bridesmaids (Ooh-ooh)
My bridesmaids (Ooh-ooh)

Girls run the world
That's why life's a party
Welcome, my wedding day army
My bridesmaids, my ride or die's
My champagne-tipsy kind of tribe
Wild ones right by my side
Rockin' black while I'm wearin' white
Sisters I get to choose
Mighta found the one, but I need you too
The song's always about the groom
But I just can't say "I do" without
My bridesmaids (Girls run the world, ooh-ooh)
My bridesmaids (Girls run the world, ooh-ooh)
