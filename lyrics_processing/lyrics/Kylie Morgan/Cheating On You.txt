You don't touch me like you used to
You don't kiss me like you want to
I know somethin' is strange when you say my name
Ooh, feels like we're miles apart
Ooh, when you're holdin' me in the dark

Why does it feel like I'm cheatin' on you
Even though you're lyin' next to me?
Why does it feel like a hotel room
And there's a stranger in the bed with me?
We're so close, but I'm not yours anymore
In the same arms, but your heart's gone out the door
It's like you turned into someone new
And it don't feel right, why does it feel like I'm
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on you
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on you

Same hands holdin' on my hips
And same eyes lookin' at me different
I feel guilty 'cause I can't say goodbye, no

Why does it feel like I'm cheatin' on you
Even though you're lyin' next to me?
Why does it feel like a hotel room
And there's a stranger in the bed with me?
We're so close, but I'm not yours anymore
In the same arms, but your heart's gone out the door
It's like you turned into someone new
And it don't feel right, why does it feel like I'm
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on you
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on you
You might also like
Ooh, like I'm lyin' with somebody else
Ooh, or am I just lyin' to myself?

'Cause it feels like I'm cheatin' on you
Even though you're lyin' next to me
Why does it feel like a hotel room
And there's a stranger in the bed with me?
We're so close, but I'm not yours anymore
In the same arms, but your heart's gone out the door
It's like you turned into someone new
And it don't feel right, why does it feel like I'm
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on you
Cheatin' on, cheatin' on you

Cheatin' on, cheatin' on you
