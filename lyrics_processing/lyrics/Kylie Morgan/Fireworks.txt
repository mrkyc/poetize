I've had my skin turn so red
But I still stand in the sun
Yeah, I've been stabbed in the back by my friends
But I still make new ones
I've almost drowned, waves knocked me down
But I still love the ocean
So why would I hold back my heart
Just 'cause it's been broken

Since I first saw you that night on those stairs
In the middle of a party, just you and me there
Suddenly I forgot all of the times I've been hurt
And damn, I've been hurt
Now lookin' back I don't know what I'd do
If I blamed my past and I missed out on you
I hope that I never learn
'Cause even though I've been burned
I still love fireworks

I've felt those sparks in so many dive bars
But what they want is all the same
I've even drive a boy home for Christmas
We died like a tree before Valentine's Day
But I'll still take you home to Oklahoma anyway
You might also like
Since I first saw you that night on those stairs
In the middle of a party, just you and me there
Suddenly I forgot all of the times I've been hurt
And damn, I've been hurt
Now lookin' back I don't know what I'd do
If I blamed my past and I missed out on you
I hope that I never learn
'Cause even though I've been burned
I still love fireworks

So light me up, oh-oh, oh, oh
Light me up, oh-oh, oh, oh
Light me up, oh-oh, oh, oh
I'll never let you go

Since I first saw you that night on those stairs
In the middle of a party, just you and me there
Suddenly I forgot all of the times I've been hurt
And damn I've been hurt
Now lookin' back I don't know what I'd do
If I blamed my past and I missed out on you
I hope that I never learn
'Cause even though I've been burned
