I ain't ridin' shotgun, I can drive myself
I can wear my own T-shirt, don't need nobody else's
I don't need nobody's help and
If I had too much to drink, I'd find my own way home
I can change my own tires, least I'd figure it out as I go
Yeah, I'm good at bein' alone

So why do I have this feeling?
A tightening in my chest?
I don't kow what this means
Just that it's makin' me a mess 'cause

Somethin' about your body
Makes me sad when it's not on me
My heart don't know what to do
It makes me mad how bad I need you
'Cause my self's more than enough
That independence in my blood
It's somethin' I don't wanna lose
So it makes me mad how bad I need you

So why am I in a hurry to get home?
See your face, fall into your arms
When you open up the front door
I used to wanna go out more
You might also like
I'm not good at sharin' my feelings
You're lucky I'm sharin' 'em now
I don't know what this means
No, I've never said it out loud

Somethin' about your body
Makes me sad when it's not on me
My heart don't know what to do
It makes me mad how bad I need you
'Cause my self's more than enough
That independence in my blood
It's somethin' I don't wanna lose
It makes me mad how bad I need you

How bad I need you, baby
It makes me mad
Ooh

Somethin' about your body
Makes me sad when it's not on me
My heart don't know what to do
It makes me mad how bad I need you
'Cause my self's more than enough
That independence in my blood
It's somethin' I don't wanna lose
It makes me mad how bad I need you
How bad I need you, baby
