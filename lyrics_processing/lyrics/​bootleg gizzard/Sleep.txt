One, two, three, four

Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo

I got up early
And you got up early, too
And you pull me under
And you say "My leg"
But I'd rather go back to sleep again
But I don't wanna stay like this for five more minutes

And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up

Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo
Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo

And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, it's time to wake up
And you always sleep before the day goes, woo
You might also like
I got up early
And you got up early
And you pull me under
And you say "My leg"
Ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo, ey, yo
