You're still asleep and you're so beautiful
I'm so proud that i lie right beside you
My bed, my sheets, you and me, so suitable
You give me the best of you, and i wanna give you the best of me
I know that to two of us together we are meant to be
I adore you, my body's calling for you
I feel like i've come home when i'm with you
You're so beautiful
I just thought you ought to know
This is original
I never felt like this way before
And now i'm waking up with you
I can't belive that this is true
You're so beautiful
The glow of a candle caresses your face on my pillow
You just fell asleep and you're so beautiful (you're so beautiful)
It feels so good, i cannot belive it's real
This silence of the night, you by my side, i got it all (i got it all)
You give me the best of you, and i wanna give you the best of me
I know that the two of us together we are meant to be
I adore you, my body's calling for you
I really, really, really, really love you
