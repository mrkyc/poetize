I wanna do it
I, I, I, I)
Heyeyey
Ohoho
I saw you in the club
With your boys you were looking rough
You're making contact to me
I'm living in a dream
This isn't make believe
I want you to know
That I won't let go, my body shows
You're everything I need
Won't you stay mine from dawn 'till night (I'm in love)
And live our fantasy (I'm in love, I wanna do it)
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love) I'm in love
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I wanna do it)
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I wanna do it)

Can we drive into the night
So it's just you and me?
I step into your light
I see that it shines bright
We're meant to be
I won't let go, my body shows
You're everything I need
Won't you stay mine from dawn 'till night (I'm in love)
And live our fantasy (I'm in love, I wanna do it)
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love) I'm in love

And our love will shine
I'll always be yours
And you'll always be mine
