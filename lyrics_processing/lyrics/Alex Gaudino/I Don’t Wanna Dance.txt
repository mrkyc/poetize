She's futuristic, she's not my body, and she's got me rockin' hard on the middle of the dancefloor. I can't escape it, I just can't take it. This beat so hard. I'm locked in the middle of the dancefloor

I don't wanna dance, unless I can dance with you, all night
I don't wanna dance, unless I can dance with you, all night
I don't wanna dance, unless I can dance with you, all night
I don't wanna dance, unless I can dance with you, all night

Girl, girl you a star, let's put this on the floor. We in the motion picture your body's rated-r. When we step in the function, you know we in control
Cause the beats so hard, that it melts and it burns light up and you can't let go. Can't let go, can't let go. Can't let go, you can't let go. Can't let go

I don't wanna dance, unless I can dance with you, all night
I don't wanna dance, unless I can dance with you, all night
I don't wanna dance, unless I can dance with you, all night
I don't wanna dance, unless I can dance with you, all night
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Let the beat go, whooohoooo

She's so amazing, she got me dancing. We in the music, aah, this is our anthem. Tonight we celebrate this moment and we won't stop now
