Shes not my body
And shes got me rockin hard on the middle of the dancefloor
I can't escape it
I just can't take it
This beat so hard
Im locked in the middle of the dancefloor
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
Girl, girl you a star
Lets put this on the floor
We in te motion picture your bodys rated-r
When we step in the function
You know we in control
Cause the beats so hard
That it melts and it burns light up and you can't let go
Can't let go, can't let go
Can't let go, you can't let go
Can't let go
Can't let go, can't let go
Can't let go, you can't let go
Can't let go
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Shes so amazing
She got me dancing
We in the music, aah
This is our anthem
Tonight we celebrate this moment and we won't stop now
Shes so amazing
She got me dancing
We in the music, aah
This is our anthem
Tonight we celebrate this moment and we won't stop now
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
I dont wanna dance
Unless I can dance with you, all night
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
Let the beat go, whooohoooo
