I, I wasn't even searching for love
That's usually right when it creeps up on you
And I know in my heart, it's true
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Boy, you got my attention, what's up?
My heart is beating
Your screaming got me open so much
I think I'm dreaming

Got my hands way up
I surrender to love

What a feeling
To let it all go
What a feeling
I'm losing control
What a feeling
Feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling
What a feeling

Mmm, I, I used to think I'd never fall in love
It's like my favorite star I used to stare at every night
Came down from the sky
Oh yeah
Ooh, when I love the way you touch (My heart is beating)
Boy, I just can't get enough (You've got me speechless)
You might also like
Got my hands way up
I surrender to love

What a feeling
To let it all go
What a feeling
I'm losing control
What a feeling
Feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling
What a feeling
To let it all go
What a feeling
I'm losing control
What a feeling
Feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling
What a feeling

(Can you feel it feel it, feel it, feel it?)
Ooh, what a feeling
(Can you feel it feel it, feel it, feel it?)
What a feeling
(Can you feel it feel it, feel it, feel it?)
What a feeling
(Can you feel it feel it, feel it, feel it?)
What a feeling
To let it all go
What a feeling
I'm losing control
What a feeling
Feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling
What a feeling (Oh)
To let it all go
What a feeling
I'm losing control
What a feeling
Feels like I'm on top of the world
What a feeling
