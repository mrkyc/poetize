Born on a mountain top in Tennessee
Greenest state in the land of the free
Raised in the woods so's he knew every tree
Killed himself a bear when he was only three

Davy, Davy Crockett
King of the wild frontier

In 1813, the Creeks uprose
Adding redskin arrows to the country's woes
Now Indian fighting is something he knows
So he shoulders his rifle and off he goes

Davy, Davy Crockett
The man who don't know fear

Off through the woods, he's a-marching along
Making up yarns and singing a song
Itchy for a fighting and a writing a wrong
He's rangy as a bear and twice as strong

Davy, Davy Crockett
The buckskin buccaneer

He fought single-handed through the Indian war
'Til the Creeks was whipped and the peace was in store
And while he was handling this risky chore
He made himself a legend forever more

Davy, Davy Crockett
King of the wild frontier

He gave his word and he gave his hand
That his Indian friends could keep their land
And the rest of his life he took to stand
That justice was due every redskin band

Davy, Davy Crockett
Holding his promise dear

He went off to Congress and served a spell
Fixing up the government and laws as well
Took over Washington so we here'd tell
And patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett
Seeing his duty clear

When he'd come home, his politicking done
The big western march had just begun
So he packed his gear and his trusty gun
And lit out a-grinning to follow the sun

Davy, Davy Crockett
Leading the pioneer

He heard of Houston and Austin and so
To the Texas plains he just had to go
Where freedom was fighting another foe
And they needed him at the Alamo

Davy, Davy Crockett
The man who don't know fear

His land is biggest and his land is best
From grassy plains through the mountain's crest
He's ahead of us all, meeting the test
Following his legend into the West
Davy, Davy Crockett
