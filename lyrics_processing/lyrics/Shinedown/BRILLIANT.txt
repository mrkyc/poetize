Count it down from ten to one
Faster than a firefly
Calling out to everyone:
"Are you dead or alive?"
Quicker than the curious
And brighter than a meteor
Never knowing who to trust
Can make me insecure

Let me clear my throat
Let me catch my breath
Let my heart bleed out
Till there's nothing left
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

Count it down from ten to one
Faster than a hurricane
Calling out to everyone:
"Are you mad or insane?"
Quicker when you're curious
And better once you realize
Finding someone you can trust
Gets results, check your pulse

Let me clear my throat
Let me catch my breath
Let my heart bleed out
Till there's nothing left
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

Say it if you're one of us
The beaten and the furious
Been chastised, analyzed
For the very last time
It's all the same (Believe it or not)
But this ain't a game (And I'll never stop)
So, you better run for your life

Let me clear my throat
Let me catch my breath
Let my heart bleed out
Till there's nothing left
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

To whom it may concern:
I won't crash and burn
Burn, burn
I won't crash and...

Let me clear my throat
Let me catch my breath
Let my heart bleed out
Till there's nothing left
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

As the world collides
And I fight for air
As I crash and burn
Like I just don't care
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant
(Do you want to live forever?)
Count it down from ten to one
Quicker when you're curious
Say it if you're one of us
The beaten and the furious
Are you mad or insane?
Mad or insane?
Are you mad or insane?
You better run for your life
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant!
