Can you hear me?
Am I speaking clearly?
Are you starstruck
Or just made of stone?
Do you need a savior?
Some bad behavior?
Or you could cash it all in
I suppose

Because you're in deep
Resist and repeat
Face forward
And don't come unhinged
Block out the actors
And all these bastards
That took all the fun
Out of rage and revenge

Don't be so quick to judge
Rain havoc from above
I think I've had enough
Time to raise the dead
It's all subliminal
Supernatural
I might be mental
But I've still got my cred

So, welcome to the party
Won't you please come inside?
Where habits have teeth
And the words carry knives
You enter at your own risk
So don't be surprised
Welcome to the dark side

Spare me your sorrow
There's no tomorrow
That's an empty promise at best
I've tried to play nice
You were baptized in ice
So, don't tell me you're just depressed

Don't be so quick to judge
Rain havoc from above
I think I've had enough
Time to raise the dead
It's all subliminal
Supernatural
I might be mental
But I've still got my cred
So, welcome to the party
Won't you please come inside?
Where habits have teeth
And the words carry knives
You enter at your own risk
So don't be surprised
Welcome to the dark side

Your equilibrium
Has been spun all around
And everything you know
Turned upside down
The symptoms are contagious
So please be advised
So, welcome to the dark side
