Hip, hip, hip hooray they say
You've got it made
Hip, hip, hip hooray, hooray
Yeah, the world is a stage
Where you can act out loud and rattle the cage
And remove any doubt that you're enraged
Like a fool, I guess, at the end of the day
You might be woke but not awake

Pray if you need it
Beg if you want it
Scream if you're for it
Devastation
Pray if you need it
Beg if you want it
Scream if you hate it
Desperation, the wrong information

Pray for your family and cry yourself to sleep
Pledge your allegiance to the flag under your feet
Is this apocalypse now? Who let the animals out?
Hip hip hooray, say something shocking
Who doesn't love a parade with gasoline and grenades?
Don't be afraid, it's just America burning
