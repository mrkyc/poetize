Can I have a moment of your time?
Just a single second so you see
That, indeed, we'll be leaving you behind
Far across that line
Turn it up so you can hear the bells
Crashing through the clouds
Acid rain down the drain
We know all too well, it's a living hell

Careful what you say and who you say it
And who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say it to

Maybe you talk too much
And you were askin' for it, asking for it, asking
And you can blame bad luck
But you were askin' for it, asking for it, asking
When all is said and done
You need to tie your tongue
'Cause when you spit on everyone
You are, you are, you know you're
Askin' for it, asking for it, asking

Caught up in the gutter once again
Thrashin' through the mud
Flowin' lies, cutting ties till the sidewalk ends
And the truth begins
Power through the point of no return
Famously deranged
All the same, hope you change
If the worm is gonna turn
It's none of my concern

Careful what you say and who you say it
And who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say it to

Maybe you talk too much
And you were askin' for it, asking for it, asking
And you can blame bad luck
But you were askin' for it, asking for it, asking
When all is said and done
You need to tie your tongue
'Cause when you spit on everyone
You are, you are, you know you're
Askin' for it, asking for it, asking
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo, oh
Ooh-hoo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo, oh

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are asking for it
You are, you are
You are, you are
You are asking for it

Maybe you talk too much
And you were askin' for it, asking for it, asking
And you can blame bad luck
But you were askin' for it, asking for it, asking
When all is said and done
You need to tie your tongue
'Cause when you spit on everyone
You are, you are, you know you're
Askin' for it, asking for it, asking

You know you're asking for it, asking for it
