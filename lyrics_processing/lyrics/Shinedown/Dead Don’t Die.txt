Flatline for the ninth time
I'm on a first name basis with the afterlife
And there's no ceiling when you're the demon
I dug myself out of the dirt for a reason

And I'm never running, so try it again
Started me over right back at the end
"When's the last time you were afraid?"
"I haven't been afraid a day in my life"

The dead don't die, the heart still beats
Head held high, I haunt these streets
Life's killed me a hundred thousand times
You can try, you can try, but the dead don't die
Knock me down six feet deep
One more round, no reprieve
Life's killed me a hundred thousand times
You can try, you can try, but the dead don't die

In the mirror, no reflection
Another day, just another resurrection
Where's the glory? Just another story
I won't be the ending that was written for me

And I'm never running, so try it again
Started me over right where it began
"It's pretty boring, isn't it? This existence
Might as well not take fear off the table"

The dead don't die, the heart still beats
Head held high, I haunt these streets
Life's killed me a hundred thousand times
You can try, you can try, but the dead don't die
Knock me down six feet deep
One more round, no reprieve
Life's killed me a hundred thousand times
You can try, you can try, but the dead don't die

"I think everyone's a little scared of what's next
Live or die, live or die"


The dead don't die, the heart still beats
Head held high, I haunt these streets
Life's killed me a hundred thousand times
You can try, you can try, but the dead don't die
Knock me down six feet deep
One more round, no reprieve
Life's killed me a hundred thousand times
You can try, you can try, but the dead don't die (Hey)

Life's killed me a hundred thousand times
