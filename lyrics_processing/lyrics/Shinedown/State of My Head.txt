It's been a long, bumpy ride
Sitting back in the saddle
It's time to get down, dirty up
Our knees in the battle

The only way I'm leaving is dead
That's the state of my, state of my
State of my head

Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
I'm coming back for more
Do you feel me now? Do you feel me now?
I'm breaking down your door
I'm not speaking under my breath
'Cause the harder you push, the rougher I get
'Cause I'm not shaking, when the earth starts quaking
Got my own foundation with no hesitation and the
