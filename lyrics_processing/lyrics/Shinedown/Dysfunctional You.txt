Suicide, suicide, one, two, three
Maybe these drugs are addicted to me
Can you hear me in there?
Is there anyone there?
Keep your dyslexia next to your imaginary friends
They all talk shit about the shape I'm in
Yeah, they really don't care
They're breathin' rarified air

So pack your bags and leave a note
And thank the ones that kept you afloat
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And gather all your hopes and dreams
They can keep you company
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And go on and be your dysfunctional self
Life's too short to play someone else
'Cause being normal is just a trap
But you're never so gone that you can't turn back
So go on and be unpredictable
Shatter the glass when it's half full
The audience has waited all this time
You're well-rehearsed and you know your lines
So introduce them to
The wonderful dysfunctional you

Terrified, look alive, maybe they're right
I'm a little too dim when the moment gets bright
I'm a total eclipse
Can you read my lips?
They're sayin', "Come on, come on, are you out of your mind?
The crazy feels good and the water's just fine"
So I take a deep breath
They ain't seen nothin' yet

So go on and be your dysfunctional self
Life's too short to play someone else
'Cause being normal is just a trap
But you're never so gone that you can't turn back
So go on and be unpredictable
Shatter the glass when it's half full
The audience has waited all this time
You're well-rehearsed and you know your lines
So introduce them to
The wonderful dysfunctional you

Who's it gonna be, who's the first in line?
Well, step right up to the firing line
Tell me (Pick me), tell me (No, me)
Little by little, it'll all make sense
When you step right up in our defense
Tell me (Pick me), tell me (No, me)
And go on and be your dysfunctional self
Life's too short to play someone else
'Cause being normal is just a trap
But you're never so gone that you can't turn back
So go on and be unpredictable
Shatter the glass when it's half full
The audience has waited all this time
You're well-rehearsed and you know your lines
So introduce them to
The wonderful dysfunctional you

Dysfunctional you
