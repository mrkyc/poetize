There's thirty seconds left
What's gonna happen next?
You better watch your step
The wicked, they don't ever rest
Yeah, they don't ever rest

Ain't nothin' cut-and-dry
No retro overdrive
I bet the fuse is live
I feel it when the doves cry
Yeah, when the doves cry

What can you do?
Where can you go?
When your momma is a burnout
And your daddy is a pyro

'Cause they just want to light it on fire
And they just want to let it all burn
And they just want to light it on fire
And they just want to let it all burn

It's never one-and-done
It's only just begun
And now the inmates
Are running the asylum
Runnin' the asylum

Am I a headcase?
Did I inherit this?
Am I a hypocrite
To say that I ain't feelin' this? (No, no, no, no, no!)
'Cause I ain't feelin' this (No, no, no, no, no, no, no!)
