I can still remember me and Miss November Rain
Beautiful and strange
Always so inclined, coloring outside the lines
Yeah, you were never on time

You've always been slightly awkward, kind of weird
Upside down and not all here
What's wrong with me and you is crystal clear

Sometimes I'm in a room where I don't belong
And the house is on fire and there's no alarm
And the walls are melting too
How 'bout you?
I've never been the favorite, thought I'd seen it all
'Til I got my invitation to the lunatic ball
And my friends are comin' too
How 'bout you?
Don't worry, it's all just a symptom of being human

Unpack all your baggage, hide it in the attic, where
You hope it disappears
This all seems so familiar, but it doesn't feel like home
It's just another unknown

Right or wrong, it's all so crystal clear

How 'bout you?
Don't worry, it's all just a symptom of being human

We're all just passin' through
Passengers on a ship of fools
