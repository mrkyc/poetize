Lookee here, got 'em all lined up
Same bitchy girls and boys
On their hands, on their knees
Slither through the streets
Programmed to seek and destroy
And it all adds up
And it all adds up

Oh, my, my, no one's on my side
Too paranoid to listen to me
You can cast me out
You can tape my mouth
But you can't get a stone to bleed
And it all adds up
And it all adds up

You know I love it
When you say you're afraid
Don't you hate it
When I'm making you shake?
Hang the truth from a noose
Put a hit man on the loose
Now you're counting on him
Making your day

There ain't no magic bullet
There's no cure for the weak
There's no sympathetic shoulder
Here to put you to sleep
You're a long, long way from
Where you thought you would be
Every murder has a motive
But you ain't killing me

And it all adds up
You got something to say?
And it all adds up
Say it!

Riddle me this
Before I take it back
Been stealing my shit for years
So, kiss my choir
The bad man's fire
'Cause you know
I'm gonna bring you to tears
And it all adds up
And it all adds up
Shake, shake, shake
Callin' all the snakes
Been itching for the new payroll
Bang, bang, bang
Blow down the new slang
You can't keep all the money you stole
And it all adds up
And it all adds up

You know I love it
When you say you're afraid
Don't you hate it
When I'm making you shake?
Hang the truth from a noose
Put a hit man on the loose
Now you're counting on him
