(Never again, never give in, never give in
Never again, never give in, never give in)

I wouldn't wish this on just anyone
But you seem to share my impulse
I wouldn't take this from just anyone
But you seem to like the results

I'll connect the dots
And you can tell me when to stop
But I'd rather keep on going
Than be something that I'm not

We're creatures of habit
We can't live without it
We don't have to answer to anyone
We're chasing the rabbit
Like creatures of habit
And no one else knows where we're comin' from

And nothing's ever gonna change
'Cause I ain't gonna run away
There's no need to panic
'Cause you're just as tragic
We're creatures of habit
We don't have to answer to anyone

But under the circumstances
(Never again, never give in)
You be the recluse
I will defend you
When you've used up all your chances

I'll connect the dots
And you can tell me when to stop
But I'd rather keep on going
Than be something that I'm not

We're creatures of habit
We can't live without it
