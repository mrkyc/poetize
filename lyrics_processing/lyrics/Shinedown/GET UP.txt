I know you're clinging to the light of day
To tell you everything's A-okay
And medication don't do much
Yeah, it just numbs the brain

Guess you might say I'm a little intense
I'm on the bright side of being hell-bent
So, take it from me: You're not the only one
Who can't see straight (Can't see straight)

If you were ever in doubt
Don't sell yourself short
You might be bulletproof
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed
But you gotta try
And I'm calling out:

"Get up, get up, get a move on

'Cause I believe you can be whatever
And I agree you can do much better, trust me" (Trust me)

Everybody wants to sing their song
So, Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?"
Ain't nothing normal when it comes to you and me
I'd rather twist myself in knots

Don't sell yourself short
You might be bulletproof
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed
But you gotta try

Yeah, I don't know why I never talk about it
I guess that's probably part of the problem
Yeah, sometimes, you're wrong
Sometimes, you're right
I'm just gonna keep moving
Yeah, I'm just gonna keep moving
Today, tomorrow, and the next

Get up, get up, get a move on
Get up, get up, what's taking so long?
Get up, get up, get a move on
