Beast mode
Everybody's strikin' a pose
Everybody's taxin' my soul
They say it's all the rage
To never act your age

So, what you gonna hit me with next?
Darwin or a crucifix?
So, why you wanna do me like this?
It's always so extreme
But what's it really mean?

When you're beggin' for a brick
Just to throw it back and forth
And you call each other sick
Yet you're comin' back for more
Back for more of what you love
Back for more of what you hate
You can't stop, stop, stop
'Cause you're already too late

So, you kill your conscience
Cry yourself to sleep
Kill your conscience
Better you than me
You're all plugged in
Ready and rehearsed
Do your best, do your worst
Show me where it hurts
Kill your conscience
(Conscience, conscience)
Kill your conscience
(Conscience, conscience)
Yeah, you're all plugged in
Ready and rehearsed
Do your best, do your worst
Show me where it hurts

Everybody's passin' the buck (The buck)
Prayin' that they're makin' the cut (The cut)
They'll sell you by the pound
And keep you underground

While you're scratchin' at the gate
Screamin', "Come on, let me in!"
Like a fully loaded zombie
Throwin' caution to the wind
Back for more of what you love
Back for more of what you hate
You can't stop, stop, stop
'Cause you're already too late

So, you kill your conscience
Cry yourself to sleep
Kill your conscience
Better you than me

Show me where it hurts
