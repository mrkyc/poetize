You can have the sound of
A thousand voices calling your name
You can have the light of the world
Blind you, bathe you in grace
But I don't see so easily
What you hold in your hands
'Cause castles crumble, kingdoms fall
And turn into sand

You can be an angel of mercy
Or give into hate
You can try to fight it just like
Every other careless mistake
How do you justify? I'm mystified
By the ways of your heart
With the million lies, the truth will rise
To tear you apart

Woah!

No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is, how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love?

Nothing ever feels quite the same
When you are what you dream
And you will never look at anything the same
When you see what I see
How we forget ourselves, lose our way
From the cradle to the grave
You can't replicate, or duplicate
Gotta find your own way

Yeah

No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is, how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?
