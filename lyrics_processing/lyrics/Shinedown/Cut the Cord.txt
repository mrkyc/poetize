Let me tell you: I'm vicious
Not passive-aggressive
I've got my finger on the pulse
Starin' straight into a hole, and I get it
And I'm a savage; it's automatic
I got a way of makin' noise
The power to destroy with no static

'Cause victory is all you need
So, cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness!)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty...

You gotta feel courage
Embrace possession
If it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered
But it's not, because it's your obsession
Be a fighter, backbone desire
Complicated, and it stings
But we both know what it means
And it's time to get real and inspired

'Cause victory is all you need
So, cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten
Just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness!)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty...
Cut the cord!
Cut it!
Cut it!
