Hurry up before you go and get old
Hurry up before your blood runs cold
None of us were ever meant to stay
We're all gonna find out one day

You see, life's too short to run it like a race
So, it's never gonna matter if you win first place
'Cause we're all the same

Stop waiting on your fifteen minutes of fame
'Cause you're not special
I'm not trying to rain on your parade
But you're not special
I'm not trying to bring you down
I'm not trying to sound so ineffectual
But you're not special

Hurry up before the bottle kicks in
Before the poison and the pain sets in (Get up, get up)
If you take it down a notch and you let me explain
That, on this earth, we are all the same

And all I can say is

Stop waiting on your fifteen minutes of fame
'Cause you're not special
I'm not trying to rain on your parade
But you're not special
I'm not trying to bring you down
I'm not trying to sound so ineffectual
'Cause you're not special

We all live to love, we all fall apart
We'd all go to war for the faint of heart
Instead, we're condescending
There are no happy endings
I won't hold my breath, I won't cast a doubt
I'd never sell you out
But I'll give you one last chance to own it
'Cause you're not a god or a poet, so...

Stop waiting on your fifteen minutes of fame
'Cause you're not special
I'm not trying to rain on your parade
But you're not special
I'm not trying to bring you down
I'm not trying to sound so ineffectual
But you're not special
(Get up, get up, get a move on)
(Get up, get up, ain't nothing wrong)
But you're not special
(Get up, get up, get a move on)
(Stop stalling, I'm calling out)
But you're not special
'Cause you're not special
