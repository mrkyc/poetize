(Attention, attention
An emergency has been reported...
Attention, attention)

Attention, attention
Get down on the floor
Don't reach for your pockets
Don't run for the door
The tension, the tension
It's urgent, it's real
The cameras are rolling
The envelope's sealed

Attention, attention
By the way, did I mention...?

The stories I hear are the stories I tell
Like jumping over buildings
And sneaking out of hell
Intention, retention
It's all in your head
That pretty little mistress
That's hiding in your bed

By the way, did I mention...?

Nothin' 'bout me is ordinary
My friends all say I'm going crazy
I don't hear a word that they say
'Cause the voices in my head are legendary
But I'll never tell 'em where the bodies are buried
Keeps them coming back every day

Oh, no, oh, no
They're just villains in my mind doing time
Oh, no, oh, no
They're just matches burning holes in my soul

Attention, attention
'Cause this ain't a stunt
The judge is a racist
The jury's corrupt
The shelves are all empty
But the seats are all filled
If you're a shiny new penny
I'm a hundred-dollar bill
Attention, attention
By the way, did I mention...?

Nothin' 'bout me is ordinary

Oh, no, oh, no
They're just villains in my mind doing time
Oh, no, oh, no
They're just matches burning holes in my soul
