And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
For me for me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
All of my days
For all of my nights
I want you baby boy
Come love me right
You are amazing
I can't stop dazing into your eyes
Uh babe you make me feel so high
I tingle in my chest everytime you're nearby
Boy can I trust you
Just want to love you
All of my days
So...
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go (let it go)
Straight to my lover's heart for me
