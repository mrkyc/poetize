Heard a thousand lies
And it's just the same thing over and over
When will I ever learn
And I just can't take it, this pain
And now I'm breaking
I made a mistake trusting you
For all the years I put into this
What I deserve is more than what you can give
And it's just the same thing over and over and over
Over again
Cause after love there's after life
After the rain, the sleepless nights
After me and after you I'll have something
To look forward to
(After you)
Seems I put my trust into someone who
Couldn't put me first
Know my word, when will I ever learn
And you just don't get it, I'm done
But you gonna feel this when I'm gone
And it's all a little too late
(Too late, too late)
For all the years I put into this
What I deserve is more than what you can give
And it's just the same thing over and over and over
Over again
Cause after love there's after life
After the rain and sleepless nights
After me and after you I'll have something
To look forward to
I'm a fly, I'm a fight
I'm a be just fine
I'm a do alright without you
Goodbye, goodbye
No more sleepless nights
I got a life to live without you
I'm a fly, I'm a fight
I'm a be just fine
I'm a do alright without you
Goodbye, goodbye
I'm a be alright
I got a life to live without you
I'm ready
I'm ready to move on
Ready to? sling? on
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
Cause after love there's after life
After the rain and sleepless nights
After me and after you I'll have something
To look forward to
(I'm a be fine, I'm a be alright)
Cause after love there's after life
After the rain and sleepless nights
After me and after you I'll have something
