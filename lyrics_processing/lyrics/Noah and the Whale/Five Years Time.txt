With the sun shining down over me and you
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through
And there'll be sun sun sun
All over our bodies
And sun sun sun
All down our necks
And there'll be
Sun sun sun
All over our faces
And sun sun sun
So what the heck
Cos I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes
And drink stupid wine
Cos it's what we needed to have a good time
And it was fun fun fun
When we were drinking
It was fun fun fun
When we were drunk
And it was fun fun fun
When we were laughing
It was fun fun fun
Oh it was fun
You might also likeOh well I look at you and say
It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say
Yah well I feel all pretty happy too
And I'm always pretty happy
When I'm just kicking back with you
And it'll be
Love love love
All through our bodies
And love love love
All through our minds
And it'll be Love love love
All over her face
And Love love love
All over mine
Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking 'bout them as I'm lying in bed
And all that I believe it might never really come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you
Oh
In five years time
I might not know you
In five years time
We might not speak
Oh
In five years time
We might not get along
In five years time
You might just prove me wrong
Oh there'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love love love
