I know you got your own town
I know you got your own ways
I know you got your own life
I'm just sayin' come on down to my place
Come on make some new friends
And tell me what you drinkin'
I know there's no place like home
But i know you gonna like it in my city

Everybody's welcome here
Everybody welcome to my city
We ain't got no worries here
I know you're gonna like it in my city
You know you got a friend in me
You ain't gonna wanna leave
Co-co-co-come on, co-co-co-come-on
You ain't never had a party
Till you come to a party in my city

Driving down to boulevard
Coming out inside my car
No sitting in my backyard
Let's go for a ride
Come on and ride with me
We got some sights to see
Baby just come with me to my community
Come on let's go, Let's hit the road
Oh, Turn up your radio
Blast the radio
We do it all night long
We got everything you and me
Music plays all night long
I know you're gonna like it in my city

Everybody's welcome here
Everybody welcome to my city
We ain't got no worries here
I know you're gonna like it in my city
You know you got a friend in me
You ain't gonna wanna leave
Co-co-co-come on, co-co-co-come-on
You ain't never had a party
Till you come to a party in my city

When you're here the city is yours
Let the music play, dance tonight away
Eh eh eh eh eh eh everybody into my city
Come on in, let's enjoy
Let the music play, dance tonight away
Eh eh eh eh eh everybody into my city
Come on and welcome to my city

Everybody's welcome here
Everybody welcome to my city
We ain't got no worries here
I know you're gonna like it in my city
You know you got a friend in me
You ain't gonna wanna leave

You ain't never had a party
