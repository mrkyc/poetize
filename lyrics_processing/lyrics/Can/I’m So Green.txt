Looking for the truth to speak
Just like in my home
Smiling face like hmm-hmm
Those lights becoming many
Those lights back at home
Those lights that make you make it home again
Those lights back there
Yes, I feel everything
I'm so green, I'm so green
Yes, I feel everything you say
Yes, I feel as you said
Trace lights, they're just going short all the time
Take back any, sense to grey
I'm so green, yeah, I'm so green
I'm so green, I'm so green
I feel everything
I feel everything you say
I feel everything you hear
I feel everything you hear
I'm gonna get them
I feel everything
I feel everything
I feel everything
In place with the gold
In with the gold
In with the gold
In with the gold
I feel the end
I feel the end
Where the place that they go
Where the place takes to you
