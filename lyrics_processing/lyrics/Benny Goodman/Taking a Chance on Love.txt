Here I go again;
I hear those trumpets blow again;
All aglow again - taking a chance on love
Here I slide again;
About to take that ride again.;
Starry eyed again - taking a chance on love
I thought the cards were a frame-up
I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high
Things are mending now;
I see a rainbow blending now;
We'll have our happy ending now
Taking a chance on love
You might also like2
Here I come again;
I'm gonna make things hum again;
Acting dumb again - taking a chance on love
Here I stand again;
About to beat the band again;
Feeling grand again - taking a chance on love
I never dreamed in my slumbers
And bets were taboo
But now I'm playing the numbers
On a little dream for two
Wading in again;
I'm leading with my chin again;
I'm startin' out to win again
Taking a chance on love

Here I slip again;
About to take that tip again;
Got my grip again
Taking a chance on love
Now I prove again;
That I can make life move again;
In the grove again
Taking a chance on love
I walk around with a horseshoe
In clover I lie
And brother rabbit of course you
Better kiss your foot goodbye!
On the ball again;
I'm riding for a fall again;
I'm gonna give my all again
Taking a chance on love
