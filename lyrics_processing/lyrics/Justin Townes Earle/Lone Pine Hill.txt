Held up in the middle of the night
Shakin like a pistol in a young mans hand
There in the pale moonlight
Standin up the top of that lonely hill
Spared by the company mines
Is my blue eyed baby with her best dress on
In the shadow of a lonely pine
It was back before the war
When the company came
These hills grew wild and free
Me and baby we'd hide in the hollers low
Away from the cruel sun's heat
But then they knocked down the timber
And burned off the brush
To get to the riches below
And when they pulled out
They left a cold black ground
And one pine standing lone
So take me home...
Lone pine hill
I signed up back in '61
I'm an army of Virginia man
I've been from Mannasas to Mackonackey
All the way to Sailors Creek fighting
For my home land
After 4 years gone and all hope lost
And Richmond under seige
And we're diggin out Five Forks
And waitin in the rain
For Sheridan to bring us to our knees
So take me home...
Lone pine hill
There's a strange moon hangin' overhead tonight
And if the rain keeps comin then the creek's gonna rise
With the good lord's grace
I'll make it outta this place and
I'll be in your arms come the morning light I swear...
So god grant me speed and grant me forgiveness
And carry me on through the night
Take me through your hills and over your rivers
Away from this awful fight
Cause I ain't never known a man that's ever owned another
Ain't never owned nothin' of my own
And after 4 long years I just can't tell you
What the hell I've been fighting for...
So take me home...
