Put on his daddy's old suit with a second hand shirt
All untucked, shoes untied, the people all snickered as he walked by
So he stopped in a bar, bought a shot of Stevens, and another
He bummed a cigarette, and sat talking with a stranger about the weather
And then he paid his bill and he stepped outside, fell down into the street
He cursed, and he cried as he climbed back up to his feet again
So up the road he found a payphone and called his mom
He said, "Mama I think I'll be coming home
I been feeling so bad, and tired of this city
Ain't been the same since I lost my pretty Angeline, Mama I miss her so
It's been over a year and there ain't nothing I fear so much as being alone."
And then he hung up the phone without saying good-bye
Stopped in a store and bought a postcard and signed it
"Fare thee well", and sent it back home to Yuma
Lookin' back I'd say, it wasn't so much the girl
As it was the booze and the dope
And the way he took the weight of the world up upon his shoulders
And let it wash the blue from his eyes as he grew colder
As through all those lonely nights there left alone
So he was just 23 when he stepped out on that ledge
It was his weary heart that pushed him to the edge
He was tired of living life, looking for love
"A weary heart just needs a little touch
And is it too much to ask?", he cried as he stepped into the wind
He turned his back on the world and he fell back to Earth again

He crashed through the hood of an Olds '98
And he lay there dying on a cold winter's day all alone
