Yeah, yeah

I say, bless me with a heart of gold
A positivity and a story to be told
I tripped, fell down through the sky
It's what it took for me to learn how to fly
Like, oh yeah
Let my spirit fly
My intentions are not to intoxicate but purify
Give me truth, or every time I hear a lie
Joy be the only reason I get teary eyed
Imagine all Lennon had to say
To make us want to pray for peace every single day
Keep your money don't want anything to do with it
Reach your love, heart of gold, and I'm never losing this

Curious whatchu gonna do?
Lost for words and you find you really don't care at all
I said you really don't care at all
I'm just curious, whatchu gonna do?
Lost for words and you find you really don't care at all
I said you really don't care at all
You might also like
I look in the mirror to figure out who I am
I thought I was a boy but I guess I am a man
I burnt a bridge, but that's what it took for me to build a dam
I hang my head, I don't want to be that kind of man
No, no, that's not how my daddy raised me
Work your ass off boy don't ever be lazy
I owned it on the ball field, so my pa praised me
You could never beat me down or you could never phase me
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Even in the rough yeah you gotta see it through
Have a nice trip though, I'll see you next fall
The only thing I know is that I know nothing at all
Just...


My feet are innocent
My soul it understands
My feet are innocent
My soul yeah it understands
Oh you know that my soul yeah, understand, understands
I said sometimes feelings can be hard to understand
But if we understood them there'd be no point to the plan
I reach out with my hand
And to all of my fans
To let you know that if you fall
I will help you stand
To let you know that everyday I feel similar pain
The purpose of my music is to take it all away
So I say, salute you freedom fighters
Wave your flags high for
Liberty we will die for
Driftin' in the pursuit of happiness that we drive towards
A better future my people and me will strive towards
I'm lost, I find myself while I search
Now I use music to pray with no words
When you lose what you love, remember to stay strong
Look out the window and remember life goes on


My feet are innocent
My soul it understands
My feet are innocent
My soul yeah it understands
