You called me, said he broke your heart again
Won't you let me pick up the pieces?
Let me pick up all the pieces baby
You said even though you're not with him
That your life's too complicated
When you're in this situation
There's not much that I can say to you
But I would never lie
As long as I've got you next to me
Tonight I've got to try

I'm giving you the X's (X's)
I'm giving you the O's (O's)
I'm giving you everything in between
I've saved it all for you
So hit me with a yes (yes)
You gotta let me know (know)
I wanna be everything that you need
I'll never let you go

I'm giving you the...
And I'm giving you a...
So I'm giving you the...
Yeah, I'm giving you a...

I don't wanna go too fast
But it's really hard to take it slow
When you feel the way that I do
Whenever I'm around you
Girl you're beautiful
And I know that I could make you feel
Like you're sittin' on top of the world
And if you gave me half a chance
I know I'd make you mine

I'm giving you the X's (X's)
I'm giving you the O's (O's)
I'm giving you everything in between
I saved it all for you
So hit me with a yes (yeah)

Click click, like a Cupid on a rampage
Bang, bang put it right through my rib cage
Pinky, ring, middle finger down with the thumb
A simple way to let you know that you're my number one
Chirp, chirp like a bird cause you're so fly
I wanna study your anatomy, Bill Nye
I'll show you I can shake you harder than a bass drum
I'm not a cable guy but I know how to get it done

I'm giving you the X's (X's)
I'm giving you the O's (O's)
I'm giving you everything in between
I saved it all for you
So hit me with a yes (yeah)
You gotta let me know (know)
