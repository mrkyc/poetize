You should roll with me
Whatcha got to lose?
I can make your teenage dream come true
And all I wanna know is if you're feeling me or not
Cause I'm looking at the clock, it goes tick-tick-tock
I wanna make you my lady
I ain't tryna' hear no "Call Me Maybe"
I ain't never seen a girl so sweet
I could be your surfboard, you could be my beach

You spend all night lookin' down at your phone
Girl, you need to get over it (you need to get over it, yeah)
Just one kiss then we both go with the flow
I'm a help you get over it (help you get over it, yeah)

You don't gotta wait no longer
You don't gotta be so shy
I just wanna pull you closer
I just wanna cross that line
So baby, come on
Cause the night is almost over
So let's have the time of our lives
Like we got nothing to lose
You know what I'm saying, I hope you feel the same, yeah
(Like we got nothing to lose)
You know what I'm saying, I hope you feel the same, yeah
(Like we got nothing to lose)
You might also like
I can tell by the way that you rolling your eyes
You get a lot of attention
Probably fed up by guys
And I can try to convince you I'm different
But you look so good
It's hard to put together a sentence
Get it on, so if you could just imagine
What's going through my head
And all the fun we'd have
If you give me a chance
I can promise you this
You won't be singing break up songs like that Taylor chick

You spend all night lookin' down at your phone
Girl, you need to get over it (you need to get over it, yeah)
Just one kiss then we both go with the flow
I'm a help you get over it (help you get over it, yeah)

You don't gotta wait no longer
You don't gotta be so shy
I just wanna pull you closer
I just wanna cross that line
So baby, come on
Cause the night is almost over
So let's have the time of our lives
Like we got nothing to lose
You know what I'm saying, I hope you feel the same, yeah
(Like we got nothing to lose)
You know what I'm saying, I hope you feel the same, yeah
(Like we got nothing to lose)
I mean considering the fact that we're at a high school party right now
And I'm not in high school
Neither are you
So, I mean we could just, uhm go back to to my house
Yeah, so

You don't gotta wait no longer
You don't gotta be so shy
I just wanna pull you closer
I just wanna cross that line
So baby, come on
Cause the night is almost over
So let's have the time of our lives
Like we got nothing to lose
You know what I'm saying, I hope you feel the same, yeah
(Like we got nothing to lose)
You know what I'm saying, I hope you feel the same, yeah
(Like we got nothing to lose)

You know what I'm saying, I hope you feel the same, yeah
