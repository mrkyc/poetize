I take a puff of my cigarillo
Then I say what up like, "Hello."
Party hard, pedal to the metal
A part of growing up is living like a rebel
No stoppin' the girls from teeny-boppin'
No tops, just rockin' bikini bottoms
Backyard boxin', half pipe droppin'
The jocks and the nerds man everybody's rockin'

And when we are all looking back
(One day when we're lookin' back)
We'll think of this night so let's make it last

Cause we're teenage kings pretending we're famous
And we won't leave til someone gets shameless
It's a five-day fight til the Saturday night
When the guys get hyped and the girls get low
Teenage kings pretending we're famous, yeah

I take a sip of another Red Bull
Everybody on the move lookin for someone to XO
Everything is good, and everything is cool
Except for the fool who fell into the pool
What up ladies, I'm glad that you could stop by
Freshmen trippin' out because you got high
And daisy dukes when you walk by, I swat thighs
Let the good times roll and let the top fly
You might also like
And when we are all looking back
(One day when we're lookin back)
We'll think of this night so let's make it last

Cause we're teenage kings pretending we're famous
And we won't leave til someone gets shameless
It's a five-day fight til the Saturday night
When the guys get hyped and the girls get low
Teenage kings pretending we're famous, yeah

Nina with Josie, with Jack McColl
Jay's actin dumb runnin into walls
Someone's passed out with the candle
We're rollin, we're rollin, like teenage kings

And when we are all looking back
We'll think of this night so let's make it last

Cause we're teenage kings pretending we're famous
And we won't leave til someone gets shameless
It's a five-day fight til the Saturday night
When the guys get hyped and the girls get low
Teenage kings pretending we're famous, yeah
Na-na-na-na-na
Everybody sing
Na-na-na-na-na
Everybody sing
Someone's passed out with the candle
