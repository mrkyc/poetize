Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Tonight, I can see it in your eyes
I'm gonna give it to you right
I'm gonna give it to you right
I'm obsessed, that's fine
You could even say I'm out of line
But it's heaven when I am inside
It's heaven when I am inside

Forever is too much
But baby when we touch
Our sensations go overload, oh oh
Can't shake the thought of your body ridin' on top of me
Like a bomb we're 'bout to explode
Oh oh, oh oh

Give you all that I have tonight
I can us going for a ride
Your love's like a bird so high
Baby you're the best
Got me so obsessed, yeah
Dim the lights, turnin' off your phone
Knock me down like a domino
And turn me on like the radio
Baby you're the best
Got me so obsessed, yeah
Yeah yeah eh, yeah yeah eh, yeah yeah eh
Baby you're the best
Got me so obsessed, yeah

She said she gonna spend the night
Got me feelin' like a Red Bull, takin' flight
And we gon' soar to new heights
What we're doin's so wrong but it feels so right
And that body's so delicious
