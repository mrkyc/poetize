I don't need to be impressive, I don't need to run the game
I don't want to keep on chasing, let it all just come my way
But hey-aye everything's gonna be alright, alright
I don't need no bumping music, all I need is my guitar
I don't need no late night cruising, I don't even got a car
But hey-aye everything's gonna be alright, alright

I wanna lay low, not just cause I'm broke
I wanna stay home and have a kick back tonight
Sorry not sorry, am I (I, I ooh)

Let's ditch the party ignore everybody
And we'll make spaghetti and it'd be all heady
Like, aye-aye everything's gonna be alright, alright
So don't fear tomorrow, let that be the motto
And just pass the bottle and we'll make it hollow
Like, aye-aye everything's gonna be alright, alright, tonight

I don't want no debby downer, I just wanna keep my buzz
I don't wanna know no drama, we don't gotta trip because
Aye-aye everything's gonna be alright, alright
