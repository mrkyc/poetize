Pull me in just like a rip tide
Yeah
Oh go ahead and
Drown me with your sweet soul
My heart is like a split divide
Half of it beats for me
While the other half beats for you

See it was me and Jose Cuerve with Jay D at a party
Sippin' Bacardi we've been dreaming a lot of pina coladas
So pour me a shot of tequila
We're rockin', droppin' sake poems like a kamikazi
Champagne champion no trippin, we're sippin
Forget your sorry
Fill me up the margarita
Grindin' with the senorita
OJ Grey Goose screw drivin' screws loose
Wanna grow love?
Plant two lips on tulips
Come on baby
Give me mucho Besos and smooches
We're teeny boppin oh
Booty poppin oh
Pink panty droppin oh
Mimosas and daiquiris with cherries on top of 'em
Rockin' with the best from the east to the wild wild west coast
Sing the chorus for me Wes
You might also like
Woah, woah
Pull me in just like a rip tide
I said woah woah
Go ahead and drown me with your sweet soul
I said woah woah woah woah
My heart is like a split divide baby
Half of it beats for me
While the other half beats for you

When life hands you lemons take the lemons and bail
We put em in the necks of our Corona's and sail
Like rickety-rocka-di
Tickety-tocka-di
The Red Bull and Vodka's got the party rockin
We're groovin to the music and you're movin and you're losin
You're infused up in the tunes and now the energy is cruisin
She's so sweet, yeah
My baby like a mango
Rose in my mouth well it takes two to tango
Bingo, bango, ba-ba-ba-bongo
Welsey's banging dirty beats on the bongo

Woah, woah
Pull me in just like a rip tide
I said woah woah
Go ahead and drown me with your sweet soul
I said woah woah woah woah
My heart is like a split divide baby
Half of it beats for me
While the other half beats for you
Woah, woah, woah, wooah
Woah, woah, woah, wooah
Woah, woah, woah, wooah
Woah, woah, woah, wooah

I'm on that couch in the back
Puffin on this reflex
Got that ukulele and a pretty lady on my lap
Kiss kiss, cheek cheek
Wanna plant one in between
She's my beauty queen
Pretty eys gona green
A black dress look at she
Victoria's Secret love spell so enchanting
Romance me, slow dance me, fancy
When you get a chance can you advance to the next beat

Woah, woah
Pull me in just like a rip tide
I said woah woah
Go ahead and drown me
I said woah woah woah woah
My heart is like a split divide baby
Half of it beats for me
