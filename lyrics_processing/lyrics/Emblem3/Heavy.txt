I knew from the start, the start
All of the struggles that we go through
They may scar my heart
But in the end it's what will make you

Who we are who we are
At the end of the day
Are we are what we are
Are we who we say oh
Who we are who we are
At the end of the day
At the end of the day, day

This world is so heavy, oh
Don't know if I'm ready, oh
I can feel it like the waves crashing down
I know I need to reach up not to drown
This world is so heavy

I can see it in your eyes
You and me can live a thousand lives
Comin' in like the endless tide
Sitting in the sand laying side by side
Even thought I know things ain't perfect
You're the one that let me know it's worth it
And I said it a million times
As long as we're together everything's alright
I reach for the stars, the stars
No matter how far the journey takes you
I'll stand tall so tall
Because I know they'll never breakthrough
You might also like
Who we are who we are
At the end of the day
Are we are what we are
Are we who we say oh
Who we are who we are
At the end of the day
At the end of the day, day

This world is so heavy, oh
Don't know if I'm ready, oh
I can feel it like the waves crashing down
I know I need to reach up not to drown
This world is so heavy, oh
Don't know if I'm ready, oh
I can feel it like the waves crashing down
I know I need to reach up not to drown
This world is so heavy

This world is so heavy
