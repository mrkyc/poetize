There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore

I feel your heart beating (boom, boom, boom)
Put in my car keys and (vroom, vroom, vroom)
I smell your fragrance like flowers in full bloom
I savor your flavor like (ooh, ooh, oooh)
Wave at you through my window (ooh, ooh, ooh)
We act like we're just friends though (ooh, ooh, ooh)
These games, these innuendos
And I can't get you outta my mind, and I can't get you out

There's something 'bout the girl next door (Hey)
Something that I can't ignore (Hey)
She got me like 'Oooh'
She got me like 'Oooh'

Now I'm at your door (knock, knock, knock)
Now we're on the floor, you on top, top, top
We can be the party come on let's (rock, rock, rock)
I'm dreaming, I'm feelin' like (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've seen you with no makeup (ooh, ooh, ooh)
So stoked that you're my neighbor (ooh, ooh, ooh)
So close I can almost taste ya and I can't get you out my mind and I can't get you out
