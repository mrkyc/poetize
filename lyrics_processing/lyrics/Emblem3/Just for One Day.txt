I wanna wake up on the beach
Wake up with you by my side
We could spend the AM, blankets tight
You just tell me where, and I can take you there
Straight broke living like billionaires
On the beach, wake up make away the stars
Wanna watch the water trickle down your arms
You just tell me where, and I can take you there
With the top down, hands up, wind in your hair

Like, oh, you're my Lucy in the sky
Ooh
And there's diamonds in your eyes

We, we could be one love
We could be one life
Just for one day (Hands up if you're down with the dream)
We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
Just for one day, ooh

Yeah
And baby, this could be a dream
The kind to make you smile all night
And I'm the kind of guy to make the dream real life
So tell me where you are
You know I'll send a car
A jet set from your house straight to the stars
Like a dream
Colors of the best sunset
Yeah, color California cause the coast is west
So tell me where you at, in 20 seconds flat
We'll be top down, hands up, never look back

Just for one day (Hand up if you're down with the dream)
We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away
Just for one day-ay
Just for one day-ay
Just for one

With you we'll be underneath the stars
Baby, drinkin' champagne, eatin' caviar
One day with you in the deep blue sea
Cause it's me and you, yeah it's you and me

We, we could be one love
We could be one light
Just for one day
We, we could be one love
We could be one light
Just for one day (Hands up if you're down with the dream)
We, we could be one heart
We only got one life
So let's get away (Hands up, Hands up yeah)
