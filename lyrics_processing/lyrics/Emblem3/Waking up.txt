All the time, where'd it go
Been lacking all the light we need to grow
Let it shine, let it glow (oh oh woah)
This war inside, we're terrified
Breaking down these walls inside the mind
Bring fire in a world of snow (oh oh woah)

Let's follow the road
That leads us to the dreaming
Wherever we go
I know we won't be sleeping

Wake oh wake up
Look at all beautiful
Wake awake
We're stars under the telescope
I know, I know
We can ditch the cynical
Wake oh wake up
In middle of the mystical
All we got are reflections of the sun
So here's out shot
We're finally waking up (we're waking up!)

Sleeping nights, open wide
Waking up to all the wonder here
Who am I? Now I know (oh oh woah)
So come alive, and feel the ride
Taking us to where we need to be
Rise and shine, come let's go (oh oh woah)

Let's follow the road
That leads us to the dreaming
Wherever we go
I know we won't be sleeping

Wake oh wake up
Look at all beautiful
Wake awake
We're stars under the telescope
I know, I know
We can ditch the cynical
Wake oh wake up
In middle of the mystical
All we got are reflections of the sun
So here's out shot
We're finally waking up (we're waking up!)
We'll build a love to last a lifetime
Live in the skies
We'll elevate no one can ever bring us down
No mistaking we're awaken
Oh woah oh woah oh
No mistaking we're awaken
Oh woah oh woah oh
No mistaking we're awaken

Let's follow the road
That leads us to the dreaming
Wherever we go
I know we won't be sleeping

Wake oh wake up
Look at all beautiful
Wake awake
We're stars under the telescope
I know, I know
We can ditch the cynical
Wake oh wake up
In middle of the mystical
All we got are reflections of the sun
So here's out shot
We're finally waking up (we're waking up!)
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
We're finally waking up (we're waking up!)
Oh woah oh, oh woah oh
