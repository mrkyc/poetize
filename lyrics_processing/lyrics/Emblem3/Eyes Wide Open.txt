Cold drinks warm cheeks
It makes it so easy
Blue sky's your eyes
Promise just don't leave me

3 hits 2 drinks
One you one me
Bayside late night
Lay back in my arms
Let it fade by gotta broken heart
You can take mine

Don't gotta tell me twice
If wanna leave tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
I don't wanna miss a thing
Said hold in your breath
Cuz we're gunna take the dive
Never let the feelin die I
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
I don't wanna miss a thing
You might also like
Fragile moments
Slipping through my hands
I don't wanna miss a thing
Forever falls through
My fingers like sand
I don't wanna miss a thing
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
I don't wanna miss a thing
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
I don't wanna miss a thing

Too hot no chill
Why you always tease me
Full moon best vibe
Your smile best high
Somethin' bout it frees me

3 dots right hand
These marks life plan
All for la vida loco
Too often we miss the moment
Make me wanna throw my phone in the ocean
Don't gotta tell me twice
If wanna leave tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
I don't wanna miss a thing

Fragile moments
Slipping through my hands
I don't wanna miss a thing
Forever falls through
My fingers like sand
I don't wanna miss a thing
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
I don't wanna miss a thing
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
Never let the feeling die
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
And I don't wanna sleep tonight
Gotta keep my eyes wide open
Oh I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna miss a thing
Forever falls through my fingers like sand
I don't wanna miss a thing
Fragile moments
