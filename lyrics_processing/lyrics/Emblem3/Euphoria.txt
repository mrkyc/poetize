Used to love me so hard, leave me in a haze
My lotus garden petals in the face
So we drop the pen then we head to outer space
Yeah I brought the gin, well I hope you brought the chase
The high is setting in when I feel you vibrate
This life we're livin' in guess we'll see how far it bends
'Til I push every limit 'til it breaks
Hold up, I'm feeling something nice right now
Don't you dare think for a second, just roll with it
Like a mosh pit tearing up the crowd
I embrace the chaos and I take control of it
Oh, yeah, I'm young gunnin', young gunnin' still up on my wave
Bet it's one hundred, one hundred straight on 'til the grave
And all of those movements you make baby
They drive me in fucking sane hold up, hold up
I'm feelin somethin nice right now
Think I got some vertigo (Woah)
Which way is up? I don't know
Yeah, I'm fifty drunk and fifty stoned
My skin is red, my heart is gold
This type of life is all we know
This type of life is all we know
Yeah, the feds they got my iPhone tapped from that time
I tweeted fuck the capital was feeling bold like every time
I send a stupid text to my ex
I miss more than just the sex
I miss holding you on sunsets and lifting up that sundress

It was too tight barely fit around your legs
You were hitting squats like every single day
Tryna drive me crazy, oh my God it's working
Take me for a ride, watch your head spin away
Take me for a ride, watch your head spin away
Hold up, I'm feeling something nice right now
Don't you dare think for a second, just roll with it
Like a mosh pit tearing up the crowd
I embrace the chaos and I take control of it
Oh, yeah, I'm young gunnin', young gunnin' still up on my wave
Bet it's one hundred, one hundred straight on 'til the grave
And all of those movements you make baby
They drive me in fucking sane hold up, hold up
I'm feelin' somethin nice right now
(I'm feelin' somethin nice)
I'm feelin' somethin nice right now
(I'm feelin' somethin nice)
Hold up, hold up, Hold up, hold up
(I'm feelin' somethin nice)
I'm feelin' somethin nice right now
Like a mosh pit tearing up the crowd
I embrace the chaos and I take control of it
Oh, yeah, I'm young gunnin', young gunnin' still up on my wave
Bet it's one hundred, one hundred straight on 'til the grave
And all of those movements you make baby
They drive me in fucking sane hold up, hold up
