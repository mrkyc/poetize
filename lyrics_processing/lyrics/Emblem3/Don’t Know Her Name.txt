Huh, huh, no no
Ended up at my place, she'd never told me her name
When I woke up I was alone
I don't understand but, made her run away cause
I felt like JJ, we share the same soul

I wish, I would've asked what she's about
But she, snuck out the back when the sun came out

Really wished that she had stayed
Could've never left the bed all day
Oh, but I don't even know her name
Don't even know her, I I don't even know her name
Don't know her name, no oh

Running down my street, asking everybody
And they all tell me I'm out of my mind
Staring at the ceiling, I can't shake this feeling
She forgot me and she's doing alright

No no I wish, I would've asked what she's about
But she, snuck out the back when the sun came out
You might also like
Really wished that she had stayed
Could've never left the bed all day
Oh, but I don't even know her name
Don't even know her, I I don't even know her name
Wish I told her what she meant to me
Coulda had more than a memory
Oh, but I don't even know her name
Don't even know her, I I don't even know her name

You know you got me, all falling
Don't even know who you are, are
I've gotta find you, I really need to
You hold a piece of my heart, heart

I wish, I would've asked she's about
But she, snuck out the back when the sun came out

Really wished that she had stayed
Could've never left the bed all day, (never left the bed)
Oh, but I don't even know her name
Don't even know her, I I don't even know her name (I don't even know her name)
Wish I told her what she meant to me (wish I told her what she meant to me)
Coulda had more than a memory (so much more baby)
Oh, but I don't even know her name
Don't even know her oh, I I don't even know her name (don't know her name oh)
Don't know her name, don't know her name oh no no
Don't know her, don't know her name
I don't know her name, I don't know her name
No, I don't even know her name
I don't even know her name
