The city of blinding lights and starry eyes
I said now welcome to the city of angels, whoa
City of angels, whoa
I said I love my women like I love my juice naked
All natural, no preservatives or fakeness
I like my ladies like I like my Brady's in bunches
I got the 6 pack I ain't talking about the crunches
Hit it till I quit it like Tyson's punches
That's how you gotta rock if you wanna run sh
Sweat make it less fizzy
Buzz kill Betty got me dolly dolly dizzy
Lost in her eyes like oh my God where is she?
Down here in SoCal boy we gettin' busy in the city
We gettin' busy in the city-y-y
Let's take a trip to Sunset Boulevard in the city of stars
The city of blinding lights and starry eyes
I said now welcome to the city of angels, whoa
City of angels, whoa
I said a bright future reflects off my aviators
Here's a peace sign going out to all my haters
High five Keaton, no hurt hand
When we get samples at Yogurtland
Then we chill soon, talk about Betty Blomby
Kill Bruce, play Call of Duty Zombies, yeah
She's started to get the best of me
While she makes her mind up whether she wants me or Wesley
