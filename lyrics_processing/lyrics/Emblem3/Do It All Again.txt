Soon as I walked into the party, this girl came up to me and started to dance
Had a tattoo on her neck and a ring in her tongue and some tight leather pants
After the song, she pulled me in the bathroom and locked it and turned off the lights
Then when I turned them back on, she was gone, but it wasn't the end of the night

And at twelve forty five, that's when my homies arrived
At a quarter to two everyone jumped in the pool
Now the suns gonna rise, we must've lost track of time
There won't be another tonight but as soon as it ends

We'll do it all again
We'll do it all again
No, we're not going home
Till the speakers are blown
Feeling like whoa
We'll do it all again
We'll do it all again
We'll be up in the clubs
Till the cops shut us down
Feeling like whoa
We'll do it all again

Soon as I woke up, I promised myself that I'd be staying in for the night
Said that'd I'd go back to sleep, but then I got a text from a girl that I like
She told me to go get a couple of friends and that she had a couple of friends
Now we in the car on the way to the party 'bout to do it again

We'll do it all again

We'll do it all again
We'll be up in the clubs
Till the cops shut us down
Feeling like whoa
We'll do it all again

(We'll do it all again
We'll do it all again
We'll do it all again
We'll do it all again)

We'll do it all again
We'll do it all again
