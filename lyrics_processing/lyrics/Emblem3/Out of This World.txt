Zero to infinity
Yeah that's how much you mean to me
When you pull me down like gravity
And spin me round like Saturn's ring
Saturns rings

Got your head in the heavens
And feet rooted in the earth
Love is a blessing but sometimes it fucking hurts
Whenever I feel alone in the universe
Yeah-eah
I look up and see all these lights
Dancing in the sky at night
Reminding me that love's not blind
And we're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?
I look up into all these lights
Dancing in the sky at night
Reminding me that love's not blind
And we're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?

You're out of this world
Out of this world
You're out of this world
We're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?
You're out of this world
You might also like
Can you feel the energy?
The endless possibilities
Like you're from another galaxy
Yeah, you know how to set me free
Set me free

Got your head in the heavens
And feet rooted in the earth
Love is a blessing but sometimes it fucking hurts
Whenever I feel alone in the universe
Yeah-eah
I look up and see all these lights
Dancing in the sky at night
Reminding me that love's not blind
And we're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?
I look up to all these lights
Dancing in the sky at night
Reminding me that love's not blind
And we're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?

You're out of this world
Out of this world
You're out of this world
We're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?
You're out of this world
Out of this world
You're out of this world
We're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?
You're out of this
Gettin' out of body out of mind that's find
You take me to another plane of space and time
Take the moment leave the rest behind
It won't be no waste of time
You see, the universe is yours and mine
I can see it when your windows are open wide
I can feel it when emotions climb, going up and it's so divine

I look up to all these lights
Dancing in the sky at night
Reminding me that love's not blind
And we're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?
I look up to all these lights
Dancing in the sky at night
Reminding me that love's not blind
And we're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?

You're out of this world
Out of this world
You're out of this world
We're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?
You're out of this world
(Gettin' out of body out of mind that's find
You take me to another plane of space and time
Take the moment leave the rest behind
It won't be no waste of time)
You're out of this world
You're out of this world
We're all made of star dust
Do you know what you are love?
