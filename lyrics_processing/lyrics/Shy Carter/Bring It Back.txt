Catch me out in somethin' bout like quarter after 2
I be pushin' buttons I be comin' down so cool
Know just whatchu lookin' at a certified young G
All you know is I be out here ballin' like a freak
I be stuntin' man, I be hustlin'
From Dubai to straight Dublin
I be buzzin' and I be bubblin' mane
Them diamonds steady be cuttin' out
The frame, it's nuthin'
Got sum mo'hitz in tha oven mane
That Memphis, Tennessee be gettin' it in!

Baby baby bring it back
Baby baby bring it back
Got 250 on the dash
Supa pimped out Cadillacs
I got sumthin' that'll smash
Baby baby bring it back
Baby baby bring it back
Finna show y'all where it's at
This dat bottom o da map
Bring that trill music back

Choppin' on them thangs like pimp and bun I gots to do it
Had to flip the script like Ceelo dis dat soulful gangsta music
Nelly from Missouri told me boi you got dat juice
And if I ever let a sucka tell me different I'm a lose it
We be stuntin' down in Atlanta
Diamond teeth all in your camera
Straight from Copenhagen to Tampa
This dat funk it ain't no sample
Don't be bitin' off of nobody
Matter fact they bitin' off me
Jumpin' ball & G and juvie overseas!

I'm a D.E.C.A.T.U.R. boy
808s bang bang out that car boy
Need a podiatrist feet kinda hard boy
Cadillac spaceship fly away to mars boy
I was just in a place so dark
'Til I was trapped in a bass guitar
Filled my tank up to make it far
Pole vaulting we raise this bar
And make this art, forever be relevant
Wet like tarp, Cheverolet elephant
Pimp so hard but she soft like gelatin
Avatar, blue dream inhaling it
Float away, on notes we play
These notes we play just congregates
So you feel great, F1 escape
We blast off now so don't be late
Come with me now upon this musical ride
Galactic sounds, they always come from inside
You'll be surprised at what you see when you
Open you eyes and your mind

Baby baby bring it back
Baby baby bring it back
Got 250 on the dash
