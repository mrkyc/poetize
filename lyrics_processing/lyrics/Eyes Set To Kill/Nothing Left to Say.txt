There's nothing left to say
Nothing that I can change
I threw my life away
I threw it all away
For nothing
No one to blame
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing
These voices won't keep quiet
These voices won't shut up
I'm so, sick and tired of trying
And always feeling like it's never enough
Never enough
Alexia Rodriguez
I wasted time, convincing myself
To think my path will soon unfold

Why don't you feel the pain that I feel?
Alexia Rodriguez
I'll shut my eyes and let my thoughts
Bury me until blood runs cold
I've fallen behind, but I still follow
(I threw it all away)
I follow the light until I'm hollow
(I threw it all away)
There's nothing you can say to change this

This broken smile will not fade
My mind keeps racing and I'm miles away
These eyes, these eyes
These eyes they shake of fear
They fear, they fear
They fear the end is
These eyes, these eyes
These eyes they shake of fear
They fear, they fear
They fear the end is near

There's nothing you can say to change this
So keep on running, keep on running
There's nothing you can say to change this

Remember the boy who said
He'd never stop running?
