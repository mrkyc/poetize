Dreams are falling apart as we're only holding on
Ambition gets old
When our hearts lie to us
Dreams are falling apart as we're only holding...
We gave our everything
We gave our everything
We gave our everything
All for our wanted dreams
We gave our everything
Lights dim down
We're the stars tonight
Their voices bring
Slight wind to the sky
Their voices sing along
Feel their souls lift with ours as they share the night
But you sing a different song
You sing a different song
Only holding on
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
Dreams are falling apart as we're only holding on
To a broken piece
We try to fit as one
Dreams are falling apart as we're only holding...

Lights dim down
We're the stars tonight
Their voices bring
Slight wind to the sky
Their voices sing along
Feel their souls lift with ours as they share the night
But you sing a different song
You sing a different song
Can't you see my grip is weakening?
Erasing every line
And taking down the frames
I'd look back but I'm too far away
A ghost to the faces I miss
Can't you see my grip is weakening?
Erasing every line
And taking down the frames
I'd turn back but I'm too far away
A ghost to the faces I miss
Lights dim down
We're the stars tonight

Slight wind to the sky
Their voices sing along
Feel their souls lift with ours as they share the night
But you sing a different song
You sing a different song
Have a little faith
I'll come back home
Don't forget my name
When I'm alone
A ghost to the faces I miss
