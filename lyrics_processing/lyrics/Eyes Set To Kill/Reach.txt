Hush don't speak a word about the dreams that I live for
It hurts to reach you when I'm down
Don't speak again, I'm still waiting for my turn
It hurts to reach you when i'm down

My dreams are growing into
Frustrations when i hear your voice
Feeding me 'til I'm choking, feeding me 'til I'm choking
My ears are ringing louder
Repeating words that bring me down
Ringing, my ears are bleeding, ringing, my ears are bleeding

So hold your breath and spare me
The pointless conversation, I'm running out of patience
Don't blame me for trying to (reach)

Hush don't speak a word about the dreams that I live for
It hurts to reach you when I'm down
Don't speak again, I'm still waiting for my turn
It hurts to reach you when i'm down

As you are moving forward
I feel as if i can't catch up
Trying so hard to reach you, trying so hard to reach you
I'm stuck here at the bottom
You're too high up to come back down
Trying so hard to reach you, trying so hard to reach you
