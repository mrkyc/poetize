I have to get away
Out of this place where I became the type
Who sits and laughs at everyone who judges me

It's so damn dark in here, I can't see in front of me
My flames have all burnt out my hopes no part of my reality
There's no escaping fear, I can't breathe, I'm struggling
My flames have all burnt out my hopes no part of my reality

There's something pulling me in the wrong direction
My confessions aren't at rest they can't get by
Oh no, cause these are deadly weapons, deadly weapons
Why must this perception take my breath? I can't get by
Oh no, cause these are deadly weapons, deadly weapons

With no direction to go, will my feet carry me?
To where I need to go to find myself the perfect remedy
Can I bare all of the weight of my mistakes? Give me strength!
Wherever will I go to find myself the perfect remedy

There's something pulling me in the wrong direction
My confessions aren't at rest they can't get by
Oh no, cause these are deadly weapons, deadly weapons
Why must this perception take my breath? I can't get by
Oh no, cause these are deadly weapons, deadly weapons

Now I can never take it back
Now I can never take it back
The truth might take us down
Lose ourselves in the sound
I won't want to hear your name
I won't want to see your face again
Words crumble to the ground
You'll blow the candles out
I won't want to hear your name
I won't bare to see your face again

There's something telling me I better take me chances
My confessions aren't at rest they can't get by
Oh no, cause these are deadly weapons, deadly weapons
Why must this perception take my breath? I can't get by
Oh no, cause these are deadly weapons, deadly weapons
My confessions aren't at rest they can't get by
Oh no, cause these are deadly weapons

I can't get by
I know there's something more, I know there's something more
I can't get by
I know there's something more, I know there's something more
Now I can never take this back
