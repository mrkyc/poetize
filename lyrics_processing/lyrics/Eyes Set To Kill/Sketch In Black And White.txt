The sounds of sirens are flooding the streets tonight
Yet we're all still willing to commit the crimes
Should we expect no consequence (No consequence)
Maybe our lies will pass the test (Will pass the test)

Eyes closed, hands tied (Behind our backs, we try)
To cover up (Our deepest secrets, and lies)
But we both know we are suspects to the crime
And running won't solve our problems this time

Your hands are shaking as they're holding on to mine
A sense of hesitation's hidden in your eyes

I've seen a sketch in black and white (In black and white)
I've seen the face you try to hide (You try to hide)

Behind the doors under the sheets
But you are guilty just like me
And none of us are innocent
A cycle of Russian Roulette

Eyes closed, hands tied (Behind our backs, we try)
To cover up (Our deepest secrets, and lies)
But we both know we are suspects to the crime
And running won't solve our problems this time

Pull up a seat, next to me
And let's face, the jury
Our only, chance to come clean
So what's it, going to be?

I've seen a sketch in black and white
I've seen the face you try to hide

Eyes closed, hands tied (Behind our backs, we try)
To cover up (Our deepest secrets, and lies)
But we both know we are suspects to the crime
And running won't solve our problems this time

I've seen a sketch in black and white
I'm the face you try to hide
Behind the doors under the sheets
But you are guilty just like me
Should we expect no consequence
Maybe our lies will pass the test
And none of us are innocent
