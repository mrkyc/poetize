But I want you to notice this case isn't closed
Doors are open, the lights are left on
And there's never a night I sleep
With the dreams that I'd have if you never decided, decided to leave
Decided, decided to leave
There's never an ounce that I breathe
Without thinking about who I could have been with you
There's never an ounce that I breathe
Without thinking about who I could have been if you didn't leave
The phones been patient to hear your call, but you never touched the dial
You never touched the dial and now I know
There's someone I wish walked through these halls
But you'll never take the chance to come home
So come home
We say we can learn from this
But I just don't know what to do without you anymore, anymore
Your absence is taking its toll on me
What I should believe, I just can't believe
There's never an ounce that I breathe
Without thinking about who I could have been with you
There's never an ounce that I breathe
Without thinking about who I could have been if you didn't leave

You say it isn't my fault so I steer away
I put off the pain for another day
Did you think it wouldn't be tough? 8 years were never enough
I'll wait for you
If you never change I will be okay
But I'll still stay up for you
Just in case you make the time for the right move
