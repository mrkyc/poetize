Make me feel alright
Hold me in your arms
Promise to never let go
Go until I
Decide it's time, our lives
Come down, come down
Come down to me tonight
I've come to find
You will never be mine
Lets keep the secrets between us
You and me
Rest those tired eyes
Tomorrow's a surprise
Lets keep the secrets between us
You and me
It's getting harder to hold my breath
Keep it in my chest
I'm sinking under the pressure
I wish that I could just take it back
Let that time pass
But now I'm stuck under pressure
Although you'll never be mine
Your secret's safe with me
