I told myself I'd give myself a break
But that can wait
'Cause I can't take my eyes off you
Damn you're just too cute
Can't turn down that Sunday fun day
Good thing we got all day Monday
I'm gonna be hungover
From hanging over here with you

You make me wanna drink
You make me wanna shoot some whiskey
Girl I'm starting to think
I might pull you in to kiss me
I just need me one more sip
That salty sweet right off your lips
You make me wanna drink
You make me wanna drink you up

If you're pouring then I'm going ten more rounds
There ain't no slowing me down when you look like that
I'm gonna go run up that tab

You make me wanna drink
You make me wanna shoot some whiskey
Girl I'm starting to think
I might pull you in to kiss me
I just need me one more sip
That salty sweet right off your lips
You make me wanna drink
You make me wanna drink you up

That salty sweet right off your lips
You make me wanna drink

If you're buzzing off a lime get your hands up
Girl I got you feeling good get your hands up
Wanna party just because get your hands up
Yeah, get your hands up, oh, get your hands up

You make me wanna drink
You make me wanna shoot some whiskey
Girl I'm starting to think
I might pull you in to kiss me
