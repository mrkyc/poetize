Why'd you let me pay the band, to play our favorite song again
Why'd you let me kiss your lips, let me think I had a chance
Why'd you let me pick you just to leave the scent of your perfume in my truck?
Why'd you wait to say what you said till your second glass of red?

Don't call me
Cause we been here before
Don't want me
If you don't want something more
Don't need me when you're lonely at 3 AM
Asking me to come over again, so I can hold you
Already told you, can't do that anymore
If you're gonna go, then go
Don't let my phone light up
I know you know I ain't strong enough
To keep myself from fallin'
Don't call me
Don't call me

Why'd you act so into me, sneaking out like we were seventeen
Why'd you let me have first and last dance, and the hundred in between?
Why'd you ask for promises that you knew you couldn't keep?
Why'd we make those front porch plans if you knew it wasn't me

Don't call me
Cause we been here before
Don't want me
If you don't want something more
Don't need me when you're lonely at 3 AM
Asking me to come over again, so I can hold you
Already told you, can't do that anymore
If you're gonna go, then go
Don't let my phone light up
I know you know I ain't strong enough
To keep myself from fallin'
Don't call me
Don't call me
You know I'm gonna pick up the phone
We'll pick up were we left off
Don't call me
Don't call me

Don't call me
Cause we been here before
Don't want me
If you don't want something more
Don't need me when you're lonely at 3 AM
Asking me to come over again, so I can hold you
Already told you, can't do that anymore
If you're gonna go, then go
Don't let my phone light up
I know you know I ain't strong enough
To keep myself from fallin'
Don't call me
Don't call me
