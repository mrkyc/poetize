Good, good girl, you look good on me
Good, good girl, you look good on me

Nobody's ever stared when I walk in a room
But now they are, it ain't because of me it's 'cause of you
You got me driving slow, girl when you're riding shotty
You got my Silverado looking like a Maserati

Ain't no doubt, when we're together
Girl, I ain't ever looked better

Neon light looks good on Jack
Looks good on ice
Looks good on lips on a Saturday night
Girl, just like blue looks good on jeans
Looks good on you
You look good on me
Good, good girl, you look good on me
Good, good girl, you look good on me

These days I got some style at least that's what they say
But I can't take the credit girl, you know I dress the same
You might also like
Ain't no doubt when we're together
Girl, I ain't ever looked better

Neon light looks good on Jack
Looks good on ice
Looks good on lips on a Saturday night
Girl, just like blue looks good on jeans
Looks good on you
You look good on me
Good, good girl, you look good on me
Good, good girl, you look good on me

You got me feeling like I'm cooler than cool
Talking smoother than James Dean hanging with you baby
Yeah girl you took me from the back of the line and
Made me all time V.I.P
Just like blue looks good on jeans
Looks good on you
You look good on me

Neon light looks good on Jack
Looks good on ice
Looks good on lips on a Saturday night
Girl, just like blue looks good on jeans
Looks good on you
You look good on me
Good, good girl, you look good on me
Good, good girl, you look good on me
Good, good girl, you look good on me
