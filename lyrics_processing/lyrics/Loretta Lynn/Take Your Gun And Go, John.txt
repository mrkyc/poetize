Our country calls, then go
Don't fear for me nor the children, John
I'll care for them you know
Leave the corn upon the stalk
The fruit upon the tree
And all all little stores, dear John
Yes, leave them all to me
Take your guns then go, dear John
Yes, take your guns, then go
For Ruth can drive the ox, dear John
And I can use the hoe

The army's short of blankets, John
Then take this heavy pair;
I spun and wove them when a girl
And worked them with great care
A rose in every corner, John
And here's my name, you see
On the cold cold ground they'll warmer feel
Because they're made by me
You might also likeSo take your guns then go, dear John
Yes, take your guns, then go
For Ruth can drive the ox, dear John
And I can use the hoe

And John, if God has willed it so
We never shall meet again
I'll do the best for the children, John
In sorrow, want or pain
On winter nights I'll teach them, John
All that I've learned at school
To love our country, keep our laws
Obey the Savior's rule
So take your guns then go, dear John
Yes, take your guns, then go
For Ruth can drive the ox, dear John
And I can use the hoe
And now goodbye to you, dear John
I cannot say farewell
We'll hope and pray for the best, dear John
His goodness none can tell
May his arms be around you, John
To guard you night and day
Be our beloved country's shield
Till war shall pass away
So take your guns then go, dear John
Take your guns, then go
For Ruth can drive the ox, dear John
And I can use the hoe
