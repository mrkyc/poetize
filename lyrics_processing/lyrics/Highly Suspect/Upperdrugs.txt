When I go out, I start searchin' for the upper drugs
When I wake up, I get scared without my downer drugs
Fuck

It's last call (Last call)
And now I gotta pay for all my shit and then go
Even though I'm wide awake
So let's go (Let's go)
Yeah, I can put you against the wall
I might as well make another mistake

It's not enough
I want to sleep forever
But I keep wakin' up
But all I feel is the pressure

When you speak (When you speak)
I choke 'cause you're remindin' me I'd rather be alone
I wish you would just disappear (Yeah)
You should know (You should know)
That these chemicals are taking full control
I use them 'cause I'm sick of being here

It's not enough
I want to sleep forever
But I keep wakin' up
I am under too much pressure
And it all keeps addin' up
And all we are is terror
I've had enough
I wanna sleep forever

When we come down, let's take it easy
When we come down, let's take it easy
When we come down, let's take it easy
(No) No, (Never) never
Never comin' down (Never comin' down)
(No) No, (Never) never
Never comin' down (Never comin' down)

Never comin' down
I'm never gonna come down

And it's not enough
I want to sleep forever
But I keep wakin' up
I'm under too much pressure
And it all keeps addin' up
And all we are is terror
I think I've had enough
I wanna sleep forever and ever
These chemicals are takin' control
I wish I could let them go
These chemicals are takin' control
I wish I could let it all go
These chemicals are takin' control
I wish I could let it all go
