My heart is pounding
And I don't want to be in my skin
Everybody
Everybody's trying to get in
Again

I feel like I'm ready to blow
When you're up against the world, it shows
Baby, I know

Hey, Mister Asylum
Won't you let me in?
Oh, Mister Asylum
I'm dying to get in
To get in

The truth is that I can't breathe
And I can't feel and I can't move
But I can see, yeah
So where am I now?
Is this hell? I can't tell
It's getting hotter
And I'm starting to think maybe that
There is no God

Well, I'm out here
Drowning and surrounded
By an ocean of emotion
And this can't be real
'Cause this feeling I'm feeling
Got me reeling
I'm dying again, so
Where did she go?
Oh, she left me such a long time
Such a long time ago, yeah
And I'm losing my shit
Baby, I'm broken

I need her now
More than ever before
'Cause I've started a battle
That's turned into a war
I won't swallow your pills
Yeah, I'll spit 'em back out
She's my resuscitation
My love in her mouth

So where do we go?
