Tears on a six string
Another angel gone, leavin' you all alone
Dealin' with your demons
I know you layin' there wonderin'
If your prayers ever make it through the ceilin' too
Yeah, I know what you're goin' through

If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes? Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healing

And there's a lot of soul lookin' for the high road
Everybody's needin'
Maybe just a little simple melody
Is all we need to keep our broken hearts beatin' true
And get the whole world in tune
You might also like
If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes? Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'

Yeah, I know in my heart of hearts
That we're where we're supposed to be
And everybody's got the scars
But we can live in harmony, yeah
(Your song is playin', it's gonna save us)
When you're layin' there wonderin'
If your prayers ever make it through the ceilin' too
Yeah, I know what you're goin' through

If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes? Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'
You gotta believe it
