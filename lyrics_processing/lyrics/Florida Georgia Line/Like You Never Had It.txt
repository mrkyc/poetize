I, I been waitin' all day for the sun to go down
Get away from the noise and the crowd
Girl, I been dying to get my hands on you
Run my fingers down your back
If that's where you like it at
Get it started just like that

I'll love you like you never had it
I'll get you makin' this a habit
I'll have you calling your friends, saying you ain't ever been
Skin on skin with a man like this
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)

You, you been wondering where I've been your whole life
Need somebody that'll fit just right
Treat your body, blow your mind
You might also like
I'll love you like you never had it
I'll get you makin' this a habit
I'll have you calling your friends, saying you ain't ever been
Skin on skin with a man like this
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)

Lock that door, close those curtains tight
We're going on and on, and on and on all night

I'll love you like you never had it
I'll get you makin' this a habit
I'll have you calling your friends, saying you ain't ever been
Skin on skin with a man like this
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
