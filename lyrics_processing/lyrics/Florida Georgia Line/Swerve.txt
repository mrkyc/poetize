It ain't the proof or the alcohol, nah
It's got my back up against the wall
Staring at you, you, you
Watching you move, move, move, yeah

And I can't even walk across the room without losing my cool
You got my world tippin' and spinnin' doin' what you do
Yeah, you're making me swerve

Hey girl, what's your name?
You must get it from your mama
Does your daddy let you date with all them curves? Hold on
Yeah, where you learn to dance?
Yeah, I'ma two-step up to you with that booty in them pants
Way you rollin' in that body, feel like I'm in a Bugatti
And I know I'm 'bout to lose control

You're making me swerve
(Making me, making me swerve
Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve)
You're making me swerve
(Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve
Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve)

You got me silly, girl, you got me high
'Cause you so fine, fine, fine
I'm losing my mind, mind, mind, yeah

And I can't even walk across the room without losing my cool
And girl you change the game, you got me changing lanes to hang with you
Yeah, you're making me swerve
