What'd he do this time?
Did he break your heart?
I can tell you've been crying, and baby, here you are
And I always know any time you show up at my door past eleven o'clock, that he really must've pissed you off

Take it out on me
And put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder any time it all goes down
When you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell
You can always take it out on me
You can take it out on me, baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, well, that's alright
You can take, take

Take off your coat
Baby, come on in
Well, girl, let me help to get back at him
And I don't know why you never say goodbye
Whatever hell he's puttin' you through
I can't wait for you to
You might also like
Take it out on me
Put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes down
When you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell
You can always take it out on me

Yeah, I'll lay you down and love you just the way you should be
Baby, so now that you're ready
Take it out on me
You can take it out on me, baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, that's alright
You can take, take

Take it out on me
And put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder any time it all goes down
When you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell
You can always take it out on me
You can take it out on me, baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, well, that's alright
