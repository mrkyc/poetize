Yeah, I grew up ten minutes from the sticks, ten minutes from the beach
And there ain't a Bible verse, y'all, I ain't heard a preacher preach
Mom and dad up in the bleachers, screaming while I pitch
Beating deep on the speakers, finally riding around the town

With my best friends, ain't life like a whirlwind?
One second I'm playing checkers with Grandma, then my world ends
I used to hear my granddaddy say, before it's too late

You gotta dig your roots 'fore the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go and get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots

You dig, you love, you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone

Yeah, I'm a long haired, tattooed, feather in the wind
Yeah, a good ol' boy, just like my old man
Every night when I'm singing, I know he's looking down
Up there next to PawPaw, got the best seats in the house

When I close my eyes I can still hear him say
The same thing I'm gonna tell my kids

You gotta dig your roots 'fore the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go and get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots

I'm so of proud of where I came from (It's every part of me)
This town is who I am (My name's on every street)
And the way that I was raised up (Yeah, you best believe)
Made me a better man (Just like my daddy)
I'm proud of where I came from (It's every part of me)
And damn I love this land (My name's on every street)
And the way that I was raised up (Yeah, you best believe)
Made me a better man

You gotta dig your roots 'fore the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go and get a little more dirt on my boots
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go and get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots
You dig, you love, you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone
