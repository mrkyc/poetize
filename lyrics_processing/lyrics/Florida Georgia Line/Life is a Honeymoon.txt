Every time I look in your eyes
It's like you take me back to the islands
You got me mile high cause you're my little pilot
I'm smiling, no sand in the hour glass
We can let the hours pass, baby, cause you're timeless
It's easy living right beside you
We got it, whatever we go through, baby

Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, we're gonna kick it
Get it sounding like Hendrix in here
Serve the cerveza cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear

See, it's a Monday through Friday, 365 celebration
A every day-cation
Let my kiss be an open invitation
See where it can take us and get our hearts racing
I love flying way up there with you
You keep the air up in my parachute, baby
You might also like
Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, let's have a party
Get it sounding like Marley in here
Serve the cerveza cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear

She is my morning sun and when the evening come
She's the moonlit sky, yeah
Truth is, this is how we belong
Happy people do it one and one, let your tear be gone
No need to worry, this love is forever young
The queen of my desire, you're my music from my song
The wood in on my fire, you're my fire that's never gone
Who feels it knows, FGL how it goes

Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, we're gonna kick it
Get it sounding like Hendrix in here
Serve the cerveza cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
