That sunset's straight up as it gets
Short shorts restin' just right on your hips
Kiss chillin' on your lips
I'm for sure gonna get it in a minute
First time I take another sip
That Chevrolet sittin' in the driveway
Is gonna stay sittin', girl, we ain't gettin' anywhere, but closer
I know you're in the mood with literally nothing but each other on the to-do list

We got all damn day to do it our way
Like an old tire swing in the shade
Got it made in the sweet spot
Baby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride
Don't matter if we're sittin' on the porch, in the car, at a bar
Or a boat down in Panama City
Gonna be a hell of a view
I'm just fine long as I'm sittin' next to you sittin' pretty, yeah
I'm sittin' pretty good
I'm sittin' pretty

Everything is feeling like it should
Don't think that it could, get any better
But this weather I wish it would
Turn up the heat, couple degrees
Get you in that AC, let down them blinds
Call it a day

I'm just fine long as I'm sittin' next to you sittin' pretty, yeah
I'm sittin' pretty, good
I'm sittin' pretty, damn
I'm sittin' pretty, good

Pretty as a peach
As a postcard picture of a West Coast beach
So pretty, if I had to bet
This is pretty much as good as it gets
