I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith

But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(Girl, you gotta know I love you)

My heart's on my sleeve, but it's turning black
(I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone)
Without your touch, I'm not gonna last
(I know you know that I need you just to carry on)
It feels like my walls are caving in
(You always wanted it more, I left you hangin' on)
And I'll do anything to have you here again
You might also like
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)

Yeah, the days are cold, the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you, and make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
'Cause goin' on without you is killing me everyday

And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(Girl, you gotta know I love you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
