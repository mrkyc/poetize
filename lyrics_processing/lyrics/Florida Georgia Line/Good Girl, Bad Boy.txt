She's a little red wine, he's a little bit whiskey smoke
He's a ragged on the edge, she's keeping him holding out hope
She's a front pew hallelujah, drop another 20 in the plate
He's on the back row a little hung over, bout 20 minutes late

She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

Well she's sundress cotton, he's grease on a Carhartt shirt
And she's a candle in the wind, he's a light it up and let it burn
And every time she's with him, all she wants to do is kiss him
Starts thinking maybe she can fix him
He's thinkin' he'd love to let her try

She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
You might also like
And every time she's with him
She knows she prolly oughta quit him
But he don't wanna let her get away

She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

Yeah
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
