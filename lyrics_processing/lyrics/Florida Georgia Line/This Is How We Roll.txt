The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little somethin' bumpin', thumb thumpin' on the wheel right
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
Trucks jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at

This is how we roll
We hangin' 'round, singin' out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll, this is how we do
We burnin' down the night, shootin' bullets at the moon
Baby, this is how we roll

Yeah, baby, this is how we roll, we rollin' into town
With nothin' else to do, we take another lap around
Yeah, holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted, hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat, oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live, it might not be for you, but it's for me though, let's roll

This is how we roll
We hangin' 'round, singin' out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll, this is how we do
When the world turns ugly, I just turn and look at you
Baby, this is how we roll


And we gon' sing it to 'em
Yeah, we're proud to be young, we stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah, we cuss on them Mondays and pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream about one day

'Cause this is how we roll (Come on, y'all)
We hangin' 'round, singin' out everything on the radio
(Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up)
We light it up with our hands up (Aw, yeah)
This is how we roll, this is how we ride
We slangin' up the mud, cuttin' through the country side
Baby, this is how we roll
Yeah, this is how we roll (This is how we roll)
Yeah, baby (How we roll)
Yo, LB, let's go (Yeah, this is how we roll)
This how we roll, this is how we do
We burnin' down the night, shootin' bullets at the moon (Aw, yeah)
Baby, this is how we roll (BK, Tyler)
LB, baby, one more time boys, let's go
