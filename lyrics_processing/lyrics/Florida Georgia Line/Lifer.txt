I'ma lifer

I can hear that rain fallin' on this tin roof
Girl after all we've been through
Feels like the calm after the storm
So what you say we take this sunday
Let me love you till it's monday
We'll go have a fun day and baby we'll get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the who's to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
I'm your man and you my lady

Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer

Whatever we go through girl we're family
There's nothin' we can't do can we
Tether through the weather, got us better than before
We just gotta learn how to stay here
Build on the love we made here
Make more time for prayer and the man upstairs
Cause I believe we can move any mountain when we're good
I believe I ain't me without you walkin' out in that white dress
Life without you is lifeless
And I'm your man and you my lady

Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer

The twists and turns
Sometimes the love can hurt ya
Sometimes it burns
The wait ain't always perfect
We'll just keep diggin'
Dig our feet into the dirt and we'll get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the who's to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
Can't wait to see our kids
Hope they look just like you

Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer
There's somethin' about them raindrops, them raindrops
Just let 'em fall
Till the pain stops, till the pain stops, let 'em fall
Just let 'em fall
There's somethin' about them raindrops, them raindrops
Just let 'em fall
Till the pain stops, till the pain stops, let 'em fall
