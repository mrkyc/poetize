The minute I met you
I said "Give me some time"
I'll have you laughin' and fallin' in love
'Til you tell the whole world that you're mine
I know it don't make sense
That a girl like you
With all of your beautiful, all of your wonder
Would ever end up with a hard-headed fool

Girl, I told you
That I'd love you forever
And I'll hold you in my arms and I'll never let go
I'll be standing there, girl, when you need me
Every morning you'll wake up and see
I do what I say and I say what I mean
One day we'll look back and girl, I won't say that I told you, yeah

I said our shadow
Would look good on my wall
I said your clothes would look better girl
If they were scattered all up and down my hall
And it took a lot of tryin' (A whole lot of tryin')
To steal away your heart
But I told you girl, I won't ever give up
If I got to, I'll steal you the stars
You might also like
Girl, I told you
That I'd love you forever
And I'll hold you in my arms and I'll never let go
I'll be standing there, girl, when you need me
Every morning you'll wake up and see
I do what I say and I say what I mean
One day we'll look back and girl, I won't say that I told you, yeah

I think you know when we get to heaven
Walkin' down streets of gold
We'll still be singin' and dancin' and lovin'
It's gon' be your hand that I hold

Girl, I told you (Yeah girl, I told you)
That I'd love you forever
And I'll hold you (Yeah girl, I'll hold you)
In my arms and I'll never let go (Never let go)
I'll be standing there, girl, when you need me (Right when you need me)
Every morning you'll wake up and see (Wake up and see)
I do what I say and I say what I mean
One day we'll look back and girl, I won't say that I told you (Oh)
Yeah girl, I told you (Yeah girl, I told you)
Girl, I told you
