Well there's those boys, got the kind of ride
Get fifty-five to the gallon
They listen to that new school
Never heard of George or Alan
There's those boys, wear the kind of boots
Who you ain't supposed to get muddy
Ain't got a dog that lives outside
Ain't got a buddy named Buddy

Yeah, I ain't hatin' on them boys
Grew up lockin' their doors
There's all kinds of boys up under the sun, son
But this one's for

Y'all boys with that southern drawl boys
Hell before you naw, rollin' off just right
Man, that town is small boys
But you'd have a ball boys
Homemade alcohol on a Saturday night
Yeah, truck stuck, who you gon' call?
Pretty girl, who you gon' fall for?
One of them backroad runners
Man, I'm glad I'm one of y'all boys
(Yo Hardy, go on tell 'em 'bout the girls one time)
You might also like
'Cause there's those girls, they're like golden pearls
Dipping into trust fund money (Cha-ching!)
Yeah, the radio and the Jack and Coke
Is the only thing they know country
Didn't grow up on no county road
They grew up on some street
And they think they know what kind of man
They want until they meet

Y'all boys with that southern drawl boys
Hell before you naw, rollin' off just right
Man, that town is small boys
But you'd have a ball boys
Homemade alcohol on a Saturday night
Yeah, truck stuck, who you gon' call?
Pretty girl, who you gon' fall for?
One of them backroad runners
Man, I'm glad I'm one of y'all boys

State trophy in the hall boys
Hangin' somethin' that you hunted on the wall boys
You mess with one of us, you get us all boys
Y'all boys with that southern drawl boys
Hell before you naw, rollin' off just right
Man, that town is small boys
But you'd have a ball boys
Homemade alcohol on a Saturday night
Yeah, truck stuck, who you gon' call?
Pretty girl, who you gon' fall for?
