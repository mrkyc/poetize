I wake up and get me
A gas station biscuit
Head to town, wash it down with some Mountain Dew
I end every day about the same way
Clock out and go fish just to crack a few
Chicken in a bread pan
Pickin' out gulls and cull with some ten pound tail
It might be hillbilly to a lot of folks
But Lord knows I couldn't care less

You can say I'm a redneck
You can say you don't like my truck
You can say that I talk and I dress all funny
But you, you can't say I ain't country
You can say I drink too many longnecks
And my edges are a little too rough
You can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday
But you, you can't say I ain't country

A pond water pool, a spinner on a spool
A styrofoam full of tobacco spit
I got a small town crew, we make our own rules
I do what I do 'cause my daddy did
You might also like
You can say I'm a redneck
You can say you don't like my truck
You can say that I talk and I dress all funny
But you, you can't say I ain't country
You can say I drink too many longnecks
And my edges are a little too rough
You can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday
But you, you can't say I ain't country

You can say that the world's flat
You can say we never made it to the moon
You can say we all come from a bunch of monkeys
But you, you can't say I ain't country, no

You can say I'm a redneck
You can say you don't like my truck
You can say that I talk and I dress all funny
But you, you can't say I ain't country
You can say I drink too many longnecks
And my edges are a little too rough
You can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday
But you, you can't say I ain't country
You can say what I'm smokin' on is kinda funky
But you, you can't say I ain't
You can't say I ain't country (No you can't)
Oh no, you can't say I ain't country
