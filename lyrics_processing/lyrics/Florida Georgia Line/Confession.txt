Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Driftin' like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cuttin' cross the sky
I'm rollin' through the open wide
Searchin' for a song to drink a beer to
And tryin' to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield lookin' back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here tryin' to get 'em untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waitin' on a call from an angel
You might also like
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield lookin' back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession


I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Hope he's movin' in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
