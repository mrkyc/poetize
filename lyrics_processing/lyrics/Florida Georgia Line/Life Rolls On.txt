People come, people go
Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't
Either way the wind blows
You gotta love it
Ain't gotta do it by yourself
Don't be afraid to ask for help
Even when it hurts like hell, gotta love it
Oh yeah

As long as my heart's beatin'
And these old lungs keep breathin'
The highs and the lows, yes and the no's
Only gonna make you strong
Yeah, bruh
This world will keep turnin'
The bonfires will keep burnin'
And I don't know what God's thinkin' of
But where we are is where we belong
Oh, and I know it might be alright
Might be all wrong
But life rolls on
And on and on and on

Drivin' past my old house
A wreckin' ball took it down
But I still got them memories, gotta love it
Yes, I do (Oh)
You might also like
As long as my heart's beatin'
And these old lungs keep breathin'
The highs and the lows, yes and the no's
Only gonna make you strong
Yeah, bruh
This world will keep turnin'
The bonfires will keep burnin'
And I don't know what God's thinkin' of
But where we are is where we belong
Oh, and I know it might be alright
Might be all wrong
But life rolls on
And on and on and on (Yeah)

I won't give up on you
Please don't give up on me
Things gonna turn out just fine
Someday all the pain
Will be gone
Life rolls (Yeah, baby)

As long as my heart's beatin' (Beatin')
And these old lungs keep breathin' (Breathin')
The highs and the lows, yes and the no's
Only gonna make you strong
Oh, and I know it might be alright
Might be all wrong
But life rolls on
And on and on and on
Life rolls on
And on and on and on
