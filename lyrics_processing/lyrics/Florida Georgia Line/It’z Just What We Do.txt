Don't act like y'all didn't know this wasn't comin'
Alright

You know Tommy gonna trick his truck, jack it up big time
Lift kit, chrome tips, spit shinin' like a diamond
Game change when the rain came and we took it down a back road
Georgia clay mud hole, that's how these boys roll
Now it's late night underneath the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' right and sippin' on a Bud Light
Go on, drop your tailgate, turn up your radio
I'ma build a bonfire, you can make yourself at home

Kick back, relax, you know we just a bunch of hillbillies
Tip back your cup of Jack and throw your hands up with me

Hey, we might look a little crazy tonight
But hey baby, that's alright
It's our backwoods boondock roots
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Hey, ain't no way to make this up
When it's runnin' through your blood
There ain't no hidin' the truth
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Yeah, it's just a what we do
You might also like
You see, Tommy called Jenny and Jenny gon' call the hotties
Tell 'em 'bout the party, so don't forget the Bacardi
Time to get your buzz on, and your love on all night long
And if you play your hand right, you won't have to go home alone
Six-string pickin', solo cup sippin'
And when the moments right, grab your phone and get them digits
Crankin' that Bocephus, we all good with Jesus
Come Sunday mornin', that preacher, he 'bout to preach it
Kick back, relax, and pass the good time moonshine
Who brought the party? Damn, that was Florida Georgia Line

Hey, we might look a little crazy tonight
But hey baby, that's alright
It's our backwoods boondock roots
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Hey, ain't no way to make this up
When it's runnin' through your blood
There ain't no hidin' the truth
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Yeah, it's just a what we do


Hey (Come on, baby), we might look a little crazy tonight
But hey baby, that's alright
It's our backwoods boondocks roots
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Hey, ain't no way to make this up
When it's runnin' through your blood
There ain't no hidin' the truth
(It's just what we do)
Hey, what you say we get crazy tonight? (Crazy tonight)
Go get your drinks up high
It's our backwoods boondocks roots
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Hey, ain't no way to make this up (Make this up)
When it's runnin' through your blood
There ain't no hidin' the truth
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Yeah, it's just what we do
