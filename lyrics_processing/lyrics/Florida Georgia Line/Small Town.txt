If you leave your doors unlocked
If your garage is your body shop
If your dog's got room to run
You might be from a small town
And if you've ever kissed a girl
Spinnin' 'round on a tilt-a-whirl
At the county fair in the summer sun
You might be from a small town

I bet you been sittin' on a John Deere tractor
Bet you been fishin' with an old cane pole
Been cow-tippin' in a big green pasture
Burned up a clutch on a red dirt road
Homegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco
Shiner Friday night, the sun settin' real slow
In the parking lot with the party crowd
Little bit of love in the truck way out
If you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down
You might be from a small town
You might be from a small town

If you got a spot or two
Where you kick it with your high school crew
Or you drive 30 miles for a fifth of rum
You might be from a small town, yeah

Been cow-tippin' in a big green pasture
Burned up a clutch on a red dirt road
Homegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco

In the parking lot with the party crowd
Little bit of love in the truck way out
If you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down
You might be from a small town

Yeah, put the fence in the dirt, no rent paid (No rent)
What you know about church on a Wednesday? (Uh)
What you know about workin' the ten day straight
On a turn road, tryna get the bills paid?
Ever raced your truck? Ever wrecked one?
Said grace in a Mexican restaurant? (Amen)
Painted "I love you" in bright red
On a water tower, I bet

I bet you been sittin' on a John Deere tractor
Bet you been fishin' with an old cane pole
Been cow-tippin' in a big green pasture
Burned up a clutch on a red dirt road
Homegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco
