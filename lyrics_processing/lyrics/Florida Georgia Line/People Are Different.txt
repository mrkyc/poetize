White collar, blue collar, hillbilly, high dollar
Hot head, pot head, non-believer, holy water
Big city, small town, y'all take a look around
People are different
Heavy metal, hip hop, steel toe, flip flops
Sip it slow, cold beer, hits you fast, whiskey shot
Accent North, South, good as gold, sailor mouth
People are different

Yeah, we all know it's true
But it don't mean that me and you

Can't walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
People are different
You might also like
Left wing, right wing, jail house, freedom ring
Old school, new school, everything in-between
Like a snowflake, no fingerprint's the same
And people are different

I wish that it was something that we all understood
Lord knows it'd do us all some good

To walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
Yeah, people are different

You can turn on the TV
Change the channel if you don't like what you see
You can get your money back if it ain't your size
You can throw it in the trash if you don't like it
But listen, people are different
So walk down the street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
People are different
People are different
