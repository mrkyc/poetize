In your cup holder was some loose change
Ya got your cellphone on vibrate
I wish you were on it
There's a road you got to take to get to my place
Faded double yellow lines on a two lane
I wish you were on it

I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it
(Wish you were on it, wish you were on it)

There's a parking spot under the sycamore
And the flood light on the front porch
I wish you were on it
And through the front door, up the stair case
There's a four post down the hall way
I wish you were on it
You might also like
I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it
(Wish you were on it, wish you were on it)

There's a heart that needs to unbreak
And you know the way

I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it
