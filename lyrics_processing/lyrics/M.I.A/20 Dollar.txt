War! War! War!
Talking about you's such a bore
I'd rather talk about moi
Like do you know the cost of AK's up in Africa?
20 dollars ain't shit to you
But that's how much they are
So they're gonna use the shit just to get far
Is gold diamonds helping ya?
Don't you like my ban-dan-na? (bandana)
My stains hang low, on my shirt's like "Ay-ya-ya!"
Got monkey brains and banana
I'll hit you with my antenna
I put soap in my eye
Make it red so I look rawr-rawr-rawr!
So I woke up with my Holy Quran
And found out I like Cadillac
So we're shootin' until the sun is up
Little boys are acting up
And baby mothers are going crazy
And the leaders all around cracking up
We goat-rich, we fry
Price of livin' in a shanty town just seems very high
But we still like T.I
But we still look fly
Dancin' as we're shootin' up
And lootin' just to get by (Huh?)
See M.I.A. LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like
With your feet on the air
Your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it - yeah!
Your head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Huh?)

War! War! War!
Who made me like this!
Was it me and God in co-production?
My Devil's on speed-dial
Every time I take the wrong direction
All I want is one thing and that is what you got
Sometimes I go and lose my mind, then I feel numb
There's 24 hours in a day
I used to spilt it 8, 8, 8
8 - work! 8 - sleep!
And 8 for play!
Now I give it all it takes
Now people on the Internet
A new life for the intellect
People judge me so hard cause I don't floss my titties out
I was born out of dirt like I'm porn in a skirt
I was a little girl who made good, well au revoir, adieu
I put people on the map that never seen a map
I've showed 'em something they've never seen
And hope they make it back!
With your feet on the air
Your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it - yeah!
Your head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Huh?)
With your feet on the air
Your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it - yeah!
Your head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it
