Time after time, you been copping mine
Like, "Can I have a good time at yours tonight?"
Cause every time we try to get close
There is always something that I'm thinking about

(You want me) XXXO, XXXO
(You want me) XXXO, XXXO
(You want me) XXXO, XXXO
(You want me) XXXO
(You want me) XXXO

You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not

A knock at the door, and then we hit the floor
And all I know is you leave me wanting more
I don't let it show, but I think you know
Cause you tweeting me like Tweety Bird on your iPhone

(You want me) XXXO, XXXO
(You want me) XXXO, XXXO
(You want me) XXXO, XXXO
(You want me) XXXO
(You want me) XXXO
