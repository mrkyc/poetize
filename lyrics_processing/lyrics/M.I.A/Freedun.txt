I'm M.I.A., ayy

I don't need any audition
I just got my own little mission
It grew bigger than a politician
Yeah, history is just a competition
Do you wanna sign my petition?
It's for the people with dedication
Some people fuck it up, take vacations
Refugees learn about patience
Sometimes I have many visions
I don't even need a religion
I'm a new frontier, horizons
Yeah, I sail this ship to the thousands
Even aliens see the presentation
Yeah, tune up the dial on the station
And think of me sort of like Tarzan
And I'm swingin' this beat, salvation

I can feel when your heart beats, yeah

If you don't catch it, then, baby, I'm gone
Send me your money and I'll send you my song
What you get is perfect, it took me lifelong
Lara Croft is soft when it comes to my stuff
She's made up, I'm real, that's enough
Dinosaurs died out and I'm still strong
A little bit of fun, yeah, I don't see it wrong
For something so good, yeah, I've waited too long
I rate that button just to play you this song
Whose world is this? The world is mine, so bring it on

All the stars are still shining
But you're the only one I see
I can feel when your heart beats, yeah
Babe, you can't keep your eyes off me
