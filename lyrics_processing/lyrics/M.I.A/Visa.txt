They call me Arular, trendsetter, makin' life real better
Breaking order like a leader now folla
Proppin' poppin' a collar, yea hustle a dollar
You can't touch us like MC Hammer
With my mum's string hoppers, jump in the chopper
Yea, chop up a mango with salt and pepper
Holla, holla, holla, true scholar with a honour
And I'm here to shine the light on the matter

At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola!"
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y.A.L.A.!"

Bola a bola got a friend called Booma
And he looks like Obama when we burner
Turtleneck and bomber
It's a Bamboo Banga
And you know I'm comin' back with power
Yea '64 Impala, Hummer or Toyota
When I drive in I'm a winner
Whatever I'mma rap got fuel in the burner
Off the grid, staying off the radar
See M.I.A. LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola!"
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y.A.L.A.!"

Yeah shudda a shudda, yeah shoot a computer
Pour yourself a shot of tequila
Time for a banger, throw up your middle finger
I'm a writer competition we gon' murder
I'm a fighter and a lover like winter and summer
I ain't really looking for no drama

At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola!"
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y.A.L.A.!"

Most of the things I do, they banned it
But I'ma still do it, I'm a bandit
I'ma still, I'ma still, I'ma still, I'ma still
But I'ma still do it, I'm a bandit
Most of the things I do, they banned it
But I'ma still do it, I'm a bandit
I'ma still, I'ma still, I'ma still, I'ma still
But I'ma still do it, I'm a bandit
Bandit bandit, ba-bandit
