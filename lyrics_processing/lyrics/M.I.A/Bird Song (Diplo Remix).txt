I'm a parrot
I'm robin this joint
Not a lyre bird
Sure ain't a vulture
Don't swallow that cause I make the culture
I'm not a lyre bird, I'm not a lyre bird
Staying, staying rich like an ostrich
Love ain't a albatross hanging 'round ya neck
Drink a sparrow, love is food, take a peck
Let's go to Turkey, swift like a rail
Can't pigeon hole, I'm epic like a Zeus tail

Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love

Doves cry
Are you going home alone?
Squad flock
Migrate for the summer
Duck out for, for some hot weather
Birds of prey and I'm shaking off my feather
See the water foul, swing on a creeper
Like starlin dictating love on my speaker
Hot flamingo, go bird emoji yo
Monogamous like a swan going with the flow

Watch the sky, watch the sky
Watching, watching the sky

Is that a crow on a crain?
Is that you or a plane?
Where's your chicken at?
I'm watching like a hawk
Aye, I need more birds!
Gully like a seagull
Gully like a, gully like a seagull
Gully like a seagull
I'm cuckoo for you, let's talk!
Free up my love

Drop down get your eagle on
Drop down, drop down like a falcon
Drop down get your eagle on
Drop down, drop down get your eagle on
Drop down get your eagle on
Drop down, drop down like a falcon
Drop down, fly phenomenon
Humming higher than a drone
