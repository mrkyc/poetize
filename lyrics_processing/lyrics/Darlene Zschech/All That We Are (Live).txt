You took up Your cross, gave it all for us
So that we might know grace
You gave up Your crown, an act so profound
We'll never be the same
We will never be the same

All that we are for Your glory
All that we are for Your Name, Jesus
All that we are for Your glory
We praise You, we praise You

All that we are for Your glory
We praise You, we praise You
All that we are for Your glory

What a sacrifice
You laid down Your life
To save a sinner's heart like mine
I surrender all, all to You my God
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah to Your Name
All that we are for Your glory
All that we are for Your Name, Jesus
All that we are for Your glory
We praise You, we praise You
All that we are for Your glory
All that we are for Your Name, Jesus
All that we are for Your glory
We praise You, we praise You
