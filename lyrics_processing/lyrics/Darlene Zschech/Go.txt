Now we pray, all glory be to God
In Your Name, Your power at work in us
Feel the heavens shaking
Every chain is breaking

Now we pray, let darkness flood with light
In Your Name, Your resurrection life
We display Your glory
Miracles and mercy

We will go
Into all the world we go
Into all the world we go
Into all the world we go
With Your love
Into every life, Your love
So glorious, Your love
Into all the world we go

Now we pray and shout, Your love is here
In Your Name, we throw down every fear
Always in Your presence
Here on earth as heaven
You might also like
We will go
Into all the world we go
Into all the world we go
Into all the world we go
With Your love
Into every life, Your love
So glorious, Your love
Into all the world we go

Here we come, now Your church
We will go to all the world
Every tribe, every land
As Your feet and loving hands
To the rich, to the poor
Grace is flowing for us all
Nothing missing, nothing broken
He makes all things new
From the ash, from the fire
There is hope there is new life
Tell the world, lift Him high
Nothing else will satisfy
All the joy, all the peace
He has set us free indeed
Nothing missing, nothing broken
He makes all things new
We will go
Into all the world we go
Into all the world we go
Into all the world we go
With Your love
Into every life, Your love
So glorious, Your love
Into all the world we go
We will go
Into all the world we go
Into all the world we go
Into all the world we go
With Your love
Into every life, Your love
So glorious, Your love
Into all the world we go

Here we come, now Your church
We will go to all the world
Every tribe, every land
As Your feet and loving hands
To the rich, to the poor
Grace is flowing for us all
Nothing missing, nothing broken
He makes all things new
From the ash, from the fire
There is hope there is new life
Tell the world, lift Him high
Nothing else will satisfy
All the joy, all the peace
He has set us free indeed
Nothing missing, nothing broken
He makes all things new!
Nothing missing, nothing broken
He makes all things new!
Nothing missing, nothing broken
