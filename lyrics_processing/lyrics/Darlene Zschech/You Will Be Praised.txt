Though I walk through darkest valleys
There's no fear for You are with me
You have held me through the fire
Jesus, You are here with me
Even when my heart grows weary
You are my hiding place
And Your kindness draws me closer
I will rest here in Your strength

You will be praised, You will be praised
Through every storm, You will remain
In death and in life, I'll not be afraid
In joy or in pain, You will be praised

Here with You, my cup runs over
You are everything I need
There is nothing like Your presence
Still You are the song I sing
For You have been my portion
You are my hiding place
When this earthly fight is over
Only heaven's joy remains
You might also like
You will be praised, You will be praised
Through every storm, You will remain
In death and in life, I'll not be afraid
In joy or in pain, You will be praised

Oh my, soul will praise
In the darkest of nights
Oh my, soul will praise
Oh-oh-ohh
I will, bless Your Name
With all of my strength
I will, bless Your Name!
Oh my, soul will praise
In the darkest of nights
Oh my, soul will praise
Oh-oh-ohh
I will, bless Your Name
With all of my strength
I will, bless Your Name!

You will be praised, You will be praised
Through every storm, You will remain
In death and in life, I'll not be afraid
In joy or in pain, You will be praised
In joy or in pain, You will be praised

Oh my, soul will praise
In the darkest of nights
Oh my, soul will praise
Oh-oh-ohh
I will, bless Your Name
With all of my strength
I will, bless Your Name!
Oh my, soul will praise
In the darkest of nights
Oh my, soul will praise
Oh-oh-ohh
I will, bless Your Name
With all of my strength
