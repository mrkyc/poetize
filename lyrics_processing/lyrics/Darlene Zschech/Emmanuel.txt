There's no one like Jesus, there's no one like Jesus
Rescued me from darkness, filled my life with gladness
Carrying my burdens, peace in every battle
There's no one like Jesus, calm in every storm

Lord, You took my place with open arms, forgiveness overflows
I am covered by the grace of Calvary
Now You carry me through suffering, Your love will not let go
Oh God; no one like You
Jesus, no one like You

There's no one like Jesus, there's no one like Jesus
Strength in times of weakness, Word in flesh among us
You meet me in my sadness, walk with me through
There's no one like Jesus, calm in every storm

Lord, You took my place with open arms, forgiveness overflows
I am covered by the grace of Calvary
Now You carry me through suffering, Your love will not let go
Oh God; no one like You
Jesus, no one like You
You might also like
The heavens are open over me
Your glory is like the sun
And nothing can separate me from, Your love!
The heavens are open over me
Your glory is like the sun
And nothing can separate me from, Your love!

Lord, You took my place with open arms, forgiveness overflows
I am covered by the grace of Calvary
Now You carry me through suffering, Your love will not let go
Oh God; no one like You
Jesus, no one like You
