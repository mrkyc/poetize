Well in the early autumn wind
A lonely dove is flyin'
Mournin' for his one true love
He can't be blamed for cryin'
He can't be blamed for cryin'

Well the rooster, he got twenty gals
Well he's happy as a lark
Well he wake 'em in the mornin' time
Put 'em all to bed at dark
Put 'em all to bed at dark

Well if you've been true
Well if you've been true
You'd better look me in the eyes
'Cause all I smell is cheap perfume
And gin... and smoke... and lies

Well where were you last Saturday
All dressed up so pretty?
With your blue-eyed ballroom boy
In Oklahoma City
In Oklahoma City
See Turnpike Troubadours LiveGet tickets as low as $51You might also like
Well the spade is made for diggin' dirt
And an axe is made for choppin'
And darlin' my heart's hard as nails
They hammer in a hardwood coffin
In a hardwood coffin

Well if you've been true
Well if you've been true
You'd better look me in the eyes
'Cause all I smell is cheap perfume
And gin... and smoke... and lies

Well way down in the bottom land
A big black crow is laughin'
No one ever goes down there
Wonder what has happened
Wonder what has happened

And in the early autumn wind
A lonely dove is flyin'
Mournin' for his one true love
He can't be blamed for cryin'
He can't be blamed for cryin'
Well if you've been true
Well if you've been true
You'd better look me in the eyes
'Cause all I smell is cheap perfume
And gin... and smoke... and lies

Well if you've been true
Well if you've been true
You'd better look me in the eyes
'Cause all I smell is cheap perfume
And gin... and smoke... and lies
