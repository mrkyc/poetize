Well lookin' back when I met you
We were shinin', we were brand new
A couple kids who'd never been to town
It was a quart of beer, a paper sack
Leave a penny on the railroad track
You'd let me steal a kiss from you when no one was around

Hangin' out, hangin on
To the night 'fore it was gone
Like we'd never see that parking lot again
We were sneakin' in the picture show
And pourin' bourbon in our Coke
Aw and never seein' how the movie ends
And I thought that they might ride off in the sun

But you wrecked it all, you wrecked my heart
You wrecked our house and you wrecked my car
Left all the pieces scattered on the lawn
Caught up in your headlights
Well I was blindsided in plain sight
I'll salvage what I may when you're gone
But you wrecked it all
See Turnpike Troubadours LiveGet tickets as low as $51You might also like
Well on down the road we built our home
Out of bedsheets and Styrofoam
Hopin' that the wind might never blow
And it's love or fight everyday
Like a Tennessee Williams play
Not knowin' how it ended when we signed on for the show
And I hoped that we might ride off in the sun

But you wrecked it all, you wrecked my heart
You wrecked our house and you wrecked my car
Left all the pieces scattered on the lawn
Caught up in your headlights
Well I was blindsided in plain sight
I'll salvage what I may when you're gone
But you wrecked it all
You wrecked it all

Life ain't what it was back then
Someone smashed the windshield in
Well you never see it comin' 'til it's knockin' out your teeth
And it's the same Saturday
Brand new Fords and Chevrolets
Lined up like they never saw the likes of you and me
And I watched them as they drove off in the sun
But you wrecked it all, you wrecked my heart
You wrecked our house and you wrecked my car
Left all the pieces scattered on the lawn
Caught up in your headlights
Well I was blindsided in plain sight
I'll salvage what I may when you're gone
But you wrecked it all
