I guess what I'll miss the most will be the mornings
The squeak of a hardwood floor as you start out your day
And I've loved you darling from across your kitchen table
And I've loved you darling from a thousand miles away

Oh and I'm still standing here and I've got reasonable fears
All the houses I've built came crashing down around my ears

And we got a long drive home
We got a long drive home
We got a long drive home
And I'm damned if I do
And I'm damned if you don't

If home is what you're lookin for, won't you find another business?
If loving songs ain't in your cards, won't you find another game?
Well I'm still here searching for the things that I've been missing
Living with these lowdown fools and all our stupid shame

Oh and I still dwell and set on all the things that I regret
You still can't forgive the times that I wish I could forget

And we got a long drive home
We got a long drive home
We got a long drive home
And I'm damned if I do
And I'm damned if you don't

Well people anymore, they got no staying power
A love you come by easy, it'll leave you just the same
You want somethin bad, you gotta bleed a little for it
You gotta look it in the eye, you gotta call it out by name

Oh and lovers they march by, but they ain't like you and I
They all wanna be Hank Williams, they don't wanna have to die

And we got a long drive home
We got a long drive home
We got a long drive home
And I'm damned if I do
