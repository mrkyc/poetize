Lorrie lit a cigarette and smiled and waved
The smoke out of her face
With her black hair brown from the summer sun
Green eyes looked around the place
And she told me that she loved me
And I grinned and grabbed her hand and said, "I know"
Let's get from here, now darling
If we're going, let's go on and go

Well, Lorrie said her family used to have a little money
And they still act like they do
Well, your daddy don't think I'm fit to sit
In the same room with you
And if I ever set foot in Sevier county
Well your brother said he'd break my jaw
But here I stand with the dark haired daughter of Southwest Arkansas

And I've been learning that believing
And that barely breaking even
It's just a part of life for you and me
And I've been living with the loneliness
It's got down in my bones I guess
It's just another phase of being free
And I've been learning how to lose a thing I never laid a hand on
All along

Well De Queen's dry so I bought us both a bottle
In downtown Broken Bow
Lorries got a buddy with a double wide trailer
They were shaking dominos
And I had good intentions 'til I had too many
I was stupid, I suppose
You better put a little money where your mouth is, boy
And try to keep it closed

And I've been learning that believing
And that barely breaking even
It's just a part of life for you and me
And I've been living with the loneliness
It's got down in my bones I guess
It's just another phase of being free
And I've been learning how to lose a thing I never laid a hand on
All along
Well good Lord, Lorrie, I love you
Could it go more wrong?
Well good Lord, Lorrie, I love you
Could it go more wrong?

Well Lorrie said "I wonder what we ever went through
"All this trouble for
"You ain't half of who I thought you was
"And this ain't fun no more"
And her words cut clean through drunk and dark
And dimmin' doorway light
Well I've had all I can handle
Hope you're happy now, goodnight
Guess her folks were right
Guess her folks were right

Well good night, Lorrie, I love you
Could it go more wrong?
Well good night, Lorrie, I love you
