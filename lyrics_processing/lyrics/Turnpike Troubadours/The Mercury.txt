Lorrie laughs like she just don't care
Got a red bandana and raven hair
Sitting in the corner at The Mercury
Cowboy killers in a plain white tee
And back before the glasses and the sleeve tattoos
She's just another small town kid
Sure she's gotta couple problems now
But she doesn't try to keep 'em hid

Her kind of loving is a little like a fist fight
Alright, alright
The kind of thing you never see before midnight
Girl, I know you're gonna wreck this town
Won't tell me where to be when the walls start falling

Well I've never seen Jimmy in that old Corvette
He looks like hell but he ain't dead yet
Rough around the edges but his clothes are clean
Hayseed dressed up like James Dean
And any way I play it well I can't get him to say it
But I think that him and Lorrie were a thing
Well come now that I think about it
He don't say much of anything

Her kind of loving is a little like a fist fight
Alright, alright
The kind of thing you never see before midnight
Girl, I know you're gonna wreck this town
Won't tell me where to be when the walls start falling

Well, it's 1 AM and wild and loud
Like sittin' in the middle of a funnel cloud
A five-spot for a shot and a beer
Now do you wonder how we wound up here
I tell you friend that every now and then
It's like a money game of cut throat pool
Lorrie's talking just a little too sweet to me
Jimmy's in the next bar stool

Her kind of loving is a little like a fist fight
Alright, alright
The kind of thing you never see before midnight

Well it's throwback punks and daytime drunks
And PBR's and stouts
Lorrie's over by the jukebox now
Dancing to the "Twist and Shout"
And Jimmy's storming out the front door
Lord you'd think someone had died
I ain't going anywhere at all
Now I'm about to hit my stride
Her kind of loving is a little like a fist fight
Alright, alright
The kind of thing you never see before midnight
Girl I know you're gonna wreck this town
Won't you tell me where to be when the walls start falling
Girl I know you're gonna wreck this town
Won't you tell me where to be when the walls start falling
Girl I know you're gonna wreck this town
Won't you tell me where to be when the walls start falling
Girl I know you're gonna wreck this town
