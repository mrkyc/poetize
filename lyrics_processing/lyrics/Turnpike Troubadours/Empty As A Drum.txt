Well two old red-nosed whiskey drunks were talkin' politics
It was time to hit the bricks, it was time for me to go
And I was right there on the verge of pullin' out my hair
Actin as though I could not care less and hopin' she would show
When my bags were packed and ready, I was feelin' like a wreck
Some clothes and personal effects, I left everything I own
And the last I laid eyes on her, we were in a hotel hall
Holdin' hands like paper dolls, aw but here I sit alone

Well I'm gonna give it one more minute, give me one more round of rum
Well I'm as empty as a drum, I'm as empty as a drum
Could you spare a cigarette, I hate to be a bum
But here's to hopin' she'll still come, I'm too old to be this dumb Well I'm too old to be this dumb

Well I tell you that bartender, she's a sight to see
Aw you'd be envious of me, least you would if she was here
And the kid there in the corner has been spoilin' for a fight
And it feels like that kind of night, aw but instead pour me a beer

And I'm gonna give it one more minute, give me one more round of rum
Well I'm as empty as a drum, I'm as empty as a drum
Could you spare a cigarette, I hate to be a bum
But here's to hopin' she'll still come, I'm too old to be this dumb Well I'm too old to be this dumb

When you darkened up the doorway, I stood up from the bar
Well I said hey now here you are, damn it darlin', how are you?
And you kissed me
Said I can't say that I'm great oh Lord I hate it that I'm late
