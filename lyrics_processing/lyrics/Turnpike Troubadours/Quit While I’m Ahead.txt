Well I won't lie and say I didn't think the good ones all were taken
Since there ain't no peaches fallin' from the tree that I've been shakin'
And it's solitary sleepin' in this bed that I've been makin'
Well maybe I should quit while I'm ahead
Well my intent was being handed, I never laid a hand
And the kindness of my gestures were a good far cry from grand
They were awful well intended, they were all that I could stand
Ah maybe I should quit while I'm ahead

And now darlin' if I called you, could you love me like a kid
Could you love me like you loved me way back when you really did
Well darlin' if I called you could you just pick up the phone
Lord, I've been dancin' with damnation and I'm drinkin' all alone
And I am busted, broken, bent and beaten 'bout halfway to dead
Well maybe I should quit while I'm ahead, oh Lord
Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead

Well West Texas in the mornin', little darlin' are you down
Well the color of the country is your sweet-eyed shade of brown
And if I told you how I felt, well you'd say "boy get out of town"
Well maybe I should quit while I'm ahead

Now darlin if I called you, could you love me like a kid
Could you love me like you loved me way back when you really did?
Well darlin if I called you would you even talk to me
When I am lit up like a star atop your favorite Christmas tree
And I am busted, broken, bent and beaten 'bout halfway to dead
Ah maybe I should quit while I'm ahead, oh Lord
Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead
