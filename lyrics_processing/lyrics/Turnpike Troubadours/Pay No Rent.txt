I hear the clicking of the dominoes
You shaking up a game
And if we lose a hand
I bet I'll know just who's to blame
But if we hear "twenty-one"
If we make that call
I better sit here in my chair
Just feeling ten feet tall

And we're caught up in the riff-raff
Circling 'round the sun
It takes a whole lot of blood and tears
Just to really love someone
But when it comes back around
That's heaven on earth
You never know 'til the end, my friend
What your love is really worth

Are you cracking jokes with the common folks?
Are you serving to the well-to-do?
I've traveled 'round
And I ain't found nobody quite like you
And is all this living meant to be or a happy accident?
In my heart you pay no rent
Well in my heart you pay no rent

I hear the crackle of a campfire
You're howlin' at the moon
We all know that you gotta go
But does it have to be so soon?
Bet somebody' yelling last call
I hope you get some rest
Hope you found everything that you wanted
In the place you love the best

Are you cracking jokes with the common folks?
Are you serving to the well-to-do?
Well I've traveled 'round
And I ain't found nobody quite like you
And is all this living meant to be or a happy accident?
Well in my heart you pay no rent
Well in my heart you pay no rent


Now we're shaking up the dominoes
Beneath the neon light
Knowing anybody else out there
Couldn't put up a better fight
But the fighting time's over
Yeah it's all gone
You pick up the pieces
And we try to carry on
Are you cracking jokes with the common folks?
Are you serving to the well-to-do?
Well I've traveled 'round
And I ain't found nobody quite like you
And is all this living meant to be or a happy accident?
Well in my heart you pay no rent

Don't cost you nothing, not a single cent
Time together well was time well spent
In my heart you pay no rent
