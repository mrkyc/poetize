Ailanrutas si siht

When all your demons die
Even if just one survives
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold you are
I see the terror in your teardrop
Take your belief
Make it snow, let go
And wait together until we thaw

I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road
I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road

Just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
I was invited to eat the young
I was invited to eat the young
You might also like
A stunning possession of symbolic firearms
In the bottomless celebrity scar
A stunning possession of symbolic firearms
In the bottomless celebrity scar

I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road
I don't want to be another bullet hole
In the exit sign of your road

So, just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle, hot metal in the setting sun
And I was invited to eat the young
I was invited to eat the young

Si siht ailanrutas

By the roadside, all the bones picked clean
No gas in our machine
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold we are
Can't stop now, no flowers to smell
The Earth ate up the Son, can't even load my gun
It seems like Saturnalia

Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia

There's no exit plan here
No emergency room in this tomb
And this door only opens one way
There's no exit plan here
No emergency room in this tomb
And this door only opens one way

Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia

Blinded by blackness, we're just empty shells
In the deafening void of our last sunset
Blinded by blackness, just empty shells
