I write songs to fight and to fuck to
If you wanna fight, then I'll fight you
If you wanna fuck, I will fuck you
Make up your mind or I'll make it up for you

The present is too fast
Anticipation is killing us
Cutting up rails
Eating our own tales
So we're sucking up Snow White's powder
White powder, Snow White powder
High as a tower and ready to fall
To the street like a Viper
Like a Viper, like a Viper, like a Viper

I write songs to fight and to fuck to
If you wanna fight, then I'll fight you
If you wanna fuck, I will fuck you
Make up your mind or I'll make it up for you

Sucking Snow White powder
White powder, Snow White powder
High as a tower
Fall to the street like a Viper
Like a Viper, like a Viper, like a Viper

I write songs to fight and to fuck to
If you wanna fight, then I'll fight you
If you wanna fuck, I will fuck you
Make up your mind or I'll make it up for you
Make up your mind or I'll make it up for you

I'm like a Jesus Crisis, Jesus Crisis
And I made it up for you
I'm like a Jesus Crisis, Jesus Crisis
And I made it up for you, made it up for you
Jesus Crisis
Jesus Crisis
Jesus Crisis
Jesus Crisis
I'm the Jesus Crisis
And I made it up for you

I write songs to fight and to fuck to
If you wanna fight, then I'll fight you
If you wanna fuck, I will fuck you
Make up your mind or I'll make it up for you
I write songs to fight and to fuck to
If you wanna fight, then I'll fight you
If you wanna fuck, I will fuck you
Make up your mind or I'll make it up for you

(Fight! Fuck!) Make it up for you
(Fight! Fuck!) Make it up for you
(Fight! Fuck!) Make it up for you
