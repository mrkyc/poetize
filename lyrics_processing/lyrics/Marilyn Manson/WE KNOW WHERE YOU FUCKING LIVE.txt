Let's make something clear
We're all recording this as it happens
No diamond-bullet storefront-blood-bank
Splinters and stained glass
We don't need to move a single prayer bone
Dodge/burn so loud and sub-low
We don't need to move a single prayer bone
Hi-def is still life

"So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?"
"So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?"

We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse

The world was stripped
Of its superficial surfaces
We don't intend to just eat the street
The asphalt is the good meat
You might also likeAnd we will sleep on the skin of its nightmares
We will sleep on the skin of its nightmares
"It's time to just kill this crowd
And scream as fucking loud"

We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse

Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire away

I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, I love it
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, I love it
I love it

Fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire away
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire...
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognize your corpse
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
