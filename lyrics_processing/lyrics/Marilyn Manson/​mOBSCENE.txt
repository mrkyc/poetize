We are the things of shapes to come
Your freedom's not free and dumb, this Depression is Great
The Deformation Age, they know my name
Waltzing to scum and base and married to the pain

And it's so fucking obscene, obscene, yeah

You want commitment? Put on your best suit
Get your arms around me, now we're going down, down, down
You want commitment? Put on your best suit
Get your arms around me, now we're going down, down, down

Be obscene! Be, be obscene!
Be obscene, baby! And not heard

Bang, we want it
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
