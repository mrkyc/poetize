Bands of kids running up and down the street
Just beating people and throwing bottles at them
Playing god (x27)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I'll say it again
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I'll say it again

And you will burn in a town with no firemen
Just playing with matches and praying to ashes
Too stupid to call themselves evil
Too stupid to call themselves evil
So they call themselves heroes

This is the time for US!
This is the time for US!

We'll paint the town red, we'll paint the town red
With the blood of the tourists
We'll paint the town red, we'll paint the town red
With the blood of the tourists
You might also like
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I'll say it again
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Revelations come in twelve, I'll say it again

Traitors and betrayers
This fucking game has no fucking players
Traitors and betrayers
This fucking game has no fucking players

"You got something to say, now?"
"You got something to say, now?"
This is the time for US!
This is the time for US!

We'll paint the town red, we'll paint the town red
With the blood of the tourists
We'll paint the town red, we'll paint the town red
With the blood of the tourists

Revelations come in twelve, I'll say it again
