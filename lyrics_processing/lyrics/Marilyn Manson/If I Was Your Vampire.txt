6AM, Christmas morning
No shadows, no reflections here
Lying cheek to cheek, in your cold embrace
So soft and so tragic, as a slaughterhouse
You press the knife against your heart
And say that, "I love you so much, you must kill me now"
"I love you so much, you must kill me, now"

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come

Digging your smile apart with my spade tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together, I won't fill it alone
Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come
You might also like
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts, this is where it will end
Here comes the moon again

6:19 and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain
You'll burn and I'll eat your ashes
Impossible wheels seducing our corpse

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come

Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back
Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back
This is where it starts, this is where it will end
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
This is where it starts, this is where it will end
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
