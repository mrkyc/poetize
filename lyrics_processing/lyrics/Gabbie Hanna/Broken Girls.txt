Don't really care about your sweet talk
I only wanna hear your dark thoughts, baby
You really like the way I'm fucked up
And all you wanna do is come and save me
But when I ask the same questions
You always gotta go and change the subject
With all these one-way conversations
You got me wondering about the things left unsaid

You love 'em sick, dig up all the ugly shit
Then you offer up your remedy
Your tightened lips never let your secrets slip
Your repressed memories aren't impressing me

You like broken girls
Because they make you feel put together
Broken girls, rip it open then you'll kiss it better
Won't open up to me
Want you to talk to me
I want to get to know you
Don't just listen to me baby
Broken girls, because they make you feel put together
You might also like
No, I'm not in the mood for small talk
I only wanna know your deepest secrets
Oh, come on, let me be your detox
I'll be your diary, I won't repeat it

You love 'em sick, dig up all the ugly shit
Then you offer up your remedy
Your tightened lips never let your secrets slip
Your repressed memories aren't impressing me

You like broken girls
Because they make you feel put together
Broken girls, rip it open then you'll kiss it better
Won't open up to me
Want you to talk to me
I want to get to know you
Don't just listen to me baby
Broken girls, because they make you feel put together

You like them broken (You love 'em sick, dig up all the ugly shit)
