I still taste your presence, once sweet, but it turned sour
Tried to shake your indifference, but it's too late now
I hear you in the quiet, I see you when I'm in the dark
You just couldn't fight for this, but it's not your fault

Say what you mean out loud
Drowning in silence when I'm lost in the crowd
'Cause every sweet thing you'd never speak
It's deafening, never knowing what could be
Wish I could show you how
But you're just a ghost now

Your laughter haunts me like a ringing in my ear
You left me long ago, you're still everywhere
I reach out for you, I'm desperate for your warmth
Can you tell me where we went wrong?
At least tell me just to move on

Say what you mean out loud
Drowning in silence when I'm lost in the crowd
'Cause every sweet thing you'd never speak
It's deafening, never knowing what could be
Wish I could show you how
But you're just a ghost now
You might also like
You're just a ghost now
But you're just a ghost, ghost now
You're just a ghost, ghost now, now
But you're just a-

It's time to let it go, you left me all alone
I wanna feel your heartbeat
But it doesn't beat for me no more, no
It's time to let it go, you left me all alone
It's holding me down, it's burning me out
I'm begging for sound, but I can't bring you back now

Say what you mean out loud
Drowning in silence when I'm lost in the crowd
'Cause every sweet thing you'd never speak
It's deafening, never knowing what could be
Wish I could show you how
But you're just a ghost now

You're just a ghost now (It's time to let it go you)
But you're just a ghost, ghost now (You left me all alone)
You're just a ghost, ghost now, now (It's time to let it go)
