I knew who you were from the start
I just hoped you'd prove me wrong (Hold it)
I could spend all year just letting down my guard
While you're stringing me along
Gave it our best shot but we just missed the mark
Sad to say, "Our love is gone"
I could spend all day just picking you apart
But instead, I'll write a song

It'll go ooh, ooh
Ooh, so, instead
I'll write a song

Said I wouldn't date for a while
Still, I couldn't help but flirt (Hold It)
From the day I kissed your smile
I thought, "This is gonna hurt"
And it goes ooh, ooh
Ooh, I thought
"This is gonna hurt"
You might also like
This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt (Gonna hurt)
Give it all we can, it'll never work (Never work)
This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt
Beware of butterflies, they'll break your heart, your heart

Told me you'd never been in love
Thought that I could be the exception
It was too much to ask of you
I guess I learned my lesson
I'm bracin' for impact
Leave my heart intact
I wish you never came around
New situation with low expectations
You still manage to let me down

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, I thought
"This is gonna hurt"
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, I thought
"This is gonna hurt"

This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt (Gonna hurt)
Give it all we can, it'll never work (Never work)
This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt (Gonna hurt)
Give it all we can, it'll never work, no!
This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt (Gonna hurt)
Give it all we can, it'll never work (Never work)
This is gonna hurt, this is gonna hurt
Beware of butterflies, they'll break your heart
Butterflies, butterflies
Butterflies will break your heart (Hold it)
But if I, but if I
But if I knew from the start
Why would I? Why would I?
Why would I give this a try?
Maybe I, maybe I
