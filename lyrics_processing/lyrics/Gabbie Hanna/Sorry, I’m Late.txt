Sorry, I'm late
I lost all concept of time
No need to wait up
I don't know when I'll be fine again
For Heaven's sake
This year's one hell of a ride
And you seem to take up
A bit too much of my mind, my friend

Yeah, I've been thinkin' about
All the things I'm doing wrong
And I realized nothin' matter at all

I've been having more bad than better days
Fed up, messed up, f***** up in every way
But who cares? We're all dyin' anyway
F*** (Hey) it, f*** (Woah) it
I've done so much (Woah) that's embarrassin'
That's okay no one will remember it
Don't forget the world is about to end
F*** (Hey) it, f*** (Woah) it

Sorry I'm late
I was taking my time
Doin' my makeup
Just be glad that I arrived at all
You might also like
I'm done with thinkin' about
All the things that could go wrong
'Cause I've realized nothin' matters at all

I've been having more bad than better days
Fed up, messed up, f***** up in every way
But who cares? We're all dyin' anyway
F*** (Hey) it, f*** (Woah) it
I've done so much (Woah) that's embarrassin'
That's okay no one will remember it
Don't forget the world is about to end
F*** (Hey) it, f*** (Woah) it

Oh, Who cares? who cares?
Who cares? who cares?
Who cares? Who cares?

I've been having more bad than better days

F*** (Hey) it, f*** (Yeah) it
I've done so much (Woah) that's embarrassin'
That's okay no one will remember it
Don't forget the world is about to end
F*** (Hey) it, f*** (Woah) it
Who cares? who cares?
