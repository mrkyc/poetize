I'm surrounded by stars
But they don't hear me wishin'
It's funny how a crowded room
Can feel so damn alone
They can't hear my mind
Or maybe they're just not listenin'
So I remind myself
I'm better off on my own

Been standing on the edge
For way too long
Just waiting for the place
That I belong

I'm a satellite, I'm a satellite
I'm on the outside lookin' in
They don't know just where I've been
I'm a satellite unless you let me in

These indigo nights
It's the life that I've been livin'
But when the sun comes up
That's when the shadows grow
They think they got it all
They don't know what they're missin'
I got so much to give
But I'm keeping it close
You might also like
These days are slow
But the night moves way too fast
Need to know
You want me here before I ask

I'm a satellite, I'm a satellite
I'm on the outside lookin' in
They don't know just where I've been
I'm a satellite unless you let me in

Guess I gotta be content
With playin' in the darkness
A lovely place to hide, whoa
But hide and seek is only fun if
If somebody's lookin'
And nobody's got the time

Or maybe I'm too quick
To pass the blame
Maybe I should ask
Someone to play
I'm a satellite, I'm a satellite
I'm on the outside lookin' in
They don't know just where I've been
I'm a satellite

I'm a satellite, I'm a satellite
I can make it on my own
The fallen star of a one-man show
I'm a satellite

I'm a satellite, I'm a satellite
I'm on the outside lookin' in
Want you to know just where I've been
Don't wanna be a satellite
