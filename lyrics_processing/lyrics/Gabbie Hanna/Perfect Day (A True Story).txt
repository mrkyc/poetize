It was a perfect day
Oh, how I've missed this
Such a perfect day
Just two misfits sharing kisses

And after all this time, you give me butterflies, butterflies
Months go by, I still get butterflies, butterflies
Perfect day, what did I do to deserve this?

Went back to your house
And we couldn't help but hold each other
Tangled at the mouth
Took a break so I could take a shower
Washed the sand out of my hair
From our perfect day spent at the beach
Looked into the foggy mirror
Saw a message staring back at me

After all this time, you give me butterflies, butterflies
Months go by, I still get butterflies, butterflies
Perfect day, what did I do to deserve this?
You might also like
I saw "I love you" written in the steam
And I couldn't help but smile
At the sweet message you left me
But it wasn't in your handwriting
Then those happy little letters
Were the saddest things I've ever seen

You need to get your conscience clean
But just spare me the details, please
I wanna keep remembering
This perfect day
I'm not the type to be left speechless
But I don't think I can deal with this
That's all the closure that you'll give
This perfect day
Justifications veiled as apologies
I don't wanna cause a scene
Please let me go, I just wanna leave
This perfect day

Oh, how could you miss this?
Wish you would have wiped it away
Let me live in blissful ignorance
And let me have this perfect day
But you left it all in ruins
We ended on a perfect day
Really wish I could forget this
'Cause after all this time you give me butterflies, butterflies
Why'd you lie? Don't hurt my butterflies, butterflies
Watch them die, you killed my butterflies, butterflies
Butterflies ruined my perfect day
