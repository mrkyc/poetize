Leather skin
With a broken heart
Good seamen
Turned to piracy
Turned to the sea
For opportunity
A good boy, men
Please forgive him

His sins
His sins
Oh he knows not where he's been

Clear the decks, there's gonna be a shipwreck
Follow his heart back to the start
He's just a boy
Clear the decks, there's gonna be a shipwreck
Follow his heart back to the start
Tell the mistress
He's just a boy

Broken man
With a leather heart
He turned to the sea
For opportunity
A pirate's grin
Overcoming him

Oh he knows not where she's been

Clear the decks, there's gonna be a shipwreck
Follow his heart back to the start
He's just a boy
Clear the decks, there's gonna be a shipwreck
Follow his heart back to the start
Tell the mistress
He's just a boy

Follow the map
Of his broken heart
Back to the start
Of his broken heart
Follow the map
Back to the start
Of his broken heart

Bury him at sea
He'll never return to me
Forgive him all his sins
He knows not where he's been
Bury him at sea
He'll never return to me
Forgive him all his sins
The mistress of the sea deceived him
Bury him at sea
He'll never return to me
Follow his heart
Back to the start
He's just a boy
Follow his heart
Back to the start
Clear the decks, there's gonna be a shipwreck
Lost at sea
Follow her heart
Back to the start
Follow the start
Back to the heart
Lost at sea
Clear the decks, there's gonna be a shipwreck
Bury him at sea
He'll never return to me
The mistress of the sea deceived him
