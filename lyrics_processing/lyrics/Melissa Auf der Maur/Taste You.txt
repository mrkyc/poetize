Oh my love, oh my love, I can't hear you my love
Tell me where have you gone?
Oh my love, oh my love, I can't taste you my love
Tell me what have I done?
Plug it in
So I can digest you, I will taste you

Far away, far away, I can't feel you today
I need healing my love
Appetite running fast, following my gut
Turning up every rock
You're disappearing my love
I need louder than this, please fill me up
Goof tidings I bring
To you and your sins, I'll forgive

Come to me, plug it in
So I can digest you
I will taste you
My appetite in that hole
I'll tempt you with it now
I will taste you
You might also like
Please shake me and tug
I need shaking my love
Can't you be the one?
I can't fake it my love
I need filling come on
I need it louder than bombs

Come to me, plug it in
So I can digest you
I will taste you
My appetite in that hole
I'll tempt you with it now
I will taste you

Feel that movement my love?
Pulling up from above
Are you listening love?
My emptiness in a way
Is tempting
Guiding you from my gut

I will taste you
I will taste you
(I've got a big mouth)
I've got a big mouth
(I will taste you)
I will taste you
(I've got a big mouth)
I've got a big mouth
I will taste you
(I will taste you)
I will taste you
(I've got a big mouth)
(I will taste you)
I will taste you
Oh my love, oh my love
I can't hear you my love
Tell me where have you gone?
Far away, far away
I can't feel you today
I need healing my love
Oh my love, oh my love
