I'm so proud you made me your girl
I am honored to be your lady
I'm so proud to be your baby
No matter, whatever kind of day
Have to weigh priorities
Feel it's best to push other things aside
Focus on our private lives
More time, everything is fine
Yet I sense you doubt me
Hearsay has a funny way
Making good look ugly
Friend of mine I guess in need of reassuring, oh, yeah
I love, love with you it's all in all inspiring
Ooh, it's so good to be in your world

(So proud)
I am honored to be your lady
