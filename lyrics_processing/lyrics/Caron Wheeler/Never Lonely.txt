(Oh)
Never could I leave you lonely
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Always be there by your side
(Oh, be there for you)
Never could I leave you lonely
Yeah, yeah
Saving my everything
Praying the telephone will bring your voice
Holding my every care
Wishing you could be here to share my joy
Be aware that in so many ways I'm here for you
Oh, whoa, whoa
Forgive me for the fuss
I don't mean to rush
I wanna be fair with you
Do all that a lover could do
Always, always on my mind
(Oh, hey)
Never could I leave you lonely
(Oh, I wanna be there for you, babe)
Always be there by your side
(Oh, be there for you)
Never could I leave you lonely
Hey, yeah

I feel that you were heaven-sent for me
Tasting of summer's wine
Never knew life could be so fine and free, oh
Everyday we're permitted to play this lover's game

I don't mean to rush
This feeling's safe with me
And I'll be all a lover could be
Always, always on my mind

Never could I leave you lonely
Always be there by your side
Never could I leave you lonely

(Hey, yeah)
Living and learning
(With your love)
The strongest must survive
Always, always on my mind
Never could I leave you lonely
(Oh, always)
Always be there by your side
