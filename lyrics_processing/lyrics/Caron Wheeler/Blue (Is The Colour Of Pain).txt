Yes, oh
Uh-huh...
Whoo-oo-oo-oo...
Remember me, I was the one
Who said love was blind
And like a fool, I ran to you
Whenever you would cry
Take me back, that's what you said
I could never turn you away, no
Take me back, oh, that's what you said
And, oh, how a fool must pay
Blue
(Blue, blue, whoa)
That's the color of pain
(Oh, yes it is, oh, yes it is now)
Blue, blue
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
That's the color of pain
Exactly how I'll never know
You manage to persuade
Those in your life to buy your lines
And see the world your way
One more chance, is that all you say
I could never turn you away, oh, no
One more chance, oh, is all you say
The price that a fool must pay

That's the color of pain
(Oh, oh, exactly how I'll never know)
Blue, blue
That's the color of pain
(How, hey, yeah)
Blue
That's the color of pain
(Color of my pain)
Blue, blue, blue
That's the color of pain
Only hope you'll never know this pain
Hey
It's such a shame
Many tears have run dry
I've cried out all I've left to cry
For now it's time
To break that hold her spell
You thought up long ago
I'll see you later, love
I really must be gone
This fool is telling you goodbye
Blue
(Blue, yeah)
That's the color of pain
(Color of my pain, oh)
(And it's a blue world)
Blue, blue
That's the color of pain
Only hope you'll never know
(Blue)
I'll never know how you persuade
Those in your life to see the world your way
(Pain)
I'll never know how you persuade
Those in your life to see the world your way
(Blue, blue)
I'll never know how you persuade
Those in your life to see the world your way
(Pain)
I'll never know how you persuade
Those in your life to see the world your way
Blue
(Who said that)
That's the color of pain
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo...
Blue, blue, blue
(Yeah, yeah)
That's the color of pain
Only hope you'll never know
