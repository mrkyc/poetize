Your philosophy of family love
Saying we could all be stronger together
Build a foundation for the yout's coming up
Solid theory, felt like the right one
Working beside you took up my position
Success, called us to the top of the ladder
But you turned saying 'don't come any closer'
This is mine, don't come any closer
Oh no, you're way too close
This is mine, don't come any closer
Now you're dissing us, yet call us your sisters
But things can never be the same again
From now on I'll be keeping my distance
Bad company I can't entertain
You said you'd never turn your back on anyone
Empty promises all you've ever given
Success called us to the top of the ladder
But your words are always around
This is mine, don't come any closer
Don't come any closer, no, oh...
This is mine, don't come any closer
Whatever happened to family love, babe
You might also likeThis is mine, don't come any closer
You said you'd never turn you back on me, oh, no
This is mine, don't come any closer
Hey-hey, yeah
Whoo, yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh...
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Success is a pure fact
Now watch me big up my chest and you know that
As for the concept, girl, this child belongs to me
Belongs to I, to moi, yet not clear to see
Through-the fact is I keep my distance
And though I'm drifting, you're persisting
To rise to greater heights, will you need me
To struggle, fess or fight, will you leave me
Although my heart is pure, people force me
To read between the lines of this story
The end result leaves a thought like an odor
And this is mine, don't come any closer
The family vibes, coincides in a small pack
That's why I turned my back, but life's like that
I search and I search in my mind and I find
This is mine, yes, this is mine!
You said you'd never turn your back on anyone
Success called us to the top of the ladder
But your words are always around, babe
This is mine, don't come any closer
Don't come closer, no, hey
This is mine, don't come any closer
I'll never see for the things you believe in, yeah
This is mine, don't come any closer
Don't come any closer, no
This is mine, don't come any closer
This is mine
