This is captain-

Perfect, picture one so picture perfect
As your lies disguised as loving arms
The future looked so bright, but it was blinding
Oh, I couldn't see the man behind the charm

Then we closed the doors and the lights came on
And I saw the real you
No, I don't like him
Don't like how it feels
I want a new you

It's taking everything in me
Not to hurt you like you hurt me, eh
Cause I wanna get you back, but I gotta keep moving
Boy, I swear you don't know
It's taking everything in me

Searching, searching, still can't find an answer
Cause all this wasn't part of the plan
So now it ends full of pain and questions
Oh, where do we go from here? Ahh
You might also like
Cause behind closed doors, when the lights are on
You become the real you
No, I don't like him
Don't like how it feels
I want a new you

It's taking everything in me
Not to hurt you like you hurt me, whoa
Cause I wanna get you back, but I gotta keep moving
Boy, I swear you don't know
It's taking everything in me

Sometimes people hurt you
That just means they don't deserve you
And you want to do the same to hurt them back
(It's taking all of me)
But this one's for you know who
You're the one who looks like a fool
And there's no greater revenge better than that

But it's still taking everything in me
Not to hurt you like you hurt me
And I just wanna get you back but I gotta keep moving
Swear you just don't know
It's taking everything in me
Everything in me (Oh)
Everything in me (Oh, whoa)
Everything
Everything in me (In me)
Everything
Not to do to you (Everything...)
