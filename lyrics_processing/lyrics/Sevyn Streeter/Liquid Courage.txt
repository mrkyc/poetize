Losin' myself to keep your shit together but (Keep your shit together)
It doesn't matter now (Matter now, matter now)

You can't afford this place, no

You can't afford to stay
Can't even afford the mistakes you made

It don't make no sense (Don't make no sense)

You had the world in your hand (You had the world in your hand)
Do you know the price of the body you had in your bed? (Your bed)

So maybe I'll fuck one of these ballers I see on TV
'Cause at least I get a diamond every time he says he's sorry, sorry (Sorry)

Losin' myself to keep your shit together but (Keep your shit together)
