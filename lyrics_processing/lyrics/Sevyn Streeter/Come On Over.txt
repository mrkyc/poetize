On my mind just one thing
You and me doing some things
No particular one place, I'm wrong, oh
Open to changes, positions, and angles
Tonight I ain't no angel, oh, no, no

Boy, what you waiting for?
It's open house, why don't you take a tour
You got them keys so open up the door
Oh, you're what I need, boy, I been looking forward to you
I'll be waiting

I been thinking 'bout you
Can't get you off my mind
And if I gave it to you, boy, could you love me right
But I won't have to wonder
If you just come on over
Boy, could you drive me crazy
Take me for a ride
Would it be amazing
If I was yours tonight
But I won't have to wonder
If you just come on over
You might also like
Sent me a message
You don't usually text me
Say you want me for breakfast, oh oh
