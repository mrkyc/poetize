I'm feeling like we're nowhere near home
Don't know where we went wrong
Why it gotta come to this for?
Can't get caught up throwing stones at a glass house

If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect
'Cause you keep pointing fingers
And I'll keep pointing fingers
It's like we're throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters

What you givin' me that look for?
Baby, this ain't nothing but a conversation
This love got me locked up, got me feeling like I'm on probation
I keep holding on
I need you to chase me like you chase paper, baby
Roll with me like you rolling paper
I'm open if you open
Open if you open
I'm down, down
You might also like
If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect
'Cause you keep pointing fingers
And I'll keep pointing fingers
It's like we're throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters
It just shatters
It keeps shattering
Nothing matters
If it's no trust between these four walls
And it's all built up on lies, it falls
Then it shatters
Control me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Control me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Control me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Control me, squeeze me and hold me
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect
'Cause you keep pointing fingers
And I'll keep pointing fingers
It's like we're throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters
It just shatters
It keeps shattering
Nothing matters
If there's no trust between these four walls
And it's all built up on lies, it falls
Then it shatters
Control me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Control me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Control me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
