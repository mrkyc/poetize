We used to be laid up, posted
On the same page on our blow shit
Never had to try, we was close then
Now I look at you, I don't even notice
First I was off it, on it
Couldn't figure out what you wanted
You was out here on your hoe shit
Man fucked outta here, yeah I noticed

Now I'm just sitting here laughin'
Watching you lying and beggin'
Now I'm just sitting here laughin'
How we used to be laid up, posted
On the same page, on our flow shit, yeah

Now you all alone, ain't this about a bitch
When I stop chasing you and now you wanna chase me
When I stop loving you and now you wanna love me
When I stop caring 'bout me, now you wanna care
Care about you, care about you
Ain't this about a bitch
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being

Laid up, new boo, this right here don't concern you
Smiling like I'm supposed to
I bet you think it's about you
But the truth is, he is the fuckin' king, he's the realest
Dwelling all in my fortress, no

Now I'm just sitting here laughin'
Watching you lying and beggin'
Now I'm just sitting here laughin'
How we used to be laid up, posted
On the same page, on the floor shit, yeah
Now you all alone, ain't this about a bitch
When I stop chasing you and now you wanna chase me
When I stop loving you and now you wanna love me
When I stop caring 'bout me, now you wanna care
Care about you, care about you
What goes around comes all the way back around

Ain't this about a bitch
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being
(What goes up comes down)
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being
(It comes right back to you)
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being
(Careful what you do)
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being
Ain't about a bitch
Ain't about a bitch
Ain't this about a bitch

When I was chasing you and now you wanna chase me
When I was  loving you and now you wanna love me
When I was caring 'bout me, now you wanna care
Now you wanna care

Ain't this about a bitch
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being
(Make you look like a bitch)
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being
(Tears falling down your face)
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being
(It feels so good to see you like that)
I'm just being honest, I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest, I'm just being

I always knew you would, I always knew you would
Always knew this day would come
