(My heart)
(Is yearning for your love)
KP did it

You don't like me? Say it to my face
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you say
Caught up in the rapture like I'm baker
I'mma need a check to conversate
Hurt your feelings shit, I don't know what to say
Try to make it physical I fuck around and catch a case
Now you wanna start them complications
Pussy niggas always talking crazy
Thought I was in love, that was a phase
I was just a rookie trying to play
I don't trust you, that's why I got reservations
Tell me what you're bringing to the table
I am not going outta my way
Wasting my time, you wasting my day
I see you lookin' salty, how it taste?
I see you lookin' salty, how it taste?

('Cause my heart)
(Is yearnin' for your love)
Yuh, Yuh
I don't give a fuck now
All these niggas wanna fuck now
Always tryna keep in touch for now
Think I need to be alone for the night
I might do a little wrong, it'll be alright
Now you in a situation you don't like
Got you singing sad songs, you gon' be alright
('Cause my heart)
(Is yearnin' for your love...)
You might also like
Take a picture of my figure
Look like Big Booty Keisha
In the hood ridin' round, chilling with the dope dealers
And my clique so brown, look like chocolate bars
We be eatin' so lavish, caviar
And we got a bad habit of buying more, nigga
Walk up in this muthafucka
And walk out with your nigga
Walk up in this muthafucka
And walk out with your bitch
Walk up in this muthafucka
Got you bitches nervous

(My heart is yearning for you)
(Let me inside your love)
Yuh, Yuh
I don't give a fuck now
All these niggas wanna fuck now
Always tryna keep in touch for now
Think I need to be alone for the night
I might do a little wrong, it'll be alright
Now you in a situation you don't like
Got you singing sad songs, you gon' be alright
('Cause my heart)
