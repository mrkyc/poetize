I love when you pulling up in your jeep
Pumping all your beats
J's on, with your shades on
Just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets
But when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing no
So I hop up in your ride
Ooh, it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down with the doors closed
Put your hand on my thigh
Drive slow, oh, take your time

Every little thing you do, got me feeling some type of way
When you gimme that thunder you make my summer rain
(Oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh oh)
Everyday, everyday

And it won't stop
Boom, boom, booooomm
And it won't stop
Boom, boom, boooooomm
With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop
Boom, boom, boommmm
You might also like
I love when we pulling up to the beach, sand down in my feet
Sun down, nobody around, that's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body, rock, rock the boat, Aaliy-ah
Don't it sound famil-ar, cause it feels like (ah, ah, aye, aye)
Looking up in space, just me and my babe
And it feels so amazing, oh-oh, all night

Every little thing you do, got me feeling some type of way
When you gimme that thunder you make my summer rain
(Oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh oh)
Everyday, everyday

And it won't stop
Boom, boom, booooomm
And it won't stop
Boom, boom, boooooomm
With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop
Boom, boom, boommmm

Everyday, everyday, I can't breathe
You take my breath away from me
Heres my heart, you got the key
Put that on eternity
I love you till infinity, infinity, infinity
Infinity, infinity
My everything, my everything
And when I think about it be making me weak, baby
It won't ever stop
My heart won't skip a beat, baby
And it'll keep going on, going on, going on
And it won't stop
Boom, boom, booooomm
And it won't stop
Boom, boom, boooooomm
With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop
