I love when you pullin' up in your Jeep (Pullin' up in your Jeep)
Bumpin' all your beats (Bumpin' all your beats)
J's on with your shades on
Just to bring me somethin' to eat
You the man up in these streets (You the man up in these streets)
But when it comes to my heart (My heart)
That don't mean a thing, no, oh

Baby, hop in my ride, oooh, it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down with your doors closed
With my hand up on your thigh
Drive slow, ooh, take your time

Every little thing you do got me feelin' some type of way
When you give me that thunder, you make my summer rain
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Every day, every day

And it won't stop, boom, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (Yeah)
With every single part of me (Oh), my love for you is constantly (Oh)
Forever and ever on repeat (Oh), on repeat
And it won't stop, boom, boom, boom
You might also like
I love when we pullin' up to that beach (That beach)
Sand down in my feet (Yeah)
Sun down, nobody 'round
That's one hell of a scene
You rockin' my body (Body)
Rock-rock the boat, Aaliyah (Body)
Don't it sound familiar?

And you sound like, uh-uh, ayy-ayy
Lookin' up into spa-ace
It's just me and my ba-ae
And we feel so amazin'
Oh-oh, all night, woah

Every little thing you do got me feelin' some type of way (Way, yeah, way)
When you give me that thunder, you make my summer rain
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Every day, every day

And it won't stop (No), boom, boom, boom
And it won't stop, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (Yeah)
With every single part of me (Me, oh), my love for you is constantly (Oh)
Forever and ever on repeat (Oh), on repeat
And it won't stop, no, boom, boom, boom
Every day, every day, I can't wait
You take my breath away from me
Here's my heart, you got the key
Put that on eternity
I love you 'til infinity, infinity (Oh), infinity, infinity (Oh), infinity
My every day, my every day
And when I think about it, oh, it be makin' me weak, baby
I won't ever stop, my heart won't skip a beat, baby
And it'll keep goin' on, goin' on, goin' on

And it won't stop (No), boom, boom, boom (I'm so in love with you, girl)
And it won't stop, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (Yeah)
With every single part of me (Oh), my love for you is constantly (Oh)
Forever and ever on repeat (Oh), on repeat
And it won't stop, boom, boom, boom (Boom)
And it won't stop

Girl I'm, rockin' your body
Rock-rockin' your body (Won't stop)
Rock-rockin' your body, baby (Won't stop)
Said I'm rockin' your body
Rockin' your body to sleep
And it won't stop, boom, boom, boom
