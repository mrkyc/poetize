When I first started this journey of writing this album, all I thought of was just making, you know, good songs. "I want the drums to be like this, and the keys to be like this, and the guitar to be like this," and then I came across this title, "Girl Disrupted," and I loved it so much, but little did I know that that shit was actually gonna happen to me in life for real. And so here I am, you know, towards the end of finishing my album, creating my album, and then that's where I went through probably the most craziest shit I ever went through in my whole entire life. (Suffer with depression, I suffer with depression) So this album for me is more than just music, it's more than just music
Love, loyalty, and liberation. Girl Disrupted.

I lost a fight with my heart
I lost my way in the dark
On a roller coaster, up and down
But look at me now, look at me now

Got the whole world looking at me, feeling crazy
Hard times in my feelings, suffocating
All of them taking credit like they made me
I've been waiting on this moment for a long time
And I'ma be damned if I let 'em count me out yet

And I'm betting on myself
Oh, and living without a care
Go on, sit back and watch 'em stare
Oh, I am living without a care

Brand new me
I know that you got your eyes on me
So hey bitch, hey bitch, hey bitch, hey bitch
Back to the stars
Miles away in a broken car
I lost my faith tryna find myself
But now I'm back like I never left
You might also like
I had the whole world looking at me, feeling crazy
Hard times in my feelings, suffocating
All of them taking credit, like they made me
But I've been waiting on this moment for a long time
And I'ma be damned if I let 'em count me out yet

And I'm betting on myself
Oh, and living without a care
Go on, sit back and watch 'em stare
Oh, I am living without a care (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, living without a care (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I am living without a care

Brand new me (yeah)
Brand new, brand new me (yeah)
Brand new, brand new me (yeah)
Brand new me, living without a care
Brand new me (yeah)
Brand new, brand new me (yeah)
Brand new, brand new me (yeah)
Brand new me, living without a care
Brand new me (yeah)
Brand new, brand new me (yeah)
Brand new, brand new me (yeah)
