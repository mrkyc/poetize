I mean, so what you really mad about, like for real?
Cause you say its something but you ain't saying nothing and you Saying stuff
But you ain't saying nothing
Everybody grown 'til its time to have a conversation

Your volume kinda high
See you at a ten, need you at a five
I already know what you'd do if I came home same time as you at night
I ain't do shit, why you picking fights?
Won't you open up, boy, what's on your mind?
Trying to read your mind, it's a waste of time
Let go of your pride
Cause any other time, I would lose my patience, oh baby
Any other time, I would lose my interest, oh baby
Any other situation, I would just say fuck it, go and get a new bag, a new man, a new issue, yeah

If we both shut up, we won't be so lost in translation
If we just light up, we won't be so low in translation
Translation
I don't want to give you up on nothing
I don't want to give you up on no one
All I want to do is just love you better, better
Baby, love you better
You know I'm the one, why you fronting?
If you just listen when I talk
If you just be quiet when I say what I need from you
Then we'll do much better
You might also like
I'll trade all my lovin'
Anything for your honesty, give everything for you to open up
Baby, we just goin' through a phase
And I'll be over like everyday
Crash into you without no breaks
You know I'm a different woman
Cause any other time, I would lose my patience, oh baby
Any other time, I would lose my interest, oh baby
Any other situation, I would just say fuck it and get a different bag, a new situation, new issues

But if we both shut up, we won't be so lost in translation
If we just light up, we won't be so low in translation
Translation
I don't want to give you up on nothing
I don't want to give you up on no one
All I want to do is just love you better, better
