Usually when I call you at 3 o' clock in the morning, you just pick up
And every time at around 12 o' clock on your lunch break
When I text you, you hit me back
Then yesterday when I saw your best friend around the corner
Asking about your whereabouts
He said he thought I was with you, I was at my mama house
And you wasn't there, you wasn't there

Where the hell have you been?
Have you found a new friend?
Is this so omega, the beginning of the end
(I can really change it)
Is my love in competition
(Really change it)
Who's been playing my position?
(I can really change it)
Am i losing, is she winning?
(Really change it)
Is my love in competition
Is my love in competition

I bet she don't she look like me, I bet she don't cook like me
I bet you her sense of humor ain't on, she ain't making you laugh like me
Bet you your cousin sister, your mama, auntie, you don't love her like me
What if she ain't or what if she is, if she really even exists
You might also like
If she is or if she ain't, there's something I just gotta know
You've been on that new shit lately, swear I don't know you no more
Used to feel like summer but lately you've been feeling so cold
Something like a tundra coldest winter ever felt before

Where the hell have you been?
Have you found a new friend?
Is this so omega, the beginning of the end
Is my love in competition
Is my love in competition

I bet she don't she look like me, bet you she don't cook like me
I bet you her sense of humor ain't on, she ain't making you laugh like me
Bet you your cousin sister, your mama, auntie, you don't love her like me
What if she ain't or what if she is, if she really even exists

Acting like the man that I know who ain't
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't
Acting like the man that I know who ain't
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't

Doing nothing, but all you say is you ain't doing nothing
Tell me something, cause if you don't I'm gon' be begging
Where the hell have you been
Where the fuck have you been?
Is my love in, is my love in, is my love in, is my love in competition?
Is my love in competition?
I bet she don't she look like me, bet you she don't cook like me
I bet you her sense of humor ain't on, she ain't making you laugh like me
Bet you your cousin sister, your mama, auntie, you don't love her like me
What if she ain't or what if she is, if she really even exists

If you don't want me to jump to no conclusions baby
