World goes round, life I chose
What comes next? I never really know
A million miles left to go
Them guns go "pow" but I'm ready for the war

'Cause I'll never run away from who knocking at my door
I never paid attention to whoever tells me "no"
I take your crown, take your town
Better stay ready, better stay ready

If the sky start falling now
And the world stop turnin' round (Oh yeah)
Did you give your everything?
You better give your everything
'Cause if you wanna ride with me (Oh yeah)
Make me come alive, baby (Oh yeah)
Said if you wanna ride with me (Oh yeah)
If you wanna ride with me
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)

(Oh) Oh yeah

(Oh) How bad do you-

Gunnin' for it all, going for the gold
Hot behind the wheel, I'll never lose control
Sun go down, night unfold
I'm free and wild, do anything I want

'Cause I'll never run away from who knocking at my door
I never paid attention to whoever tells me "no"
I take your crown, take your town
Better stay ready, better stay ready

If the sky start falling now
And the world stop turnin' round (Oh yeah)
Did you give your everything?
You better give your everything
'Cause if you wanna ride with me (Oh yeah)
Make me come alive, baby (Oh yeah)
Said if you wanna ride with me (Oh yeah)
If you wanna ride with me
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)

Better show me now
'Fore your time run out
Better show me
'Fore your time run out

Show me how bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
(Oh) Oh yeah
