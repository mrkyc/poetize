Must be heard to leave your girl left to die
Oh, is this part of that new wave that you lame as fuck whenever you try?
When this shit first started, you would ask me
Why was I so afraid to let you inside?
And I fell for that shit, maybe your heart's been too hard for too long
Now maybe its time

I'm so fucking left field
Tears in my eyes, I'm going through your whole phone
Fuck you ask me, "Why?"
Nigga, need your head blown

Now I've been unfortunately forced to draw the line
You got me all in this mirror, trying to hold all this blame and I know it's not mine
And all you got to say is "It ain't mean nothing"
That's how you justify your hoes?
And even if I choose to forgive, it won't be the same as before

I'm so fucking left field
Tears in my eyes, I'm going through your whole phone
