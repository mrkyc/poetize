I mean, I just bought some house shoes the other day
They're like couple-thousand-lexus-on-my-house shoes

New coupe with my top off
You trip and may pop off
Never rock no knock off
Waitress, where the hot sauce?
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off

Boy, this ass is so real
Thicker than some oat meal
Look like I ate four meals
Diamonds worth like four mill
I just signed 'bout four deals
Fuck like I took four pills
Strip club, I paid four bills
St. Louis, you get so killed
Rollin' with them robbers
Bust your enchiladas
Machetes and them choppas
Bustin' at the coppas
Wave it out the window
Do this for my kin folk
Just got the new Benzo
On them new Lorenzos
You might also like
New coupe with my top off
You trip and may pop off
Never rock no knock off
Waitress, where the hot sauce?
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off

Benz is goin' awall
Contract like I play ball
Never take a day off
Bitch, you might get layed off
Judges I done payed off
Just to get the yayo
Quadramin like Adolf
Bitch, your shit is way off
Titties look like melons
All my boyfriends felons
No snitchin', no tellin'
Pussy wet, go sailin'
Make 'em stalk my pages
Wanna give me babies
All you bitches bitin'
I think y'all got rabies
New coupe with my top off
You trip and may pop off
Never rock no knock off
Waitress, where the hot sauce?
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off

Ooh shit, ooh shit
Who is this?
When you see this bitch you double click
Doub-double click shit

New coupe with my top off
You trip and may pop off
Self-self-selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
Selfies with my top off
