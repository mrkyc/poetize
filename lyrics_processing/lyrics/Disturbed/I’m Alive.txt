Never again will I be dishonored
And never again will I be reminded
Of living within the world of the jaded
They kill inspiration, it's my obligation
To never again allow this to happen
Where do I begin? The choices are endless
Denying the sin, my art, my redemption
I carry the torch of my fathers before me

The thing I treasure the most in life
Cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why
I will surrender to your advice
To change myself, I'd rather die
Though they will not understand
I won't make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive

I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

Change again cannot be considered
I rage again, dispelling my anger
Where do I begin? The choices are endless
My art, my redemption, my only salvation
I carry the gift that I have been blessed with
My soul is adrift in oceans of madness
Repairing the rift that you have created
I am not alone, brothers, give me your arms now

The thing I treasure most in life
Cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why
I will surrender to your advice
To change myself, I'd rather die
Though they will not understand
I won't make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive

I'm no slave, are you feeling brave?
Or have you gone out of your mind?
No more games, it won't feel the same
If I hold my anger inside
There's no meaning; my soul is bleeding
I've had enough of your kind
One suggestion: Use your discretion
Before you label me blind
The thing I treasure most in life
Cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why
I will surrender to your advice
To change myself, I'd rather die
Though they will not understand
I won't make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive

I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
