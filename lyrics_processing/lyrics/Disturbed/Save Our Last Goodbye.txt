Hello. Please leave a message after the tone
 Hey, just calling you back
I'm feeling pretty good today actually, didn't throw up at all
Yeah, tomorrow, I got this procedure
I think everything is gonna go smooth there, though
Um, I'm hoping anyway
I need some good news for once

Don't wanna hear it's over
What a rude awakening
The angel of death has come
And ripped you from our lives
I can't stand the devastation
Relentless agony
Hope that I get to see you
On the other side

Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

What faith I had is broken
And I question everything
And those shards of doubt
Begin to penetrate my heart
With every waking hour
Within everything I see
The shadows of your loss
Are tearing me apart

Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

 We're sorry
This mailbox is full and cannot take your messages
My world is shattered, in disarray
I'm beaten down, drained emotionally
They say, in time, the pain goes away
But in my soul, it will forever stay

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

 We're sorry
