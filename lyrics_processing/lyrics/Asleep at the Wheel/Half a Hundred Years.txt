I've missed a lot of things, I know
I've missed you once again
You ask me where I've been, my friend
Well, I've been 'round the bend
And back again and here again
I missed you, friend, I fear
It's just I've been on the road for half a hundred years

Hills and dales tell many tales
I've heard them all, my friend
With Willie, we've been back and forth
The road, it never ends
From Bakersfield like Buck and Merle
We've lived a hundred years
I'll tell you, friends, I've seen a lot in half a hundred years

Five times ten or ten times five times two makes quite a sum
Halfa that makes fifty years, boys, it's been quite a run
So start the jam, roll one up, and ice another beer
I tip my hat and raise a toast to half a hundred years

It might seem long, don't get me wrong
Most y'all would agree
The fashion's changed, they changed the game
And then the locks don't fit the key
It's nothin' to be feared, my friend
No need to shed a tear
It's just I never thought I'd last a half a hundred years

I watched the same Sun burn the sand
Melt the mountain snow
I sailed the seas and felt the breeze
That only sailors know
I've played the king, seen many things
That often bring a tear
You'll see a lot if you hang around for half a hundred years

Five times ten or ten times five times two makes quite a sum
Halfa that makes fifty years, boys, it's been quite a run
So start the jam, roll one up, and ice another beer
I tip my hat and raise a toast to half a hundred years

Yeah
Half a hundred years, mm
Might catch up to Willie one-a these days
Ah, my, my, my
Hope you like it, Jamie
Half a hundred years
Half a hundred years
Half a hundred years
Half a hundred years
Half a hundred years
Half a hundred years
Half a hundred, half a hundred
Half a hundred years
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-bye
