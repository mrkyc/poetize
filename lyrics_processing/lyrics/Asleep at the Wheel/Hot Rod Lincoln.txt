If you don't stop drivin' that - Hot ... Rod ... Lincoln!'
Have you heard the story of the hot rod race
When the Ford and the Lincolns were settin' the pace?
That story's true I'm here to say
Cause I was drivin' that Model A
It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up;
And that Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got 8 cylinders and uses 'em all;
Got overdrive that just won't stall
With 4-barrel carbs and a dual exhaust
And 4:11 gears, you can really get lost -
Got safety too but I ain't scared
The brakes are good and the tires fair
We pulled out of San Pedro late one night;
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright
We was drivin' up ol' Grapevine Hill
Passin' cars like they were standin' still
All of a sudden, in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys, "That's a mark for me."
By then, the taillights was all you could see

So I thought I'd make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and, man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive
Well, I wound it up to 110;
My speedometer said that I'd hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor;
That's all there is - there ain't no more
Now the boys all thought that I'd lost my sense;
And them telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, "Slow down, I see spots."
The lines on the road just looked like dots
We took a corner, side swiped a truck;
And I crossed my fingers just for luck -
And my was fenders clickin' the guard rail post;
The guy beside me was white as a ghost
Smoke was comin from outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and I thought I could pass
Don't ya know by then, we'd be low on gas
I had flames comin' from out of the side;
You could feel the tension; man, what a ride
I said, "Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly"
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by
All of a sudden she started a-knockin';
Down in the depths she started a-rockin'
I looked in the mirror and a red light was blinkin';
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln
Well they arrested me and put me in jail
They called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, 'Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
