We started out with good intentions
Making love right there in the kitchen
You and me were getting along just fine, got along just fine
More than crazy about one another
I was your man and you were my lover
Glad that I was yours and you were mine

And for a while, I could do no wrong
You laughed at my jokes and you danced to my songs
Not to bad for an Amarillo country boy, but in a country boy
I said if we could just stay together
It could be just like this forever
Finer things in life we would enjoy

You told me you thought that I was wrong
You said our love wouldn't last too long
I don't want to leave you all alone
So should I stay or should I go back home

Am I right or Amarillo
Do I stay here with you or hit the road
Am I right or Amarillo
I love you, but I can always go back home

Now, pretty soon it was just like I figured
You told me that you'd reconsidered
I could stay with you and be your man, be your loving man
Now it seems there's a brand new problem
Country boys learn their lessons when they're taught 'em
I've learned about as much as I can stand

Now I'm the one who thinks that I was wrong
I don't think our love is gonna last too long
I really, really, really hate to leave you all alone
But Texas is a calling me back home

Am I right or Amarillo
Do I stay here with you or hit the road
Am I right or Amarillo
I love you, but I can always go back home

Now, it might be as flat as a pancake
But how much heartache can one man take
Amarillo, we've been too long apart, been too long apart
There's no need for me to keep on talking
If I'm a going, I'd better start walking
