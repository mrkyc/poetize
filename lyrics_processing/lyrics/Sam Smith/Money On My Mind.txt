When I signed my deal, I felt pressure
Don't want to see the numbers, I want to see heaven
You say "Could you write a song for me?"
I say "I'm sorry, I won't do that" happily

When I go home, I tend to close the door
I never wanted more, so sing with me
Can't you see?

I don't have money on my mind, money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind, money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love

Please don't get me wrong, I wanna keep it movin'
I know what that requires, I'm not foolish
Please, can you make this work for me?
'Cause I'm not a puppet, I will work against your strings

I don't have money on my mind, money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind, money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

I do it for the love
I do it for the love

When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
When the sun will set, don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
Just love
Money on my mind, money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind, money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

I do it for the love
