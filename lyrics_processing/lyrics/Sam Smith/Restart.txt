It was a Monday night when you told me it was over babe
And by the Friday night, I knew that I would be okay
Don't say it was a good thing
Don't say it was the right thing to do
Don't say it was the best thing for the both of us
When I'm the one playing the fool

What do you want from me when I just want a restart?
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart

You've been lighting up my phone
Worried that I'll be alone tonight
Want to make sure that I'm fine
But baby you're not on my mind no more
I know it was the best thing for the both of us
Cause you're the one who looks like the fool

You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
What do you want from me when I just want a restart?
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
