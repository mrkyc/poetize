Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality

Back to life, back to reality
Back to the here and now, oh yeah
Show me how, decide what you want from me
Tell me maybe I could be there for you

However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me
However do you need me

Back to life, back to the present time
Back from a fantasy, yes
Tell me now, take the initiative
I'll leave it in your hands until you're ready

However do you want me

However do you want me (Hold me now, do you want me?)
However do you need me
However do you want me (However)
However do you need me, how
However do you want me
However do you need me

However do you need me
However do you need me
However do you need me
However do you need me

I live at the top of the block
No more room for trouble and fuss (No more room, no, no, no there's not)
Need a change (Oh), a positive change
Look, it's my writing on the wall (Oh, oh, however do you want me, oh)

However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me, how, how
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me (Oh)
However do you need me (Tell me now, how do you want me to be?)

Back to life, back to the day we had
Let's end this foolish game
Hear me out, don't let it waste away
Make up your mind so I know where I stand

However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me
However do you need me

However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me
However do you need me
However do you want me
However do you need me, how
However do you want me
