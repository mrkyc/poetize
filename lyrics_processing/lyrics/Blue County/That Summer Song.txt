An old truck pulled up with the windows down
That song from the past was playin' full blast
And all at once I was seventeen
And my car became a time machine
And all those years just disappeared
I could almost see my Janie beside me
Her bare feet up on the dash
And the boy I was, was stirred up inside me
Tuggin' my heart and takin' me back
Hey, yeah, yeah, that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Every night we danced 'till dawn
And listened to it over and over
Hey, yeah, that summer song
We learned about love as we went along
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on
In that summer song, that summer song
On the night of the day I got my first car
I grabbed my brand new keys
And my old guitar, I picked up my girl
Man, I owned the world

There it was again on my radio
Just in time
As her lips met mine
Oh well, I can't help wonderin' where Janie is now
Is she still stealin' hearts like she used to do?
Maybe she's somewhere listenin' somehow
Tuned in at this moment and feelin' it too
Hey, yeah, yeah, that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Every night we danced 'till dawn
And listened to it over and over
Hey, yeah, that summer song
We learned about love as we went along
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on in that summer song
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, that summer song
We cranked it up and sang out strong
Those glory days may be long gone
This feelin' still lives on in that summer song
