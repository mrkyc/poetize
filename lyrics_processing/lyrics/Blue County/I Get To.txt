Clip on tie, starch the shirt
I never heard the preacher's words
All slouched down in that pew
These days going to church is something I don't have to do
I get to
I used to have to hang with dad
Wash his car, and cut the grass
It took all day and I hated that
'Til his heart attack last June
These days helping dad is something I don't have to do
I get to
I, I get to
I get to wake up early
I get to go to work
I get to make an honest living to put my hands down in the dirt
I get hear grandma complain about all her little aches and pains
I get to rock my baby girl to sleep, spend my weekends coaching Little League
Theres a lot of things I don't have to do
I get to. Yes I do
I used to have to say those words
You always seemed to say them first
I dreamt one night you left this earth and I woke up and reached for you
Now I realize I don't have to say "I Love You."
I get to
Oh baby, I get to
You might also likeI get to wake up early
I get to go to work
I get to make an honest living to put my hands down in the dirt
I get hear grandma complain about all her little aches and pains
I get to rock my baby girl to sleep, spend my weekends coaching Little League
Theres a lot of things I don't have to do
Oh theres a lot of things I don't have to do
I get to
I, I get to
I get to wake up early
And I get to go to work
There's a lot of things I don't have to do
I get to
I get rock my baby, and I get to help my dad
Theres a lot of things I don't have to do
