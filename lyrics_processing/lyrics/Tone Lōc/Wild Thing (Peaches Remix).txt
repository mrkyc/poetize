Workin' all week, 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes, I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street, I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye, she got into the ride, went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said, "You're a liar"
I said, "I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire"
Took her to the hotel she said, "You're the king"
I said, "Be my queen if you know what I mean and let's do the wild thing"

Wild thing

At a co-ed sauna, sweatin' out the toxins
With outdoor booths and nakedness, I couldn't help my gawkin'
The steam began to rise, and so did little Ricky
He slid on over, touched himself, and told me he was sticky
I sprayed him down with water, his skin was all aglow
He flexed his 'ceps and arched the rest and claimed to be my hoe
I said, "Let's meet here weekly, and be my sauna fling,"
The hotter it gets, I get all wet and go crazy for the wild thing

Wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall, looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she cool rocked my world, and I had to adjust my fly
He said he liked to roleplay, I looked down and he looked up
He was on the floor, got on all fours and licked me like a pup
She looked at me and smiled and said, "You have plans for the night?"
I said, "Hopefully if things go well, I'll be with you tonight"
Then he acted Muhammad Ali, and said like a bee, he'd sting
He jumped all around and screamed real loud, "I'm the greatest at the wild thing"
Hey, hey

Wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing
Wild thing

W-w-w-wild

Wild thing
Wild thing
