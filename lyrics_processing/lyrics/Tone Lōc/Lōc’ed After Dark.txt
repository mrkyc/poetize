Allow me to display if I may
I'm ready to start (So am I) Well, okay
I've been held back for several years
I had a few squabbles, never shedded no tears
But like an Uzi on the mic they call me Tone Capone
Slayin' down with your posse if you're standin' alone
Cultivatin' all cities and tearin' up towns
I treat you like a king goin' for a rebound
When I'm on the mic, some say that I'm treacherous
They used to be the best, yeah, I bet you was
I never lost a battle, I ain't never been beat
Go look on the sharp tombstones on the street
Suckas like you try to diss with nerve
But I slay you down and lay you down next to the curb
Now I'm all in flesh, blindin' the one that stare
I drop you on the pavement, leave you parked in the rear
I don't need no protection, so here's a little lesson
When I leave the house, insured my Smith and Wesson
A .357, cold bobbin' off 11
It puts you in hell or it could place you up in heaven
You might also likeYou lookin' for trouble, then it's trouble I spark
But I'm tellin' you now, I get Loc'ed after dark

(Doin' it after dark)
(Doin' it at the park)
(Oh yeah, Loc gets hard)
(Oh yeah, that funk gets hard)

Freaks never cease, just to say the least
I'll start mobbin' motherfuckers like a savage beast
I'm takin' my turn to make the mic burn
And when I'm teachin' class, there's a lesson to be learned
Now I battle posses and tribes alike
Never battle out of hate, I always battle for spite
Cold jealous of me, the Westside man
The leader of the brothers, and killer of the Klan
But I don't give a shit 'cause my rhyme is legit
Cold put you in the yard and tie you up with my pit
'Cause when she starts to bite, that's when I will ignite
The views of the party taken to new heights
I consider myself to be a part of the elite
Suave and debonaire because the rhyme is so sweet
Been causin' confusion, magician of illusion
You got a little problem, here's a solution
A winner never quits and a quitter never wins
So why you just gamblin' with dubs and fiends?
Remember what I say, it sticks like Krazy Glue
I'm tellin' you now, I'm not afraid of you
Don't come in my face, I'll tear your heart apart
And like I told you before, (what?)
I get Loc'ed after dark

(Doin' it after dark)
(Doin' it at the park)
(Oh yeah, Loc gets hard)
(Oh yeah, that funk gets hard)
(Doin' it after dark)
(Doin' it at the park)
(Oh yeah, Loc gets hard)
(Oh yeah, that funk gets hard)

MC's comin' out like thunder
I'll make you see why Stevie had to Wonder
Is he fiction or is he a myth?
Naw, it's just a dope rapper, you know Tone Smith
'Cause every time you hear my song, your hands clap
The Chosen One puttin' LA on the map
With no objection I plead my case
Tone Loc, full capacity, leavin' outer space
The ace contender will never surrender
When I rock a show you always remember
The one and only, superior to many
Me losin' a battle? Naw, I can't remember any
Although, in the days, I may have lost one
Who the hell am I kiddin', I ain't been outdone
'Cause I'm the best, and I live out west
And if you want a dope song, I'll play your request
It don't take much to make a crowd live
Just some Bootsie, some George and a little bit of Sly
I step on stage and clear my hair
My next start, hmm, just a knock-up dare
No Uzi, my voice from the start
But you never know (Why?)
'Cause I get Loc'ed after dark

(Doin' it after dark)
(Doin' it at the park)
(Oh yeah, Loc gets hard)
(Oh yeah, that funk gets hard)
(Doin' it after dark)
(Doin' it at the park)
(Oh yeah, Loc gets hard)
(Oh yeah, that funk gets hard)

Yo Wop, wussup, why don't you do me a little favor, man
Why don't you scratch my back for me?
Oh yeah, little bit over to the left
A'ight, a'ight, move it up now
Yeah, now a little bit down
Now a little bit higher
Little bit over to the left, yeah
Li'l Wop's in the house
We outta here
Yes, hasta la negro
(Doin' it after dark)
(Doin' it at the park)
(Oh yeah, Loc gets hard)
