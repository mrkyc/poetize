Hello!
Guess who's in the house!
Can it be the L-O-C?
Comin' back at ya again, huh?
Got somebody on my back this time, ha
(I love you)
Ya ain't gon' believe it
Come on, girl: get away, get away!
(I want you)
I said baby!
What you doin', what you doin' to me?
(What are you so afraid of?)
You ain't gon' believe it, check this out:

I was straight on a date
To a girl to admire them movie
It was  the L-O-C and this sweet little girl named Susie
Now, me and the baby, we got  on the back of the car
It was wild and fun but when the meat was def I was straight 
I admit the catch was great
And I love  caressin'
But  wit Loc in a relationship, that's totally on the question
Now maybe it was less, was having just satisfaction
But I broke a heart, and that was the start of a
Fatal attraction

(Baby, baby baby)
Oh, yeah
Whatcha doin', girl?
Baby!
What you doin', what you doin' to me?
(I want you)
Can't have everything, you know?

Now, I swear I'm not lyin'
And this ain't no joke
But it seems Susie was daring to be Miss Loc
She was messed up in the head, I mean she didn't really understand
I knock the boots so so well, it was just a one night stand
She followed me everywhere, claimin' she was my lover
Called me up on the phone, sweatin' me harder than a grandmother
She was crazy like Crazy
Straight stuck on the satisfaction on lovin'  Locster
Like a (I'm not gonna be ignored!)
Fatal attraction

(Baby, baby baby)
But I'm not happenin' tho
(What are you so afraid of?)
Baby!
What you doin', what you doin' to me?
(I just wanna be a part of your life)
I can't take it no mo'
(I want you)
Get away, get away!
(I  you)
I know 
(I want you)
Get away, get away!
(I want you, baby)
(I need you, baby)
(I want you, baby)
(You hear me?)
(Do you hear me, baby?)

Now this girl went let up
And I was fed up with all this crap
So I brought another honey home for a little night cap
It was automatic, started goin' at it like newly wet
Then I saw this girl named Susie hidin' under my bed
She was yellin' and cussin', talkin' about how I runied her life
And she was aimin' to me to go on full speed with a  knife
(Ayyo man, Loc, what you do?)
One second I hesitated
Then I put on my draws, ran like hips so I wouldn't be castrated
She chased me outside, she slet into my pool
So I ran in the house, locked the door to protect my family jewels
I'm not glad but this was close, I escaped by a fraction
But I'm still  never  by
(I'm not gonna be ignored!)
Fatal attraction

(Baby, baby baby)
You know what I'm sayin'?
(I hate you)
Susie is a monster
 somebody help me!
I'm tired...
(I want you)
Get away, get away!
(...taste you!)
I know you can 
(I want you)
