It's the greatest little town in the world
Just tell them you're an old friend of mine
And every door in town will have a big welcome sign
So mention my name in Sheboygan
And if you ever get in a jam
Just mention name, I said mention my name
But please don't them where I am
While the teletypes are talkin' and the sirens roar
I'll be hoppin' on a freighter for a foreign shore
Mention my name in Paducah
It's the greatest little town in the world
I know a gal there you'll simply adore
She was Miss Paducah back in 1904
So mention my name in Paducah
And if you ever get in a mess
Just mention my name, I said mention my name
But please don't give them my address
While the teletypes are talkin' and the sirens roar
I'll be hoppin' on a freighter for a foreign shore
Mention my name in Elmira
It's the greatest little town in the world
I told the mayor there that he would go far
I even gave the sheriff an exploding cigar
So mention my name in Elmira
And if they try to put you in jail
Mention my name, I said mention my name
But please don't write to me for bail
While the teletypes are talkin' and the sirens roar
I'll be hoppin' on a freighter for a foreign shore

It's the greatest little town in the world
I know the big shots in the City Hall
They even got my picture on the post office wall
So mention my name in Tacoma
And if you ever get in a spat
Just mention my name, I said mention my name
But please don't tell them where I'm at
