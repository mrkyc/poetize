And I'm walking with a cane
Seek, seek you can be unique
But whatever you do don't let your inside out
But I've got to take a leap
And I know You're alive
And you know I will always try
I could never care less about
What this world has to offer if the price is to die
I'll keep my human spirit alive
Man I'm so weak
Come on over here I'll let you have a peek
Inside my heart cause you're the one I seek
I know I'm slow but wherever I go
I hear your steps echo
And I know You're alive
And I'll give my heart to survive
This world has nothing to offer a human soul
Reaching for the sky
So Father of light
Keep my human spirit alive
Will I try to hide away in the secret space of my heart
Will I try in time
Will I try with my feet on the ground
Shadows pull my hands towards the light
Will I try in time
You might also likeYour eyes
Are always there
Your eyes
Are what I came for
Your eyes
Drive away my fear
Your eyes
I could just stand there and adore
Stop just right there
Everything has to stop to steal time
For whom I want to be near
Yes I do care and I love the love we share
And I know You're alive
I'll give my heart to survive
This world has nothing to offer a human soul
Reaching for the sky
So Father of light
Keep this human spirit alive
Will I try to hide away in the secret space of my heart
Will I try in time
Will I try with my feet on the ground
Shadows pull my hands towards the light
Will I try in time
Seems there is nothing to remind me of peace down here
