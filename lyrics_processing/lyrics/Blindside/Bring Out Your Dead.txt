Heavy like a thousand pounds
What if I told you now
To carry the smell of death is
Harder than it sounds
Heavy like a thousand pounds
I bite my lips and look around
You said "My dear, it smells like corpse in here"

Bring out
Bring out your dead
Bring out
Bring out your dead
Bring out
Bring out your dead
Bring out
Bring out your dead

Pull out the speakers now
What comes out I will allow
I didn't come here to die
Dare to see what's inside
It feels like suicide
My favorite corpse I like to hide
You might also like
Who am I without
My skeleton friend?
Without the rules I bend
Can these broken bones mend?
Scared if I let it all out
You will know what I'm about
And the void, what do I fill it with
Once that corpse is gone

Bring out, bring out, bring out, bring out
Bring out
Bring out your dead
Bring out
Bring out your dead
Bring out
Bring out your dead
Bring out
Bring out what's dead
Bring out your dead

Pull out the speakers now
What comes out I will allow
I didn't come here to die
Dare to see what's inside
It feels like suicide
My favorite corpse I like to hide
When I let this corpse out
He will bite your soul
It will make you bleed
When I let this corpse go
Will you do the same
Will you let him go?
Let go

Pull out the speakers now
What comes out I will allow
I didn't come here to die
Dare to see what's inside
It feels like suicide
My favorite corpse I like to hide

When I let this corpse out
He will bite your soul
It will make you bleed
When I let this corpse go
Look me in the eye and let me
