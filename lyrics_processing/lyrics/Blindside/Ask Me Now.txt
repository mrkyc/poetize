Out of the forest towards my window with a smile in your hand
As the moist air up to your knees started swirling like smoke
I saw your lips move
Asking: Did you lose something?
I stood glued to the window
Emotions running through my vein
Now I know a word I can't explain
I think I've known you all along
Just lost your face in the crowd for awhile
I think I have been holding my breath all my life
Can I exhale and go into exile?
So ask me now and I'll run away with you
And so with the dawn you've come
Eye to eye
With nothing in between but this fragile glass
Your lips move again
I try but I can't detect the vibrations in the air
How I've longed to inhale your breath
I've still early and I see your words getting caught
In the window slowly turning into frost
I see your hand move and I can't detain
Scraping down a word I can't explain
You might also likeI think I've known you all along
Just lost your face in the crowd for awhile
I think I have been holding my breath all my life
Can I exhale and go into exile?
So ask me now and I'll run away with you
And so one morning just before dawn you've came
(Did you lose something?)
And so with the dawn you've come
(How I've longed to inhale)
I think I've known you all along
Just lost your face in the crowd for awhile
I think I have been holding my breath all my life
Can I exhale and go into exile?
So ask me now and I'll run away with you
I will
Ask me now and I'll run away with you
(Just lost your face in the crowd for awhile)
Ask me now and I'll run away with you
(Can I exhale and go into exile?)
