As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into givin' up
Coulda got the same rush from any lover's touch
Why get used to somethin' new? 'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

When you kiss me, yeah, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, will you come through? A happy second chance
Or happy ending, but this time, you don't leave me sinkin'

(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
I drain the fantasy of you, headfirst into shallow pools

And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry, happy second chance
I think I could forgive, but this time, you won't leave me sinkin'

(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

Dive back into (Right back into)
Dive right back into you and now I know you
Now I know you, now that I know you
Dive right back into you
Back into, right back into you
Dive right back into you and now I know you
Now I know you, now that I know you
Dive right back into you

(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in
(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in
I'll dive back in
