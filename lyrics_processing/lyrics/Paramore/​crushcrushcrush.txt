I got a lot to say to you
Yeah, I got a lot to say
I noticed your eyes are always glued to me
Keeping them here and it makes no sense at all

They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
(Two, three, four)

Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than
This
You might also like
If you wanna play it like a game
Well, come on, come on, let's play
'Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending
Than have to forget you for one whole minute

They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
(Two, three, four)

Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than
This now
Rock and roll, baby
Don't you know that we're all alone now?
I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, hey (Hey)
Don't you know, baby, we're all alone now?
I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, hey (Hey)
Don't you know, baby, we're all alone now?
Give me something to sing about

Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, no-ooh-oh
Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than

More than this
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
