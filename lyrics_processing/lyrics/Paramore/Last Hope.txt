I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
But the more I try to push it, I realize
Gotta let go of control

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Just let it happen

It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night, I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing is changed

But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
You might also like
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing (Ah)
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know is keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going (So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing (Ah)
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going (So if I keep my eyes closed with a blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing (Ah)

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, oh
