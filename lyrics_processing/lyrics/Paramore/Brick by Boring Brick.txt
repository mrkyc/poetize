She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
"It's all about the exposure
The lens," I told her
The angles were all wrong, now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle

Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da

So one day, he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve, well, make sure
To build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
And we'll bury the castle
Bury the castle

Woah
Woah
Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic
Well, if it's not real, you can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true, you can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah

Go get your shovel (You'll be better off without me now)
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel (You'll be better off without me now)
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle

Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-ba (Ba-ba-ba)
Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da
