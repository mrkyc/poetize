Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?

Where you're from, you might be the one who's runnin' things
Well, you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
See, it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? Mm, uh, uh
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you? Oh, uh
