Oh, you heard this before
And my punchline is poor, here's a funny twist
(Here's a funny twist)
I don't go out and roam
I prefer to be at home at a time like this
(At a time like this)
Since you walked out that door
I don't care anymore, girl, I barely exist

Ooh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you? (Oh no)
Ooh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?

People say not to worry
You'll be home in a hurry to comfort me
(Just to comfort me)
But it's not my composure
It's the sudden exposure that's worrying me

Ooh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you? (You lovely thing you)
Ooh baby, what else is there for me to do
But sit here and think about you?

You can check my willpower at this very hour
Girl, I think you'd find it was pretty low
I just sit here and brood and I really don't mean to be rude
But the truth? Girl, I think you'll find it so

Ooh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you? (Oh oh oh)

So you think I should date
And not anticipate your sweet return (Sweet return)
But I must follow my mind
And pretend to be blind where you're concerned

Ooh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
Ooh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
(Don't wanna talk to neighbors or hear from friends)
Ooh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
(Ain't gon' answer my phone, wanna be left alone)
