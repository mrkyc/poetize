(Seven rooms) I see a house, a house of stone
(Filled with gloom) A lonely house 'cause now you've gone
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness without your tenderness

You took the dream I had for us
Turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that never rings
I watch a door that never rings
Bring you back into my life, turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house, turn this house to a home

I need your touch to comfort me
Your tender, tender arms that once held me

(Seven rooms) Without your love, your love inside
(Filled with gloom) This house is just a place to run and hide
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) Rooms of emptiness without your tenderness

Don't make me live from day to day watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way, another reason for me to stay
I need you here, here with me, I need you, darling, desperately
I'm all alone, all alone in this house that's not a home

I miss your love I once had known
I miss your kiss that was my very, very own

(Seven rooms) Empty silence surrounding me
(Filled with gloom) Lonely walls, they stare at me
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is, rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness without your tenderness

All the windows are painted black and wait right here till you come back
I'll keep waiting, waiting till your face again I see

(Coming back)
