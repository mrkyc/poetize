One, two, three, four

Wakey wakey, rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall like dominoes
In pretty patterns
Fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling, tingling, tingling
It's what you feel not what you ought to
What you ought to
Reasonable and sensible

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But not, not, not
For no real reason

Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
I take a bow, take a bow, take a bow
It's what you feel not what you ought to
What you ought to
The elephant that's in the room
Is tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
In duplicate and triplicate and
Plastic bags
In duplicate and triplicate
You might also like
Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But not, not, not
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough, is enough?
I love you but enough is enough
Enough of that stuff
There's no real reason

You've got a head full of feathers
