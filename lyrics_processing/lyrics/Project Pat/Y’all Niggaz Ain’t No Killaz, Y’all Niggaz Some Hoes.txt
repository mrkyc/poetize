Yeah, this La Chat up in this motherfucker
Murder She Spoke will be out in a minute, ya heard me?
Now dig that
Project Pat up on this thang
Finna let you weak-ass, punk-ass, wanna be hard-ass
Want a real record deal-ass bitches know
Y'all motherfuckers ain't no killas
Y'all ain't nothin' but some motherfucking hoes
So keep ya mug off me when you see me
If you ain't finna do nothin', then keep your distance, boy

Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes

You can run, but you can't hide, I won't let you slide
Step with gun, get your mind right or a homicide
Shall be done TKO style, thug life is wild
On the run doing dumb shit, bastard of a child
Stand your ground, hold your own too, then still regulate
I'ma clown on a damn fool, slugs will penetrate
Through your skin, you got no wind when I gotta tone
I'm the man with master plan, you can bring it on
What I said to his ho ass right up in his mug
With this thang, bitch, I will blast, coughin' up your blood
'Cause you came to a real man thinking I's a boy
When it rains thick, it does pour, I'm the real McCoy
Done deal, pullin' out steel, bitches play for games
You's a two dollar-ass boy and I'm making change
Take heed to these motherfuckin' words that I say
Don't play with real niggas, real niggas don't play

Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes
Y'all niggas ain't no killas, y'all niggas some hoes

A real nigga work a job 'fore he fall off
Or pull one with a mask or a sawed-off
A real nigga don't speak what he don't know
And keep his mouth shut, act like he don't know
A real nigga will kill if he have to
Take care of his kids any way that he got to
A real nigga never start shit, he end shit
And mastermind shit and execute shit

So don't you hoes try to test me
Best to bow down and bless me
The police want to arrest me
I won't get caught
Some want to annihilate me
Some of y'all really hate me
Here I go, bitch, try to take me
