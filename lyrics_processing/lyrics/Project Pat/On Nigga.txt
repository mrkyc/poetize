Fuck you nigga, I'll see you boy

As a youngsta guns-ah, what I specialize in
Me and my dawgs selling dope on a rising
Rising in years we together in this hood life
Struggling together, straight praying for the good life
Yo life means more to me than my own do
When you had some beef I went and shot on that whole crew
I do what I gotta do, 'cause I'm yo right hand
You's a lot older than me, I'm yo little man
Mane time fly's now we old to older
You done came up flippin' pebbles to boulders
Told ya that I'm down with you until the graveyard
Me and you got caught with some work in the same car
You were facing more time than me if behind bars
I was seventeen and a half so I took the charge
You got larger heard now you own a crack house
I did two years and they let a nigga back out

Back out on the town and you riding in the Jag clean
Hit me with a pound, then bought me a Chevy thang
I could've sang and flew like the canary
You know I got heart and I know you very scary
Carrying a lot of weight, put in plenty work
Always was down for ya dawg, did plenty dirt
Looking like a jerk and ya living like a kingpin
That ain't showing love, I'm about to stick this tone
Inside ya fucking face, blow ya brains to the other side
38 dumb dumbs cut like a butter knife
But inside the walls you be soaking up game quick
Fuck that guerilla shit trick, I done got slick
Remember ya kept ya dope backyard dawg house
Over there on Dunlap, North Memphis mama house
Looking for the cross that will come up from behind ya
Muthafuck the laws, 'cause I'm taking what's mine-ah

Mom's went to church so I'm jumping over gate fast
You mane was outta town handling business
Blew both Rottweilers out they misery
You got a fist in good so they couldn't see
Yea, it's kind of obvious what I came for
Heroin and that white-dust ain't no shame boy
A real robber robs a trick and don't say a word
Got 'em for a pound of heroin and 'bout eight birds
Mouth slurred, 'cause a nigga blowing on some good shit
Celebrating, 'cause a playa done made a fat lick
Any trick do this to me hollow points fly
Dead in the face right between muthafuckas eye
I be's the nigga busting if we in a brawl
