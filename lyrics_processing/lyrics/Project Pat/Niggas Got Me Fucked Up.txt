These niggas got me fucked up
I'm down for my crown, mane
If I go out, I go out on yo' ass, mane
Lame ass niggas startin' shit
Like some bastards
When I catch ya mark ass slippin', I'm a blast ya
Half of ya fools get high before a drive-by
I don't need a joint, to let me know
That a ho can die
Through the eye
Blast of the elevated scope-ah
Pull the trigger back
Watch the bullets smack his throat-ah
Niggas startin' shit, is a nigga who's a coward
Only startin' shit
'Cuz he think, he got some power
Shower yo' ass, with a full clip of hollow points
When I start to blast, bitch
I bet, yo' ass will get the point
Point me a tone right dead at ya dome, fool
"Damn, he from the hood!"
Fuck that, ain't nobody cool!
Foolish-ass, jealous-ass niggas know, they ain't down, you done met yo' match, bitch
And the Patsta's gonna' clown

Now, everybody wanna play the hard role
Talkin' bout a bitch, their money, and a bankroll
I know that if a fool steps to Patsta, I'll serve ya
I'll be downtown for yo' goddamn murder
Jerk a nigga by his collar, pistol to his head
When I pull the trigger, bet a dollar that the trick's dead
Dead on arrival wit' his weak boy at the club
Trying to fuck wit' Pat, and his back head caught a slug
.38 Caliber however at close range:
Yeah, it's very, very fatal, mane, to a nigga's brain
Train everyday, I'm a mothafuckin' soldier
When you come up missin', mothafucka, I done told ya
Hold ya nuts up, go and get ya pop gun
You must be a fool if you think a nigga's gonna run
From yo' ass, I'm a pull the gat back 'til you struck
Niggas should've known dog, Project Pat don't give a fuck
