Bald-head skally-wag, ain't got no hair in the back
Gelled up weaved up, yo hair is messed up
Need to get bout a hustle mission
Get up on loot run to beautician
Run game until the game is gravy
That don't mean spend cheese fo tha baby
(Bwok bwok) on a stalk stalk for a bootleg
(Bwok bwok) pretty walk walk givin out head
Ain't a thang eat a chicken wang
Got some gold teeth, at the club tryna shake that thang
Tryna get a piece, chicken chicken always into some dumb shit
Shoulda paid ya light bill, you bought a outfit
Stay at ya mammy house and keep a smart mouth
It's Project Pat, Memphis Tenn represent the South
So pass tha dro-dro and we gone stay kickin'
Full of that mo'-mo' holla at a chicken

Yeah you like my outfit, don't even fake the deal
I thought you said you had your girl on the light bill
Always in my face talkin this and that
Girl I had to buy some rims for da Cadillac
You riding clean but ya gas tank is on E
Be steppin out ain't got no decent shoes on ya feet
That's just the meter broken youn't know'cha talkin bout
Anywaym them new Jordans finna come out
Hate see you in a club, ya mobbin wit a mug
Knowin that you ridin wit ya boy, ya nothin but a scrub
But he was with me, that's when you hated
'Cause when I got up on ya friend, ya damn-near fainted
I sho did in our face drinkin' on that "yak"
Mouth fulla golds but yo ass need some Tic-Tacs
What? You need some gum, breath like some thunder
What you lookin' at? I don't want your phone number

Now these chickenhead hoes see this platinum think it's white gold
See them 20 inch Pirellis roll mane thank the vogues
Dodgin all my foes ridin Caddy trucks wit DVD's
A flock of broads followed me from the club to break they knees
Knowin that's all I want straight out the club
The rest ain't smellin right, the last thang on they mind is freshin up
It's goin down tonight, weave in they head
Weed in they purse, still crunk
Baby seats all across the back, with clothes in the trunk

I been known to hold my own, I been known to ride on chrome
I been known to flip a platinum watch wit the diamond stones
I'm the fool supplyin tha dro, I'm the fool supplyin tha blow
I'm the playa who got you chickenheads knockin at my do'
Tellin me that you diggin me, tellin me I'm yo man to be
Girlfriend it's gone cost a fee, get yo ass and work the streets
Pay ya boy and make me rich so we keep them Swishers lit
Pay yo fees we count them G's, cashin it from all you chicks
