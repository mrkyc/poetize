Man, Project Pat in the house
This go out to all the real niggas out there havin' money
Ghetty green, that cheese, that feddi, that loot
Better watch your back man
'Cause your friends out to get you for your shit
This is to all these niggas crossin' us here
Smile in your motherfuckin' face
Turn around and stab you in your motherfuckin' back
In a motherfuckin' heartbeat
If I ever catch one of you niggas man
That's a motherfuckin' murder off the top, boy
Fo' sho', nigga

Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means

I'm the man wit' the plan, wit' the gaze, wit' the mask
Steppin' up to ya fast, layin' you in the grass
All your blood, ain't no love, on the street wit' no police
Everybody is a rat, everybody's 'bout the greens
You know me, I know you, we grew up in the pen
But it wasn't face to face, you was out, I was in
Doin' time off a crime I committed in the past
I'mma O.G. on the town, as a O.G. I'mma last
In the past I was known as that nigga who would snap
I was quick to bill a cap, but it had to be a jack-
Type move, real cool, yeah that's how he thought we was
Use ta kick it every day, smokin' out on that bud
That's my dog, that's my nig', that's a bad young brotha
I just got out the pen, I'mma broke-lookin' sucka
Man, fuck that young busta, eighty grand at his house
Seen his momma at the store, stuck a nine in her mouth (in her mouth)

Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means

Mastermind, that's the kind of a man that's in my nature
I'mma nigga you don't trust, I'mma killer, maybe raper
I can take a person's life with a knife or a tone
Used his moms as my victim, then I called him on the phone
What's up John, where the green, and I ain't gon' ask you twice
Bring it over by yourself, or I'll take your momma's life
In the life of a dealer they can never call police
Undercover knowin' this, secrecy, that's the key
One two three knocks at the door, somethin's lookin' funny
Then my dog let I'm in with his friend and the money
You's a dummy if you think I'mma let you live, sucka
(Aw man, thought we was straight), you's a dead motherfucker
Shot the joker in his mouth, bullet went through his jaw
Had to take his momma out, 'cause I'm down for the cause
Fuck the laws if they come, then I'm goin' wit' a blast
Looked his partner in his eyes, then I murdered his ass
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means
Ghetty green, ghetty green, I gotta get the green
Ghetty green, ghetty green and that's by any means

I'm the man doin' deals wit' the man gettin' robbed
It's gon' be a violent crime, one that will not get solved
When I rob me a fool, it's a duh that his bitch
Front like I'm sellin' ki's, then I'm game for the switch
Switcharoo on your ass, duffle bag full of cash
Then my thugs pullin' up cockin' pumps in the masks
Hit the dash in the black tinted Chevy, trick it in
Now we on the 'spressway, brought it down, tell my friend
Once again I done pulled off another master plan
Four days downtown found a Chevy wit' a man
Dead body, somebody shoulda known betta, dog
O.G.'s on the loose and we gettin' 'bout our hog
Y'all niggas slangin' dope should expect a jackin'
Car jack set up, bitch or a damn kidnappin'
But a nigga like me, I'm your neighborhood fiend
