Out here slangin' on this blade prayin' that I don't get cut
By these police makin' raids, jumpin' out and checkin' nuts
Cuttin' balls down to crumbs, babbage weed is in my lungs
Nigga stick me for a bag, I'mma shoot him in his ass
I'mma show 'em who the boss, when you niggas gonna learn?
When you cross in this game, then yo ass will get burned
Wait my turn, or my time rock for rock, for the dime
Takin' Fed chance after chance, but I got to dance
To the rules of this shit, that's why I keep a revolver
How the hell you robbers gonna rob the robber?
Boy I'm gonna start ya with pistol slapped cross mouth
Reachin' in ya pockets, and take yo money out
Mane you now whats goin', you got cheese, I got dope
For da nine-hunnid strong, I got P's, I got coke
Ain't no credit givin' mane, you could get from 'round here
Niggas robbin', niggas bangin', niggas slangin' down here

I got cheese, hoes, and a bunch of fuckin' dope
I got P's, coke, and some killas at the do'
Hydro weed smoke, and a quarter ounce of blow
What you need bro, is to fuck wit' yo boy

Quarter bird, what's the word? For you dog, it's da low (North Memphis)
Sellin' me babbage weed but you want the purest snow (North Memphis)
I'ma go, I'mma pull, me a rabbit out a hat (North Memphis)
Ounce of cane mixed with sugar and some killas strapped wit' gats (North Memphis)
Always tryin' to be slick, you done stepped in some shit (North Memphis)
You done broke ghetto laws, you done tore ya fuckin' drawers (North Memphis)
Wit' me boy, yeain't know, 'cause the streets never lies (North Memphis)
Walk right up on yo ass, shoot right between the eyes (North Memphis)
You be stankin' with the flies while I'm ridin' on chrome (North Memphis)
Wit' yo bitch, smokin' dro, fucking all in yo home (North Memphis)
While ya kissin' on her lips, she'll be suckin' on my dick (North Memphis)
Flippy flop on the paint, system booms as I dip (North Memphis)
Through the streets of the hood, North Memphis Hollywood (North Memphis)
Represent it to the max, I'm just out here statin' facts (North Memphis)
Tryin' to stack me some pape's, got my foot on you snakes (North Memphis)
I'm gon squeeze off some lead for you niggas that are fake (North Memphis)

You could duck from the TEC out tha Escalade
Once I get my cheese on a roll, then I must get paid
If you want to come against me dawg, bring your whole brigade
But you shall get sliced like a throat with a swisher blade
Sippin' on some Paul-ay Masson, like some sweet Kool-aid
Strapped with me an automatic gun, don't you violate
Nigga said "He'll snitch on me dawg", I didn't hesitate
Caught him in the Projects one day, sent him to his grave
Playaz wanna come through the hood, but forgot the fear
Knowing it ain't all to the good, you could get it here
Wrong place, at the wrong time, call it Slipper's Gold
Dope fiends keep me up with them and my pockets swole
Eyes red as hell, 'cause I ain't had a lick of sleep
Snorted a quarter ball, so that I could stay on my feet
Treat any bitch just the same as a nigga too
If you trustin' hoes in this game, you's a damn fool, boy
I got cheese, hoes, and a bunch of fuckin' dope
I got P's, coke, and some killas at the do'
Hydro weed smoke, and a quarter ounce of blow
