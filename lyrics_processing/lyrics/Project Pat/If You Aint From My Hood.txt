If-I don't know (If)
I don't know

If you ain't from my hood, you can get from 'round here
If you ain't from my hood, you can get from 'round here
If you ain't from my hood, you can get from 'round here
If you ain't from my hood, you can get from 'round here
I don't know them niggas, I don't fuck with them niggas
I don't know them hoes, I don't fuck with them hoes
I don't know them niggas, I don't fuck with them niggas
I don't know them hoes, I don't fuck with them hoes

I know this sucka from the suburbs
Cool with this other mothafucka on the outskirts
Tried to get Project Pat caught up in the sh-izz-irt
Since you niggas hate, then your plan didn't w-izz-ork
All in ATL, tattletale to my b-izz-urd
Say you saw me with another gal, nah, don't be scared
Mane, you might as well throw in your towel, you's a fake thug
Face to face, I shoot you in your mouth, 'cause ain't no love
Say you from the North Memphis Tenn, but I doubt that
Stick our nose in others folks affairs, we ain't 'bout that
Weak mothafucka wanna stare when you see me
Couldn't wait to snitch, punk bitch, you wanna be me
Got to pay some dues, but my shoes too big for ya
Don't be out here tryin' to claim my hood, I don't know ya
Turn state witness ask if you was a roller
Police ass nigga, watch your mouth, I done told ya
Weak ass boy!

Still out to get paid, down for Lucha Libre
Fuck all the bullshit, and he say, she say
Those who oppose me, shall get no leeway
Lyin' on real niggas end up in gun play
Punk mothafucka, you gonna hear this, and feel me
Smile in my face, really wanna kill me
That's if you had heart to pull the trigger
Catch a murder charge? I don't think so, my nigga
Weak ass hoes play games like they killers
Always runnin' mouth, braggin' on they niggas
Cypress Garden, I did not have no dough
No fresh clothes, 'cause a playa was real poor
I was locked up, 201 wearin' bobo's
Playin' dominos, shootin' dice, big ol' afro
Now, I'm on the town, and I'm layin' the smack down
Nigga, I ain't you, best to check my background

Mane, I'm tired of playin' with you boys
Think it's time I kill you boys
Wanna run and grab them toys
You fuckin' 'round with real McCoys
Cowboys, they bring the noise
Rollin' round in SUV's, DVD's
Sayin' "fuck some 20's, I'm lowkey!"
Lookin' for y'all cowards
'Cause y'all talkin' out the side of your mouth
Knowin' that the Triple 6 is one of the hardest out the South
DJ Paul and Juicy J, best producers in the town
I've been got that crown, those who ain't down get runned down!
(Yeah, better believe that)
(Nigga, y'all nigga, J)
(Know what I'm sayin', nigga?)
(Yeah)
Mane, if one of you bitches wanna step up to the juice
Talkin' 'bout that nigga wrong
Talkin' 'bout what you gon' do
Mane, its on if you rappers wanna bring it to the door
To you crosses in my click, I'mma treat you like a ho
I'mma tell you like this:
If you talkin' in my face, you gon' start a major war
Be prepared to hit the floor
Every time you see me comin', you be speakin' like we cool
I ain't your mothafuckin' nigga, and I ain't no mothafuckin' fool!

I ain't stupid at all, nigga
I know you thinkin' you real, you know what I'm sayin', nigga?
Whatever, whatever y'all niggas want to do, nigga
This shit real
I keep tellin' you mothafuckas don't salt shake me
You know what I'm sayin', nigga?
