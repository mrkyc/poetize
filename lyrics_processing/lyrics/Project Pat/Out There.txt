Hey pass me a beer man
Here you go
Man that nigga been standing there on the same goddamn spot
Slagin' that shit for about the last 4-5 days man
With the same clothes on, ain't even been home yet
I don't even think so I wonder if he smoking or selling
That shit he had to be smoking or snortin' something
To be up for them 4-5 days
Naw, I heard he shot somebody man
For real?
That's the reason why he probably can't go home
Yeah, you know like what you call been missing too man
I think that's the nigga, he suppose to be frontin' his money to
That's why the police been drivin' around so hard
Yeah, burning the spot up man, yeah
Yeah, we might need to gone call 528-CASH on that nigga ass
And turn him on in
We need to man to make that little change man
Get some mo' beers or something
Yeah, we gone do that
Need to hurry up and gone, turn that nigga ass in man make
This neighborhood probably a little bit safer man
A little bit more
At least for us or something dang

Where I'm from mane, ain't no sunshine gonna shine
On a dog's ass if his ass don't get on a grind
Doing time helped a nigga out, to clear up my head
Used to have a shank in the light, that was by my bed
It was said, I would end up dead, working in the street
But the street is the only thing I see paying me
Quarter-ki, fuck servin' deals, rockin' to the shake
Slanging guns, slanging T.V.'s mane I'm tryna' make
All I can my nigga, French ho Poncho at a ho's house
Get her drunk, take her to the back, put dick in her mouth
Leave the front door unlocked, my nig turn the radio
Pulled the car up into the yard, cleaning out the ho
You should know that a burglary, really ain't for me
I just got out the 'tentiary, tryna' get on my feet
Get the cheese, off the merchandise, went and bought a deal
Nigga please, you say you don't steal, I'mma keep it real

Haters like to get a playa twisted in that bullshitta
A game-spitter, I'm also a wig-splitter
Yo' ass getta, shot up by the nine milla
Your cap I drilla, when fuckin' with a real nigga
The chrome trigga' should regulate a punk quicker
The bullet hit ya', I'm zoned off that brown liquor
You need to get ya' nose out a nigga's biz
Quit spreading rumors like a motherfuckin' punk bitch
My trunk is the bed for a kidnap victim
Hollowpoint hit him, pull out my gun your hands you get them
Up in the airra because you came to me in error
Don't want to scare ya', say you a man then face the terror
I know these bullets will pop ya' shit off like a melon
Let's bust it up, bad as fuck, man who you tellin'
It's armageddon, in North Memphis crack we sellin'
You pass me that purple weed, is what they yellin'

Blunt to my lips, gun on my hip
Rocks in my sock, pocket full of chips
