She got a bubble gum cap with a coochie dats snappin'
With some rhino legs and a booty that's flappin'
With some fire old head cuz you know we love cappin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Here dat big ol' butt that you're walkin' cross the street with
Peep this, for a happy meal can I squeeze it
Till it go pop, make the juice start to runnin' out
Greasy lips, thick like a moose what I'm talkin' 'bout
Them freaky freaks I heard on the loose, let ya pockets out
Got trick niggas watchin' your caboose with they wallets out
You should stop, lil' somethin' somethin' bad to the bone
That ain't a monkey hangin' off ya back, that's Donkey Kong

How you gon' bounce around with all that, sayin' you ain't all that
Everybody at ya wanna hit ya like a ball bat
That thang make ya look back, be like mane who is that
You can set a heinie on a heinie, I'm pursuin' that
A dirty south hoody rat tryin' to hold goodies back
Waist like a wasp, butt cheeks pokin' really fat
I'm Crown Vic old school, squeezin' on her boo-boo
Hugged up, pokin' in her brains so what ya wanna do
Nice tats on ya body, liquor comin' out ya pores
Weed stench ya ain't right, G-string for some drawers
You can call me Mr. Whipple, I won't do no harmin'
Never to the Charmin, come holla at me woman

Im a P-I-M-P with diamonds all in my teeth
I step in the light man, my mouth be shiny
A ghetto star in the street, the choppin' and cuttin' the keys
They all wanna get with me, these girls be beggin' please
They call me the Juice Man, I love a striptease
A girl with a lot of ass, that's down to hit her knees

Yeah, I beat that thang like it stole somethin' never let her hold somethin'
Put the staff in her mouth, claimin' that she owe somethin'
Show 'em somethin' mean on the scene
When I first seen them jeans, teamed with that booty it's a dream team
Make it go-go up and down like a yo-yo
But I had to pop her blue cuz I'm on that Tonio Montana
