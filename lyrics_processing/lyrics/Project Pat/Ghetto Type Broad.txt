She's a freaky young gal, a bi-sexual
But a hustler though and will sell some snow
Wit dat' juicy fat thang I can't let you go
What she doing mane wit' all that I bet you know?
Baby girl take dem trips down to Mexico
Get dem birds and dat herbs and will see her doe
Clock ticks like her brain when she sceme a plot
Set playas up for change and receive alot
My thang staying on hard, make that coochie pop
Suck me up 'til she get the last goosy drop
The shake club never had much to offer her
A dyke broad get none, 'cause it's boss wit' her
And it's boss wit' me why you be asking when twerking
She don't claim pimp but she'll have ya' working
Aw, it's for certain she been there and did dat'
Could be corporate lawyer or a hood rat

She's a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
Catching me wit' the dope and she'll take the charge
She's a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
Catching me wit' the dope and she'll take the charge
She's a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
Catching me wit' the dope and she'll take the charge
She's a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
Catching me wit' the dope and she'll take the charge

Razor blade in ya mouth green stuff in ya' stuff
Philly blunts in ya' purse but that ain't enough
Turning liquor bottles up wit' cha' mane as we dip
Turn right turn left each corner take a sip
Say wassup to the big pussy click in Hine Park
Learna and Leonara and those who got hard
Staying down wit' your dogs till they let your dogs go
Jailhouse like a dog house dog y'ain't know
Everbody need somebody real on their team
No letters, no visitation make you mean
Make you wanna think everybody left you for dead
And ya' gal dat' you love out there giving head
What the past don't be thinking 'bout the things that I did
I need money for some commissary can ya' dig
Taking chances with us so we can live
Put some rims on the car, shoes for the kids
