Man, why these niggas always hatin' on Hypnotize and Cash Money?
Man, fuck these niggas, man!
What's up, whoadie?
It's these gold grill and these platinum-mouth boys
These big time Hot Boys, these Three-6 boys
Wit the self made millionaire Cash Money boys

You done fucked with the wrong nigga
Must ain't know that I ride and I shoot quicker
Should have known not to upset this lil' nigga
You got a clique? So what, nigga, my clique thicker
A bunch of real ass niggas that'll burn ya up
With no waitin', catch ya slippin' then jam ya up
Slangin' weight ain't no thang for me
Play by the rules
Or shit, I'll kill your family, that's what I do
Bust your chest wide open and split your fade, nigga
And them all frozen, moves from the 'K, nigga
Turk don't play, when it's time to get serious
Think I'm a ho, keep it that way and stay curious

Niggas be shoutin' "one love" but wearin' black gloves
Some niggas 26 and 28 still live in they mom house askin' for play
Them niggas shouldn't be respected, they fake
Instead of hittin' blocks with Glocks and touchin' niggas money spot
And breakin' bread with the woman who put 'em in that spot
These niggas wanna trick to these hoes and play with they nose
Instead of totin' fo'-fo's and movin' fuckin' kilos
Nigga, I done bought more cars than niggas done bought pussy hoes
And bought more rims than niggas done fucked they main ho in they assholes
Three 6 told me to roll and unload
But nigga fuck that
I'm tryin' to stack and mack
And that deal with Universal shoulda showed that
But Uptown is where it's at
Playboy, won't you tell me how you love that?
Won't you tell me how you love that?

Fuckin' with Three 6 Mafia gon' make me millions
Fuckin' with CMR gon' make me some more millions
I can see it, I'm a kill 'em, and build me and building
And put some money to the side for my mom and my children
Ridin' with my nigga Rambezee, to the easy
Drinkin' for my nigga Babyzee and B.G.eezy
Ducked off
Tinted windows on my candy apple Cut dawg
It's a classic, nigga, fuck y'all

I'm representin' Northern Memphis to the fuckin' fullest
We ain't the kind to tote a gun when there ain't no bullets
And when that drama starts to stir, we ain't scared to pull it
You see a nigga holdin' gauge and you wish he would have
Rolled by your mama house and put her in a coma
'Cause niggas gone on that Hennessy and marijuana
And now we back up in the hood on a burner phone-a
In that game slangin' 'caine to you blood donors
It's on, coward
They call me quick draw 2 pistols Lil Wayne
Champagne took my brain, I don't think I just aim
Drop tops on a Z-3, start shootin' like 3 burners
How come them try me? Never know me block burner
Better watch for lil' shorty in black, nigga, get back
'Bout to make my Glock 40 click clack
Brrr kill it
It's your life, spill It
Playin' with the realest
Block fire like a skillet
Now nigga, what the dilly?
Highly influenced on Cristal
I'm warnin' you to clear the set because it gets wild
I be disguised as a mailman with a pistol
Then deliver him 50 shots and take his child
What what

Punk bitch I dare ya
I double dare ya step against this pot belly
Bitches they try to step to the ruler but they ain't ready
Quick as them cowards try to make moves, oughta knock 'em out
Second one step, y'all need more help, two barrels in his mouth
Face it, when this shit's fucked up you gotta deal with it
This is my game, live with it or get killed with it
These are my dice, this is my board, I let you roll off
And how you gon' have ice when I cut your fuckin' water off?

It's the Project, nigga, roll back, I own the bricks
Kickin' game with the Hot Boys and Three 6
B.G., Juvenile, Baby, Lil Wayne
North Memphis, Uptown, and we havin' thangs
AIn't no thang, when ya come real ya gotta shine
I'm strapped with a Glock 9, he ain't takin' mine
We in our prime puttin' in work players never rush it
Full of gin, fucking hoes like a mad Russian
A discussion amongst men means a power move
Is about to be made for a come-up, fool
Slang that iron when you get in my business
Hypnotize, Cash Money, on the rise bitch
