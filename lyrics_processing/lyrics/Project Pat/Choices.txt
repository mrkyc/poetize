If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which one you prefer to be right

Another day means another way I can get some pay
Skies are gray, but they turning blue for a player true
To the game all aboard the train those who kept it real
Couldn't hang, I'm a holler man, this one you feel
Well I feel choices I made ways to get paid
If I lay down on my back then I won't get jacked
Project Pat never fake the deal, all about a meal
Keep a strap for the wolf pack out here trying to steal
'Cause I still think some of y'all wanna see my fall
But I ball, that's in any weather, can we stick together
All is one but I know it's some, always wanna preach
That I'm wrong, 'cause I rap a song lyrically I reach
To the youth and I'm getting paid and I'm out the slum
Legally ghetto fabulous, player give me some
Count my props, 'cause I never stop trying to get laid
Feeling good, stacking dollar bills, choices I made

If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which one you prefer to be right
You might also like
Here I go with a steady flow, finally at last
On the bricks, not behind bars, 'cause back in the past
Had no cash and I had no car so I had to do
Anything just to maintain sipping on the brew
Not a fool, keeping hazards down to a minimum
Staying cool, down with my hood Memphis Hollywood
Understood everybody can't play the same role
Make a choice, do it legally or you slang dope
But I hope that the choice made is the one for you
Have a clue, gotta learn yourself, hustle to your death
Making wealth with a pad and pen walking out the pin
Making steps to be right on top of my game again
See my friend you the master of your destiny
It can be what you want it to, man it's all on you
Player who wanna blow a dub, ease on the brain
Ain't no pain, just a lot of love, Curtis do yo thang

If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose my brothers
If there was no day or night
