Man let me hit that weed dog
Man that shit some dro
Man that was fucked up what happened to tha boy tha other day
Man u know how these niggas do
Violate real playaz and end up
On the motherfucking front page of the newspaper
Fuck that sucker thats what he gets
For running his motherfucking mouth (bitch)

Real playaz like to smoke a (whole lotta weed)
Drinkin' bottles of that liquor (all that we need)
This 9mm (will make you bleed)
I advise you niggas (don't fuck wit me)

Real playaz like to smoke a stroke her off in her throata
Bend over, let me poke her, roll up on some old dopea
Don't take me fo a joka, hollows will make ya croaka
My hands around your throat, grip grip tight like a choka'
Hate hate me fo no reason, beat beat yo like a peon
Pumpkinhead whatchu getta, it must be killin' season
For some droppas and suckas, coward ass mothufuckas
Poppin' off at that cappa, could get you killed like othas
Maybe it's not yo time, maybe it could be mine
Then put me in a box and bury me wit' my nine-a
Forty-Fo and my shotty, hatas up in this sorry
Wishin' they put tha bullets up in my body
But that's if I'm a gonna, for now smell the aroma
Of brown cold liquor and potent marijuana
Project Pat in this bitcha, tryin' mayne to get richa
The first hit off this dope is gonna hit ya

Stay down about cho gama, fame-a I never claim-a
A monkey's on my face for those who are a stranga
Strange, 'cause I do not know ya, chip chip up on my shoulda
I'm knockin out yo teeths, fists hard just like a boulder
I'm creepin' in the Nova somewhere out in Cordova
A nigga done got bolder, his life is gon' be ova
Grey tape with clip bandana I kidnap I can handle
He came to me with Anna, he should of mind his manners
I hit him with the TEC-a, damn near tore off his necka
He prayin' I'm gon squash him, he shoulda prayed to Mecca
You hataz like to tick me, squeeze triggaz 'till I'm empty
This weed turned me out, I damn near let it bit me
I'm stealin' to get higher, smokin' nothin' but fire
(Damn that was my last blunt dog)
Nigga you's a liar
So cuz you tryin' to screw me, I told them man don't do me
I'm drinkin' on this brewsky, this shit is goin' through me
Whole lotta whole lotta whole lotta
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Out the pen once again, it's yo dog stackin' ends
Makin cheese, fuckin' hoes, knockin' ducks off they toes
Up the nose goes the white, pimpin hoes, take a flight
Like a kite, like a plane, my nigga I'm the man
Mista don't take no shit, Mista well take yo bitch
Ten toes 'bout the biz, cowards can not handle these
Scandalous paranoid, 'bout to bust on my boys
Check niggas fo they grip, pistols swing, busted lip
Busted chops that's yo ass, punk bitch where's the cash
Money green cheddar cheese, all bitches hit they knees
Serve 'em up ready rock, distribute it on the track
Always keep me a Glock, place it up to your back
Fat sacks I'm smoking' on, Mack man wit' a tone
P-A-T 'bout the loot, ridin' by then I shoot
Who's to say cheefin' hay, hustlin' to get pay
