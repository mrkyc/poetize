As I slip into the back of my mind
And thinkin' of gettin' caught, man, how could I do the time?
The crime is a murder, heard ya fuckin' with, my nig
The magnum's gonna serve ya, bitch, I'm finna split your wig
I figure out ways to get lose without a trace
You see without a pistol, man, they do not have a case
Erasin' a fool, wait until he leave the house
Walkin' around his corner, ride-by takin' him out
The box on the blocks, police ride up on the scene
Witnesses saw the shots, and I know they heard a scream
Redeem me the testimonies would not even last
In court because everybody they saw wore a mask
The blast from the gun was the hollow point tips
The kind that leave you dead in a damn perfect hit
I trips off a fool tryin' me on the for real-uh
He's fuckin' with a pistol packin', bitch smackin' killa

As I ride through the hood with some undisputed niggas
Pain sellin', dope smokin', cold-blooded killers
Trigger, my nigga from the north Frayser area
Down with the Patster, causin' mass hysteria
Wherever scoped out, best believe we loced out
Ridin' through the other side, ready to take a punk out
Assed out sucker type, you gon' learn your lesson
Haven't see your gangsta friends shootin' Smith and Wessons
Testin' the clan, just to see if you can get enough
You's a foolish man, I'll be damned if we don't fuck you up
So what's up with your posse with your fuckin' game, punk?
Fuckin' with these hitmen, you gonna get your ass dumped
Pop the trunk, get your pump, let's see what you made of
Watch me kill a bitch with a .38 bullet slug
Sell your drugs, I don't care if you a dope dealer
Best pack a pistol, bitch, 'cause I'm a killer

You say I need to take care my business
Well why are you pussy-eatin' mothafucks in it?
You about to witness a mafia called Triple 6
Real niggas that don't fall out over bullshit
I'm tired of these mothafuckas thinkin' I'm a jokester
Let me ride up on ya with the Tec and I'ma show ya
You don't know me, well, punk bitch, nigga, bring it on
Niggas don't fight no more, young niggas carry tones
I tried to be down at first, now, I'm just another Devil
Walkin' with a psychotic mind, and a piece of metal
