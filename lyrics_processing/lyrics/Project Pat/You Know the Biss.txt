Mane, a nigga smoked out on that light-light
Mane, I need to put some pimpin' in this thang, some pimpin'

Mane, you know the business
Mane, you know the business
Playa gonna shine. trick

Still a mack, still a thug
Still a mane showin' love
To my dawgs, to my folks
Violators, feel these slugs
In ya back, ratta-tat
It's your dawg Project Pat
In the hood havin' fun
Sippin' on Paul Masson
Give me some, show me love
Like the man up above
Watch me rise to the top
Spread my wings like a dove
Mean mug, niggas lookin'
And a henn from a smile
But inside, blood cooking
Got a problem wit' my style
Wit' the clique, wit' the clan
Lames, I don't understand
If you feel that you real
Fuck it's on, grab the steel
On the real, hoes run they mouth
And get pimp smacked
Automatic gat, get yo' motherfuckin' head crack
Heat tight, trick tight
Killas pullin' pistol play
When you pull ya tone
My nig' that's where you gon' lay
I'm a say this to you haters wit' them problems
Step up to the Patsta
Boy, I'ma solve 'em

Suck me, paid me
Mane that's what yo' bitch do
Lovin' me the most 'cause I let her do the clique too
Prophet Posse, all these hoes never frontin'
Mane, they off that ezay
Gobblin' up somethin'
Dick in ya mouth
Slow it down wit' that rough stuff
Fine vicious cat, toes curlin' like a cheese puff
Cheese first, cap blast
AC blows in the tent
(Tell these girls whats goin' on)
Nothing, ho, but the rent
Got me bent out of shape
To you hoes that are fake
Get the fuck out my face
'Fore I shoot you in ya face
Murder rate shall increase
Mother-fuck the police
Ridin' up on yo' ass, then ya ass be deceased
Never peace where I live
Known for the cross-out
First haters step, first haters get tossed out

For the nine nine, North Memphis (Memphis, Tennessee)
Smokin' on that light-light, what y'all know about that?
Probably don't even wanna hit this motherfucka
Once again, get as high as you can
