Let me see your gold shine
Let me see your gold shine
Let me see your gold shine, let me see your gold shine
Let me see your gold shine
Let me see your gold shine
Let me see your gold shine, let me see your gold shine

Hoody Hoo is the one, he be off in this game
Gold chain pinky ring, say to hell with some fame
Hustlin' to the end, ain't afraid of the pen
Treated dogs like his kin, got his brand on his skin
Drankin' fists of that Henny, I went and bought some Remy
A ho can come with genny, but she don't give a penny
I'm out there havin' plenty, I'm slangin' shit like Lenny
From Good Times to South Park, you can die like Kenny
So try to get some money, for those actin' funny
You stay about the cheese mane, muthafuck the honey
Now don't you be a dummy, play me like gin rummy
I try to keep it business to keep food in my tummy
The ghetty, ghetty green on them 20s, ridin' clean
'Cause snatchin', paper chasin' just like I'm a fiend
It's yo boy Project Pat, never catch me droppin' dimes
I'ma let my gold shine, I'ma let my gold shine
You might also like
All playas hustle in, let me see your gold shine
All my playas comin' up, let me see your gold shine
Gold rangs, gold chains, gold teeth on the grind
Let me see your gold shine, let me see your gold shine

Could it be a dream? Crunchy bling bling
Popped up on the scene, Rolex diamond ring
Hypnotize bling when you see me
I'ma shine like a diamond in your fuckin' screen

Like a diamond, I'ma shine free so you know it's me
Every time you writin' rhymes, Coco, all you know it's me
Bustas always hatin' me, knowin' they be playin' me
Get a name right next time you dissin' me on this CD B

Double O Seven money
I was playin' on a PlayStation
Driveby wavin' at you haters
Holla at ya, see ya later, alligator
Skin cold world bustin', coward's curtain
You ain't fuck, what you mean, playa?
Playas from the Hollywood, Evergreen is my hood
Smokin city, show them gold teeth, ridin' in the woods
Brakin on some pound in the south, Memphis fuckin' town
Chiefin' on some hay everyday like a coupon

All playas hustle in, let me see your gold shine
All my playas comin' up, let me see your gold shine
Gold rangs, gold chains, gold teeth on the grind
Let me see your gold shine, let me see your gold shine

I was ridin' Buick wood, now I'm pushin' me a 'lex
I was nobody in the hood, now on chrome thangs I flex
I was wishin I was you, now you wishin' you was me
Take a walk in my shoes, aw, it could never be
See, a playa stay down till he rise like some dough
If he true to his game then his game stay afloat
Who can cope with this real ass shit that I spit?
If you real and you know it then many, toss a bitch
To a real tight playa, South side playa
Mask on my mug when I blast on a Hateaaa
Loot's what I'm clockin', robbers I'm watchin'
Nine milly Ruger many, that's what I'm cockin'
Lames I diminish, I balls to the finish
This ain't Popeye so I don't need no spinach
I'm just a young mane havin thangs on the grind
I'm a let my gold shine, I'm a let my gold shine

All playas hustle in, let me see your gold shine
All my playas comin' up, let me see your gold shine
Gold rangs, gold chains, gold teeth on the grind
