Ruthless, that was my style as a juvenile
I ran with gangs niggas I slanged, but in the meanwhile
I hang with BHZ rockers rockers on twenty-three chrome
You got your gun on you, I hate it if you done left it at home
'Cause six is blasting nice and fast and better clean your glasses
We quick to sneak and put you to sleep like a certain mattress
You soft like pussy, so I guess that's why you smell like one
Bitch fuck alone, you better go and get your fucking gun
I'll have you begging for a double dose of Percocet
Your money bank if I touch you, and you don't get wet
We made a movie on you hoes, I know you loved it didn't
You started telling your girl, man I could of been in it
But you a fuck nigga, niggas don't fuck with you nigga
You Donnie Brasco need to cali coat nigga
I'm sick and tired of dissing you hoes on these CD's
I'm 'bout to start dissing you hoes on my DVD's

I'mma start this one off with a toast for my nina ross
We don't run the rap game, but this city we the boss
North Memphis, South Memphis, Westwood, Orange Mound
Project Pat in this motherfucker layin smack down
Crackin' down on you punk niggas talkin' too much gang
Snortin' all your dope up claiming that you in the game
False flaggin' bitches, I'll catch you outta hell
Informant ass snitches, protection fees in jail
What you pay dead body lay once the bullets spray
'Round the way with the escape with no delay
You gon' pay cause these nine mil'uh mills quick to mop'uh
Wack a snitch off take ya life off the whoppa choppa
Get the choppa put the mask on, nobody gon' live knock knock
Get my blast on, all up in your grill
All a nigguh wanted dawg was a piece of the pie, pie
But when my tone's in your face you say bye bye
Now only weak niggas like to start bullshit'uh

Niggas love to see this hate on the ten o'clock news
Project Pat got arrested by them boys in blues
He must be guilty of sin, send his ass to the pen
God have mercy on his boys so I'm back here again
Niggas lie to they dawgs 'bout the shit that they do
Point blank range one in chain when I aim straight at you
When I squeez on this trigga it's uh ooh spaghetti o's
The hollow hit you and the bloody run down your nose
Kidnap a sucka, put the duck tape around his mouth
A snitching fucker and he knows who's I'm talkin' 'bout
The nina popping and I'll put you permandisly
Push you in river with some bricks wrapped around your feet
'Cause when it's ana' best believe we gon' bring the heat
With extra clips, 'cause we do not accept defeat
I'm busting rounds and your chest will see cave'uhment
Then get on down when your body hit pave'uhment
