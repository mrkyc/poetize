The pain is what, I'm bring it to you dawg
No love for those, who ain't about there hog
The script has flipped and Hypnotized has came
'Cause we the crew are rich off in the game
The hood is hard like cotton pickin' days
We breakin' law just like we rebellious slaves
We blaze and ride my mouth it fool of gold's
We sell the snow we also kick in do's
The murder rate increases to the full
The 'dro is passed after I take a pull
I'm hustlin' sun up until sun down
A pharmacist wit' client out on the town
We wild just like the gorillas in the zoo
If you da weak then I'mma fuck wit' you
Retaliation nigga it's a must
Don't get too close, the rugers they will bust

I'm the main nigga on these bricks who don't give a fuck
If I had to rob a trick or a armored truck
Lay it down don't you make a sound or I shall unload
Face the ground fo I buck you down project ain't no ho
To the rule of society heavy in this shit
Slang 'caine standing on my feet playa I'm da lick
Who could say when the bullets spray that I won't get hit
That's the change my nigga I'll take, slapped ah extra clip
Right on in and commence to blast lookin' through the mask
Full of gin question neva ask, murder is the task
Poppin' lead 'til I empty the whole magazine
To yo head tryin' to chop it off like a guillotine
Crossing me and you know I can't accept a loss
In the M we like to get high and we like to cross
Who's the boss, is the man standing 'round the chalk line
Growin' old with his wife and kids didn't do time
We ain't scared ho, we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, naw we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, naw we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, naw we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, naw we ain't scared ho

Kick a trick in his anal hole, knowing that I ain't a hoe
Pull the hammer back aim for dome crush ya cantaloupe
Kill 'em by my weaponry, mane I got no preferences
Nothing but some bullets for you punks with discrepancy
Conflicts bully shit anna and dat hate-cha-ret
Don't be talking crazy to me ho, 'cause I ain't your bitch
Convict bustin' head with a heart neva scared
Quick to pull a techin on, will shoot the fuckin lead
Police think they can get some, drunk and strapped with a gun
You can see what I'm 'bout, they gon' have to take me out
Trill nigga keep it trill, weak niggas fake the deal
Goin' out to goin' out to do some shit, hesitation got him killed
Worried 'bout consequence, worried 'bout the witnesses
Put a mask on gone in and do the shit
Tell the nigga drop it off, make the suckas give ya some
Take the goody good, don't just stand there, nigga run
We ain't scared ho, we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, naw we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, naw we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, naw we ain't scared ho
We ain't scared ho, we ain't scared ho
