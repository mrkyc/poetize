Ski mask over my skull
Papers in my mouth, 'cause I'm grilled
Bitch it's a house call
Glock-9 wit' no love
Killaz from the south got appeal
Caps that make the shells fall

Yeah, as you walk in the valley of a devil
Nigga, betta watch your mufuckin self
Don't step in shit that you can't handle
Walkin' in the dark man, so you need a candle
Can yo ass pay off what you was fronted?
Wanna sell weed but you stay gettin' blunted
Cross-head cutters from the hood, now you wanted
Just like a man to the deer, you the hunted
When they catch you, you prepare for the slaughter
Don't be surprised you done stepped in they quarter
Kick in your door, put the gun to your daughter
Business is shit like silver to copper
Reachin' for your shit, all you had was a Glock-a
MAK-90's on ya dog, mufuckin choppa's
Ski mask on they face wit' a bandana
Ready man to take care of all this damn error

Niggas talk a lot of shit but watch they bitch ass get tried

If you knowin' I got rep to protect in this shit
Clientele I done dealt those who crossed in a ditch
Where they lay bullets spray when I give out the word
Is a piece of the pie, off a crumb or a bird
I done payed off my dues, I done been in this shoes
That was me put them dead bodies on the damn news
I got eyes watchin' you and your family too
I got ears in the street and you know how I do
Taken me for a fool, I'm the nigga that you came
Hollerin' at for some work, now you take it as a game
I'm the main nigga here, they don't wanna fuck up
All this bullshit I hear, playa you done fucked up
You be dead 'fore you know, body neva be found
Man, you betta get my dough 'fore I put you in the ground
Oh, he hung the phone up, he done blew my damn high
Callin' real killaz up, 'cause this boy gotta die
