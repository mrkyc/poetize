Just like a buzzin' fly, I come into your life
Now I float away like honey in the sun
Was it right or wrong?
I couldn't sing that song anyway

Oh, but darlin', now I remember
How the sun shown down
And how it warmed your prayin' smile
When all the love was there

You're the one I talk about, you're the one I think about
Everywhere I go
And sometimes, honey, in the mornin'
Lord, I miss you so
That's how I know I found a home
That's how I know I found a home

Oh, hear the mountains singing
Lord, I can hear them ringing, darlin', out your name
And tell me if you know just how that river flows
Down to the sea
You might also like
Now I wanna know everything about you
I wanna know everything about you
What makes you smile, what makes you wild
What makes you love me this way
Darlin', I wanna know
Darlin', I wanna know

You're the one I talk about, you're the one I think about
Everywhere I go
But sometimes, honey, in the mornin'
Lord, I miss you so
That's how I know I found a home
That's how I know I found a home

A-walkin' hand in hand and all along the sand
A seabird knew your name
He knew your love was growin', Lord, I think it knows it's flowin'
Through you and me
Ah, tell me darlin', when I should leave you
Ah, tell me darlin', I don't want to grieve you

Just like a buzzin' fly, I come into your life
Now I float away like honey in the sun
Was it right or wrong?
I couldn't sing that song anyway
Oh, but darlin', now I remember
How the sun shown down
And how it warmed your prayin' smile
When all the love was there

You're the one I talk about, you're the one I think about
Everywhere I go
But sometimes, honey, in the mornin'
Lord, I miss you so

I miss you so
I miss you so
I miss you so
