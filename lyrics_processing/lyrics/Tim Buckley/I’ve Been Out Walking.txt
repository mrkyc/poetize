Ah Lord I sit alone and weep all the time to hesitate
Ah now darling don't you cry
I'm just waiting for the sun to shine
Ain't got no heart to sell you
Ain't got no time to tell you
All the answers you came to hear
I just came down from the mountain
And now you know me when I was just a child in your heart
I been waiting so long to say it
I been losing but I been choosing
I've been living on borrowed time
Trying to pay back the debts I owe you
Ah but I never show you why the river could be a woman
Why the sky will ever open
I just want to be here tonight love
I wanna take myself a plane back home
I got a sweet little woman oh but I'm gone now
And I wonder what my little darling does for love
She's walking all alone and here I'm trying to get back home
Hey tell me is there a sadder place to be right now
Ah but now I could hear those mountains ringing all around me
You might also likeI feel it won't take too long to get through it and sing a song
Ah but I don't know if my love can last, oh no
You know I just came in on the rail
Ah damn to keep me another shirt tail
And I been trying to make it ever since oh love
I got a name but mama don't you know I'm ashamed
I been out walking now I ain't been too in much talking
Oh Lord my heart's got too much to yield
Yes but I bring you in now darling
Remember when I was so strong how the liquor and women wore me down
I'm on my knees begging oh please
Hear the mountains ringing, hear the birds a singing
Feel the sun shine on your hands
Just smell the river flow well now
I know my love is growing hear the way the children smile
Makes you glad that you been choosing
Which time you been losing
