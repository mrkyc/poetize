I don't wanna be the one to try
Being someone else is not my style
There's a missing piece I'm trying to find
I don't know how, but you made me look twice

Sleep, I don't need no sleep
I've had such a week
I just wanna take off flying
High, higher than the birds
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

There's no hide and seek
I see you, see me
What's the mystery?
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
Give it up, let go

Keep on asking, why is there divide?
I'm hanging on to see if we collide
And we don't need to know the place or time
As long as I am yours and you are mine
You might also like
Sleep, I don't need no sleep
I've had such a week
I just wanna take off flying
High, higher than the birds
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

There's no hide and seek
I see you, see me
What's the mystery?
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
Give it up, let go

There's no hide and seek
I see you, see me
What's the mystery
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
Give it up, let go
Sleep, I don't need no sleep
I've had such a week
I just wanna take off flying
High, higher than the birds
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

There's no hide and seek
I see you, see me
What's the mystery?
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
