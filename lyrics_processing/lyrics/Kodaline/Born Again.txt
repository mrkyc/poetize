Here I go again
Reaching for the light
I fall back down to earth
Every single time
I found my oxygen, brings me back to life
It always looks like you
Looks like you

You make me want to be better
Taking me back to the line
We'll always be stronger together
Take on the world when you're mine
I never believed in heroes
How darkness could turn into light
I know they say never say never
But I'll never, ever

I won't stop fighting
But not fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I'll keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again
You might also like
One day, we'll be gone
We only get one life
We'll be the things we've done
And what we've left behind
The strength to carry on
In the back of my mind
It always looks like you
Looks like you

You make me want to be better
Taking me back to the line
We'll always be stronger together
Take on the world when you're mine
I never believed in heroes
How darkness could turn into light
I know the say never say never
But I'll never, ever

I won't stop fighting
But not fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I'll keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again

I found my oxygen
To bring me back to life
It always looks like you

I won't stop fighting
But not fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I'll keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again

Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
Born again, born again
