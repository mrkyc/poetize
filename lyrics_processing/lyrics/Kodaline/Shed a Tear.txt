It's harder to see through the eyes of a stranger
It's easier to love when the world doesn't hate you
When you try to sing out but nobody hears a word
It's safer to swim when the tide's not against you

Yeah, yeah
(You've been here before)
I know you've been here before
(Never letting go)
And giving up is letting go
(Never fight alone)
But you don't have to fight alone

I shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leaving you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walking in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear
That I shed a, I shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
(Shed a tear, shed a tear)
You might also like
And I feel your pain when I know you're in trouble
And I'll take the blame from your hurt in your struggle
And when you're trying to speak out, but nobody hears a word
I'll be your voice, lay your head on my shoulder

Oh (You've been here before)
I know you've been here before
(Never letting go)
And nothing is impossible
(Never fight alone)
You don't have to fight alone

I shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leavin' you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walking in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear

That I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (Shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (Shed a tear)
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (Shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (Shed a tear)
And when you're livin' in your darkest hour
And when you're gettin' closer to the edge

I shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leavin' you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walkin' in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear

I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (Shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (Shed a tear)
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (Shed a tear)
