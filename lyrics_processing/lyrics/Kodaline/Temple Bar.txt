Friday night and no one's home
There's no point getting drunk alone
Grab your coat and make a call
I'll meet you down in Temple Bar
People come and people go
So raise a glass to who you know
Winter hasn't taken hold
So why do I feel so cold?

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?

Oh where did it all go wrong, go wrong?
Oh where did it all go wrong, go wrong?

Saw a girl that I used to know
It's funny how the heart moves on
She's got a home and a family
I get the feeling she's forgotten me
People leave their mark and go
Like footprints in the winter snow
When winter hasn't taken hold
Why do I feel so cold?
You might also like
Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?

Oh, where did it all go wrong, go wrong?
Oh, where did it all go wrong, go wrong?

Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?

Oh, where did it all go wrong, go wrong?
