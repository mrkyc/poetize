When we were young, we were the ones
The kings and queens, oh yeah, we ruled the world
We smoked cigarettes, man, no regrets
Wish I could relive every single word

We've taken different paths
And travelled different roads
I know we'll always end up on the same one when we're old
And when you're in the trenches
And you're under fire, I will cover you

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs so you could breathe

I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er

Oh, brother, we go deeper than the ink
Beneath the skin of our tattoos
Though we don't share the same blood
You're my brother and I love you, that's the truth
You might also like
We're living different lives
Heaven only knows
If we'll make it back with all our fingers and our toes
Five years, twenty years, come back
It will always be the same, oh-oh, oh-oh

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs so you could breathe

I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er

And if we hit on troubled water
I'll be the one to keep you warm and safe
And we'll be carrying each other
Until we say goodbye on our dying day
Because I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs so you could breathe

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've got you, brother-er-er-er-er
