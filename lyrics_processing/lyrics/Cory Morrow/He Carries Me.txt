Of the people passing by
There are scars on their hearts
That they hide
Faithful and fragile, Doubting their path
They carry the weight of the world on their backs
I know the got a long way to go
Yes I know we've got a long way to go
But I know every day I'm lucky
Just to breathe the air I breathe
And I hope everyone can feel this love
Thats busting out of me
And sometimes I forget just to forgive even me
Sometimes I stumble, Thats when he carries me
Sometimes I stumble, Thats when he carries me
Oh Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Morning wakes uncertian of what will come
And I will question where my happiness comes from
I've lived in castles, and out on the street
But I'm still seduced by the demons that make me weak
I know I've got a long way to go
Yes I know I've got a long way to go
But I know every day I'm lucky
Just to breathe the air I breathe
And I hope everyone can feel this love
Thats busting out of me
And sometimes I forget just to forgive even me
Sometimes I stumble, Thats when he carries me
Sometimes I stumble, Thats when he carries me
We've both suffered on this road we traveled on
It is cold, It is lonely, It is dark
Oh but there is hope
And its hope that carries on
And I know everyday I'm lucky
Just to breathe the air I breathe
And I hope everyone can feel this love
Thats busting out of me
And sometimes I forget just to forgive even me
Sometimes I stumble, Thats when he carries me
Sometimes I stumble, Thats when he carries me
Oh Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Yeah yeah Yeah
