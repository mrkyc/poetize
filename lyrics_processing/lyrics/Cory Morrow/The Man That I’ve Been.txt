Tomorrow I go up with life but I should go straight to hell
But hell's got no more room for me and it's got no more time
I should be confessin' all my crimes
Four years ago my debt was piled high up on my mind
And I devised a plan to rob a bank just to survive
When the gun smoke cleared I saw two bodies on the ground
13 hours later I was found
No don't you feel any sorrow for the man that I've been
'Cause in the waking of tomorrow, they will find me full of sin
Well I got news for you, I ain't as bad as they say
I got news for you, looks like that just don't matter today
Oh well the verdict came in right away, guilty indeed
99 to life is what I heard the jury
They thought that might impress upon me crime does not pay
But I ain't one for listenin' today
And as the years go by and by upon the shadowed grounds I walk
The people and the places of my past have now been lost
That man that I've been is not the man I hoped to be
Now it's too late to find the good in me
Don't you feel any sorrow for the man that I've been
'Cause in the waking of tomorrow, they will find me full of sin
Well I got news for you, I ain't as bad as they say
I got news for you, looks like that just don't matter today
You might also likeDon't you feel any sorrow for the man that I've been
'Cause in the waking of tomorrow, they will find me full of sin
I got news for you, I ain't as bad as they say
I got news for you, it looks like that just don't matter today
