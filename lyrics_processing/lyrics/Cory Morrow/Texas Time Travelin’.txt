I'm goin on a trip through history
I wanna see some sights today
Yeah we'll go back when time was young
And you learned the trigger of a gun
Or you'd be six feet on your way
When the mountains closed the valley side
And rivers held the miners pride
It was the year of forty-nine
Well those days are now gone and dead
And I wish that I could see the lead
Flying from the cowboys iron
Chorus
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna be there, breathe the air and see all I can see
In my Texas time travelin' machine
The day goes on, the sun beats down
It bakes your skin to golden brown
Now your feelin like a king
We'll pull off along side the road
And see the land ol Jesse owned
And all the times he spent with me
You might also likeThen along the skyline of the trees
We'll skinny dip within the stream
And we'll flash the passing cars
Then we'll jump into our Cadillac
The tracks of time will take us back
Back to the land off so far
Chorus
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna be there, breathe the air and see all I can see
In my Texas time travelin' machine
You've got to take a look around
And see this land before it drowns
Underneath the city streets
Geronimo he said it best
This is my land I will not rest
Until I'm dead or it's been freed
Chorus
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna be there, breathe the air and see all I can see
In my Texas time travelin' machine
Chorus
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna go time travelin' through Texas you and me
I wanna be there, breathe the air and see all I can see
