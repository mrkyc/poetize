You remember being just sixteen
Fall in love and feeling free
There was this girl and she filled your mind
And you said she'd be the one this time
Ah but, she never turned her head when you walked by
You never made her laugh or caught her eye
But you swore in silence everyday
That you would some how make her turn your way
She would fall under your magic spell
The day's go by, Ohhhh
I wish she could see me in a different light
I wish that I'd of told her on that fateful night
Maybe then she could have been my bride
I'd stop searching everyday and Night
Oh Angela
Can you ever feel the way I do for you
Oh Angela
Don't you know I'll always dream of you
You just passed your turn around eighteen
Your still wondering what those feelings mean
Catch your eye and you start to smile
She turns away just for a little while ' Ohhh but
You tell her it was always meant to be
She says don't give your heart so easily
She holds him tight and kisses him so free
And you scream, lord that should be me
And she should be under your magic spell
The days go by ' Ohhh-ho
You might also likeI wish she could see me in a different light
I wish that I'd of told her on that fateful night
Maybe then she could have been my bride
And I'd stop searching everyday and Night
Oh Angela
Can you ever feel the way I do for you
Oh Angela
Don't you know I'll always dream of you
Oh Angela
Can you ever feel the way I do for you
Oh Angela
Don't you know I'll always dream
You know I'll always dream
