I said, "I can't quit, it's all I know and I can't afford to die
How am I suppose to pay your bill the I'm six feet in the ground?
Who in the hell is gonna feed my dog when I'm no longer 'round?"
I said, "Isn't there somethin' you can do doc? Some kinda pill or remedy?"
He said, "I ain't never heard of no drug that works to keep a man from bein' lazy"
"Lazy? Now just watch it Doc, 'cause I work really hard
See from 10PM to 2AM every night I play my guitar
That's right, that's right, and I drink real hard and I smoke real hard
And hell I hardly have time to sleep
Lately I've been eatin' so damn hard I can hardly feel my feet, oh can't even see 'em
About ten and a half double d"
Well I sat down and I pondered a while about what that good doc had said
And I thought real quietly to myself, "You know, maybe I'd be better off dead
Now you see, a dead man don't have to worry about the police for any warrants he might have out
And I'd no longer have to hide from the credit card collectors tryin' to flush my dead beat out
Yeah man that'd be great, no more smoke filled lungs or bars
And no more worryin' 'bout that big ol' beer belly I'm gonna get from drinkin' too hard"
"Spare tire, it's a Dunlop 44 Extra Wide
No more playin' all night long, no more hangovers that last all damn day
July 5th is official hangover day
No more meetin' beautiful Texas women and rollin' 'round in the hay"
Well I've got some find memories of San Angelo
And I've seen some beauty queens in El Paso
But the best lookin' women that I've ever seen
Have all been in Texas and all wearin' jeans
I'm a country plowboy not an urban cowboy
And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
And drivin' pick up trucks just ain't got enough
And I live to love Texas women

Who the hell am I kiddin'? I don't wanna die
I gotta lot of things left to do
Got a lotta drinkin' and smokin' and pickin' and grinnin'
Writin' songs for all of you
I wanna live forever
At least as long as I can
I wanna smoke them cigarettes
And feel the burnin' in my lungs man
I wanna drink a lot of whiskey
And get drunk and stupid stoned
I wanna make love to my woman
Feel the passion burn all night long
Lord, don't take me now
You got to give me a little more time
I got few loose ends down here to tie up
A lotta worries on my mind
I wanna live forever, just as long as I can
I wanna smoke them Marlboro Lights
And feel the burnin' in my lungs again
I wanna drink Wild Turkey
And get drunk and stupid stoned
I wanna make love to my Texas woman
All night long
Lord, don't take me now
You got to give me a little more time
I got few loose ends down here to tie up
A lotta worries on my mind
Lord I got few loose ends down here to tie up
Oh don't you know I can't afford
