And handed it to me and swirled
I said I done nothing wrong
I was framed all along
Now they lied right from the start
When they stole my lonely heart
In the picture that you hold
Lies the hidden truth untold
Chorus
And I was just along for the ride
Where the train's bound I don't know
But I'll ride
I just wanted to go
Farther than I'd been
Now I'm along for the ride again
It was a long cold rainy day
They kept their smiles at bay
Oh to them it was just a game
To play with my life this way
When the first man drew his gun
Silence befell everyone
Oh but a girl she ran for the door
And he gunned her down to the floor
You might also likeNow we grabbed the loot and we rode
For the posse would soon be formed
Oh but the girl she laid so cold
As pale as the untouched snow
Chorus
I was just along for the ride
Where the train's bound I don't know
But I'll ride
I just wanted to go
Farther than I'd been
Now I'm along for the ride again
We'd ride thru rain and snow
Not knowing just which way to go
Oh but this would be my last ride
I'd take my leave tonight
And the day before we were found
In a picture we all gathered round
Four men and a lie
I was the only one that was blind
Oh now I sit in this cell
I'm waiting my day in hell
So boy you listen good
There ain't no refuge in the hood
Oh and there's nobody to blame
I'm a fool of my own acclaim
Yeah I thought I'd been so wise
But these men proved my demise
And the train moves down the line
For a different town each night
Oh in search of a boy like me
In search of a youth in need
Chorus
I was just along for the ride
Where the trains' bound I don't know
But I'll ride
I just wanted to go
Farther than I'd been
