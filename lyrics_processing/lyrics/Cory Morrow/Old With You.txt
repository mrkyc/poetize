It was Austin in the month of June
You were actin' kind of shy but I think you knew
You were turnin' every head in the room
There are 15 guys tryin' to find the lines
To help them get their hands on you
While they were undressin' you with their eyes
I was picturin' your hair turned blue
I wanna get old with you
I wanna get wrinkled too
I wanna drive 45 on the highway
Like the old folks do
If I wander off or lose my way
I want the cops to bring me home to you
Oh if I'm gonna get old
I wanna get old with you
I was never really one to take a hint
But when I saw you all of that changed
It wasn't crazy wantin' you in my bed
It was crazy wantin' you to stay
I was just livin' it day to day
Not carin' what the future brings
Now I'm plannin' out the next 30 years
Buildin' us a front porch swing
You might also likeI wanna get old with you
I wanna get wrinkled too
I wanna drive 45 on the highway
Like the old folks do
If I wander off or lose my way
I want the cops to bring me home to you
Well if I'm gonna get old
I wanna get old with you
I don't think ill make it
If I can't get there with you
And I don't think "'til death do us 'part" sounds right
'Cause that's what quitters do
I wanna get old with you
I wanna get wrinkled too
I wanna drive 45 on the highway
Like the old folks do
If I wander off or lose my way
I want the cops to bring me home to you
If I'm gonna get old
I wanna get old
If I've gotta get old
I wanna get old
If I'm gonna get old
I wanna get old with you
You were 20 years old and I was 32
