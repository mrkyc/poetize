No, we don't want no guys like you
I lied my way til December
Hoping Christmas would pull me through
And then I hung around thinking religion would take its toll
The lord threw no signs that day
It seemed that no one would take me at all
Then I saw the light on the stage
And I said sing with me
Oh sing with me
Sing all night long
Then hold me close until the morning sun
Comes searching for the dawn
I hitched my way back to Houston
Where I knew that I'd find a home
My mother claimed no vacancy
In this new house that I'd never known
I found myself a stray all alone
Caught up in the midst of my pain
In the howling winds of the night
I swore someone was calling my name
I turned only to see the light on the stage
And I said sing with me
Oh sing with me
Sing all night long
Then hold me close until the morning sun
Comes searching for the dawn
You might also likeI took my last dollar
Made some change, and I called a friend
He said that's no problem pal
You know we'd love to take you in
So he helped me through my trials
With some peace from the Lord above
Next thing I know I'm on the stage
Doing everything that I've dreamed of
Now it seems that I am the light on the stage
Now it seems that we are the lights on the stage
And I said sing with me
Oh sing with me
Sing all night long
Then hold me close until the morning sun
Comes searching for the dawn
And I said sing with me
Oh sing with me
Sing with me all night long
Then hold me close until the morning sun
