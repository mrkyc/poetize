And I mean it when I say
I'm proud to do my duty
For the good ol' USA
They sent me to an Island
In the Caribbean Sea
But it ain't no pearl at all
It's just another place to be
And I wonder what I'll do again tonight
Maybe have a couple beers
And try to keep out of fights
I don't wanna bust your bubble
I don't wanna bring ya down
But out here in GTMO
It's the only game in town
They promised us new gear
And they promised us new boots
They promised in four months
We'd be replaced by new recruits
I got here in January
Thinkin' I'd be home by spring
Now it's looking like I'll need to buy
A Cuban Christmas tree
Oh Santa won't you come this way?
Do you need directions to Guantanamo Bay?
You might also likeI don't wanna bust your bubble
I don't wanna bring ya down
But out here in GTMO
It's the only game in town
They've got the Army, Navy, Air Force
And United States Marines
Hell they even got the Coast Guard
Lookin' out for submarines
It's a lonely girl''s paradise
That's what they're tellin' me
But lonely's just a state of mind
They both look good to me
Jumpin' off the cliffs
Into a shark infested bay
Dodgin' jellyfish
Just another fun-filled day
I don't wanna bust your bubble
I don't wanna bring ya down
But out here in GTMO
It's the only game in town
There's 4,000 cubans
On the north side of the fence
Just waitin' for a chance
To put their trainin' to the test
Sometime's I wish they would man
I'd give that exam
And show 'em how we do it
When we fight for Uncle Sam
I wonder if the people at home
Have any idea at all where we've gone
I don't wanna bust your bubble
I don't wanna bring ya down
But out here in GTMO
It's the only game in town
I don't wanna bust your bubble
I don't wanna bring ya down
But out here in GTMO
It's the only game in town
Out here in GTMO
