Before I start the Pledge of Allegiance
There's a reason
It's to honor those who died
And if you see me close my eyes and bow my head
Before I break bread with my family
It ain't a habit, it's important
It's my right
I work half the year for me
The other half for Uncle Sam
While he's bailin' out those sinkin' ships
And drownin' the little man
I watch the news and have to wonder
If this country's goin' crazy
Talkin' 'bout how much they love it here
But how they want to rearrange it
I'm just your Average Joe
And that makes me smart enough to know
There's a bunch of us out here
That feel the same
Wanna keep our God, our freedom
A little money in the bank
You might also likeY'all can keep the change
Now the fat cats on the hill actin' so brilliant
Ain't smart enough to notice
That we're angry
And that America's in trouble
If they don't wise-up and stop
Bustin' out the blocks that were laid
As a foundation, well, our nation
Could wake up in a pile of ruble
They say we're makin' progress
But it's a big old shame to me
Common sense ain't near as common
As it used to be
I watch the news and have to wonder
If this country's goin' crazy
Talkin' 'bout how much they love it here
But how they want to rearrange it
Well, I'm just your Average Joe
And that makes me smart enough to know
There's a bunch of us out here
That feel the same
Wanna keep our God, our freedom
A little money in the bank
Y'all can keep the change
I bet our grandpas are gettin' dizzy
Down there in their graves
Rollin' over and over
Over what's goin' on these days
I watch the news and have to wonder
If this country's goin' crazy
Talkin' 'bout how much they love it here
But how they want to rearrange it
I'm just your Average Joe
And that makes me smart enough to know
There's a bunch of us out here
That feel the same
Gonna keep our God, our freedom
A little money in the bank
Y'all can keep the change
Just keep the change
