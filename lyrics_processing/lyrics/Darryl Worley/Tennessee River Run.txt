Lets make a Tennessee River Run
Hey everybody I think the time is right
Lets get together down where the catfish bite
Cooped up all winter
Waiting on a day like this
It's the way I feel when I'm rockin on the water
Baby that I can't resist
Bar-B-Q grill, summer time jam
Just about a mile above the Pickwick Dam
Party on the water whole lotta fun
Time to make a Tennessee River Run
I'll get my bass boat, crank up your party barge
We'll drop these anchors out where the big boats are
Break out a cooler, pass out ice-cold beer
Look at all the people out here on the water
Man I can't believe we're here
Swingin' on a rope gonna have a ball
Jumpin' off the Yellow Creek waterfall
Checkin out the honeys, bakin in the sun
God bless a Tennessee River Run
Doo-dee n' doo dee
Doo dee n' doo
Doo dee n' doo dee
Doo dee doodle doo
Doo-dee n' doo dee
Doo dee n' doo
Doo dee n' doo dee
Doo dee doodle doo

I should be leaving tomorrows a work week day
I just might call in, tell em' that I can't get home
Does anybody else want to stay a little longer
Or am I gonna be alone?
Floatin on a tube, gonna weigh a ton
Cajun sausage on a hot dog bun
Bar-B-Q grill, summertime jam
Just about a mile above the Pickwick Dam
Party on the water, whole lotta fun
Time to make a Tennessee River Run
Doo-dee n' doo dee
Doo dee n' doo
Doo dee n' doo dee
Doo dee doodle doo
Doo-dee n' doo dee
Doo dee n' doo
Doo dee n' doo dee
Doo dee doodle doo
Nothin like a Tennessee River Run
I love a Tennessee River Run
