The truth is I really ain't sure
But I've been in this van going on fifteen hours
My back and my butt, God they hurt
There's a sign up ahead flashing in red
From Nashville appearing tonight
It's always the same, they misspell my name
Still I love the honky tonk life
Hey Soir, grab the guitars and I'll get the speakers
Could somebody plug in my amp?
If we hurry, they'll feed us before we go on
And I'll work it out with the man
Sometimes the beer's free, sometimes it's half price
And sometimes there's no beer at all
But me and the boys'll be making some noise
Either way 'til they give that last call
And the guys will be drinking, the girls will be dancing
Dancing up there on the bar
This joint's got an atmosphere, blue collar, cold beer
Decidedly come as you are
I could quit all this road stuff go back to my real job
And put in a straight nine to five
But I love the neon, I love the people
And I love the honky tonk life
You might also likeI got a wink from a barmaid straight out of a magazine
Man, that girl's breaking my heart
Now I've got ten after but according to tavern time
This gig is fixing to start
The crowd here is rowdier, the girls here are prettier
Than any place we've ever played
You've got us boys thinking if y'all keep on drinkin'
Tonight we might all just get paid
And the guys are all drinking, the girls are all dancing
Dancing up there on the bar
This joint's got an atmosphere, blue collar, cold beer
Decidedly come as you are
I could quit all this road stuff go back to my real job
And put in a straight nine to five
But I love the neon and I love the people
And I love the honky tonk life
Yeah, I love the neon and I love the people
