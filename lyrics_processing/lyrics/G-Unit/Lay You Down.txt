Ahhhh!

I, don't know what you been thinkin'
Don't know what you been drinkin'
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass down
Don't know what you been thinkin'
Don't know what you been drinkin'
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass down

I've been out in L.A. with Dre and Snoop for so long
I'm finna Crip walk and put some muhfuckin' khakis on (Uh huh)
Man that's aight, man I ain't got nuttin' to prove
I'm rich but I still live like I got nuttin' to lose
Look man, I don't know what you been drinkin'
I don't know what you been thinkin'
But get outta line, Snoop's upside ya head
The media they write whatever they choose (Yea!)
And the cops stay on my ass so I stay on the news (Whaaaat!)
These other rap niggas couldn't walk in my shoes
Went through a bunch of bullshit while I was payin' my dues
They say my music make a gangsta wanna pop somethin' (Woooo!)
Well tell them niggas they'll get popped, they should stop frontin'
You heard of me but do you know how I get down
Stay with a vest on, roll with a couple tre-pounds
In case you motherfuckers wanna jump bad now
Start some bullshit and I'ma lay ya punk ass down

Hittin' niggas from long range for writin' the wrong thangs (Uh huh)
My name Young Buck but I look like a old mayn (Yea)
Just 'cause I like ice don't compare me to Lil Wayne (Woo!)
I make rap niggas disappear like Lil' Zane (Come on!)
See Buck been shot, but not more than 50
I don't dance, what I look like signin' with Diddy? (Yea!)
I got plans, grenades and the G-Unit with me
And on command, we spray give a fuck who we hittin' (Blaaaat) (Get 'em Buck)
What's in my hand? A K and 'bout a hundred and sixty
Hollow tips, four-fifths with the rubber grip
Crips and Bloods (What's up nigga) they show me love like I'm claimin' a set
These industry niggas know they better pay me my cheque (Wooo!)
I get a kick outta seein' these broke ass rappers
Ten people showed up, that's why your show got cancelled (Yea!)
50 whatever they did to the kid is handled
Niggas callin' for these features but they get no answers
Fuck y'all niggas

Don't know what you been drinkin'
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass down

Every Billboard chart

Man we own that slot
We won't stop

I, don't know what you been thinkin'
Don't know what you been drinkin'
But you get outta line boy, I'll lay your ass down
Don't know what you been thinkin'
Don't know what you been drinkin'

A bitch know it's a privilege if I stop to check her
Nigga all I got is hot shit, the kids call me Dr. Pepper (Ahhh!)
And I don't mean a soda (No)
The 16 top shot loader'll (Uh huh)
Bend ya ass up like yoga (Yea!)
Fuckin' with a soldier
Sellin' tickets for a first class trip to a hospital folder (Ahhh!)
So please keep talkin' (Go 'head)
So we can spread your feet
And have you on your boulevard C-Walkin' (Go, go, go)
The birds keep hawkin', why?
'Cause I'm heard in every CD (Go, go, go) and Walkman from D.C. to Boston
I laugh (Go, go, go) at a snotty chick, bitch I don't argue (No) (Go, go, go)
I leave a print in your ass from a karate kick (Ahhh!)
The niggas (Go, go, go) that I be with, got guns on the big body tip (Go, go, go)
And if they pull out you'd prolly shit (Go, go, go)
Jeweler got me in heavy gray pictures (Uh huh)
Plus I light up trees like everyday's Christmas
Ohhh, shit!
