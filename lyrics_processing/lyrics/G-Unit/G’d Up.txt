Ah, yeah...
Uh huh...

Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me
Feels like my emotions are froze
(I stay G'd up)
It's the things I done seen and the shit I been through
That made my heart turn cold
(I stay G'd up)
I'm a gangsta you find out fo sho if you ever step on my toes
(I stay G'd up)
When I'm hanging out that window with that AK filling your punk ass with holes
(I stay G'd up)

Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, marijuana
I'm mule on that Greyhound from NY to the Carolina
Paper chase, different name, same face, don't catch a case
My road dog's on parole, his baby girl's four years old
We play the block, pistol cocked, you could shoot or get shot
Kill you for your crack spot take everything your ass got
Semi-automatic spray, bust back or run away
Niggas talkin in the hood we'll handle this another day
In November you make my shitlist, you dead; you can cancel Christmas
I'll send you a gift, niggas'll come and leave your ass twisted
Them hollow tip shells burn baby burn
See a nigga get merked, a baby's born, man the world turns
I seen it all crystal clear so I keep my pistol near
Heart's never full of fear, homie I stay well aware
Of what's going on around me, motherfuckers want me dead
I go with a smile on my face when it's my time kid

Lil niggas I done paved the way, y'all should thank him
But if you think otherwise
Bring your boy over here so I can spank him
I put an end to your career, bitch! (Bitch!)
Before you speak on 50; buy a .40 and a spare clip (Yea!)
These niggas gassed up, getting to used (Uh huh) to rap
Like I won't give 'em more bloodclots than Supercat
Niggas'll snatch ya (Snatch ya)
I'm like a back catcher (Nigga)
I'll give a sign and then throw something at cha
Round here niggas die off hydro (Uh huh)
And even when it ain't 4th of July it sound like pyro (Boom!)
I'm smart enough to creep and lay your dumb brains down
The pound'll spin you around like the young James Brown, yea (Uh)
I know I'm hot but hey (Hey)
I'm icy too rocks'll hit you from a block away like a beat from Dr. Dre
We're taking over this year, K's and the soldiers is here
Everyone knows that your scared, yeah!

My papa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man
He'd just pop another bottle and smoke up a half a gram
I would hop in my Impala and ride all through the night
They gave my homeboy life so when you do it, do it right
My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue
I still got the heart to go and bust me a head or two
No other solution you think we hollering and hooting
Until you wake up and then you got to hear 'bout these shootings
I take a pull from a loosey and put the clip in my pocket
Before I take another bullet I'm gon' pull it and pop it
And if it's beef my nigga, then let your guns do your talking
The graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin
They say that we responsible for boosting the crime rate
They say that we the reason that these young niggas buying weight
But I'm gonna keep this Glock on my waist 'til my dying day
It's Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang, G-Unit and Dr. Dre
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me
Feels like my emotions are froze
(I stay G'd up)
It's the things I done seen and the shit I been through
That made my heart turn cold
(I stay G'd up)
