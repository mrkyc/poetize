50, the streets gon' fuck with this one

You never seen nothin' like this
G-Unit be the gang, I wish a nigga would, boy
Fuckin' with these bad bitches
I'm LeBron on you niggas cause scorin' in my shit, boy
I'm young Kobe cause I be dishin'
I be handlin' the rock, I be whippin' in the pot, boy
It's all about this fuckin' drug money
It's all about this fuckin' drug money
It's all about this fuckin' drug money
It's all about this fuckin' drug money

Hot 97, Funk Flex, shut it down
If ye' ain't know me then, I bet you know me now
Met a bad bitch, say we goin' downtown
She thinkin' 'bout shoppin' 'til I pull my pants down
I've come a long way from wearin' hand-me-downs
So if you got your hand out I slap your hand down
MC with the hammer, can't touch this
I buck shit, shoot, stab and cut shit
Say crawl before you walk, but nigga I run shit
All the hatin' just constipation, you don't want shit
Leave your thoughts on the curb, what the fuck you thinkin', bitch?
This is G-Unit, the G go for gangsta shit, let's go

You got a vitamin C deficiency
No cash, no credit, no customers, you ain't no fuckin' hustler
Ball in this rap game in Vera Wang
Strike the shepherd in his sheeps, scatter with good aim
Photobomb your picture with a long clip
Disarm a nigga, take his own grip
I'm in the meat packin' district, STK the state
Big faces in my safe, so these ho niggas hate
Catch him slippin' out filets, put his brains on his chicken patty
These bum niggas ain't classy

You never seen nothin' like this

We spill blood over spilled milk
We sell drugs 'til we get killed, lift weight 'til we get built
I'm prayin' that this heron do harm to them
Might be the last time the needle hit his arm again
My Mexican friends got me on the farm again
If you can handle it then haul it 'cross the border then
My granny say you never get too old to sell crack
Stop, she told me find somebody else to tell that
So why not distribute cocaine on my block?
And I just cooked a whole ki in the kitchen up with my pop
The molly made your momma spend her rent money
Be surprised all the shit she done did for me

You never seen nothin' like this
G-Unit be the gang, I wish a nigga would, boy
Fuckin' with these bad bitches
I'm LeBron on you niggas cause scorin' in my shit, boy
I'm young Kobe cause I be dishin'
