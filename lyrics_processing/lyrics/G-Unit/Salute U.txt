General, I salute you
I put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you
It ain't nuttin' cause loyalty's what I'm used to
And what I don't do I have one of my troops do
Nigga we'll kill you

I'm ready for combat, a soldier on the front line
Take it to the streets, nigga, motherfuck a punchline (C'mon!)
It only take one time for you to send a death threat
And watch these bullets have that ass singin' like Keith Sweat (Braaattttt)
You ain't met me yet, I been camouflaged in the bushes
And I'm co-signin' 50 'cause them niggas all pussy
Bustin' shots at ya convoy, you don't want war
No surrender, no retreat, this is Vietnam, boy (C'mon!)
Check my war wounds, I done took a couple for the team
Only niggas that been on the battlefield know what I mean (Yeah!)
Take cover, we comin' pullin' pins out of grenades
You won't make it to the General without gettin' sprayed (Bitch!)
Might as well say hello to my brand new little friend
Only time he come out to put holes in grown men (Come on)
You can send your troops and get 'em all blow back
Walk up on 'em with a deuce deuce and nigga hold that, Buck

General, I salute you
I put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you

And what I don't do I have one of my troops do

Look nigga, I suggest you go home
'Cause I won't hesitate to let the chrome touch ya
Nigga, I'm never scared like Bone Crusher
Stand alone, provide my own supper
Tell ya baby momma stop comin' around here or I'm gon' fuck her
Don't try to take up for them lames around you
He'll get shots for free like I flagrant fouled you
I'm on the road blowin' grade A haze and brown (Uh huh)
Got niggas runnin' like the KKK's around (Yea!)
My album's comin', a new year's approachin'
My buzz gettin' bigger, a few ears is open
Can your team play in the game, without you there to coach 'em?
There's a very fine line between a pool and a ocean
Sometimes I'm in Atlanta where they Bankhead bounce
And you could come, but after you give Banks head, bounce (Bounce)
These niggas really want war, 'cause if so put on your vest
'Cause all you gotta do is say yes

General, I salute you
I put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you

G-Unit's like the Firm 'cause you get in, you can't get out
Feel me?
This is G-Unit life right here, know I'm sayin'
We used to sell drugs, you know bust guns and all that but now we're chillin' we're laid back, now we doin' us, we live it up
