That's ordinary, this excellence
When I fuck up, I correct the shit
Let security come get this bitch
My nigga, I said come get this bitch
Tryna shine with my diamonds shinin'
They say they're grindin', no, never mind it
That's ordinary, that Burberry
Fuck what it costs, we don't rock that shit
That new Rolls ain't new me
6 months ago, I got that shit
You know a nigga a beast when I'm out on the street
Frozen cube and frozen Jesus piece
Your main ho be stalkin' me
I had to block the bitch on my IG
Posted pictures where I be
Tell other regular shit she wanna try me

Don't you hate an ordinary nigga? (I do)
Drinkin' on ordinary liquor (We don't)
Niggas spendin' ordinary money
We don't ever fuck with basic bitches (That sounds crazy)
Your bitch got on ordinary heels (Boy what you doin'?)
Can't tell you how ordinary feels
I pull, I pull any girl and she's with it
I'ma hook her up with other bitches

Hot boy with cold cash
Check out my N.O. swag
Nothin' fresher than toe tags
When I pull the trigger at your ass
Rap niggas got no chance
I ain't even go in my bag
Run through the paper like a notepad
What you know about it with your broke ass?
All my mind irregular
All you smoke is regular
And your ho too regular
Find a runway, go step it up
I do this on the regular
Basis, you basic
Same shit, you ordinary
Damn these hoes need a mortuary, uuh

Stepped the game up and tip the bitch
The niggas you was with ain't use to shit
I put 10 bands in her hand
Then sent her home to her man
She said, "Don't you hate an ordinary nigga?"
Pour up a four, I ain't drinkin' on ordinary liquor
This syrup, Ferragamo belt holdin' up my Levi britches
Forreal, I look like drug money, but I keep my bitch ridiculous
I said "Baby, I'm the realest, even though I'm not the richest"
I'm still gonna bet 50 these 50 racks; my ho' the biggest
What you wanna do? We all got bands
He ordinary - ordinary
Whoa, ordinary - ordinary
Ordinary, ordinary
Whoa, ordinary - ordinary

Don't think I'ma chose
Kickin' back, foreign shoes
Watch me make and break all the rules
Do all the moves
I carry you out of your dream, feel me out, I'm on steam
Please, I'm out of your league
Visa's found in my jeans
These 2014's
Please deny to your fiends
Normal walls, I ain't been, all my girls, you a ten
Thank the Lord I ain't them
In the store, I ain't spend
Spendin' time to get me nowhere
I'm mismatchin' the whole year
Peace sign to 'em like "Later"
Countin' these stacks when the slip clear

She shop on cloud 9, live on Saks 5th
Her closet game on some Kim Kardash shit
Draft night, she lookin' for a first round pick
Shorty think I'm Andrew Wiggins, tryna fuckin' hit
The nothin' in her lifestyle basic
Canary Islands, black sand and Chanel slips
I said this girl is extraordinary
Monster Ball the movie, get to fuckin', she like Halle Berry
Don't you hate an ordinary nigga? (I do)
Drinkin' on ordinary liquor (We don't)
Niggas spendin' ordinary money
We don't ever fuck with basic bitches (That sounds crazy)
Your bitch got on ordinary heels (Boy what you doin'?)
Can't tell you how ordinary feels
I pull, I pull any girl and she's with it
