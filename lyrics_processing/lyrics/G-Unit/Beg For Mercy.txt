Yeah
G-G-G
G-G-G
G-Unit
No peace talks, no white flags
No mercy, I get in yo' ass

Niggas done heard about my clique how we stay with the toastas
Blood in, blood out, La Cosa Nostra
You don't wanna bang with the best
I'll have Doc removin' fragments from your chest
They say God's a forgivin' man, I hope he forgive
Pray shells I let off don't curse my kid
They say 50 done blew up, 50 you changed, nigga
You stunt, I pull out and you see I'm that same nigga
That Ruger start to roar, iron is flyin'
Eight outta eight on movin' targets
You run, you still dyin'
Check my resume, I am oh so loco
Mama ain't raise no chump, I don't talk to po-po

Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin' for a jux
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks
Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin' for a jux
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks

There once was some niggas that tried to merk me
I hit 'em up, put 'em in plastic surgery
This fo-five don' made a lot of guys apologize
The truth come out, 'stead of hearin' a lot of lies
Some niggas catch a case and then claim they hard
A couple chest wounds'll make a nigga change his heart
I just play my part, and while you shootin' up cars
I'm smokin' niggas like a Cuban cigar
Let's get it poppin'

Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin' for a jux
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks
Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin' for a jux
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks

I'm tired of you niggas with your maybe beef
We gon' be here forever, you're temporary like baby teeth
I'm in and out the night clubs, eighty deep
Dark blue Benz, navy seats, eighty sneaks
These niggas tellin' out the blue
So you hang 'em off the bridge, police'll have to helicopter you
The Jimmy lived in the bags, the Bellhop will do
I rap for the neighborhood niggas that failed in high school
You can tell I came a long way in my sense, home grown
That's why them little niggas in the projects love me
You provide the beat downs for free, I paid my dues
I don't even freestyle for free
I gave 'em a break, flew over seas
But it's kinda hard to get homie-sick when there's blue in the trees
Sit back and try to play your role
The doctors'll put more staples in yo' ass than a telephone pole
Yeah!
Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin' for a jux
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks
Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin' for a jux
