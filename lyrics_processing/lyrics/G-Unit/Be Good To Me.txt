You gotta love it
(You got to be good to me)
Yeah, you gotta figure out how to make me feel special
(I'm gonna be good to you)
And I'll be good to you
I'll treat you how you need to be treated
(You got to be good to me)
You got to be all I need you to be, baby
Damn (I'm gonna be good to you)
And I'll make you feel like, oh my god

I'm a 360 nigga, seven thirty all the way dirty
I got that burner on me now, you heard me?
Tasted the good life twice, rap and shootin' dice
Hell naw, I ain't put my head between her legs
Smell the leather, feel the wood grain, bitch, I'm rollin'
In a Bentley continental, see bitch, I'm haulin'
You got to want to win like I want to win and do things my way
If not, I'll put your ass out on the highway
(Damn) I'm a bad judge of character, I know that shit
Man, time don't fly when you fuck with the wrong bitch
I mean damn, why you come to me, bitch?
What you want from me, bitch?
You're like the boogeyman, your hauntin' me, bitch
I give you money, you spend that, and come back
Like you need a new stack
I'm puzzled now, how the fuck you blow that?
You got a nigga on the side? Well you should have him full time
Go fuck up his shit instead of mine
You might also like
Go on, get, punk bitch
(You got to be good to me)
I don't need you round here, no way
A mufuckin' headache, you understand what I'm saying
(I'm gonna be good to you)
Look, my motherfuckin' head hurts right now 'cause of your punk ass
Bitch, why don't you find something constructive to do?
(You got to be good to me)
You know, kill yourself
G-Go on kill yourself
(I'm gonna be good to you)
Go on to the bathroom, open the cabinet, and eat the pills

She love you when your paper thick
It look like you're makin' it
In and out the town fresh, Audi R8'ing it
Freak Fest, South Beach, Mardi Gras tapin' it
In the club ballin' on my party hard Laker shit
(Damn) V.I.P.'ing on her, you ain't even got a place to sit
Smokin' piff, you'll cough, every time you take a hit (Who Kidd)
Well, mama got me stuck, look how she shake her hips
She ain't used to this shit but I'm a make it fit (Damn)
She lost her sex drive, she wants a new one
I'll do you one better, I won't cum 'til you cum
A joint account'll turn one bum to two bums
Dealin' with a chick that can't even walk and chew gum
Money don't solve the problem, it prolongs it
You don't want things to get better, you just want shit
Ain't nobody happy 'bout me and you, they all sick
Bitch, you had swagger, but mine reinforced it (Damn, nigga)
Everything you had lost it
Man, you should be happy you got rid of that bitch, man
(You got to be good to me)
She wasn't even worth the shoes she walked out in
(I'm gonna be good to you)
I know you want the muhfuckin' shoes back
Them muhfuckers were hot, man
I ain't gon' front
I'm finna tell my bitch
(You got to be good to me)
"Man, you need to get you a pair of those shoes man, Banks said those bitches lookin' good" (Tony Yayo)
(I'm gonna be good to you)
I'm a real nigga, you don't need that bitch, nigga, look how much money you got, nigga

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's super nigga
With five acres and a mule and the coupe is bigger (Damn)
You gon' trick on that ho? You a stupid nigga
I'm a P.I.M.P., not Cupid, nigga
Ho pimpin' all day, bitch, this ain't a hobby
My name Tony, not Paul McCartney
I'm in a 7-star suite, dutchin' my haze
Remote in my hand, model bitch on my mate
Baby girl want Chloe and Fendi spars
She wanna fly to L.A. and live like a star
She wanna eat lobster and caviar
But we eat Burger King and we fuck in the car
I'll be far from your friend and your lover
I hit a bitch off, drop her off, and burn rubber
Pull out the rubber, can't get a dime
It's bad enough Uncle Sam trying to take mine
Shit
Damn, nigga
A bitch can't even get a pair of shoes
(You got to be good to me)
Man, you ain't gon' be able to keep no bitch like that, man
(I'm gonna be good to you)
I'm tellin' you, I started out the same way
I mean, even in the projects
(You got to be good to me)
Bitch didn't pay attention for all that
Know what I'm talkin' about?
(I'm gonna be good to you)
I started out like that too
Now I buy 'em whatever they want
Haha
