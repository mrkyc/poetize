The goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the street car line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven in a little row boat
Clap pat, clap pat, clap pat
Clap, clap, clap pat
Clap your hand, pat it on your partners hand
Right hand
Clap pat, clap your hand cross it with your left arm
Pat your partners left palm
Clap pat, clap your hand pat your partners right palm
With your right palm again
Clap slap
Slap your hands, slap your thigh
And sing a little song, go
My mother told me if I was goody
That she would buy me a rubber dolly
My auntie told her, I kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me, a rubber dolly
Three, six, nine
The goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the street car line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven in a little row boat

Cross your right arm with your left arm

Take your right arm, cross your left arm
Pat your partners right palm with your right palm

And slap your thighs
And watch the fun materialize
As you sing this little song
My mother told me
If I was goody
A that she would buy me
A rubber dolly
My auntie told her
I kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me
A rubber dolly
