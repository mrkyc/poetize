(Christmas)

Light the lights, ring the chimes
Come on Iin, It's party time
Raise a glass for Auld Lang Syne
Come on, 'n' rock it up for all mankind
Good to see friends I know
Kissing under the mistletoe
I love to hear the children sing
It looks like Santa's gonna bring

(Another Rock 'n' Roll Christmas)
Another Christmas Rock 'n' Roll
Presents hanging from the tree
You'll never guess what you've got from me
Another Rock 'n' Roll Christmas
Another Christmas Rock 'n' Roll
We better hold each other tight
You never know it might snow tonight
You might also like
Guys and gals stay up late
So excited they can't wait
Let there be peace on Earth
Come on and Rock 'n' Roll for all your worth
We're gonna laugh (ha!)
We're gonna sing
We're gonna make the rafters ring
Pull my cracker
Let me be
The silver star upon your tree

(Another Rock 'n' Roll Christmas)
Another Christmas Rock 'n' Roll
All dressed up so here we go
Do I hear sleigh bells in the snow?
(Another Rock 'N' Roll Christmas)
Another Christmas Rock 'N' Roll
Tonight old Santa never never stops
He bops above the chimney tops
And you'll be rockin' in your stockin'
When you see your big surprise
'Cause I'll be rockin' in your stockin'
You won't believe your big blue eyes

Come on in, join the fun
It's Christmas time for everyone
May your days be merry and bright
This ain't gonna' be no silent night
See the stars a-glittering
Soon they're gonna see the New Year in
No one's lookin', kiss me quick
Come on and rock 'n' roll for ol' Saint Nick

(Another Rock 'n' Roll Christmas)
Another Christmas Rock 'n' Roll
Presents hangin' from the tree
You'll never guess what you've got from me
(Another Rock 'n' Roll Christmas)
Another Christmas Rock 'n' Roll
We better hold each other tight
You never know it might snow tonight

It's Christmas
(Another Rock 'n' Roll Christmas)

All dressed up so here we go

Tonight old Santa never never stops
