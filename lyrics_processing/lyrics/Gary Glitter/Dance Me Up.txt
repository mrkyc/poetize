Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls
I feel the beat, I can't wait any longer
I feel the heat of bodies on the floor
Baby when it's hot, it gets me so excited
Bring me to the spot, I can't take it any more
So leave me right in the middle of the action
I've been watching it long enough, so
(Bring on the girls) Bring on the girls
(Bring on the girls) Bring on the girls
Bring on the good for nothing but loving girls
And dance, dance, dance, dance me up
Dance, dance, dance, dance me up
It's over the top and then a little higher
Make my body pop so my feet don't touch the ground
I ain't gonna stop until you light my fire
You can dance me up but you'll never dance me down
'Cause I'm a man and my temperature is rising
I've been lonely long enough so
You might also like(Bring on the girls) Bring on the girls
(Bring on the girls) Bring on the girls
Bring on the good for nothing but loving girls
And dance, dance, dance, dance me up
Dance, dance, dance, dance me up
Bring on the dancing girls (I demand to find a friend)
Bring on the dancing girls
Bring on the dancing girls (I can't go wrong, I'm on)
Bring on the dancing girls
I'm the one in the middle of the action
I've been watching it long enough, so
(Bring on the girls) Bring on the girls
(Bring on the girls) Bring on the girls
Bring on the good for nothing but loving girls
And dance, dance, dance, dance me up
Dance, dance, dance, dance me up
Dance, dance, dance, dance me up
Dance, dance, dance, dance me up
Wanna take you higher
Dance, dance, dance, dance me up
Take me higher, higher
