Somethin' about the Southside
That makes me wanna act bad
Swangin' up 
Flossin' my candy slab

 mastermind, aggravated with heat, blazin a sweet
Sippin' syrup and the wine is cheap
The game is deep, but I can't say the game don't pay
You better buy some property and put your money away
I ball every day just fly
Smoke chunky down to pieces
And come through my hood in brand new 
To each his own, the fullest 3 to the 2
Keeping it true and gone off a stick of coo-coo
Player made to the fullest but partner, I really ain't trippin'
Cause everybody know I got that low-low on the chickens
Living lavish, having cabbage with love world wide
Just some about the Southside that keep me crunk inside, nigga

Somethin' about the Southside
That makes me wanna act bad
Swangin' up 
Flossin' my candy slab
You might also like
Rippin' the grass
 remain the same
Life is fame and gettin' a name
Caught up in this crooked game
Livin' like real
Doin' what I feel
Tryna get up and over the hill
Makin' my meal
Packin' my steel
Prayin' to the lord I don't get killed
Cookin' up cheese
All these days of livin' in sin
Will I rise up or down in the pen
In my face another 
Will this bullshit ever end
Everyday all day I stay high
Smokin' that weed and chocolate thai
Chop em all up and write dem up
Watchin' the haters pass me by
I don't mind, high till I die
They can't really see
It's the L to the I to the L
And a playa named 3
Somethin' about the Southside
That makes me wanna act bad
Swangin' up 
Flossin' my candy slab

Baby catch me on the highway
Bangin', puffin' a blunt
Comin' down, surrounded by sound
Wit a big daddy grill in the front
Watchin' TV, I know ya see me
Wit the top down groovin
Swervin lane to lane barely movin
The game so smoothe and
These hoes is choosin' (me)
Original Southside playa
That's straight from Houston
Texas, Rollie, Lexus, Suburban
Catch me swervin'
Walk around dem then hit the curb and
I'm high on herb and
My niggas is hurtin' in the South
Knowin' I'm talkin' to ma
Recognize game and pimp conversation
Comin' from a mile
Ridin slab every day
Breakin' up concrete
Somethin' about the Southside
That makes me wanna act bad
Swangin' up 
Flossin' my candy slab

Well deep down in the south
We ride candy cars
Benzes, Jaguars, like some of these stars
Beware, just cuz, a nigga true to the game
I cock the hammer back
And put one in your brain
Who me?
Lil Ke', I represent at all costs
Get lost tryna floss
And but heads wit the boss
Later lost in these lyrics
Make you fear when hearin' it
Smokin' skunk, poppin' trunks
And my slab on his period
Drippin' wet, hit the set
Gon' place another bet
Ain't no sweat, you in debt
Mo' money on the deck
Can't forget I'm blowin deuce
And I'm givin' niggas dat
Swang, chop em up
And I'm flossin' the slab

Somethin' about the Southside
That makes me wanna act bad
Swangin' up
