Put your stones in dust and worn, South coast raised and born
Having plex, you get broke loose and catch that Texas longhorn
Up that ass, when I blast, claimin' Southeast H-Town
Stackin' cakes stackin' paper makin' playahaters break down
If you're lookin' for an exit, cause Houston on the wreck shit
T-E-X-A-S is the state you don't mess with
Cock the TECs quick, and check shit, the best
Well respected from north to east
But connected with the west
It's the 3rd Coast creepin' 'round the corner
Rockin' birds, sippin' syrup, puffin' marijuana
Screwed Up Click roll deep and we kick it down south
Pop the lip, try to trip, hit you with the sawed off
Botany Boys bring the noise, Cloverland on the map
Bailin' through the Texas streets with my hand on my strap
Every hour on the hour pourin powder in Pyrexes
Leaving you chestless if you're vestless, don't mess wit Texas

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Texas, that's us, and in Glocks we trust, cause, uh
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Glock 9s we bust and there's no fucking wit us, cause, uh
Mark shit don't thrill me, haters wanna kill me
Lil' Keke representin' Texas, so try to feel me
Mark shit don't thrill me, haters wanna kill me
Southside Houston, Texas, so try to feel me

Cross the line at the border to this Lone Star State
And create drastic scenes Billy The Kid can't make
Bustin' sounds out in the Talon to this world-wide tower
Take myself and then I bust, the other 9 don't matter
Ain't no wustle in Calies I used to think that was slow
It's automatics that'll catch you at this Texan's front door
Lifestyles like Frank White, facin' Kapone
Stackin' cheese, takin' my keys, when you went through the zone
Tell your colleagues you won't want this
North sides took over
9 times out of 10 I'm makin' it out, I doubt it
Fairy tales and riddles, cut you sweet down the middle
Fill in with weed to succeed how I'm plottin' to kill ya
Cowboys and neeyas, gangbangers and dope slangers
Pull the Southern angle Glock 2-1 in the chamber
So Lisa Lee, to the publicist who not try test us
You find yourself restless tryin' to fuck with Texas
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Southside Houston, Texas, so try to feel me
Feel the ill, yield the yield, Texas has no fear
Strapped with full metal gear, makin' it loud and clear
Takin' advantage, you can't manage, I'm a Southside ambassador
So lay it down, or be found, as the chains of massacre
I'm askin' ya to chill, better yet try to feel
Stackin' mills down the kilo, gang related for real
Here's the deal, 9 to 10, everythang I want even
If I'm in then you spin, here's the key to the Benz
Fuck a friend in this game, cause it's all about greed
Tech 9, red beam, and a murderin' team
Yeah we're close to the border so won't you put in your order
Pound of weed, jug of water, half a chicken or quarter
Puffin' harder at the bottom cause we gainin' respect
Might check, I select, soly Texas connected
You respected Ke to hate, but I set it all straight
Brain or chest plate, it's the lonestar state
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Texas, that's us, and in Glocks we trust, cause uh
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Glock 9's we bust and there's no fucking wit us, cause uh
