Lord have mercy, momma done raised a real thug
Me and my daddy cool but he showed me tough love
Fifteen, I was assed out, getting grown
By this time, my old man had just moved on
Momma couldn't drive so she didn't have a car
And I could still see my T-lady walking' far
Sweat on her face, purse and a grocery bag
Me and my sister, shit, that's all we ever had
Stuck my chest out, became the man of the house
Now I'm the breadwinner, go get it at any cost
Flipping burgers, washing cars and cutting yards
I graduated to cooking soft and selling hard
High school is over with, I'm on a path
To more hoes, more dough and a new slab
I'm a B.G., hardheaded, so fly
But I'm a gangsta, and like this 'til I die
Know what I'm sayin'?

I say my hood is a mess, the OGs done got dressed with they red
They heard the lil' homie got wet
So them AK's spraying blood for the young blood
You know us, nigga, it's riding in us
We fly, 25's on them new trucks
We high, 'til we die, you can't see us
G4, burning purple bush or that kush
Leaning on the lean and them guns stay tucked
Stunting on them bitches, in God we trust
I inked my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Redid the new grill, iced out, block cut
Like father, like son, real niggas stand up
I'm wallpaper dawg, I hustled in the fall
Slept with the gators, rolled with guerillas
Built real niggas, a Cash Money nigga
Young Money nigga, we them real go-getters
Believe that

Fuck a diploma, I'm smothered in the dro aroma
Still on probation, if I piss, then I'm a goner
Catch a pistol case 'fore I leave it at the crib
Welcome to Herschelwood, soldiers get it how they live
A million blocks but they all end at one road
The streets a motherfucker, ride 'til the car explode
Niggas lose your vests, I'm taking head shots
Fuck a new story, evidence and subplots
Pressure bust a pipe, kept it real and stayed at it
Them old snitch niggas know the game and still ratted
I'm at the weed house with 20 bags and three-for-ten
I had a closed mind, I wasn't listening back then
Stuck in one spot tryna learn to manage money
Fuck them Air Jordans, the sky ain't forever sunny
Keep a full clip, jackers might wanna visit
I'm a G, chasing down the same meal ticket
Know what I'm sayin'? (That's right)
