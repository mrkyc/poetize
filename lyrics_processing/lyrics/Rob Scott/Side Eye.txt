Break it down
Things got complicated, can we break it down
Post up all those pictures just to take 'em down
I'll pass by your cribbo when I make my rounds
I wait around
What did I do to us
You know that I screwed up when I do too much
Quote, unquote, homeboy want me to screw this up
Now flippin' this on you, that's what the rumor was
Am I losin' us?

Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that

Break it down
Things got complicated since we broke it down
Things not looking no way that they 'sposed to now
Hittin' someone else that got you open now
I'll choke him out
Keep my secrets safe
And don't be so malicious in the things you say
Just to satisfy his insecurities
What reaction you tryna get outta me
You should be proud of me

Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Who gon' break the news?
Who gon' tell you that it's over?
Yeah I fuckin' hurt you, but ain't nothin' can't get over
Girl don't throw away all the items that I bought ya
We should be together, we should be pushin' a stroller
Fuck your side eye, I done called you nine times
Man I ain't that hot minded, I'm just runnin' outta time, yeah
Fuck apologies, bitch you told me it was over
I carried the heat, but you was always the soldier

Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Fuckin' side eye, fuckin' side eye
Why you givin' me that

Half the time, we're not even intimate
Half the time, not even into it
Half the time, we don't even mention it
Half the time, play like I'm innocent
Half the time, ain't getting into this
Half the time, don't know what she's yellin' for
Half the time, don't know why I punched that wall
Half the time, no Rollies and no Audemars
Half the time, our dinners on the kitchen floor
Half the time, I ask but I already know
I ask but I already know
'Cause you were my best material
You were my good luck charm when things went wrong
And I, I admit wasn't there for you
