JYP
And the Wonder Girls
We're back!
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Hot, hot

I know you're looking at me, why-y-y?
Can't take your eyes off me, right-ight-ight?
I know it's hard, but please, you're embarrassing me
Can't you pretend i'm not around-ound-ound?
Each time I walk around the block-ock-ock
I see the way the people stare-are-are
Everyone's head turns, following me around
Someone, please tell me what to do-o-o

I'm so hot
I try to hide it but
I'm so fine
I just can't help it, baby
I'm so cool
Somebody, help me
I'm so, so, so hot, hot
You might also like
I know I should be getting used to it by now
All this attention coming from the crowd-owd
I know they watch me, I know they want me
And they know it's not gonna chan-an-ange
Why can't I live a normal life-ife-ife?
A life just like a normal girl-irl-irl
Mommy, why did you make me so special?
It's not so easy to be hot, hot, hot

I'm so hot
I try to hide it but
I'm so fine
I just can't help it, baby
I'm so cool
Somebody, help me
I'm so, so, so hot, hot
I'm so hot
I try to hide it but
I'm so fine
I just can't help it, baby
I'm so cool
Somebody, help me
I'm so, so, so hot, hot
Everybody watching me
'Cause I'm hot, hot
Everybody wanting me
'Cause I'm hot, hot

Anytime, anywhere I go
I can never run away from the white spotlight
They never leave me alone
No matter what time it is, day or night
How old do I gotta be till they don't want me no more?
Drew Barrymore, tell me
Try to run
But I just can't hide
Started in Asia, now worldwide
Everyone loves me
Try to get to know me
What can I do?
Oh no, please leave me alone
All the boys be loving me
Girls be hating me
They will never stop
'Cause they know I'm so hot, hot

I'm so hot
I try to hide it but
I'm so fine
I just can't help it, baby
I'm so cool
Somebody, help me
