I want nobody, nobody, but you
I want nobody, nobody, but you
How can I be with another?
I don't want any other
I want nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody

Why are you trying to
To make me leave you
I know what you're thinking
Baby, why aren't you listening?
How can I just
Just love someone else and
Forgot you completely
When I know you still love me

Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know it's not right, so
Just stop and come back, boy
How can this be when we were meant to be?

I want nobody, nobody, but you
I want nobody, nobody, but you
How can I be with another?
I don't want any other
I want nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody

Why can't we just
Just be like this 'cause
It's you that I need and
Nothing else until the end
Who else can ever
Make me feel the way I
I feel when I'm with you
No one will ever do

Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know me enough, so
You know what I need, boy
Right next to you is where I'm meant to be

I want nobody, nobody, but you
I want nobody, nobody, but you
How can I be with another?
I don't want any other
I want nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody

I don't want nobody, body
I don't want nobody, body
Honey, you know
It's you that I want
It's you that I need
Why can't you see?
Would you please just stop, baby?
Stop pushing me away
'Cause I'm your lady
And it'll always be that way
No matter what it takes, I'll be by your side
Why are you trying to give up before we try?
Telling me this is all for me
I deserve a better man
So you're leaving me
You're not making any sense
Cause you know what I want, what I need (It's you)
I don't want nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, but you (You)

I want nobody, nobody, but you (You)
I want nobody (You), nobody, but you (But you)
How can i be with another?
I don't want any other
I want nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody (Nobody, nobody)

Yeah
Oh baby, yeah
Oh whoa, ooh
