JYP
And the Wonder Girls
We're back!

Watching, cause you got me patiently
Waiting, i think you are amazing
Baby It's okay, you're worth the wait
But i just can't, no more
Dreaming of you every night and i'm
Praying, will you hold me tight
And just wrap those arms around me boy
I really wanna feel you in my soul

Every time you look in my eyes
I can feel that ya just wanna say
Three little words, it's not so
Impossible then you start walking away
I can't help it i'm asking the question
I guess there's no other way
For you to just tell-me-right-now
So maybe i should say it out loud

Please be my baby, please be my baby
No, i don't wanna wonder any more boy
I gotta hear you say the words say the words, oh
Make me your lady, cause i'm going crazy
I want you and i want the world to know that
I'm your baby and i know you feel the same, yeah
You might also like
Talking, do you hear a word that i'm
Saying, i'm so tired of playing these games with you
I'm so confused, so will you be my baby
Losing my mind while your over there
Choosing, i don't wanna ruin this thing we got
Like it or not, who's baby are you wanting to be?

I can't help it i'm asking the question
I guess there's no other way
For you to just tell-me-right-now
So maybe I should say it out loud

Please be my baby, please be my baby
No, i don't wanna wonder any more boy
I gotta hear you say the words say the words, oh
Make me your lady, cause i'm going crazy
I want you and i want the world to know that
I'm your baby and i know you feel the same, yeah

I can't help it when i want it, gotta get it and it's you i want
Maybe it can happen if you let it baby
Cuz i got you on my mind, all the time
And when i see you boy you're looking fine, every time
If you would make me the only one in your life then i'd be like "Sweet" mix a little sugar with spice
Baby take a change, romance, roll the dice
What other girl's gonna ask you something this nice?
Please be my baby, please be my baby
No, i don't wanna wonder any more boy
I gotta hear you say the words say the words, oh
Make me your lady, cause i'm going crazy
I want you and i want the world to know that
