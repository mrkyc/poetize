Another Christmas, what a time
I wish I had somebody to call mine
Yes. all the carolers sing together
All through the night, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la
All the gifts sitting under the tree
They don't really mean that much to me
If only this year, I could have someone by my side
Singing fa-la-la-la-la-la-la

I hope my Christmas wish comes true
Hey Santa, do you hear me?
When underneath the mistletoe, I found you
It's a miracle, a Christmas miracle!

Oh boy, it's Christmas
Everybody singing fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Season for wishing
This year, I found somebody special
And I'm thanking you for all the joy
And making this, whoa
The best Christmas ever 'cause I found you

Snowflakes floating in the air
A Jack Frost nipping on my ear
But I'm warm and cozy with you here by my side
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
This holiday, so full of cheer
Wanna feel it even more this year
Like a reindeer, making me believe I can fly
Singing fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

And I'm thanking you for all the joy
And making this, whoa

Yeah baby, baby, found ya underneath the mistletoe
The bestest present I could get without a bow
Look at me singing, jingle bells ringing
Better get ready 'cause Santa is bringing you
And all that I wanted was you

I'm so glad my Christmas wish came true
I guess Santa really heard me
'Cause underneath the mistletoe, I found you
It's a miracle, a Christmas miracle!
