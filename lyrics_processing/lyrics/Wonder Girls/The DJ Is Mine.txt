Yeah
You are now listening to
The Wonder Girls

He is mine
I'm the only thing on his mind
He thinks about me all the time
He got my love on rewind

Nobody treats him like Ii do
There's no party, I'm not in the booth
My sound keeps his heart in tune, like
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-dum-dum
He loves me, and I love him too
He plays me all the night through
He keeps me spinning and grinning
I'm winning him over from you, singing
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Everyday (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
He sings with me (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
He knows me, he holds me from intro to fade

Even though you keep giving him the eye
