If you wanna know about the blues
And the southern blood
You gotta get your feets down in the delta mud
If you wanna know where I'm comin' from
Just cross that bridge into Memphis son
Hear that sound of joy and hurt
Risin' up from the front porch to the church

From the cotton fields of Arkansas
Down the mighty MississippI
To the mardi gras
Let me hear you yell
From the country to the city
Gimme that deep down funkabilly
Hey ey ey ey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey ey ey ey

Spreadin' like kudzu across the south
Got a groove everybody's tryin' to figure it out
Juke joint, honky tonk, back woods shack
And whatever they serve
Will keep you comin' on back
Yay
You might also like
Ya'll full of country rhythm and blues
It ain't nothin' but a southern girl's
Showin' off her roots

From the cotton fields of arkansas
Down the mighty MississippI
To the mardi gras
Let me hear you yell
From the country to the city
Gimme that deep down funkabilly
Hey ey ey ey ey ey ey

(Gimme that deep down funkabilly
Hey ey ey ey ey ey ey
Gimme that deep down funkabilly)

No use hidin' who you are
I can travel 'round the whole wide world
But I'll never get too far

From the cotton fields of Arkansas
Down the mighty MississippI
To the mardi gras
Let me hear you yell
From the country to the city
From the cotton fields of Arkansas
Down the mighty MississippI
To the mardi gras
Let me hear you yell
From the country to the city
Gimme that deep down funkabilly
Hey ey ey ey ey ey ey

Gimme that deep down funkabilly
Hey ey ey ey ey ey ey
I say gimme that deep down funkabilly

Sink your feet down in the mud
Back where I come from
C'mon gimme that deep down funkabilly
Feel the deep down delta rhythm that I love
Gimme that deep down funkabilly

I'll be rollin' like a freight train to your city
Good golly miss molly I got the funkabilly
I say, I got the funkabilly
