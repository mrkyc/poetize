Da sad song
Wi don't have, wi don't have clothes
Wi don't have, wi don't have food
Wi don't have, no jobs
Wow mi a go send my youths gone school
Ghetto youths need help
Society mi see seh you nuh care
Di system gi wi more than we can bear
Life don't fear
Where is the love society
You destroy the ghetto fambily
Promise without no guarantee
Wi just can't badda wid dat no more
Di same bread fi yuh di same fi mi
While women dem live inna luxury
Dem waan wi born and dead inna poverty
Wi just can't badda with dat no more
Wi have it hard yeah
Ghetto youth but wi neva fall, down
Sell some herb, build up a stall
Through gone work now run at all noo
Mek wi circle gericho wall
Inna di mental not the physical cah
Den done send nuff a wi inna di cemetery
Yo nuff a wi behind di prison wall
Inna my scheme weh mi come from
Everyday a di same ting
Nuttn nah gwaan
Lord a weh dem go do fi Big Yard
This yah a nuh no love song it is a sad song
Inna my scheme weh mi come from
Everyday a di same ting
Nuttn nah gwaan
Lord a weh dem go do fi Big Yard
This yah a nuh no love song it is a sad song
Where is the love society
You destroy the ghetto fambily
Promise without no guarantee
Wi just can't badda wid dat no more
Di same bread fi yuh di same fi mi
While women dem live inna luxury
Dem waan wi born and dead inna poverty
Wi just can't badda with dat no more
Pree di war and pree di vibes, dem nuh want di youths survive
Dem nuh believe inna saving a life
Church and state a mash wi up
Den tell wi bout believe inna Christ
While we nuh gaze dem raise the price
Dem tell wi lies and lies how wi dem victimize mi cyan believe
Inna my scheme weh mi come from
Everyday a di same ting
Nuttn nah gwaan
Lord a weh dem go do fi Big Yard
This yah a nuh no love song it is a sad song
Inna my scheme weh mi come from
Everyday a di same ting
Nuttn nah gwaan
Lord a weh dem go do fi Big Yard
This yah a nuh no love song it is a sad song
Where is the love society
You destroy the ghetto fambily
Promise without no guarantee
Wi just can't badda wid dat no more
Di same bread fi yuh di same fi mi
While women dem live inna luxury
Dem waan wi born and dead inna poverty
