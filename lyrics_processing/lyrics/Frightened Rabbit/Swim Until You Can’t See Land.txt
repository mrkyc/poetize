I salute at the threshold
Of the North Sea of my mind
And I nod to the boredom
That drove me here to face the tide

And I swim
I swim, oh swim

Dip a toe in the ocean
Oh, how it hardens and it numbs
The rest of me is a version of man
Built to collapse in crumbs
And if I hadn't come now
To the coast to disappear
I may have died in a landslide
Of rocks and hopes and fears

So I swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
You might also likeSwim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?


Up to my knees now
Do I wade? Do I dive?
The sea has seen my like before
Though it's my first and perhaps last time
Let's call me a baptist
Call this a drowning of the past
She is there on the shoreline
Throwing stones at my back

So I swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?

And the water is taller than me
And the land is a marker line
All I have is a body
Adrift in water, salt and sky

So I swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Swim until you can't see land
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?

Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
Are you a man? Are you a bag of sand?
