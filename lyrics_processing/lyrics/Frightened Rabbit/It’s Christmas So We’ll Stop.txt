Ah, it's Christmas so we'll stop
It's on with the lights to warm the dark
It can cloak elsewhere
As the rot stops for today
Let the rot stop just for one day
Only good red eyes, red suits
And faces will radiate
And the cold will hide its face
Now the cold has turned away
We can be best friends with the people we hate
'Cause we've all got blood
And it's warmer than you'd think
Yeah, it is warm and it is thick
We all breathe out clouds
We're built to give at least once each year
And that's better than never I guess
And life might never get better than this
With the perfect excuse for our natures to change
And wear shiny clothes
Ah, it's Christmas, so press pause on the remote
You might also like
Ah, it's Christmas so we'll stop
'Cause the wine on our breath puts the love in our tongues
So forget the names
I called you on Christmas Eve
In fact forget the entire year
Don't reflect, just pretend and you won't feel scared
You won't feel a thing
'Cause it's all been tucked away
And once you're tucked in bed
You'll hug onto the day for the last few seconds
Your cradled face
Is protected from the wind
And I'll protect you, I promise I will
And the rest of our lives will be just like Christmas
With fewer toys
You're a good girl and I'm a good boy, or so I thought

Oh it's Christmas so we stopped
Were it not for the tick of the clock
And the spin of the Earth in space
We could always be this way
And as we sleep at the fall of the day
In the room next door
As a tree light brightens a rodent's eye
Catches a glimpse of the dust beginning to rise

The next day life went back to its bad self
The next day life went back to its bad self
The next day life went back to its bad self
