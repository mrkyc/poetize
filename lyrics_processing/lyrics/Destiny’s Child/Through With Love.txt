I gave my heart to you
I gave up my friends like you said I should do
Put aside my smile for you
And threw up my dreams if you said you didn't approve
I gave my mind, compromised my life
Just to see I'd find
You were trying to hold me back
Slowly throwin' me off of my track
Disappointed again

I'm through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past (Past)
For love I never had (Had)
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm finally giving it up

Oh, there you go comparin' me
To every little model on the TV screen
Oh, there you go complainin' to me
'Cause I wanna spend time with my family
My esteem has gone down
You never wanna take me out
You make me feel dumb, and alone
I don't know where to go
I'm through with it
You might also like
I'm through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past (Past)
For love I never had (Had)
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm finally giving it up

I shared all my secrets with you
And even when it hurt, I told the truth
I paralyzed my growth for you
I gave you control, felt so helpless without you
Couldn't be a friend to anyone happy
'Cause with you, I see misery loves company
Don't know if this is love
'Cause if it's love, I don't want it anymo'
I'm through with it

I'm through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it (So tired of cryin')
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it (I'm so tired of your lyin')
Love, I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past (Past)
For love I never had (Had)
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it
Love, I'm through with it, through with it
Love, I'm finally giving it up
Why do I feel so empty?
I'm crying out for some stability
Destroy my many insecurities
I'm breaking down, somebody pray for me
Need a love like no other, not an ordinary love
Restore my joy, wisdom and courage
Lord, I need your love
I found a new love
I found a new, found a new love
I finally found it in God

I found a new love
I found a new, found a new love (I don't have to hurt no more)
I found a new, found a new love (I don't have to weep no more)
I found a new, found a new love (My heart don't have to hurt no more)
I finally found it in God
I've given so much in the past (Past)
For a love I always had (Had)
I found a new
I, I found a new love
I found a new, found a new love
