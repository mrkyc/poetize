Second nature
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, hey-hey
Second nature

Why does our love always seem so very hard?
It's such a struggle, to win the reward
Because we're playin' with the wrong cards
But I think I've got the winnin' hand
There's something different about you, babe
That tells me I can
I say it's easy for the things that I do
Never a question, always a pleasure to
Love you, love you, love you

Baby, I won't say no
The love that you give is so
I'm hooked and I can't let go of this love

It's so natural
So natural to give my love
It's so easy (Easy like)
Second nature, second nature
It's so natural
So natural to give my love
Like no other (Simple like)
Second nature, second nature
You might also like
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey (Ooh... hey, baby, baby)
Ooh, ooh, hey-hey

Thinkin' of you is the breath that I take
Just for your love, I can't wait
I could never think twice
It wakes me up in the mornin'
And in the middle of the night
And with a smile on my face
I'm ready

Baby, I won't say no (Won't say no)
The love that you give is so (Give is so)
I'm hooked and I can't let go of this love

It's so natural
So natural to give my love (Give you my love)
It's so easy
Second nature, second nature (Second nature)
It's so natural
So natural to give my love
Like no other (I know, I know)
Second nature, second nature (Oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-ooh)
It's so natural (Oh, baby, baby)
So natural to give my love (It's so natural)
It's so easy (To give you every bit of my love)
Second nature, second nature
It's so natural (It's so natural)
So natural to give my love (To give you all of my love)
Like no other
Second nature, second nature (Ooh, oh)
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, hey-hey...
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Hey, hey) Second nature
(It's so natural, baby
To give you all of me) Second nature
Second nature (And if you want it, then you got it)
Second nature
(Baby) Second nature
(Ooh) Ooh-whoa (Oh)
Second nature (Second nature, hey)
Second nature (Nature, oh-oh)
Second nature (Second nature, hey)
(Second nature, oh)
Second nature (Second nature, hey)
