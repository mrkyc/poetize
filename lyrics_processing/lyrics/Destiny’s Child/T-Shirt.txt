Hey, baby
I wish you could see what I have on right now
You so sexy
Imagine how intense it would be
To hold me right now
Our song's playin'

At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt flow with my body
I can still hear your baritone in my ear
Tellin' me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playin' roles
Like you were here, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearin' the same old song playin' (Oh)

Give it to me deeper (Oh)
Givin' me the fever (Oh)
Now you got my feet up, this one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playin' (Oh)
Oh, we tried to stand up (Oh)
Hold me while my hands up (Oh)
And the music kicks off, fantasies were shook up
I'm thinkin' to myself again
You might also like
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (To take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

Outside I hear the rain on my window pane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playin' tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that my baby home?
Why couldn't it be reality?
Looked at the clock and it says 4:03
At nine, he'll be arrivin' on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearin' the song again (Oh)

Give it to me deeper (Oh)
You're givin' me the fever (Oh)
Now you got my feet up, this one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playin' (Oh)
Oh, we tried to stand up (Oh)
Hold me while my hands up (Oh)
And the music kicks off, fantasies were shook up
I'm thinkin' to myself again
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (To take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne (Oh, oh, oh)

Ooh, boy, I've been waitin' (Oh, oh, oh)
Got my body shakin' (Oh, oh, oh)
You're so deep, baby, please take it easy (Oh, oh, oh)
I look at your face and (Oh, oh, oh)
Got my heart racin' (Oh, oh, oh)
You're so deep, baby, please take it easy

Keep it right there
Oh, wait, wait
Yeah, keep it right there
You driving me crazy
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (To take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

Oh, oh, oh
