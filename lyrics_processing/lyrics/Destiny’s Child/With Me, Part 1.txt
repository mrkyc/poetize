Uh, uh, come on
Uh, everything you like is with me
So, if you know like I know (Oh)
This is where you need to be

Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone, leaves you alone? (He's with me)
Do you ever wonder when he (He)
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night (Yeah, yeah)
He leaves you alone (Yeah)
Then everything he likes is with me

If I was in your shoes, I would've had to let him know
From the first sign of him tryin' to play
If you want me to stay, you gotta let all that go
Oh, but no, you wanna stick around
And not believe in what you see
And while you're waitin', thinkin' everything's gonna be okay
I got him, I got him right here with me (Oh, oh)
You might also like
Do you ever wonder when he (Oh, oh)
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone, leaves you alone? (He's with me)
Do you ever wonder when he (Ay, hey)
Don't come home, who he goes to see?
And why in the middle of the night (Yeah)
He leaves you alone
Then everything he likes is with me

I wanna call you so bad
And tell you where it started and what we do
How long it's been going on and why he ain't gon' never come home
'Cause I know what you didn't do to make him stay
See, a bad-performing, unfulfilling woman drives a man away

Do you ever wonder when he (Do you ever wonder?)
Don't come home, who he goes to see? (Hey, hey)
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone, leaves you alone? (He's with me)
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see? (Home)
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone (Hey, oh)
Then everything he likes is with me
Now, as far as I know
He's in good hands
So, you can stop callin' all around
Sayin', "Have you seen my man?" (Have you seen my man?)
Ain't no need to fuss and fight
Tryin' to make it right (No)
Certain things ain't meant to be
And that's why, that's why, he's right here with me

Everything you like is with me
So, if you know like I know, this is where you need to be
(Right here with me)
Everything you like is with me
So, if you know like I know, this is where you need to be
(He's right here with me)
Everything you like is with me
So, if you know like I know, this is where you need to be
(Right here with me)
Everything you like is with me
So, if you know like I know, this is where you need to be
(Right here with me)

(Do you wonder?)
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see? (Come home)
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone, leaves you alone? (Don't you know he's with me?)
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home, who he goes to see? (Oh)
And why in the middle of the night
He leaves you alone
Then everything he likes is with me
Everything he likes with me (Do you ever wonder when he)
Everything he likes with me
And everything he likes, everything he likes (The middle of the night, he leaves you alone)
Everything, everything he likes with me (Leaves you alone)
Everything he likes with me (Do you ever wonder when he)
Everything he likes with me
Everything, everything, everything (The middle of the night, he leaves you alone)
