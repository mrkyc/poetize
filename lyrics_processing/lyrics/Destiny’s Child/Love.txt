It had been many years since I'd been in love
With a real man, I had given up on love
I didn't think a good man existed in this world
I was tired of searching
Because relationships I dealt with in the past
Couldn't fathom being monogamous
And when I least expected it, I found you
And because of you, I know how it feels to be in love

And when I look into your eyes, I see love
We pillow-talk at night and I can hear your love
Ooh, the next morning, we make love
I'm so in love

Through you, I live and love again, yeah
Open the path to happiness, yeah
Through you, I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you, I live and love again, yeah
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand, yeah
Through you, I learned to smile again
I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)

Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doin' things to show you're proud of
Thirty beauties in the room, only me you see
The confidence you give lives in me
I vow to never break your heart, I'll never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here to share, my life's so complete
And because of you, I know how it feels to be in love

And when I look into your eyes, I see love
We pillow-talk at night and I can hear your love
Ooh, the next morning, we make love
I'm so in love

Through you, I live and love again, yeah
Open the path to happiness, yeah
Through you, I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you, I live and love again, yeah
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand, yeah
Through you, I learned to smile again
I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
(I thank God for you, ooh!)
Your love's amazing
And like the rain, it fell on me (Fell on me)
Wanting it more and more
'Cause your love's in the air I breathe
Lying beside me
You see into the soul of me (See into the soul of me)
And your spirit sets me free

Through you, I live and love again, yeah (Yeah)
Open the path to happiness, yeah (Yeah-hey, yeah)
Through you, I learned to smile again
I thank God for you (I thank God for you)
Through you, I live and love again, yeah (Through you, I live and love again)
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand, yeah (Put my trust in you)
Through you, I learned to smile again
I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
Through you, I live and love again, yeah (You make me feel)
Open the path to happiness, yeah (So loved)
Through you, I learned to smile again
I thank God for you (God made me for you)
Through you, I live and love again, yeah (Ooh, yeah)
