There are times I find it hard
To sleep at night
We are living through
Such troubled times
And every child that reaches out
For someone to hold
For one moment
They become my own

And how can I pretend that I don't know
What's going on?
When every second and every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe
That in my life I will see (Oh yeah)
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up, or suffering (Yeah)
If we all stand
Together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love
You might also like
I'm inspired and hopeful
Each and everyday
That's how I know
That things are gonna change

So how can I pretend that I don't know
What's going on?
When every second, with every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe
That in my life I will see (I will see, yeah, yeah)
An end to hopelessness (Hopelessness)
Or giving up (Giving up), or suffering (Suffering, yeah-yeah, yeah)
If we all stand (Stand)
Together this one time (Together this, time)
When no one will get left behind (When no one will)
Stand up for life (Life)
Stand up for love

(Life, life, yeah, yeah)
And it all starts right here, yeah
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
And it starts right now
One person stand up, and
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
And the rest will follow
(Yeah) For all the forgotten
(Yeah) For all the unloved
I'm gonna sing this song (I'm gonna sing this song)
And I believe
That in my life I will see, yes (See, yeah, yes)
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up, or suffering
If we all stand
Together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and sing, yeah
Stand up for love

For love
