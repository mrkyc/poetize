Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind?
'Cause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you "What's the deal?"
You hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
'Cause, boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
To come and get my love, it's all here for you

You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" (No, no)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Yeah)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" (Oh yeah)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (You're tellin' me no)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" (No, no, no)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" (Oh, yeah)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Oh, yeah)

If you keep acting this way, you're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play, you better hurry up
'Cause every time I come around and cruise around your way
I see you on the corner, but you don't know what to say
And when I walk up to you, babe, you seem so shy
What's the problem, baby? Never had a girl like I?
I can see right through you, and you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together, 'cause you're runnin' out of time

You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no," (Oh, oh)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" (No, ooh)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Don't you know)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" (You tell me, "No, baby, no, baby, no, baby?")
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no," (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby)

(Just say yes)
You won't regret, I must confess
I'm really feelin' you
Anything you ever wanted before
Is right here for you, for you
Don't worry what they say
Just bring your love my way
'Cause your friends can't do what I can for you
I don't wanna hear you say it, oh
(No)
Baby, tell me
(Yes)
Tell me, yes
Don't tell me no, no (No)
(Yes)
Say yeah, say yeah...
(You be sayin', "No")
Don't tell me no, no
(When it's really, "Yes")
Tell me what I wanna hear, yeah, yeah
(You be sayin', "No")
Y-E-S, not N-O
(When it's really, "Yes")
Oh-ooh, oh

You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no," (You make me say no, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no," (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no," (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
