It's your birthday
You don't have to do nothing

The time has come, and it's finally here
Have a candlelit dinner
Or just settle down, my dear
Whatever you like, boy
Its all up to you
We can celebrate, baby
'Cause-

It's your birthday

Now close your eyes, babe
And listen to the melody
Anything you want, my sweet
Just ask me
It's the day for us to share
So leave your problems up to me
Let's start, you and me
And make this day history

I'm sending out invitations
To let all your friends know that (It's your birthday)
But all that I really wanna do
Is wrap you up and get in the groove
And keep you all to myself (It's your birthday)

Now the mood is right now
And you don't have to fantasize
All your dreams could come true
But it's up to you
If you can't decide, boy
Just give me all your mind (I've got a surprise)
A present that you'll like

We gon' celebrate (You and me)
