I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much, child
Don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are

I've always been so nice to you, girl
Helpin' you girl, there for you girl
You always tried to compete with me, girl
Usin' me girl, abusin' me girl
Flirtin' with every man you see
Especially if the man likes me
Baby, where's your self esteem?
Find your own identity

Your head ain't right
No congratulating schemer
Your head ain't right
You's a liar and a cheater
And I don't want you, I don't want you, I don't want you no more
Don't come knockin' at my door
I don't know what you came here for
If you didn't know, then now you know
You might also like

I don't fancy you too much, child
Don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are

Roll those eyes, girl, twist them hips, girl
Swing that handle in the air
If you wonder why you never had a girlfriend
I think I made myself clear
Girl, change your ways right now, today
Stop hatin' me, baby, find your own identity

Your head ain't right
No congratulating schemer
Your head ain't right
You's a liar and a cheater
And I don't want you, I don't want you, I don't want you no more
Don't come knockin' at my door

If you didn't know, then now you know
I don't fancy you too much, child

Girlfriend
Lord knows that I've tried
No matter how much I give to you
You wanna use me for what I got
You take my kindness for weakness
You take advantage of people
One day you shall reap what you sow
