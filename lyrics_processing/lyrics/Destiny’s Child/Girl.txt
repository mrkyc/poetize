Take a minute, girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face, I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy, yeah
We've seen this all before
Brothers takin' advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm tellin' you

Girl, I can tell you been cryin'
And you're needin' somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lyin'
And pretendin' that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hidin'
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we're your girls
We want you to know that we love ya

See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't makin' it easy
I know you see him buggin' most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes, but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm tellin' you
