I thought that this was something (Yes)
Promising that one day it would turn into something (Yes)
I thought the feelings were mutual and I didn't have to guess
Started bein' skeptical, always unavailable, like you didn't know
But now I'm feelin' something (Yes)
It's tellin' me this may not be the real something (Yes)
But you was showin' me, now I'm ready and you runnin'
Damn, you got me open now, feeling like I'm chokin' now
Where am I to go?

I can't believe that you can't feel my heart
And I can't believe you let me fall so hard
Stop playin', how could you let it go this far?
If you had doubts that I wasn't the one, oh, the one
And you said that you're the type to take it slow
And you said, "Before I step I'll let you know"
Stop playin' before you let me see you with her
You could have told me a change was gon' come, yeah

Is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
Fall through my hood like you use to?
Or put it on me hard like you use to do?
I feel in my mind what's going on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
The deepest of my love couldn't please you?
Or bring it to me home like you use to do?
And seein' her fallin' for your charms
Got me feelin' like I wasn't good enough

See, I know we not official (No)
But us bein' official ain't ever been an issue (No)
It came down to us, boy, remember we were different?
We said that we'd talk if we ever had problems 'bout anything
I was cool with no commitment (Wait)
Let me take that back, it was you so I was with it (See)
I guess I didn't get when you showed you didn't miss it
Now it seems that your interest ain't here, we ain't the same

I can't believe that you can't feel my heart
And I can't believe you let me fall so hard
Stop playin', how could you let it go this far?
If you had doubts that I wasn't the one
And you said that you're the type to take it slow
And you said, "Before I step I'll let you know"
Stop playin' before you let me see you with her
You could have told me a change was gon' come, yeah

Is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
Fall through my hood like you use to?
Or put it on me hard like you use to do?
Ooh, I know in my mind what's goin' on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
The deepest of my love couldn't please you?
Or bring it to me home like you use to do?
Me seein' her fallin' for your charm
Got me feelin' like I wasn't good enough, yeah
All you had to say was this ain't what you want
I won't be so hurt and I could just move on
You had me believin' everything was my fault (Fault)
But I can see it now
It's a situation that I must let go
Cause you ain't gonna be a man and let me know
I guess me seein' you with her
Says it all, ooh, oh yeah (All)

Is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
Fall through my hood like you use to?
Or put it on me hard like you use to do?
I know in my mind what's goin' on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
The deepest of my love couldn't please you?
Or bring it to me home like you use to do?
Me seein' her fallin' for your charm
Got me feelin' like I wasn't good enough
Is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
Fall through my hood like you use to?
Or put it on me hard like you use to do? (Oh)
I know in my mind what's going on
But my heart won't let me go until I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you? (She the reason)
The deepest of my love couldn't please you? (She the reason)
Or bring it to me home like you use to do? (You don't love me no more)
Seein' her fallin' for your charms
