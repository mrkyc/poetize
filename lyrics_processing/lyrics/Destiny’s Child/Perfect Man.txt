Caramel complexion
With the sexiest expression
Curly hair and corn rows
Very nice physique in his lovely clothes
He looked at me
I looked at him
He asked me what I was thinkin'
Because he was so beautiful
I didn't know what to say to him

He was what I wanted
Exactly what I needed
He was what I'd fantasized
He was what I dreamed, and
It would be so perfect
If him and me was we
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings?
We were meant to be
You might also like
I spotted him walkin' in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance

Sexy lips, platinum wrists
Ten slips like he gets manicured
I can't resist those eyes of his
Staring at his lips, and even his ears
And his voice is hypnotizing
And his hand was tantalizing
I dismissed the dire wish
Without me realizing

He was what I wanted
Exactly what I needed
He was what I'd fantasized
He was what I dreamed, and
It would be so perfect
If him and me was we
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings?
We were meant to be
I spotted him walkin' in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance

I spotted him walkin' in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day (other day)
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance
I didn't know exactly what to say
At the restaurant the other day
When I met that perfect man
I didn't speak when I had the chance (oh-oh, oh-yeah)

All you ladies listenin', if you ever have the chance
To run into your definition of that perfect man
Don't be blinded by how fine the man is
And miss the chance that might be your last
Make him understand that he's your perfect man
Oh oh oh oh

I spotted him walkin' in the doorway
Of the restaurant the other day (other day)
When I met that perfect man
