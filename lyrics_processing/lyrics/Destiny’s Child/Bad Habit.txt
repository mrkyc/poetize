How many times
Are you gonna apologize about the same thing?
And how many times can I take ya back
When I'm not the one that's doing wrong?
(When I'm not the one that's doing wrong, no)
I thought, maybe if I started prayin'
That we would get better, but
When I would pray, the answer would always come
Back to me bein' done
But we are so hard-headed when we're in love
So I

I told myself that I would make some changes (Yeah)
But the more I change, there's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And every time that we break up, we turn around and make up
This can't go on now (No)
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

I'm totally out of my element
Learnin' new ways to live while you're in a comfort zone
Not even thinkin' (Couldn't think about me)
To call me, when I get mad, you buy me gifts
Thinkin' it's gonna solve every issue
From the girl callin' my phone (Phone)
To the pictures that I saw (You know what I saw)
And every time you would break up with me for nothing at all
I've taken all I could take (I've taken all I could take)
But the way I live has gotta change, oh-oh
You might also like
I told myself that I would make some changes (I told myself that I would)
But the more I change (Oh), there's one thing that remains the same (Remains the same)
I can't seem to shake ya (Oh, ooh, shake ya)
You seem to really have a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
And every time that we break up (Ooh-oh)
We turn around and make up (Turn right around)
This can't go on now (I can't do it no more, baby)
I gotta move on now (No, no, no, no, no)
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more (Love you no more)
But I gotta break this bad habit (Habit)
Can't take this bad habit no more (Oh)

Let me break it down
Have you ever loved somebody (Ooh)
So much that you was just too blind to see past
All of the pain they was causing you? (Causing you)
Ladies, do you feel me? (Do you feel me?)
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you went against the right things that you should do? (Do)
Woah-ooh-ooh
Think it's time to make a change (Time to make a change)
So I

I told myself that I would make some changes (Make some changes)
But the more I change, there's one thing that remains the same (Baby, it remains the same and I can't)
I can't seem to shake ya (Shake ya)
You seem to really have a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
And every time that we break up (Oh)
We turn around and make up (Turn right around)
This can't go on now (Can't go on now)
I gotta move on now (No, no, no, no)
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more (Love you, no more)
But I gotta break this bad habit (Habit, baby)
