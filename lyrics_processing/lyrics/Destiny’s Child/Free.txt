Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Wait a minute, wait a minute
I think I gotta take some time and clear my mind
'Cause if I don't, I might scream
Scream out loud in a little bit
I'ma tell you what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ladies, ladies, ladies
If you know what I mean
When you in love, you give your everything
Tired of that happening, yeah
Ooh, this time it's for me
Nigga, you been doin' you, I'm gon' do me
Ladies, help me sing it

You steady tellin' lies, I stirred it past a fire
While I kept denyin' the truth
You're always here and there, finally, I don't care
I'ma keep it real with you

Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
When your mind's made up
And your heart's in the right place (Yeah)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
When you done all you could
But what's misunderstood (It's all good, it's all good)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
I'm like an eagle set free
And finally I'm looking out for me (I'm looking out for me)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
'Cause my mind's made up
And my heart is in the right place, yeah
You might also like
Hold 'em up, wait a second
I gotta get somethin' of my chest
My happiness was your happiness
I lived and breathed
You and all your needs
Lemme speak
It's best I do what's best for me
Now ladies, ladies, ladies
I've got my mind back
I've been there and done that
No lookin' back, no
Ooh, this time is for me
Nigga, you been doin' you, I'm gon' do me
I'm free

Time is of the essence and it's much too short
To waste another minute on you
While you steady tryna hide, I'm packin', sayin' bye
I thought you were my dream come true

Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
When your mind's made up
And your heart's in the right place (Yeah)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
When you done all you could
But what's misunderstood (It's all good, it's all good)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
I'm like an eagle set free
And finally I'm looking out for me (I'm looking out for me)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
'Cause my mind's made up
And my heart is in the right place, yeah
No, it ain't easy bein' left out (No)
Or being forgotten about (Bein' forgotten about)
You didn't deserve my love (My love)
I've had enough, set me free (Free)

Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
When your mind's made up
And your heart's in the right place (Yeah)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
When you done all you could
But what's misunderstood (It's all good, it's all good)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
I'm like an eagle set free
And finally I'm looking out for me (I'm looking out for me)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
'Cause my mind's made up
And my heart is in the right place, yeah

Can I get some lovin'? (Mm)
Can I get some time? (Mm)
Lovin' in the morning (Yeah-yeah)
And in the midnight hour (Baby, baby)
I gave you everything you wanted (Yeah, wanted-yeah)
I gave you everything you needed (Mm)
But you just didn't do right (No, no)
So baby, now I'm leavin'
It feels so good to be free, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ah, ohh, ah
Free
Free
Free
Free
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
When your mind's made up
And your heart's in the right place (Yeah)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free
When you done all you could
But what's misunderstood (I cater to my man, It's all good, it's all good, baby, cater to me)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free (Take me out some time)
I'm like an eagle set free (Give me my quality time)
And finally I'm looking out for me (I'm looking out for me)
Ain't no feelin' like bein' free ('Bout time you think about my needs)
'Cause my mind's made up (You been doin' you)
And my heart is in the right place, yeah (I'm gon' do me, I'm free, yeah)

No, no, no, no, get up out of here

No, no, no, no, get up out of here
