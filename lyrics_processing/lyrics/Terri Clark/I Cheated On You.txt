Sweat and cigarette smoke
When you caught that scent in your bedroom
It just about made you choke
You threw a lamp then you threw a chair
Put your fist through a sheetrock wall
A few choice words flying through the air
As you followed me down the hall
Saying why why baby why
Go on and cry cry baby cry
I coulda chose wine but I chose whiskey
I coulda had one but I got tipsy
Why bring a knife when you got a gun
And I ain't sorry for what I've done
When I found out that you were cheating
I coulda got mad but I got even
I did what the ticked off told me to
I took it downtown and I cheated on you
So have fun trying to figure out
The passcode on my phone
And where I go when I go out
And you're sitting here all alone
Stare at the clock till half past two
And toss and turn till four
Walk a mile in my shoes
While I walk a mile in yours
You might also likeI coulda chose wine but I chose whiskey
I coulda had one but I got tipsy
Why bring a knife when you got a gun
And I ain't sorry for what I've done
When I found out that you were cheating
I coulda got mad but I got even
I did what the ticked off told me to
I took it downtown and I cheated on you
It didn't mean a thing
You can take my word
I was just drunk
That's easier said than heard
Ain't it baby
I coulda chose wine but I chose whiskey
I coulda had one but I got tipsy
Why bring a knife when you got a gun
And I ain't sorry for what I've done
When I found out that you were cheating
I coulda got mad but I got even
I did what the ticked off told me to
I took it downtown and I cheated on you
Yeah I cheated on you
