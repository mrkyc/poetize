Last night, we went to bed not talking
'Cause we'd already said too much
But I'll face the wall, you face the window
Bound and determined not to touch

Well, we've been married seven years now
Some days, it feels like twenty-one
I'm still mad at you this morning
Hell, the coffee's ready if you want some

Well, I've been up since 5
Thinking 'bout me and you
And I got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up
We'll get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
And I'll probably give in before long
But please don't make me smile
'Cause I just wanna be mad for a while
You might also like
For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah, that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't wanna go back upstairs

Well, I'm gonna leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up
We'll get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
And I'll probably give in before long
But please don't make me smile
'Cause I just wanna be mad for a while

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up
We'll get around to that
I think I'm right, I know you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just wanna be mad for a while
I just wanna be mad for a while
I just wanna be mad for a while
