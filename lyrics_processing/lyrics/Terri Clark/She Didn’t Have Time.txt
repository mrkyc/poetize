Like she'd been some casual friend
He said "your better off with out me
I'm not what you need"
Like her momma had said about him
He started the car
Pulled out of the drive
Didn't waste any time lookin' back
She watched him go
Thinkin' even a stranger
Would show more compassion than that
She could've cried but she didn't have time
She had a baby to feed
A pink blanket to find
To rock their little one to sleep
She could've laid in bed for hours
Giving misery the power
But she didn't have time
She got a sitter,and she got a job
'cause she had a promise to keep
Her day was a factory and evening survival
At night was exhaustion and sleep
Sometimes she felt life was passing her by
And watching was all she could do
Her friends said "you gotta get outta the house
And maybe you'll meet someone new"
You might also likeShe could've tried
But she didn't have time
She had a five year old to feed
She had ballet class, piano lessons
And t-ball little league
She could've laid awake for hours
Giving lonely nights the power
But she didn't have the time
Not time where would she find the time
To trust a man again
Not time for that flat tire
A crowded parking lot and then
Not time but yes have coffee with the man
Who got her tired fixed
She was thinking gosh he's handsome
When he asked do you have kids
She could've lied
But she didn't have time
All she said was "she's five"
He said "i saw the car seat I love kids
Does she have your eyes?"
And they sat and talked for hours
Giving destiny it's power
She could've been afraid
To fall in love that night
But she didn't have time
She could've been afraid
To fall in love that night
