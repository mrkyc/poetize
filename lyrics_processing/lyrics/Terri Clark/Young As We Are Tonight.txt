Just livin' in a field of stars
Just some hearts with some dreams
Runnin' wild like some kings and queens
At the county fair little town somewhere
Sun down fades you get lost in the mid way lights
That look in her eye, you got two tickets to the show called life
What ever you're holdin' in
Let it go, let it disappear in a ring of smoke
Kiss the sky send up a prayer
Where ever you're goin' just go there
Take a look around for a minute
Take a picture in your mind then send it to yourself
'Cause the truth is you and I
We're never gonna be as young as we are tonight
(As young as we are tonight)
Let the words and the sound
Take your feet right off the ground
Let your love light a spark
And watch it burn right through the dark
And hold on tight 'cause it's a hell of a ride
There ain't no need to fight
What ever you're holdin' in
Let it go, let it disappear in a ring of smoke
Kiss the sky send up a prayer
Where ever you're goin' just go there
Take a look around for a minute
Take a picture in your mind then send it to yourself
'Cause the truth is you and I
We're never gonna be as young as we are tonight

And raise that beer (raise that beer)
And be damn proud (be damn proud)
That you grew up round here
You got one life you got on chance you got one dance
What ever you're holdin' in
Let it go, let it disappear in a ring of smoke
Kiss the sky send up a prayer
Where ever you're goin' just go there
Take a look around for a minute
Take a picture in your mind then send it to yourself
'Cause the truth is you and I
We're never gonna be as young as we are tonight
As young as we are tonight
What ever your holdin' in (holdin' in)
