My mama's a bitch cause she locked my out the house
(Why she lock you out the house?)
Cause I socked her in the mouth
(Why you sock her in the mouth?)
Cause she stole my dope
(Did she smoke it?)
She sold it right here on the porch
(Murder Mike, don't your mama sell rocks for you, G?)
Nah, I just got her selling a little weed
(Did she call the police?)
She knows I'd kill her
Plus my mama is my number one weed dealer
(Fuck my mama, too)
What she do, dude?
(The bitch drank the last of my brew
And she asked for it, too)
Did you tell her no?
(Nah, I told the bitch "take her shit to the store")
Man, chill homeboy, she probably thought you was lying
(Nah, cause when I told her, I showed her my 9)
Shit, ain't your mama been shot before?
(Yeah, my daddy shot her when she smoked his Newports)

My mama's a bitch cause she owe me a dub (nigga)
Plus, why she gotta be at the club?

In  shorts, hella tight on her behind)

My mama's a bitch, but you better not say it (Why?)

But nigga, say something, I'mma let you meet

Mad cause she gave Du-Rag some ass
(Nigga, that's in the past) Fool, you still hittin'
I've seen you this morning, ass-naked in the kitchen
(Fool, your mama's cool when she ain't in the club)
But your mom ain't gave me no "back rub"
(My back was sore, your mama's a sweet chick
Plus you ain't never seen the bitch at Freaknik
Dancing in the street, getting krunk, going dumb
Flashing her titties, sticking out her tongue)
Yeah, I bought the tape out the back of the Black Tail
(I hate it, but she helps me stack mail from crack sales)
