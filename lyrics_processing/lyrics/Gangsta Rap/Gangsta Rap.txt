It's Du-Rag, nigga
Wake yo punk ass up, for the 06 Chi, motherfucker
It's Gangsta Rap mother fucker. (nigga)
Yeah

Fool, I'll slap your momma
Gangsta Rap
Kill a nigga for a dollar
Gangsta Rap
Been a gangster since birth
Gangsta Rap
So when I die put D's on my hearse

I've been a gangster since birth
'Cause my momma's from the set and she jumped me in first
I tried to fight but she broke my rib
She said "stop crying," put me back in the crib
The only fool with a rag and a diapey
Back then, they used to call me "Murder Mikey"
Now I jack niggas with big steel
Even back then, I jacked kids for Big Wheels

I was born on the set
When my momma water broke, she was smoking the rent
So she gave me a drag
Then she named a nigga "Du-Rag"
'Fore I could walk, I was playing with pistols
Now instead of straps, Du-Rag bust missiles
Fuck that, man; fuck a bat signal
When the homies need me, they whistle
You might also like
(Come on, dog!)
(Nigga 10's, nigga!)
(Motherfucker!)
(NIgga, 10's, Nigga)

I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
And when I do, tie my rag to a bird and let it fly
And slap balls, nigga, play by my house rules
And I better be buried in house shoes
Creased khaki suit and some rocks
So when I get to heaven, I got work in my socks
'Cause when I'm gone, I still want my paper right
Only nigga making snaps in the afterlife

I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
But I ain't going nowhere 'cause my perm's too fly
When He made me, He broke the mold
I'm way too gangsta, nigga beat my stroll
If I blast, any ho's gon' be sad
Won't nobody be left to gangsta the ass
I'll be in heaven getting pussy like the reverend
Ever seen an angel catch a 187?
