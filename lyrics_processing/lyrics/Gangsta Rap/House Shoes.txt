In my house shoes
In my house shoes
Slidin' to the store
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
Hollerin' at your ho

In my house shoes, playboy on corduroy
'Cause I never have to run from the roller boys
Bailing through the hood with the AK
Police know 'cause they heard me on KDay
Not a Muslim, so I don't wear boots
Got 5 colors to match all my khaki suits
See these other fools? They in karate shoes
Looking like a ho, I shoot 'em in the toe
Punk-ass nigga better act like you know
Catch Murder Mike in house shoes at the liquor sto'

In my house shoes
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
Slidin' to the store
Nigga
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
Hollerin' at your ho

Du-Rag! And I got them in 8 colors
Get them from the Swap Meet on state a brothers
When the hoes see me, I get a nut on
'Cause they think the house shoes cute with the cuff off
And I stroll on them with the back out
So when police come, I can track out
Marks better act like they know
I leave my house shoes on when I'm fucking on they ho

In my house shoes
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
Slidin' to the store
Nigga

Fuck the club; too many rules
Won't let a nigga in with his house shoes
And I ain't squishing my toes
That's why I don't fuck with no hard soles
Grass, concrete, carpet, or linoleum
Corduroy is what a nigga's strolling in
Ready to hop out when I ride by
Fuck a car, I'll do a motherfucking slide-by
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
Slidin' to the store
Nigga
In my house shoes

Hollerin' at your ho

Hoop in 'em
Hang in 'em
Slang in 'em
Gangbang in 'em
Slide in 'em
Cool ride in 'em
Hit a lick in 'em
Pump a bitch in 'em
Every day, see me sliding through the turf
I even wear house shoes to church
Fuck penny loafers and a sweater
House shoes make a nigga crip-walk better

In my house shoes
In my house shoes
In my house shoes
Slidin' to the store
Nigga
