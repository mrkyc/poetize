We got bitches on the left, Niggas on the right
Bitches wanna fuck, Niggas wanna fight
Do what you gotta do, Nigga keep it tight
But make um understand Its Westside foe Life
X rated, Americans most faded, Bitch plated niggas in the industry
Got it in for me, but I kick back nigga life is short (Yeah!)
And you don't wanna get put on life support
We wake up early, you ain't worthy and got the killas on deck
So the rappers ain't got to get they hands dirty
You wanna battle, hand a bitch the mic (Bitch!)
You wanna squab, I'm too rich to fight (Haha!)
Niggas get him hit him where it hurts til his head squirts puss
Infamous when you ain't kin to us
Abuse with Crips and Bloods, on the loose
Killa Cali all we need is an excuse
Chorus
Just remember you niggas that want me to timber
I'm in my swimming pool, it's the middle of December
Foe every motherfucka that wanna kill a vet
Make sure he sees a silhouette foe his pillows wet
Its the motherfuckin crack king westside nigga lookin mean
So pass the Visine
Hit the supa green shoot the M1 carbine
It yellow tape on the scene, so join my team
It looks like you need protection, From the Westside Connection
Punk the world ain't yours cause motherfuckas like you do chores
You might also likeChorus
Y'all punk niggas don't got a choice (Punk!)
Yo bitch hear my voice pussy get moist
Bitches in the beauty shop, talkin bullshit
Lyin on which rich nigga done hit
How many dicks did you have stuck in you
The topic is always whose fuckin who
Nappy head hoes with earrings in they nose
Always seem to fuck the richest bros
A word to the female consumer
You given all the playas tumors
With your hood rat rumors
Just because you gettin your hair cut
Don't mean you got to spill yo guts
And lie on my nuts
