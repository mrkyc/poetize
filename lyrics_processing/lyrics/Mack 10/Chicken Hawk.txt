Quietly I stalk, niggas call me the Chicken Hawk
Approach with my gun in a two-one-one
As I sick 'em lay my victim may I lick 'em
All action stop nobody move no pop
As I wreck shop red alert make yo blood squirt
When I work in the brownies and the high top chucks to do dirt
Keep it sound put it down my way
Protected by an A.K. as I search for my pray
Through the ghetto hit the peddle every corner I'm turning
Look for the money the kilos and the gallons of sherm nigga
Till we meet I stash my heat
Neat in my baggage do damage nasty as a savage
Looking for the cabbage
Its own 20 grand I spot a bird in hand
As I spread my wing span, I swoop ready to land
Gotta get him hit the spot grab the sack
And I shake it blessed with the game to make it
Plus it's easier to take it, nigga

I'm a chicken hawk huntin' for a chicken
Stickin', my heat to ya brain with the cane, nigga
I'm a chicken hawk huntin for a chicken
Stickin', my heat to ya brain with the cane, nigga
"Don't make me kill up everybody on this motherfucker"

On a late night creep the hawk soars on a mission
Mashin' through the hood heard this nigga had the chickens
36 zones in each sack to be exact
Got 50 G's or more in street value worth of crack
As he put it down out of control with the cavi
Got Benzos on the grass twistin front and back Caddys
Capacino sted of coffe moet
No more rossie Rolex diamonds all glossy
Glossy Mr. Flossy sewed up the block keys to double up rocks
I gotta lick heem nigga want know hit him when I get him
Shoot straight never hesitate fools cooperate
Or I drag  'em, tag 'em body bag 'em with my magnum
Heat to yo chest how we do it in the west
I gaffle up yo dope and fly back to my nest
I stalk hit up in chalk all over the sidewalk
Its Mack 10 foe life better known as the chicken hawk

 Allo
Yeah nigga, I got yo bitch, so take all the chickens you got
And put 'em in a dumpster behind The Forum or I'm killing this motherfucker
 Fuck this nigga don't give any shit
 Bitch shut the fuck up right now
On a midnight flight the hawk glides through the breeze
Pull my wings at ease as I lands in the palm trees
Overlook my lick set my scope like a sniper
Hawk the bitch piper be alarmed foe the type a fool
That ah hoo ride when he doo ride
I came ruff out the box Inglewood school of hard knocks, nigga
A gaffle dick is all I ever gave a ho
Where Pendleton's not a cape so I can't save a ho
Mack 10 just stepped off the planet of the apes
For the money and dope I never rapes I duct tapes bitches
Mack 'em down flag 'em down they pull over
Feel lucky as a four leaf clover in a Range Rover
They never know its the hawk his self
My eyes redder than red with St. Ides on my breath
I draw down all this lickin' got me nervous so I'm twitchin'
Bitch two to the dome or take me to yo nigga chickens

Foe life
