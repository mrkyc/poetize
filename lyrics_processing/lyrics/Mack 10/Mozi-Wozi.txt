She wants me to break it in half

Her brothas want jump me
But motherfuck a lil trick
She can get the dicka dee dick dick down south or in her mouth
Bustin' nigs I like to digs dark meat
Big booty but no cellulite
I'll grab it stab it cause I gots to have it dag nabbit
Fuck it like rabbit
Wanna make it holla
Oh what the hell
Bust a right turn 12 dollar motel
Cause in the hood thats the best a nigga get
Small room smelling like cigarettes
Look girl it's a bed and a building
So stop acting like you gotta have the Hilton
It's four walls so drop your drawers and get cozy
Cause I'mma break you off something at the Mozi-Wozi

You God damn right

Before we get busy go and take a shower
But hurry up, shit, cause we only got an hour
And I plan to be in it up in it to win it a good 45 minutes
And break that back down
Stick yo ass in the air and lay yo head flat down
Waking up the neighbors nothing can save ya
But I hope I don't catch the vapors
Cause funky ass cock is a turn off
It gets me hotter than Pace picante sauce
From New York City ("New York City")
You got a big ole ass and little bitty titties
But it's cool, cause I can hunt for your chest
And now we getting complaints from the front desk
At my door just to get a peek freak
Motherfucka kinda nozy at the Mozi-Wozi
*Woman moans*
I'm breakin' hoes down to they very last compound
Ass up face down
I'm breakin' hoes down to they very last compound
Ass up face down
I'm breakin' hoes down to they very last compound
Ass up face down
I'm breakin' hoes down to they very last compound
Ass up face down

Ain't no frontin' on the pussy that I'm gettin'
Name is Mack 10 but fuck it I'm still sweating
You won't believe all the wreak I'm catching
I'm hard as a brick and my rubber is stretching
See a motel bed can take a pounce
When you give it more bounce to the ounce
And I'm feeling it from the way I'm hung
And I'm killing it I might puncture a lung
Now the Mozi-Wozi is a place for chillin'
But the bathroom towels ain't worth stealin'
The T.V.'s broke and the carpet is dirty
And you got till about 12:30
To have that ass out
But don't fuck around and get drunk and pass out
Cause before I can finish this rhyme
You hear a buzzer and a bitch yellin' check out time
*Woman moans*
(Mozi-Wozi)
Mack 10 bitch

Foe life
(Bitch I'm leavin)
You got damn right
(If you get to trippin)
Bitch, so don't even trip
(Mozi-Wozi)

I'm breakin' hoes down to they very last compound
Ass up face down
I'm breakin' hoes down to they very last compound
Ass up face down, bitch!
