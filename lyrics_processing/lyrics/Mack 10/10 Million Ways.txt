Tick tock around the clock for the rock ya come see me
Just knock at the door I'll grant your wish like a genie
Strait out to get paid stack the loot that I made
Been slangin' dope out my mammas' house since the 10th grade
Never tried it can't deny it in the riots was a looter
Used to hang with drive by shooters
Stick 'em up for Honda scooters
Never was a scholar make ya throw yo hands and holla
While I went to Jr. high slangin' joints fo a dollar
Finger waves was the new fad so they sport a due rag
Niggas got dumped on fo the red or blue rags
Down with the G's so them niggas never serve me
Bellin' through the hood in my honeycomb Jersey
Painter pants cuffed so I fix it on my biscuits
Till my hair get long enough to braid my bitch'll keep it twisted
It's that nigga runnin' wild, punch the pedal to the metal
And everywhere I go it's a must I keep it ghetto

24/7 on a 211 fresh out the county I hunt like a bounty
From 10 to midnight make sure my shit tight
Map out the lick right so that I hit right
I strive to stay alive to be exact need a sack
Can't hack this monkey on my back
So I shot it now you plot it I got it
Exotic to erotic money, ho's, to narcotics
No precision knowledge of self or religion
I'm too busy raisin' pitbulls and pigeons
Put the hustle down steady for the summer
I'm ready way tighter got two birds and a rider
Yea but I'm out fo mo nigga can't get enough doe

Got the plaque in the back straight ragtop
Peepin' the scene with the gangsta lean
Super clean in and out make you weak at the knees
I watch fo the thieves on my hunnid spoke D's
Stereo type foe life from the streets where the palms trees sway
And the money parlay
Fo block niggas got the hoes like sewed up
Bitches on my nuts every since I first showed up
BG nigga with my though skins hangin'
Tryin to look like my big homies that was bangin
Slangin like 90 goin north with the cavey
Twistin through the hood in a 83 caddy
Coupe Deville I packs my big steel
Cause it's sittin on white ones with the two way tight ones
And as I floss I keeps my Nina Ross
Cocked with the clipin to catch a nigga slippin'
