Back when I was just 18, I met the man in black
He said "Jon, it's nice to meet you, my name is Jack"
We hung out all the time, we became good friends
We ran around, we hit the town every damn weekend
I started missin' work 'cause I was dog-tired

Naw, me and Jack don't get along no more

So, I'm here doin' time 'cause he won't pay my bail
I'm gonna change my ways as soon as I get out
I'm headed for that liquor store to buy a fifth of Crown, 'cause
