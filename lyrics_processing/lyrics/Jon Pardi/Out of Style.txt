When I first got to Nashville town
They called me in and sat me down
And told me all about the ins and outs of writing songs
Said write about the things you know about
If there's anything that you don't know about
Just stick around and you'll find out before too long

So I pulled out my guitar and I put my pen to paper
Started working on the groove
They could move to all night long
Yeah, I poured out my heart soul
Strummed a chord, next thing you know
I looked down and I had this song

And it goes
Jesus saves and beers better cold
A good woman's made to love not just to hold
Monday through Friday sure takes awhile
We all get sideways and go that extra mile
The common ways we work and play
Are still alive and well today
Don't need to find a new way to say
We don't go out of style
See Jon Pardi LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
It may never see a bullet
In a billboard magazine
But then I've never been the kind
To go out chasing smoking guns
All I know is all of us tonight
Know all the words and we're acting like
It'll be a week before the weekend's done

Singing, Jesus saves and beers better cold
A good woman's made to love not just to hold
Monday through Friday sure takes awhile
We all get sideways and go that extra mile
The common ways we work and play
Are still alive and well today
Don't need to find a new way to say
We don't go out of style

Singing, Jesus saves and beers better cold
A good woman's made to love not just to hold
Monday through Friday sure takes awhile
We all get sideways and go that extra mile
The common ways we work and play
Are still alive and well today
Don't need to find a new way to say
We don't go out of style
Ain't going out of style
Yeah, no
