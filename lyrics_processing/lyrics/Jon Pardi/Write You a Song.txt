Girl, I'm gonna warn ya, I'm leaving California
First thing in the morning
Me and the band are loading up the van
We gotta go, we got another show
We're headed out to Reno, Jackson Hole
After that, I don't really know
But if you're looking for a good time
We can make us a memory of Bakersfield tonight

And then I'll write you a song
You might hear it on the radio
Baby, you never know
But it's gonna be just about you and me
How much I miss you
You're the one that got away
You're gonna hear your song someday

Now I'm talking to the sweet thing
Backstage in Tennessee
She says she wants to take me home
Show me a couple things I didn't know
Come on, let's go
But I gotta hit the road in the morning
I'm headed down to San Anton'
Long as we're back by sunrise
We can make us a memory of Nashville tonight

And I swear I'm not a bad guy
I just don't got a whole lot of time
It always ends with the same goodbye

But I'll write you a song
You might hear it on the radio

But it's gonna be just about you and me
How much I miss you
