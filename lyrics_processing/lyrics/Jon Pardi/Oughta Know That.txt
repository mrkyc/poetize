Anybody else find themselves
In a 'shoulda done this, shoulda done that'?
Try to do the best you can
'Cause you wanna be good but you love to be bad
Your stress relief comes with the need
To kick the work week's ass
If you're feelin' this then catch a buzz
And go on and raise your glass

There's always one more beer you gotta drink
One more girl you gotta meet
One more song on the jukebox
Spendin' my money like it don't stop
Could blame it all on my roots
My honky-tonk attitude
I'm feelin' this temptation in my current situation
But morning's gonna come, gonna be early
Gotta go to work, gonna get dirty
Shoulda stayed in, instead I went out
But I oughta know that by now

Had me a girl but it went south
Whatever was workin' didn't work out
It could've been my ramblin' ways
My rowdy friends, hell, I can't say
Ain't got time for slowing down
I'm shiftin' gears and headin' out
A good time's callin' my name
So just get outta my way, yeah
