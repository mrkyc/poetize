I knew the first time should've been the last time
I ever let the whiskey touch my lips
Cause the devil wears black and he goes by Jack
And he's really good at helpin' me forget
I thought it was cool when I was a kid
Walkin' around with that cigarette lit
On that ol' dirt road, I lit my first smoke
And I knew right then it wouldn't let me go

And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down

She looked my way then looked back again
Gotta different kinda high when I touched her skin
When she laid it on me, she rocked my world
I knew I'd never get away from that girl
See Jon Pardi LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down

When I walked into my first smoky bar
Cranked up the amp and played this guitar
Had 'em singing along by the end of the night
And I knew I finally got one thing right

And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down
