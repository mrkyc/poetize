Been up since the crack of dawn just tryna get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns, I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shuttin' this tractor down
Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they gonna shine with ya up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (Yeah, girl)
Got a little dirt on my boots

Hard as I worked all day, I'm gonna work harder lovin' on you
Spin you all over that dance floor, right out of them high heeled shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry, babe
I'm gonna kick 'em off on the porch

A little dirty dancin'
Blue collar romancin'
I can get cleaned up, if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels

Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
