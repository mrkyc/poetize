All you gotta do is dance, dance, dance
All you gotta do is clap your hands, hands, hands
You'll be the life of the party
Yes you will, now
Life of the party
Yes you can!

Hey! Miss corner sitter
Never left your seat
Until some dancing heart-getter charms you
To your feet, yeah
Now, you got the movement
And soon you'll be doin' it, so get with it
Baby get with it!

You'll be the life of the party
(You thrill me when you dance)
You can be, you can be
Life of the party
You can be, you can be
(You can dance)
Yes you can!
You might also like
You're a sexy momma
Such a dancing dream
You're no longer sittin', your train's puffin steam
The guys are lined up
They're hoping to wind up with you now
Can't you see it!

You'll be the life of the party
(I love the way you dance)
You can be, you can be
The life of the party
You can be, you can be

There will be dancin', prancin'
With a little romancin'

All you gotta do is dance, dance, dance
All you gotta do is clap your hands, hands, hands

You can boogie, you can boogie
You can boogie, you can boogie
You can move, move, move
You can boogie, you can boogie
You can boogie, you can boogie
You can move, move, move
Let's get down, down, down, down, down, down
Let's get down, down, down, down, down, down
Do, do, do, do, do, do bop
Do, do, do, do, bop, bop, bop dance
Do, do, do, do, do, do bop
Do, do, do, do, bop, bop, bop dance
Do, do, do, do, do, do bop
Do, do, do, do, bop, bop, bop dance
Do, do, do, do, do, do bop
Do, do, do, do, bop, bop, bop dance

Life of the party, yes you will
You'll be the life of the party
Yes, you can
Life of the party, yes you will
You'll be the life of the party
Yes, you can
Life of the party, yes you will
You'll be the life of the party
Yes, you can
Life of the party, yes you will
You'll be the life of the party
Yes, you can
Life of the party, yes you will
You'll be the life of the party
