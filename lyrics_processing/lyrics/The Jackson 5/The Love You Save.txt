Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it

When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be it
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit
When we grew up, you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now, just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or someday, you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed
You might also likeThey'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name to dirt, oh

Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benji held your hand he felt
Electricity
When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chime
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your time

Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or someday, you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
S is for "Save it"
T is for "Take it slow"
O is for "Oh, no!"
P is for "Please, please, don't go!"

The love you save may be your own
Some day, you may be all alone
Stop it
Save it, girl
Baby! Ooh
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Please, please
Or someday, someday, baby, you'll be all alone
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed
Stop! The love you save may be your own, baby
You'd better stop it, stop it, stop it, girl
Or someday, you'll be all alone
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name, turn your name to dirt
Stop! The love you save may be your own!
Don't 'cha know, don't 'cha know
Someday, baby, you'll be all alone
Wait a while
