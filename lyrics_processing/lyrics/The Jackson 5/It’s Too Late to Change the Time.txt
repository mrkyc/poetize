(Too late)
(Too late)
(Too late)

In this automatic age
We shop through the Yellow Page
Gone is the corner store
There's a supermarket there for you (Yeah)
People give way to change
But feelings remain the same

And it's too late, too late to change the time
Well, it's too late, too late to change the time
And it's too late, too late to change the time
But it's no too late to change your mind

It's a new day, a new age
A photograph just taken is ready one minute later
Cars are bigger and better
But the manufacturer's satisfied never
In a world full of crime
I can't let you take that ride
You might also like
And it's too late, too late to change the time
And it's too late, too late to change the time
And it's too late, too late to change the time
But it's not too late to change your mind, no, no

So you wanna be a star? (So you wanna be a star?)
Already think you are (I think you are)
You don't have to go further
Than my lovin' arms

And it's too late, too late to change the time
But it's not too late to change your mind

Are you sure you wanna go to New York City (New York City)
Where girls make it big if they're pretty? (If they're pretty)
Let's say you get that penthouse view
But who's gonna love you
The way I do?

It's too late, too late to change the time
And it's too late, too late to change the time, no
Too late, too late to change the time
But it's not too late to change your mind, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's too late, too late (Too late) to change the time
It's too late, too late (Too late) to change the time
Oh, too late, too late to change the time
But it's not too late to change your mind, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
