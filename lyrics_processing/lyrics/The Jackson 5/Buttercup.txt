There's a chance for everybody
So I took my chance on loving you, no
But just one man can't make you happy
You wanna have your cake and eat it, too, ho

You won't give up your buttercup (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
You say you love two but one's givin' up
'Cause he can stay, whoa
Oh, you won't give up your buttercup (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
You're plenty for one, but two, you're not enough (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
So I can't stay
Oh, rum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pa-dum

I've a right to my opinion
And feeling we'd be better off as friends
(Better off as friends) Ho
'Cause you can't make no one man happy
When you're spreading yourself much too thin, ho (Too thin)

You won't give up your buttercup (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
You say you love two but one's givin' up
'Cause he can stay, hey, yeah
No, you won't give up your buttercup (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
You're plenty for one, but two, you're not enough (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
So I can't stay
Oh, rum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pa-dum
You might also like
There's a chance for even losers
'Cause I will find a love that's pure someday (Gonna one day), ho
But you will be the one who's bluer
Because your game of love, no one will play (Will play)

Oh, you won't give up your buttercup (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
You say you love two but one's givin' up
'Cause he can stay, hey, whoa
Oh, you won't give up your buttercup (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
You're plenty for one, but two, you're not enough (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
So I can't stay
Oh, rum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pa-dum


You won't give up your buttercup (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
You say you love two but one's givin' up
'Cause he can stay, yeah, oh
Oh, you won't give up your buttercup (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
You're plenty for one, but two, you're not enough (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
So I can't stay, stay, oh
Rum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pa-dum

Ooh-wah, doo-doo-doo-doo, ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, ah
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, ah
