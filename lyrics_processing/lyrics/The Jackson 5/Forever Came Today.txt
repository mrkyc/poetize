There you are, standing there
Reaching out for me
Something warm in your eyes
Has touched my heart
And all the love I never knew
I found in you

Suddenly, my world, my life
Was standing still
And you touched my hand
I knew that we had laid a plan
For everlasting love
I've been forever dreaming of

At last, at last, my forever came today
When you walked into my life
Made my lonely life a paradise
It came today, forever came today

Ooh, look in my eyes and see how much I want ya
Feel my touch and know how much I need ya
I may be young, but I'm old enough to know
A good thing, I will never let it go
Let this moment grow into a lifetime
Make it last, make it last

Make it last forever (Ever, forever)
Make it last forever
(Ever and ever and ever)
(Ever, forever)
(Ever and ever and ever)

Darling, ooh, my darling
Make me yours
As I touch your face, tell me love
Has led me (Led me) to this place
Your warm embrace (To your warm embrace)

Thanks to you, thanks to you
My search has ended
And I want the world to see how gently love
Has shined on me (Shined on me)
With everlasting love (Everlasting love)
That I've been forever dreaming of
At last, at last, my forever came today
When you walked into my life
(Walked, walked, walked into my life)
Made my lonely life paradise
It came today, forever came today
It came today, forever came today
Uh-huh-hum

Ooh, you give me love by the hour
Ooh, you're my precious little flower
Girl, you give me so much sweetness
Ooh, you give my life completeness
Make it last for more than just a day
Make it last for more than just an hour

Make it last forever (Ever, forever)
Make it, make it last forever
(Ever and ever and ever)
Make it last forever, oh! (Ever, forever)
(Ever and ever and ever)

Oh, baby
Forever came today
Oh, my forever came today
Love to hear your music, mmm-hmm
Love to hear your song
I gotta hear your music
Hear your sweet song
I don't wanna lose it, baby
I don't wanna lose it
I believe we can make it last forever

Oh, I believe (Make it last)
Baby, we can make it last forever

(Got to, got to, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I believe (Make it last)
We can make it last forever

Don't you believe (Make it last)
That we can make it last forever
Oh, why don't you believe
We can make it last forever, oh?
