He rocks in the treetops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' his song
All the little birdies on J-Bird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

Rockin' robin
Rock, rock
Rockin' robin
Go rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chickadee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singin' go bird, go

Rockin' robin
Rock, rock
Rockin' robin
Go rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Yeah, yeah

The pretty little raven at the bird man stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
He started goin' steady and "bless my soul"
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the treetops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' his song
