And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
And thats no lie
We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed
Our love goodbye
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
The nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythem get me
On my feet
I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take
Her eyes off me

Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control my feet
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
The magic music grooves me
The dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten to me
Through his dance
I'm full of funky fever
And fire burns inside me
Boogies got me in a
Super trance
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
