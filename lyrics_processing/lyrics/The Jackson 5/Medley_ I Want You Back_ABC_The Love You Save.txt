When I had you to myself I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance (To show that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms (I want you back)
Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh ooh baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na-na-na-na


A-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh (A-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh)

You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never never knew before
Like I before E except after C
And why 2 plus 2 makes 4
Now, now, now, I'm gonna teach you (Teach you, teach you)
All about love, yeah (All about love)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me
You might also like
ABC, easy as 1, 2, 3
All simple as do-re-mi, ABC, 1, 2, 3, baby, you and me

(Hiya)
Sit down, girl, I think I love you
No, get up, girl, show me what you can do
ABC, baby (Ooh-ooh)
1, 2, 3, baby (Na-na)
Do-re-mi, baby (Oh)
That's how easy love can be


Stop (Na-na-na), you better save it
Stop, stop, stop, you better save it, woo

When we played tag in grade school, you wanted to be it
But chasing boys was just a fad, you crossed your heart you'd quit
When we grew up you traded your promise for my ring
Now just like back in grade school, you're doing that same old thing

Stop, the love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow or someday you'll be all alone
You better stop, the love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
Heading for a danger zone
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
S is for save it
T is for take it slow
O is for oh, no
P is for please, please don't go

The love you save may be your own
Someday you may be all alone
Stop it
Save it, girl
Baby, please, yeah, yeah
Oh
