Everything has its season
Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme

Cats sit on the windowsill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go?

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, ooh, of the sky

Every man has his daydreams
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of
Sticking to the soul

Thunder clouds have their lightning
Nightingales have their song
And don't you see I want my life
To be something more than long, yeah
You might also like
Rivers belong where they can ramble, oh yeah, yeah
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, ooh, of the sky

(Of the sky)

(So many men seem destined)
(To settle for something small)
But I, I won't rest
Until I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
But listen when I'm gone
(Far away you'll hear me singing)
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh, of the sky, yeah (Of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (High)
Oh, I've got to be (I've got to be)
Where my spirit can run free
(Gotta find) Gotta find my corner
(Gotta find) Gotta find my corner, yes I do
(Gotta find) Gotta find my corner
(Gotta find) Gotta find my corner of the sky
Sky (I've got to be where my spirit can run free)
Gotta find my corner of the sky
Sky (I've got to be where my spirit can run free)
Got to find my corner of the sky
Sky (I've got to be where my spirit can run free)
