Stop! Stop! Stop! You'd better save it
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be it
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing that same old thing
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow or some day you'll be all alone
Better stop the love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed
They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name to dirt, oh

When Benjie held your hand he felt electricity
When Alexander called you he said he rang your chimes
Christopher discovered you're way ahead of your times
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow or some day you'll be all alone
Better stop the love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
S is for "Save it"
T is for "Take it slow"
O is for "Oh, no!"
P is for "Please, please, don't go!"
The love you save may be your own
Some day you may be all alone, stop it! Save it, girl
Baby you better stop the love you save may be your own
Please, please or some day, some day baby, you'll be all alone
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed
Stop! The love you save may be your own, baby
You'd better stop it, stop it, stop it girl, or someday you'll be all alone
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name, turn your name to dirt
Stop! The love you save may be your own!
Don't cha know don't cha know some day baby you'll be all alone
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed
