I got this feeling that's refreshing my life, uh
And I don't want it to end, oh yeah
I met this man, I think about him all night
And more than just a friend, uh, oh yeah

Oh, when you smile, I feel like I earned that
And my cheeks pull back to return that
Oh, in life, I know there's no guarantees
Before I talk to you, I rehearse it
I can't fuck this up, it ain't worth it, oh
Come and lay your love on me

All I want, all that I want is your body
Since it's been so long, ever so long
Since I let a man hold me
And now I see, I ain't gon' leave
Baby, what you want from me?
Ask and you shall receive, yeah, oh-oh
All I want, all that I want is your body
Since it's been so long, ever so long
Since I let a man hold me
And now I see, I ain't gon' leave
Baby, what you want from me?
Ask and you shall receive, yeah, oh-oh

Can't see that I'm alive (Oh, oh yeah)
Oh, and I hope we stand the test of these times
No T&C's apply (Ooh, oh yeah)

Oh, when you smile, I feel like I earned that

I put every other man on ice
Raise my price
You don't have to tell me twice
Don't wanna roll no dice
I want this man on my side
Right-hand grippin' on my thighs
Come here with those eyes
I fall to my knees
Ask and you shall receive

All I want, all that I want is your body
Since it's been so long, ever so long
Since I let a man hold me (Hold me, yeah)
