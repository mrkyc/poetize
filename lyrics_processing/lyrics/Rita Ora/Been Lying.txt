Don't wear my shades to be cool
I wear them to hide my tears from you
Behind the smoke, I'm so red eye
And I'm tired of you asking why
I said I've been lying to you, you, you, you
And I've been lying to me too, too, too
My heart has been through hell and back
I'm only dressed and pretty in black
Middle finger when it comes to love
Act like I don't really give a fuck
'Cause I've been lying to you, you, you
I said I've been lying to me too, too, too, ooh

I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too

I don't always say what I wanna say
I tattoo myself to show my pain
Lonely in a crowded space
Even though we're both face to face
'Cause I've been lying to you (You)
Said I've been lying to me too, ooh
Hurry up and wait for the spotlight
Looks like another whiskey night
What's inside, I never expose
They only see what the camera shows
'Cause I've been lying to you (You)
Said I've been lying to me too, oh, oh
You might also like
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too

It's like the whole world's getting at me
Tryna make everyone happy
That ain't me
Looking around wearing a smile
But deep down, I'm really fucked up
This ain't me
I don't wanna quit
Tryna hang with this
And figure out who the hell I am
I don't mean to make you run away
But I don't wanna forget to be me, yeah (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
The truth is I don't wanna lose you (Oh, oh)
But I don't wanna lose me too (Oh, oh)

I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
