No, no, no, no, no love
Oh, I only want you

I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress a potential problem
I don't wanna spend the night at someone's place
To fill the space that you used to walk in
I don't want another number in my phone
Someone to hold at three in the morning

I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

I know I'm the one who ruined everything
And made you think that it was all your fault
And I know that sorry's only just a word
And when it hurts, it isn't that simple
But I know that if you look me in the eyes
You can't deny that we're something different
And I know I'm going looking for your kiss
On someone's lips to know that I miss ya
You might also like
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

She don't want no remix, she want the OG
She told me she love the new me and the old me
Closely, I hold her up just like a nose bleed
I ain't cocky, but I know just why she chose me
If you wifey, then you gotta be my homie
I like her aura, she gon' be my one and only
I got a presence that they study very slowly
They running off with the drip, tryna clone me
I never tripped, though, gassed up like Citgo
Don't at me 'cause my wrist glow
Love me 'cause I've been ten toes down
And I promise it's gon' stay that way
You looking for another me, girl, I don't play that way
(No, no, no)
I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress a potential problem

I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
