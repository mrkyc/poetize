Yeah, yeah, yeah

City lights, blurry face
Been missing the feeling, the mistakes
Took a walk, fast pace
Shoes off, only four blocks to your place

Had to climb through the window 'cause you lost your key
Gettin' high with the lights low, had a few more drinks
And the next thing we know, your lips on me
Put it on so you can take it off of me

Cashmere, left it lying by your bed
It's the colour red, how could I forget?
Cashmere (Cashmere), last night we made such a mess
I knew when I left, I'd see you again
So what if I did it on purpose?
So what? Yeah, I did it on purpose
Cashmere (Cashmere), left it lying by your bed
I knew when I left, I'd see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Left a mark on my neck
But I don't mind and I don't try to hide it
You woke me up on your chest
And tonight let's do it all again

We'll climb through the window, you can lose your key
Gettin' high with the lights low, had a few more drinks
And the next thing we know, your lips on me
Put it on so you can take it off of me

Cashmere, left it lying by your bed
It's the colour red, how could I forget?
Cashmere (Cashmere), last night we made such a mess
I knew when I left, I'd see you again
So what if I did it on purpose?
So what? Yeah, I did it on purpose
Cashmere (Cashmere), left it lying by your bed
I knew when I left, I'd see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah (Cashmere), yeah (Cashmere), yeah

Cashmere, left it lying by your bed
It's the colour red, how could I forget?
Cashmere (Cashmere), last night we made such a mess
