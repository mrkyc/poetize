A touch that'll get you saved in
A love that'll be your heaven, baby come on

Let me show you what it's like
To let someone love you right
Let me show you what it's like, like, like

Oooh

Look at my moonlight
Say you love but you ain't living, have faith
Cause tonight you'll be on your knees
Making me your religion

Smoking weed when we see the sun
Come up in the morning, you tell me you ain't get enough
We fuck and you're going
You tell me you didn't even cum
We're rolling that presidential, I'm thinking we should run
We're at our best
The mothers thinking niggas test
But they don't even know we did better with less
I roll another one for the ones bringing the stress
I get that on my chest
And get back to the love, cause I'm blessed

Making me your religion
