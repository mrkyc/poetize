R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she's over
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
I, I, I'm ready for ya

Red lipstick on a wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you want it fast? Define fast
'Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed (I, I, I'm ready for ya)

Hit 'em all, switch it up
Put 'em on, zip it up
Let my perfume soak into your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for her, you sayin' no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waitin' for?
Thought it over and decided tonight is your night

Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you feel my heart is beating?

Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
I, I, I'm ready for ya

I'm ready, I'm with it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well, I'm packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you, bang
The baddest woman ever and the hardest out
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money to the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope it's somethin' that you thought about (I, I, I'm ready for ya)

Nothin' on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'd be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please
Can you feel, my heart is beating? (Ah-ha)
Can you feel, my heart is beating?

Yeah, I hear you talkin'
Don't know who you're tryna flatter
Got my mind made up
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you bein' a man
You don't seem to understand
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I, I, I'm ready for ya
So keep thinkin' you the man 'cause it's all part of my plan
I, I, I'm ready for ya
Can you feel my heart is beating?
Can you feel my heart is beating?
