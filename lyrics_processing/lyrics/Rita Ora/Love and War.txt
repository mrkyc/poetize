It's somethin' 'bout you I can't explain
You give me love and take it away
I see you like this game that we play, ay, ay, ay, ay
And yo, this fightin' shit is gettin' too old
And you gon' find yourself left out in the cold
It's time to straighten up or you can move on, on, on, on, yeah

(Yeah, it's something crazy 'bout the way we love to hate each other)
I don't wanna fight anymore
(Every day we fightin' like the navy, baby, maybe we can save each other)
I don't wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off and you mad all for nothin'
I don't wanna fight anymore
Can we just make love and not war?

Baby, somethin' about you
You got that good shit I don't wanna give up
It's too good to give it away, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah, I feel like we're just comin' too close
Who's wrong or right? This is outta control
I'm not perfect, but I'm tired of this bullshit
Let's move on
