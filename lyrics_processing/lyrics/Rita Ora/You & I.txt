I used to listen to the love songs on repeat
Tryna figure out how they would work for me
I just wanna dance with somebody
Somebody who loved me
Now I see you standing in our garden lights
Damn, I knew when I got dressed to go that night
That I finally found that somebody
To stand by me

I will ride for you
Spare my life for you
If you asked me to

Now I'm dancin' in your arms to "Eternal Flame"
I know my life is never gonna be the same, that's fine
There's a lifetime in those eyes
Now we're singin' all the words to "Sweet Caroline"
And you say to me, "I love the way you look tonight"
You know I, I never got it right
Until I found you and I

Always thought that the one thing waitin' for me
Was not a wonderful world, but a tragedy
But you went and rewrote our whole story
To an everlasting love
You might also like
I will ride for you
Spare my life for you
If you asked me to

Now I'm dancin' in your arms to "Eternal Flame"
I know my life is never gonna be the same, that's fine
There's a lifetime in those eyes
Now we're singin' all the words to "Sweet Caroline"
And you say to me, "I love the way you look tonight"
You know I, I never got it right
Until I found you and I

(Oh, oh) You and I (Oh, oh)
Until I found you and I (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, you and I (Oh, oh, oh)

Now I'm dancin' in your arms to "Eternal Flame"
I know my life is never gonna be the same, that's fine (That's fine)
There's a lifetime in those eyes (There's a lifetime)
Now we're singin' all the words to "Sweet Caroline"
As you say to me, "I love the way you look tonight"
You know I, I never got it right (No, I never got it right)
