I should've stayed with you last night
Instead of going out to find trouble
That's just trouble, yeah
I think I run away sometimes
Whenever I get too vulnerable
That's not your fault, hm

See I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you till the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say, what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love, yeah
Wish that I could let you love me now
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

And every time it gets too real
And every time I feel us sabotaging
I start running, yeah, ey
And every time I push away
I really wanna say that I'm sorry
But I say nothing

See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you till the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say, what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
Now, what's the matter with me?

Lay with you through the sunrise
Show you that you're my only, oh, yeah
I wanna stay with you till the morning
Lay with you through the sunrise, yeah
Oh, heaven knows I've tried

Wish that I could let you love me, yeah
