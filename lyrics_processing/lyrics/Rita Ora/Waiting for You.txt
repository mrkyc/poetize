Ooh, ooh, yeah

I don't know what you did
But you did something to me
All of my doubts have disappeared
I'd had enough, I'd given up
Watched all my friends get married
Lonely under the chandelier

Always kept up my guard
Wasn't ready for love
Just a beat in my heart with no use
On the bench, watching out
But it's clear to me now
All this time, I was waiting for you

For you, ooh
For you, ooh, oh, oh
For you, ooh, ooh
For you, ooh, oh, oh, I was waiting for you

Now you're here by my side, look at you smilin' at me
Sun in the sky don't shine so bright (Shine so bright)
Finally, I believe in all these love stories
They will come find you when it's time
You might also like
Always kept up my guard
Wasn't ready for love
Just a beat in my heart with no use
On the bench, watching out
But it's clear to me now
All this time, I was waiting for you

For you, ooh (Oh yeah)
For you, ooh, oh, oh (I was waiting for you)
For you, ooh, ooh (Yeah, I was waiting, I, I was waiting)
For you, ooh, oh, oh, I was waiting for you (Yeah, I was waiting for you, you)

I was waiting, I was waiting for ya
I was waiting, I was waiting for you
I was waiting, I was waiting for ya
I was waiting, I was waiting for you

Always kept up my guard
Wasn't ready for love
Just a beat in my heart with no use
On the bench, watching out
But it's clear to me now
All this time, I was waiting for you (For you, yeah)
(I was waiting)
I was waiting for you
I was waiting (Hey), I was waiting for ya
I was waiting (You know I was waiting), I was waiting for you
I was waiting (Yeah, yeah), I was waiting for ya (Oh yeah)
