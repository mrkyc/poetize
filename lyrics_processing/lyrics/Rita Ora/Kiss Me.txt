Even though I've hurt before

With you I'm comfortable, and I can't hide it

Kiss me where it hurts
Show me something better
Keep me lost for words
So I only feel the pleasure, oh yeah
I need you more, need you more than Ive ever
Needed you now, need you now, we're together
Kiss me where it hurts, so you can make it better
