All I ever hear is more of the same
Try to reinvent the wheel
Thinkin' I don't see them runnin' the game
Are they for real?
And I wonder if they ever will see
Why I keep on saying no
Maybe you can be enough to believe
There's something more

You're looking like a good time
Bored out my mind, I might go crazy
You're looking like you're my type
So I wanna know, baby

Are we gonna play? Play?
I just can't wait any longer
Let's get it on, turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play? Play?
We ain't gettin' any younger
Can't do no wrong, so turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play?
Cause all I wanna do is...
You might also like
I don't wanna mess around with a scrub
Tell them they can hit the road
Need a lover with a bit of a thug

You're looking like a good time
Bored out my mind, I might go crazy
You're looking like you're my type
So I wanna know, baby

Are we gonna play? Play?
I just can't wait any longer
Let's get it on, turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play? Play?
We ain't gettin' any younger
Can't do no wrong, so turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play?
Cause all I wanna do is...

And they already know me, S-A-G-E
I feel like I'm doin' it good
Steer your hips like a car and go under the hood
See I checked and it's good, put the key up in the ignition
Then I twist until it vroom, then I'm askin' you how it's feelin'
I know, I know only that time knows
So let's take this time to figure out what the hell time knows
And when we figure out, let's do that there
I feel like you the one so I'ma prove that there
Are we gonna play? Play?
I just can't wait any longer
Let's get it on, turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play? Play?
We ain't gettin' any younger
Can't do no wrong, so turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play?
