Where did it go, the love that we shared?
Guess we'll never know
Is it hidden behind that velvet rope?
While I'm standing alone out in the cold
Where did you go?
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Do your new friends know that it's all for show
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Or did you fool them all into thinking you're gold?
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Did you do as you're told? Will it ever get old?
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

Don't you remember me, darling?
When you lay down to sleep, do you still think of me?
'Cause I remember you, darling
Without the sadness in your eyes
Now the champagne's running dry

I heard that you been living it up, living it up
Where did I go wrong?
Only yesterday, you were beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
You're the one who's giving it up, giving it up
Singing that same song
You're the only one I want beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
Singing that same song
You might also like
You were so high
I bet you felt you could touch the sky
Now you reached the top, was it worth the climb?
Oh, what did you find? Would you leave it behind?
If I were to say
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
That since you've been gone it isn't the same
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
That maybe I'm wrong and I've made a mistake
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
By letting you go so far away
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Don't you remember me, darling?
When you lay down to sleep, do you still think of me?
'Cause I remember you, darling
Without the sadness in your eyes
Now the champagne's running dry (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I heard that you been living it up, living it up
Where did I go wrong?
Only yesterday, you were beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
You're the one who's giving it up, giving it up
Singing that same song
You're the only one I want beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one (Ooh)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Singing that same song, yeah (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Now I'm just another one (Come on, ooh)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Clap with me now
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Singing that same song (Ooh, ooh)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
You're the only one I want beside me, -side me
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Now I'm just another one
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

I heard that you been living it up, living it up (Oh, no)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Where did I go wrong? (Yeah, yeah)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Only yesterday, you were beside me, -side me
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Now I'm just another one (You know that I know that I know it feels right, yeah, yeah)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
You're the one who's giving it up, giving it up (Oh, no)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Singing that same song
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
You're the only one I want beside me, -side me
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
