Poison

Look, I can get you hot right now (Hot right now)
Said he can but he can't like me (Like me)
Have you taking off your top right now (Right now)
Tell them other guys RIP (R..I..P)
Rita and Kones
The English Bey and Hov, no tea and scones
I can tell by your look, you're ready
We ain't even got to the chorus but I got you hooked already
You won't know where your head is (Head is)
And I got a thing for them red lips (Red lips)
So girl, you better take time (Take time)
'Cause this poison ain't nothin' like a snake bite

Nothing ever gets me high like this (This, this, this)
Nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing could kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you
(Hah, poison)

I get why you mad at me, you acted drastically
Actually casually, poisoned you, made you a casualty
Then you came back to me, oh ma', you way too attached to me
Poison all in your veins, huh, now you're saying you hate us
Tellin' me that you're leavin' me, then the next day we make love
You're addicted

Nothing ever gets me high like this (This, this, this)
Nothing ever gets me high like this

I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing could kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you

Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can sleep tonight
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can sleep tonight
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I pick my poison and it's you (You)
Nothing could kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
(I'm heading straight for the edge)
I pick my poison and it's you (And it's you)
