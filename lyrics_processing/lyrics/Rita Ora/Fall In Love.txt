Hey, I wanna play with you
Let's run away, let's pick a rendezvous
Where we can both lay, baby, let's parlay
Boy, you can be my sunshine
So fine, divine, in every way
But don't let go of me, hold me
Close in, closer, all night, everyday
You make me feel, feel alright
Boy, you're my delight, so don't go away

Don't want no one-night stand
I wanna fall in love, fa la la la la, fall in love
Baby, you could be my man
And we can fall in love, fa la la la la, fall in love
Don't want no one-night stand
Let's fall in love, fa la la la la
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin'
Fallin' in love

I hope the loving stays, uh-huh, uh-huh
You bring me joy, let's not let the loving fade

I wanna fall in love, fa la la la la, fall in love
Baby, you could be my man
And we can fall in love, fa la la la la, fall in love
