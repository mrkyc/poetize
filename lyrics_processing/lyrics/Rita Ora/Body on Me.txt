I just really wanna let this fire burn bright
I'm just telling you to have an open mind
Just imagine us (Ooh)

You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something

Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me
No more, no more wasting time
We can, we can go all night
