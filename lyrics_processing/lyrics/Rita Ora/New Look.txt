Ooh, ooh

See, it's not that I don't trust you
I just wanna know every place that you go
Everyone that you know
Everything that you do
Every single move you make
And I ain't tryna play a victim
But I got my suspicions
Say you're alone
I can hear on the phone someone else in the back
What she doing? What she asking?

What ya gonna do when the sun goes down?
Who ya gonna love when I'm not around?

If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
You might also like
See, it's not that I'm a psycho
We both know it isn't my fault
You were the one who was out having fun
I've been out on my grind
I've been working all the time, yeah
And I ain't tryna play a victim
But I got my suspicions
Say you're alone
But if you ain't alone
You should say to me now
I ain't gonna stick around, say

What ya gonna do when the sun goes down?
Who ya gonna love when I'm not around?

If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Right now, right now
If you find a new look now
(Right now, right now)
If you find a new look now
Ooh, yeah, yeah
If you want, oh, if you want
What ya gonna do when the sun goes down?
Who ya gonna love when I'm not around?

If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Right now, right now
If you find a new look now
(Right now, right now)
