Tired of sittin' here in my room
Waitin' for you to change
With my dress and my lipstick on
You should see it on me
It's such a shame
But I know about the girl you called
The one from the park with the pink heels on
We're damaged, uneven
Broken, I'm leavin'
I'm way too fly for that, yeah (Oh-whoa)

I won't sit back if you want my love
You act like my love is not enough
Don't make me erase you from my phone
'Cause I can always go out alone
Who said you were the first and last?
And look in the mirror, know what I am
They say a love can lead you blind
Well, not these eyes of mine

See, now I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and all my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'Cause I'm young, single and sexy
I'm young, single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young, single and sexy

He'll be lonely on a Friday night
And that's just what he gets
I've been callin' him, callin' all day (All day)
Yet he still hasn't called me yet
And when he does, it will be too late
You know, I'll be at the party hangin' with my mates
Who am I to sit at home?
I'm too busy to wait
I'm way too smart for that

I won't sit here and go back and forth (Yeah)
Don't act like it's okay, you just got caught (Woah)
Constructors can't build this bridge back up
This is how it ends, you're outta luck (Oh-oh, oh)
Who said you were the first and last? (Yeah)
And look in the mirror, know what I am (Woah)
They say a love can lead you blind
Well, not these eyes of mine

See, now I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and all my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'Cause I'm young, single and sexy
I'm young, single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young, single and sexy
Now I can dance when I wanna (I wanna)
Clap my hands when I wanna (I wanna)
No one can say come home
Out all night long, oh yeah
And I will not be bothered
If I wanna party 'til tomorrow
I'm sexy and free
That's how it should be
So come on, come on and do it with me, oh

See, I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go (Fill my tank and go)
Me and all my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'Cause I'm young, single and sexy
I'm young, single and sexy (Oh, oh)
London to New York City, oh
I'm young, single and sexy (I don't even care)
See, I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and all my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'Cause I'm young, single and sexy
I'm young, single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young, single and sexy
Oh-ooh
