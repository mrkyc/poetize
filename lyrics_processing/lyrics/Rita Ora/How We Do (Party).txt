And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party

I stumble up to the window
Opened the curtains to blindin' lights
Make-up all over the pillow
What went on, what went on
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you're dreamin' (Yeah)
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray (Yeah)
It isn't even the weekend (Yeah)
Baby, that's how I know you're the one for me

I wanna party and bullshit (How we do)
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit (How we do)
And party, and party

'Cause when the sun sets, baby, on the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling, yeah, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me, baby (Baby)
We're tearin' up the town, 'cause that's just how we do
We got that sweet, hot loving, dancing in the dark
Out in the streets, we're runnin', shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby (Baby)
We're tearin' up the town, 'cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
You might also like
Hungover, I think I'm broken (Yeah)
You say the fix is a shot of Jack (Yeah)
I said, "Man, what are you smokin'?" (Yeah)
But alright, pour a glass, and we'll throw 'em back

I wanna party and bullshit (How we do)
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit (How we do)
And party, and party

'Cause when the sun sets, baby, on the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling, yeah, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me, baby (Baby)
We're tearin' up the town, 'cause that's just how we do
We got that sweet, hot loving, dancing in the dark
Out in the streets, we're runnin', shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby (Baby)
We're tearin' up the town, 'cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
