Hey there rockstars
Turn up your radio
I can hear you comin'
Start up the video
You're still standin'
They'll never knock you down
The beat never endin'
Let me hear your heart pound

Eh, ah, eh, ah
Eh, ah, a shining star
Eh, ah, eh, ah
No matter where you are

Whoa, oh, shine your light
Whoa, oh, set the world on fire
Whoa, oh, shine tonight
Whoa, oh, set the world on fire

And we don't give up 'til we run out of desire
Race to the finish and we never get tired
We are the winners 'cause we hold the world title
We started slow, but we beat you in the final
