Take a step back to where it started
Where it stands, where it stood
With everyone here, when nothing was wrong
Slip through the cracks, not disregarded, still disheartened
Moving on 'cause I'm here and you're still gone

You left me hanging once again just like I knew you would
It's more than I can comprehend, I'm at a loss for words
So sweet, dipped in honey, but I see
That the look in your eyes tells it, so tell me

You hold the key, soon you will see
You were the one talkin' in circles, biting your tongue
I know you better than you know yourself
Look what you've done, you play the fool
Continue to run, talkin' in circles, biting your tongue

Taken aback, it seems regardless where your heart is
Here and now, the clock still ticks, the timer runs out
Chipped but not broken, let's steal some gold and play the cards
We can win, 'cause I'm still here, I've been all along

You left me hanging once again just like I knew you would
So many things were left unsaid, I'm at a loss for words
So sweet, dipped in honey, but I see
That the look in your eyes tells it, so tell me

You hold the key, soon you will see
You were the one talkin' in circles, biting your tongue
I know you better than you know yourself
Look what you've done, you play the fool
Continuing on, talkin' in circles, biting your tongue (Circles)
Biting your tongue

You hold the key, soon you will see
You were the one talkin' in circles, biting my tongue
I know you better, and you know better
I know you better, and you know better
And you know better, I know you better
You know better, I know you better
