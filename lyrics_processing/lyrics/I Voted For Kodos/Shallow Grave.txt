Just for once, (he'd) like to be greeted with a kiss
But he's scared of his own home
She never leaves him alone
For twenty-three years he stood silently
While she took his manhood, and his dignity
But Now the kids are all gone
This shouldn't take very long
He dug a shallow grave
To the earth he took his spade
Couldn't stand for one more day
So he dug a shallow grave
He takes breath and he says a prayer
He raises his shovel high into the air
He brings it down upon her head
Just one blow and now she's dead
He drags her body to the back door
Leaves a trail of blood on the floor
He bends down to close her eyes
And then he starts to cry
But never the less, he's glad that she's gone
He throws her in the ground and he piles the dirt on
He goes inside to wash his face
He feels his heart begin to race

To the earth he took his spade
Couldn't stand for one more day
So he dug a shallow grave
He Starts to realize just what he's done
He goes into the basement, and he grabs his gun
He puts the barrel to his head
He can't believe she's really dead
What will he tell the neighbors, when they pass by the way?
What will he tell the children, when they come on Christmas day?
What will he tell her parents, when they ask for their daughter?
What will he tell the D.A. when they charge him with manslaughter?
He pulls the trigger and he hears a click
The quick solution's not always the quickest fix
He dug a shallow grave
To the earth he took his spade
Couldn't stand for one more day
