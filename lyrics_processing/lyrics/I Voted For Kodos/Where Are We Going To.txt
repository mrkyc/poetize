You're looking in my eyes
You're laughing at the stories I tell
You say you sympathize
Back at my place we lie on the couch
You like Sunday mornings, too
I'm if it'll all work out
Wondering if you're something new
And you said you like to watch the stars
Early in the morning
Just when the sky is turning blue
And I said if Jupiter and Mars
Saw us lying here
They'd wonder just where we're going to
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
You shudder when you sleep at night
You touch me and you cry
I ask you if you feel alright
You say it's something deep inside

Are you messing with my head?
I know when a girl says anything
You never know just what she's said
And you said you like to watch the stars
Early in the morning
Just when the sky is turning blue
And I said if Jupiter and Mars
Saw us lying here
They'd wonder just where we're going to
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
And you said you like to watch the stars
Early in the morning
Just when the sky is turning blue
And I said if Jupiter and Mars
Saw us lying here
They'd wonder just where we're going to
And you said you like to watch the stars
Early in the morning
Just when the sky is turning blue
And I said if Jupiter and Mars
Saw us lying here
They'd wonder just where we're going to
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
Where are we going to?
