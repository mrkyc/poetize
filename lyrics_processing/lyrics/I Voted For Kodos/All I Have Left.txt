Is this how it's going to be
These expectations laid in front of me
Holds me down, then sets me free
Is this how it's going to start
With this emptiness inside my heart
Over time pulls me apart
Don't break this thread
It's all I have of you
Don't break this thread
It's all that I hold onto
This is what's inside my head
This is how I feel about you
My heart bared open you've read
And this is what I do
Is this how it's going to end
With so many letters left to send
It's not enough just to pretend
Is this all I have left
I'll never forget you
I sat with you as we looked out on the water
And I knew it was right
You might also likeDon't break this thread
It's all I have of you
By this string I've been led
It's all that I hold onto
This is what's inside my head
This is how I feel about you
My heart bared open you've read
And this is what I do

I still remember that morning when the sunlight hit your eyes
I know I made you feel guilty, but I never made you cry
And I know you don't believe me when I tell you the truth
And I know that you look through me when I'm looking through to you
I'm never going to realize, I'm never going to understand
I'm always going to be your boy, I'm never going to be your man
I held you in my arms, and I swore I'd never leave
I just hope that you were listening and I hope that you believed me
I still remember that morning when first I realized
That you're a thousand miles away, and I can't hold you when you cry
And I know that you can't hear me when I call out to you
And I know that you look to me when the world looks to you
And I'm never going to realize, I'm never going to understand
I'm always going to be your boy, I just want to be your man
I'll hold you in my arms, I swear to God I'll never leave
Just tell me that you're listening and say that you believe
