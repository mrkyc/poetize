Well you know that I'm a player, I always shoot to score
When I go home with a girl, she doesn't know what she's in for
I act like such a nice guy, but deep down I'm just a prick
I know that it's deception, but it always seems to do the trick

Well Todd's a different sort, he's nice straight to the bone
Yet it always seems, he spends his Friday nights alone
It's not that girls don't like him, they all want to be his friend
Somehow they don't catch on, to the message that he's trying to send

People always talk about Todd
Then they wonder why he's blue
What they don't understand is that
Todd just needs a little love too
They never see him with a girlfriend
And they always wonder why
But all they can ever say is
"Todd's a nice guy!"

Todd really likes the ladies, but he's just to shy
When they talk to him all he can do is nod a say hi (hi)
He's actually quite popular, he's on the football team
Yet his situation just makes me want to scream (aahhhhhh!)

Todd was in the band, he played the trombone
What I don't understand, he spends his nights alone
Driving in his car, hanging with the guys
He never gets to far, I wonder wonder wonder why!

Todd's so great, he's like one of my best friends
He's so kind and caring and sensitive, I can tell him everything
He's a good listener, I just have so much fun when I'm with him
And he's so friendly and outgoing and he's so cute
But, date him? no, I could never date him
It would ruin our special, special friendship
Because he's so great and I would never wanna lose what we have
'Cause I just love Todd so much, he's such a great guy

If you know a Todd, ask him on a date
It might seem a little odd, but I'm sure you can relate
If you know a Todd, ask him on a date
