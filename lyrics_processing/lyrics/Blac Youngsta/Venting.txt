Boosie the first nigga that made me cry
When I lost my brother I wanted to die
Jeezy the first nigga that made me trap
Guwop the first nigga that made me slide
Gotti the first nigga that made me vibe
I was like, "Damn this shit sliding."
That big forehead ass nigga bumping
I was like, "Damn this shit riding."
I remember walking to Pinehill pool
I was like, "Bro, I'm tired."
Im sick of this shit
I gotta put my hand on some fire
Im sick of this life
I was drinking lean so I can die
Just know when I go, I'm going out fly
Thank you Jesus

I wish I ain't have to look in the eyes of my mother
I wish I could've died for my brother
I'll lay it down for my brother
If i would've been there with him, then I would've fired for my brother
They said Ill go to jail if i Lie
But I still lie on my brother
Thank God everybody in the hood threw a cross at me before I got rich
Thank God for all the real niggas he don' blessed me with and they didn't switch
Thank God for making me dump that bitch cause she weren't shit
Thank God for getting me out the car with them fuck niggas cause I didn't fit (We different)
Look at me mama I made it
Look at me grandma I made it
Yeen gotta struggle no more
You took care of me since I was a baby
When I was a teenager
I know I drove you crazy
Them niggas been hating me
It did not phase me
Fuck boy you gotta sign in
Then you know you gotta sign out
Ion know where the fuck boy live
But I can't wait to find out
Let me find out you hiding out
What you stand for? What you dying bout?
Let me find out when you got sentenced by the judge, you where whining bout it
Let me find out the police told you to find out
Let me find out when you found out that you told them everything you found't out
I be really wanting to put some money in my hood but them niggas disloyal
I be really wanting to go and fuck with my daddy but he weren't here for me
I be really wanting to put some trust in my lil bitch but she ain't loyal
I be really wanting to listen to my moma when she say the bitch ain't for you
I be really wanting to take my side bitch shopping but I can't spoil her
I can't treat you like my main bitch and I can't love you(Whore)
Ion give a fuck about the past
I don' gave the streets all I had
I don' gave niggas my last
Did you rob em in a ski mask?
Was there innocent bystanders out there?
Did you tell em move 'fore you blast?
I know the Devil trying to curse me
But tell that nigga I'll past
They know I'm a motherfucking dog
I know they wanna put me to sleep
I wanna see my mama at peace
And move my grandma out Mcmillen street
Real shit
This all I ask you for Lord
