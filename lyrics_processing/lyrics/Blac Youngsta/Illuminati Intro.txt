How you doing ladies and gentlemen. I go by the name of Blac Yougsta. I rep them three letters C-M-G
And I name this project Illuminati because I felt like I sacrificed a lot of shit to get here. I had to sacrifice a lot of friendships
A lot of family members
The lifestyle, the streets, the bitches, the drug dealing, the shootouts, gangbanging and shit you know I had to stop that shit you know. And you know this is the toughest thing to sacrifice. Motherfuckers you been with all your life you know. And if you ever had to sacrifice something (Welcome to Illuminati) Thank God

Tried to take my stripes, Almost lost my life
Watch my lil brothers struggle, fighting for his life
These niggas killed my brother he was dead wrong
Got the phone call I was heading home
Tried to rob him thought he had some money on him but my brother only had a cell phone
Runna B know I miss you brother know I never ever wanna forget you brother
Know I'm with you brother bought some shoes for you fore you died and I know they fit you brother
Lord knows I hate that bullet hit you brother
Lord know I hate that nigga killed you brother
And you see the pain I be going through
I be shedding tears in that foreign coupe
They just see me acting out in public
But they never know what I'm going through
They don't really know how I'm stressed out
They don't wanna know what I wanna go and do
I just wanna hang out the sunroof
I just wanna let go a gun or two
I already killed your killer baby brother
I just wanna kill your killers son too
I swear to god, Swear to god I ain't gone let no lil nigga play me
Swear to god ima buy mama that new Mercedes
Swear to god I ain't gone pay attention to no haters
I swear to god, I cross my heart
My fingers ain't crossed (no no no) No
That's on my life, that's on my life baby
If you stay loyal, ill make you wife baby

Lost a lot of friends, I miss my dawgs
All these friends I done lost, all these cars, all these houses, all these jewels I done bought, but it still feel like I lost
Even though I live like a boss, I don't really feel like a boss

I done seen so many real niggas die
Seen so many real niggas cry
Seen a lot of fake real niggas switch sides
Oh, Lord can you forgive me, Oh lord i know you hear me
I know i did a lot of bad things i had to take care of my children
I know you understand lord what it take to be a man lord
I was gone get kicked out if i didn't pay my landlord
Gone let me know girl
Is you gone stay down and hold me down girl
If i go to jail right now would you bail me out girl

I swear to god, I talk to god every night
I miss my dawg, I pour my hear every night
I could've never made it off that flight
When i got shot i could've never fight, I could've died
I could've told my brother i love him before he died
I could've told my big cousin not to slide
Without that
I don't know what the fuck i was thinking
You know what I'm saying i just wish i would've told craig like it ain't even worth it fuck that shit homie
Rest in pea- Rest in peace Runna B I love you to death
