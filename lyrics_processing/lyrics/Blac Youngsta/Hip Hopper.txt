You ain't bout that action, you ain't no gangster
You ain't never been in the field, field, fields
Nigga you a rat, if the laws come and get you right now
Nigga you'll squeal, squeal, squeal (Pop)

Ho I'm a dog, bitch I don't text
'Cause I can't spell everything I wanna say
I don't know your name cause I fuck new bitches everyday
Ho, I don't remember your face
Identify yourself
I can't go to sleep unless my pistol on the shelf
I can't fuck that bitch 'less I got a rubber on
All these Percs got me feelin' on myself
All this work, ain't shit for the low
Hell nah, nigga, I ain't givin' no deals
Shoot the weed man if the dope ain't smokin'
Playin' with my drank, this shit ain't sealed (Pop, gang)
Seal popper (Gang)
Most of you rappers just shit-talkers (Gang)
I'll fuck around, shoot your lip off ya (Gang)
Run up (Gang) he'll pop you (Bang)
