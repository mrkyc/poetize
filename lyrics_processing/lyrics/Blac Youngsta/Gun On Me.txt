Ay, bro!
You caught me lacking, man you got me fucked up
I never leave the house without my gun on me, I don't give a fuck nigga!

Coulda killed a nigga yesterday but I ain't have my gun on me
Caught him walking in the grocery store but I ain't have my gun on me
Caught him lacking, picking up the groceries but I ain't have my gun on me
I ain't gon' never ever leave the house without my gun on me
Nigga busted at me yesterday but I ain't have my gun on me
I know I had to fire back but I ain't have my gun on me
One day we gon' bump heads and have fun homie
One day I'mma catch yo' ass with my gun on me

I was walkin' down the street, minding my business, smokin' cookie
Niggas rolled pass me 4 deep and they caught looking
Then they hear the U-turn then I hit the bushes
If I don' had my gun on me, I'd fired a bullet
Then the gun at my house 'cause the police hiding
Nigga rolled pass and caught me lurkin' on the block
I swear them niggas live life for 150 shots
I coulda been dead today nigga but I'm not

Coulda killed a nigga yesterday but I ain't have my gun on me
Caught him walking in the grocery store but I ain't have my gun on me
Caught him lacking, picking up the groceries but I ain't have my gun on me
I ain't gon' never ever leave the house without my gun on me
Nigga busted at me yesterday but I ain't have my gun on me
I know I had to fire back but I ain't have my gun on me
One day we gon' bump heads and have fun homie
One day I'mma catch yo' ass with my gun on me

You can't hang in the park nigga if you ain't strapped
You can't jump in this car wit me if you ain't strapped
I ain't going to that park nigga if I ain't strapped
If the oppositions bust at me, I'mma bust back
I ain't going around the world if I ain't strapped
I ain't fuckin' on yo' girl if I ain't strapped
Everbody get caught lackin' sometimes
Everybody get caught naked sometimes

Coulda killed a nigga yesterday but I ain't have my gun on me
Caught him walking in the grocery store but I ain't have my gun on me
Caught him lacking, picking up the groceries but I ain't have my gun on me
I ain't gon' never ever leave the house without my gun on me
Nigga busted at me yesterday but I ain't have my gun on me
I know I had to fire back but I ain't have my gun on me
One day we gon' bump heads and have fun homie
