Iron my clothes for school, I'mma be fresh as hell
I'mma kill the school, they gon' send me to the feds
Yo' bitch gon' cheat on you, and I know you love her
I'm takin' my gun to school, yesterday they tried to jump me
Get my haircut before school, I'mma be slice as hell
Talking 'bout what you gon', nigga you nice as hell
I'mma walk to school today, mama I don't need a ride
Mobbin' thru the graveyard and I'm gangin' wit the guys

Transfering me to Hampton man I miss south side
Got me on the other side, wit the other side
I know what I'mma do, if they try to play me
I'mma use this tool, it ain't even got a safety
I'm the freshest in the school, you can ask my teacher
I be fuckin' all the bitches, I be real creepy
My last girlfriend left me 'cause I cheated on her
So I can't be wit one bitch, I'm too greedy, horny
Gangbangin' in the school, Gangstas in the school
Gangsta in the cafeteria, sellin' dope lookin' cool
Sold all my dope today, so I'mma play that Gotti
On my player fly shit, nobody needs nobody

Iron my clothes for school, I'mma be fresh as hell
I'mma kill the school, they gon' send me to the feds
Yo' bitch gon' cheat on you, and I know you love her
I'm takin' my gun to school, yesterday they tried to jump me
Get my haircut before school, I'mma be slice as hell
Talking 'bout what you gon', nigga you nice as hell
I'mma walk to school today, mama I don't need a ride
Mobbin' thru the graveyard and I'm gangin' wit the guys

We gon' fight today, we gon' have a riot
If the Prinicpal tryna break it up, I'm hitting him in the eye
If you fight a nigga from my hood, you know I gotta ride
Yesterday day I got my dick sucked behind the slide
I be skippin' school, just to get high
The weed make me think better, it put me in a vibe
Gamblin' in the school, they put me in detention
I ain't wanna take it, so they me gave a suspension

Iron my clothes for school, I'mma be fresh as hell
I'mma kill the school, they gon' send me to the feds
Yo' bitch gon' cheat on you, and I know you love her
I'm takin' my gun to school, yesterday they tried to jump me
Get my haircut before school, I'mma be slice as hell
Talking 'bout what you gon', nigga you nice as hell
I'mma walk to school today, mama I don't need a ride
