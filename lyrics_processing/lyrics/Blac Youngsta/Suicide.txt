I can go back to the hood If I wanna
I remember sellin dope on that corner
Sold a whole lot of marijuana, I'm a boss I done beat my opponents
Whole lot of dope I cook that, I'ma pitbull I done shook that
Seen a lot of niggas lose they life, I thank god I can look back
Lord can you bless my soul
Can you let me live till I get old
I don't wanna die like Pac
I don't wanna die like Whitney Houston and overdose
Ima rich nigga but I took resources
I got Louie Vuitton on my seatbelt
I was born premature doctor told my mama yeah your son gonna need help
I shed blood sweat and tears in my eyes
You wouldn't wanna live in my life
If you play with me we kill something tonight
If you play with me we kill something tonight

South Memphis ain't been the same since I made it
I ain't been the same since they hated
I ain't been the same without you baby
Got niggas doing life in the pen
Niggas tellin tellin on they friends
You know they gone playa hate when you win
You know they gone act fake when you see em
I bought a new house but I ain't move in
Bought a new car but I ain't sit in
Them niggas fake so I ain't fit in
I went to heaven but I ain't get in
I done committed all these sins
I fucked that bitch and all her friends
Tell them haters I don't need sin
Tell the dealership I don't need rims
On my foreign ( gang gang gang), Nobody needs nobody
Nobody needs nobody
Nobody needs nobody
All I need is me and my dawgs
Go against me you'll die like Pac
Don't commit a suicide, Don't commit a suicide
All my niggas they gone ride
Go against me you'll die like Biggie
All these tears in my eyes, Its gone be a homicide
Run up on me you might die
Run up on me you'll die like Pac
Don't commit a suicide, Don't commit a suicide
Run up on me you might die
Run up on me you'll die like Biggie
Don't commit a suicide
All these tears in my eyes in my eyes, run up on me you might die

Don't commit a suicide
Run up on me you might die
