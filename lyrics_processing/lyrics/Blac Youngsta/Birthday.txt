Snitched on every song
Talking to everybody and gossiping on every phone
Fuck nigga pressed charges
And got the feds running up in every home
I got to play it safe out here

Tell 'em how daddy-o used to lil boy you, make you run to the store for a cigar and some water (ho)

Lost so many niggas to this shit
I just wanna thank god 'cause I'm breathing
I get my gun out when I'm delivering
I got my gun out when I'm receiving
If you shoot on me I ain't gon' snitch
And show up in court, I'ma get even
I'ma just stop a lil nigga from breathing
I'ma make your lil cousin have a seizure
You the only nigga comin' CIAA with a bulletproof truck
Scared for your life
How you gon' go and shoot your own truck up
And play dead for the night? (gang gang)
And then press charges on me
And tell the police I did that shit (gang gang)
Now the feds say that I'm a menace
This is for all the young niggas innocent
I'm innocent

Fuck Trump
Ain't been a good president since Kennedy (ho)
If Dolph show up in court, man these bitches gon' sentence me
On my paperwork they got the nigga's name in every sentences
