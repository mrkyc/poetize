And I want you, you
Pull ya
Jacquees try you

Im tryna show you the type of things
Take you to places you've never seen
I get the camera, let's make a scene
I know your man ain't got nothin' on me
We need some time to pray some things
Your grandmama she raised a queen
I'ma put you where you supposed to be
Girl I want you to come close to me

I want you
Girl you know that I want you
Young rich nigga do what I want to
We can ride wherever you want to
I ain't never gon' hurt you
Came a long way from sellin' birds bae
Back then I used to serve paper
You can have my heart, you can have my car
You can ride along the curb baby
I'm the releast nigga in it
None of these niggas are nothin' like me
Eat that pussy when I hit it
He ain't gon' give you that tongue like me
I can get a little nasty baby
Have you ever fucked a savage baby?
Booty lookin' like an apple, i can't even lie i just wanna grab it baby
Everything on me Louie V, I can keep up with your fashion bae
I just wanna see you happy bae
