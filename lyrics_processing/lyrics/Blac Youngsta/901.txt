Hey, hey little bitty bitch, don't play with me
Play with your man, whore

She got stretch marks on her stomach, she from down South
Bitch, I understand I got a momma, I'm gon' fly you out
Ho, don't play with me (River)
Ho, play wit' yo' mammy (Side)
Ho can't stay with me (Orange), if she don't drop them panties (Mound)
Keeping With The Kardashians (North), I can't lower my standards (Memphis)
Just know I'ma pull up blasting (South), if we got some ammo (Memphis)

You know I'm from Memphis, everybody killin'

Martin Luther King got killed in the city, this why I don't trust shit in the city
You can't play both sides
Better make shit understood, who you with in the city? Last bitch

Cook for me? Bitch, all I need is some Rotel
Runnin' to the money 'til break my ankle like Odell
Walkin' barefooted, how I got this big black toenail
Gang gang gang
