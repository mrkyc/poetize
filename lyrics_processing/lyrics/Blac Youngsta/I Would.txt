I would kill the rap nigga (lil bitch), I would expose everybody
I would fuck on that lil bitch (lil hoe), but she gon' tell everybody
I would still sell dope, but they gon rat me out
I give the street niggas hope, that they could make it out
If I could talk to my niggas, I would tell 'em that I miss 'em (fuck nigga)
If I could make one wish, I would free all my niggas
I would tell you bout my past but the feds might come
I would tell the judge kiss my ass but he might revoke my bond

I don't do no waitin', I don't got no patience
You gon' raise your right hand
If the feds lookin' for me you gon hide my baby
Young nigga mind so fucked up
Made it out the hood I done lucked up
I done sacrifice for my brother
I give my life for my mother
You ain't getting money nigga shut up
'Fore you fuck around and get murked
Anybody doubted me done fucked up
Broke ass nigga lookin' fucked up (fuck nigga)

I would kill the rap nigga (lil bitch), I would expose everybody
