Grandma stressed, can't pay tha rent
I remember sittin' on tha bench
Every since I got rich, I ain't been tha same since
My nigga told me don't worry, boy that shit just ain't meant
Runnin' from tha law, jumpin' fences
Wreckin' cars and shit, they didn't
I ain't never seen a ho that ain't went
Every rule, that I bent
Fuck them niggas, they can die tonight
Ima kill every nigga they sent
I got them shooters on payroll, Ima tip every shooter that went
And Ima kill every shooter that didn't
Why I could kill, I just need me a vacuum seal
I ain't throwin' in no white flag
Tell that bitch Ima smack him still, tell that nigga Ima wack him still
Jeep Wrangler got tha 2nd wheel
I got rich off my 1st deal, you got rich off yo 2nd deal
You late !

I got some killas, I got some bad bitches on tha way
I know some niggas that'll run in yo house for that safe
I'll do 135 years for my lil bae
I know them haters, they hated, they hated to see me this way
I just pull up on a flex , fuck her face
I just bought another tech, and a K
I got 100 pounds of marijuana stuffed in my basement
Fuck that bitch cuz she dissed me back in tha day
You might also like
Back in tha day, I was fucked up I wasn't straight
I had no food on my plate, I had no money in my safe
And no fuck niggas ain't in my face
Told Yung Lan put a lil' mo bass
I got a lot of shit I need to say, I put that FN in yo face
My bitch thick wit' a small waist
I'll go to Ruth Chris, order me a steak
I'll kill me a fuck nigga broad day
I got a whole lotta shit on my plate
I gotta make sure my Big Mama straight
I don't give a fuck about he say, she say
I don't give a fuck cuz I know we straight
I don't give a fuck 'long as we ate
