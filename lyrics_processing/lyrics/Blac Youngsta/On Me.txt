Ay, this for my muthafuckas out there goin' thru that struggle
Don't give up on yourself my nigga, stay strong, keep pushin'
They tell ya can't do it you can do it, just put yo' mind to it my nigga
CMG!

Momma said son don't die on me
Know a lotta niggas tried to plot on me
Know a lotta niggas switched sides on me
Know a lotta niggas wanna ride on me
Keep that 9 on the side of me
I can't let no nigga take me
Lord you know my family need me
What my family gon' do without me
I remember days wit no food
Remember wearin' same clothes to school
I just wanna buy my momma a coupe
You don't understand what I've been thru
Niggas said they gon' ride for you
Said they gon' bust five for you
They ain't never died for themselves
How the fuck they gon' die for you

Niggas hate on me for no reason
I pour a 8 in a 4 liter
This a fuck on yo' lil' hoe season
I'mma just fuck on her for no reason
I'm a codeine sipper pour me up
All this purple she love in my cup
You won't fuck me girl when I was broke
Don't you try to fuck me 'cause I'm up
They might be real, but they ain't real as us
Fuckin' wit me, I'mma hit you up
Got so many bitches, I'm in love
Lord you know I really miss my cousin
Them lil' niggas want my life
They tried to take off my stripes
Feed my lil' niggas wit life, Lord
I know it ain't even right, Lord

Know these niggas wanna murder me
That's why I keep that 40 close to me
I can't trust nobody
Can't even trust a nigga close to me
I know if I turn my back, these little bitty niggas gon' call me out
I remember all dem days and nights when grandma put me out
 want to see it
Lord you know I'm fightin' demons
I'm addicted to the lean, I'm fiendin'
If I say I love ya then I mean it
Young nigga sittin' at arenas
Now I'm ridin', let me get it girl
