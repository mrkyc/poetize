They say Tone come out the house it's summertime
Damn Fam it's this time again
Upper 80's chrome shining on your rims
They was dirty 9 months you brought some rags out
This weather make you hit your saving pull some cash out
I been waiting for this time of year
I been looking out the window like ah quarter year
Hoping all these cloudy days forever father disappear
Cause something bout June July an August
Make you grab the wheel
I put some air the sliping slide
Call ah couple friends over good vibes on water rides
No tears in summertime it's good days I visualize
Cause life's is really short call it fun size
I think her thong bikini brought the smile back
I think the armoral brought the tires back
I'm feeling brand new like ah starter cap
Dropping back to back albums like like um swimming laps

I'm tryin to sip a michi
Catch up with the people that ain't seen me
I'm bouncing back like yeah yeah yeah (x2)
You might also like
I bounce back I gased up
I pulled off I'm strapped up
My seatbelt I look up
I thank God that sun out
My whip clean my braids right
No sleeves on my shirt my tattoos all them girls yeah they look
My eyes on that road like I should
My snap yeah its lit yeah go look
This a page of my life in my book
You can read all them steps that I took
Let's roll up one time
Let's pour up one time
Yeah let's go up one time
Yeah I fucked up that time
But I grow up that time
So I gave up them lines
I guess we all got them problems dawg
I guess it's our job to solve them dawg
Those were winter time lessons dawg
But these are summertime blessings dawg

I'm tryin to sip a michi
Catch up with the people that ain't seen me
I'm bouncing back like yeah yeah yeah (x2)

Summer summer summertime
