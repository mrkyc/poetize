I wonder why we take it
Take this life for granted
I wonder how we make it
Make it on this planet
Everyday everyday everyday we just want what
We want what we want
Ain't no if ands and no buts
Want what I want gotta have it right now
Get in my way then my gun could go Blau
Been had that in us we want to be first
In us since birth, proof of the curse
Worse
We deny that and we try to act like its all good
Cause we the first world meanwhile the third world
Has been deprived of all that we would call good
And when a child has grown up in a small hood
Is when a child is told that he is no good
And when he looks around all he could really see
Are faces like his but ain't non of them free
Money is the fruit that don't grow on trees
Money is the root that don't grow in the ground
And if you let money inspire your love
It'll fire you up and burn you down
Wait
Is that what that is
Hi-Tone you rapping bout this

1st world to the 3rd yeah

I know you heard them stories
I know you watch the news
I know you read them head lines
I know it troubles you
But you got your problems right?
You got your own cross to bear
You make your own bed at night
You gotta toss and turn in there
You gotta balance it out cause you got your own struggles but people still need you
You gotta watch for the phonies that say they your friends but they heart full of evil
Sometimes you gotta get lost
You might end up finding yourself
Then you realize what you had
Then you could bless someone else
Shout to my people around the world
Yeah TFC is global
I see the tatts on yo hands
Stick to the game plan that I showed you
Cause hard work paying off you can be a boss fuck what they told you
You could get it for yourself build it from the ground so nobody own you
Is that what that is
Hi-Tone you rapping bout this
Hi-Tone boy you got some nerve
First World to the third
(yeah)

Its my world Its your world (x4)
