They say Tone live the good life look at him rap
He always shooting videos making some cash
He always got the sauce like the taco man
But they don't see the hard work that goes into the back
All they see is all the gold chains
Cocaine
They just wanna be the dope man
Dope man
They ain't ever seen an episode of
Soul train
And they ain't ever got a chance to hear Nate Dog sing
But who doesn't wanna be a rapper
Big blappers
Gold teeth
Fucking bitches with big asses
No lease
All cash feeling like Cassius
I always wanted them Versace biggie Smalls glasses
Cause that's what I saw on MTV
Big snoop dogg taught me how to role my tree
Next day ditch class like fuck PE
Get high get braids like ODB
Yeah I'm a rapper
You might also like
Everyday you wake up you say it's my time
Today gon be the day that they gon see my shine
Today I wrote a verse that might change my life
New drums over samples oouu that's my type
I take time on it I cry on it
Drive all alone just to vibe on it
I slide on it I ride on it
Beats like a caddy I glide on it
But they don't really listen
They don't see yo vision
So its independent hustle that shit more efficient
I got fans out the state call it long distance
A&Rs scared cause I look different
But still the radio won't play my shit
It takes one co sign then they on yo dick
One celebrity to just post my pic
I mean how much longer can I do this shit (ha)

10 years later still no hit
No plaques on the wall boy
Still no kids
No big features like Cole or Wiz
I fell ah whole lotta times still I ain't quit
Hold on
Who said I ain't shit
I sign autographs underneath snapback lids
I walk through the mall take pics with kids
I drop ah hat and ah tee shit sell out quick
But I ain't sell out
Still ride around my town
Hit the Burger King drive they give me the crown
I ain't Jay but they still scream my name loud
They through me out with no life vest I ain't drowned
I could've quite along time ago but that ain't  me
That defeats the whole purpose of the TFC
Fuck the money and the politics I do it for free
There's ah whole lotta talent in the COV
I'm just the only one that hustled till the end my G
Now I'm a rapper my G
Living my dreams my G
