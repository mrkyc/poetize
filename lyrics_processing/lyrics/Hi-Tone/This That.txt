This that, this that, catch it with a vibe music
This that, this that, make you wanna ride music
This that, this that, smoke and get high music
Get some money get dressed, and get fly to it

This that, heard the beat and then I caught a feeling music
This that, talking to my saviour looking at the ceiling
This that, homie's standing on the corner chilling
This that, tired of the ghetto, I hope we make a million
This that fuck with police music
This that fuck the industry, I'm in the streets music
This that all lives matter, all peace music
Real shit for real people, I hope we link to it
I'm talking no age limit, I hope we all relate
This that white man watching how many laws can break
The world counting us off soon as we caught a case
This that 330 caliber, time and place

This that, this that, catch it with a vibe music
This that, this that, make you wanna ride music
This that, this that, smoke and get high music
Get some money get dressed, and get fly to it

This that, this that, mama needs a new car
This that, I'mma get it so I'm spitting bars
This that, no sleep but I'm built for it
Big body off the lot and get some wheels for her
You say I rap, I say I am changing lives
I pick a homie up and tell him he can touch the sky
This that, this that, stand on your two feet
This that no Xanax needed on a new beat
My motivation make it all go up
When you leaving check the check
That shit don't add up
You got a nine to your dome, homie don't give up
I say a prayer for you dawg, hope it lift you up

This that, this that, catch it with a vibe music
This that, this that, make you wanna ride music
This that, this that, smoke and get high music
