I swear the last 6 weeks been a dream
Bad dreams boy very bad dreams
Chest pains feeling like a can't breathe
Started picking up the bible get these devils off me
Started contemplating life what I really wanna be
Feels like the whole world wants something from me
(oouu)
I man 3 full time jobs
If I don't do it Ima lose it oh help me God
5 years 9 tapes don't doubt me now
Lotta pain lotta tears but I'm still gon smile
Still gon climb still gon run my miles stack my piles
And everybody go through trials
(yeah)
Still here 2 months no beers
First verse I ever wrote sober damn this weird
I sat back really analyzed all my fears
Tattoos on my fingers wiped all my tears
I ain't afraid to say it (no no)
I ain't afraid to say it (yeah yeah)
I ain't afraid to say it (no no)
I ain't afraid to say it (yeah yeah)

You might also likeYou say I changed homie
Yeah I changed
When it rains homie
It really rains
Woke up thought I'd never be the same
Why me why me I'm the only one to blame
No outside no long drives
All stressed out own brain telling me lies
All black rooms all I see is white lines
Get home 6am and tatt at 9
No wonder why I broke down like hooptie
I never hit the brakes park the car watch a movie
Kick the vans off the feet lay back sip a smoothie
Cause even when I'm chill bro the thoughts still moving
Like who broke my glass and took my clothes
I put money on it homie someone I know
Some lowlife hater trying to stunt my growth
I can't believe old friends go down that road

Another day another dollar
Another day another problem
Stressing is gon be the death of me yeah
