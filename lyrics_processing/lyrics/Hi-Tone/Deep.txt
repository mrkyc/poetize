All these visions I'm getting I see a lot  of death
I'm always positive homie this shit ain't making sense
Whole prescription of xanys but I ain't take um yet
2 of those them ah get you higher than private jets
I'm just trying damn I thought I lost my mind
I think everybody looking I can't even stand line
Where was you where was you
You ain't even hit my line
I been going through the most I been feeling like I'm dying
It's okay I be strong
I'm at home, with my dogs
They know something wrong with daddy
I won't even take a jog
I got dog shit on the lawn that shit sitting like a log
I got my own shit to deal with homie 2 days the same drawls
Im grimy I'm grimy (oouu) I'm use to being shinny
2 bottles of the henny at the club now it's Dasani
I'm in a row boat all these waves they feel like tsunami

What's up I feel like hanging up
All this energy and money I spent for what
All these tapes and these verses I get no love
Cause my skin brown like beans in a cup
That's over yo head
I count heartbeats in my bed
I count 5 homies I trust
I got homies owe me some debts
It's just me myself and my God
My girl my fam and my friends
Got ah whole lotta them acquaintances
But gotta hand full of them friends
(yeah)
When life hits it hits hard
My job to get back up keep reaching for the stars
A lotta people gon doubt me but I still spit my bars
I still gon grind hard like 2 lines and yo jaws
Get it get it
