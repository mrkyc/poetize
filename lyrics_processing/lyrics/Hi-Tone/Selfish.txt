When your shoes more important than your health
When your money more important than your family
When you spend $500 on a belt
But your homie just asked for some help

I took some time off
This is my life dog
I got so caught up in drugs and my dreams
I didn't see grandma for 2 years I mean
What kinda man puts his fam in the back
I been blind in the fact that there's more than this rap
There's more to this life than what all of us think
I've always been good but I got to my brink
2 hours of sleep makes it real hard to think
A real man should learn how to balance it all
My girl wanna ring but I walk through the mall
Yeah I buy me some clothes and I shop with my dogs
Yeah we run through that money I fucked off a lot
3 days of shopping I could've had that ring
Imagine her smile so priceless serene
She stuck by my side while I chased all these dreams
I been selfish so selfish while I chase the cream

When your money more important than your family
When you spend $500 on a belt
But your homie just asked for some help

I know I know yeah I know
We selfish we selfish yeah
We always think for are selves
We shallow we shallow yeah


You can't use your bank card when you take your last breath
So enjoy all the small things the things we forget
Like hugging your mama and sending a text
Mama I love I love you to death
I know I been gone I been lost in this world
Houses in hills tables of snow
Patron out the bottle like water it flows
Norcos I popped them like bubbles you blow
I lost some homies throughout all this shit
I did some wrongs but I proudly admit
Called them and told them forgive me for this
Just forgive me like he did for all of are sins
Mia I promise will go on a trip
Wherever just us just brother and sis
I ain't been perfect but who the fuck is
I'm just back to the basics the basics it is
Tone

When your shoes more important than your health

When you spend $500 on a belt

I know I know yeah I know
We selfish we selfish yeah
We always think for are selves
