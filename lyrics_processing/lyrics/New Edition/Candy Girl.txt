My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me high up off my feet
She's so fine, as can be
I know this girl is meant for me

Candy girl
You are my world
You look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
When you're with me
You brighten up my day

All I know when I'm with you
You make me feel so good, through and through
The way you walk, and the way you talk
You always look so good, you make forget my thoughts

(Do you really love me?) Do you really love me?
(Don't you really care?) Don't you really care?
(Do you really need me?) Do you really need me
And will you always be there?
