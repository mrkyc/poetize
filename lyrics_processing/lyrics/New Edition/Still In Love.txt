I'm still in love with you
Still in love, baby, listen
(Verse 1 - Ralph)
Oh what can I do girl, so much in love girl
But your friends got you thinkin' and it's affecting you
What can I do girl, so in love girl
And I don't know what to do 'cause I don't wanna lose you
(Pre-Chorus - Ricky)
No what would I do without your love?
Baby it's Heaven sent from above
So you don't believe what your friends tell you about me
(Chorus)
I'm still the man for you and I'm still the man that's true
And I'm still the man who's lucky and I'm still in love with you
It don't matter what your friends do, they're just jealous of me and you
And I'll always keep you happy 'cause I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love, yeah
(Verse 2 - Ricky)
Time passes so fast babe, I wish it would last babe
'Cause I know in my heart that my life ends and starts with you, yeah
And baby I know that this feeling I'm feelin' just won't let me go away
'Cause you're the first true love I've ever known
