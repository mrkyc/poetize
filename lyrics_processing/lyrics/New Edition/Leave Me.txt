I know it comes as no surprise
That I am so in love with you
When I think of us two I start feeling blue
Something that I've gotten used to
But lately I must admit times have been hard
Put a straining pain on my heart
As much as it hurts to say these words
I think it's best for you to

Leave me
Live your life
Don't worry I will be alright
In no time
You'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry
I'll always be right by your side
Maybe someday we'll get another try

It seems as though every time
I speak your name I get weak
'Cause I imagine before I go to sleep
That you were right here with me
Somebody told me
You can't appreciate (can't appreciate)
What you have until it is gone
But they were so wrong
Because I have cherished you
It's just I'm not the one for you

Leave me
Live your life
Don't worry I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry
I'll always be right by your side
Maybe someday we'll get another try

Deep down inside (please hear me out)
You expect so much (that's why I'm hurting inside)
And I don't even (not at all)
Feel appreciated for my efforts girl
(it feels like we've grown apart and I don't know if we can handle)
The trouble (If not it's gonna hurt me to see you leave)

Leave me
Live your life
Don't worry I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry
I'll always be right by your side
Maybe someday we'll get another try
Leave me
Live your life
Don't worry I will be alright
