This is for the hundred dollar billers
For my butter pecan Ricans
And my chocolate Playboy bunnies, that's right
Feels so good (They just don't know)
That's right
(Bring it on, one, two, three, drop it)

Oh yeah, it feels so good
(Ladies and gentlemen, welcome)
To be back where we belong
Oh yeah, it feels so good
This is where we started from
(Come on, Ron)
(Stand up on it, Ron)

Everybody let's take a ride
Everybody just come inside
On a journey, let's go back in time
I'll keep the feeling right

Everybody it's time to play
Come on everybody let your Discman sway
Forget all the other sounds
'Cause New Edition is what's going down
See New Edition LiveGet tickets as low as $72You might also like
Now the time has come
To return as one (Yeah, baby)
And it's never been better
(And now) (Now) I never thought this day would come
And it feels so good to me
To be back where we belong
(Come on, come on, y'all, woo)

Oh yeah, it feels so good (Yeah)
To be back where we belong (Back where we belong)
Oh yeah, it feels so good
This is where we started from
(This is where we started from)

Yeah, N.E. back for the nasty 9-6
Jam (B. Brown), bring it to me
(Stand up on that pimpin')

Been too long, it's time to get in the mood
Something to make you move
A lil' something that's in this groove (Yeah, y'all)
It'll be alright
Nobody's humpin' around tonight
And baby your mama need not to get it
'Cause N.E. is damn sho'nuff comin' with it, oh
Fancy cars 'n' everything
Silk, slips and trips to Rio
Playin' C-low with the gamblers
Lear jets and different sets
Placin' bets Big Willie Style
I gots the frequent flier miles

I'm goin' places
Atlantic City to Vegas
Leaving no traces
Sippin' bubbly with familiar faces
Me and my crew, long overdue
Jimmy and Terry with the N to the E
The money-making recipe

Oh yeah, it feels so good
To be back where we belong
Oh yeah, it feels so good
This is where we started from
(N.E., back where we belong)
Oh yeah, it feels so good
To be back where we belong
(Somebody sing it, we're)
Oh yeah, it feels so good
This is where we started from
We're comin', we're comin' back from a long hiatus
It's the greatest
The latest craze to hit the stages
Thee amazing
Sold out nights, spotlights, and fights for tickets
Dips with picket signs
Standing in line for hours and days
Gettin' weak, fiendin' for a peek of that N.E. mystique
Know what I mean?
As we play up on the scene
Big money players coming clean with the green
J.G

Now the time has come
And we have just begun
We're coming loud and clear
N.E.'s back and they're in your ear
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
We've gotta stay together somehow
We're back where we belong
And it feels so, and it feels so good

Oh yeah (Yeah), it feels so good
To be back where we belong (Come on, come on)
Oh yeah, it feels so good (Come on)
This is where we started from
(Are you ready? Put your hands in the air, come on)
Oh yeah, oh yeah (Yeah), it feels so good
(Oh yeah, baby) (Yeah, yeah)
To be back where we belong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)
Oh yeah, it feels so good
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)
This is where we started from
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)

Oh yeah (Yeah), it feels so good
(Ladies and gentlemen)
To be back where we belong
(Thank you for waiting for so long, N.E. is finally back, y'all)
Oh yeah (Yeah, come on), it feels so good (Come on)
