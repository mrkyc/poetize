Friends..do do do dum
Friends..do do do dum
Friends

I guess you want to know, why I've got to go
Knowing how I feel about ya
I've been gone about, singing my heart out
It's hard to fight this feeling, feeling inside

Girl, I cannot do what I want to do
Mama said that we're moving, moving too fast
If we hold onto, and if love is true
I know the day will finally come around

Let's be friends, cause I don't want to hurt you
Let's be friends, I don't want to let you down
Let's be friends, nah, girl, I don't want to hurt you
Lets be friends, I don't want to let you down

Girl, if let me explain why we must refrain
Why we can't give in, we can only just be friends
If you only knew what I'm going through
I really want you but I can't stick around

Girl, I cannot do what I want to do
Papa said that we're...we're moving too fast
If we hold onto, and if love is true
I know the day will come, but in the meantime

Let's be friends, I don't want to hurt you
Let's be friends, I don't want to let you down
Let's be friends, I don't want to hurt you, no

You know you're the only one for me, girl
You're the only one I need, girl
Won't you be my friend, we can work it out
Let's be friends, let's be friends
It's so hard to turn love down
Friends...I just can't stick around
Friends
No girl, don't you wanna be my friend?
I don't want to let you down

Girl, I know how you feel about me
And I'm not knocking the way you feel
But as you can see, baby, time is not on our side
(We can change the world, we can do it, girl)
And for that reason, we can't be together
But I can assure you one day we will prove them all wrong
But in the meantime, love, let's just walk away from here
And be friends (Friends forever)
Soon enough, it will be
Just you and me
Ooh ooh
