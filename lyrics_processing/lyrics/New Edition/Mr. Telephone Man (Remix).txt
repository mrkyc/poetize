Hello, Kim?
What!
What's wrong Bob
I couldn't get through
What'd she say?
I couldn't get through
I don't know, either she's not home, or there's something wrong with my phone
Well just try it again, that's all
Yeah, she's gotta be there
(Yeah, man, I don't think there's anything wrong with your phone
Maybe you just dialed the wrong number or something)
We'll just call her again Bobby, she gotta answer sooner or later
Okay I'll call her

She said, "Hello, may I help you please?"
I told her something must be wrong with my phone
'Cause my baby wouldn't hang up on me
