Girl, I'm leaving you again
And I thought I'd tell you when
I know how you must feel
But if your love's for real
You'd try to understand
That I'm in popular demand

When we first met
I told you how it would be
And you said you understood
And that you'd still keep loving me
Now it seems you're changing your mind
Each and every time
Girl, one day, leave with me
You just wait and see
But as of today, it has to be this way
Oh, oh, whoa

Girl, I'm leaving you again
And I thought I'd tell you when
I know how you must feel
But if your love's for real
You'd try to understand
That I'm in popular demand

For you and I to stay together
Forever and a day
