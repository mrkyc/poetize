You see, what I do, is, I try to make you dance, you know?
When you hear this, that, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I try to make you go to the dance floor, and, you know
Listen to my girl Missy say something like, come on, uh

I'ma stick closer to your side than a beeper
You don't have to worry 'bout me
And you won't miss me like Monifah (Heh, heh)
P-U-F-F (Uh-huh), D-A-double D-(That's right)-Y
You be makin' hits like the old factory (Why, thank you)
And I..."Hit You With Da Hee"
Hee-hee-hee-hee-how
"Hit You Wit Da Hee"
This is how I get down, alright?
With Ronnie, Bobby, Johnny, Ricky, and Mike
(Don't forget about Ralph)

Lady, I know I've been acting strange (Come on)
It seems to me you're tired of playing games
I've been around, had girls here and there (This is the remix)
I did you wrong, but I'll give my life to make it right

I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight (OW)
And it's been on my mind
You don't have to worry
(You don't have to worry)
I'm gonna make it right (No)
I'll be on your side (No no)
No more lonely nights
You don't have to worry
(This is the remix, come on)

N.E. expertise, please
Here to put the squeeze on the industry fleas getting cheese
Peep these, butter slurs, his and hers Chinchilla furs
Check the Goodfella words
You don't ever have to worry
'Cause I get in ya like Murray
And boo, it's only a light flurry
You're frontin' cattin', you wanna rumble in the satin
In a bad ass suite somewhere in Lower Manhattan

I'm from the street, too, but I gotta eat, too
Won't hesitate to eat you, other than that "glad to meet you"
I spend nights in the Ramada, my honeys stay laced in Escada
Chickens is mad that I got her
Casino style, Gambino type smile
Kiss you before I twist you, on the wax is official
Players on the set, gettin' wet, sippin' Perrier Jouet
So you don't even have to worry yet
I know that things ain't right
Seems like all we do is fight
And it's been on my mind
You don't have to worry
I'm gonna make it right
I'll be on your side
No more lonely nights
You don't have to worry

Eh eh, eh eh, eh

I'll be by your side
I ain't never gonna leave you, baby
