Ooh...ooh-ooh...

Since the day I saw you, baby, I knew you were for me
Always all by myself, I sought your company
All the fellas told me that you played me for a fool
Said I wouldn't hang out, I'd go home right after school

What did I do to you
To make you feel this way?
You said you'd be my baby
Never go away, go away

How could you leave when I need you, baby?

Spent all my time, baby, just working on my form
Trying to improve myself so I could give you more
You told me I was turning out the way that I should be
How could I know that you would turn your back on me

To make you feel this way?

Never go away, go away
