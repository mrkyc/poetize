Now we're the poppin' kings
So we must do our thing
Make the ladies talk and scream
Being lean, clean, and mean
Put your pride aside
And let's go with the flow
Let your feelings show
Let's just rock this party
Shock this party
Take this party
Let's make it to the party
Now I heard a word
That the party will be jumpin'
And the bass will be thumpin'
Lookin' forward to somethin' heavy
Maybe we can leave the scene
With the girls of our dreams
And we can all talk together
Forever and ever, and ever
We said that we would get enough
But we can't because our soul's been touched
So let's do what we came here to
And prove that all this talk is true

Shake it!
Don't break it
It took your mother nine months to make it
Oh, shake it!
And don't break it
Ha, ha, ha, ha
