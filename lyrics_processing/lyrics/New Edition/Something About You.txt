Bobby: "Ay yo, Rizz, what we gon' do now?"
Ralph: "Yo, I think it's time for us to drop some of that country-western funk folk meets NE"

Over and over and over I try
To get you off of my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feeling I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feeling I get when I can't get enough

Something about you, babe
Makes me feel the way I do
Know that I love you, babe
But you treat me like a fool
Wanna tell me babe
How I fit into your plan
Don't you deceive me, baby
I'm just trying to be your man, 'cause

Oh nobody ever made me feel this way
And oh I think and dream about you every day
And oh if I could only get you out of my mind
And oh but every time I try to run away

Over and over and over I try
To get you off of my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feeling I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feeling I get when I can't get enough
Something about you, babe

Something about you, baby
Changed the way I looked at me
Is it obsession baby
Or just curiosity
You're takin' advantage, baby
Of my sensitivity
Do what you wanna, babe
Just give back my sanity

Oh, no other love's affected me before
Girl, you change the rules but I come back for more
I'm a player in this game I'll never win
This addictive love's about to do me in
Over and over and over I try
To get you off of my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feeling I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feeling I get when I can't get enough
(Something about you)
Over and over and over I try
To get you off of my mind
But I can't win the fight

There's something about you, baby (over and over)
When I think about you, baby (over and over)
(I think about you)
There's no doubt about it, baby
I know it's suicide to stay
But baby everytime I try to run away
Oh, it's just something about you, baby

Over and over and over I try
To get you off of my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feeling I know
When I'm losing in love
It's the feeling I get when I can't get enough
Something about you, babe
Something about you, baby
Something about you, babe
(Over and over, over and over, over and over, over and over)
Something about you

Over and over and over I try
To get you off of my mind
But I can't win the fight
There's a feeling I know
When I'm losing in love
