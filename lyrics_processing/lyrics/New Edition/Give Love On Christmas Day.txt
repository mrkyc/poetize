People making lists, buying special gifts
Taking time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day (On Christmas Day)
Oh, even the ones who have everything
Still need to feel what your heart can bring
Give love on Christmas Day (On Christmas Day)
No greater gift is there than love

People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day (On Christmas Day)
Oh, each one of us wishes all of you
All of the dreams that you dream come true
Give love on Christmas Day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
