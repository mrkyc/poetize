Yeah, I can't deny it
On the inside, I'm slowly dying
But with a little love, it'll be alright
Just give me one more day
I promise I'll make it up to you
I never meant to hurt you, baby
Just trust me, listen

I can't deny it, that you got me crying, you see
And I'm, I'm slowly dying, so we can't give up trying to be
With a little love, it will be all right
With a little kiss, let me hold you tight
With a little peace, it could be fine
And baby, don't you leave me tonight

I just need one more day, and I won't make you cry
Darling believe, and baby don't say goodbye
Look in my heart, and I won't tell you no lies
Just one more day, and loving me will be fine

People tell me that true love is blind
But I'm trying to prove that true love is kind
All that I want is to make things right
So won't you be my baby tonight
