I've been a fan since I met you in the lobby
And hopefully you'll end up over my place

Until you put your pretty hand up on my shoulder
I wanna touch, I wanna kiss, I wanna hold ya
Yeah, I really wanna get you hot tonight (Come on)

Get the hook up in the future (Rock wit'cha)
Baby, you choose the night, whatever you like
And I'ma pick you up on time

But you'd be a fool if you don't want to (Rock, rock wit' me)
'Cause I guarantee that if you with me
You gon' be feelin' how you supposed to be
