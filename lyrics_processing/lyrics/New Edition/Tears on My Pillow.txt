You don't remember me, but I remember you
'Twas not so long ago you broke my heart in two
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart, caused by you (You)

If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart, caused by you

Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
She'll fill your heart with joy

If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart, caused by you (You)
