I've been away for much too long
I hope you still feel I belong
I didn't mean to cause you pain
Nothin' to lose, much more to gain
So can you stand the rain?

Let me talk to 'em, Ralph
Just when I thought that we were through
I found my way right back to you
I can't change what happened in the past
And won't promise this time it'll last
Can you stand the rain?
(Can you stand the rain?)
Tell me, baby, can you stand the rain?

So, on the story goes (On the story goes)
Heaven only knows (Heaven only knows)
The road of life will turn (The road of life, the road of life)
A lesson we will learn (Will turn, lessons we will learn)
And no one knows but fate how we'll end (Tell me)
People who know
They say you can't go home again
But if you ask me
I'm happy to be home again

Will our story end like a fairytale
Or just another heartbreak
Only time will tell
(Can you stand the rain?)

But if you ask me

No matter where, no matter how
No turning back, no stopping now
'Cause we may never ever pass this way again
Just give me one more chance, let me come home again
So, on the story goes
Heaven only knows (Only knows)
The road of life will turn
A lesson we will learn
And no one knows but fate how we'll end (Oh, oh)
People who know

But if you ask me
I'm happy to be home again
(Home again)
