I'm singing these words to define
How much you to mean to me, (you mean to me)
And I've got to confess that all the emptiness
Has gone out of my life 'cause you complete me
Chorus
So don't hesitate to call out my name
I'll catch a flight or a train
I want to make my way to you
Well I could be ten thousand miles away
I won't delay my love is true let me show and prove
I will walk from LA to Chicago
Where ever you want me
I will swim from NY to Montego
Where ever you want me
Don't you know that there's no limit
Please believe that
There's no limit
There's no place in the world that I won't go for you, yoooouuuuuu, ooooo
Verse 2
You're all of the thoughts in my mind
I can't decide without you here with me (without you here with me)
You're the air I breathe, (you are the air I breathe)
My better half, I say now you're my every
Every, every, every, every, everything
Chorus
So don't hesitate to call out my name
I'll catch a flight or a train
Make my way to you (Make my way to you)
I could be ten thousand miles away
I won't delay my love is true let me show and prove
I will walk from LA to Chicago
Where ever you want me
I will swim from NY to Montego
Where ever you want me
Don't you know that there's no limit
There's no limit
There's no limit
There's no limit
There's no place in the world that I won't go for you, yoooouuuuuu, ooooo
I won't go, no, no, no, no, no, nooooooo
No place I won't go for you Baaaaabbbbbyyyyyyyy
