Can't tell me that I can't make it
I can't make it
Can't tell me that I can't make it
'Cause I made it, oh
Can't tell me that I can't make it
Can't make it
'Cause I made it
I made it, oh

Sometimes it takes your heart to break
So you can know how much it takes to free a soul
You wander around from place to place
But then figure out where to go
Can't nobody tell you nothing 'bout what you know

Can't tell me that I can't make it (No)
Can't make it (No, no)
Can't tell me that I can't make it (Can't tell)
'Cause I made it (Oh, no)
Can't tell me that I can't make it (Oh)
Can't make it
'Cause I made it
I made it, oh

See, sometimes it comes from out of the blue
That drowning really changes you
You wonder when will the wilderness end
But then you close your eyes to pray
You always have a light to find your way

Can't tell me that I can't make it
I can't make it (Just find your way)
Can't tell me that I can't make it (Can't tell me, no)
'Cause I made it, oh
Can't tell me that I can't make it (Can't tell me, no)
Can't make it
'Cause I made it ('Cause I)
I made it, oh (I made it, tell 'em it, oh)

Been down that road a few times before
Been lost at sea, but now I found the shore
My heart was aching, but my peace is real
Because I felt the things I had to feel, oh-ooh

Can't tell me that I can't make it
I can't make it
Can't tell me that I can't make it
'Cause I made it, oh
Can't tell me that I can't make it
Can't make it
'Cause I made it, tell 'em
