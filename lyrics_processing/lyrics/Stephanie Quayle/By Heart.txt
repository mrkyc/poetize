I wanna know the way you take your coffee in the morning
Do you drink it black?
And I wanna know the station that you're playing in your car
When you're driving fast
Do you fall asleep with the TV on?
What day of the week do you call your mom?
Don't leave out any information
I'm just saying

I wanna know you like my drive home
Know you like Sweet Caroline, ba-ba-ba
I wanna memorize the look in your eyes
You get when you're looking into mine
Know you like my favorite movie
Don't know what you're doing to me, but
I don't wanna leave any question marks
I wanna know you, baby, I wanna know you by heart

I wanna know the number on your jersey that you wore
When you were seventeen
And I wanna know who let you go
What made you who you were the day that you met me
And tell me how you like to be kissed
Tell me what your love language is
And don't leave out any information
I'm just sayin'
You might also like
I wanna know you like my drive home
Know you like Sweet Caroline, ba-ba-ba
I wanna memorize the look in your eyes
You get when you're looking into mine
Know you like my favorite movie
Don't know what you're doing to me, but
I don't wanna leave any question marks
I wanna know you, baby, I wanna know you by heart

Like the ocean knows the coast and the moon knows the stars
Baby, I just wanna know, I just wanna know who you are
By heart

I wanna know you like my drive home
Know you like Sweet Caroline, ba-ba-ba
I wanna memorize the look in your eyes
You get when you're looking into mine
Know you like my favorite movie
Don't know what you're doing to me, but
I don't wanna leave any question marks
I wanna know you, baby, I wanna know you by heart

I wanna know you by heart
