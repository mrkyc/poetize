I packed up your last box of clothes
I made sure your mama got home
It's kinda messed up everybody knows
But no one will say how long they've known

Was it from the beginning? Was it the whole time?
Four years together, were you ever mine?
Don't know the answer, guess I gotta guess
What would you tell me if you had the chance?

Would you ask for forgiveness, tell me the truth
Or look me in the eye, lie "I love you"?
Would you leave me questionin' everything you ever said
If you knew it was your last breath?

It's been months since I saw your face
And all these stories still ain't straight

Yeah, I keep findin' pieces, no rhyme or reason
Screamin' at the Devil, prayin' to Jesus
Guess I'll never know, yeah, you took it to your grave
If you knew it was comin', what would you say?

Would you ask for forgiveness, tell me the truth
Or look me in the eye, lie "I love you"?
Would you leave me questionin' everything you ever said?
If you knew it was your last
Time to come clean and make things right
Make good on your dreams, yeah, you sold me this life
Would you leave me with the same mountain of regret
If you knew it was your last breath?

Would you ask for forgiveness, tell me the truth
Or look me in the eye, lie "I love you"?
Would you leave me questionin' everything you ever said?
