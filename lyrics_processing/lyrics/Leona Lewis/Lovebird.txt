Oh
Ooh

I would lay down next to you
Stay in bed all afternoon
We were birds of a feather
We were always together
And I never will forget
All the little things you said
In that beautiful summer
Used to call me your lovebird
But the time went on, the wind has blown
And I've grown
And I started a feeling
That my wings have been broken

And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay

So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum-dum diddy
And I'll miss you everyday
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
You might also like
I want the world at my feet
Even if it's bittersweet
I wanna stand on my own and
Hold my heart in my own hands
'Cause I've begun to see that you and me
Are different breeds
So I gotta be leaving
Gotta get back to breathing

And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay

So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum-dum diddy
And I'll miss you everyday
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum-dum diddy

And you'll always be
A part of me
You made me who I am
But I gotta say, I'm not afraid to test my wing span
'Cause they say if you love something, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Open up the gate
'Cause your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away, yeah
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage, ooh
Sing my song so pretty, dum-dum diddy
My song, my song
And I'll miss you everyday Oh
'Cause there's nothing left to say, I'll miss you
Oh, gotta sing my song so pretty, dum-dum diddy

Oh, hey
Hey
