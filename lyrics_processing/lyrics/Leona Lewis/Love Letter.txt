I can't wait for the day to end
So I can finally see your face again
We'll find a way if this wish comes true tonight, mm

Even though I
Never met you
I still miss you
I can feel you in my dreams
And I hope that
When you wake up
Just maybe you'll remember me

And now I believe that this is fate
'Cause, baby, we belong together
I know everything is gonna be okay
Just as long as we have each other
Through the sunshine and through the rain
I know that it'll last forever
Just last night, I stayed up late
And I wrote you a love letter
Wrote you a love letter, ooh, oh

Tell me, am I insane?
I set your letter on the window pane
I thought of you as I let it fly away, and away
You might also like
Even though I
Never met you
I still miss you
I can see you in my dreams
And I hope that
When you read this
Just maybe you'll remember me

And now I believe that this is fate
'Cause, baby, we belong together
I know everything is gonna be okay
Just as long as we have each other
Through the sunshine and through the rain
I know that it'll last forever
Just last night, I stayed up late
And I wrote you a love letter
Wrote you a love letter

I know that we'll always be together
Together, together, together (Ooh, oh)

Even though I
Never met you
I still miss you
I can see you in my dreams
And I hope that
When you read this
Just maybe you'll remember me, hey
And now I believe that this is fate (Oh, oh)
'Cause, baby, we belong together (Yeah, yeah)
I know everything is gonna be okay
Just as long as we have each other
Through the sunshine and through the rain
(I know that) I know that it'll last forever
Just last night, I stayed up late
And I wrote you a love letter
Wrote you a love letter (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know that we'll always be together (We'll be togther)
We'll be together, together (Together)
We'll always be, oh

We'll always be
Oh, ah, ah, ooh
