Let me take these clothes off
Throw them in the fire
Blowing hair in the wind
Let spirit guide me
No limitations
It's a brand new day
It's a new horizon
This is who I am
This is what I want

Oh, I'm breaking free
I'm taking the leap
These borders are deep
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
These mountains are steep
But there's no stopping me
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me

The eh eh eh eh eh eh
The essence of me, the essence of me
The eh eh eh eh eh eh
The essence of me, the essence
You might also like
I've been everything
You wanted me to be
Let you chip away
At my self-esteem
Oh, you spoke so loud
I couldn't hear myself
And all your ugly judgments
No longer pin me down
You can't pin me down
They can't pin me down

Oh, I'm breaking free
I'm taking the leap
These borders are deep
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
These mountains are steep
But there's no stopping me
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me

The eh eh eh eh eh eh
The essence of me, the essence of me
The eh eh eh eh eh eh
The essence of me, the essence
I'm standing at the fences
I still gotta overcome
Everyday a little victory
Take them one by one
I'm waking up stronger
Putting on my gloves
Now its on
Bring it on, bring it on

Oh, I'm breaking free
I'm taking the leap
These borders are deep
But I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
These mountains are steep
But there's no stopping me
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me

The eh eh eh eh eh eh
The essence of me, the essence of me
The eh eh eh eh eh eh
The essence of me, the essence
Got nothing to fear
