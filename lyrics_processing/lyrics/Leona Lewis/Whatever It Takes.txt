People say love comes and goes, but
They don't understand what they don't know
'Cause what I feel starts deep inside
It's planted like a seed that springs into life

They say it's not right (Oh) and we move too fast
But they don't know the meaning of what we have (Oh)

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind to what other people say
Whenever it is in my life, know that I will be on time
'Cause you know why, there's no standing in our way

Da, da-da, da-da-da
Da, da-da, da-da-da-da
Da, da-da, da-da-da
Da, da-da, da-da-da-da

When you're far and we're apart
I'm really missing you, I wanna be where you are

They say it's not right (It's not right) and it won't last (It won't last)
They never would believe in what we have (Oh)

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind to what other people say
Whenever it is in my life, I'll be on time
'Cause you know why, there's no standing in my way

And if you're lost, I'll come and find you
'Cause without you, I'll break down and cry
And you know I, I wanna surround you
With all my love (Ooh)

Is, I'll fly - takes, I'll try
Baby, don't pay no mind
Pay no mind to what other people say
Is in my life, be on time
You know I'll be on time
You know why, there's no standing in our way
Wherever it is, I'll fly
(Whatever it takes) Whatever it takes, I'll try (Ooh)
Pay no mind to what other people say
Whenever it is in my life, know that I will be on time
'Cause you know why, there's no standing in my way
