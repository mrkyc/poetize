Someone once told me
That you have to choose
What you win or lose
You can't have everything
Don't you take chances
You might feel the pain
Don't you love in vain
'Cause love won't set you free

I could stand by the side
And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy
But safe as could be

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I'm just tryna be happy
I just wanna be happy, yeah
You might also like
Holding on tightly
Just can't let it go
Just trying to play my role
Slowly disappear, oh
But all these days
They feel like they're the same
Just different faces
Different names
Get me out of here

Well, I can't stand by the side
Ooh, no
And watch this life pass me by
Pass me by

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge?
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
'Cause I'm just tryna be happy
Oh, happy
Oh
So many turns that I can't see
Like I'm a stranger on this road
But don't say victim
Don't say anything

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge?
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I just wanna be happy

Hey, yeah, happy, whoa, oh
I just wanna be (Oh)
I just wanna be
Happy, oh
