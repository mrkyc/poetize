The flowers are faded now
Along with your letters
They will never see the light of day
'Cause I'll never take them out
And there's no turning back
It's for the better
Baby, I deserve more than empty words and promises
I believed everything you said
And I gave you the best I had
Oh

So take a bow
'Cause you've taken everything else
You played the part
And like a star, you played it so well
Take a bow
'Cause this scene is coming to an end
I gave you love
All you give me was pretend
So now...
Take a bow

The future's about to change
Before you know it, the curtain closes
Take a look around
There's no one in the crowd
I'm throwing away the pain
And you should know that your performance, it made me stronger now
You might also like
So take a bow
'Cause you've taken everything else
You played the part
And like a star, you played it so well
Take a bow
'Cause this scene is coming to an end
I gave you love
All you give me was pretend
So now...
Take a bow

Well it must of been slight of hand
'Cause I still can't understand
How I could never see
Just what a fool believed
But the lies they start to show
Tell me how it feels to know right now that I won't be around
So baby, before I put you out

Take a bow
'Cause you've taken everything else (You've taken everything else)
You played the part
And like a star, you played it so well (So well)
Take a bow
'Cause the scene is coming to an end
I gave you love
All you give me was pretend
So now...
Take a bow
'Cause you've taken everything else
You played the part (I gave you all my love)
And like a star you played it so well (I gave you all my love)
Take a bow
Cause the scene is coming to an end
I gave you love
All you give me was pretend
So now...
Take a bow
