You let me down, can't fix it now
Thought I could count on you to be around
You bring me down, down, down, way down

What is the problem?
Are you taking me seriously?
Is it a joke to you?
Or maybe I'm a fool
Why am I trying?
So hard to be the girl that you need
How is this fair to me?
When you break through

This is too much
Don't call it love
You are the reason it's so hard to trust
Boy, this ain't what I wanted
Now it's got to stop

You let me down, can't fix you now
Thought I could count on you to be around
You bring me down, down, down, way down
You might also like
No more tears
Why did I let you have so much control?
I gave my all to you
And you pushed me away
Why are you here? Oh
Don't you see I'm letting you go
The damage is done, baby
I have nothing to say

It's gone too far
Don't know who you are
I think it's better that we are apart
Boy, I know who I am
And I know what you're not

You let me down, can't fix you now
Thought I could count on you to be around
You bring me down, down, down, way down
You let me down, thought I had found
Someone to catch me when I hit the ground
You bring me down, down, down, way down

Would you like it if I
Did the same thing to
You and I lasted
Walking years in my shoes?
Boy, there's no excuse
Cause of what you did
There's no me and you
Would you like it if I
Did the same thing
You would not like
Walking in time?
Boy, there's no excuse
That's who you are
And I'm so over you

You let me down, can't fix you now
Thought I could count on you to be around
You bring me down, down, down, way down
You let me down, thought I had found
Someone to catch me when I hit the ground
You bring me down, down, down, way down

Down
Down
Stop bringing me
Stop bringing me
Down
