Uh
(Konvict)

There's a first time for everything
It's definitely one of them nights (Nights)
I knew when I looked in his eyes (Eyes)
That he was gonna be trouble for me, oh
I never wanted to lie (Lie)
I knew that my baby would cry
If he knew what we were doin'
But if his love don't pass the test (The test)
I gotta get it from somewhere else
Well, I'm grown and I need a man
Hope he understands

Forgive me, baby
But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doin' me, myself
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh)
Hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh)
Hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh)
I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey

Been a long time since I did something good for myself (-Self)
But why should I be put through hell (Hell)
When he's doin' what he wanna do?
And I finally found somebody else (Else)
Who really wants to make me feel
Things that I've been missing so long
And his love always passed the test (The test)
It's a shame I had to look somewhere else
Well, I'm grown and I need a man
I just hope that he understands

Forgive me, baby
But I gotta take a chance tonight (Oh, well I'm taking)
So I'm doin' me, myself
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone (Alone)
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh)
Hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh)
Hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh)
I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey

Forgive me, but I need to be loved too
Forgive me, but I can't wait around for you
Forgive me if I found a man who understands
Just what I need, oh (Show me the love)
Forgive me, but I need to be loved too
Forgive me if I can't wait around for you
Forgive me if I found a man who understands
Forgive me, baby
But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doin' me, myself (Woo)
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone (Alone)
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh)
Hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh) (Won't you forgive me?)
Hope you forgive me, hey (Oh, oh)
I can't wait no more
Man, I really hope, hope you forgive me, hey
But I gotta take a chance tonight
So I'm doin' me, myself (I'm doin')
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone (Oh, ooh)
