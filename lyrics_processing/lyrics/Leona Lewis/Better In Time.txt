Ooh
Mm, mm

It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to (Ah, ah, ah)
See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through (Ah, ah, ah)

Going, coming
Thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
And now I realize that I really didn't know (Ah, ah, ah)
If you didn't notice, you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All that I know is, I'ma be okay, yeah (Ah, ah, ah)

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, oh yeah
It'll all get better in time (Oh)
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV (No)
Without something there to remind me, mm-hmm (Ah, ah, ah)
Was it all that easy, mmh?
To just put aside your feelings (Ah, ah, ah)

If I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings, but that's the path
I believe in, and I know that time will heal it (Ah, ah, ah)
If you didn't notice, boy, you meant everything
Quickly I'm learnin', ooh, to love again
All that I know is, I'ma be okay, yeah (Ah, ah, ah)

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, oh yeah
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to, ooh
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me (No more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free (Ah, ah, ah)
And live my life how it should be (No no no, no no no)
No matter how hard it is, I'll be fine without you
Yes, I will!
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too, ohh-oh, oh
It'll all get better in time (Ooh, oh)
And even though I really loved you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to, yes, I do
It'll all get better in time (Ohh, oh)
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too, yes
It'll all get better in time (Ohh, oh)
And even though I really loved you
Gonna smile 'cause I deserve to, ooh
