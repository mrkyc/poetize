Baby, I'm staring at a piece of us
Shattered on the sidewalk
Tragic, broken like a China doll
Burning like a gunshot

My heart was beating, and so was yours
We threw each other down on the floor
My heart is breaking, it's made of glass
Guess anything that's good never ever lasts

So baby, if you love me, let me know
'Cause everything that hurts, you've hurt before
You're about to tear this love apart
And break another glassheart
So baby, if you love me, let me know
'Cause every time we touch, touch turning cold
Promise that we'll never fall apart
And I'll love you with my glassheart (Heart)
And I'll love you with my glassheart (Heart)
And I'll love you with my glassheart

Right now, I'm standing in our empty room
Staring out the window
I hear music that we used to make
Boy, play me that crescendo
You might also like
My heart was beating, and so was yours
We threw each other down on the floor
My heart is breaking, it's made of glass
Guess anything that's good never ever lasts

So baby, if you love me, let me know
'Cause everything that hurts, you've hurt before
You're about to tear this love apart
And break another glassheart
So baby, if you love me, let me know
'Cause every time we touch, touch turning cold
Promise that we'll never fall apart
And I'll love you with my glassheart (Heart)
(Heart) And I'll love you with my glassheart

Oh
Promise that we'll never fall apart (Oh), fall apart
And I'll love you with my glassheart (Oh, oh, oh)
And I'll love you with my glassheart

So baby, if you love me, let me know
'Cause everything that hurts, you've hurt before
You're about to tear this love apart
And break another glassheart
So baby, if you love me, let me know
'Cause every time we touch, touch turning cold
Promise that we'll never fall apart
And I'll love you with my glassheart (Heart)
