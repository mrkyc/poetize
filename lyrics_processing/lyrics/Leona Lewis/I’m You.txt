How many times are you gonna take it?
Look in my eyes
Help me make this make sense
Night after night (night after night), you sat up and cried
Wondering when you're gonna see this clearer
You don't even realize
That at this very moment
You're talking to yourself in the mirror

It's true
So you think I'm strong, but you're feeling that you're weak
Baby, I'm you
But we're one in the same, so you're just as strong as me
Baby, I'm you
And we deserve better, it's time for us to leave
You know what to do
'Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
Baby, I'm you

Oh, you're not crazy
But they finally realized that you and I is all the help you need
So why are we sitting here on the floor? (Listen to me)
We ain't crying no more
I am your soul
I am your heart
My strength is yours (Oh, my strength is yours)
You might also like
Baby, it's true
So you think I'm strong, but you're feeling that you're weak
Baby, I'm you
But we're one in the same, so you're just as strong as me
Baby, I'm you
And we deserve better, it's time for us to leave
You know what to do
'Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
Baby, I'm you

So pick yourself up right now
We've been here too long
We've overstated the love
That might have been
It's been a long time gone, gone
So wipe away the tears
Ain't nothing for us here
The time has come to move on, oh
Baby, we deserve better
And we're far too strong
To let this go on
Baby, I'm you
So you think I'm strong, but you're feeling that you're weak
Baby, I'm you
But we're one in the same, so you're just as strong as me
Baby, I'm you
And we deserve better, it's time for us to leave
You know what to do
'Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
Baby, I'm you
Baby, I'm you
