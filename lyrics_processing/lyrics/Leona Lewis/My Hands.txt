I wake in the morning
Tired of sleeping
Get in the shower
And make my bed alone
I put on my make up
Talking to the mirror
Ready for a new day
Without you
And I walk steady on my feet
I talk; my voice obeys me
I go out at night
Sleep without the lights
And I do all of the things I have to
Keeping you off my mind
But when I think I'll be alright
I am always wrong, 'cause...

(My hands)
Don't wanna start again
(My hands)
No, they don't wanna understand
(My hands)
They just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find
(My hands)
They only agree to hold
(Your hands)
And they don't wanna be without
(Your hands)
And they will not let me go
No, they will not let me go
You might also like
I talk about you now
And go a day without crying
I go out with my friends now
I stay home all alone
And I don't see you everywhere
And I can say your name easily
I laugh a bit louder
Without you
And I see different shades now
And I, I'm almost never afraid now
But when I think I'll be okay
I am always wrong, 'cause...

(My hands)
Don't wanna start again
(My hands)
No they don't wanna understand
(My hands)
They just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find
(My hands)
They only agree to hold
(Your hands)
No, they don't wanna be without
(Your hands)
And they will not let me go
No, they will not let me go
Sometimes I wake
I see them reaching out for you
Quietly break
Whatever shields I spent so long building up
I cannot fake
'Cause when they cry, I'm unspoken
They miss holding my baby
My hands
No, they don't wanna understand
They just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find

(My hands)
(Your hands)
They don't wanna be without
(Your hands)
And they will not let me go
No, they will not let me go
(My hands)
Don't wanna start again
(My hands)
No, they don't wanna understand
(My hands)
They just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find
(My hands)
They only agree to hold
(Your hands)
No, they don't wanna be without
(Your hands)
And they will not let me go
No, they will not let me go
No, no
