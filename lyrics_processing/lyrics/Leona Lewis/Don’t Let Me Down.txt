Fork in the road
Looking both ways, I
Don't know which way to go
What do I count on?
Do I take the road less traveled
Or the one I already know?
And no, I'm not traveling alone
I got my heart in my hand, and
You can bet I'm holding it close
Don't wanna climb, don't wanna fall
Don't know where to start it all
I can start by taking it slow

'Cause I need a hero
I got a mirror
Looking inside of my soul
If I need a hero
I got my mirror
Got to go on with the show
I got my ear to the ground
That's the sound of my train comin' 'round
This is a chance for us to be heard loud
It's you and me and it's our time now
Don't let me down
You might also like
Don't let me down
Don't let me down now
Don't let me down
Don't let me down now

People
This is what you're living your life for
Fighter
That's your name (That's your name)
Trying to hide, but it's obvious you're a survivor
Believer
Don't let the travel in the road
That look in your eyes puts fire in the heart of the cold (World)
Got a marathon to try again
I'm not even tryin' to win
I'm just glad I'm not alone

'Cause I need a hero
I got a mirror
Looking inside of my soul
If I need a hero
I got my mirror
And I go on with the show
I got my ear to the ground
That's the sound of my train comin' 'round
This is a chance for us to be heard loud
It's you and me and it's our time now
Don't let me down
Don't you let me down
Promise you won't let me down
Don't you let me down
Promise you won't let me down

You've been running so alone
I see you (I see you)
Told you we could change the world
And I believe it's true
There's nothing now to hold us down
I found
My pains
And the sound of your heart led the way

I got my ear to the ground
That's the sound of my train comin' 'round (Comin' round)
This is a chance for us to be heard loud
It's you and me and it's our time now
Don't let me down
Don't you let me down (Don't let me down)
Promise you won't let me down (Don't let me down now)
Don't you let me down (Don't let me down now)
Promise you won't let me down (Don't let me down now)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down now
Don't let me down
