Certain, genuine, honest, positive
Right, definite, sincere
Growth, vitality, truth, humanity
That's not what's happening here
Oooh, oooh, this is real life
Oooh, oooh, this is real life

I'm sitting here waiting, wondering where you been
Don't you know you're late again?
Sitting here thinking, figuring you would call
The phone don't ring at all
I'm not a girl who is living in a fantasy world
So tell me, are we fiction or fact?
'Cause right now I gotta know (Gotta know)
I wanna know where we're at

Get a grip, baby, we're no rehearsal
It's not a game, we are not playing virtual
When are you going to wake up and realize
This is real life, this is real life?
Half-hearted will never be true love
How can almost ever be enough?
I tell you straight up, not telling you twice (You twice)
This is real life, uh, this is real life (Real life)
You might also like
You're blowing hot and cold
And I don't know where you're coming from
What planet are you living on?
And I'm not the girl of a type who will forgive and forget
(Have I, have I got your full attention yet?)
I'm not a girl who is living in a big dream world
This time there's no compromise
So if you want me for good
You better open your eyes

Certain, genuine, honest, positive
Right, definite, sincere
Growth, vitality, truth, humanity
That's not what's happening here
Oooh, oooh, this is real life
Oooh, oooh, this is real life

Get a grip, baby, we're no rehearsal
It's not a game, we are not playing virtual
When are you going to wake up and realize
This is real life, this is real life?
Half-hearted will never be true love
How can almost ever be enough?
I tell you straight up, not telling you twice (You twice)
This is real life, uh, this is real life (Real life)
Get a grip, baby, we're no rehearsal
It's not a game, we are not playing virtual
When are you going to wake up and realize
This is real life, this is real life?
Half-hearted will never be true love
How can almost ever be enough?
I tell you straight up, not telling you twice (You twice)
This is real life, uh, this is real life (Real life)
Get a grip, baby, we're no rehearsal
It's not a game, we are not playing virtual
When are you going to wake up and realize
This is real life, this is real life?

It's up to you, come on

Get a grip, baby, we're no rehearsal
It's not a game, we are not playing virtual
When are you going to wake up and realize
This is real life, this is real life?
Half-hearted will never be true love
How can almost ever be enough?
I tell you straight up, not telling you twice (You twice)
This is real life, uh, this is real life (Real life)
