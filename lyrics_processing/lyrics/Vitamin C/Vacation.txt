Come on, come on, come on (Let's go!)
Come on, come on (Let's go!)
Come on, come on, come on (Let's go!)
Come on, come on (Let's go!)

Vacation, need a little sun
To break up all the frustration and turn it into love
Ain't nobody gonna tell us what we gonna do
Because today it's up to me and you

Temptation comin' up to me
A little relaxation and I'll be great to be
Come on and weeky weeky loo and don't be late
It's gonna start now
Kick it back, kick it back, kick it back to the track
Kick it back, kick it back, kick it back to the max

Vacation's where I wanna be
Party on my beach where the fun is free
We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate
'Cause I need a break, I need a vacation
You might also like
Vibrations need to get me some
And drive out all my complications and turn them into love
Ain't nobody gonna tell us where we gonna be
Because today, today it's you and me

Vacation's what I wanna do
Party on my beach, fun for me and you
We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate
Repeat after me, "I need a vacation"

Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
I wanna be where the fun is free
So come with me

Vacation's where I wanna be
Party on my beach where the fun is free
We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate
'Cause I need a break, I need a vacation
Vacation's where I wanna be
Party on my beach where the fun is free
We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate
Repeat after me, "I need a vacation"
I need a (Vacation)
Come on and (Vacation)
I need a (Vacation)
Come on (Vacation)
Let's go!
Vacation's where I wanna be
Party on my beach where the fun is free
We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate
'Cause I need a break, I need a vacation
Vacation's where I wanna be
Party on my beach where the fun is free
We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate
