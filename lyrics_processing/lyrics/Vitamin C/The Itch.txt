(Itch)
(Ha-ha)
(Ah)

Don't wanna hurt you (hurt you, baby)
You think you love me, but you don't really know me
Don't wanna hurt you (hurt you, baby)
Wanna go ride, not a backseat drive

(Ah, ooh) I, I, I, I need
(Ah, ooh) Something inside that you can't provide me

I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I think I'm starting to twitch again
And I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again
I feel the itch again

I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch (ah)
I-i-itch (ah), i-i-i-i-itch
You might also like
Don't want to hurt you (hurt you, baby)
You can hug me, but you can't really hold me
You know what I do (what I do), and it's crazy
Don't wanna be cold, but I'm out of control

(Ah, ooh) I, I, I, I should
(Ah, ooh) Wish I could, but I can't be good

I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I think I'm starting to twitch again (itch again)
And I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again (I feel it)
I feel the itch, I feel the itch again

I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch (ah)
I-i-itch (ah), i-i-i-i-itch

'Cause I want to go down
Wanna feel my heart pound
Don't you know that I get restless?
You can't reach where I need scratching
So I'm feelin' the itch again
(Itch)
(Itch)
(I-i-itch)
(Ah, ooh) I, I, I, I need
(Ah, ooh) Something inside that you can't provide me

I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again
I think I'm starting to twitch again (itch again)
And I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again (I feel it)
I feel the itch (itch)
I'm feeling the itch again
I need to get tricked again (all over again)
I'm starting to twitch again
I feel the itch again (yeah, yeah)
I think I'm starting to twitch again
And I need to get tricked again
I'm feeling the itch again (I'm feelin' it)
I feel the itch (yeah, yeah)
I feel the itch again

I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch (ah)
I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch (ah)
I-i-itch, i-i-i-i-itch (ah)
