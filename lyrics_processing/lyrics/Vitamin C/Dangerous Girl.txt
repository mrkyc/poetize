How can I say goodbye?
When you saw underneath my skin?
Please be mine, all the time
I would halfway around the world
I used to be daddy's little girl

You were my hip-hopper
You were my heart-stopper
Yeah you're the only one that makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl

Your baggy jeans, you conquer me
You got my name tattooed on your thigh
So hardcore, I'd die for more
You touch me and left me in this world
You turned me back to daddy's little girl

You were my hip-hopper
You were my heart-stopper
Yeah you're the only one that makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl
You might also like
You are my eye candy
You are my phat daddy
Yeah, you are the only one who makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl

Like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl

I would jump from a plane
Next to you just to land
In your car with the bass turned up loud
Cruising at speeds that the law would never allow

I know all you see is a innocent girl
Around you I'm free like a bird who has just left the ground
And I'm finally around

You were my hip-hopper
You were my heart-stopper
Yeah you're the only one that makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl
You are my eye candy
You are my phat daddy
Yeah, you are the only one who makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl

You were my hip-hopper
You were my heart-stopper
Yeah you're the only one that makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl
