Listen up y'all I got a little story to tell
Straight out from the pierced lips of Razakel
Since I came out the womb mama knew I wasn't quite right
Daddy was a minister I was never good enough in his eyes
So I stayed up late at night with my voodoo dolls and black candles
Hexing and cursing and casting evil spells
Started touchin' myself and fantasizing 'bout the Devil
Started sinnin' left and right so when I died I could burn in Hell
Mama could tell, she got scared and told daddy
They pulled me out my room, sat me down, and started asking...

"Why are you so evil and why do you blaspheme?"
Because I hate your God and I'm possessed you see
The Devil fucks me in my sleep and in my dreams
When I orgasm he strangles me and says I'm his wicked Queen

Come here and take a sip of my murder potion
Feel the effects and put your hate in motion
Poison in your brain, saying God's name in vain
I'm a plague; I'm here to stay and I'ma sin every fuckin' Day
"Double Double Toil And Trouble
Fire Burn And Cauldron Bubble
With the Eye Of A Newt, A Bowel Of A Trout"
I'ma show you what this wicked bitch is really all about
You might also like
You can go ahead and point your fingers at me
Keep in mind I'm that bitch little girlies wanna grow up to be
How the fuck am I a bad influence?
Maybe 'cause I practice self-indulgence not abstinence
Huh, I'm the beginning of a very new breed
Destroying all the sheep and I still got people asking...

"Why are you so evil and why do you blaspheme?"
Because I hate your God and I'm possessed you see
The Devil fucks me in my sleep and in my dreams
When I orgasm he strangles me and says I'm his wicked Queen

All I'm sayin' is death is inevitable
So grab a metal bat and smash in your enemies' skulls
You're only doing the world a small favor
Go make a difference instead of waiting for a false Savior

Come here and take a sip of my murder potion
Feel the effects and put your hate in motion
Poison in your brain, saying God's name in vain
I'm a plague; I'm here to stay and I'ma sin every fuckin' Day
"Double Double Toil And Trouble
Fire Burn And Cauldron Bubble
With the Eye Of A Newt, A Bowel Of A Trout"
I'ma show you what this wicked bitch is really all about
*Moaning*
You're my wicked queen, bitch

Come here and take a sip of my murder potion
Feel the effects and put your hate in motion
Poison in your brain, saying God's name in vain
I'm a plague; I'm here to stay and I'ma sin every fuckin' Day
"Double Double Toil And Trouble
Fire Burn And Cauldron Bubble
With the Eye Of A Newt, A Bowel Of A Trout"
I'ma show you what this wicked bitch is really all about
