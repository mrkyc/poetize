Hell have No fury like a woman scorned ripped and then torn
Deadly like the Damien Thorn
Yes I'm dead but don't you mourn
Your life is meaningless I'm so death obsessed ending lives is what I swore
You've been forewarned
Yes I've developed the instinct to kill
Better tuck your balls back in Ill terminate you test Me I will
The Queen is back so kneel your existence I will steal
It a thrill I love how it feels witness death close makes life so real
Now bring that mother fucking beat in
I keep killing these flows like all of these hoes that I just keep on beatin'
Its an emergency better call some one 911 as your life fades a way
I masturbate with scissors till I cum run rabbit run before My gun hits your temple
I'm unpredictable I'm very temperamental
You better fear Me My motives are detrimental
Estoy muerta adentro, compasion no lo siento

I know you wanna be dead just like Me
Pull out the switchblade Slice precisely
I know you wanna be dead just like Me "muerta"
Just like Me "muerta"
Just like Me "muerta"
I know you wanna be dead just like Me
I fantasize daily and stalk nightly
I know you wanna be dead just like Me "muerta"
Just like Me "muerta"
Just like Me "muerta"
(End of )
You might also likeDead is what I am Nothing inside I could understand
I can give a fuck less I could give a damn
The pain that you bare the pain you could stand
From haven I'm Banned obey all My commands
You can't escape I'll lure you in like a pedophile in a van
I'm the Queen of the damned that wretched harlot
Empty inside My blood runs cold I'm heartless
They all remain so clueless as if
I'm a killer in disguise that you can't see to good to quit
Can't wash it out of My system it deeply inoculated it gleams bright in this world where colors have faded
I'm jaded My ritual's sacred and creative your life's soon to be mine and no body can save it
I'm like Thomas Brown Hewitt when your down in My basement dismember your body and from the ceiling your hangin
The taste of death I crave it it keeps Me motivated I'll leave your body mutilated step closer I'll demonstrate it Yeah

I stand amid roar of a surf tormented shore and I hold within My hand
Grains of golden sand how few yet how they creep through My fingers to the deep
While I weep is this nothing but a dream within a dream
I stand amid roar of a surf tormented shore and I hold within My hand
Grains of golden sand how few yet how they creep through My fingers to the deep
