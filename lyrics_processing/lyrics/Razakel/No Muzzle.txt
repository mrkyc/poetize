Not a white girl but I still rap fast
And color don't matter and that's a fact
I master this craft I'm lyrically strapped
Don't fuck with me
I just might snap
I'm first your last
Don't act don't laugh
Cuz I'll leave you all dead
Heart attack
I'm lookin' (?)
And I just relapsed
(?) de-flatlined, guess who's back
Breathin' life into this track fast
Talent speaks, that's what they lack
I'm treasure you're trash
You crumble you smash
Your heads' spinnin' fast got no time to react
Is this too much for you?
Should I slow it down for you?
...
Fuck you, kick rocks, suck cock
Non stop tick-tock
You're used I'm new
You're not hot, you think you are you're not
I'm risin' to the top
All these hoes fall off
Sob after those whos (pissed off?)
Candy wrappers(or rappers)
Dick riders, clown knockoffs
Hit these mother fuckers with the fast flo'
You claim you're dough
I'm high res I'm macro
Haters are crickets
(?)
Talkin' all night I hear but they don't show
Up to no good when I roll through your hood
Where could they be? I guess no one knows
No where to be found
No where to be seen
Got 'em all hiding, wheres Waldo?
Don't know, don't care, don't give a shit
If I had a dick they would suck it
SKR Bitch, hit it and quit
Swallow don't spit
Get exed out quick
Yes I run shit, fully equipped
I'll crack my whip and make you my bitch
Dominate tricks gonna' make you strip
Follow the script (?)
Strictly for the wicked I remain committed
At least I admit it, you won't catch me slippin'
Never be quittin you're nothin' (?)
You're (?) bitch you know that I'm winnin'
Hate me I crave it I need motivation
And less dedication with no hesitation
These imitations need medication
I'm real as it gets they're just fabrications
Keep hating I'm devistating
They're fading I'm dominating
No (?)
Leave 'em all shaking this (droid Hadie?)
T-T-T-T-The name
Razakel you should know very well
When I see compitition I look at myself
Untouchable flo' so hot
First rates (?) like the devil himself
Nobodies gonna' stop me
Fightin' like Rockie
Takin' over like illuminati
(?)
Don't get sloppy
(?)
Don't mock me
This ain't a hobby
It's air I breathe
Take me for one I don't need company
Disecting these bitches like surgery
I'm takin' their shine, burglary
These mother fuckers wanna see me fall
Wanna see me give up
Wanna see me fail
I'll never prevail
I'm the one and only wicked bitch
Of the southwest
