Speak Now Fake Bxtches Or Forever Hold Your Peace
Or I'll Slice Your Pretty Face up In The Name of The Beast
The Names Razakel And I'm Claiming My Crown
As Queen Of The Wicked Shit So All Bxtches Bow Down
Cause For Years I've Been Examining Without Making A Sound
They Embarrass Themselves And Try To Claim Underground
Well Now's The Time To Shine; The Spot Light Is On Me
First Class Hell Sent To Put Them Out Of Their Misery
Consider This A Blessing As I Choke You Stupid Slut
Cut Your Tummy Up; Finger Fuck Your Guts
Smoke Your Ashes In A Blunt Like What I Don't Give A Fuck
I Can Handle Being Hated, Imitated, But I'm Never Duplicated
(Chorus 1: Razakel)
Just Another Bxtch From Around The Way
And I've Been Silent For Years; Now I Got Somethin' To Say
I'm That Serial Killin' Bxtch Wicked And Proud
And To All You Fake Bxtches I Suggest You Bow Down
To The Sound Of The Underground Ringing In Your Brain
I Got Wicked Desires And Known To Bring The Fuckin' Pain
It Would Be My Honor To Be-Head Bxtches Non-Stop
Chop Chop Cause There's Only Room For One; Razakel Claims The Spot
Mirror Mirror On The Wall
Who's The Most Wicked Of Bxtch All
Oh It's Me, I Own The Spot I Will Forever Kill Bxtches
And Watch Their Bodies Drop

Verse Two I'm Breakin' Loose
I Got Two Little Dollies And I'm Fuckin' With Voodoo
I Push A Pin Right Through The Center Of Her Throat
And Ever Since That Moment She Can't Sing The Right Note
No Joke Fuckin' Hoe You Should Know
I'll Cut Your Pretty Neck Because I Love The Sound Of The Blood Flow
I Know It May Sound A Bit Absurd
But Pleasant To Me Beause I Know You're Getting What You Deserve
I Got The Other Dolly And Sewed Her Mouth Shut
For Being A Fuckin' Disgrace For Being A Fuckin' Disgust
Kill Yourself Slut Please In The Next Few Days
After All It's Better To Burn Than To Fade Away
(Chorus 2: Razakel)
Just Another Bxtch From Around The Way
And I've Been Silent For Years; Now I Got Somethin' To Say
I'm That Serial Killin' Bxtch Wicked And Proud
And To All You Fake Bxtches I Suggest You Bow Down
To The Sound Of The Underground Ringing In Your Brain
I Got Wicked Desires And Known To Bring The Fuckin' Pain
It Would Be My Honor To Be-Head Bxtches Non-Stop
Chop Chop Cause There's Only Room For One; Razakel Claims The Spot
(Verse 3: Razakel
Stop, Listen Bxtch
Unlike You I Can Back Up My Lyrics
I Hope That You Fear It
I Take Your Blood And I Smear It
On My Naked Body As I'm Summoning The Dark Spirits
So Go Ahead Bxtch Keep Talking Your Shit
Every Time You Say My Name You're Making Me More Famous
But I Love It So I'd Like To Thank You
So Here's A Little Gift From Razakel To You...
Blood Turn Black, And Flesh Turn Blue
Evil From Me And Back To You
Blood Go Black And Flesh Go Blue
By The Left Hand I Now Curse You
(Chorus 2: Razakel)
Just Another Bxtch From Around The Way
And I've Been Silent For Years; Now I Got Somethin' To Say
I'm That Serial Killin' Bxtch Wicked And Proud
And To All The Fake Bxtches I Suggest You Bow Down
To The Sound Of The Underground Ringing In Your Brain
I Got Wicked Desires And Known To Bring The Fuckin' Pain
It Would Be My Honor To Be-Head Bxtches Non-Stop
Chop Chop Cause There's Only Room For One; Razakel Claims The Spot
(Interlude)
Please Do Me A Favor, Kill Yourself
There's Nothing Left, So Just Kill Yourself
(Laughing)
Hahahaha
(Chorus 2: Razakel)
Just Another Bxtch From Around The Way
And I've Been Silent For Years; Now I Got Somethin' To Say
I'm That Serial Killin' Bxtch Wicked And Proud
And To All The Fake Bxtches I Suggest You Bow Down
To The Sound Of The Underground Ringing In Your Brain
I Got Wicked Desires And Known To Bring The Fuckin' Pain
It Would Be My Honor To Be-Head Bxtches Non-Stop
