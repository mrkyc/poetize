I can't escape it, inside my head it keeps repeating
Isolated feelings its like my heart is bleeding
I can't escape it, inside my head it keeps repeating
Everytime I seem to close my eyes
I feel so dead inside so I cry myself to sleep
All I ever do is think of the pain
Feels like I'm goin insane, so I cry myself to sleep
I don't wanna be talked to, I don't wanna be touched
I don't need your advice, I don't wanna be fucked
People think I have it all but I don't have much
I just wanna fly away but to the ground I'm stuck
I'd just rather walk away but you don't seem to understand
Why should I voice my opinion when you have the upper hand?
Its kinda sad I'm right back in the same position
I got so many eager ears but still nobody ever listens
And my friends? Yeah man I ain't got much of that
Just people dyin to be in the presence of that bitch Raz
And thats fine cause in reality I'm ugly inside
If you really knew the truth
I'd bet you'd quit wasting your time, and your money
I'm like a seed planted deep nurished by hate
I've evolved into this monster with a face of disgrace
Everyday is just the same, is soemthing missing inside?
Certain scenes keep haunting me, and keep me cryin at night
Why were others more important, why did I come last?
I'm so tattered and torn its like a blast from the past
I know I ain't the one to judge but I can't help it sometimes
When I step outside the box I notice forespread lies
So I cry myself to sleep, someone listen please
I'm so bitter inside. Its almost hard to breathe
Like I'm asmatic when I talk you hear static
You can't grasp or understand it
Once again I've given into madness
Isolated feelings, its like my heart is bleeding
I can't escape it, inside my head it keeps repeating
Isolated feeligns, its like my heart is bleeding
I can't escpae it, inside my head it keeps repeating
Everytime I seem to close my eyes
I feel so dead inside so i cry myself to sleep
All i ever do is think of the pain
