Now That I Awake Into Another Day
My Obsessive Mind State Is Driving Me Crazy
It's Really Hard To Say Difficult To Explain
But The Way He Makes Me Feel Puts My Heart In Such Pain
He Never Looks My Way I Probably Don't Even Exist
But I Just Keep Fantasizing About His Dick Between My Hips
I Wanna Cut His Skin, Take His Blood, Rub It On My Body
I'm Losing It, It's Like He Is My Prey And I am Stalking
I'm So Sorry But I Must Confess
When I Undress I Caress Myself
Imagine That It's Him Instead
I Pretend He Loves To Talk To Me
Call Him Up Everyday And Don't Say A Word
(Phone Rings. Man's Voice-Hello? Hello? Who Is This? Leave Me The Fuck Alone)
Just So I Can Hear Him Speak
Nightly I Sneak Through His Bedroom Window
Watch Him Sleep Peacefully
With My Mask I'm Creeping Very Slow
I Tied His Hands To The Bedpost So He Couldn't Go
Now He's Mine Forever, Now This Is My Home
(Chorus)
Ready Or Not
Here I Come
You Can't Hide
I'm Gonna Find You
And Rape You Slowly
Ready Or Not
Here I Come
You Can't Hide
I'm Gonna Find You
And Make You Want Me

Now That I Awake Into Another Day
My Obsessive Mind State Once Again Drives Me Crazy
Un-healthy Her Innocence Fascinates Me
I'm Day Dreamin' Getting Lost Somebody Save Me
I Imagine Dirty Things I Wanna Do To Her
Come Here Little Girl I Wanna Make Your Kitty Purr
Her Beauty Hurts Me It's The Sweetest Suffering
Comforting, For A Night With Her I'd Give Up Everything
She Don't Even Know How Deep I Really Feel For Her
That's Why I'm Secretly Following And Stalking Her
I Like To Watch Her Play At Parks Cause It Intrigues Me So
Approach Her With Some Candy Let Her Know She's Beautiful
Come With Me, Don't Worry, Take A Chance With Me
I'll Give You Candy If You Let Me Touch Me Where You Pee
Keep This As Our Secret Noone Ever Has To Know
That I Wanna Rape You Slowly Before You Start To Grow
I Wanna Lock You In A Bathroom Tie You Up
Choke You, Make You Gag, Show You What The Fuck Is Up
Your Purity Is What I Love, I'm Addicted To You
Now Your Mine Forever, Make My Darkest Dreams Come True
(Chorus)
Ready Or Not
Here I Come
You Can't Hide
I'm Gonna Find You
And Rape You Slowly
Ready Or Not
Here I Come
You Can't Hide
I'm Gonna Find You
And Make You Want Me
(Outro)
You Can't Run Away From A Bxth Like Me
No Baby, I'm Crazy, You Don't Wanna Tess Me, No
And Anywhere You Go I'm Going To Always Know
No Baby, I'm Crazy, You Don't Wanna Tess Me, No
(Chorus)
Ready Or Not
Here I Come
You Can't Hide
I'm Gonna Find You
And Rape You Slowly
Ready Or Not
Here I Come
You Can't Hide
I'm Gonna Find You
And Make You Want Me
Want Me, Want Me, Want Me, Want Me
