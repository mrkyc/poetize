No tears please, it's waste of good suffering

It's a very, it's a very violent midnight
Very scary, very scary violent midnight
Victims, aren't we all? We all?

Tick tock goes the clock
As the sun sets darkness falls
Be prepared to die
Death is coming
This is no surprise
Can't hide
It's a very scary violent midnight
Victims, aren't we all? We all?
It's about that time for to hide my face and mask it up
Identity can't be revealed, must remain anonymous
I'm a full bred murderer, these others are just simple mutts
I'm stuck in bitch mode 24/7 'cause I give no fucks
Give no fucks, I don't give a fuck what they all say about me
I just keep my mouth shut 'cause soon enough all of them will see
I ain't big on talking cheap, I'm more about the action, please
Real killas move in silence, that's the street code, can't you see?
I wanna make you bleed, make you suffer in front of me
Got a hit list full of guests 'cause misery loves company
I'm creeping through your blocks and watching you as you sleep
You don't wanna admit it but in the back of your head
You know it's me, you know it's me

If you think you're my enemy, well, please don't flatter yourself
You're just an object to me, another trophy to add on my shelf
How funny that you can't even play all them cards
That you been dealt
Hope you got them cops up on speed dial
You're gonna need their help
I'm gonna invade your home, kidnap ya, bundy style
Drag ya down the hallway by your hair
And smash your face on the kitchen tile
Put ya in the trunk of my car, bump SKR as I smile
Nobody's gonna find you
Unless they search the desert mile per mile
These haters love me - secret admirers
They remain below me and I just keep climbing higher
Higher and higher and higher - vertigo
I step it up, move faster while they're stuck in slow motion
It's a very, it's a very violent midnight
Very scary, very scary violent midnight
Victims, aren't we all? We all?
