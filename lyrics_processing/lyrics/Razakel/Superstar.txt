I don't know who they are
I see 'em hatin' hard
They think they're doing good
But I can do it better
They think they're superstars
But they ain't up to par
They think they're doing good
But I can do it better
Better, better
I can do it better
Better, better
Oh, I can do it better
I don't know who you are
You ain't no superstar
You think you're doing good
But I can do it better

See me
Watch out, guaranteed I'm the  at your feet
Hear me
The voice makes you trembling under the sheets
Touch me
Feel the ground move, but don't fall don't slip
Taste me
I got poison lips I know you wanna kiss
You might also likeNot think I'm real?
You know the deal
Spittin' it raw, I don't care how you feel
No deadly weakness, no Achilles heel
Opinions ain't shit, they ain't paying my bills
 so ill, you need a refill
I rely on talent and not sex appeal
You livin' that fantasy, oh so surreal
I kill it for  like abortion pills (Oh)
I'm-I'm-I'm more dope than the trees that your weak man's dealing (Oh)
You-you-you don't want to fuck with me
You're with Whitney
Big-headed rappers  a hug
You want life-support, I'm pulling the plug
I ain't from Boston, but I'll strangle ya
Murder, I wrote it, like Angela
Let's go

I don't know who they are
I see 'em hatin' hard
They think they're doing good
But I can do it better
They think they're superstars
But they ain't up to par
They think they're doing good
But I can do it better
Better, better
I can do it better
Better, better
Oh, I can do it better
I don't know who you are
You ain't no superstar
You think you're doing good
But I can do it better
Dub-P
You don't really know when the psychos coming with the tight flow
Running my mouth, I'm crazy
Neckhairs raising, every time I come into the room I see 'em shaking
I'm a mental patient
Head so vacant
Blank-ass stare, when I look you in the face giving you
Sensations
Goosebumps all upon your arms and legs
I leave you harmed for days, you can ask my agent
I don't know why
Everybody's hatin' on me, maybe 'cause I'm rippin' on a different level
When I robot
Everybody's looking at me, talkin' 'bout me like "Yo, who's that rebel?"
Bitch, it's settled
All I wanna do is kill instrumentals
My therapist just thinks I'm special
Yup, I was built just a little off tilt
Don't know what to tell ya
I'm just a weirdo, ain't I?
You loathe me and won't say why
Got no reason I'm a heathen
Even breathin' in the mic like Michael, I don't play nice
They like, "Who is that?"
I don't fit in anywhere so I'm through with that
You know, I'm a little better with the 
So if I see 'em gettin' on me, I'mma move 'em back
I don't know who they are
I see 'em hatin' hard
They think they're doing good
But I can do it better
They think they're superstars
But they ain't up to par
They think they're doing good
But I can do it better
Better, better
I can do it better
Better, better
Oh, I can do it better
I don't know who you are
You ain't no superstar
You think you're doing good
But I can do it better

I'm hustlin' every day like Rick Ross
These hoes are my prostitutes, I'm a pimp boss
Yeah, I'm passin' 'em up,  lock
They can't keep it up like a soft cock (Oh)
Y'all shocked?
Got a lotta bars and they all hot
Got a lotta homies and they all on
Yeah, I'm hittin' with the flow and they all "What"
This is a warning, your wake up call
My  gun shooting up your mall
You can have a little piece, I'm gonna take it all
I rather walk and stumble, than run and fall
Yup, me I rise I'm done with y'all
Don't you see me on the roll doin' somersaults?
When my tongue's involved that it's like a lethal weapon
That I'm bringing everywhere just to punish y'all

And even though they're all out to get me
One, two, three hide and seek
Can't find me
You'll see, it's true
I can do it better than you

I don't know who they are
I see 'em hatin' hard
They think they're doing good (I can do it better than you)
But I can do it better
They think they're superstars
But they ain't up to par
They think they're doing good
But I can do it better (I can do it better than you)
Better, better
I can do it better
Better, better (I can do it better than you)
Oh, I can do it better
I don't know who you are
You ain't no superstar
You think you're doing good
But I can do it better (I can do it better than you)
I don't know who they are
I see 'em hatin' hard
They think they're doing good (I can do it better than you)
But I can do it better
They think they're superstars
But they ain't up to par
They think they're doing good
But I can do it better (I can do it better than you)
Better, better
I can do it better
Oh, I can do it better (I can do it better than you)
I can do it better
