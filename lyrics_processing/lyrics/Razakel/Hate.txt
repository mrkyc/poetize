Everyone could die today and I still wouldn't care
Be aware, be aware, because i'm coming to get ya
Gonna strap ya to my bed and then dissect ya
The pain is pleasure, I love the suffering
Stickin pins and needles underneath your nails just to hear you scream
Hang you from the ceiling by one leg upside down
Put cigarettes out in your armpit so you're pissing in your own mouth
I've got control now
I'll take a bow as my audience applause the sound
Of your screams and cries, humanity is what i despise
I'm breaking some glass, pushing them deep in both of your eyes
Because I feel nothing but hate
If you wanna take a taste I will seal your fate
No time to be wasting, you might pray, I'm chasin
You'll mistake and face it, your death is awaitin
I have hate crawling through my system
Fuck around, become my very next victim
You're gonna die, you'll never see another day
This is hate motherfucka hate, motherfucka hate
I have hate crawling through my system
Fuck around, become my very next victim
You're gonna die, you'll never see another day
This is hate motherfucka hate, motherfucka hate
You might also likeI hate you, I hate me, too
I hate you fucking Christians who are blind to the truth
No gods gonna save you, fuck all religion
At least I got the balls to admit when I'm sinnin
Don't need your permission, makin incisions
I'm grinnin, you're living a life full of fiction
Crucifix is turned upside down when I'm killin
God hates me too, why I ain't made in his image
Grisly percision, I slit necks of Christians
Not all the way, just enough so bloods dripping
Sipping it up, I think I'm getting kinda wet
So I cut off your tongue and rub my clitoris with it
I'm a sick bitch, I'll make you twitch, throw your body in a ditch
Or you can get burned at the stake like a salem witch
I can't resist but i'm the new gathering
With the suffering, living a life full of misempathy
I have hate crawling through my system
Fuck around, become my very next victim
You're gonna die, you'll never see another day
This is hate motherfucka hate, motherfucka hate
I have hate crawling through my system
Fuck around, become my very next victim
You're gonna die, you'll never see another day
This is hate motherfucka hate, motherfucka hate
Life is so shitty, but ain't it fucking great?
You can't stop me from breaking your face
It's you I'll erase, your flesh I'll lacerate
Andrenaline is pumpin, I'm filled with such hate
Don't berape me, you cannot escape me
Hang you from a tree, penises are sold for some candy
Keep on beatin till you're pissin and shittin that blood
Then strip you naked and sodomize you with a cactus
Then wrapped up in plastic, you can't run
You're captured by this fatal attraction
No distractions when the plans in action
Delayed reactions, you'll be wondering what happened
I'm laughing as I superglue your nose and lips shut
Torturing you slow, become a victim of suffocation
Mutilation, anal penetration, death is my creation
I have hate crawling through my system
Fuck around, become my very next victim
You're gonna die, you'll never see another day
This is hate motherfucka hate, hate motherfucka hate
I have hate crawling through my system
Fuck around, become my very next victim
You're gonna die, you'll never see another day
This is hate motherfucka hate, hate motherfucka hate
This is hate motherfucka hate, motherfucka hate
