I'll keep quiet, you won't even know I'm here
You won't suspect a thing, you won't see me in the mirror
I crept into your heart, you can't make me disappear
Till I make you
I made myself at home in the cobwebs and the lies
I'm learning all your tricks, I can hurt you from inside
I made myself a promise, you would never see me cry
Till I make you

You'll never know what hit you
Won't see me closing in
I'm gonna make you suffer
This Hell you put me in, I'm underneath your skin
The devil within
You'll never know what hit you

Like a cancer, I'll kill you from within
Exorcisms can't help you - I'm the Devil, I win
You never saw me coming, surprise! I broke in
Burglarized, committing crimes and unforgivable sins
And now you know just how it goes
You tried to fight the feeling, try to hide it but it shows
And you can never let me go, this is the path that you chose
Deep down you know I'm gonna break you
I'll be here when you think you're all alone
Seeping through the cracks, I'm the poison in your bones
My love is your disease, I won't let it set you free
Till I break you
You might also like
You'll never know what hit you
Won't see me closing in
I'm gonna make you suffer
This Hell you put me in, I'm underneath your skin
The devil within

I tried to be the lover to your nightmare
Look what you made of me
Now I'm the heavy burden that you can't bare
Look what you made of me
Look what you made of me
I'll make you see

You'll never know what hit you
Won't see me closing in
I'm gonna make you suffer
This Hell you put me in, I'm underneath your skin
The devil within
