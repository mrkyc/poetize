Everybody Wants To Underestimate Women
All You Fools Are The Type I Wanna Slit Right Open
Expose Your Insides Obliterate Your Life
I'm The Wickedest Bxtch Alive
Yes The Title Is Mine
Femicide Is Defined As Female Genocide
But In My Eyes it's Defined As A Sign To Rise
Run And Hide Beg And Pray
You Ain't Gonna Be Saved
You'll Become My Slave
Naked, Gagged Up, Attached To Chains
Eviscerate, Terminate, Eliminate, Annihilate
Committin' These Acts Of Torture
Committin' These Acts Of Pain
No Pain No Game
My Poetry Is Insane
JP Provides A Beat And I Go Psycho In The Brain
Underground Is My Domain
I Work Hard To Make A Name
Three Years Deep And I'm Still Puttin' Divas To Shame
You Can't Take Away My Spot
I'm Something you Are Not
Try All You Want You're Stuck In My Shadows It Or Not
(Chorus)
Look At How They All Want To Be Me
Look At How They All Try To Be Me
I Took My Spot, It Wasn't Given To Me
It's The Rise Of The Bxtch
And That Bxtch Is Me, Yeah
Look At How They All Want To Be Me
Look At How They All Try To Be Me
I Took My Spot, It Wasn't Given To Me
It's The Rise Of The Bxtch
And That Bxtch Is Me, Yeah
(Verse 2)
Now It's Time For Me To Set Myself Apart
From These Hoes With No Heart
And With No Smarts
Cause This Underground Shits In My Veins
Wicked Shit All Fuckin Day
I'm Talkin Deeper Than The Hatchet
Ain't No Room For God Up In This place
I'm Killin God's People
I'm So Kryptik From The Sick Side
I'm Gonna Take You On A Hell Ride
If You Don't Know Your Underground History
What Makes You Think You Can Spit Or Be A Wicked MC
It's Sad To Me Rappers Emerge
They All Know Nothing
Don't Pay Respects To The Best That Made This Scene Into Something
So Fuck Watered Down Wicked Shit
I'd Rather Shit In My Own Pussy Than Give Them Another Listen
I'm A Fan Before An Artist
Wicked And So Heartless
I've Been Down With This Shit Even Before The Rapping Started
Goes To Show Bxtches Are Uneducated
Just A Bunch Of Pretty Faces
Hated And Overrated, Oh
You might also like(Chorus)
Look At How They All Want To Be Me
Look At How They All Try To Be Me
I Took My Spot, It Wasn't Given To Me
It's The Rise Of The Bxtch
And That Bxtch Is Me, Yeah
Look At How They All Want To Be Me
Look At How They All Try To Be Me
I Took My Spot, It Wasn't Given To Me
It's The Rise Of The Bxtch
And That Bxtch Is Me, Yeah
(Outro)
Wanna Be Me
Try To Be Me
