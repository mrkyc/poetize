You can't put me together, can't make the pieces fit
I'm a broken mirror, take a look inside me

You think you got me figured out but you ain't even close
Just because you bump my music doesn't mean you really know
In fact, you don't know about this road that I chose
It wasn't easy all alone but somehow I still achieved my goal
I'm very grateful for these treasures that I have
A home, people that love me, these are things I've never had
I've always felt I was a burden right from the start
That's how I learned I could always be safe if I let nobody inside my heart
And some people say they got my back, but all these backstabbing bitches only make me laugh
It's like they gotta have my trust, gotta confide in them
But I don't even trust myself, let alone another human
The only people that I feel that truly got my back
Is my brother and my man, and of course the whole camp
My fans across the map, I love y'all and that's straight from the heart
Bump my music when you're lonely and know we'll never ever be apart

You can't put me together, can't make the pieces fit
I'm a broken mirror, take a look inside me

Ohh, I hope you see me
Ohh, I hope you hear me
You might also like
I remember it like it was yesterday
The day you went to sleep and your life faded away
My skies turned grey, and now nothing is the same
You're on the other side but there's so much I wanna say
Like "I'm so sorry, will you ever forgive me?"
"If you could see me now would you be proud of me?"
Those bad days we had, I wish I could take 'em all back
Rewind, start over, now that I'm older - the hate's in the past
I know I've always been rapping about death
But when it happens in your family, you see a different aspect
Don't neglect what you got, cherish it dearly
Or else you'll end up just like me, guilty with wishful thinking
 (x4)
You can't put me together, can't make the pieces fit
I'm a broken mirror, take a look inside me

Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, I hope you see me
