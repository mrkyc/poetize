Little boy, little boy, you know you ain't got nothing for me
I need somebody like the ones in horror movies
You'll never amount to anything that I really need
I need a killer, a man that makes me bleed
Little boy, little boy, you know you ain't got nothing for me
I need somebody like the ones in horror movies
You'll never amount to anything that I really need
I need a killer, these are the men of my dreams

I need somebody like Mr. Freddy Kreuger
Somebody who kills kids, especially preschoolers
I rape him with rulers as he fingers me deeply
My pussy is bleeding, this is my fantasy on Elm Street
Or somebody like Jason Vorhees
He'll hack you up with a machete as you scream "Please!"
I lick the plate clean, I know he was meant for me
We go on killing sprees each Friday the 13th
I need somebody like Michael Myers
Blank face, no emotion, he controls my dark desires
He's hot like fire but his blood runs cold
Every Halloween he stalks me and it never gets old
Or maybe somebody like Pinhead from Hellraiser
The prince of Hell mutilates my flesh with rusty razors
He eats my pussy right as the pins stick into my thighs
I see the devil in his eyes, that's how I know he's mine

I need somebody like the great Ted Bundy
A lady killer with class, and at night we go hunting
Pull girls into his buggy then drag 'em in the shed
Bash 'em on the head, bend 'em over, fuck 'em while they're dead
Or somebody like the legendary Ed Geins
Skin dead bodies for decorations at our wedding
I wear human flesh as my wedding dress
He's the best, I bet even mama Gein would be impressed
I need somebody like Jeffrey Dahmer
We kill faggots together 'cause every faggot is a mugger
I be his partner and we create zombie sex slaves
Cannibalism and necrophilia is what we crave
But I already got somebody, I don't need another
I got that murder junkie, Satanic motherfucker
He makes these others look like little boys only trying
If you ain't Satanic or soulless, you ain't worth my time
