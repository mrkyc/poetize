The center of your darkness, darin' ya scarin' ya
Causin' mass Hysteria
Bite ya deep like A Pitbull Terrier
Deadly like Malaria
Most evil level 23 breaking all barriers
You bitches trip i'll carry ya
Out to the Cemetery and then Bury ya
Your Heart beats Racin' back and forth your Pacin'
I'm just like Jason you run i'm chasin'
Erasin' your existence
I'll catch ya and find ya no matter the distance
Persistence to kill, no lie, no lie
Sing along now to my scary lullaby
Cross my heart, hope you die
I'm 'bout to take your life
Don't laugh when you see a Hearse go by, by
Cause you might be the next one to die, die
Fear fills your mind tears fill your eyes, eyes
Nowhere to run or hide
You will be mine
It's impossible whatcha gonna do now?
You can't slow me down, slow me down
It's impossible you can't take me out
You can't slow me down, slow me down ,no

Until i'm caught or i'm dead ( i'm dead, i'm dead )
I got a blood fetish
I wanna see you bleed Cherry Red ( Red, Red )
Your Nightmare your worst Dream
The girl of your screams
Nothing is what it seems
Come to me, Come to me
Don't laugh when you see a Hearse go by, by
Cause you might be the next one to die, die
Fear fills your mind tears fill your eyes, eyes
Nowhere to run or hide
You will be mine
