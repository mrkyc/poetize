I'm the nightmare next door
Don't you dare take a peek
Terror unmatched, horror unleashed vividly
Creepy-crawl time, this is my secret to keep
Hide and seek
You will see how evil runs deep
Ocean deep

It's time
Homicidal activity

I'm back, sodomizing your ears once again
No lube, no protection
Balls deep, I'm tearin', I'm stretchin'
I leave 'em all stressin'
They can't eliminate me
Molesting the mic, molesting the beat
No wonder so many bitches hate on me
Takin' over everything, you can't escape me
Berate me, negate me
Ain't no motherfucker out there that can replicate me
It's like Charlie , here I am
Bloodthirsty, controlling you
Too sick for a bitch, I spit like a man
Understand, you can't brand or classify me
The hooks and chains have been cut
No longer confine  free
Fuck a label, fuck it fans, fuck the scene
Horrorcore is my husband, I'm his widow
Rest in peace
I'm the nightmare next door
Don't you dare take a peek
Terror unmatched, horror unleashed vividly

You're terrified like a lamb in a slaughterhouse
It never gets old seeing you die, it gets me aroused
I want to be the witness while you're dying and bleeding
I like to be the one that keeps you fearing
Oh, no you're offended
I crossed the line again
Go on and keep pretendin'
'Cause you will meet your end

I'm remorseless, my conscience is dead
I'm like Josh Phillips keeping your dead body under my bed
I'm the nightmare next door
Don't you dare take a peek
Terror unmatched, horror unleashed vividly
Creepy-crawl time, this is my secret to keep

You will see how evil runs deep

I'm a lethal injection of terror
You're about to overdose
Better look up to the Father, the Son
And The Holy Ghost
I ain't like most spitting soft or
Forever keep it brutal
You don't like me, I don't like you
I ain't begging for approval
I'm not giving a fuck
Like Jeffrey Dahmer I'm cutting you up
Keep your head in my freezer, your body I'll destruct
Homicidal activity
Killing women so brutally
Add 'em to my list of casualties
I'm the female version of Ted Bundy
I'm the mistress of Death, the mistress of murder
Collecting dead men like Gacy, your body hoarder
Obsessive-compulsive disorder
I'll strive for perfection
Taste my rejection

I'm the nightmare next door
Don't you dare take a peek
Terror unmatched, horror unleashed vividly
Creepy-crawl time, this is my secret to keep
Hide and seek
You will see how evil runs deep
Ocean deep

Like a sick dog waiting to be put out of misery
Horrorcore is my husband, I'm his widow
Rest in peace
