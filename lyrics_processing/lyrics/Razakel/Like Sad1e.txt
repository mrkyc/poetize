From The Darkness I Emerge Once Again
Hell Sent From The Devil Here To Spit Wicked Shit
I Cast Hexes And Curses; Lay Spells In My Verses
Blaspheme The Lords Name When I'm Burning Christian Churches Down
Can You Hear That Wicked Sound?
There's These Voices In My Head And They Make Me Wanna Cut Throats Out
So I Carry A Knife By My Side
Cause I Was Always Taught That Murdering Is A Part Of Life
No Lie, I, Like To Make Bitches Cry And Scream
I'm The Real Murder Scene Queen
Listen Up Don't Ya Disrespect The Mistress Of Death
Is Quick To Shove A Shank Into Your Neck
And Carve An "R" In The Center Of Your Chest
And Watch The Blood Drip Drip (Drip) Drip (Drip) Drip (Drip)
Listen To Me, I'm A Deadly Disease
You'll Never Get Rid Of Me
I'll Even Haunt You In Your Dreams
(Chorus)
How Bout You Shut The Fuck Up
And Let A Real Bitch Spit This
Cause All You Other Hoes Are Too Afraid To Get Wicked
I'm Here To Spread The Sickness
Best Believe This
I'll Stab You And Your Crew And Every Other Fucking Witness
No Competition, I'm A Sick Bitch
The Devil's In My Head And He's Telling' Me To Do It
So Goodbye, You Must Die
I'm Like Sad1e In This Bitch Stabbing Tate In 1969

I'm Gonna Keep Stabbing The More You Keep Screaming
I'm Gonna Keep Laughing The More You Keep Bleeding
I Can Guarantee Your Gonna Die Tonight
Don't Give A Fuck If You're Pregnant
I'ma Destroyer Of Life
And I'm Just A Reflection Of You
Except I Do All The Things You Only Wish You Could Do
It's True
The More You Kill
The More You Like it
So I'ma Murder Without Reason And I Won't Deny It
You Should Try It
Kill 'Em All Kill 'Em All
And Write Political Piggy With Some Blood On The Wall
Leave Something Witchy For Them All To See
Only Through Death Will They See What You Truly Believe
Grab A Knife Take A Life Don't Think Twice
Stick It Deep Inside Look Into Their Eyes
Goodbye
So Now You're Done
Wasn't That Fun
To Know You're The One Who Killed A Mother And Her Unborn Son
(Chorus)
How Bout You Shut The Fuck Up
And Let A Real Bitch Spit This
Cause All You Other Hoes Are Too Afraid To Get Wicked
I'm Here To Spread The Sickness
Best Believe This
I'll Stab You And Your Crew And Every Other Fucking Witness
No Competition, I'm A Sick Bitch
The Devil's In My Head And He's Telling' Me To Do It
So Goodbye, You Must Die
I'm Like Sad1e In This Bitch Stabbing Tate In 1969
(Verse 3)
Sixteen Times All Over The Body
Rolled Around In The Splash
And Got Myself All Bloody
Nobody Understands Me I Get Off When I Inflict The Pain
What I Call Psychotic Brilliance You Call Criminally Insane
I Came To Show You How It's Done
Straight From The Devil's Kingdom If You Wanna Come Get Some
Straight Up Not Giving' A Fuck
The Wicked Bitch Of The Southwest Is Tearing' Shit Up
Cause There Ain't No Other Bitch Out There Quite Like Me
They Can Attempt All They Want
But The Wickedness Belongs To Me
I Got No Mercy it's Kinda Like Fucking
My Knife's Hard Dick; Your Body's A Wet Pussy
Cum For Me Baby Cause I Love To See You Bleed
It Feeds My Need When I See You Suffering
Believe Me When I Say I'll Cause Devastation
And Every Other Bitch Is A Cheap Imitation
(Chorus)
How Bout You Shut The Fuck Up
And Let A Real Bitch Spit This
Cause All You Other Hoes Are Too Afraid To Get Wicked
I'm Here To Spread The Sickness
Best Believe This
I'll Stab You And Your Crew And Every Other Fucking Witness
No Competition, I'm A Sick Bitch
The Devil's In My Head And He's Telling' Me To Do It
So Goodbye, You Must Die
I'm Like Sad1e In This Bitch Stabbing Tate In 1969
