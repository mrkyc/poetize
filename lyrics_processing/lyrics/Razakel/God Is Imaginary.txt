If I wash my hands in others blood, Am I sick?
If I drench myself in others blood, Am I sick?
If I bathe myself in others blood, Am I sick?
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Living for a lie
Brain washed, So lost, What's the point in trying
What's the point in fighting
You'll never end this in me
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
Killin every???
God is Imaginary
Babble Babble, Bitch Bitch
And break the fuckin crucifix
Take a sip of this potion that be so murderis
These verses ain't for the religous and the weak at heart
I represent the wicked and I'm creeping out from the dark
I gotta story to tell, So kiddies listen up well
I've been through hell, And I think I know it very well
This isn't no fairy tell, I never had it easy
Constantly harassed, And brain washed into believeing
Stealing money for drugs, Name it I've tried it
Slit my wrist for the rush is this to much to digest
While you were preaching to the needy each and every evening
I was busy bleeding and recieveing unholy seamen
I'm that heathin always bathin in christian blood
I'm that heathin blaspheming the lord above
And I will make you understand what it's like to be me
Count your sanity away, Put your faith in misery
You might also likeNo life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Living for a lie
Brain washed, So lost, What's the point in trying
What's the point in fighting
You'll never end this in me
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin

God is Imaginary
Blood is all over my hands and body
I smell human flesh decaying and rotting
Burnt pages of the bible surround me
I pick one of the pages up, Proverbs 8: 17
I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me
Hard to believe cause I was seeking and you never loved me
Could it be, Are you imaginary?
That would explain everything
But the blinded still never see
Are you proud of me, Mommy and Daddy?
How's it feel to to know that god can't stand me
I live to blasphem, You'll never understand me
And neither do the 5 hired sheriks that examined me
She's fuckin crazy and obsessed with death
Look at all of her piercings and that the way she's dressed
You fuckin derserve a knife in your neck
For passin such judgement, I can only wish you death
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Living for a lie
Brain washed, So lost, What's the point in trying
What's the point in fighting
You'll never end this in me
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
Killin every???
God is Imaginary
Woke up one mourning
Outside the rain was pouring
I went to a church and stabbed the pastours heart without a warning
He screamed child why would you go and take my life
Stuck my knife deep inside as I saw my fate through his eyes
I dug my hands through his blood and wiped it on my face
Looked up to the sky, Ain't I such a beautiful disgrace
Blood stained with no way to be saved
God doesn't exist, I'd rather have faith in pain
And since pain is all I know, I make the weak bleed slow
Mom and Dad said I was nothin, So it's time for me to show
What I'm capable of, Without their bullshit life
I'm standing up, Headstrong, In control of my life
Now look into my eyes tell me do you see love
Of course not, I got no mercy for no one
So if I stick my hands in others blood am I sick?
Or am I just another sick bitch lunatic
No life, No mind, Nothing left inside
Living for a lie
Brain washed, So lost, What's the point in trying
What's the point in fighting
You'll never end this in me
No voice, No choice, No true realality
Mentally controlled, Never to be set free
Not me, I'm addicted to sinnin
Killin every???
