Look Away From Me You Don't Want To See
And So You Try To Forget Your Own Insanity
But Now I Watch You Bleed, And Now I Watch You Die
But For The Pain That You Feel, Not A Tear I Will Cry
Look Away From Me You Don't Want To See
And So You Try To Forget Your Own Insanity
But Now I Watch You Bleed, And Now I Watch You Die
But For The Pain That You Feel, Not A Tear I Will Cry

When I Was Sixteen, I Remember That Time
When We Fell So Deep In Love And Dedicated Our Lives
To Each Other Cause We Both Really Had Nobody Else
We Had Some Crazy Fucked Up Lives, But Some How We Always Dealt
We Take X-ACTO Blades And Slice Our Tongues Into Threes
Sixty-Nine Each Other Under Trees In The Local Cemetery
But Mommy, She Fuckin' Hated Him So Much
So He'd Sneak In Through My Window Every Night So We Could Fuck
And Take Two Tabs of Acid In The Name Of Charles Manson
Gave A Toast To GG Allin, Slammed Some Beam And Then Started Dancin
Underneath A Black Light With The Love Of My Life
And I Kept Telling Myself That Bxtch Is Gonna Die Tonight

You Don't See Me; You Don't Need Me; You Don't Hear Me
So How Can You Preach To me
I've Had Enough Now Baby (I've Had Enough Now Baby)
She's Coming In-Between Us Baby (She's Coming In-Between Us Baby)
But Just Maybe If We Fill Up A Syringe With Some Bleach
I'll Sneak Into Her Room, Inject It Into Her Arm As She Sleeps
Cause She's Misconceived; She Just Don't Want To Believe
She Thinks I'm Stuck In A Fantasy; But This Is My Whole Reality
So I Creep Through The Hallway And The Walls Begin To Cave In
I Approach The Doorway And I Hear Her Softly Breathe In
And Then She Exhales; Dreaming Sweet Fairy Tales
Push The Needle Through Her Vain; No Pain to Gain
You Can't Blame Or Tame A Dame This Insane
Covered Her Face; Screamed My Name
The Sky Turned Grey And It Begins To Rain
No Time To Delay So I Grabbed The Blade
Then Stabbed Her Stomach In The Devils Name
I Look Behind Me And There He Is With A Grin
I Undressed Him Then I Let Him Enter The Center Of My Dimension
Perfection Next To Mommy On The Bloody Bloody Bed
Now She's Dead, Covered In Red, No More Worries
Now Our Love Will Never Never End

You Always Stare But You Never Really Got To See
All The Hate I Learned It's Cause You Taught It To Me
No More Suffering
One Half Of The Battle Half Way Set Free
You Always Stare But You Never Really Got To See
All The Hate I Learned It's Cause You Taught It To Me
No More Suffering
One Half Of The Battle Half Way Set Free
