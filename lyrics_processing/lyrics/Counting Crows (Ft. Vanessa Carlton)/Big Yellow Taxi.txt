They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

Ooh, bop-bop-bop
Ooh, bop-bop-bop

They took all the trees, and put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them
No, no, no

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

Ooh, bop-bop-bop
Ooh, bop-bop-bop

And a big yellow taxi took my girl away
