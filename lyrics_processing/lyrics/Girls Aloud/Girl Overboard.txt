No doubt about it, no doubt about it
Tumbled, tumbled, oh
No doubt about it, no doubt about it
Tumbled, tumbled, oh

You know me, babe, I love the good livin'
Give me somethin' I can stick-stick in
You give the girl another hit, honey
You keep me waitin' and I'll keep runnin', now

Can't turn around, just to run out
Is there any light on the way home?
Somewhere along, I played it wrong
Fell into a world so far from home

Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I stumbled
And I thought I'd last forever, oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I tumbled
And I thought no doubt about it, oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I stumbled
And I thought I'd last forever, oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I tumbled
And I thought no doubt about it, oh

You know me, babe, I used to feel lucky
Until karma came a knock-knockin'
One little slip and I hit rock bottom
Life is waitin' but I'm not stoppin', now

Can't turn around, just to run out
Is there any light on the way home?
Somewhere along, I played it wrong
Fell into a world so far from home

Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I stumbled
And I thought I'd last forever, oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I tumbled
And I thought no doubt about it, oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I stumbled
And I thought I'd last forever, oh
Girl overboard
I thought I had it but I tumbled
And I thought no doubt about it, oh
No doubt about it, no doubt about it
Tumbled, tumbled, oh
No doubt about it, no doubt about it
Tumbled, tumbled, oh

Can't turn around, just to run out
