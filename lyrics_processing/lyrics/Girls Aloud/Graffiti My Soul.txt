Spike heels and skin tight jeans
I've got a fist full of love that's coming your way baby
Spike heels and skin tight jeans
I've got a fist full of love that's coming your way baby
Spike heels and skin tight jeans
I've got a fist full of love that's coming your way baby

I'm hanging on a wire
Spike heels and skin tight jeans
I've got a fist full of love that's coming your way baby
Come baby come you know what I mean
And the drum beat's rising higher
Bang goes my self control
I got your name on my face your face on my mind
Baby come baby come graffiti my soul

We should be getting it on
Fly DJs playing my song
Why don't you take me head on?
We should be getting somewhere
Some kind of cool love affair
Don't act as if you don't care
You dream of touching me there
See Girls Aloud LiveGet tickets as low as $23You might also like
Your kisses taste of Cyanide
And that's no good for me
An open heart is suicide
In my philosophy
I need a walking talking mannequin
That simply folds away
And never questions anything
I've got to say

N-n-n-n-n-n no more explanations
You're never gonna know
You could k-k-k-k kill my reputation
I don't do heavy loads
N-n-n-n-n-n no more conversations
You c-c-c-c-c can't carve up the world
It's a d-d-d-d-d dangerous occupation
Talking to a girl
I'm complicated
And I celebrate it
You're getting jaded
But you're fascinated

I'm complicated (Out the bedroom, down the stairs)
And I celebrate it (Along the carpet, no one cares)
You tell me you hate it (On the table, onto the floor)
But you're fascinated (It's procreation and nothing more)
D-d-d-d-d dance if you want 'til the dirty is done
'Cause we're stars in the dead of the night
But if you're looking for romance or a chance to reflect in the sun
Baby I'm gonna put up a fight
And you can d-d-d-d dance if you want 'til you fall out of space
And you crash in the back of the car
But if you wanna have the kids and the cash then get out of my face
Don't push my love too far

I'm hanging on a wire
Spike heels and skin tight jeans
I've got a fist full of love that's coming your way baby
Come baby come you know what I mean
And the drum beat's rising higher
Bang goes my self control
I got your name on my face your face on my mind
Baby come baby come graffiti my soul
Baby come baby come graffiti my soul
Baby come baby come graffiti my soul
Baby come baby come graffiti my soul
And the drum beat's rising higher
Bang goes my self control
I got your name on my face your face on my mind
