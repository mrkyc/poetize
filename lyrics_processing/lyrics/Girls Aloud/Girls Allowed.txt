Oh, woah-oh
Oh, ooh

I don't need a man doing everything he can
And giving up his life and everything he has to please me
(Oh, oh, oh)
I don't like the kinda guy who tells you that he loves you
For the sake in the heat of a one night stand
(Oh, oh, oh)

I never met a man as perfect as you (as you)
No one makes me feel the way that you do (you do)
I really, really mean it, when I say

If you want it, come and get it
(You know that I'll be waiting)
If you need it like I need it
(Don't go hesitating)
Won't regret it, don't forget it
(Baby, let me take you)
Oh, somewhere only this girl's allowed
