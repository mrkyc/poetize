I told ya last Monday
Your friends are cool
You're older, but one day
We're bendin' the rules

Last night I had a dream that you turned into money
I tried to save you, but I found I was not sorry
I think I feel I said, "Oh no, I want you honey"
But as I licked my lips, you turned and said, "No worries"

Pretty boys lack compassion with androgynous girls
And pretty soon shit'll happen, what a wonderful world
And your mum's getting younger to your daddy's delight
But he can't feed his hunger, what a beautiful life

I called ya to tell ya
You blow me away
I pulled ya, God help ya
We're only to blame

Last night I thought I died and found myself in heaven
I saw my spirit fly with angels dressed in leather
I think I heard them shout, "Oh no girl, what's the hurry?"
But as I floated down, I turned and said, "No worries"

Ready to rock, rock, rock the creation
Nature knock, knock, knocking away
Lose the mock, mock, mock imitations
God has got his rocks off today

I'll never give up
(I was lost) In the dark
(I was broke) In the heart, but no worries
I'll never give up
(I was locked) In the dark
(I was choked) In the heart, but no worries
