I was drowning in the rain
Getting lost beneath the downpour
Tried to shield a dying flame, ooh
Nearly lost what I had come for

But somewhere in my heart
A little gold was working its way out
And made a star
To guide me on my way
Somewhere deep inside
I remembered what it's all about
I took my time
But now I think I'll have my say, oh

Hear me out
I've done my running believe me
Without a doubt
I no longer take the blame
Hear me out
My heart is broken and bleeding
But it's beating
No other man I love is gonna leave me in the rain

I know (I was lost but now I'm found)
As the rain pours down the window (And I've turned my life around)
I'm no longer here in limbo
No more drama, smeared mascara on my pillow
When my life came tumbling down

Now I can see which way I'm going
Follow my heart that's what they say
Never too small can't stop me growing
Taking the world on day by day
Follow the way the wind is blowing
Free to explore and find my way
I'll take all the stuff that life is throwing
This is the chance to have my say, yeah

Hear me out
I've done my running believe me
Without a doubt
I'll no longer take the blame
Hear me out
My heart is broken and bleeding
But it's beating
No other man I love is gonna leave me in the rain
Hear me out
I've done my running believe me
Without a doubt
I'll no longer take the blame
Hear me out
My heart is broken and bleeding
But it's beating
No other man I love is gonna leave me in the rain

I know (I was lost but now I'm found)
As the rain pours down the window (And I've turned my life around)
I'm no longer here in limbo
