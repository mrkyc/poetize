I just wanna do it to you baby, watch me go
I wanna give you combinations, I could tell you but you already know, for sure
I wanna feel that funky fever, baby, I'm at the door
Got the keys, got the gasoline, pour it on, I'm ready to blow

At quarter past one, I was havin' fun
Tryna get it on, tryna make a move
Quarter past two, I was dressed in red
Tied up to your bed, begged you on my knees
Quarter past three, I was in the shower
Almost half an hour, you were at the door
Quarter past four, you were back again
Said your name was Ben, then we went for more

I just wanna do it to you baby, watch me go
I wanna give you combinations, I could tell you but you already know, for sure
I wanna feel that funky fever, baby, I'm at the door
Got the keys, got the gasoline, pour it on, I'm ready to blow
