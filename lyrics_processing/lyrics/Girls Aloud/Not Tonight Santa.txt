No Santa this morning
I guess my note got through
I told him quit calling
Cause all I want is you

Gotta get a minute
Gotta get you on your own
Your baby sister's sleeping
And your daddy's on the phone
I'm sure you're hiding something hot
You wanna give to me
And not another pair of socks from
Underneath the tree

Ooh ooh you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Ooh ooh I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours

No stocking this morning
But that don't make me blue
There's one thing I'm wanting
That I can only get from you

Gotta get a minute
Gotta get you on your own
Your baby sister's sleeping
And your daddy's on the phone
I'm sure you're hiding something hot
You wanna give to me
And not another pair of socks from
Underneath the tree

Ooh ooh you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Ooh ooh I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours, baby
Ooh ooh you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Ooh ooh I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours, baby

Now don't get crazy, Santa, baby
You know I'll always leave a little treat for you
It might sound stupid, but I need Cupid
More than all the presents that I think I'm due
Ooh ooh you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Ooh ooh I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours, baby
Ooh ooh you give me something I could never
Get from Santa Claus, baby
Ooh ooh I'll let you peep inside my stocking
