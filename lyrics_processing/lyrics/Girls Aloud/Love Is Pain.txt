What you are, what you see
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
What you know, what you need
It don't matter to me just be faithful to me

When you know, turning cold
When you know, turning cold (Turning cold, turning cold)

First I saw the letter, heard your secret code
Tellin' you walk away, what a waste, turning cold
First I saw the letter, heard your secret code
Tellin' you walk away, what a waste, turning cold
First I saw the letter, heard your secret code
Tellin' you walk away, what a waste, turning cold
First I saw the letter, heard your secret code
Tellin' you walk away, what a waste, turning cold

What you say, what you mean
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
What you want, what you dream
It don't matter to me just be faithful to me
