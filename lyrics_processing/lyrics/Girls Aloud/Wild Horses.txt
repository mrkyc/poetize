Poor boy Peter didn't know how
To claim his miracle, lost his way
Cost him dearly like his dad
He lost his pride to end this way

It's taken a long time (woo woo)
But wild horses wouldn't take me back to you (woo woo)
Get out of town and take your lazy dog with you
Your train is running late and overdue (Woo woo)

I was trying to sedate him, trying not to blow
Trying not to hate him but time was as blatant as gold
Wouldn't you know?
He was clean out of feelings, nothing to say
Rings on his fingers were as fake as the kisses he gave
I said have it your way

I'm just a crazy fool, took my time thought I'd be safe, oh
I said I felt the cold, ain't got love to choose oh oh baby
I shouldn't have lost my head, shouldn't have lost the meaning that I said, yeah yeah
I could have brought you home, get you back to what we both know, yeah yeah
