Ooh, I tried to talk to you
Ooh, it's like I can't get through
Ooh, have you blown me away?
Ooh, that's how you're making me feel
Hugs and kisses, wondering wishes
Bedtime pieces are on replay
Over and over again
Please help, tell me which path I need to take

I know you're hiding inside
And oh God, yes it is frustrating
But if you give me the time
I've got so much to share with you
I just can't get you out my mind

And now you've got me wondering what the hell I'm supposed to do
Other side of my world and I know that I'm in love with you
And if it's tugging inside, we both know I took you for a ride
And honey what have I done? Oh believe me I have realised

With you, only you, I know I can be myself
Funny how I could find love with you and nobody else
I could call you crying four in the morning and you'd make it better
Even when I thought I couldn't pull through and we'd be trying together

Let your body receive what I can give
And when we're ready, don't speak, it's happening
Let your body reveal an innocence
Let me set you free, it's magic
Let your body receive what I can give
And when we're ready, don't speak, it's happening
Let your body reveal an innocence
Let me set you free, it's magic

You're in my thoughts all the time
And I can't seem to shift you from my mind
I know I made a mistake
I need some help with shifting this heartache
You're in my thoughts all the time
You're in my thoughts all the time
You're in my thoughts all the time
