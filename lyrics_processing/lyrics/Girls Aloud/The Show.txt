If it's not you, oh, no, I won't do that
You'll have to wait for me and that is that

Shoulda known, shoulda cared
I shoulda hung around the kitchen in my underwear
Acting like a lady, you shoulda made me, oh
Shoulda jumped a little higher
Shoulda fluttered my mascara like a butterfly
Instead of being lazy, it would have saved me
Shoulda known, shoulda cared
I shoulda hung around the kitchen in my underwear
Acting like a lady, you shoulda made me, oh
Shoulda jumped a little higher
Shoulda fluttered my mascara like a butterfly
Instead of being lazy, it would have saved me

Someone saved my heart today
When someone turned the light back on
'Cause ever since you went away
The other rushes feel so wrong

That special something that they are hunting
They're always wanting more and more
That special something that they are hunting
They're always wanting more and more
