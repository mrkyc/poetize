Oh, there's something that I want to say to you
And jumpin' in your face just wouldn't do
'Cause summer in the sun don't pay
And sure, if crazy's what you feel then tell her so
There's something on your plate still getting cold
Well, ain't that just a crying shame?
It's hard having fun when you can't see the sun anymore
Wasting my time and I see when you're following me to the door
It's hard having fun when you can't see the sun anyway
Wasting my time and I see when you're following me all the way

There's black jacks running down my back and I say stop
'Cause I love you, baby
I fight hard and blue, with you
When I'm down and I say
Black jacks running down my back and I say stop
'Cause I love you, baby
I fight hard and blue, with you
'Cause you drive me crazy

New York nothing
Come and get stuck in
Won't you come rocking?
'Cause I gotta feel
When your beep-beep's get it
Crazy, don't sweat it
Honey, just forget it
If you keep it real
New York nothing
Come and get stuck in
Won't you come rocking?
'CauseI gotta feel
When your beep-beep's get it
Crazy, don't sweat it
Honey, just forget it
If you keep it real

Teacher, didn't you know?
I'm getting into the boat
These boots are making me slow
Ain't you going too fast?
The future's set in the past
You keep on telling me so
