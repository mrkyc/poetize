Been waiting all night

Revolution in the head don't count for nothing
You gotta, you gotta move that ass

You gotta, you gotta beat the past
Revolution in the head don't count for nothing, boy
You gotta move the mass
Revolution in the head don't count for nothing
You gotta, you gotta move that ass
