1, 2, 3, 4!
Everything he does, better than anything ordinary
Everything he wants he gets, cause everything he does is kinda necessary
Though I believe in love, tell me, can anything last forever?
If life can live up to love, then hand on my heart, I'm never saying never

Cause
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
The promise I made, the promise I made
Is starting to fade, starting to fade babe
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all that I cannot do
The promise I made, the promise I made
Is starting to fade, starting to fade

Maybe next time I'll take a ride on by
When I feel you near

Cause I can't play this like I'm meant to now
My Aladdin's lamp is down and I got a little fear
Ooh baby, right here

Giving up just looking into windows, yeah
I've had enough of wishing I found you
Baby don't you know
I've had as much as I can take of falling, yeah
I've got a lot to learn 'bout riding through

Cause
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
The promise I made, the promise I made
Is starting to fade, starting to fade babe
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all that I cannot do
The promise I made, the promise I made
Is starting to fade, starting to fade

Here I am, walking Primrose
Wondering when I'm gonna see you again
So here I am, walking Primrose
Wondering when I'm gonna see you again

I got my hands all ready to touch your soul
I'm gonna get the energy to wire me close to you
Got my eyes on the prize I see
Are you watching me, baby?
Cause my heart is turning to solid gold
And my head is saying, "honey, too good to be true"
But one look in your glittered eyes
Power's failing me every time

Cause
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
The promise I made, the promise I made
Is starting to fade, starting to fade babe
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all that I cannot do
The promise I made, the promise I made
Is starting to fade, starting to fade

Maybe it's not that hard to know you
Maybe we'll make it up and go
Maybe we'll work things out
There's only one way up and one way down, I know

If you wanna convince me, start again
If you wanna be with me in my arms...
Cause
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
The promise I made, the promise I made
Is starting to fade, starting to fade babe
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all that I cannot do
The promise I made, the promise I made
Is starting to fade, starting to fade
 
Maybe next time I'll take a ride on by
When I feel you near
Maybe next time I'll take a ride on by
