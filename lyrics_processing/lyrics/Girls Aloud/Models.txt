'Cause he loves the models
And he hugs the models
Goes to lunch with models
'Cause he's trying everyday
And when he sleeps with models
And he dreams of models
Wants to be a model
'Cause it's all he's got to say

Why don't you call?
Got your number, got your back on my wall
So why don't you call me?
Nothing at all
Rocks my hunger like a trip to the mall
So why don't you call me?

Why don't you call?
Why don't you call? Why don't you come around baby?
Nothing at all
You got my number and it's driving me crazy

A girl's got face, fancy place
Baby can I stick with you?
She's got heat, head to feet
Baby what am I to do?

'Cause he's trying everyday
And when he sleeps with models
And he dreams of models
Wants to be a model
'Cause it's all he's got to say

Where do you go after dinner
Instead of walking me home?
Oh, where do you go to?
Why don't you phone?
Someone thinner's got you talking in code
Oh! Sashimi at Nobu

Why don't you come around baby?
