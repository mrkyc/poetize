Disco dancin' with the lights down low
Beats are pumpin' on my stereo
Neighbour's bangin' on the bathroom wall
You're sayin', "Crank the bass, I gotta get some more"

Water's runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what is pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
And then it drops and catches like a fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes 'round and 'round
Into the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and 'round
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground

Chain reaction runnin' through my veins
Pumps the bass line up into my brain
Screws my mind until I lose control
And when the building rocks, I know it's got my soul

Water's runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what is pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
And then it drops and catches like a fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes 'round and 'round
Into the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and 'round
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground
Don't know what is pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
And then it drops and catches like fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes 'round and 'round
Into the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and 'round
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground

The bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground
The bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
