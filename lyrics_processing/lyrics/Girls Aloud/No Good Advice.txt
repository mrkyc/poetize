Daddy told me, "Look into the future
Sit at your computer, be a good girl"
And mama said, "Remember you're a lady
Think before you play and straighten your curls"
Well, everybody's talking like I'm crazy
Dangerous and lazy girl with no soul
But I've seen it all from where I'm hiding
Baby, 'cause I'm sliding out of control

Here I go, on the road, crank the stereo
I flick my finger to the world below, oh
Here I am, dirty hands, I don't give a damn
Shut your mouth because it might show

I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted
I don't need some other life
Cold and complicated
I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathising
I don't need no special fix
To anaesthetise me

Daddy always told me to remember
"Leave the boys till later, don't you drop down"
Mama said I'd never get to Heaven
Hanging till eleven, with the wrong crowd
Everybody's talking like I'm only
Just another phony girl who got played
But I dig the music that I'm making, baby
And I'll break it into your brain

Here I go, on the road, crank the stereo
I flick my finger to the world below, oh
Here I am, dirty hands, I don't give a damn
Shut your mouth because it might show

I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted
I don't need some other life
Cold and complicated
I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathising
I don't need no special fix
To anaesthetise me

I don't need no good advice
I'm already wasted
I don't need some other life
Cold and complicated
I don't need no Sunday trips
Tea and sympathising
I don't need no special fix
To anaesthetise me

I don't need no good advice
No well-intentioned sacrifice
And I don't need no Sunday trips
No chocolate box or speed for kicks
Hell, I don't need no beauty sleep
No need to count those dirty sheep
And I don't need no bedtime prayer
