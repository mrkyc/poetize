(Ave Maria)

Always hear you singing, I can't stand that song
You like my hair brunette, but I like it blonde
You lie in the sunshine, but it makes me sweat
You save all your money while I get into debt

Not the kinda guy to catch my eye
Now we're picking out the tiles and curtains
Never thought you'd be the lucky guy
Now it's the only thing I know for certain
Used to go for guys who make me cry
Never seem to find the rhyme or reason
If you love somebody, don't ask why
Cupid mystifies

Oh, when they say love's the key
An end of the road, it don't matter to me
Worth that man hanging on hold
The answer is love and no reason why
It knows where you been
Oh, but you and me just seem to fit right

I'm mocha-chocca latte, you're more espresso shot
Life and soul of the party, it's safe to say you're not
I lean towards fiction, but you deal with fact
Don't mind the friction 'cause opposites attract

Not the kinda guy to catch my eye
Now we're picking out the tiles and curtains
Never thought you'd be the lucky guy
Now it's the only thing I know for certain
Used to go for guys who make me cry
Never seem to find the rhyme or reason
If you love somebody, don't ask why
Cupid mystifies

Oh, when they say love's the key
An end of the road, it don't matter to me
Worth that man hanging on hold
The answer is love and no reason why
It knows where you been
Oh, but you and me just seem to fit right
Oh, when they say love's the key
An end of the road, it don't matter to me
Worth that man hanging on hold
The answer is love and no reason why
It knows where you been
Oh, but you and me just seem to fit right
