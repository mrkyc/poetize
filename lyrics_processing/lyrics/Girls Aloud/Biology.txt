Why don't you fool me, feed me, say you need me
Without wicked games?
Come on and hold me, hug me, say you love me
And not my dirty brain
Why don't you fool me, feed me, say you need me
Without wicked games?
Come on and hold me, hug me, say you love me
And not my dirty brain

I got one Alabama return
That'll take me far away from you
'Cause when you take me in your arms
I turn to slave, I can't be saved
So I got my cappuccino to go
And I'm heading for the hills again
'Cause if we party any more we'll start a fire
Of pure desire

Closer
Your mind's flying blind
With your head and your face getting red
And your heart beats closer
You fall on your knees
And the geek at your feet says you're neat
And the beat gets closer
You die for the thrill
At the kill and your heart's had its fill
But he still creeps closer
You want it to freeze
But you're weak, in too deep and the beat
And the beat gets closer

We give it up
And then they take it away
A girl's got to zip it up
And get her head in the shade
Baby, if we give it up
It's just a matter of time
Before all the heavy stuff
Comes back to bite your behind

You can't mistake my biology
The way that we talk
The way that we walk
It's there in our thoughts
The magic number's in front of me
The way that we talk
The way that we walk
So easily caught
You can't mistake my biology
The way that we talk
The way that we walk
It's there in our thoughts
We're gonna cause a controversy
The way that we talk
The way that we walk
So easily caught
Why don't you fool me, feed me, say you need me
Without wicked games?
Come on and hold me, hug me, say you love me
And not my dirty brain
Why don't you fool me, feed me, say you need me
