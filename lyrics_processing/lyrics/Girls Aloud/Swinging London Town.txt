Do you know the me that wakes and sees the livewire in my eyes?
The it girl with a twist girl and no one realises
That I'm living on a tightrope, I can't, I won't look down
I pussyfoot from drink to drink in swinging London Town
Kimberley:
Do you know the me that wakes the places with faces I've never seen?
The mother of all hangovers to remind me where I've been
And if I stop, I'm sickened, it really gets me down
So I step back into the city lights the queen of London Town
It's the queen of London Town
It's the queen of London Town
Nicola:
New York, Monaco, Paris and Milan
Poor little rich girl, who does it cos she can
I'm just a big time Gucci girl, a first in retail therapy
And now we're down the slide to rehab and all of it for free
And with these joke filled egos, Martini sipping chums
Gigolos, stick-thin models, hanging off their arms
I guess I'm neck deep in it, I'm starting to drown
Along with all the wannabes in swinging London Town
Cheryl:
Do you know me?
Do you know me?
Do you know me?
Really, really know me?
Do you know me?
Do you know me?
Do you know me?
Really really know me?
