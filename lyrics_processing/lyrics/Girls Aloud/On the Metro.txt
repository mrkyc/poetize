A hundred O's and X's lighting up the dark
Now they turned into a question mark

I was in my favourite party spot
Sippin' on my favourite soda pop
I saw this guy come rockin' up
So shy and out of place
His moves were so ridiculous
But he looked so meticulous
I could tell that he meant business
Getting all up in my space

I left my heart at the disco
Now I'm crying on the metro
Wrote your name on the window (on the window)
Oh baby I don't know why, why did you go?
Now I'm crying on the metro
Wrote your name on the window (on the window)
I know that you gotta feel the same, baby
But I don't have your number, only got your name
I left my heart at the disco
Now I'm crying on the metro
Now I'm crying on the metro
See Girls Aloud LiveGet tickets as low as $23You might also like
Didn't have to say one syllable
His body language said it all
We moved in closer to the wall
For a little one on one
We danced til I was minimal
Put me in a sweet delirium
I hopped into the powder room
When I came back he was gone

I left my heart at the disco
Now I'm crying on the metro
Wrote your name on the window (on the window)
Oh baby I don't know why, why did you go?
Now I'm crying on the metro
Wrote your name on the window (on the window)
I know that you gotta feel the same, baby
But I don't have your number, only got your name
I left my heart at the disco
Now I'm crying on the metro
Now I'm crying on the metro

A hundred o's and x's lighting up the dark
Now they turn into a question mark
When I came back he was gone
I left my heart at the disco
Now I'm crying on the metro
Wrote your name on the window (on the window)
Oh baby I don't know why, why did you go?
Now I'm crying on the metro
Wrote your name on the window (on the window)
I know that you gotta feel the same, baby
But I don't have your number, only got your name
I left my heart at the disco
Now I'm crying on the metro
