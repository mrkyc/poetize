All this time looking for light
All this time, I'm still trying

I gave you all my love, I took it back again
But the candle in my heart, it flickers now and then
I knew it from the start
I knew it at the end
We said it'd never work, but I still think about you every now and then
And you're out of my heart, I swear I can't pretend
But the heart tears apart as I still think about you every now and then
Every now and then
Now, like then
Right now, like then
Right now
Oh right now

Never ever going back
I said I never would again
It's better now that we're apart
But I still think about you every now and then

Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then

Never ever going back
I said I never would again
It's better now that we're apart
But I still think about you every now and then

Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then

I gave you everything
I even wore your ring
You got under my skin and you know why
You left me wondering
You let the shadows in
The seven deadly sins that you can't hide
'Cause if your loving's not enough
When the going gets tough
You give me all that you got
Or my heart won't beat again

Never ever going back
I said I never would again
It's better now that we're apart
But I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
Now and then, but I still think about you every now and then
Now and then, now and then, 'bout you every now and then
