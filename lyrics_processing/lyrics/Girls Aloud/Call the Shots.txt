Static tone on the phone, are we breaking again?
Must be something better, babe
All the names that you called out in bed seem to fade
To sometime never, but

I won't cry for all the hunger in my heart, no
I won't cry because I've made it through this far

Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh
Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh

Out of the fire that burns inside me
A phoenix is rising
If you don't feel that you can love me
I won't shoot you down

And I won't cry for all the hunger in my heart, no
No, I won't cry because I've stumbled through this far

Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh
Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh

I've seen life burn bright, seen it shimmer (Seen it shimmer)
Then fade like starlight to a glimmer (To a glimmer)
Oh, no, I've seen life flow by, like a river (Like a river)
So full of twilight, dreams that glitter (Dreams that glitter)

Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh
Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh
Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh
