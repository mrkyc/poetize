Ladies, you're damn right
You can't read a man's mind
We're living in two tribes
And heading for war
Well, nobody's perfect
We all gotta work it
But fellas, we're worth it
So, don't break the law

Your call's late, big mistake
You gotta hang about the limo for as long as I take
Next time, read my mind and I'll be good to you
We're gift wrapped kitty cats
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
*Let's go Eskimo, out into the blue*

Come take my hand, understand that you can
You're my man and I need you tonight
Come make my dreams, honey, hard as it seems
Loving me is as easy as pie-ie-ie

I'm just a love machine, feeding my fantasy
Give me a kiss or three and I'm fine
I need a squeeze a day, 'stead of this negligee
What will the neighbours say, this time?

I've been going crazy while you sleep
Searching for a language that the two of us can speak
So, Mr Prehistoric, make your wheel
And I'll breathe underwater cos I like the way it feels

Your call's late, big mistake
You gotta hang about the limo for as long as I take
Next time, read my mind and I'll be good to you
We're gift wrapped kitty cats
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
*Let's go Eskimo, out into the blue*

Come take my hand, understand that you can
You're my man and I need you tonight
Come make my dreams, honey, hard as it seems
Loving me is as easy as pie-ie-ie

I'm just a love machine, feeding my fantasy
Give me a kiss or three and I'm fine
I need a squeeze a day, 'stead of this negligee
What will the neighbours say, this time?
Oh, it's very new
Can anybody tell me what to do?
Oh, this feeling's very strange
Can anybody tell me what's your game?
Oh, a little education
Oh, to give you motivation
Oh, we turn the situation, round
Oh, cos I don't wanna change you
Oh, making you a stranger
Oh, I'll only rearrange you, for now

Oh, I'm just a love machine
(Oh, to give you motivation)
Oh, I'm just a love machine
Oh, I'm just a love machine
(Oh, to give you motivation)
Oh, I'm just a love machine
