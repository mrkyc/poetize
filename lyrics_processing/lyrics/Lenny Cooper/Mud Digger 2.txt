Pipes louder than glass packs, straight pipes, y'all know

Mud clumps be fallin' like comets, it's insane
Trucks lined up, 'bout as long as a train

I got a Jones County chick
And a big truck, big mud tires and it's jacked up
Daisy Dukes on her butt when she back it up
Drop it to the ground
Move it around and pick it back up
She ridin' shotgun through the pit
Yellin' cuss words out the window and that ain't half of it
She got a beer in her hand and didn't spill it
Wiped the mud off the can and then she killed it
