Me, myself, I like poppin' tabs
Bud Light chase it with Jim and Jack
Superstar, I'm where party's at
We deep in the woods so come on back
We hell raisers, do you like that
Oh, matter of fact, I'm throwin' cash
So pardon me, I just have to ask
What you know about a country boy with swag?

Oh, could it be?
Yeah, Lenny C, the Mud Digger King straight out of NC
I'm laid back, haters fade back
Been down to the dumps but I'm back on track
With a record deal and my country rap
And a "hot damn" and an "aww, snap"
I love the country, you don't have to ask
And I love Jack Daniels in my flask
I love my huntin', and I love my fishin'
And I damn sure love my country women
So pardon me, darlin', I just have to ask
What you know bout a country boy with swag?

Me, myself, I like poppin' tabs

Hell yeah, is what I call my truck
You think you got somethin' come try your luck
It's got diesel man it's damn sure tough, but it ain't a Ford, this truck's more buff
Like a rock it can't be topped, Chevrolet, all the way
A real man's truck's all I gotta say and the way I do it is the southern way
Call the shop, what I gotta have, I'm thinkin' of gettin' some smoke stacks
And throw the cash in money bags, 'cause that's how a country boy does it with swag

Me, myself, I like poppin' tabs
Bud Light chase it with Jim and Jack

What do you know about a country boy with some swag?
S-W-A-G, country swag, yeah that's me
Bumpin' everywhere, you know what I mean
Everything Mossy Oak and Realtree
Camo'd out, so I'm hard to see
You probably think I'm crazy, a little, yeah, just maybe
I'm too hot, you can't tame me
Me, myself, I like poppin' tabs
