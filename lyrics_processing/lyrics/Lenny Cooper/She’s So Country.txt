She's so country, she jack it up so high
Then drop it in four-low, hot like a fish fry
She's workin' it for me, that body is blazin'
I can't help these feelin's
I can't fight these feelin's, feelin's (Woo)

You-you got me star struck
With your sexy body and your jacked up truck (Yup)
You got me stutterboxin', I can barely speak
And my eyes feel like I ain't blinked in a week
Get down and dirty and I love that
You and me (Yeah) make a perfect match
You're beautiful, yeah, from the front to the back
And you're sweet like wine on a vine in a berry patch
Them shorts you're wearin' is a perfect fit
Co-country girl swag real as it gets
You're all on me like a zip tie (Zip tie)
I swear lil' mama got me hypnotized
She wanna man and I'm all that
From my cowboy boots to my ball cap
So what's up girl, whatcha wanna do?
She said "How 'bout you?" (Woo)

She's so country, she jack it up so high
Then drop it in four-low, hot like a fish fry
She's workin' it for me, that body is blazin'
I can't help these feelin's
I can't fight these feelin's, feelin's

Blonde haired thing with a sense of action
And her jeans cut short, you could see she's flashin'
