Yeah, I'm him
The one who's reppin' for the country (Country)
The one who's stuntin', ridin' muddy
Yeah, I'm him
The one who keeps his speakers bumpin' (Bumpin')
The one that drives the girls crazy 'cause they love me
Yeah, I'm him (Love me)
The one who's got that master flow
Blowin' smoke from local to international (National)
Yeah, I'm him
The one who was raised up in the sticks
The mud digger, don't you ever forget
Yeah, cause I'm him

I used to sit back be that never run my mouth boy
But now I'm that one who gets wild in the crowd boy (Yeah)
I keep it country, wherever I'm at
Never worried, I got that club mud crew that always got my back (Yup)
So if you want it then come and get it
My rhymes are well invented, I write it on how I live it
My swag on full, never empty
Beer ya, I got plenty, raise hell yeah I'm always ready
Tear up a track, you can call me Richard Petty
Oh, I'm givin' y'all some country with some bang
No more holdin' back, for now I'ma bring in the gang
Where it's headed, nowhere, in the woods or in a Jon boat
We spittin' lyrics, gnawin' bucks, or fishin' in a honey hole

I welcome competition, y'all can keep on comin' with it
Think I'm jokin', then y'all just keep on messin' with me
I have no time for rumors or stupid chitter chatter
I work hard and live a life that truly matters
Start it up, then drop it down in four low
So loud it sounds like a war zone (Boom boom)
I got them subwoofers knockin'
Once you rev up, uh oh, ain't no stoppin'
Standin' by a fire barrel, drinkin' beer that's ice cold
Sippin' on some shine 'cause that's how a country boy roll
Walkin' tall with black and camo, why I'll be wearin'
With a Chevy chain and people askin' is that
Yeah, I'm him
