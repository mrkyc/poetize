I'm tryna' to tell you these country girls don't play
Just one look make you feel a type of way
She grew up off collards and yams
Just enough junk in the trunk like bam and a tan for days
Damn straight I can tell she's country made
Baby, she gotta be country made
Yeah, yeah, grew up off collards and yams
Just enough junk in the trunk like bam and a tan for days
Damn straight I can tell she's country made
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)

Country made like some collard and gritts
Talkin' deep down south, 'bout as good as it gets you know
Them shorty shorts that make the cheeks of her butt show
Got a country boy like whoa
They don't make 'em like this in the city
She can hunt, she can fish, and she still look pretty
Looks cute in them boots and he shows no pity
And she by my side 'til the real nitty gritty
Made me wanna call her mama say thank you ma'am
Drink a beer with her daddy and shake his hand
She ain't gotta wear a dress to impress me
Blue jeans, t-shirt, Realtree
Around her I can always be the real me
I make a man get down on one knee
Look her in the eyes ask her "What's it gonna be"
Anything that you need, girl it's on me

(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)

Her daddy taught her right, taught her how to load a gun (Yeah)
How to fish and hunt, and how to get a job done
Known to get her hands dirty, hair up in a bun
And she stays lookin' fine, man I swear like she's the one
She's bangin', (She bangin') but she made me go straight
Think about her while I'm on the road and I'm away
She give me my own space she know I gotta get paid
'Cause she really likes spendin' all the money that I made
But I'm straight, 'cause we make a lot of change
Ridin' like we're Bonnie and Clyde in our own lane
She my ride or die and it goes both ways
Got me listenin' to that Lonestar, baby I'm amazed, uh
If she want it she can get it
Country as a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken
Butter on the biscuits, all of the fixin's
Finger lickin' and I'm about to dig in
I'm tryna' to tell you these country girls don't play
Just one look make you feel a type of way
She grew up off collards and yams
Just enough junk in the trunk like bam and a tan for days
Damn straight I can tell she's country made
Baby, she gotta be country made
Yeah, yeah, grew up off collards and yams
Just enough junk in the trunk like bam and a tan for days
