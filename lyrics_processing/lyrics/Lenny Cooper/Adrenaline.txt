Adrenaline pumpin' in my tires, I got them 54 inch mud swampers
I got them hoses cuh cuh, muffler's spittin' some flames
I got some girls in the back and they ain't wearin' a thing
Adrenaline pumpin' in my tires, I got them 54 inch mud swampers
I'm in a hell of a hole, I slam my foot on the gas
I drive my truck like it's stole, I've been told I'm a junkie for adrenaline

Big truck, big tires, adrenaline pumpin' and I'm ready to ride (That's right)
Full blast, non-stop, pop the top 'cause I'm ready to rock
Got the hubs locked and the clutch popped
And them horses sing from my big block
Big Chevy over top and I got that system with some serious drops
The ladies love it, when they in my bed they wearin' barely nothin'
And by the end of the night I'm gon' be into somethin' (Into somethin')
She shake it fast, dancin' on that pole in the back (God dang)
Sexy girls and mud holes, that's just how us mud stars roll
