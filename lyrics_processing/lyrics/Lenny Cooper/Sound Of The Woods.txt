If you listen real quiet, down an old dirt road
Deep back off the map, that's where you gotta go
To hear the sound of the woods, that's the sound of the woods
Where the boys get drunk, and them ladies get wild
Hear the brush fire pop and then engines get loud
That's the sound of the woods, that's the sound of the woods

I got my middle finger up for the haters who watchin'
My music on the charts, and they in the garbage
Feeling so good, right now optimistic
I make my moves reality and you unrealistic
I'm all about action when I'm puttin' my shades on
Chevy chain that hang off my neck about yay long
Right now my music hotter than market
212 frequency shakin' the cockpit
I bat her up and knock it straight out the park
My fists hit so hard, my arms are supercharged
You think I fell off, hell naw
I just waited for the perfect time to set this bomb off
Keep thinkin' you can be the boss
People talkin' hard, but actin' soft
I keep ridin' dirt roads
The rest of y'all can get lost (Get lost, get lost)
The rest of y'all can get lost (Get lost, get lost)
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You might also like
If you listen real quiet, down an old dirt road
Deep back off the map, that's where you gotta go
To hear the sound of the woods, (The sound of the woods) that's the sound of the woods (That's the sound of the woods)
Where the boys get drunk, (Get drunk) and them ladies get wild (Get wild)
Hear the brush fire pop (Fire pop) and then engines get loud (Get loud)
That's the sound of the woods, (That's the sound of the woods) that's the sound of the woods (Yeah, that's the sound of the woods)

Well it's a profound sound found only around these parts
Around town, there ain't no truck around when it gets dark
We mountain ride, to the mountain side
With them Kenwoods boun-boun-boun-bouncin' right
Welcome to the life of a backwoods guy
Got them bonfire nights turning dark into daylight
Awake like an owl, we get down with the moonlight
So I write songs for my type
The type that like to raise a little hell
Pumpin' shotgun shells out the barrel of a 12 gauge
While barrelin' around the curvy dirt road drunk barely awake
Some folks want to escape but I ain't
I'd rather sit and write another song about the reasons that I'm gonna keep on sittin' on the tailgate
And what comes out on my writin' sessions is so good
There ain't no question this is the sound of the woods

If you listen real quiet, down an old dirt road
Deep back off the map, that's where you gotta go
To hear the sound of the woods, (The sound of the woods) that's the sound of the woods (That's the sound of the woods)
Where the boys get drunk, (Get drunk) and them ladies get wild (Get wild)
Hear the brush fire pop (Fire pop) and then engines get loud (Get loud)
