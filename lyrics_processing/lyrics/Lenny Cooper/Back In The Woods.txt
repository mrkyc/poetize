There's a party goin' down, so turn it up
Country girls shakin' with them Dixie cups
Say she wanna ride with me, and that's alright
Tell your boys to come down, we ain't scared to fight
This is my hood, sippin' that good
And we're way back, way back in the woods
Moonshine whiskey and tan lines
That's one hell of a night

I'm about to have one hell of a night so I call my buddy Tyler (Wassup)
I know you've heard of moonshiners (We about to have us a bonfire)
Tell 'em go and light it up, heat the still and make that good stuff
Meet at a party deep in the woods, po-po it up, po-po it up
Got the music crankin', the speakers bangin'
Us country folks do a little drinkin'
Got a shine and whiskey passin'
Get up bull, how long you lastin'?
Feelin' good, real optimistic
Sober now, so barely twisted
Sittin' on a tailgate of a Chevy superiorly lifted
We don't even play boy, everything's uncensored
Keep centerfolds around me, like a mudbog Hue Hefner
Meat is grillin', drinks are spillin', Dixie cups need refillin'
Way back, back in the woods, country folks straight chillin'

And we're way back, way back in the woods
Moonshine whiskey and tan lines
That's one hell of a night

Lift up on my dip cup we veterans won't throw up
We lite fires with gasoline, shot shit 'til it blow up
I got a spot nobody knows, I grabbed her and said let's go
We hooked up like a repo, then bounced out, rodeo
Tan lines and tail lights, those back woods country life
She loves sippin' that get right
Recipe for a good night
She revved up, max her flow
Body movin', vertigo
And when the bass drops she gets low
Let's loose and lose control
Stars shine, bonfire burnin' off in the distance
We jumped in that five speed and fired up them pistons
Tearin' ass through the woods movin' with that quickness
You knew they heard us comin' from the way she bump that system
There's a party goin' down, so turn it up
Country girls shakin' with them Dixie cups
Say she wanna ride with me, and that's alright
Tell your boys to come down, we ain't scared to fight
This is my hood, sippin' that good
And we're way back, way back in the woods
Moonshine whiskey and tan lines
That's one hell of a night

Fe-fe-fe-feelin' good

Good, good, good, good
