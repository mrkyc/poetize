I got three things that cure me and one is Jim Beam
Second is my psychic Jack, I don't know when I'm comin' back
I keep the Crown for back up just to fill this fact up
Lord, I know I need to stop fore I'm long gone and forgot

But these three damn bottles that I call my friends
When I think about it now, hell I'm filled up with sin
Lord, it's bad but they help me take all this pain away
It's time to change, I'm ready to be saved
I'm callin' out your name Lord
Three damn bottles that I call my friends
When I think about it now, hell I'm filled up with sin
Lord, it's bad but they help me take all this pain away
It's time to change, I'm ready to be saved
I'm callin' out your name Lord

Singin' "Whiskey Lullaby" on a lonely night
Wishin' I had a good woman to sit right by my side
Hell, I'm drunk and I'm lost with this alcohol drama
That I bring myself down to a lost drunken coma
Then I wake up, prayin' to change me to the man I want to be
And please take me away from this powerful whiskey
This stuff is risky than three bottles in the counter in the kitchen
Hopin' and wishin' that what I'm sayin' that the Lord is listenin'
You might also like
But these three damn bottles that I call my friends
When I think about it now, hell I'm filled up with sin
Lord, it's bad but they help me take all this pain away
It's time to change, I'm ready to be saved
I'm callin' out your name Lord
Three damn bottles that I call my friends
When I think about it now, hell I'm filled up with sin
Lord, it's bad but they help me take all this pain away
It's time to change, I'm ready to be saved
I'm callin' out your name Lord

But what do you know, been on the wagon for three weeks
I worked hard to talk myself out of every drink
The legend says don't go and bite a dog that bit you
My mind is made strong, tellin' me the right thing to do
Just walk away and leave them bottles and keep my cool
And not to go back and make myself look like a fool
So my mind is made up to put them bottles in the trash
And walk away, and never turn back

But these three damn bottles that I call my friends
When I think about it now, hell I'm filled up with sin
Lord, it's bad but they help me take all this pain away
It's time to change, I'm ready to be saved
I'm callin' out your name Lord

But these three damn bottles that I call my friends
When I think about it now, hell I'm filled up with sin
Lord, it's bad but they help me take all this pain away
It's time to change, I'm ready to be saved
I'm callin' out your name Lord
Three damn bottles that I call my friends
When I think about it now, hell I'm filled up with sin
Lord, it's bad but they help me take all this pain away
It's time to change, I'm ready to be saved
