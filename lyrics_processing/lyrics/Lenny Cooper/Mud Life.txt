Sippin' my Bud Light, flippin' on my flood lights
Big ol' tires, sittin' high, we just livin' that mud life
My girl got boots on, my best friend is a buck knife
We really ridin' dirty, livin' that mud life

Drop the chains, lets hook em up
Sittin' so tall you break your neck to look up
Dunk tub, come get some
Sexy girls, they ready to have fun
Better grab the cups, I'll pack the steel
Country folks, come get your feel
Load the guns, we got shit to kill
Say I won't, but you know I will
She hot as fire, and cold as Budweiser, surprised I can't get enough
She the mud, I can dig 'em bro
She the one, I'm gon' grab her up
Lets light the fuse on this shindig, watch it blow up in an instant
Ain't drunk yet, but I'm fixin' to get
It's mud life and I'm livin' it

Sippin' my Bud Light, flippin' on my flood lights
Big ol' tires, sittin' high, we just livin' that mud life
My girl got boots on, my best friend is a buck knife
We really ridin' dirty, livin' that mud life

I'm drunk and crunk, crank the radio up
This beat the bomb, yeah it's the shit
Make the speakers hit
My girl be bouncin', body rockin', there ain't no stoppin'
Daisy dukes ripped up, them sexy legs about to drive me nuts
You feelin' where I'm comin' from
Go on tell em some more, I got this son
Bluefoot, the hotel room terrorist
Redneck band, my terror is
Bars and clubs they all scared of us
When we get drunk, we wreckin' shit
And I ain't fake with this mud life, pull you out when you're stuck tight
Give you a beer so you can get right, then do it again, this is the mud life

Sippin' my Bud Light, flippin' on my flood lights
Big ol' tires, sittin' high, we just livin' that mud life
My girl got boots on, my best friend is a buck knife
We really ridin' dirty, livin' that mud life

We live that mud life, hell yeah
We live that mud life, hell yeah
We live that mud life, hell yeah
We live that mud life, hell yeah
Sippin' my Bud Light, flippin' on my flood lights
Big ol' tires, sittin' high, we just livin' that mud life
My girl got boots on, my best friend is a buck knife
