Take two steps forward and one step back
Then slide to the right and then you tip your hat
Then you barrel roll to the left then you take two more steps
Then bring it on back to this hillbilly dance

Come on and give it go
Get your ass right on the dance floor
This right here is the dance of the south
For country boys and girls who love to get down
It's easy to learn even if you're tipsy
All you gotta do is listen to me
So go 'head order a shot of whiskey
And get on the floor and do the hillbilly

Take two steps forward and one step back (Back, back)
Then slide to the right and then you tip your hat
Then you barrel roll to the left then you take two more steps (Steps)
Then bring it on back to this hillbilly dance
Then take two steps forward and one step back (Back, back)
Then slide to the right and then you tip your hat
Then you barrel roll to the left then you take two more steps (Steps)
Then bring it on back to this hillbilly dance

Giddy on up now and get in the groove
We 'gon break it down
To the biggest line dance you've ever seen
Can I get a Yeehaw (Yeehaw) yeah feelin' me
There's no more being bored just get on the floor
This song right here you can't ignore
It'll make you dance 'til you can't no more
It'll damn near make you tear up the floor
Its party time bottom line
Grab your jar and hit up the shine
Taste is sweet green lime or peach or grape or the best apple pie
So bottoms up, fill up your cup
Raise your glasses, take a sip and get out of your seat
And get on the floor and join me for the hillbilly

Take two steps forward and one step back (Back, back)
Then slide to the right and then you tip your hat
Then you barrel roll to the left then you take two more steps
Then bring it on back to this hillbilly dance
Then take two steps forward and one step back (Back, back)
Then slide to the right and then you tip your hat
Then you barrel roll to the left then you take two more steps (Steps)
Then bring it on back to this hillbilly dance
Right foot stomp the ground
Left foot stomp the group
Drop it down and slap the ground
Pop back up and turn around
Right foot stomp the ground
Left foot stomp the group
Drop it down and slap the ground
Pop back up and turn around

Take two steps forward and one step back
Then slide to the right and then you tip your hat
