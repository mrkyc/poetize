'Cause all I know, is that time sure shows
Sometimes it's hard to let go, feelings seem to grow
But I'm finding a life, where I'm at feels right
And this is my cloud nine, this land of mine
Living life out in the pines
Yeah, whoa
Living life out in the pines
Yeah, whoa

My daddy was a hard workin' man
Could fix anything with his own two hands
Mr. Macgyver is what he called himself
Would be there for anybody if they ever needed help (Yup)
I would always love when he would take me fishin'
Or help me with my bike when it needed fixin'
He was the one who gave me my mission
He's been gone eleven years now Lord I sure miss him
But there's no better way to say when you live your life
To the true southern way, to not back down
To never be afraid I think my pops for the way I was raised

'Cause all I know, is that time sure shows
Sometimes it's hard to let go, feelings seem to grow
But I'm finding a life, where I'm at feels right
And this is my cloud nine, this land of mine
Living life out in the pines
Yeah, whoa
Living life out in the pines
Yeah, whoa
You might also like
Wide open, that's how I live
Swing on the front porch over lookin' the field
No honking horns or no loud sirens
Just relaxing sounds of birds and crickets chirpin' and chimin' (That's right)
I spend my time with family and friends
We enjoy the fire up the grill and smoke us some ribs
Or walk to the pond catch a couple of fish
Or sit by a fire with a guitar playing a couple of riffs
This country life's as real as it gets
I'm a true rebel here with no regrets
My wife and daughter keep me strong
'Cause there ain't no place like home

'Cause all I know, is that time sure shows
Sometimes it's hard to let go, feelings seem to grow
But I'm finding a life, where I'm at feels right
And this is my cloud nine, this land of mine
Living life out in the pines
Yeah, whoa
Living life out in the pines
Yeah, whoa
'Cause all I know, is that time sure shows
Sometimes it's hard to let go, feelings seem to grow
But I'm finding a life, where I'm at feels right
And this is my cloud nine, this land of mine
Living life out in the pines
Yeah, whoa
Living life out in the pines
