All the hoes coughin' truck exhaust poppin'
Middle of Newberry got the parkin' lot rockin'
Old folks hate but they still steadily watchin'
Wishin' we would quit but us rednecks ain't stoppin'
We mud boggin' you stuck watchin'
Wishin' you could be with us 'cause the party poppin'
You say you can dig man we ain't seen nothin'
Your girl wanna be with us now I heard she said she wants a

Mud digger
We kick the mud by the pound
Our tires stay roarin' while we ridin' through the town
Mud digger
And I keep a bad truck around
Big truck tall suspension 40 inches from the ground
Mud digger
And my Chevy sittin' on 44's
Pipes louder than glass packs straight pipes y'all know
Mud digger
If y'all don't know how the mud diggin' goes
Then get a couple of tickets to a mud boggin' show

Hot damn it's your boy Colt Ford on this bitch
In a rocky ridge lift, nuts hangin' from my hitch
I'm sittin' 'bout five feet from the concrete
Hear them Mickey Thompson's roar when I'm comin' down the street
You can keep your 24's 'cause we got 44's
Magnum's and tires, whatever you desire
Any way you want it we can do it in the mud
Ask anyone around here they tell you what's up
We some

Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you
Feeling that it's gone can change your mind
If we can't go on to survive the tide, love divides
