Down an old back road (Road)
Down an old back road, back road (Road)

There's no other place I'd rather go to relax (Relax)
I keep my seat back low (Back low)
Twelve pack beside me and it's ice cold (Ice cold)
Pop the top and let the alcohol flow
Got the speakers beatin' to a country song
Let out my stress until it's all gone (All gone)
Just somethin' 'bout chillin' out where the corn grows
I like to clear my mind down an old back road (Road)

Today I got some weight up on my shoulders
Just left the house, my girl told me it was over
She was done, had enough, and all of the above
It's a shame 'cause for her I had so much love (Much love)
I'm drivin' around my mind twisted like a Twizzler
Tryna figure out what wrong that I did to her
Then I get to thinkin', "Oh well, it's her loss"
And for once I can say "That it ain't my fault"
It's time to pop a top and throw one back
And start livin' for today, say to hell with the past
And be a winner, if you're not first, you're last
And for all you haters out there kiss my ass
I got a dream, and that's to be on top
It's gonna be a tough battle just to take my spot (Come on)
The king is here, but for now I gotta go
I'll be clearin' my mind down an old back road

It's hard when you sittin' all by yourself (All alone)
You live paycheck to paycheck without no help (Nope)
You try to keep food on the table
You do anything you can just to stay stable
You pray for a better day, wish all the bad away
Keep your head up when everything's feelin' grey
Think goody good even though it ain't there
And your dad is sayin', "Well, it'll get better next year."
Sometimes you just need a helpin' hand (A little help)
When things are crammed up like a traffic jam
Thank God, for family and friends
That help turn your life around from a dead end
I've been there, done that numerous times
I just grab the keys then I go take a little ride
And there's a place where you need to let your worries go
I call it clearin' my mind down an old back road
There's no other place I'd rather go to relax
I keep my seat back low
Twelve pack beside me and it's ice cold
Pop the top and let the alcohol flow
Got the speakers beatin' to a country song
Let out my stress until it's all gone
Just somethin' 'bout chillin' out where the corn grows
I like to clear my mind down an old back road
