Muddy Christmas baby

Now I know this sounds insane before for the holidays
I want to do something crazy with you
I want to load the cooler up, put it in my truck
Then hit a mud hole or two
Put our problems all away and thank God for this great day
That he blessed for me and you
Now here's the keys to my truck, start it up lets go
Darlin' this is my present for you

I'll be your Santa baby, tell me what you need
You want my truck, you know it baby, well here's the keys
Take me anywhere, that you wanna go
She said she gonna take me down and ol' backroad
My simple lady know she dealin' with a simple man
Her pretty eyes sparklin' just like a Christmas ornament
Not a care in the world 'cause we just ridin'
You know I don't want this night to end just like Luke Bryan

My little candy cane workin' it, she get 'er done
Lookin' good shiftin' gears in my Chevy half ton
This country girl knows how to work a stick
You know grits, this girl ain't no city chick
She lookin' good, body rockin', she a show stopper
When she dance I can't help but to freeze and watch her
She asks me if she can hit the next mud hole
I said you go ahead girl hit the gas lets rock 'n roll
