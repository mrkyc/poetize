We mud boggin' you stuck watchin'
Wishin' you can be with us 'cause the party poppin'
You say you can dig man we ain't seen nothin'
Your girl wanna be with us now I heard she said she wants a

Mud digger
We kick the mud by the pound
Our tires stay roarin' while we ridin' through the town
Mud digger
And I keep a bad truck around
Big truck tall suspension 40 inches from the ground
Mud digger
And my Chevy sittin' on 44s
Pipes louder than glass packs straight pipes y'all know
Mud digger
If y'all don't know how the mud diggin' goes
Then get a couple of tickets to a mud boggin' show

Yeah I'm a rockstar mud on my everything
You need a mud bog packed out well I'll bring my gang
You want a show I go and blow it out the frame
'Bout to party with some shawties that can easily be arranged (Yeah)
A lot of people think they gonna push me out the way
No way Jose, promise not gon' be today (Nope)
I'll be here for a while writin' hits just like this
And take it higher with a rough country lift kit
You might also like
Man I love this, you got a big truck it's your buddy buddy
I'm knee deep in the pit rockin' the muddy muddy
The goodie goodies frown, country folks love me
And your girl keeps grabbin' my beard, can't get enough of me
Says she wants to ride, and drink while I drive
Without a seat belt on, I think I'll let her slide
She lookin' fine in them boots and dukes
Crawlin' up in the single cab, we call it a Lenny Cooper
We some

350 crate engine cause a earthquake
Chevy K-10, body is still built like a tank
Quarter straight flyin' out of the gate
It's all day full tank burnin' gas in both ways
Head spinnin', seven to eight suspension
Open it up and listen, them pipes singin' and whistlin'
Chop shop the bestest, pearlescent and glistenin'
Shout out Steve Glisson trucks are higher than the ceilin'
I'm a mud digger
Mud the same color as that smoke in my rearview
Gimme one shot, Brahma Bull, don't steer through
Whatcha gonna do when that mud comes near you
Pipes yelping like a Kerr dog, I don't hear you
Fear you, hell naw we don't do that
Hit that mud hole, sling it deep like a quarterback
Comin' back, boomerangs, smokin' like a freight train
Hear me sing for the scene, yeah mud diggin' thang

I've been ridin' pretty in this old 85 (Yeah)
Four fours hummin' in the black bowtie
Just an outlaw muddin' with my foot up on the gas (Yeah)
Big tires runnin' up a stock boys ass
With that rumble of the engine and that apple pie shine
Load them 4x4's in them side by sides
We don't ever get stuck 'cause we ride too high
Love that look on your face when we rollin' by
It's your muddy buddy baby girl do you wanna to ride
Well put that big booty in my truck by my side
Let's head out of town burn a back road down
Find the outskirts, tear up the dirt
And tell your boyfriend I said "nice to meet ya"
And tell them city girls I said "bye Felicia"
We out here in the mud just tearin' shit up
Ain't no need for y'all to ever worry 'bout us
'Cause we some

All the hoes coughin' truck exhaust poppin'
Middle of Newberry got the parkin' lot rockin'
Old folks hate but they still steadily watchin'
Wishin' we would quit but us rednecks ain't stoppin'
