Bl-blacked out Duramax, speakers 'bout to bust, bust
Moonlight bright, sh-shinin' off the dust
Se-se-se-seat leaned back, ridin' way jacked up, jacked up
Yeah, I love this way of life, I can never get enough

If you got a damn problem, promise talkin' ain't gonna solve it
Seat leaned back, ridin' way jacked up
Yeah, we love this way of life so come on join us with your trucks
Need to get on this movement, dirtified we be cruisin'
All real no illusions, some come and see how we do it
Turn the keys start it up, mash the gas burn some rub'
Crank it up on the subs, cakin' mud, show some love

Yeah, whistlin' Dixie, gas trucks y'all can miss me
Ridin' high in the four-wheel drive sippin' hella whiskey

Red, white, blue, we loud and proud
Speakers bumpin', thumpin', I'm just out here chasin' mud (Chasin' mud)
All the girls wanna drive, baby, we can't get enough (Enough)
And that matte black Duramax kickin' up some dust
Shout out to the farm trucks with the high mileage and rust
We gon' heat it up like some glow plugs (Glow plugs)

From Alabama, right next to Mississippi
Where we like to roll deep, we like to sit high
Whiskey bent, yah, you can see it in my eye
