I wanna hear you say
I wanna hear you say what you think of me
'Cause you're the only one I wanna see
Baby, please say what you think of me
'Cause in your arms is where I wanna be, baby

Girl you're my daisy, I got love for you like crazy (Crazy)
Now that you're my lady, now the one I call my baby (Baby)
From when we first started out, hangin out, late nights on the town
Girl, I was blessed when you said, "Yes," at that night when my knee hit the ground
I'm always here for you, and you know you here for me
The greatest couple, we meant to be
Girl, you the waves to my sea
You my firecracker, I'm your spark
You the best part that fills up my heart
Just know I could never be without you
Just know every single word here is about you, girl

I wanna hear you say what you think of me
'Cause you're the only one I wanna see
Baby, please say what you think of me
'Cause in your arms is where I wanna be
I wanna hear you say what you think of me
'Cause you're the only one I wanna see
Baby, please say what you think of me
'Cause in your arms is where I wanna be, baby

Past relationships people know me as a mess-up (Mess-up)
Me changin' girls like I do my clothes up in my dresser
And you can best believe I've been done wrong too
They can say what they want, I'm just like any other regular dude (Just a regular dude)
Runnin' around 'cause I didn't know what the hell to do
My actions were made foolish 'cause I was so damn confused
But you can trust me when I say these words, "I love you" (I love you)
Straight from my heart 'cause it's the truth, these words are always meant for you

I wanna hear you say what you think of me
'Cause you're the only one I wanna see (Oh you'll see)
Baby, please say what you think of me
'Cause in your arms is where I wanna be
I wanna hear you say what you think of me
'Cause you're the only one I wanna see (Oh you'll see)
Baby, please say what you think of me
'Cause in your arms is where I wanna be, baby

I've learned a lot from the past, all the relationships I've been in
Hell, most were okay, but me and you
I know we can take it 'til the end
There's a lot of love I feel with us, together
No day's a bad day when I'm with you
My heart will always be yours
You're my sun that brightens my day
You're the moonlight to my night, the warm feelin' to my soul
I just want you to know, I'm forever yours
I love you
I wanna hear you say what you think of me
'Cause you're the only one I wanna see (Oh you'll see)
Baby, please say what you think of me
'Cause in your arms is where I wanna be
I wanna hear you say what you think of me
'Cause you're the only one I wanna see (Oh you'll see)
Baby, please say what you think of me
