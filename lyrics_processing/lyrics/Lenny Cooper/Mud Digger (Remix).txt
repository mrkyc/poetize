All the hoes coughin' truck exhaust poppin'
Middle of Newberry got the parkin' lot rockin'
Old folks hate but they still steadily watchin'
Wishin' we would quit but us rednecks ain't stoppin'
We mud boggin' you stuck watchin'
Wishin' you could be with us 'cause the party poppin'
You say you can dig man we ain't seen nothin'
Your girl wanna be with us now I heard she said she wants a

Mud digger
We kick the mud by the pound
Our tires stay roarin' while we ridin' through the town
Mud digger
And I keep a bad truck around
Big truck tall suspension 40 inches from the ground
Mud digger
And my Chevy sittin' on 44's
Pipes louder than glass packs straight pipes y'all know
Mud digger
If y'all don't know how the mud diggin' goes
Then get a couple of tickets to a mud boggin' show

Hot damn it's your boy Colt Ford on this bitch
In a rocky ridge lift, nuts hangin' from my hitch
I'm sittin' 'bout five feet from the concrete
Hear them Mickey Thompson's roar when I'm comin' down the street
You can keep your 24's 'cause we got 44's
Magnum's and tires, whatever you desire
Any way you want it we can do it in the mud
Ask anyone around here they tell you what's up
We some

We don't rock them gangster clothes we be wearin' Wrangler jeans
People rollin' with them AT's
We be muddin' jumpin' stuntin' hummin' with the mud king mt's
Here comes RC in that 2500hd
Ask again has he hit any ditches lately
Big D muddin' chuggin' beers three seconds 'til they empty
I see you muddin' with me 'cause we some

You gon' always hear me showin' love for my mud
Cold beer, big deer, country girl's butts
Coon dogs, cooked hogs, nothin' like a mud bog
This is where it's at son, better go get you one
Lift kit, no shit, jack up your granny's car
Take it to the bog you can be a mud superstar
It's a lifestyle baby, now you know what's up
Every single day we gon' do it in the mud
