Yeah, I admit, I really did it in
Messed up, yeah it sucks that I lost your trust
Now you ain't by my side in the back of my truck
No more butterflies or makin' you blush
I want to clear out this cloudy weather
So I can bring the sun out to make it all better
Be the man that you want as I'm makin' you smile
That happy little face I ain't seen in a while
What I did wasn't right and it's gonna be tough
And I know that enough is enough
I'm doin' all I can, not makin' it up
You just keep on kickin' it up that same ole dust

Well I know this road gets a little rough
Time to put it in gear and get out of this rut
Gonna dry those tears before you rust
But you keep kickin' up the same old dust
If I cover my eyes would you be there
When all the mess and debris clears
Wanna change my ways and get back your trust
But you keep kickin' up the same ole dust
The same ole dust

I gave you chance after chance but it wasn't enough
You said you'd change your ways to get back my trust
I love listenin' to lies when I know they ain't the truth
But now it's time to let you go out and do you
Used to hold my hand and answer every call
Now you wouldn't even think to pick me up if I fall
We'd drive around I turn the radio up
But now I see you ridin' around with other girls in your truck
Don't wanno have to go through all this again
I couldn't tell you when the craziness is gonna end
Take a second to rewind
I can tell you one more time
You gonna keep on kickin' it up, that same ole dust
You might also like
Well I know this road gets a little rough
Time to put it in gear and get out of this rut
Gonna dry those tears before you rust
But you keep kickin' up the same old dust
If I cover my eyes would you be there
When all the mess and debris clears
Wanna change my ways and get back your trust
But you keep kickin' up the same ole dust
The same ole dust

Been goin' back and forth in this tug of war
And it's harder than it has to be
I gave you chance after chance but it wasn't enough
Now you ain't comin' back to me

Well I know this road gets a little rough
Time to put it in gear and get out of this rut
Gonna dry those tears before you rust
But you keep kickin' up the same old dust
If I cover my eyes would you be there
When all the mess and debris clears
Wanna change my ways and get back your trust
But you keep kickin' up the same ole dust
(Drive around and turn the radio up)
The same ole dust
(I see you drive around with other girls in your truck)
The same ole dust
(I gave you chance after chance but it wasn't enough)
The same ole dust
