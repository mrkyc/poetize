Want a country boy with mud on his boots
Rough hands and his grip ain't loose
A tractor man with hands on the wheel
Gonna get down and plow my field
We own them gravel roads
Bumpin' 12's shootin' whiskey
I'll be your dirty girl so come on and get dirty with me

Oh yes I can, I'm a dirty man
Callused hands with a farmers tan
We can shoot some whiskey, get frisky
Little quickie, I'll be your hillbilly
Really, we can take it down a dirt road
Rodeo, she put on a show, woah
My dirty girl, with a dirtified stamped on her shirt
On that RZR, she does work
The way she play got me lost for words
I, I, I can't explain, she got me wrapped up in a snatch chain
And I'm game, for whatever she wants
I'll do whatever it takes, make no mistakes
Hey, get it get it vibrate, make ya legs shake
Aftermath like Doc Dre
Hit it 'til ya toes break

She want a real man that can take her to the field
Likes it dirty and totes a steel
Goes huntin', brings home a meal
He got stacks on deck, he can pay them bills, for real
She about that business, got her on the top spot on my hitlist
It turns her on when she hears me spit this
She really love me, she cannot quick this
Vicious. With a tat on her thigh
Little bitty shorts that can make a man sigh
Damn she right, make me wanna put lips on her like a mic
And I might take her home tonight
She got friends, and that's alright
'Cause I got boys, they feelin' hype
We hit a dirt road, cut off the lights

Want a country boy with mud on his boots
Rough hands and his grip ain't loose
A tractor man with hands on the wheel
Gonna get down and plow my field
We own them gravel roads
Bumpin' 12's, shootin' whiskey
I'll be your dirty girl so come on and get dirty with me
