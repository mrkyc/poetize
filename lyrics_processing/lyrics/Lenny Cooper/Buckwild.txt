If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it big
Raise a little hell yeah that's the way we live
Feelin', feelin' good, country boy style
Only live once, so we stay buckwild
Buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buckwild

I got this whole thing jumpin' ain't it somethin', mention my name
Brings rowdy folks out from the country, women dress insane
With them short shorts holdin' tall boys, take a smoke right to the brain
Ladies love them country boys, some things just ain't gonna change (Just ain't gonna change)
Belly button for shot glasses that ain't filled with that store bought
Made fresh down by the river 'bout a hundred yards from my huntin' spot
And that's the way we like it, and that's the way we live it
And I've been doing the stuff for years, yeah it's family tradition
They get low to Carolina flow this speaker about to blow
So who brought the party? Well they better bring some more
Good Lordy Lordy, everybody get lit
Shadows long from the fire, time to take another sip

If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it big
Raise a little hell yeah that's the way we live
Feelin', feelin' good, country boy style
Only live once, so we stay buckwild
Buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild what
And we stay buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buckwild, buckwild

Pedal to the floorboard 'til I'm runnin' on nothin' but fumes
Then throw a little prime shine in the tank and get back to the groove
So call me the wild child 'cause I was born a hell raisin' dude (Dude)
But big is all I know, that's how I roll so don't get stuck
Y'all I'm buying thirty packs, hell I'm buyin' the beer truck (Truck)
Party harder than a redneck at Mardi Gras with the beads
Havin' fun that's all that's on my agenda to achieve
With a big block in my truck, (Truck) big tires for the diggin' (Diggin')
You think you can top me, nah dog you must be trippin' (Trippin')
Let me paint a vision, (Vision) about this country livin' (Livin')
Moonshine, some cold beer, and a lot of sexy women (Yup)

If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it big
Raise a little hell yeah that's the way we live
Feelin', feelin' good, country boy style
Only live once, so we stay buckwild
Buckwild, buckwild what
