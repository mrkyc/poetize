Blacked out Duramax, speakers 'bout to bust, bust
Moon light bright, sh-shinin' off the dust
Seat leaned back, ridin' way jacked up
Yeah, I love this way of life, I can never get enough

I've got a blacked out Duramax
A 12 inch smokestack, four 12's in the back
Poundin hard like a whack-a-pack
All the girls wanna ride six of 'em in the back
With the camo dash nah, they can't get enough of that
Yeah, I love this way of life, I can never get enough
Young Gunner on the radio (You know my truck is jacked up)
Carolina, Georgia, Florida I will always represent it
Rockin' mud blood if you ain't seen it then you gotta get it
Love the way my Chevrolet compliments my Chevy chain
Mud Digger King and at the top is where I still remain
Good ole country boys somethin' bought me that'll never change
You'll never get on my level as long as I'm up in this game

Blacked out Duramax, speakers 'bout to bust, bust
Moon light bright, sh-shinin' off the dust

Yeah, I love this way of life, I can never get enough

I got that Duramax power rollin' coal out by the hour
And I keep these yuppies sour 'cause I'm taller than the tower
If you pull up right beside me make you tuck your head and cower
I'ma rain on your parade and blow some smoke out on your flowers
Yeah, I'm peellin' off and grinnin' with a Chevy full of women
Leave you in a cloud of smoke with my tires spinnin'
I'm gone, jammin' hick-hop in my zone
'Bout to hits these dirty roads and throw some mud up on my chrome
Lenny ridin' with me and we far out from the city
Yeah, we in the dirty, dirty so you know we keep it gritty
Goin' hard up on the gas like I'm tryin' to pop a wheelie
Talkin' trash about my ride, make me slap a cracker silly
