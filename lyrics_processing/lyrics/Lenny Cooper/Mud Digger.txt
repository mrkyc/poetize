Mud diggers
We keep the mud by the pound
Our tires stay roarin' while we ridin' through the town
Mud digger
And I keep a bad truck around
Big truck tall suspension 40 inches from the ground
Mud digger
And my Chevy sittin' on 44's
Pipes louder than glass packs straight pipes y'all know

If y'all don't know how the mud diggin' goes
Then get a couple of tickets to a mud boggin' show

I don't need no skill for this shit
I can be mud diggin' while I'm hittin' on your chick

People love to see me go through the worst to go
All the hard work hard work if your lazy go to work
Been in the mud five minutes and I just stained my damn shirt

Watchin' out for mud diggers in the country
