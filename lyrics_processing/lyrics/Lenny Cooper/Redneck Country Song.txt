(Baby, I swear, you're the shell in my shotgun)

Girl you're my sunshine, the good in my time
The reason I write a song, so I can put you in my rhyme
You're my feelin' good, you're my lookin' fine
You're the first taste of some fresh made apple pie
You're my sweet lady, you drive me redneck crazy
My favorite meal you make is country fried steak and gravy
I ain't gonna lie and try to make this up
But you the first girl I let drive my truck because

Baby, I swear, you're the shell in my shotgun
The first swallow of a beer when I pop one
My double wide way back in the woods
And my 4x4 when the muddin' gets good
Girl, you're my NASCAR, my college football
My best bird dog, my lucky duck call
Like Waylon and Willy, you get me singin' along
You're my redneck country song

You're my heart and soul, the one that I forever hold
You're my lucky charm, you're my pot of gold
My sunset when I'm kicked back at Charleston Beach
My favorite jam; every time you make me want to sing
I don't know what I'd do, if I didn't have you
My lips stuck on you, like they were super glued
There's somethin' 'bout that camo bikini you got on
The whole reason, yeah, you my redneck country song
You might also like
Baby, I swear, you're the shell in my shotgun
The first swallow of a beer when I pop one
My double wide way back in the woods
And my 4x4 when the muddin' gets good
Girl, you're my NASCAR, my college football
My best bird dog, my lucky duck call
Like Waylon and Willy, you get me singin' along
You're my redneck country song

Oh yeah
Girl, you turn me on like nobody I've known
When I get home and slide my favorite country station's on

Baby, I swear, you're the shell in my shotgun
The first swallow of a beer when I pop one
My double wide way back in the woods
And my 4x4 when the muddin' gets good
Girl, you're my NASCAR, my college football
My best bird dog, my lucky duck call
Like Waylon and Willy, you get me singin' along, singin' along
Like Waylon and Willy you get me singin' along
You're my redneck country song
Oh yeah, woah
You're my redneck country song
