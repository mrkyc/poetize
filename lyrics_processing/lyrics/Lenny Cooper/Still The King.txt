Y'all think that I done fell off
Hell naw still on the talk like a watch dog
Still got the power to make any call
Got the power to take any y'all
You think that I'm a sell out that I need bailed out
You bitches are gonna learn that I am the south
Five albums in you're on your first E.P
You say you need some help you better phone home E.T
Get a plan "B" 'fore you think of steppin' to the king
You a little ass puddle I'm the deep blue sea
I go all out, I ball out, you lose breath and fall out
Turn it up I'm all you wish you had my kind of spout
I got it yeah I got it, got that action I'm about it
Think you're better than the king man I highly fuckin' doubt it
Come on

I'm still the king, you suckers think I feel off
I'm still the king, you're talkin' to the backwoods boss
I'm still the king, I'm back so you better get lost
I'm still the king yeah, I'm still the king yeah
I'm still the king, all the way from the hood to the holler
I'm still the king, country boy all about a dollar
I'm still the king, I represent for the blue collar
I'm still the king yeah, I'm still the king yeah
I'm still the king

I'm king of the mud but I came to clean house
Everybody goin' country now tell me what's that all about
Have you grinded like I've grinded hell naw prolly not
I've been an outlaw ever since my first album dropped
I sat back like a big cat, watchin' all you little rats
Tryin' to act, tryin' to rap, with your fake ass country starter pack
A bonfire, your sweet tea, your Mickey T's, your Realtree's
You can mention moonshine but you could never be me
Honestly man y'all can hang it up, thought I told ya'll pack a lunch
But you didn't bring enough
Yeah I'm still the king, I'm gonna keep on diggin' ruts
Goin' balls deep got mud drippin' from my nuts
Come on

I'm still the king, you suckers think I feel off
I'm still the king, you're talkin' to the backwoods boss
I'm still the king, I'm back so you better get lost
I'm still the king yeah, I'm still the king yeah
I'm still the king, all the way from the hood to the holler
I'm still the king, country boy all about a dollar
I'm still the king, I represent for the blue collar
I'm still the king yeah, I'm still the king yeah
I'm still the king king king
King king king king
King king king king
King king king king
King king king king
I'm still the king, you suckers think I feel off
