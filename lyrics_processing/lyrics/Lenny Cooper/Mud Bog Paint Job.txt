Big truck big tires
Hit the gas slingin' mud right by ya
Drippin' wet but it ain't clean
Ridin' dirty standin' tall so mean
There's no rush, this ain't a race
A field full of trucks all over the place
This the type of stuff that will make your jaw drop
'Cause I got, I got a mud bog paint job

I'm the the line, they're wavin' me to go
I dump the clutch now I'm tearin' through a mud hole
I'm gettin' close, creepin' to the end
The crowd goes wild 'cause they see I'm 'bout to win
I made it through yeah I'm country boy stuntin'
I made it look like this muddin' ain't nothin'
Got the window down with Mud Digger pumpin'
Ladies goin' wild 'cause it's me that they wantin'
I think they like the fact that I ain't no pretty boy
'Cause I get dirty play rough with the big toys
They get wild get loud makin' big noise
While them city boys sittin' lookin' like some decoys
I keep mud packed up on my truck
When most people see it they be like "yuck"
But hey, I can get muddy all day
And still grab the mic and then hit the stage

I'm ridin' 'round town with my mud bog paint job
Pull up in the parkin' lot yeah Wal-Mart
See pretty ladies holdin' a sign sayin' car wash
So I asked how much for them to wash my truck off
They said no charge to wash my truck
Just as long as I take 'em later on to get stuck
With a smile I replied sounds good to me
Still I tip y'all a hundred each 'cause hell I ain't cheap
They gave me a wink sayin' thanks Lenny C
You're a kind country boy and you sure are sweet
I said don't worry 'bout it, it's what I do
Especially for some pretty country girls like you
They said they can't wait to see what I'm about
To ride dirt roads down deep in the south
I love gettin' dirty and rockin' to the bass
I say that we do the next car wash at my place

Who ride down south deep on them dirt roads
Slingin' up mud makin' everything a mess
Given it your best puttin' your truck to the extreme test
Mud on the inside mud on the outside

Mud on the cooler gettin' all over the beer
Hell we don't give a damn that's how we do it down here
Flip flop paint job lookin' like some camouflage
Real Tree Mossy Oak for real no joke
Gettin' real crunk covered up with the mud clumps
Roots hangin' off the side lookin' like a tree stump
Country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
Some good ol' folks don't mean no harm
Can you tell where the ground and my truck starts and stops
