Chasin' them dreams, makin' them hits
From an old back road to down in the sticks
Work hard for a dollar, with no regrets
That's just who I am, yeah the fam' been blessed
Chillin' in the backwoods
Livin' life how I should
And you know it's all good
Chillin', chillin' in the backwoods

I had all the intentions and visions of me makin' a million
Relax, kick back no worries or two shits is given
But I was wrong (I was wrong)
This here is hard work (Work)
Torn shirt, back hurt, blisters 'bout to burst
I keep movin' forward
With life that has no rebirth, no reverse
Mo script, no stage, not a damn thing that was rehearsed
Late nights, bar fights, and early mornin' headaches
Advil, orange juice, and complementary pancakes
On an old back road where I be makin' my hits
Knockin' all these wannabe CMT's up off the list
Dirty dirty ya heard me, from Cali to Jersey
Stay thirsty, prove I'm worthy, stack them paper on ya

Chasin' them dreams, makin' them hits
From an old back road to down in the sticks
Work hard for a dollar, with no regrets
That's just who I am, yeah the fam' been blessed
Chillin' in the backwoods
Livin' life how I should
And you know it's all good
Chillin', chillin' in the backwoods

I've been around for quite some time
Business man, I am the mind
Chasin' dreams, everything I got
You damn right I put it on the line
Failure ain't an option, put it all on the table
It's me, my wife, my kids and our future's lookin' stable
Blessed, yeah I'm grateful for this label
Know I'm able put some butter on this bagel
Even sit back, watch some cable
Need a change up in this game
So I came and added flavor
They be hatin' 'cause I'm greater
I wave bye bye to them haters
Up early in the mornin', to late in the evenin'
Been grindin' 'til I'm bleedin'
While you other steady sleepin'
Reapin' what you sow, I'm bearin' the load, lets' roll
Country music inspires the soul
Chasin' them dreams, makin' them hits
From an old back road to down in the sticks
Work hard for a dollar, with no regrets
That's just who I am, yeah the fam' been blessed
Chillin' in the backwoods
Livin' life how I should
And you know it's all good
Chillin', chillin' in the backwoods

Dirtified, in the sticks
I'm a backwoods baller
Work hard for my dollar
Poppin' them camo collars
I'm callin' the shots, lock, cock
Put a bullseye on the top ain't gonna stop
Nah

Chasin' them dreams, makin' them hits
From an old back road to down in the sticks
Work hard for a dollar, with no regrets
That's just who I am, yeah the fam' been blessed
Chillin' in the backwoods
Livin' life how I should
And you know it's all good
