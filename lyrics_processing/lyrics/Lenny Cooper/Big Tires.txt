Oh my God, look at them tires (Big tires)
They are so big (Big, big) (Big tires)

I got some big tires, 54's comin' down the road (Big tires)
I got the hammer down hear my truck roarin'
Tires so loud, people sayin' good Lord (Big tires)
I know you can hear me from miles away
In a mud hole is where I stay (Big tires)
Come and play but some things are required
'Cause you gotta have a big truck and big tires

Lookout it's the monster truck
Revvin' up, they get the crowd pumped
These big tires gettin' caked up
Pullin' off the line makin' deep ruts
We take it serious, this ain't a game
These trucks gone wild, man it's insane
Stacks through the hood, blowin' flames
Slingin' rooster tails as high as air planes
We gettin' loose, we're a crazy gang
Trucks lined up like a crazy train
This is what we do, there ain't no stoppin' us
Drivin' over cars in our big trucks
It's now or never the sky's the limit
Jack them up is how we livin'
If you don't feel it then you wanna ask why
Just something about a big truck and big tires

Call up Rocky Ridge, tell him I need me a monster lift
For my Super Swampers yeah they boggers
Tearin' up the woods just like a logger
I'm climbin' rocks, straight up to the top
I'll make you so scared you jump out your socks
I'm always ready, it's balls to the wall
Sometimes there's slips and close calls
But it's fun and that's what it's all about
Mud bogs and wylin' out
Ridin' down the dirt roads to find the spot
Switchin' gears and bein' fully locked
It's what it is and what I desire
My Chevrolet can do a all nighter
Yeah, it's big truck (Damn right)
With what? (You know) Big tires
I got some big tires, 54's comin' down the road (Big tires)
I got the hammer down hear my truck roarin'
Tires so loud, people sayin' good Lord (Big tires)

Come and play but some things are required
'Cause you gotta have a big truck and big tires

Big tires comin' down the road
I'm on the way to a truck show
Now I'm on the scene and all eyes on me
Big tires on the truck that's real clean
I'm big time country stuntin'
Yeah I'm bumpin', let me tell you somethin'
This pretty ass blonde, walks on up and says
"Excuse me but can I ride in your truck?"
I said "Hell yeah girl, climb on up"
Now it's time to ride, it's party time
We ridin' high, it's southern pride
A great time to shine and you to be mine
With white tees with mud stains, raisin' hell
Doin' our thing, so drop your chain and hook it on up
To my big truck, with big tires
I got some big tires, 54's comin' down the road (Big tires)
I got the hammer down hear my truck roarin'
Tires so loud, people sayin' good Lord (Big tires)
I know you can hear me from miles away
In a mud hole is where I stay (Big tires)
Come and play but some things are required
'Cause you gotta have a big truck and big tires
Big tires
Big tires
