This road I'm travelin' on it won't be long until I make it
They say to each his own, I'm tired of wingin' and I'ma take it
So how would they remember me?
I leave my legacy

Pack my bags then hit the road for another show
Hugs and kisses for my little girls, they my whole world
I always let 'em know, yeah I let 'em know
Tell my wife that I love her and say thanks for the great supper
That I just can not wait to get back home, get back home
B-b-b-been gone so long another night away from home
Ain't no doubt seen ups and downs, on the interstate I roam (I roam)
I'm a rollin' stone It's all I know, Usian Bolt and I'm goin' for gold
Bust the threshold let's go, I won' get stuck on this plateau

Legacy what I leave behind
Part of me that was thinkin' in mind
My life through these lines
The eyes of a small town outcast built to shine
And I'ma outlast most
I sold it all for hope, yeah I went for broke
This is all she wrote, ayy
Line in, line out this is my heart and my soul
But the fame is the pen and the blood is the flow
Long nights, even missin' birthdays
Cryin' in my soul, daddy loves you dearly
I do this for you and me the family
Anything to see you live happily
And when I'm gone will you remember me
A lovin' dad who loved endlessly
An honest man, respect, honor, work
Family first, before ridin' in that hearse

Work-work long, play hard
Gonna win hands don't need good cards
It's all how you play
Push to finish when you wanna fade, hey
Right past frustration
Dusk 'til dawn without hesitation
Yeah, I'll stack it up
And bankroll three generations
It's been a long week gone, I miss my son's laugh
You don't know how hard it is to be a good dad
I put in hard work, but I ain't thinkin' 'bout it
'Cause I know my family wouldn't be here without it
Tryna leave he 400 acres to my grandkids
Leave 'em proud of what they old man did
They think I'm genius, yup, I planned it
Left a wheel in the closet on a ScanDisk

This road I'm travelin' on it won't be long until I make it
They say to each his own, I'm tired of wingin', I'ma take it
So how would they remember me?
