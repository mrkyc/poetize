'Cause I got dirt under my nails and all of my clothes (All of my clothes)
Dirty windshield, doin' dirt all I know (That's all I know)
Dirty mud tires ride 'til I'm lost
Got some dirt on my shoulders ain't gon' brush it off
Dirt under my nails and all of my clothes (All of my clothes)
Dirty windshield, doin' dirt all I know (That's all I know)
Dirty mud tires ride 'til I'm lost
Got some dirt on my shoulders ain't gon' brush it off

I'm livin' the dirty life, I'm Dirtified
I've been diggin' ditches with them big tires for a long while
I'm Lenny C and I see you with them wenches
But they ain't for me I guarantee that I'm steady shiftin'
If I'm in the mud if not I'm out buildin' fences
In the summer sun with the sweat soaked britches
Sippin' sweet tea that was made by my Mrs
And when I'm done I'm eatin' steak to go along with the fixins
Yeah it's a dirty thing, and I understand if you don't understand
I won't change, I'm a product of my home and it can't be beat
Dirty boy keeps dirt from his head to his feet

'Cause I got dirt under my nails and all of my clothes (All of my clothes)
Dirty windshield, doin' dirt all I know (That's all I know)
Dirty mud tires ride 'til I'm lost
Got some dirt on my shoulders ain't gon' brush it off
Dirt under my nails and all of my clothes (All of my clothes)
Dirty windshield, doin' dirt all I know (That's all I know)
Dirty mud tires ride 'til I'm lost
Got some dirt on my shoulders ain't gon' brush it off

My boots so dirty they got roots growin' on 'em
In the booth goin' on about the truth
Knowin' only I can do what I do, so I do what I do
Chevy truck chain weighin' more than a moose
I refuse to lose, so I work my ass off
Pay my dues 'til my dues paid off
Now I'm dirtier than ever, grabbin' that lever
Time to dump a dump truck full of Carolina mud on every record
Hell yeah I'm boggin'
I'm the king of this thing but don't think I'm a one trick pony
I'm livin' out a dream, stackin' that green
And all these clean boys 'round here wanna clone me

'Cause I got dirt under my nails and all of my clothes (All of my clothes)
Dirty windshield, doin' dirt all I know (That's all I know)
Dirty mud tires ride 'til I'm lost
Got some dirt on my shoulders ain't gon' brush it off
Dirt under my nails and all of my clothes (All of my clothes)
Dirty windshield, doin' dirt all I know (That's all I know)
Dirty mud tires ride 'til I'm lost
