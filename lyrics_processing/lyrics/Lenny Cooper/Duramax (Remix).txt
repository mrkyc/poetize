Blacked out Duramax speakers 'bout to bust (Bust)
Moonlight bright, sh-shinin' off the dust
Se-se-se-seat leaned back ridin' way jacked up
Yeah, I love this way of life, I can never get enough

 &  of Moonshine Bandits]
I'm a back road boss 37 on the knobs
You can see my exhaust and the slobber from my dog
(Blacked out Duramax) slappin' in the mud
The bed liner full of blondes bouncin' to the subs
Blacked out bowtie lift kit so high
Laughin' at the stock boys every time I roll by
Stock boy stock boy get 'er in the shop
I'ma rock boy, rock boy, hear my speakers knock
Still sippin' on the mash got the flat bill on the dash
The kickers bangin' Cash throwin' gravel at your ass
Burnout on your lawn, toss a bottle then I'm gone
Drop the hammer down on them full throttle to this song
Every single shade of camouflage on the seat
Mud sprayin' in your face if you're ridin' next to me
Muddered out paint job mud drip chrome (Chrome)
Rider her hard, get her wet, then bring her back home (Back home)

I've got a blacked out Duramax
A 12 inch smoke stack four 12's in the back
Poundin' hard like a whack-a-pack
All the girls wanna ride six of 'em in the back
With the camo dash nah, they can't get enough of that
Yeah, I love this way of life, I-I can never get enough
Young Gunner on the radio (You know my truck is jacked up)
Carolina, Georgia, Florida I will always represent it
Rockin' mud blood if you ain't seen it then you gotta get it
Love the way my Chevrolet compliments my Chevy chain
Mud Digger King and at the top is where I still remain
Good ole country boys somethin' bought me that'll never change
You'll never get on my level as long as I'm up in this game

I got that Duramax power rollin' coal out by the hour
And I keep these yuppies sour 'cause I'm taller than a tower
If you pull up right beside me make you tuck your head and cower
I'ma rain on your parade and blow some smoke out on your flowers
Yeah, I'm peelin' off and grinnin' with a Chevy full of women
Leave you in a cloud of smoke with my tires spinnin'
I'm gone, jammin' hick-hop in my zone
'Bout to hits these dirty roads
And throw some mud up on my chrome
Lenny ridin' with me and we far out from the city
Yeah, we in the dirty, dirty so you know we keep it gritty
Goin' hard up on the gas like I'm tryin' to pop a wheelie
Talkin' trash about my ride make me slap a cracker silly
