I got a truck that don't stop, a house in the sticks
Work hard for what I own and I ain't never gonna quit
I live a low budget lifestyle I eat what I kill
Do you do the do the same thing
'Cause I ain't ashamed to admit that
I'm a redneck I get it how I get it
No doubt that I'm about my country livin'
I'm a redneck, I get it how I get it
Chillin' while I'm grillin' and a beer I'm steady sippin'

I got no worries for the day, I put my problems all away
Work is over for the week, and now it's time to play
Pull my cell phone out, text them party at my house
Then before you even know it I got people all around
The ladies lookin' lovely, they ready to get all muddy
Drivin' Chevrolet, hittin' mudholes I have made
I can't believe my eyes, it's a blessin' in disguise
Ladies drivin' big trucks with big tires
All my bros all know that this the hot spot
Two one one for the weekend with the tailgate dropped
I'm a top notch, you know I got this country game on lock
I'm a beast of a king like a Chevy big block
My salute goes out for people fightin' for us
'Cause while we havin' good times there's people dyin' for us
I thank God everyday I must admit I'm blessed to say that I'm an
R-E-D-N-E-C-K and I live it the southern way

No doubt that I'm about my country livin'
I'm a redneck, I get it how I get it
Chillin' while I'm grillin' and a beer I'm steady sippin'

Now I know that everyone likes to have a dream about doin' big things
With a pocket full of green and I ain't talkin' no dro
I'm talkin' payin' as you go
With no worries with the money, make it rain up in the country
Buy a big old house that cost a couple hundred grand
With a couple hundred acres just to say I got some land
I build a big old pond, the biggest I can get
And say the hell with the river I got my own lake to fish
And have a driveway that looks like a car lot
And be proud to say that I own everything I got
And all that success was from my album sellin'
Would be the reason I'm doin' things, 'cause my bank account swellin'
But in reality, that really ain't my lifestyle
It's just a dream of me doin' big things
And I'll always stay country 'til my very last breath
'Cause I'm an R-E-D-N-E-C-K, that's right a redneck
I got a truck that don't stop, a house in the sticks
Work hard for what I own and I ain't never gonna quit
I live a low budget lifestyle I eat what I kill
Do you do the do the same thing
'Cause I ain't ashamed to admit that
I'm a redneck I get it how I get it
No doubt that I'm about my country livin'
I'm a redneck, I get it how I get it
Chillin' while I'm grillin' and a beer I'm steady sippin'
