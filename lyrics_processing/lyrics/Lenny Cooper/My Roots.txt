Tall grass where them roosters crow
Clothes hangin' on a line
Southern heat, barbecue mesquite
Granny's fresh made apple pie
I'm backwoods chillin' country life livin'
Yeah I'm satisfied
Wanna find me, know where I'll be
'Cause my roots stay dirtified, dirtified

Welcome to the South, dirtified what I'm 'bout
You say you in a drought, come on bring it to the house
I got beers for days, moonshine by case
Girls blowin' up my phone sayin' they on the way, hey
You think you know how my life goes
You ain't seen shit
I'm just showin' y'all the intro, for real though
My life up and down a dirt road
Sometimes for little bits, I walk for them curves though
I got a fuel lined up with them black crows
Speakin' Chinese if you talkin' about the metro
The woods yo, that's my kind of tempo
Duramax, two stacks blowin' out that black smoke

Tall grass where them roosters crow
Clothes hangin' on a line
Southern heat, barbecue mesquite
Granny's fresh made apple pie
I'm backwoods chillin' country life livin'
Yeah I'm satisfied
Wanna find me, know where I'll be
'Cause my roots stay dirtified, dirtified

Uh, been workin' on a come up
Seven years and ya still can't stomach
The country love it, haters they can shove it
Man forget the press, I'm gonna bring it to the public
They altercatin', there's no debatin'
My mind is made, made from dirt, now this dirt is how I get paid
I chop it up, you can go ahead and call me Sling Blade
Heavyweight, I'm dirtified taking over every state
I'm Houdini, I make the mud levitate
Take these rhymes right here, let that shit marinate
Southern made from these backwoods
Home grown, mind blown
Ride around in that jacked up two tone

Tall grass where them roosters crow
Clothes hangin' on a line
Southern heat, barbecue mesquite
Granny's fresh made apple pie
I'm backwoods chillin' country life livin'
Yeah I'm satisfied
Wanna find me, know where I'll be
'Cause my roots stay dirtified, dirtified

Let me ask you something
You dirtified?
I'm dirtified
We dirtfied
Tall grass where them roosters crow
Clothes hangin' on a line
Southern heat, barbecue mesquite
Granny's fresh made apple pie
I'm backwoods chillin' country life livin'
Yeah I'm satisfied
Wanna find me, know where I'll be
