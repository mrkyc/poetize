We holla hell yeah
Put the radio on blast
Got the speakers rockin' Willie and Waylon and Johnny Cash
Holla hell yeah
Sippin' apple pie got the coolers filled up with nothin' but Bud Light
Holla hell yeah
We got the trucks that sit high when we get to feelin' right we ride off into the night

We holla hell yeah, we like the party loud
Rebels of the south throwin' down in a small town
We keep it rockin' non stop and got the system throttled
Drop the tailgate and watch the beer start a poppin'
Girls dancin' on a pole in the back of the truck
With the Solo cups drinks up no edit
Everything uncut take notes and I'll show you how to stunt
Leader of the south yeah I'm king of the cut

We holla hell yeah
Put the radio on blast
Got the speakers rockin' Willie and Waylon and Johnny Cash

Give me that F350 keep your Bentley
Redneck boys make noise if you're with me
Dixie dimes tootin' in high heal boots
And that bootie stick out like a shotgun shoots
Double barrel Winchester sawed off
Tossed in the back of the jacked up and hauled off
I got my straw hat tied on tight
And my shades in case the bonfire burns too bright
