We keep it so country, you probably hate it (Hey)
We ridin' so high, you might think we're crazy (Yeah)
Moonshine sippin', trucks are so lifted
You go against us, you better come with it
See us ridin' high, (High) got ya like woah (Woah)
Truck jacked up with the beer ice cold (Cold)
Yeah we rollin' coal, (Coal) our tires lookin' swole (Swole)
Creep up to the hole, then it's time to lock and load (Load)

Pure country to my last breath
Yeah you know I keep it fresh
Chevrolet knows how to flex
I make them turn heads til' they breakin' necks
I'm turned up, no turn down
All smiles, no frowns
Mud Digger, this the king here
You know me, I hold it down
I run these woods, I run this town
Never try me, you better back down
Check the status, check my background
I'm Mr. Duramax, blowin' black clouds
Keep it 100, comin' straight from the jar
I'm on fire call me methanol
Me and Young Gunner, we ride tall
You need them rednecks, we them ones to call
Overall, we know how to ball
Lock them hubs, we know how to crawl
12 point buck, 300 jars
Pull the trigger and watch 'em fall
Yeah that's right I'm a redneck dude
Battle-tested, tried and true
With a MDM, yeah that's my crew
Givin' back to people, that's what we do

When it's time to hit the hole, man we turn up
Smoke got us lookin' like we burned up
Shit gets real, we lock them hubs
Turn up the bass like we in the club
Buddy ridin' with me, like grab me a beer
But I re-re-really want to taste the clear
So I'm turnin' up jars while switching gears
You can call me a pro, I've been on it for years
That-that's right, been sippin' on shine
With a trunk-bend full of some fine wine-dine
Playin' in the mud way back in the pines
Have a little fun while we waste some time
With a 808 thumpin', rednecks jumpin'
Get real crunk, turn nothin' into somethin'
Ain't nothin' better than a good time muddin'
Truck like a train, just chug-a-luggin'
Come on out, where the rednecks drunk
Sling up some mud and get real crunk
Need to make some jars on the old tree stump
You know we keep it country like Bubba Gump
Yeah that's right, I'm a redneck dude
Comin' through town with my truck lookin' new
With a red cartel, yeah that's my crew
Raise hell, sling mud, that's what we do
We keep it so country, you probably hate it (Hey)
