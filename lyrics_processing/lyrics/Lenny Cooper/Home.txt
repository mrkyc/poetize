Right now it's only stage lights and them late nights
A lot of time with nothin' but you on my mind
I know I'm barely at home and it's hard on us
Just the thought of you bein' alone makes it more tough
But it lightens me up to know that I have a good girl
One who's there for me and completes my whole world
Who loves what I do, supports my music
When I want to throw the towel in she says
"Baby, you can do this"
She has so much faith on what I can create
She says, "Let the haters hate, who gives a damn what they think" So I keep my head up, keep my life clean
Work hard as I can so we can live our dream
This kind of lifestyle is different, and everything is changin'
A roller coaster that rides fast, and a little crazy
But I promise baby, I won't be gone for long
Because before you know it, hell, I'll be comin' back home

Yeah, here I am goin' down this long road
Different night, different place doin' a show
I'm thinkin' of you and I just want you to know
I won't be gone for long, I'll be comin' back home
I'll be comin' back home

When we first met we were takin' pictures in stormy weather
Never woulda thought we would have a chance to be together
Look at us now, we just happy as ever
Never woulda thought my life could get any better
Until I met you, I never knew love was true
'Til cupid shot me up, now my heart is filled with you
With us in love havin' fun on them late nights
Walkin' on a train trestle kissin' in the moonlight
Holdin' hands, walkin' in the waves and sand
It was the first time I said, "I love you" and that's when our future began
Time moves on, we bout to have a family
And I'm a proud dad knowin' you gonna have my baby
Wouldn't want it any other way
If I never met you then my life would be in a haze
I can't explain but I'm in a love zone
In your heart is where I want to be and where I call home
You might also like
Yeah, here I am goin' down this long road
Different night, different place doin' a show
I'm thinkin' of you and I just want you to know
I won't be gone for long, I'll be comin' back home
I'll be comin' back home

Right now I'm sittin' here on this tour bus
Flippin' through the photobook
And I'm seein you and our baby girl
And I'm tellin' you right now I miss home
Bein' on the road is fun and all
But ain't as fun, without you and my little baby girl
I just wanna let you know
I love both y'all from the bottom of my heart
And I will be comin' back home

Yeah, here I am goin' down this long road
Different night, different place doin' a show
I'm thinkin' of you and I just want you to know
I won't be gone for long, I'll be comin' back home
I'll be comin' back home
I won't be gone for long, I'll be comin' back home
