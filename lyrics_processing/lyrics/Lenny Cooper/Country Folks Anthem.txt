Livin' the simple life, three-sixty-five
A jacked-up truck and buckshot tires
A cold Bud Light and a big bonfire
We just drink and smoke and then tell the lies
Tell the lies, tell the lies
You better tell them guys, tell them guys
As long as I'm alive
We live in a country folks anthem

I'm country to the bone, southern to the soul
And I'm proud of my home 'cause it's dirt road
I'm topped alright, big tall, if you can't find me in town
Then you can catch me at a mud bog
Damn right, son, that's just how it is
It's grillin' deer meat and fryin' up some fish
Around here's dirt road and some mud holes
Plenty of places to put your truck in four low
And on the weekends, we build them bonfires
With them trucks gathered 'round, sittin' on some big tires
Passin' out moonshine, havin' us a good time
No worries in the world, everything's just fine
And that's the joy of livin' in the south
There's a one way in and a one way out route
Lenny Cooper and Charlie Farley on this anthem song
If you know the words, come on, sing along

Livin' the simple life, three-sixty-five
A jacked-up truck and buckshot tires
A cold Bud Light and a big bonfire
We just drink and smoke and then tell the lies
Tell the lies, tell the lies
You better tell them guys, tell them guys
As long as I'm alive
We live in a country folks anthem

Charlie Farley hooked up with Lenny Cooper
He threw me in the truck as tough as Lex Luger
It was loud as a Ruger, no, I didn't look down
No tellin' what that altitude'll do to ya
I've been in tune with this life since I was a junior
In Junior High barely able to drive
And out where the headlights will go out of sight underwater
We be on the CB like, "Bring the chain"
I got forty-seven big, same amount of dogs
Fifty leather skins and a couple of hogs
I build a turkey bin, raise 'em 'til I kill 'em all
Just to feed my kids up this country where I live, yo
Run 'em out of sight and so I'm out of mind
'Til I get on the mic, that's when I lose my mind
I talk about our life and how we get down
Down here by speakin' that country folk sayin' code, come on
Livin' the simple life, three-sixty-five
A jacked-up truck and buckshot tires
A cold Bud Light and a big bonfire
We just drink and smoke and then tell the lies
Tell the lies, tell the lies
You better tell them guys, tell them guys
As long as I'm alive
We live in a country folks anthem

Uh, dirty clothes, mud holes
A can of Skoal and a dirt road (Now that's country)
Forty-fours and holes in a screen door
And sweet tea by the boatload (Yeah, that's country)
Four folks and it's good as gold
Wanna have you a time, we'll put on a show
But you better take you some NoDoz ('Doz)
We ain't leavin' 'til the gates close (Close)

Livin' the simple life, three-sixty-five
A jacked-up truck and buckshot tires
A cold Bud Light and a big bonfire
We just drink and smoke and then tell the lies
Tell the lies, tell the lies
You better tell them guys, tell them guys
As long as I'm alive
