In the back of the truck she takin' full control
Round and round, up and down, she make them hips roll (Roll)
She likes it fast but she loves it slow
This country girl ride the pole like a rodeo

I'm ready for the night to begin (Hell yeah)
Hop in the truck, put a sixty in the wind
There's a field party tonight
And you already know that the cooler filled Bud Light
Big ties and I'm ridin' real tough
Girls textin' me, time to reel 'em up
Don't know which one to pick
All I know is I need to make my mind up quick
Got my swag on full and I pulled up fresh
Said these girls wanna get a piece of this redneck (Come on)
This girl walked by and caught my eye
She workin' them sexy thighs
She waved me over with a smile
Took my hand and said, "It's time to go" (Giddy up)
Threw me in the back of the truck and rode me like a rodeo

In the back of the truck she takin' full control
Round and round, up and down, she make them hips roll (Roll)
She likes it fast but she loves it slow
This country girl ride the pole like a rodeo

She ride the pole, that's good as gold
She got my pimp, damn right she's sold
See that fly guy and you know it's me
Every day every week we repeat
I love it when she back it up
I got me a bullseye free tatted up
Shake it like a saltshaker, freak-a-leak
She bend over and touch her feet
So flexible, it's amazing, this girl right here ain't lazy (Nope)
So many things that I wanna do, so let's get drunk and act crazy (Crazy)
Up and down, side to side, round and round, she love to ride (Giddy up)
Tie me up, take this pole, and ride me like a rodeo

In the back of the truck she takin' full control
Round and round, up and down, she make them hips roll (Roll)
She likes it fast but she loves it slow
This country girl ride the pole like a rodeo

I-i-in the back of the truck, tr-tr-truck
She make them hips roll, she make them hips roll
She likes it fast, fast but she loves it slow, slow
This country girl ride the pole like a rodeo
In the back of the truck she takin' full control
Round and round, up and down, she make them hips roll (Roll)
She likes it fast but she loves it slow
This country girl ride the pole like a rodeo
