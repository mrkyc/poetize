Sit tight, I'm going to need you to keep time
Come on, just snap, snap, snap your fingers for me
Good, good, now we're making some progress
Come on, just tap, tap, tap your toes to the beat

And I believe
This may call for a proper introduction, and, well
Don't you see?
I'm the narrator, and this is just the prologue

Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, but desperate for attention
I aim to be
Your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives
Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, but desperate for attention
I aim to be
Your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives

Applause! Applause! No, wait, wait...
Dear studio audience, I've an announcement to make
It seems the artists these days are not who you think
So we'll pick back up on that on another page

And I believe
This may call for a proper introduction, and, well
Don't you see?
I'm the narrator and this is just the prologue

Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, but desperate for attention
I aim to be
Your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives
Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, but desperate for attention
I aim to be
Your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives

Swear to shake it up, you swear to listen
Swear to shake it up, you swear to listen
Swear to shake it up, you swear to listen
Swear to shake it up, swear to shake it up

Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, but desperate for attention
I aim to be
Your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives
Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, but desperate for attention
I aim to be your eyes
