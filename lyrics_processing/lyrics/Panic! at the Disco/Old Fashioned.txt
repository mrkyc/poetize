Once upon a thrill, from a kiss to a swill
We were swallowin' the nights like we had nine lives
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so
We were borderline kids with a book of disorders
Medicatin' every day to keep the straightness in order
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone

It's the false side of hope where believers concede
And there's only memories when it's over

So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

Once upon before, we were brilliant and bored
Two dashes of the bitters, add some ice and you pour
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
You might also like
It's the false side of hope where believers concede
And there's only memories when it's over

So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

Get boozy, boozy, boozy (Now it looks like a wasteland)
Get boozy, boozy, boozy (Not the way that we remember)
Get boozy, boozy, boozy (One more sip for the past)
Get boozy, boozy, boozy (And always tip your bartenders)
Get boozy, boozy, boozy, Get boozy, boozy, boozy
Get boozy, boozy, boozy, Get boo-

So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
