Had my suitcase packed for a trip to Hell
When the Lord played a song on an old church bell
The Devil just stood there tapping his toes
Singing hurry up girl we gotta go

Did you pack your evil ways
And all your wilder days
You spent your money on saving your sins
There's a checkered little past I kept 'em all in
And when your interest multiplies
Everything good in you dies
But I never knew a God but the One on high
Never had a picture of Jesus Christ
Only thing I ever really took in vain was a Sunday drive in the restful rain
Honored Momma's words and Daddy's hands
Never hurt anybody, never wore a wedding band
Might've stole a kiss, but I never told a lie
And all I ever wanted was a real good time

Song he played was a hymn I'd heard
From the backsider pew in a Nazarene church
When that Devil was a ready to go
I said one minute boy don't you know
You might also like
I packed my evil ways
Underneath my wilder days
And I spent my money on saving my sins
There's a checkered little past you kept 'em all in
But when my interest multiplies
Well I live myself one hell of a lie
And I never knew a God but the One on high
Never had a picture of Jesus Christ
Only thing I ever really took in vain was a Sunday drive in the restful rain
Honored Momma's words and Daddy's hands
Never hurt anybody, never wore a wedding band
Might've stole a kiss, but I never told a lie
And all I ever wanted was a real good time hmmm hmmm

And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those
Things which were told her from the Lord
And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation

No preacher man ever rang clear as the bells
