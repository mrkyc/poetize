When you kissed me the other night
It was my first taste of wine
When I woke up the next morning
You were still on my mind
There's a bittersweet flavor on my tongue
You haven't called me, so honey I'm done
Ain't gonna hang around and wait
For you to break my heart

You can't get a good girl down
You can't get a good girl down
She got no secrets and she got no lies
She'll burn you out with the truth in her eyes
She's standin' on solid ground
You can't get a good girl down

I'm not just a pretty face
Not a flower in a vase
It's a man's world, and I'm a lady
And they'll never appreciate me
They don't take the time to get to know who I am
Frankly, boys, I don't give a damn
I got my head on straight
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, no no no
You might also like
You can't get a good girl down
You can't get a good girl down
She got no secrets and she got no lies
She'll burn you out with the truth in her eyes
She's standin' on solid ground
You can't get a good girl down

Not gonna sit around, not gonna cry
Won't be no tears fallin' from these eyes
Put on my makeup, do up my hair
Gonna walk tall and let 'em all stare

You can't get a good girl down
You can't get a good girl down
She got no secrets and she got no lies
She'll burn you out with the truth in her eyes
She's standin' on solid ground
You can't get a good girl down
You can't get a good girl down
You can't get a good girl down
She got no secrets and she got no lies
She'll burn you out with the truth in her eyes
She's standin' on solid ground
