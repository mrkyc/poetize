We've got nothing else to do
Except have bad intentions and what history tells us to
I think it's time to finally cash that check..
Let's get wrecked, oh let's get wrecked
All these folks around us say go get it while you're young
Climbing heaven's ladder you can skip a couple rungs
I think it's time that all our dues got paid...
Let's get laid, c'mon let's get laid
Chorus
I black out the windows and he boards up the door
I'm wound up with thinking and he sleeps on the floor
He kisses like a masochist and I'm better off alone
Being in love is harder than I ever could have known
We're shacked up in Nashville and the sky is coming down
Kids back in the back yard are burning that sweet cloud
I think it's time to default on that loan
Let's get stoned, c'mon let's get stoned
Pulling at our jeans now honey and biting at our necks
Shouting both our names out trying hard not to forget
We hit it out the park on our first pitch
Let's get hitched, oh let's hitched

I black out the windows and he boards up the door
I'm wound up with thinking and he sleeps on the floor
He kisses like a masochist and I'm better off alone
Grown up love is harder than I ever could have known, oh grown up love is harder than I ever could have known
We keep digging deeper
Sending someone else the bill
Crying to our mamas when we can't climb up the hill
Pushing panic way down deep inside
We got pride, Oh we got pride
Chorus
I black out the windows and he boards up the door
I'm wound up with thinking and he sleeps on the floor
He kisses like a masochist and I'm better off alone
Real love is harder than I ever could have known
