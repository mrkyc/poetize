I ain't the one didn't love you enough
I'm just sittin' in my own front yard
Wishin' the rain didn't fall so hard
And you got twisted, you got stuck
Enlisted in your own bad luck
Tried your best to be the worst
You must like it that you're cursed
And don't think it won't come back to you
Bad people don't come from nothing at all
Bad people don't come from nothing at all
Crash and a bang and a burn and a fall
Bad people don't come from nothing at all
Jimmy was a broken boy, single ma out of Illinois
Bred like a pitbull, lookin' for a fight
Cracked on his nose, he was bloody all his life
Got a loneliness like an epidemic
Now he cashed his check and he won't regret it
Ain't no lovers left or friend
Self defined as a dead end
And don't think he ain't a part of you

Bad people don't come from nothing at all
Crash and a bang and a burn and a fall
Bad people don't come from nothing at all
Ooh baby, tell me what you need
Come on and lay it on me
I don't care what you believe
We all got some darkness up our sleeves
Yeah, we all got some darkness up our sleeve
Some pull us down and some pull us through
Baby it's a toss up how you do
Maybe someone decides for you
Maybe you don't even get to choose
And I
I don't
Know
What's best for you
Bad people don't come from nothing at all
Bad people don't come from nothing at all
Crash and a bang and a burn and a fall
Bad people don't come from nothing at all
Bad people
Don't come from nothing at all
