I am redesigning the mind of the masses
That fear a Black man with tattoos and bandanas
But when a white man wear tattoos and bandanas
And joins a bike gang, it's all cool, where's the balance?
Hate my Black flesh, bet you're mad that I came up
You cannot change, rearrange my chemical makeup
Pigmentation
Annunaki blood, who just wanted to make ya
Astral project, plug out of the matrix
You fake fucks plagiarists
I make a whore drop drugs with my cranium, telepathy
Host with the most, you can't find a better beast
Better off dead, I sever off heads
Ever since I blew up, niggas think I got bread
Since they got their hands out, they gone get their palms read
Red from all that bloodshed

Load it up, my nigga, bang, bang
Cook that rock, nigga, slang 'caine
Point your finger, play the blame game
Fuck it, dog, it's the American way
Get high, my nigga, maintain
Tell lies, chase fame
'Cause if they could, they would still hang
Trust me, dog, it's the American way
You might also like
It's the American way
It's the American way
I can't forget them three K's
It's the American way

Music my own drug, distributed through the people
Niggas will never change unless you thinkin' you need to
We were built to destroy, home of the unemployed
We callin' it rap while you callin' it noise
So evacuate your homes
Radios never play my favorite song
Miss America would never be Black, no use in tellin' me that
Everybody could coincide, it could never be that
Good riddance to the realest, but you gotta feel us
Gettin' cash every day, twistin' flame, hurtin' feelings
Stereotype, never marry a wife
Another block nigga making music, maybe you right
Most definitely and you questioning me
If the world fucked up, the exception is me
The government love guns 'til they aimed at you
Ain't no tellin' what I might do for the red, white, and the blue

Load it up, my nigga, bang, bang
Cook that rock, nigga, slang 'caine
Point your finger, play the blame game
Fuck it, dog, it's the American way
Get high, my nigga, maintain
Tell lies, chase fame
'Cause if they could, they would still hang
Trust me, dog, it's the American way
Oh shit, oh Lord
Here we go again, finna get these packs off
Repetitive sedative, got a fetish for fetishes
An American menace, I'm manifesting my businesses
Realest as realest gets, terror to terrorists
If you put your hands out, I'ma crush your fingertips
Fuck Bloomberg, that man absurd
Throw him in the trunk, ah, right up on the curb
Hop out, mash out, leave his ass there
Niggas talk shit, but I don't fear words
Better off dead, prepare for the worse
Been slaved since my first damn days on this earth
Fuck social security
And fuck homeland security
9/11 biggest fraud in history
And all you rappers ain't goddamn shit to me
Getting fucked by your label
Fame-chasing, bitch-chasing, lonely-ass nigga, probably snitch, you ain't gon' face it
In debt to the red, white, and blue
Your government lies, so who the fuck is you?

Load it up, my nigga, bang, bang
Cook that rock, nigga, slang 'caine
Point your finger, play the blame game
Fuck it, dog, it's the American way
Get high, my nigga, maintain
Tell lies, chase fame
'Cause if they could, they would still hang
Trust me, dog, it's the American way
It's the American way
It's the American way
