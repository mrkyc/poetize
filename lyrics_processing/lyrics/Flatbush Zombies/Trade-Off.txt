It's that work hard, play hard
Make you quit that day job
I smoked so much this year, we couldn't even take a day off
I plan to take a trip
Want the money how it's spent
I just re-up
Plus I just paid my phone and the rent

Hey, it's lit
Call my partners up, we goin' up, you slowin' up
I never judge, we do indulge
In truth, I never touch the stuff
One puff of that fluffy stuff, shit hit me like a sucker punch
Side effects include mass paranoia plus the cotton mouth
Down another bottle with my niggas
Before this was a movie, we pictured us livin' bitter
And I forgive 'em, whatever, whatever
Tellin' me different, nothin' is given
Without sacrifices, somethin' is close to niggas to chill with
Pray for the children
The government spikin' penicillin
And Lord willin'
We all live to be twenty million
Outcome infinite dawg, where is the ceilin'?
'Cause five years ago we came to be without disappearin'

It's that work hard, play hard
Make you quit that day job
I smoked so much this year, we couldn't even take a day off
I plan to take a trip
Want the money how it's spent
I just re-up
Plus I just paid my phone and the rent
It's that work hard, play hard
I just got a blow job
Smoke so much this year, we couldn't even take a day off
Twenty-somethin' years, I never had a fuckin' day job
Never ask for truth, it's what expected, it's a trade-off

Real nigga shit, gettin' money bound to flip
Now turned on like I'm the shit
Bitch, I told you how it gets
It's that mixtape rap, blunt wrapped up in a album
In a Audi black, tote straps lookin' for yack
So I can go top speed with the blinkers on
Screamin' "Fuck the world", Martin King is gone
Who am I? Who am I?
Handsome guy, might stunt on you niggas with a patch on my eye
Please turn up the headphones, I speak the value
I pray for freaks, we gon' bring the outcome
Toke, toke and choke
We just need your vocals
So this is the future, ain't what your used to
Four years ago I was poorer than you are
Trappin' in the lobby and the back of a U-Haul
It's that work hard, play hard
I just got a blow job
Smoke so much this year, we couldn't even take a day off
Twenty-somethin' years, I never had a fuckin' day job
Never ask for truth, it's what expected, it's a trade-off
It's that work hard, play hard
Make you quit that day job
I smoked so much this year, we couldn't even take a day off
I plan to take a trip
Want the money how it's spent
I just re-up
Plus I just paid my phone and the rent
This that work hard, play hard
Rest in peace to Trayvon
Did so much different drugs this year, I'm feelin' so amazin'
LSD, them potent doses, smokin' 'til I take off
Two freaks, one Meech, that's an even trade-off

Rosemary's baby, the hand that rock my cradle to the grave
I had six exorcisms this year alone and I feel the same
I'm high and sleep deprived, havin' nightmares while I'm still awake
40 ounce sipper, until my liver give away
I think I lost my mind and I'm willin' to trade my soul if you can find it
An even exchange, I'm young and deranged
All these drugs in my body
Rawer than the kilo under my granddaddy pillow
Kill a cop, la-la-laugh, reload
Ha-ha-ha, drop classics, we know
Laugh at you niggas
I average fifty, I don't feel the need to pass to you niggas
Roll up the sticky, young irrational nigga
Don't throw stones unless your crib is shatter-proof nigga
A headshot, now let's see if you splatter-proof nigga
Work hard, play hard
Make you quit that day job
I smoked so much this year we couldn't even take a day off
I plan to take a trip
Want the money how it's spent
I just re-up
Plus I just paid my phone and the rent
Work hard, play hard
I just got a blow job
Smoke so much this year, we couldn't even take a day off
Twenty-somethin' years, I never had a fuckin' day job
Never ask for truth, it's what expected, it's a trade-off
Work hard, play hard
Rest in peace to Trayvon
Did so much different drugs this year I'm feeling so amazing
LSD them potent doses smoking 'til I take off
