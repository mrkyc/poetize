I have ascended, I'm tryna be better than God
What the fuck am I sayin'?

I have ascended, I'm tryna be better than God
What the fuck am I sayin'? I ain't even enter my prime
Takin' over the world, won't do it one day at a time
Time is an illusion, I think that I'm losin' my mind
I have ascended, I'm tryna be better than God
What the fuck am I sayin'? I ain't even enter my prime
Takin' over the world, won't do it one day at a time
Time is an illusion, I think that I'm losin' my mind

You might've heard that I got touch like Midas
I might just use pliers to pull teeth, don't bite us
That bites us, red dot, head shot
Kick rocks or bite dust, don't like us? Then try us
Your family get tied up, your wifey, she tied up
'Cause she fucked the both us so much
Swear you should probably use that gun on yo' holster
And bang yourself, now you know, cancel, you're over
Chip off the ol' block, chip on my shoulders
See pain in my eyes, burden on shoulders
Why God moved the sun without burnin' his shoulders?
I'm cold, bruh, venomous cobra
Clutch on my weapon raised from waist to shoulder
Level, you lookin' disheveled, I'm on a new level
The Devil conducts all his tests in the ghetto
Go 'head and contest with a rebel, roll heavy with metal
I'm readin' your mental 'cause
You might also like
I have ascended, I'm tryna be better than God
What the fuck am I sayin'? I ain't even enter my prime
Takin' over the world, won't do it one day at a time
Time is an illusion, I think that I'm losin' my mind
I have ascended, I'm tryna be better than God
What the fuck am I sayin'? I ain't even enter my prime
Takin' over the world, won't do it one day at a time
Time is an illusion, I think that I'm losin' my mind
You are now listening to FBZ Satellite Radio broadcasting through all dimensions
