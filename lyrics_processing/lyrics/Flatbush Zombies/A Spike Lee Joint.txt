Unsigned and independent
Look, tell my moms I did it
When you risk your life, constant struggle to survive
Say yeah, oh, woah
Unsigned and independent (Woo)
I move a mile a minute (Difference)
When you risk your life (Difference), constant struggle to survive (Ayy, ayy)
Say yeah, oh, woah

Dirty money, clean money, niggas see the difference
Tell the bartender leave some liquor for my niggas
Streets full of wolves so my appetite grew
I was hungry for this rap shit way back in high school
Motivated, knocked somebody off to break the rule
Coordinated mind-frame slaughterin' your view
Smokin' on this green trees, I don't get the blues
If I see a nigga lurk, then I gotta chuck a deuce
I was clockin' out of work
'Round the same time I was writin' out of thirst
Working three jobs, I ain't want to buy the purp
Friends'll leave ya cold turk'
It was ADHD, smokin' weed before church
Now I'm back for 'em, tap dance on the platform
With the mask on
Hit the squad for the bat phone
(Wildin') Want it, now I gotta last long
Dog, I just get a bigger jawn if he act raw

Dirty money, clean money, can you see the difference?
Got a phone call from my baby mama trippin'
Views like fuck life, what it's worth
Used to smoke mad weed before my grandma went to church
Had no ID, hip-hop before I started bumpin' Eazy-E
When ringtones was the hot shit
And B.I.G. on my conscience when I spit
NYPD on my dick since I've been
Fornicatin', investigations
Don't got no patience, all this bread I'm makin'
Used to fuck bad bitches when my grandma's on vacation
Call a bitch over, then she dipped for the weekend
Couple safes in my brib, two phones and the rocket
Crip sets on the ave like a LA Dodger
Juice man, piff man with the grams, man
Me and fam, I'm spittin' bars like a jail cell
Unsigned and independent
Look, tell my moms I did it
When you risk your life, constant struggle to survive
Say yeah, oh, woah

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh

Oh, what're you guys doin'? Oh, if I can get get on the album, that shit'd be insane. Fuck, oh my God. Shout-out from the middle of the fucking country. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Uh, what are you guys doin' over there?
I know we've been gone for a long time, but um
