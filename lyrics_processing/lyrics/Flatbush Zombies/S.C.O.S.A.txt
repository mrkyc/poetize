Hip-hop dead, that's 'cause we here
Bloodhound, I don't see fear
'Cause I smell it, name a nigga better
And his head gets severed
Inhale pain, exhale vendetta
Smoke like I got three lungs or better
I'm in Navajo print and my bitch in leopard
She ain't really my bitch but, shhh, don't tell her
Shit get hectic
I want brain, give me brain
Wash down pain with champagne
Sour diesel, hydroplane
Walkin' dead, Zombie Gang
How you gon' kill Meech? He already dead
Oh, yeah, here's a tip, bitch: aim for the head
Only Child Syndrome, lone wolf warrior
Psychedelic renegade, nigga, we The Glorious

Hey, it's Juice, mane, ridin' through the hood
Swagger on deck, ha, remind me why I should
Respect these rap niggas, most of them are liars
They just fans, man, they ain't 'bout that life
'Bout it, 'bout it, route it
Rowdy Piper, D.C. sniper
We ain't like ya, zombie brain
I need brain, I'm insane from the crane
Sip of drank, zip of dank, six packs of the Coor'
Jigga never lied, numbers over all
A few grams of coke, now that bitch off the wall
Bitch, I'm high, fuck you all
(A-A-Architect your lifestyle)
