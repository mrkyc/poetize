It's 'bout to pop off, we on the clock
What's up, doc? Shoot your shot
It's 'bout to pop off, we on the clock
Go, cartoony, when I hit 'em with the looney
Flow so fast, Road Runner can't pursue me
Lights, camera, action, I'm the main attraction
Wildin' like Coyote, got the party coming to me
I thought I saw a putty cat, I thought I saw a putty cat
Tweet, tweet, tweet, oh, why you haters always doin' that?
I did, I did, I did see a putty cat
Beep, beep, beep, that's my team and they got my back

We goin' looney, goin' looney, goin' looney now

Chillin' like bugs, got the coolest fans ever
Run it back to half, I'ma bring the stormy weather
Birds of a feather, flockin' it together
Quack, quack, quack, we ain't crackin' under pressure
No, what you talking 'bout?
Oh, we 'bout to knock you out
