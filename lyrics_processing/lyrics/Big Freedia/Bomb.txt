Yes, yes, yes, yes
Yaass

Take it low, get it high
Pump it like hydraulic rocks
Make it low, run it high
Bubble pop in double time
You know what I gon' get
Do it for explosives
I'm about to blow the bitch
I got the bomb

Five, four, three, two, one
Make it boom
Make it boom
Make it boom
Four, three, two, one
You better run
You better run
You better run

Make it explode when you shake it round
And when you drop it you gon' shake the ground
Tick tock I'ma count it down
I got the bomb
I got the bomb
I got the bomb
We going through bitch
Move bitch
Move bitch
We going through bitch
Move bitch
Move bitch
We going through bitch
Watch me explode bitch
You might also like
Rake it up, suck it up
Dump it like a dumper truck
Drop it down, pick it up
Show me you've got stamina
You've been working all week
Now it's time to party
Get up outta your seat
Go head freak

Five, four, three, two, one
Make it boom
Make it boom
Make it boom
Four, three, two, one
You better run
You better run
You better run

Make it explode when you shake it round
And when you drop it you gon' shake the ground
Tick tock I'ma count it down
I got the bomb
I got the bomb
I got the bomb
We going through bitch
Move bitch
Move bitch

We going through bitch
Watch me explode bitch
Rake it up, suck it up
Dump it like a dumper truck
Drop it down, pick it up
Show me you've got stamina
You've been working all week
Now it's time to party
Get up outta your seat
Go head freak

Five, four, three, two, one
