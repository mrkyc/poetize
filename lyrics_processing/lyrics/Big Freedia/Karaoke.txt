Give a fuck about landlords, when we some outlaws
Baby you could get ran off, a nigga not soft (Big what?)

Fuck a hater 'cause you should know better

Touch down on the stage
No, a bitch ain't come to play (Ain't come to play)
Clap clap when I sing
So I know that you're feelin' me
Oh, if you live this loud
Show it, show it, show it, oh
It's your moment now
Sing it, sing it, sing it, shout
