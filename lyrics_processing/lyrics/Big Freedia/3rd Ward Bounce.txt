When you twinkle and you wiggle and you smile for daddy
Walking down the streets with a drink in my hands
Like, I don't give a fuck it is New Orleans

We do it for the No
We do it for the 5-0-4
We do it for the bounce
We renting out a  house
We do it for the No

We renting out a  house
We do it for the No
