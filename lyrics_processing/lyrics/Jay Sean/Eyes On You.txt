No, whoa-ooh-ooh

You can tell your girlfriends 'bout me
It's about time to get rowdy
You know I wanna work that body
Uh, come work it over here
You can be my brown-eyed beauty
And I bet you see right through me
You can do anything to me, oh-oh

You're so beautiful
Tonight anything is possible
And you know I just can't get enough
Of your love, so give it up

Got my eyes on you
Won't you bring that back to me?
Got my eyes on you
You know where I'm gonna be
Got my eyes on you
And I see you checkin' me
Got my eyes on you
Ooh, and I like what I see
You might also like
Hold on, hold on

You can tell anyone about it
Show it off, no need to hide it
Come on, get a little excited (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Excite it over here
Don't stop, baby girl, don't stop
I know you really like it when you're on top
Don't be shy, just give it up
Come on girl!

You're so beautiful
Tonight anything is possible
And you know I just can't get enough
Of your love, so give it up (Uh-oh)

Got my eyes on you (I got my eyes)
Won't you bring that back to me?
Got my eyes on you
You know where I'm gonna be (Where I'm gonna be)
Got my eyes on you
And I see you checkin' me
Got my eyes on you
Ooh, and I like what I see (Ha)
Hold on

Oh-oh, oh-oh, your body's whining
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bumping and grinding
Oh-oh, oh-oh, stop and rewind it
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Hold on
Oh-oh, oh-oh, getting you hot now
Oh-oh, oh-oh, baby, don't stop now
Oh-oh, oh-oh, got you on lockdown
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

Got my eyes on you (Got my whole eyes on you)
Won't you bring that back to me?
Got my eyes on you (I got my whole eyes on you)
You know where I'm gonna be
Got my eyes on you (Oh-oh)
And I see you checkin' me (See you checkin' me)
Got my eyes on you
Ooh, and I like what I see

Got my eyes on you
Won't you bring that back to me? (Oh, come on, bring it back to me)
Got my eyes on you (I got my eyes on you)
You know where I'm gonna be (You know where I wanna be)
Got my eyes on you
And I see you checkin' me (Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Got my eyes on you
