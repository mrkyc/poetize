Ooh, do you? Do you? Do you?

Ooh babe, I'm watchin' you, baby
Me and you in the mirror
And baby I love, the faces you make
Can be any clearer

We gon' be workin' all through the night
Puttin' in overtime, and you know exactly what I need
So turn the music down, I wanna hear the sounds
Of us alone, it's only me and you

Don't stop doin' what you do
Keep doing what you do, do, do you? Do you?
Do you like the way I'm doin' you?
When I do you, you, do you? Do you?

Do you like the way that I put it down on you?
It's only me and you
Do you like the way that I put it down on you?
Do you? Do you? Do you?
Do you, intoxicate me, and I get a rush from you
(Do you? Do you?)
Girl, it's runnin' through my veins
Can you feel it in the same kind of places?

We gon' be workin' all through the night
Puttin' in overtime, and you know, exactly what I need
So turn the music down, I wanna hear the sounds
Of us alone, it's only me and you

Don't stop doin' what you do
Keep doing what you do, do, do you? Do you?
Do you like the way I'm doin' you?
When I do you, you, do you? Do you?

Do you like the way that I put it down on you?
It's only me and you
Do you like the way that I put it down on you?
Do you? Do you? Do you?

Do you mind if I take my time and do this right?
Do you know how I feel inside? I'll show you tonight
It's gettin' closer, closer, closer
So don't stop doin' what you do
Don't stop doin' what you do
Keep doin' what you do, do, do you? Do you?
Do you like the way I'm doin' you?
When I do you, you, do you? Do you?
Don't stop doin' what you do
Keep doin' what you do, do, do you? Do you?
Do you like the way I'm doin' you?
When I do you, you, do you? Do you?
