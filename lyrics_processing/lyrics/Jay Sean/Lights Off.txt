I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired it's you that I'm missing
It's like my brain is wired up and there's a glitch in my system
You're like a drug and now my blood won't stop itchin'
I'm in critical condition
Someone let me out of this prison

It's like my mind is playin' tricks on me lately
I could've sworn that you was still my baby
I'm on a merry-go-round, goin' around
Drivin me crazy
That's why, it feels like

Losing you, is like somebody, just turned all the lights off
Won't somebody, anybody, please just turn the lights on
Won't take
One step
Can't see what's coming next, cause
Losing you, is like somebody
Just turned all, the lights off
Can't see at all (at all)
At all (at all)
Can't see at all (Noo..)
Oh no!
Can't see at all (at all)
Cause it's like somebody
Just turned all the lights off
You might also like
I don't understand how one minute I just had it all
And now I can't reach you cause I'm tied up with this straitjacket on
I can't breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
I can't see, see, see, see, see, see, see

It's like my mind is playin' tricks on me lately
I could've sworn that you was still my baby
I'm on a merry-go-round, goin' around
Drivin me crazy
That's why, it feels like

Losing you, is like somebody, just turned all the lights off
Won't somebody, anybody, please just turn the lights on
Won't take
One step
Can't see what's coming next, cause
Losing you, is like somebody
Just turned all, the lights off
Can't see at all (at all)
At all (at all)
Can't see at all (Noo..)
Oh no!
Can't see at all (at all)
Cause it's like somebody
Just turned all the lights off
Used to see my world in color girl
Where you left me it's like my world turned gray
Turned my winter into summer girl
Why won't you help me tonight today
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think at all
Honestly, it feels like I ain't living no more
Can't say no more, can't see no more...

And baby that's why it feels like

Losing you, is like somebody, just turned all the lights off Won't somebody, anybody, please just turn the lights on
Cause I can't take
One step
Can't see what's coming next, cause
Losing you, is like somebody
Just turned all, the lights off,(Just turned all the lights off...)
Can't see at all (at all)
At all (at all)
Can't see at all
Oh no!
Can't see at all (at all)
Cause it's like somebody
