Bitin' on your neck
Don't be scared to bite back
Once I get you wet know you can't fight that
Soaking in the sheets hope you got another set
Cause when I'm done guarantee we gon' leave a mess
Rubbing on my tatts put this ice on your chest
Sex all night one on one no stress
Uh, get you high when I'm going low
Got the heavy metal shit no rock n roll
Roll you up now I'm licking in your ear lobe
Nice and slow, like usher though
Most women they tempt me to move fast
But I'mma make the time stretch like gym class
Bet you never had, keep you coming back
To back, to back, to back
