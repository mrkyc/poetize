Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Won't you stay?

You said it once, said it twice
That it hurts but I do it again
I don't change, I won't learn, 'cause I can't let it end
Said it's gone, let it be, cause you don't need a friend
Maybe I do
I pull and you push and we cry 'til we laugh again
I promise you, you promise me back and then why
Does it all fall apart in just a matter of time?

So I'm thinking, maybe you've made up your mind
'Cause you're distant (Distant)
And I can't stand to fight no more
So please don't, make me, hurt you like I do
I don't really trust myself to leave
Even though I hear you saying, "Baby, no, no"

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't take no more of this
And I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you still let me in
Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Won't you stay?

Memories of the fun that we had on photographs on the wall
Now I can't make you smile or hear you laugh anymore
And I can't help but ask, what's the point of it all?
Tell me, baby
Call it love, call it lame, call it joy, call it pain, but I fell
Call it, girl, what you may but it's painful as hell
To be here while you're there, don't need nobody else

So I'm thinking maybe you've made up your mind
'Cause you're distant (Distant)
And I can't stand to fight no more
So please don't make me hurt you like I do
I don't really trust myself to leave even though you're telling me

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't take no more of this
And I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you still let me in
Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay (Oh, don't go)
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Won't you stay?

If you're so meant for me and if I'm so meant for you
Why did this have to be so hard on both of us two?
If you're so meant for me and if I'm so meant for you
Why did this have to be so hard on both of us two?
Still you're saying
No, no, no, no, no, no no
I can't take no more of this
And I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you still let me in
Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay (Baby, stay)
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Won't you stay?

Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
