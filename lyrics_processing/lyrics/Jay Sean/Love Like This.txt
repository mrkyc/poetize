I never thought I'd see a love like this (like this)
A love like this
A love like this
Yeahhh
Lately, I've been thinking about
How you changed me
I'm not even playing around
But that ain't me
That ain't me now
Girl why's this happening
Never looking back again
Baby you don't need to change
Cause you make me wanna give you my last name
And even though we have our highs and lows
Girl if there's one thing I know
I will love you eternally
For eternity
They'll never break us down
I will love you eternally
For eternity
And I'll always be around
And I never thought I'd find a love like this (like this)
Never thought I'd find a love like this
And I'm so glad I gotta love like this
Gotta love, gotta love, gotta love
That's why I love you for you
You, you, you, you, you, you
That's why I love you for you
You, you, you, you, you, you
They say that we've been moving too fast
And you say baby tell me more 'bout your past
That ain't me, that ain't me now
They be confusing you, ima keep it true to you
Baby you don't need to change
Cause you make me wanna give you my last name
And even though we have our highs and lows
Girl if there's one thing I know
I will love you eternally
For eternity
They'll never break us down
I will love you eternally
For eternity
And I'll always be around
And I never thought I'd find a love like this (like this)
Never thought I'd find a love like this
And I'm so glad I gotta love like this
Gotta love, gotta love, gotta love
That's why I love you for you
You, you, you, you, you, you
That's why I love you for you
You, you, you, you, you, you
Said if your with the one you love tonight then let me here you say
Oh-ho (oh-ho)
Said if your with the one you love tonight then let me here you say
Oh-ho (oh-ho)
And if you can't be with the one you love
Then just try and love the one you with
Say oh-ho (oh-ho)
Say yeah (Yeahhh)
I will love you eternally
For eternity
They'll never break us down
I will love you eternally
For eternity
And I'll always be around
And I never thought I'd find a love like this (like this)
Never thought I'd find a love like this
And I'm so glad I gotta love like this
Gotta love, gotta love, gotta love
That's why I love you for you
You, you, you, you, you, you
That's why I love you for you
