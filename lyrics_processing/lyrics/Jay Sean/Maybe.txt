Beep, beep, oh look, now there goes my phone
And once again I'm just hoping it's a text from you, mm
It ain't right, I read your messages twice, thrice
Four times a night, it's true

Everyday I patiently wait
Feeling like a fool but I do anyway
Nothing can feel as sweet and as real
As knowing I wasn't waiting in vain

And maybe it's true, I'm caught up on you
Maybe there's a chance that you're stuck on me too
So maybe I'm wrong, it's all in my head
Maybe we're afraid of words, we both hadn't said

I'm always connected on-line, check Facebook all the time
Hoping you've checked my profile
Just can't help wondering why you play it cool
But see I'm hopelessly falling for you

Every night on my phone I hook up with you
And I don't even like it, girl
All joking aside, what say? You and I
Come out and see what we're trying to hide
You might also like
And maybe it's true, oh, I'm caught up on you
Maybe there's a chance that you're stuck on me too
So maybe I'm wrong, it's all in my head
Maybe we're afraid of words we both hadn't said

Like I really want you, I think I need you
Baby, I miss you, I'm thinking of you
Like I really want you, I think I need you
Baby, I miss you, I'm thinking of you

And maybe it's true, oh, I'm caught up on you
Maybe there's a chance that you're stuck on me too
So maybe I'm wrong, it's all in my head
Maybe we're afraid of words we both hadn't said
And maybe it's true, I'm caught up on you
Maybe there's a chance that you're stuck on me too
So maybe I'm wrong and it's all in my head
Maybe we're afraid of words we both hadn't said
