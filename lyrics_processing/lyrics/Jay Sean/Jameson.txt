What is this poison that's crawlin' under my veins
Teasin' and feedin' me tales, numbin' my brain
It's pullin' me back to it
Am I that bastard that everyone's laughin' at?
When they see me trapped in your grasp
There ain't nothing that no one else can do
It's like I see a new me anytime I'm with you
But you're gonna tear my heart apart
You, you're gonna help me lie

Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Aaa
(Sweet) (Sweet) You should've warned me baby
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Aaa

(Sweet) Sweet Jameson
Love me in evening
And hurt me in the morning
And leave me without warning
Oh sweet Jameson
Ohhh sweet, (sweet) (sweet)
Ohhh sweet, ohhh sweet, ohhh sweet

You was always my baby
You would come first
When I needed saving
Jaime, you were my world
I would drown in your love
Till it all becomes a blur
And I'd leave all my dignity there
Oh what a sight to see
I can't stand, but I won't fall
Just say I'm your only, just say it once more
Just don't break my heart apart
But you you're gonna help lie

Every night it's the same old routine
Spray your favorite cologne
You say you like it on me
That's when I head to the spot
Take out a couple of G's
And now I feel like the man
They got they eyes on me
Don't even need to request
They already know what my question is
I must say I'm impressed the way you already undressed for me
Take a taste of you slowly when I hold you next to me
When you touch my lips it's like you take all the stress from me
Feel the warmth in my chest
I love it, let it all burn through
It's like you know me best and you're the one that I turn to
When my head starts spinning it's when I come to my senses
Like who the fuck am I kidding
Every man in this building's sayin'
 (x2)

Oh, sweet Jameson
Oh sweet what, (sweet) (sweet) Ohhh sweet, Jameson
