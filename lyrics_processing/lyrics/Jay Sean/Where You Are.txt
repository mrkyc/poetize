When sometimes you wake up young, and sometimes you wake up old
And sometimes you're so in love
And Do you know the feeling
When their love just comes undone
And I can't figure it out
What something's got me unlock, but you my baby
There were some times I put up a fight
But when something is right, you know that is right
And I dont wanna think, it's simple to me, you're the one
And baby that's why...
And I can't help it, I gotta be where you are
Like the sky holding the stars
Like the strings on my guitar
I wanna be where you are
Like the sand that's on the beach
Like a model in a magazine
It dont mean a thing, if we're apart
I wanna be where you are
Where you are, where you are
And that's it baby I wanna be where you are
And baby everytime youre around
You're the one that always holds me down
And dont even ask for a thing, no
You make a real win, even when things ain't perfect
You're the one that keeps the fire burning
And that's the reason why, I ain't leaving
