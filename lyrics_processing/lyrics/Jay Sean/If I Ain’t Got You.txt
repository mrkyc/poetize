Hey pretty baby, you got me going crazy
I am down when i ain't got you
Cuz baby girl you do it for me
Won't you put it on me?
I love the little things you do
So you can spend all you wana dolce and gabbana
I would buy the world for you
So i break it down if your not around
It does'nt matter if i ain't got you (if i ain't got you)
All the diamond and the pearls
Money in the world means nothing
If i ain't got you
And all the watches and the rings
And all them shiny things means nothing If i ain't got you

I had a villa in manilla
A home in Rome
Didn't matter cuz i didn't have you
Had an apartment in the sky
Summers in Dubai
Didn't matter cuz i didn't have you
I use to spend all i wana dolce and gabana
But i would trade it all for you
See girl i had it all but now that your my all
I know that nothing matters without you (without you)
All the diamond and the pearls
Money in the world means nothing
If i ain't got you
And all the watches and the rings
And all them shiny things means nothing If i ain't got you

If i ain't got you, (you) yooouuu
If i ain't got you, (you) yooouuu
If i ain't got you, (you) yooouuu

(If i ain't got you, got you)
What's life without you
A house without you
They don't mean nothing if i am without you, Its true
None of it matters girl more than you do
My life feels brand new
Every minute every time that your with me
And all the time girl i hope that you'll still be
Cuz all i need in this world is you and me, cuz baby
All the diamond and the pearls
Money in the world means nothing
If i ain't got you
And all the watches and the rings
And all them shiny things means nothing If i ain't got you

If i ain't got you, (you) yooouuu
If i ain't got you, (you) yooouuu
If i ain't got you, (you) yooouuu

And if that diamond ring don't shine
Then daddy's gana buy you the whole damn mine..
