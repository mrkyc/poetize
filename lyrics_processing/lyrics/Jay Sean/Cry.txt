I need to see you cry
I wanna, I wanna see you cry
Won't rest until I see you cry
Yeah, I cry, I cry, I cry

Had me convinced that I just wasn't enough
Me and you fussin' and fightin', cussin' all of that stuff
Now I know that I might've done you wrong
Didn't know I'd pay so long 'til you did the same
I know I'd done you wrong, I was makin' it up to you
I apologized in a million ways
But I thought that was that
But I guess you got me back
Didn't know it'd be like that but you did the same

Now we're caught in a circle, a constant battle
The day that you hurt me
The clouds cast a shadow on us
And I hope that you're happy we're even now
So cry, baby, cry

Let me see you cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Want ya tears to fall down on me
Cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Want ya tears to fall down on me
You might also like
Before the love just turns to hate
Before I ask for you to stay
And just before you walk away

What is this what happens to relationships?
Started off so good and ended up so bad
Baby, I just wanna know, ooh, tell me do you know, baby?
Before we knew it we were at it again, no, no, no
Somehow I don't think we can ever be friends
Wish it wasn't so, ooh, wish it wasn't so but you did the same

Now we're caught in a circle, a constant battle
The day that you hurt me
The clouds cast a shadow on us
And I hope that you're happy we're even now
So cry, baby, cry

Let me see you cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Want ya tears to fall down on me
Cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Fall down on me
So we go on and on on this merry-go-round
Tryin' to chase a love that can never be found
Time to say goodbye and step off of it now
It's over, girl, it's over
So we go on and on, on this merry-go-round
Tryin' to chase a love that can never be found
Time to say goodbye and step off of it now
It's over, girl, it's over

Let me see you cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Want ya tears to fall down on me
Cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Want ya tears to fall down on me

I need to see you cry
I wanna, I wanna see you cry
Won't rest until I see you cry
