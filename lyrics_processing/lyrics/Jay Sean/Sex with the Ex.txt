You ain't gotta act brand new, nah
Like you ain't been here before
You know you been here before girl
You ain't gotta act brand new, nah
I swear ain't a damn thing changed
I'mma put it on you like you're still my main, cause there

Ain't nothing like sexing with your ex
Ain't nothing like sexing with your ex

Tonight I'm sexing with my ex
I'mma do you right, do you right
Sexing with my ex
Tonight I'm sexing with my ex
I'mma do you right, do you right
Sexing with my ex

5 O' clock and your moaning, and we ain't look back
And we both know this is wrong, and a whole lotta bad
And we swore on everything to never call or text
But how can we go on as friends when I know that
You might also like
There be some other guy that be lovin' my girl
Hands all over my baby
So how can you explain why you're creepin' and acting all shady
Got you biting the pillow while up in that thing
Cuh what he do ain't the same
Cause baby this ain't love that we make, no
 + 

I know we had a few problems, I wasn't always there
And I messed up one too many times
But what we always had, was a lotta second chances
For me to prove you wrong, to see where you belong

Yeah you still my main
Still the best with that brain
Still the one to drive me insane
Still the best in that game
Love a girl that'll know what to do with her mouth and won't hold back
Ain't talking 'bout fighting and all that
Shoulda made you my wifey 'fore that
So what we just sexing
A little late night drunk texting
Ain't nobody asking no questions
Pics blowing up my phone like you wanna let me know what I had with you back then
Girl I know you ain't the type to play the fool with
So I'mma just cut the bullshit
If you wanna just fuck let's do this
