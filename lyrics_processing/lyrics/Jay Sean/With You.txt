Jay Sean, yeah
Gucci

Even though you know I like it, you ain't nothin' new
Even though you know I love it, I'm in love with you
I ain't tryna say I like it, girl, you know the truth
You know that I fuckin' love it, fucking 'round with you

That's my ride or die, I can't even lie
Shawty flyer than a pilot and got way too much to hide
What she like, Birkin bags and bikes
And she don't care about likes (Nah, nah)
Twistin' right right, oakwood pokin' out, yeah, that's what I like
Outta sight, outra mind
Keep them broke hoes out my sight
This the night, when we dim the lights, I pound with all my might
She so right, we so right, ain't no need to be your type
Got that fire, ask her what she drink, she said "Guwop on ice"

I'm sayin' you (Han)
I just can't get my mind off you
After the shit that we've been through (Yeah)
I just can't stop fuckin' with you
I just can't stop fuckin' with you

Even though you know I love it, I'm in love with you
I ain't tryna say I like it, girl, you know the truth
You know that I fuckin' love it, fucking 'round with you

I cannot keep doin' this, it ain't safe
I did not promise that you'd take my name
Told you from day, said that straight to your face
Can't be the one if you in second place, it's not that way
You start actin' crazy, know that I'll go MIA
Been talking Miami, you won't find me out of space
Wait, all up in our feelings, wasn't supposed to be that way
Wait, I can't escape, yeah

'Cause, baby, you (Yeah)
I just can't get my mind off you
After the shit that we've been through (Yeah)

I just can't stop fuckin' with you

You know that I fuckin' love it, fucking 'round with you
Fuckin' with you
Fiendin' for attention, leave niggas on read
They ain't fuckin' with you
Ran through the block, went broke, came up
Stayed down, real bitch, put the pussy on you
Dreaming 'bout cars, S6, with a Rollie on the wrist
Cute face, concrete
Girls gon' hate 'cause a bitch gon' slay too fast
Baby, just part of all my drip
'Cause I like it, I just fuck wanna fuck
He off the drugs, so please don't bite it
Feindin' for my love, daddy hit me up, baby, I'm excited

Even though you know I like it, you ain't nothin' new
Even though you know I love it, I'm in love with you
I ain't tryna say I like it, girl, you know the truth
You know that I fuckin' love it, fucking 'round with you

Fucking 'round with you
Fucking 'round with you
