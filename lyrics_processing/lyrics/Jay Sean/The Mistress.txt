I was thinking some day, I'd grow out of this phase
What a big mistake that was
Isn't love that we make, I'm caught up in this maze
Wish it haven't have begun
I'm too weak to leave
But God I can't stand myself no more
And she calls me angel
But that ain't the truth, you know, you know

And even though it's wrong that I'm living such a lie
I just can't leave you alone
The more that we go on, this guilt just builds up inside
Still I can't leave you alone

No I just can't leave my mistress
No I just can't leave my mistress
Why do you feel like something that I shouldn't hide
I just can't leave you alone

She wakes me with a kiss, some coffee in my bed
After I just crept in way after six
Smelling of your perfume, all in my bedroom
I don't understand why she don't say shit
Maybe she's weak, maybe I know
That's why I can't stand myself no more
She must be an angel
To know but never say, to see but look away
You might also like
And even though it's wrong that I'm living such a lie
I just can't leave you alone
The more that we go on, this guilt just builds up inside
Still I can't leave you alone

No I just can't leave my mistress
No I just can't leave my mistress
So why do you feel like something that I shouldn't hide
I just can't leave you alone

Girl I just can't, I just can't leave you alone
I just can't, I just can't leave you alone
I just can't, I just can't leave you alone
I just can't, I just can't leave you alone

No I just can't leave my mistress
No I just can't leave my mistress
Why do you feel like something that I shouldn't hide
