Oh you got me so high like I'm Lando
Cloud City got the Falcon
You out in London living that boujee life
Stole my heart and now you gone now
Hold me up, let it drink, let me grind now
Let me sip the pain 'til I pass out
These girls are all fake diamonds
May I know where to got the real thing?

You know it's 2 am in LA
I'm too messed up to think straight out
I'm tryin' hard not to break
And blowin' up your phone like

Do you love me like I love you?
Do you breathe me like I breathe you?
Do you want me like I want you?
Do you feel the things I feel for you?
'Cause you got me on the phone like

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you feel the things I feel for you?
You might also like
I know you turnin' those heads when you're out at night
And you know I'm all about it
Like to stay outside out of my ride
Way too many thoughts, it's crowded
Hold me up, let it drink, let me grind now
Let me sip the pain 'til I pass out
These girls are all fake diamonds
And yeah, you know I got the real thing

You know it's 2 am in LA
I'm too messed up to think straight out
Tryin' hard not to break
And blowin' up your phone like

Do you love me like I love you?
Do you breathe me like I breathe you?
Do you want me like I want you?
Do you feel the things I feel for you?
'Cause you got me on the phone like

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you feel the things I feel for you?
Its 2 am in LA
I'm tryin' hard not to break
But it's 2 am in LA
And you got me on the phone like
Do you love me? (yeah)
Girl, do you love me?
'Cause you got me on the phone like

Do you love me? (Do you love me, baby?)
