Early in the morning I wake up to you
Asking me if I'd ever lie to you

Cause if you didn't notice I came home to you
Cause baby lovin' you is all I ever wanna do

Girl I only want you
You're the only one I want
It's only us two
Cause baby you're the one
And lovin' you is all I ever wanna do
Girl I only want you
You're the only one I want
It's only us two
Cause baby you're the one
And lovin' you is all I ever wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
And lovin' you is all I ever wanna do

Yo what's with the all the questions asking me what time I came home to you?
And what's with all the checking on me, I only got one thing to prove
You might also like
Cause if you didn't notice I came home to you
Cause baby lovin' you is all I ever wanna do
It's all I ever want

Girl I only want you
You're the only one I want
It's only us two
Cause baby you're the one
And lovin' you is all I ever wanna do
Girl I only want you
You're the only one I want

Cause baby you're the one
And lovin' you is all I ever wanna do

Take my phone if it helps, it ain't even password protected
It's just the truth I've accepted
It's what I should have expected
You saw those messages from next bitches
I told you all of those lies
I thought we dealt with it so why mention it?
I can't move on if you don't try
Nah, nah, nah, never that, think again
Shit, I've been there through thick and thin
Baby there was that once you keep reminding me of
But you can't call that shit love, she can't come in between us
Us no girl, no I only want you
You're the only one I want
It's only us two
Cause baby you're the one
And lovin' you is all I ever wanna do
Girl I only want you
You're the only one I want
It's only us two
Cause baby you're the one
And lovin' you is all I ever wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
