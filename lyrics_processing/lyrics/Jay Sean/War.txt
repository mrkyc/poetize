And I would lie here in the trenches with your picture next to me
And when I told you it's forever, then it's how its gonna be
Don't, won't let him just take the place of me (No..)
Does he really know you like I know you, all the little things?
Does he really love you, like I love you, how can he compete?
If he makes me fight for you, die for you, would he do the same?
This is turning into way more than a game..
Now it feels like soldiers in a war and none of us are backing down
And I will show you victory is mine before we leave this battleground
Cause he don't wanna leave, and I don't wanna go
And I know just how this battle goes
He don't wanna leave and I don't wanna fight this kind of war
You know he's not the man you think he is; he's hiding all his flaws
So tell me what's the point of fighting? Because we'll all end up with scars
But girl if that's what I must go through, then I'm not prepared to lose
Cause I've already bled so much for you (No..)
Does he really know you like I know you, all the little things?
Does he really love you, like I love you, how can he compete?
If he makes me fight for you, I die for you, would he do the same?
Baby this is turning into way more than a game..

Cause he don't wanna leave, and I don't wanna go

He don't wanna leave and I don't wanna fight this kind of war (No, No..)
Getting kind of sick of this battle
Wish I could take it back to when I had you
I'm always thinking that I can have you, just let him have you
It's getting kinda hard to convince you
After all the shit that we've been through
Why would you let all this happen?
You gotta choice to make it stop
It's already going too far..
Girl we're soldiers in a war and none of us are backing down
And I will show you victory is mine before we leave this battleground
