I'm all yours tonight (Jay Sean)
Got a feeling that I can't deny (Mr. 305)
Everything about you gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
I'm all yours

Success is here, and she don't play
I'm ready for her though, throw her my way
Heart torn, and I doubt you can save it
It's soul carries me like thousand sounds baby
Thoughts deep scuba
My mind is free opposite of Cuba
Take me for my money or my fame
Papo don't try, see right through ya
Four lawsuits, one near, two down, two to go
Been a expensive year, good thing I know
I was built for the war, I was built to be all yours
Abuelita's a rebel, my mother's fighter
Tia is a G, and my sister a rider

I'm all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I can't deny
Everything about you gets me high
Girl, I want this for the rest of my life

Everything about you gets me high
Girl, I want this for the rest of my life
