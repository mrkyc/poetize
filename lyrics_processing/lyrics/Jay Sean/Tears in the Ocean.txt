You told me I don't love you, don't say that
Put no one above you, you know that
I know that I fucked up, one time
Don't right me off for life, it ain't right
How many sorrys will it take?
How much of me talking and setting straight?
Don't even remember the girls name
You're my forever and that won't change

You said you only ever wanted honesty
I'm standing here tryin' to give you all of me
Don't tell me that you're love is running cold for me
When we both know that's not true

I dropped a tear in the ocean
When they find it, that's when I'll stop loving you
Now I'm lost in a sea of emotion
Forever blinded, falling deeper into the blue
Oooh, you'll never find my tears in the ocean
Oooh, they'll never find my tears

Who knows where to touch you like me?
Who's gonna love you like me?
Who's gonna run to you when you're lonely?
Oh you know it's me, girl you know it's me
You might also like
You said you only ever wanted honesty
I'm standing here tryin' to give you all of me
Don't tell me that you're love is running cold for me
When we both know that's not true

I dropped a tear in the ocean
When they find it, that's when I'll stop loving you
Now I'm lost in a sea of emotion
Forever blinded, falling deeper into the blue
Oooh, you'll never find my tears in the ocean
Oooh, they'll never find my tears

Just say something, say anything now
Look at me, don't hold your head down
Weren't we some shit, we can turn it all round
It'll take some work
It might sound like I'm making some excuses
When I say baby I'm just a man
She was just a flash in the pants
Something that I didn't plan
But it's all I gotta give
And for you I shed a tear
I dropped a tear in the ocean
When they find it, that's when I'll stop loving you
Now I'm lost in a sea of emotion
Forever blinded, falling deeper into the blue
Oooh, you'll never find my tears in the ocean
Oooh, they'll never find my tears (such they'll never find my tears)
Such you'll never find my tears
