I ain't gonna lie with you is where I wanna be
All up in the club, the finest girl I see
I know that you want me to come over to you and talk
I'm just tryna keep it real with you
Are you feeling me the way I'm feeling you
You go call your crew and I'ma call my crew
'Coz Jay, Rishi Rich and Juggy D are coming through
Kurri soni te akh mastani
Tu giddha de rani, ne gal sun ja
Tu dil kholeyain te mere man mohleyain
Te ek galan horiyan, ne gal sun ja
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
I just wanna dance with you
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
Nachnaa, nachnaa, nachnaa
Girl, what have I told you?
Been thinking of all the possible lyrical ways
To come and approach you
Haven't been able to think of anything
Other than wanting to reach ya
I ain't tryna speech ya
I ain't gonna use any lyrics to impress ya
A gentleman from the start
I'll get you a drink at the bar
Thinking I'm making you tickle and laugh
Telling me you wanna head to the car
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me
So get your coat 'coz tonight you're leaving with me
Now I've got you in my ride
Tell me what's on your mind
Shall we continue moving on, cruising on
Girl, we're heading to my home
(We're heading to my home)
We'll take it nice and slow
(Take it nice and slow)
And I will show you what it is I wanna do
(But only if you dare)
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
I just wanna dance with you
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
Nachnaa, nachnaa, nachnaa
I just want you next to me
A lil' taste of ecstasy
Tomorrow you'll be texting me
You know it's true
Girl, if you just roll with me
Maybe get to know with me
If you wanna maybe come on home with me
And we can do whatever you wanna do
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
I just wanna dance with you
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
Nachnaa, nachnaa, nachnaa
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
I just wanna dance with you
Ho mehta tere naal nachnaa
