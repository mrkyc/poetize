I ain't gon' lie to you, baby
I ain't gon' lie, never lied to you, baby
I know you been actin' crazy
'Cause I was spendin' time on your mind on the daily
I bet you can see my face
Every time your new chick scream your name
And you miss the way I taste
Nobody love you better, no, there ain't no way

I wanna know while you're checkin' your phone
Are you hoping it's me every time you're alone?
Come on, spend the night with me, baby
Come on, hit rewind with me, baby, oh

You love the way my body moves
When I flex the way I do
I know you think about it too
When I flex the way I do
'Cause you got a real one right here
Yeah, you had a real one right here
I know you're with somebody new
But she don't flex the way I, flex the way I do
You might also like
Flex the way I do
Flex the way I do, whoa
Flex the way I do
Flex the way I do, whoa

I know what you need, yeah, I got it
I got what you need, what you need, boy, I got it
I get what I want when I want it
So I'ma take the lead, watch the way I wine up on it

I already know while you're checkin' your phone
You been hoping it's me every time you're alone
Let me take you home in the foreign
And wake up next to me in the morning, oh

You love the way my body moves
When I flex the way I do
I know you think about it too
When I flex the way I do
'Cause you got a real one right here
Yeah, you had a real one right here
I know you're with somebody new
But she don't flex the way I, flex the way I do
Flex the way I do
Flex the way I do, whoa
