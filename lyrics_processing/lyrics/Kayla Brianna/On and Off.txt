You be acting different every time you get your hair done
You be playing 'round like you don't need me
Funny that you think that
'Member you from way back
Hit me in the DM like when you free, oh
Now your time's too expensive
Treating me like I'm a rental
You be riding me for days
Sooner or later you give me back
What type of shit is that?
I put up with you cause you fire
Talking like 1995 Mariah
Hoping nobody else getting it
You love me but then you can't stand me
Don't act up in front of my family

Girl, you know I don't like nobody in our business
Feel like we good but sometimes I'm just feeling the distance
Oh, you know, oh, you know
Nothing can hold me back from ya
I don't know, I don't know
Hard to tell cause we so

On and off, on and off yeah
Don't answer when I call, yeah
Like it's all my fault, yeah
We so on and off, on and off yeah
Oh yeah, cause I know you want me to come through
Baby we so on and off, on and off, on and off yeah
Baby we so on and off, on and off, on and off yeah
You might also like
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want ya
But you playing 'round like you don't want me
All these mixed emotions
Boy I'm losing focus
Hit me in the DM, I just leave it be
You ain't coming to your senses
Don't know what you doing with this
You be hitting me for days
But finally when I do hit you, the man in you runs and hides but
I'm one of one
Hoping nobody else getting it
Tell me how I'm supposed to be with you
Tryna have your cake and eat it too

Boy, you know I don't like nobody in our business
Feel like we good but sometimes I'm just feeling the distance
Oh you know, oh you know
Nothing can hold me back from ya
I don't know, I don't know
Hard to tell cause we so

On and off, on and off yeah
Don't answer when I call, yeah
Like it's all my fault, yeah
We so on and off, on and off yeah
Oh yeah, cause I know you want me to come through
Baby we so on and off, on and off, on and off yeah
Baby we so on and off, on and off, on and off yeah
Drink
Faded
Smoke

Cause we so on and off, on and off yeah
Don't answer when I call, yeah

Baby we so on and off, on and off, on and off yeah
