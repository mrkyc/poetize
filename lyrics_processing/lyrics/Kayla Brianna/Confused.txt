We got London on da Track

Every time you wasn't supposed to do now
Really ain't no getting over you now
Got me out here looking like fool now
How am I supposed to trust you now
Sorries don't make it feel no better
This shit was supposed to be forever
You act like you in this by yourself
I feel like I'm in this by myself
You're not the one I'm used to
Tell me, where's the man that I'm used to?
There's only so much I can do
I still can't stop loving you

My friends say that you shouldn't get another chance
Daddy say that you need to learn to be a man
Mama say that you need a lil' time to
Lil' sis' telling me she really likes you, yeah

I don't know what to do, I've just been so confused
I don't know what to do, I'm just so over you (I'm just so over you)
Over you (I'm just so...)
I don't know what to do, I'm just so over you
Got me so confused (I'm just so...)
So confused
I don't know what to do
You might also like
Make we wonder if you doing this on purpose
You always keep it vague, I never know the purpose
All this back and forth, I wonder if it's worth it
I only wanted real, I never wanted perfect
Riding shotgun with my baby
Right hand on thigh make me go crazy
Feel like you've been taking me for granted lately
All you ever say is that I'm tripping late
All the sacrifices that I made for you
All these other niggas that I played for you
All these memories that we won't forget
And you mean to tell me this the thanks I get?

My friends say that you shouldn't get another chance
Daddy say that you need to learn to be a man
Mama say that you need a lil' time to
Lil' sis' telling me she really likes you, yeah

I don't know what to do, I've just been so confused
I don't know what to do, I'm just so over you (I'm just so over you)
Over you (I'm just so...)
I don't know what to do, I'm just so over you
Got me so confused (I'm just so...)
So confused
