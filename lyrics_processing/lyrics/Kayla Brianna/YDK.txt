Don't know why (Why)
Give you my love

Ooh, just say you want me the way I want you
And I want ya, confused by the way that you move
So I second guess at what you say is true
(What you say is true)

So I locked out the feelings, you couldn't deal, boy
I'm tired and you're tired, you wastin' my time
Locked out the feelings, you couldn't deal, boy
Just say you want me, but you'll never get you there

Don't know what to do
Don't know why
You say you want love (You)
You say you want trust
But you don't know what to do
Don't know why
I give you my love
I give you my trust (You)
I don't know what to
You might also like
I, I try so hard to get you off my mind
But it hurts me, should I hold on to you?
'Cause you know you'll never really get your time back
(Get your time back)

So I locked out the feelings, you couldn't deal, boy
I'm tired and you're tired, you wastin' my time
Locked out the feelings, you couldn't deal, boy
Just say you want me, but you'll never get you there

Don't know what to do
Don't know why
You say you want love (You)
You say you want trust
But you don't know what to do
Don't know why
I give you my love
I give you my trust (You)
I don't know what to

Don't know what to
Don't know what to
You
You
Don't know what to do
You
You
Don't know what to do
Don't know why
You say you want love (You)
You say you want trust
But you don't know what to do
Don't know why
I give you my love
I give you my trust (You)
