You know what I want, but you don't think I'm ready just yet
I know what you want, but I don't think you ready for it either
Let's live a fantasy, the truth will only make us upset
If you down to take a risk, baby boy, I'm with the shit
They say we too young for love, and how could both of us see both of us growing?
This feelings just like a drug, it's got us addicted, the habbit, can't kick it
Now, we might be losing control, all this emotion got us overdosing
Fuckin with me, cuttin off them hoes
I'm stuck on you, like your favorite calone

I wanna give you all of me
All of me
Got me like, baby, this is all for you
All for you
Turn up, go head, take it off of me
Off of me
I got what you been lustin for, come get it, baby

We both know this ain't goin last
Something about you is so supernatural, that I just can't let it pass
Don't look back, be stressin, on thinkin what we could've had
Visions of passion, lovin and touchin, picture you tappin this ass
Make sure you catch it when I throw it back
You might also like
I wanna give you all of me
All of me
Got me like, baby, this is all for you
All for you
Turn up, go head, take it off of me
Off of me
I got what you been lustin for, come get it, baby

It's Kid Ink
Sayin that you saw me
While lookin at the time on my arm piece
And lookin at the way I rock them jeans
I could agree that we leave, no please
With them pants painted on, you an artpiece
Come show me how you ride like a car, b
Call me, and I be there in a heartbeat
Just to make your heart skip, everytime I hit it, me
It's goodnight, when I hit it to sleep
French kissin, when I hit it cheak to cheak
Got the ass on lock, when she gave me the key
Unleash the freak, unleash the freak

I wanna give you all of me
All of me
Got me like, baby, this is all for you
All for you
Turn up, go head, take it off of me
Off of me
