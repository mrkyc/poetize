Baby, I'm good, better when I'm bad
It's whatever you say, whatever you say
Don't it feel good when I'm bein' bad?
It's whatever you say, whatever you say

I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, can you handle it?
If I go there, baby, with you
If I go there, baby, with you
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, can you handle it?
If I go there, baby, with you
If I go there, baby, with you

So baby, you can come through
When you want to, let me hold you down
Whatever you want to
Never doubt you, can you hold me down?
And I see you checkin' out my figure
If I give it to you is you gonna lick up?
I need you to run it up, like, "Baby, it's a stick up"
We can do it off the wall, yeah, I'm lookin' for a thriler

Oh, you're such a smooth operator
In your own league, you're too major
Found you just in time, life saver
Overload, too much flavor
And you know I don't do this usually
But you're bringin' out my curiousity
Really can't explain just what you do to me
Pick a fight and then I'll make up for it anyway
Baby, I'm good, better when I'm bad
It's whatever you say, whatever you say
Don't it feel good when I'm bein' bad?
It's whatever you say, whatever you say

I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, can you handle it?
If I go there, baby, with you
If I go there, baby, with you
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, can you handle it?
If I go there, baby, with you
If I go there, baby, with you

Baby, I'm good, better when I'm bad
It's whatever you say, whatever you say
Don't it feel good when I'm bein' bad?
