Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I ain't playin' hide and go seek for nobody
No, no, that's a no-go (No, no-go)
I been through too much hell to get caught up
No more, not no more
These dudes be creepin'
These dudes be cheatin'
They try to catch you when you sleepin'
It ain't no secret
They send a text and then delete it
You'll never see it
They'll have you all up in your feelings
I know the feelin'

I want someone that's really into me
But not if it ain't meant for me
There ain't no point in rushin' things
'Cause when it happens when it's meant to be

I'll wait for you (You, you)
For you
I'd wait a lifetime, for a lifetime
Night time is the right time
Need you like a lifeline, yeah
I'll wait for you
Yeah
You might also like
I think about you more than I let on
But I'm scared of givin' up the way that I been on
I'm bein' real that don't even think I've even met you yet
Baby if you put me first I'll never second-guess
These dudes are greasy
These dudes are greedy
They'll have their cake and wanna eat it
Don't need a reason
They all the same, they all deceivin'
It's so fatiguin'
See it all, I'm undefeated
A winnin' season

I want someone that's really into me
But not if it ain't meant for me
There ain't no point in rushin' things
'Cause when it happens when it's meant to be

I'll wait for you (You, you)
For you
I'd wait a lifetime, for a lifetime
Night time is the right time
Need you like a lifeline, yeah
I'll wait for you (You, you)
Yeah
And I know I get impatient (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I've got high expectations (High)
So I'll wait for you

I'll be waiting for you (You, you)
For you
Hey
I'd wait a lifetime, for a lifetime
Night time is the right time
Need you like a lifeline, yeah
I'll wait for you (You, you)
