Just in the Central Time zone
I used to kill hours to meet her on time
And then lost one as well drivin' home
Mexican boy on Doheny
SeIlin' a map to stars' homes
Maybe he's homeless
And maybe they're gone
And the afternoon traffic rolls on
Driving a Jaguars impressive
But you can't watch it go by
And the Manhattan skyline is a sight to behold
But prob'ly best through New Jersey-based eyes
It is what it is and that's all
What are you going to do?
Will some fool look up on a clear day and say
"That the sky's not a true enough blue?"
It never much rains, but it's pouring
Everything happens at once
Flat tires and light bulbs while picture frames fall
From the wall where they've hung fine for months
You might also likeIt is what it is and that's all
Lay down a mat by the door
Will some fool rush in from a cloud burst and say
"Hell, I'm soaked and I'm totally bored?"
Out there by the interstate the duplex I call home
Ain't quite the quietest place on earth to catch your breath
Non-stop highway sound makes backyard picnics out to lunch
Fact is my next-door neighbor's fine completely deaf
Maybe you wish you had money
Then you might think you could live
Life is so brief you may think time a thief
Better live for whatever it gives
Pondering the future, you worry
Listen, somehow you'll get through
Then you'll look backwards and long for the things
That you'll find it's then too late to do
It is what it is and that's all
When are you going to see?
Friends tell you true and your granddad did, too
But you won't take advice that comes free
Get what you want you don't want it
Not even glad while you eat
Wait for your flight, while the heavyweights fight
And the planes try to land in the sleet
It is what it is and that's all
And birds can't row boats, baby blue
Will some fool sit stuck on the runway and say
"Hell, it's only me this happens to?"
It is what it is and that's all
