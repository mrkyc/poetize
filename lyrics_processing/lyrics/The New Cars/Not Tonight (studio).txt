But it's working like a charm
It's easy to imagine
Walking you on my arm ... on my arm
I wanna show you around the sights
But not tonight
I like the outfit you're wearing
I like the way that you think
I'd like to call us a cab and take you out for a drink
Wait Wait
I wanna take you for a little bite
But not tonight
No No
I'd like to have a chance to treat you right
But not tonight
I could squeeze you in
But my dance card is full
Still I might change plans
If you give a little (Ahh) Just a little pull
I hear you have a reputation
They say you like to move fast
They say that you don't give a damn
About the price of your gas (That's a gas)
So we can drive until the early light
But not tonight
You might also likeNo No ... I think I have a chance to treat you right
But not tonight
I could make some calls
Move things around
And cancel stuff
But your a long long road
I must go down
One night is not enough
I could squeeze you in
But my dance card is full
Still I might change plans
If you give a little (Ahh) a little ... give a little more
So put me in your Blackberry
And I'll take your E-mail
And we'll meet when the time is right
But not tonight
We're gonna drive till the early light
But not tonight
No not tonight
We're gonna raise a glass
But not tonight
We're gonna burn up gas
But not tonight
We're gonna dine and dance
But not tonight
We're gonna take the chance
But not tonight
We're gonna scandalize
But not tonight
We're gonna see the sunrise
But not tonight
We're gonna drive till the early light
But not tonight ... No not tonight
