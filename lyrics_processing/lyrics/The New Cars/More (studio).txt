Kicked it out of my bloodstream
But there's nothing I can do
No, there's nothing I can do
I thought I had cut
The infection out of me
But it only grew and grew
And it keeps reminding me
Reminding me of you
I want more
I haven't had enough
I want more
Can't get it out of my brain
I want more
No, I haven't had enough
I haven't had enough
Why can't I have you again?
'Cause it was excellent
Yeah, it was excellent
I thought I had killed
The desire inside me
And I was sure I saw it die
Yes, I could swear I saw it die
You might also likeI'm gonna be sick
If my fix is denied me
And you know the reason why
It was because you said
Because you said goodbye
I want more
I haven't had enough
I want more
Can't get it out of my brain
I want more
No, I haven't had enough
I haven't had enough
'Cause it was excellent
I want more
I haven't had enough
I want more
Never get you out of my brain
I want more
No, I haven't had enough
I haven't had enough
This desire I can't defend
Into the darkness I descend
And this anguish just won't end
When can I be with you
Be with you again?
It was excellent
Yes, it was excellent
And my lust can't be restrained
For your scent drives me insane
And what humanity remains
Deep within the heart of me just screams
The heart of me just screams
I want more
I haven't had enough
I want more
Can't get it out of my brain
I want more
No, I haven't had enough
I haven't had enough
'Cause it was excellent
I want more
I haven't had enough
I want more
Never get you out of my brain
I want more
No, I haven't had enough
I haven't had enough
'Cause it was excellent
I want more
Yeah, 'cause it was excellent
