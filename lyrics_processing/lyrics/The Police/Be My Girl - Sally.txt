I was blue and lonely
I couldn't sleep a wink
And I could only get unconscious
If I'd had too much to drink
There was somehow, something wrong somewhere
And each day seemed grey and dead
The seeds of desperation were growing in me head
I needed inspiration, a brand new start in life
Somewhere to place affection, but I didn't want a wife
And then by lucky chance, I saw in a special magazine
An ad that was unusual, the like I'd never seen
Experience something different with our new imported toy
She's loving, warm, inflatable, and a guarantee of joy
She came all wrapped in cardboard
All pink and shriveled down
A breath of air was all she needed
To make her lose that frown
I took her to the bedroom
And pumped her with some life
And later, in a moment, that girl became my wife
And so I sit her in the corner, and sometimes stroke her hair
And when I'm feeling naughty, I blow her up with air
She's cuddly and she's bouncy, she's like a rubber ball
I bounce her in the kitchen, and I bounce her in the hall
And now my life is different since Sally came my way
I wake up in the morning and have her on a tray
She's everything they said she was and I wear a permanent grin
And I only have to worry in case my girl wears thin
