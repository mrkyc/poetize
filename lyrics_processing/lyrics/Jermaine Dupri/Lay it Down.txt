So So Def
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh
Ohh

You need somebody to lay it dawn
Grab you by the your hair and show you exactly where to go
Lay it down
Don't stop, movie it fast
Tap that ass, I say nigga take it slow
Lay it down
Talk to ya, walk witch ya, through every single motion
Lay it down
I mean all the way down, leave a playa like you wide open
Ohh

No I never had that before, so if you out here that's what I'm lookin' fo'
'Cause I keep gettin' these girls, but know
In the G I try to tell 'em what to do but they don't listen to me
I'm good on top
 That's what they say
 I wanna do it in your drop
 That's what they say
 I bet I'll make you say stop
 That's what they say
See Jermaine Dupri LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also likeOnes you get 'em in the sack there won't be none of that
It be a hole lotta action away, hole lotta'  action, not enough play
For this boy "J"
What I need in my life is a wife that have the house jumpin'
Like the gentlemen's club on Monday night
When I come home, hunny doin' tricks
Shit, backflips, (?)  like song
Meet me at the door with the double G
Sayin' "If your free!"

 You gotta drop slooow, now fast
 Bounce that ass
 Get up!
 (?) get cash
 Like this?
 Like that

Like this and uh
Throw it at me like a picture when I give it to ya
Considering your appearance, under the influence
(?)
All I'm herein' is rumors "How she can make ya hotter"
 Let her tell it
 Ohh
 And she crazy with her mouth Peace
 If you let her tell it
 Was to lay you, they gonna lay you down
But im a gangster, G's don't get turned out
I heartbreak 'em like Jay-Z

See I dun it all

Wait
And im'a keep doin' it, baby that's just me
I don't cuddle in the linin', I couple up women
Enough of huddlin' in the linin', they lovein' the thug up in 'em
And yea I know I'm sinin', but it feel like Heaven
All of 'em keep yellin'


No, I never had that before, oh no
I never had that, ohh
No, I never had that before (so if you out here, that's what I'm lookin' fo')
Ohh no, I never had that before
Oh no, I never had that, ohh
No I never had that before (so if you out here that's what I'm lookin' fo')
