I been watchin' you so damn long
But I don't know what to say or do
I be sittin' around fantasizin
Bout what I wanna do to you
It's something about the way you move
Your body, I can't take
Specially when you turn around
And you make you ass shake
You the number one most requested
In the club like one of my jams
But no matter what, when I come in
You're right here where I am
Breakin it down like me in bed
Got a nigga spittin' up all his bread
Bendin over to the front
Lookin' back at me like what you want

I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, some way
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, someway
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do

Shit if that's the case baby, what's it gon take
For us to get it jumped off right now? (Right now?)
I got checkbooks, credit cards, all that shit
Just tell me how it's gotta go down
Now usually I ain't gotta trick but I will though ('Kay)
'Cause you, super bad and for real though ('Kay)
Ooh can't wait for my lips to kiss your lips, both sets
But you don't hear me though, hear me though (Ooh yes)
You can splurge with the credit cards
Even drive my cars all up and down the boulevard
I ain't full of talk, girl, I'm from college park
I can't lie, you make a nigga wanna hit it raw
Is you with it, ma? Don't stop get it, y'all
Down by the law let me take you out this titty bar
Here is my number, yes, hope that I get a call
I gotta getcha, getcha, run up in them sugar walls

I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, some way
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, someway
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gots ta getcha, no matter what it takes
I gots ta getcha and I won't make no mistakes
Baby, I gots ta getcha like I told you before
I gots ta getcha, please believe me for sure

I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
