Wednesday 8:20p.m
Jermaine!!!!!, where are you?
Oh God, God, mo' bitches
You know I'm getting real sick of all these slutty ass bitches
I'm about sick of these dumb motherfuckers on bullshit
Well, you know bitches be playin' too many games you know
We don't play no games
Man fuck niggas all you dumb motherfuckers trip

Now playas don't you hate when the girl try to make you wait
When you know deep down she wanna get down
But she keep talking you to death and playing around
Now ladies (Huh?)
Don't you hate
When a nigga try try to fuck on the first date
Thinking that we mean yes when we say no
And ain't spent no dough
Nigga all that's got to go
See Jermaine Dupri LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
It's funny how niggas get a bitch bent
And wanna fuck 'til their stiff dick get limp
Gotta pay for my shit, my rent, my six
Love me like I love the dough with interest
I don't flush with no broke nigga, regardless
If it's hard then it start spinnin'
Keep me grinning
With phat shit
We can fuck 'til the springs
Pop on the mattress
The fact is I'm a fly bitch
I show that
You motherfuckers would love to hit it and Brat know that
Some of y'all give head too quick in the bed too quick
First think of them chips
Bitch if he leave you could still breathe
Through the week with a few G-Stacks easy
If it's me you wanna get at I'm Brid-at
Invest in some pussy ass that's phit-at


Now it's funny how bitches get a nigga bent
Trying to act so god damn innocent
Wit all that shit y'all put us through
And y'all know you want it as bad as we do
I'm one of the few that can see through shit
I don't do shit 'til we do shit, rich bitch
So the trickin ain't nothing
And if I trick somebody fuckin'
Now I'm a playa I show that
And what I do don't stop, know that
See a lot of y'all trick and get got
Not me if I trick I get head on the spot
On the bed, in the drop, on the elevator all the way to the top
See it taste good don't it?
So why the fuck y'all front
When you know you want it

When I need the money I know who to hit
When I make the call you better jump to it
I'm tired of ya'll acting like y'all don't trick
'Cause when I call you jump jump jump to it
