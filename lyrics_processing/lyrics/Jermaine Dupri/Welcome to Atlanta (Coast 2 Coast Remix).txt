After the party, it's the Waffle House (Yeah, uh-huh)
If you ever been here, you know what I'm talkin about (Yeah, uh-huh)
Where people don't dance, all they do is this (Yeah, uh-huh)
And after the original you know what it is (This is the remix!)
Welcome to Atlanta

Remix, it had to go down
I got somethin' else to tell you (Ugh) 'bout the new Motown
Where people don't visit, they move out here
And ain't no tellin' who you might see up in Lenox Square
I don't know about you, but I miss the Freaknik (Ugh)
'Cause that's where my city use to be real sick (C'mon)
People from other cities used to drive for miles
Just to come to get a taste of this ATL style (Ha)
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballinest Player (Uh-huh)
Make my own moves, call me the mayor
Monday night, you know things change with time
Magic City back lookin' like '89
All the homies on the Southside up in the Ritz (Woo)
(Tuesday night) The Velvet Room, same shit
Wednesday, Strokers, I don't go no mo'
'Cause they don't know how to treat you when you come through the do'
(Thursday night) Was Plush but we moved to Fuel
And I be up in the booth drunk, actin' a fool
(Friday night) At Kaya, they still got love
And the Sharkbar be poppin' like it's a nightclub
Saturday, still off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in One Tweezy
Sunday, gettin' me some sleep (Please)
I'm on my way to the Dec' to hit Jazzy Tee's, holla

Welcome to New York, motherfuckers, where we don't play
And out-of-towners get got like everyday

Tuesday, I'm in Spa, drunk, doin' the shake
And for the rest of the week, we just follow the freaks (Let's go)
You can spot us out of town by the way that we walk
The way that we talk, cocky, the state of New York (That's right)
Hot now top down at the Rucker game
New coupe, no roof, playa, what's my name? (Woo)
Now Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten

New York
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
We still here! And we buildin' four more new towers!
Who say St. Louis ain't hip-hop? Dirty, we hop to what's hip
I'm a Lunatic with too much grip to let us slip
I'm so St. Louis, ask my tattooist
I was like "The Waterboy," now they sayin, "You can do it!"
I'm Baby Huey, one of the best in the Louie
Sip Louis, smoke louie, dressed in Louis
Home of back porches, Chucks, and Air Forces
Old-school cars be trailblazin' like Portland
The girls are the best like Travis with fat asses
I call 'em "gimme girls," they always tell me I can have it
All got habits, marijuana to static
By two cats and coats with automatics (Rrrah)
St. Louis, the Truth like Sojourner (Wha)
Don't need a burner we learn from Ike Turner (Wha)
I tried to told ya don't cross that bridge (Wha)
Without permission from the St. Lunatics

Yo, yo, yo, yo

He just came from off tour
And he wanna tell y'all a little bit about where he come from

Palm trees, bad bitches and wannabes (Uh-uh)
O.G.'s like me eatin' on pollaseeds
Now and Laters, jellybeans, and Wallabees
Real niggas from the set I hardly ever seen (Yeah)
Mostly heard, sell a bird off the cizzurb
And when we dip, we hop and then we swizzerve (Woo)
A lot of homies like to wear the pizzerm
Hair longer than hers, sharp with the fizzur (Haha)
Doggy Dizzogg, you know I like to bizzall

Long Beach is on the motherfuckin map
The city by the sea, R.I.P

Crank up the beat, raise up the heat
I'm throwin' a block party on 2-1 Street, fo' sho'
Welcome to Atlanta remix, hey

Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin'
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play

Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin'
