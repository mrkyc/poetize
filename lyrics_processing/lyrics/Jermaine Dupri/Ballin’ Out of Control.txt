Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Don Chi Chi (that's me)
Rollin wit'cha nigga Nate D
You know these niggas straight bang
Big J.D. - ballin with the 21st street
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Don Chi Chi (that's me)
Still makin tight ass beats
I'm rollin in my brougham, I stay sweet
Ain't nobody ballin like me

It goes, mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the biggest baller of all
I got a 700, a Bentley, and imagine
The girls just die when I'm ridin past
Live life like I'm sellin pies
All Arabian, with two or three wives
Two or three houses to hide
Ten cars parked outside
And they all got bodies that's wide, follow me
As the Leer jet flies, over Crimson Tides
Four bedroom duplex in the sky
Nickname Lottery, cause I don't stop spendin
When the wheels stop, the chrome keep spinnin
Like the six moon-walkin, shit I ain't talkin
I'm straight livin it, it's a wonder I ain't shiverin
I'm so frozen and you've been chosen
To roll with me and Nate D-O double G (sing)
See Jermaine Dupri LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
It's five o'clock in the mornin
I've already downed five, I've already downed five Mo's
See ya around my block on the weekend
All we do is chase bad, all we do is chase bad hoes
Pass me the weed if it's chronic
If not then I just say no, then I just say no
Three girls a date, that's my limit
We ballin outta control, really ballin outta control-ol

Now whether you like me or not, whenever I drop
You know I give you number one hits platinum hot
It's so much clarity in my rocks, I'm thinkin like
It's gotta be somebody greater, maybe it's not
Cause I flow for those who get that dough
Hits for every chick with a size C tit
See it's like this, I don't mind wavin at you kids
But I can't manage to raise my wrist
Jewels so heavy, y'all fools ain't ready
My twenty-twos chop the streets into confetti
Move like Andretti, redlinin
Whatever city I'm in, headlinin
At five a.m. I'm still lookin for mo'
Still gettin crunk, still lettin it flow
Bar outta Cris' now I'm drinkin Mo'
Stomach upset, I feel like I'm about to let it go
It's five o'clock in the mornin
Got my pedal to the flo', got my pedal to the flo'
It's time I test my 600
Wonder how fast this bitch go, wonder how fast this bitch go
Three girls and two of 'em sleepin
One got her hands on my balls, one got her hands on my balls
Sun's comin up, we still drinkin
We ballin outta control, really ballin outta control-ol

Dance, everybody
And everbody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
Everybody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
And everybody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
Everybody just clap ya hands
