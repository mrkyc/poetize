I been watchin' you so damn long
But I don't know what to say or do
I be sittin' around fantasizin
Bout what I wanna do to you
It's something about the way you move
Your body, I can't take
Specially when you turn around
And you make you ass shake
You the number one most requested
In the club like one of my jams
But no matter what, when I come in
You're right here where I am
Breakin it down like me in bed
Got a nigga spittin' up all his bread
Bendin over to the front
Lookin' back at me like what you want

I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, some way
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, someway
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do

And it don't matter if that's ur bitch wit'cha
Cause my man's here too so let's switch up
And we be lookin' at each other get the picture
And my body not Beyonce' but big girls we been holdin' it down
And light-skin used to be way in but brown-skin is tha hot shit now
And don't take me as a one-hit wonder keep me hangin' out on the show
Ya betta act like I'm tha real deal and real bitches I'm tha last one left
Might not see me up in a thong but I'll be rockin' my addais suit
Ur chick can put a tight dress on but she still won't look this cute

I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, some way
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, someway
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do

Shit if that's the case baby, what's it gon take
For us to get it jumped off right now? (Right now?)
I got checkbooks, credit cards, all that shit
Just tell me how it's gotta go down
Now usually I ain't gotta trick but I will though ('Kay)
'Cause you, super bad and for real though ('Kay)
Ooh can't wait for my lips to kiss your lips, both sets
But you don't hear me though, hear me though (Ooh yes)
I wanna splurge wit' ur credit cards
Let me drive your car all up and down the boulevard
Ain't fittin' to talk playa go do ya part
Yeah I like your southern draw might let ya eat it raw
Is ya really hard don't stop get it ya'll
Down by law let me take ya to the titty bar
These chicks ain't shit I mean none of ya'll
Come on get it get it run up in the sugar bars

I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, some way
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
Someday, someway
I gotta getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
