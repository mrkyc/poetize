Um, this Don Chi Chi person that you call yourself?

Uh huh

What is he all about?
Does that mean that you could be devoted to one woman
And have others, or does that mean you're not devoted at all?

Don Chi Chi basically is a glamorous
Fly-assed playboy that's just, you know
He ain't no one-woman type man

I can't wait
It's me again
Uh, what chu waitin' for?
Trina and Tammy, So So Def, c'mon

Take a trip and dip back to my crib
I wanna lay you down

That everyday you live
That you could spend your life with me (Yeah)
