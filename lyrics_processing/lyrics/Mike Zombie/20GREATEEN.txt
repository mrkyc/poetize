Okay let's get this shit started (uh)
It's ZO the dearly departed
It's the producer that did it when y'all niggas said that I wouldn't be an artist (uh)
Fuck it, I'm pretty accomplished (uh)
Two years since I dropped so they starving (uh)
Lack of the zombie got them wilding all up in the comments like, "when you gon' drop it" (huh)
Yup and I'm sorry you waited up
I'm still in the hood like a cranium
Yup and I put that on mommas
I'm bout to come with the bombers (uh)
I'll buy the bar then I'll raise it up
I'm jumping right out the gymnasium
Fuck being humble and modest (uh)
I am the best, to be honest
Long nights in the basement
Tryna get this shit and I was winging it
And now I'm living it this shit is different
It ain't no me and them, you know the difference
I put my niggas in position when it's lit
And then don't act like I did it for them
I think it's safe to say that I'm the realest In it
And I don't give a fuck, I'm burning all my bridges, like
