You could get away with murder when you've got eyes that blue
Nobody ever deserves you, that's what your mama told you
You think every girl you meet is losing sleep about you later
And you look in the mirror like you're doin' it a favor

I know you really dig yourself
Think the world would end without you
Baby, don't you kid yourself
Not everything's always about you
If you could, you'd probably kiss yourself
You're the star of your own show
I know you really dig yourself
So much, why don't you dig yourself a hole?
You can go all the way to China
But I don't know if you'll ever find ya
Someone who loves you as much as you

Yeah, I thought I found a keeper in a tight t-shirt
But then I dug a little deeper and all I found was dirt
Boy, I'm just so over how you overcompensate
You think that you're so fly, so fly away

I know you really dig yourself
Think the world would end without you
Baby, don't you kid yourself
Not everything's always about you
If you could, you'd probably kiss yourself
You're the star of your own show
I know you really dig yourself
So much, why don't you dig yourself a hole?
You can go all the way to China
But I don't know if you'll ever find ya
Someone who loves you as much as you
You might also like
You think every girl you meet is losing sleep about you later
And you look in the mirror like you're doin' it a favor

I know you really dig yourself
Think the world would end without you
Baby, don't you kid yourself
Not everything's always about you
If you could, you'd probably kiss yourself
You're the star of your own show
I know you really dig yourself
So much, why don't you dig yourself a hole?
You can go all the way to China
But I don't know if you'll ever find ya
Someone who loves you as much as you

You can go all the way to China
But I don't know if you'll ever find ya
