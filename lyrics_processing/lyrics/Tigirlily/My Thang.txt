Coffee in my cup spillin' on my shirt
Barely making rent or killing it at work
Oh shit or okay (Okay)
It's gonna be a good day
Top of the shelf or cheap margaritas
Break all my dreams, I'll pick up the pieces
Decline all my Visas
I'm still banking on me 'cause I'ma keep doing my thang

Come shine, come rain
Whatever the weather, I'ma keep doing my thang
Come love, come pain
Never or forever, you know it don't really matter
If you like it or not, hate it, so what?
I don't really like to fake it or lie
You do you and I'll do me
Whatever that means, I'ma keep doing my thang

Swept off my feet, swiping on Tinder
27th dress or diamond on my finger
Feeling pretty or pretty ugly
I'm still gonna love me
Yeah, I want kids, but I'm good with nieces
Break all my heartstrings, I'll pick up the pieces
Boys are my weakness
So help me Jesus, I'ma keep doing my thang

Come shine, come rain
Whatever the weather, I'ma keep doing my thang
Come love, come pain
Never or forever, you know it don't really matter
If you like it or not, hate it, so what?
I don't really like to fake it or lie
You do you and I'll do me
Whatever that means, I'ma keep doing my thang

It don't matter if I'm famous
Or you don't know what my name is
If I'm sitting on your playlist
Or you're 'bout to change it, I'ma keep doing my thang

Come shine, come rain
Whatever the weather, I'ma keep doing my thang
Come love, come pain
Never or forever, you know it don't really matter
If you like it or not, hate it, so what?
I don't really like to fake it or lie
You do you and I'll do me
Whatever that means, I'ma keep doing my thang
I'ma keep doing my thang
It don't matter if I'm famous
Or you don't know what my name is
If I'm sitting on your playlist
I know you didn't change it
