Everything's in but my intuition

Don't wanna kiss you, baby
But I'm gonna kiss you, baby
Sometimes, the thing you want is not what you need
Don't wanna kiss you, baby

But every time you give me that look
You make me want you

Doesn't matter if you're bad for me, yeah
Got me caught up in your gravity
Ooh, I'm just emotionally driven, you're driving
Me to do things that I wouldn't
I think I'm falling, but I shouldn't
It's what I know, but I don't wanna listen
Everything's in but my intuition
Intuition

Telling me, "Bite the apple"
Tempting me like the devil
I don't know how I know but I know, and it's written in red
Don't go and bite the apple
You might also like
But every time you give me that look
You make me want you

Doesn't matter if you're bad for me, yeah
Got me caught up in your gravity
Ooh, I'm just emotionally driven, you're driving
Me to do things that I wouldn't, yeah
I think I'm falling, but I shouldn't
It's what I know, but I don't wanna listen
Everything's in but my intuition

Everything's in, everything's in, oh
Everything's in, everything's in, oh-oh-oh

Can't be blamed for decisions
When I'm not the one who makes 'em
Doesn't matter if you're bad

Doesn't matter if you're bad for me, yeah
Got me caught up in your gravity
Ooh, I'm just emotionally driven, you're driving
Me to do things that I wouldn't
I think I'm falling, but I shouldn't
It's what I know, but I don't wanna listen
Everything's in but my intuition
It's what I know, but I still don't listen
Everything's in but my intuition
Everything's in, everything's in, oh
Everything's in, everything's in, oh-oh
Everything's in, everything's in, oh
Everything's in, everything's in, oh
It's what I know, but I don't wanna listen
