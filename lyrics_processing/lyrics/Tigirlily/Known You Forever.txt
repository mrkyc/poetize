When you get your heart broke or catch a big break
When you're on top of the world or flat on your face
When you got a problem you can't fix, you pick up the phone, it's a real short list
Of the friends you call that do it all, have always been there

Sometimes you gotta fly with birds of a feather
Sometimes it takes one to know one
Can't replace all the time spent together
Sometimes it's nice to have someone
Who will cry with you when you're cryin'
Call you out when you're lyin'
You think you know you but they know you better
Sometimes you need someone who's known you forever

They know where I stand 'cause they've been in my shoes
They know all my dirt 'cause we've got the same roots
A million people here in the city, but it's the ones back home that really get me
So tonight I'm rollin' back to the beginnin'

Sometimes you gotta fly with birds of a feather
Sometimes it takes one to know one
Can't replace all the time spent together
Sometimes it's nice to have someone
Who will cry with you when you're cryin'
Call you out when you're lyin'
You think you know you but they know you better
Sometimes you need someone who's known you forever
You might also like
Still know their home phone number by heart
They'll be there in the end 'cause they were from the start

Sometimes you gotta fly with birds of a feather
Sometimes it takes one to know one
Can't replace all the time spent together
Sometimes it's nice to have someone
Who will cry with you when you're cryin'
Call you out when you're lyin'
You think you know you but they know you better
Sometimes you need someone who's known you forever

Known you forever

Known you forever
Hey-hey
Known you forever
