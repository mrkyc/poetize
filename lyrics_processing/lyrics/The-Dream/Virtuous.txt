What you wanna be huh? A wife or a girlfriend?
Ready for a lifetime or fucking on the weekends?
What we gonna be? Classy? Trashy?
The bedroom or the backseat?

Girls know they love all that nasty shit
Girls know they love it when they shit get licked
We fuck, we pray, she classy
But she don't fuck with a Benz if it's class C
Uh, she don't even care
She said them good girls need a bad boy, so I made that my career
And she ain't got no fears
She makes it crystal clear
Baby, I'm the one that needs saving
My girl lit and she stay on it
She in the mirror going crazy
She in the mirror going crazy

Fucking with me 'cause of what she see not 'cause what she get
Send shorty on her way if I don't benefit
If I don't benefit
The game done changed, got my change up, winning
Still the same lil nigga
That get you high as a peak and fuck you to sleep
She know I ain't nothing like them other niggas
I'm that young nigga that can make you cum quicker
Smoking Mary Jane, put you on some hard liquor
Long dick her, you scream so loud, they think something's wrong with you
I don't want no problems, I just want some pussy
You just sucked me off, why you tryna kiss me?
Get so fuckin' high, only God can judge me
The way I dick 'em down, all my bitches love me

We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me
We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me
We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me

Adam in that Benz when I roll by
Eve in the motherfuckin' shotgun
You'll always be a virgin in my eyes
And I just wanna hold something wholesome
As you feed me another lie, feed me another lie
I would have ate it anyway, don't apologize
I'm hellbent on you, our virtues run loose
Our love still holds true, we can't hit undo

We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me
We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me
We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me
We are who we are, we are who we are
Only God can judge me

We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me
We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me
We are who we are, who we are, who we are
Only God can judge me
