She rode the beat like a pony
Cameras up, cameras flash

As we rock to the left, rock to the right
Lend me your body, I'ma rock it all night
Don't leave us on this floor, shorty
The door's to the left, I'm parked on the right
Tell my niggas, "Holler back," tell your girls, "Goodnight"

The way you're rocking that up in this club
I swear you're gonna make a nigga fall in love, love
The way you're rocking that up in this club
