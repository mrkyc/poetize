Rock to the beat for ya boy (Ayy, Dream, let me tell you bout shorty)
Radio killa, killa, killa

Shawty is the sh-sh-sh-sh
Sugar honey iced tea
Prettiest one I see
Little mama icy
They say she a Pisces
I heard they are feisty
You know how to treat her, she'll be sweeter than a Hi-C
Clean up very nicely, shoes are kinda pricey
Match 'em up precisely, good jean, nice tee
Like her food spicy
And she is the same
Hotter than a flame, but I do not know her name
Is it Keisha?
Is it Tisha?
Maybe Lisa?
Or Teresa?
It could be Tia
Maybe Aaliyah
I guess I'll find out one day
For now I'ma say (Ayy)

Hard as rock when she touched me
Thinkin' now if she would've loved me
