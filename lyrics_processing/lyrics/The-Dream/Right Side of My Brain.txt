Ugh, fell in love
With a real heartbreaker
I'm so sorry
And there's nothing I can do
To shake her
Oh, oh
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's not you; it's me
Oh, oh
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Breaker
I still love you
Oh, oh
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Can't shake her
Yah, ah

You touch me, baby
Then you untouch me, baby
You feed me your lies
Words like pie
You want me, baby
Then you unwant me, baby
Outsmart me, baby
Now, I'm all crazy
You might also like
But I should be ashamed, 'cause I
Let you do me this way, and it's
Unfortunate that when you're in love
You never use

The right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brai-ay-ain

You love me, baby
Unlove me, baby (Unloved me, babe)
You led me on
Lock the doors on love's home
You heart me, baby
Then you hardly, baby
You need me, baby
Then, you send me gone
You'll say I'm your friend (Friend)
Up until the end (Yeah, ah, ah, ah)
When you tell it, baby (Oh)
You know how to sell it baby, don't you?
But I should be ashamed, 'cause I
Let you treat me this way, can't lie
Unfortunate to say that love
Never lets me use

The right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of your brain (Ayy)
Right side of my (Yeah, ahh)

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh, ho-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, ahh
You love me, baby (You love me, baby)
Unlove me, baby (Unlove me, baby)
Let me be (Ah-oh)
Set me free (Lately, you've, oh)
You're near me, baby (Ah, oh)
But not nearly, baby (Not near)
You saying I'm your friend (Ayy)
Then why we at the end?

But I should be ashamed, 'cause I
Let you do me this way, and I
Known all this time
I should've been using

The right side of my brain (Ayy)
Right side of my brain (Ayy)
Right side of my brain (Ayy, oh, whoa)
Right side of my brain (Ayy)
The right side of my brain (Ayy)
Right side of my brain (Ayy, oh, no)
Right side of my brain (Ayy, oh, no)
Right side of my brain (Ayy)
Right side of my

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh (Whoa)
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh (Whoa, whoa)
Whoa-oh-oh, ho-oh (Oh, oh, oh)
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, ahh (Yeah)

Should've been using
Oh, should've been using

Ooh, should've been u-u-sing
Should've been using
