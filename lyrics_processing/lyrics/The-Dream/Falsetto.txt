Started out talking right here
Putting it down like a motherfucking mack
Selling candy all up in my ear
She wanna be down like the Ds on the Lac
Slow dancing in the club, her diamonds look like rainbows
She grinding on my dick, she looking for the pot of gold
We hop up in that AMG and D, we in the Westin
She putting moves on me, I coulda swore shorty's a wrestler

Calling last night a fluke, actin' like she didn't remember
