No matter how many things I have
No one will ever love me your way
No matter what love invades my space
One thing's for sure, you won't be replaced

If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I've gotta make the song cry
If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
Shit, I guess I've got to make the song cry

It hurts me just to see your name
And that tattoo runs right through my veins
My sister misses you the same
And it hurts me cause I know she just can't say
And what I would give to see your face (yeah)
Wherever you are I pray you're safe (yeah)
Forgive me for my selfish ways (yeah)
For I know that you're better off these days (yeah)

Baby I miss you, every time it rains
And no matter how bright the sun may shine
It never dries away the pain
Singin' ohhh ohhh. Ohhh ohhh
Singin' ohhh ohhh. Ohhh ohhh
You might also like
And you're written all over me
So much so, I can't believe
Your grandchildren are a sight to see
Every day they're more of you, and less of me
And what a cliche
I know you hear
No fear, I know you're near
And no matter how many things I have
No one will ever love me your way
No matter what love invades my space
One thing's for sure, you won't be replaced

Baby I miss you, every time it rains
And no matter how bright the sun may shine
It will never dry away this pain
And I'm singin' ohhh ohhh. Ohhh ohhh
And I'm singin' ohhh ohhh. Ohhh ohhh

If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I've got to make the song cry
If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
Shit, I guess I've got to make the song cry
Mama I miss you, every time it rains
No matter how bright the sun may shine
It will never dry away this pain
And I'm singin' ohhh ohhhh. Ohhhhh ohhhh
And I'm singin' ohhh ohhhh. Ohhhhh ohhhh
