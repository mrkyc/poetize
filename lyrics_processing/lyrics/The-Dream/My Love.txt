Did a song with the American Dream, uh (American Dream)
They can't put it down like this, no no no no
On my baby, she my shawty
(Ooh, we rockin')
They gotta trip all up on their breath
They hate on us (Ooh, we rockin')

Now who's right there every time you cry?
Gonna sleep and wake up on your side?
Endless love I'll always provide
They hatin' on us and you should know why

But who's be lovin' you lately?
Who's willing to go half on the baby?
Who who who's trying to flag our ship?
They just tryin' to get the love you give, but baby

Tell me what they know about my love (my love)

Here to stay and they going bye, bye
