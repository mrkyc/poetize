Looking for light in the darkness is something for fools
Searching for hope in a hopeless time but now I'm through
Because I know I have something inside
To keep me from stumbling over my pride
And I'm dying to believe

But now that it went away I thought it would end all today
And I can feel the fight deep inside me giving way
And I don't wanna give in but it's getting really hard
To give it all away, nothing's coming back to me

There was once a time
When everything seemed fine
Now I'm going back again
To this picture perfect place of mine

I won't believe something's wrong when I know that it's true
And I know I can't lose a thing if there's nothing to lose
Nothing will keep me from chasing my dreams
And I will not give up on all of these things
That I'm trying to achieve
You might also like
But now that it went away I thought it would end all today
And I can feel the fight deep inside me giving way
And I don't wanna give in but it's getting really hard
To give it all away, nothing's coming back to me

There was once a time
When everything seemed fine
Now I'm going back again
To this picture perfect place of mine


But now that it went away I thought it would end all today
And I can feel the fight deep inside me giving way
And I don't wanna give in but it's getting really hard
To give it all away, nothing's coming back to me

There was once a time
When everything seemed fine
Now I'm going back again
To this perfect place of mine
Dying before my eyes
I reach to make it mine
And now I'm going back again
