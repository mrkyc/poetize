It starts with pain
Followed by hate
Fueled by the endless questions no one can answer
A stain covers your heart
And tears you apart
Just like a sleeping cancer

Now i don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved
How did you get here, and when did it start?
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart

What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate?
Losing control of our feeling
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold

Are you sane?
Where's the shame?
A moment of time passes by
You cannot rewind
Who's to blame, and where did it start?
Is there a cure for your sickness?
Have you no heart?

I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved
How did you get here, and when did it start?
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart

What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate?
Losing control of our feeling
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our souls for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold

There's a sickness inside you that wants to escape
It's a feeling you get when you can't find your way
So how many times must you fall to your knees
Never, never, never, never,  never do this again!

It starts with pain (it starts with pain)
Followed by hate (followed by hate)
Now i don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved

What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate?
Losing control of our feeling
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our souls for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
