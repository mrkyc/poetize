Look
No more pain ma
I know I put you through some stuff
But I hope you know this ain't your fault ma
And I love you for life ma
This is for you I love you forever
Trust me, look

Have you ever met a judge and had to fight for your life?
Took the challenge on my own and looked the devil in his eyes
I saw red, I saw rage, I saw things I can't say
And I wanna diss him bad but it's burning me inside
But I feel it for my mum the most
She's a real G
Stood strong when her son got a guilty
Look me in my eyes and said "that's not the real me"
I told her I know but only you is gonna heal me
You feel me? Never own me nothing your protected
Even though I'm gone I know I'll never be neglected (accepted)
Me against them I'll be selected
Forever respected
I'll always respect you
I'll have to, I'm meant to I'll never get a next you
I'll always see the best you
Even in the visit hall you step through
Dressed to a T, -big smile on your face
Even though this is nowhere near the best view
Her son's in the Dock
While she is in the court well
Looking through the window while I walk back to my court cell
Month's on a shit trial
Beefing with shit yutes
Broke n**  told em take the wrap they Tryna slip through
Ever sign a deal on a visit
I'm the first to
I'm sorry ma i didn't wanna listen and it hurt you
I went and caught a bird flu
Tryna make this bird fly, i'm G'd up
Couldn't give a fuck about a Birth-sign
Never chose the street shit
Could've been a baller, can't believe it
Had to spin the block and go and sweep it
When i took a free kick
Top corner, kept the celebration on a G shit
You ever met a G star?
Mum this is Jayden not SJ on your speaker
I'm your same son with my voice a little deeper
Mum this ain't your fault, you was perfect as a teacher
Only blame myself but I do this for Tanisha
It's a crazy world
I was your baby boy, now you got a baby girl
Everytime I rap they have to pay me well
This is for my mum so who cares if they make it sell (i don't give a-)
I don't give a fuck if they give it views
Deeper than a track
It's a message that i give you
A story that they wanna hear , feeling that they wanna know
I don't know your thought's but i know you never let it go
Mummy it's a long road, truss it's gonna get cold
Check what's in my DNA
Imma merk this race like a G-L-A (huh)
No more pain when i see your face
Just staring at the world like i be in space
Man i really needed space
Happy for the love i get
They trapped me like a Dog and put me in a vet
This sweat box drips all i do is sweat
365 same spot like i'm trynna bet they be really on my neck
You might also likeNo more pain ma
It's not the same but i promise i'm the same ma
They trynna turn your son insane ma
But one day they're gonna have to break the chain ma
Let me out then gates ma
Freedom in my face ma
Love you till i die and that shit will never change ma
I said that shit will never change ma (look)
I said i love you till the graveyard

Hi Jayden we lovee you
