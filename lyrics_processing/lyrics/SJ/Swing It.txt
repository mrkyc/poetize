Ai Ai free the gang, free the gang
Fuck the opps
The new pack on the block, go bill it
Any loose juice, man see, man spill it
Bad B wan' bend her back and dig it
But I wan' bruck this dots and fill it (Bow, Bow)
Get sent south side, no Bagel
Fuck a Bagel, slap corn at your Mac D's
These dumb little opp boys can't at me (Woi)
Try Gun Lean and get shot from the back seat

Swing my shank, aim straight for your head
And if you don't run little boy, you're dead
Fifteen, that was me on the ped
With a shank same size as my age, it's ments
When you rap, best make some sense
No K on the O but there's K's on them
Me, SJ, I can't leave my friends
Best stand your ground and fight 'til death
The new pack on the block, go bill it
Any loose juice, man see, man spill it
Bad B wan' bend her back and dig it
But I wan' bruck this dots and fill it
Everyone knows I'm on chingings
Get the green light, that's bare juice spillin'
In the T house tryna make me a killin'
On this trap ting but I'm full time drillin'
Crash corn, no cars get crashed
One or two times they've crashed it back
Me and O'Sav just splashed him, mad
My broski Lerky is Snaps' dad
This bad B's tellin' me I'm tapped
I'm sorry darlin', I'm rude and bad
In Central London, she holds this shank
But in the Northside, she holds this mash
All these drills I done, I can't talk on them
Cah they're all still a pending case
And I've had man fight for their life on a hospital bed
There's no way you can talk on my name
They don't wanna see me go insane
Man, two man step, one wap, one blade
SJ, I really lost my brain
Man splash man down, bare juice on pave'
I do these chingings all bait
Ask DV cah he saw my face
The way man poked up Snaps
Is the same way man poked Big A
But let me just stop right there
Cah I can't even say more names
Cah I might have feds at my door
Tryna nick me GBH and attempted K's
OFB, we don't do no drills?
That's calm, I can take that one on the chin
Cah if I start talking the tings
Your eyes will open like Lord of the Rings
And guess what? I'm a lord with my ching
But I don't want clout, I ain't touching the wing
But look how many man been chinged
