Aye tweeko mixed this u know, it sounds cold
Yeah Yo, Yeah yo, Yeah yo
Lil rocky
Bullet, bullet, bullet

I dare you put one hand on the gang, I'll knock your lights out with a PR no fist ting (Knock him out)
I ain't ever stole a knife from the kitchen I've always got a fifteen inch for my siblings
Dip him, drill him, attempted killin'
Leave man covered in stitches
Road to riches OFB Villain, chop mans head bare head back spilling
This opp thot on my phone just chatting telling me her boyfriend dont make cash, and I got this next opp thot just chatting telling me her boyfriend just got splashed
Sorry B, I don't know about that I was on the Front Street tryna chase these racks
Four man got touched, dont lack, creep up in flats and take that flat
Man push this work on a pavement, theres a brand new wap on the block and its a big one but don't get mistaken
Come on chop it, chop it same way that boy from the nine got chopped when ravin
You can't shake no legs on my block, pull up on a opp wagwan we sayin?
Then get straight down to the shaving
More time I don't ask no questions
Man pull up jump out and just do it
Canada Goose won't save you back my blade put my blade straight through it
Big man got his rasclart splashed now hes back on the wing and I know hes screwing
Shotgun bark and the shells them chew it, chew him up like chewing gum
Cock it, Cock it, Rise it, Bang it, Aye, I'm a different type of savage
On the road telling me that I lost it, I ain't lost it, I told him I'll manage
And no one ask me if I lack no more running with my rambo is a habit
And bro crash corn on a opp block see him hop scotch, jump up like rabbit
Why they mention the O for clout and then ain't drill no one they're fucking liars
Over there man burn these tires I stop this ped bike twisting wires
OFB dont promote no violence you don't need friends 
But some man will tell me I'm lying some fucking fools gotta chat like the niners
Man see them yutes from a distance skid skur dont press no brakes
I'll rev this 1-2-5 hop off the moped then slap this gauge
Handgun to protect the block cause the shotgun under the car is bait
Hold on bro I'll clock his face jump out ching chang leave man on a pave
I love to get a drop when they raving pull up outside and camp their bait
Try run trip up and get caged, before you step better tie your lace
Fall back and he sees my face approach with caution with hands on waist
This long nose come long like Grace, chop it chop it so it leaves more space
More time I don't ask no questions, Man pull up jump out and just do it
Canada Goose won't save you back my blade put my blade straight through it
Big man got his rasclart splashed now hes back on the wing and I know hes screwing
