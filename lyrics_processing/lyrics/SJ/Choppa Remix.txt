I'm swingin' my blade, tryna do him up proper, choppa
Me, I can't stop for a copper
Making Magic
Let me get my hands on a choppa
Rinse, the clip on your block, tryna drop one
Ay, Slim Typical, I see you
I'm swingin' my blade, tryna do him up proper, choppa
Me, I can't stop for a copper
And if the fed chase gets too crazy
Decamp the car and head straight to the blocka, blocka
Let me get my hands on a choppa
Rinse, the clip on your block, tryna drop one
Waps on the block, yeah, we lost one

Ay, ay, ay, I'm swingin' my blade, tryna do him up proper, choppa
Me, I can't stop for a copper (No way)
And if the fed chase gets too crazy
Decamp the car and head straight to the blocka, blocka (To the block)
Let me get my hands on a choppa
Rinse, the clip on your block, tryna drop one (Bow, bow)
Waps on the block, yeah, we lost one, cop ones
On the opp block, get the job done (Job done)

Cop it, cop it
Nuttin' ain't changed, still whip it and lock it
Point-32 short, fit in my pocket
If we get a new cup, shit I'mma swap it
I ripped up guys with my kitchen knife
If he trips up nice, I'mma take his life (Take it, take it)
My next-door got life (Yeah, yeah)
Let me break him some rice
He's acting too tough, I grab my toothbrush
I gave him two plus, I'm moving ruthless
The Gov's are Ku Klux, they turn my crew nuts
I feel to complain but they're just useless
Prick Mr Kerry flipped my whole celly
Didn't find nothing, still took my telly (Suck your mudda, pussio)
Come looking for phones but didn't find any
What's nine plus ten? Twenty-one
Grab the bells and load this gun
Hit his headie, I told him "Hold this one" (Su, su, su, su, su)
One (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Purchase, purchase, can't find him, catch his friend and hurt him
BHA caught M2, had to burst him
Two with one, that's me, I'm a virgin
Let me end by saying free S, there's not a lot of real niggas left
Who you with? Where you been?
Who you shot? Who you cheffed?
Put my blade in his skin, bet I rip out your flesh
I'll press in front of the press
If my head get hot, every fuck get kweffed
Try gun lean and get shot from the back seat
Sixty plus points, we the wildest in west
