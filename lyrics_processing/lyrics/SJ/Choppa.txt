Rinse, the clip on your block, tryna drop one
Waps on the block, yeah, we lost one

Or my rambo, gon' rip through guts (Yuck)
They had a K on the O and some joke thing

I'm in the 9 piece and I tape that strip
On the 2 piece, man tape that strip (Tape it up)
On both blocks man take that trip
With direct rules and these rules are strict
Opp boys move low when we come 'round
When we come 'round, they know they're pissed (They're pissed)
And big guns come out when the sun's out
When the sun's down, mans lettin' it rip

Jump out gang out this black Ford Focus
No one can war with the OFB soldiers (No way)
Ten toes or bruck down motors
Tryna move man like sofas
Hocus, pocus, don't try approach us
Wet man down bare blood on loafers (Ching, ching, ching)
My Air Max just turned into Loubs
You should've seen the way man spilt his juice (Oh, no)
That same day I had to burn my shoes
Now I'm in JD trying to cop me two
They see me and they change their route
Any opps that we spot, bro, spin that coupe (Spin it)
This bad B come bad she cute
But she won't hold the mash when she's dead and rude
I'm in the 9 piece tryna rev and go
Today he won't make it home
Man slap this S came straight for domes
Or I back my blade and tear man's coat (Rip it up)
On the glide I don't bring no phones
Just me in the dinger tryna step with smoke (Bow, bow)
Bare man over there can't cope
So they're not in the field, they just stay at home
Internet typers, internet fighters
Let me tell you what the internet does (What it does)
It plays with these good yutes heads
And now these good yutes be thinking they tough (Some dickhead)
Now they got me rolling round in this bruck down Vectra
Trying to turn one of them skunk
