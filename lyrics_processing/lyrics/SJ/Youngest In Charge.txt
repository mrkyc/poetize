Trap House Mob
Ay Mobz, that sounds wavy you know

OFB, we don't window shop
Bro caught him an opp and tried turn him off (Bow, bow)
In this X3, man's swervin' off (Skrr, skrr)
Free Boogie Bando, he got birded off (Free my bro, free my bro)
Whenever we get a burner loss
We just cop a next one and go burst it off (Ay)
Lil bro's tellin' me he got his earnings wrong
We just took him OT, now his trapline's gone (Ring, ring)

Yo, PY got smoked, no bong (Bow, bow, bow)
And I'm tryna smoke man with this trey, no Songz
SJ, I've been a real bad boy from young
I would've had my Rambo if I was allowed in prom (I weren't allowed)
This bad B in the Nizz with thongs
She keeps tellin' me she wants the Niners gone
Bando's tellin' her she can ride along
And if Lz in the cut, this ride gets long (Woi-woi-woi-woi)
Like, everyone's trappin' and everyone's bangin'
I think I might just stop rappin' (I might)
These 9 boys just jumped on a track
K-M-T, who gassed these faggots? (KMT)
They ain't done no blammings or splashings
What are they rappin'? (What they rappin'?)
SJ, I ain't on no chattings
Man been verified, blue ticks, old fashioned (That's old)
And if I start talking 'bout these drills they'll fold up
And this song might get taken down (Oh shit)
And if you've been touched, please own up
King on your block? Let me take that crown (Let me take it)
Man seen armed Jakes at the exit
I asked broski, "Will we make it out?" (Might not)
Oh shit, oh shit, I just see a opp, let me take him out
RIP Lampz, didn't make it out, ouch (Dead up, dead up)
She tryna send man down South
When they stay up north, they get saved like, "How?" (How?)
Them boy are like Mickey Mouse
They just want attention from kids, some clowns (Some dickheads)
They post pics like "drip or drown"
Let me drown mans drip, where's your drip gone now? (Ching, ching, ching)

But she's going down South, will this South ting naughty? (Ohh, ohh)
In the dance, got my Rambz all bleached up
Left the function with my shank all saucy (Ching, ching, ching)
Get sent down South, no Morley
I'm on this Vespa with this rusty .40 (It's rusty)
Ay, naughty, naughty, no one call me
And no Snapchat for the porkies (No Snapin')
This X3 kicks off like a tank
Put your foot on the gas, let's do this neatly (Skrr, skrr)
See the way man poked up DV?
He ran after and all collapsed, that's meady (Oh shit)
Fore Street gets taped off easy
The way I pull up blacked out, you can't see me (No way)
Reaper, I beg you stop these wheelies (Ay, bro)
Opps at Mac D's, let's do this speedy (Ching, ching)
Move low, not bait, bro changed his plates
Broad day, let it rip on the mains (Bow, bow)
Before we leave this place, make sure it gets taped
Take risks on the glide, fuck Jakes (I dare you to take it)
X3, bare space, two boots, let's play
Tryna red card man, no games (Bow, bow, bow)
I see the boys in plain
Don't press no brakes, all bait so we mount that pave' (Skrr, skrr)
