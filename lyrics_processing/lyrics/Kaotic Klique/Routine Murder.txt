It's a routine, scoping busters out with the red beam (Murder)
It's a routine
It's a routine, scoping busters out with the red beam (Murder)
It's a routine
It's a routine, scoping busters out with the red beam (Murder)
It's a routine
It's a routine, scoping busters out with the red beam
Smoking Blue Dream
It's a routine, it's a routine

Fucking around with the demon inside of me
Will he be laying face-down on the earth?
Open the pit into Hades, I know that it's crazy but fuck it, I'm stuck with this curse
Empty hole that is sitting six feet deep, I'm so anxious to toss yo body inside
Covered in dirt, you will turn into earth so your body nobody will ever find
Smoking the blunts that are full of crystals
Try to contain our rage 'cause I got fist-full's
Turn your city into burials, met with Death next to me blood dripping off of his sickle
Just execute you, no need for a trial
Leaving the bodies stacked up into piles
Cover the corpses I've left in the vaults and the gasoline fire will be seen for miles
Ashes from corpses all that will be left
Keep the heart that I ripped out of your chest
Now, I have full control over your soul, it's the last little bit of you left I just
Torch the roommate or you're end of our mission
We're taking lives, we advise you to listen
I give a fuck if your Muslim or Christian
The prophecy labels you all forgiven

Smoking Blue Dream
It's a routine, it's a routine

Demons all up in my head, telling me leave these busters dead
Scoping these ruptures with infrared
Sipping this potion until I can't stand
Now, I'm ready for this thing, pull the mask over my face
Put this Glock up to your dome, have you said your prayers today?
It don't matter, brains gon' splatter
Paint a picture with my cannon
Feel sadistic but autistic, think I'll place you on my canvas (Bloody murder)
I'ma serve 'em like a waiter too, I'm patient too
I'm chasing you forever, realize their love ain't saving you
Now rest, you'll be floating with the spirits soon and I'll be waiting in the pits of hell ready to welcome you
Building up this army, ready to take over the planet
Kaotic Klique, Villaination, things about to get psychopathic
Can you stand it or fall? It's raining blood on you all
These creatures come when they called
And it's our time on earth, so, just bow down now, we are your gods
And we ain't playing no more, it's time to settle the score
I got one question for you, are you bitches ready for war?

Smoking Blue Dream
It's a routine, it's a routine

Psychopathic, schizophrenic, in a rage
Hear demonic voices tell me to blow your brains through the front page
Of the newspaper mane, washing away your remains with the acid rain
Leaving no trace of blood stains in the aftermath (Murder)
It's so coldly calculated, some call it math (Yes)
Multiplying and divide your body parts like a psychopath
I couldn't stop it even though I wanted to
Sick and twisted thoughts coming from the Devil make me do the things I do (Murder)
It's almost like a routine, scoping busters out with the infrared beam
Smoking Blue Dream, itching for a killing like a beam
Popping heads off like I'm popping jelly beans
I'm hungry mane

It's a routine, scoping busters out with the red beam (Murder)
It's a routine
It's a routine, scoping busters out with the red beam (Murder)
