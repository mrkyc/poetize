This anger's making me go blind
Leaving my sanity behind
My suggestion to you is let me be
Or watch blood pour into the sea
The time is coming
Step out of line I promise
There will be blood
Rivers of blood

And you know I'm coming for the crown
Bitch I got the blunt and got the crown
Take another puff and set it down
Shit, comin straight from the underground
What that mean we ain't fuckin with the mainstream
Niggas already know it's the brain team
Niggas thinkin' they sickin cause its the same thing
But me and my niggas really sicker than gangrene
Aim beams, and make a nigga brain leap
I'm poppin uppers and them downers cause i can't sleep
I was broke and now in music I'ma make green
Ain't nobody fuckin' with the regime
Back then I will put the blade through your face G
Make a nigga face bleed you run like a HD
Can't no one replace me I'm the one they can't see
Niggas trippin I'ma hit the chopper like im Beijing
Look at the Brain and the way we own it
I bet that make a pussy nigga hate me don't it
Niggas wolf a keyboard won't save you won't it
Niggas wolfin' out they mouth until my blade be on it
I gotta make it on there but I already did it
I ain't like them other niggas on your television
I keep it real take the message from the metaphysics
Every day a motherfucker gettin' better with it nigga ISO

This anger's making me go blind
Leaving my sanity behind
My suggestion for you is let me be
Or watch blood pour into the sea
And the time is coming
Step out or now I promise
There will be blood
Rivers of blood

Sitting back watching that blood pour, them eyes wide open
See so many things I've never seen before, them blinds wide open
Look into your soul, now we know all the things you did
Watch as we get old, feels like yesterday when we was kids
Hanging, chilling in the park without no cares to give
We just lived for the moment, sing about it then puff a cig, reminisce
Now the world don't feel right
So many changes happen overnight
But I stay true with my real friends, can't stop us, we on overtime
'Bout to take the game, make it my new bitch
I feel it now, man my mind just switched
They could never understand this glitch
They will never understand this Klique
We will bring the flood, the rivers of blood will fall upon you all
Step in the way, never be safe, lost in the grave only place you will fall
This anger's making me go blind
Leaving my sanity behind
My suggestion to you is let me be
Or watch blood pour into the sea
The time is coming
Step out of line I promise
There will be blood
Rivers of blood

I'm a bulldozer headed for your kingdom
You're next on my hitlist now I'm gonna knock walls down
Any person that is standing in the way will be nothing more than a bloodstain, I can't calm down
I know you're feeling yourself, acting cocky than a motherfucker but trust me, I won't stop until I see blood
And your whole team be getting fucked, and I have your whole city looking like ground zero or Hiroshima
You and me are not the same
I pop a handful of pills trying to stop the pain
You can stand on the tracks, I can't stop the train
Trying to build a empire with some pocket change
Standing in the street light trying to talk to God
I'm so sick of street life 'cause I walk the talk
But there ain't no backing down when they going for the crown
Because lately my attitude has been "fuck 'em all"
And we're stopping for no one
My knuckles are bloody from grinding them up 
I'm so sick and barely ever making it by
Trying to provide a life my family needs
So with the resistance there will be rivers of blood in an instant
I advise you to listen, or you and your posse will come up missing
This anger's making me go blind
Leaving my sanity behind
My suggestion to you is let me be
Or watch blood pour into the sea
The time is coming
Step out of line I promise
There will be blood
