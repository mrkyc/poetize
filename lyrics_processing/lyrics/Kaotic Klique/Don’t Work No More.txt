Prayers go unanswered make me worried 'bout burning forever

I sit in this room by myself
No feelings left, it's like I'm numb from the inside out
I wait for death to come in home, so that I can rest
Look in the mirror mane I hardly recognize myself
Grab the bottle from the shelf
Take another swig, now forget all the times you did me wrong
Take this pill, now it's clear, why I'm here
All alone, take for granted times we had
Like they'd always last forever
Thought I knew it all but turns out
That I'm just not that clever
My sense is lost
As the time keeps on passing by
Taking me a purpose but noone can really tell me why
Seven days we're lost, all searching for an answer
We can't find, angels, demons, all they realize to keep us all in line
I don't care, wanna chill, feel the breeze through my hair
Smell the weed in the air, let me know I'm really here
As I'm a zombie, walking dead
Just a project for the feds, experimenting with kids
These pills gonna drop me dead

I hear the storm coming, anxiety within me rises
So used to cold of the darkness taking control inside me
Transparent eyes (eyes), if you look close my soul is frozen
Crying for help, violent silent screams, that are hurting my dome
Only the reaper, it's almost like we're learning together
Prayers go unanswered make me worried 'bout burning forever
Suicidal thoughts top me when I try to think positive
Father, help me, so I don't end up like my grandfather did
This weed is like prozac, I keep fighting plus row fat
Music's my therapy, I hit record hit the whole bag
This xanax will numb me, before evil becomes me
My intentions are beautiful, but my attitude ugly
Product of everlurking, you can tell by my playstyle
I'm sick of always losing this game, that life does not play fair
I break the face of the mold in the life almost blinds me
Trapped in dark for so many years hoping someone will find me
