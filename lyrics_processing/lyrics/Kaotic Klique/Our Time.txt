They don't know what we 'bout to do
We 'bout to take 'em out this game, man it's what we do (that's what we do)
We waited for so long, nothing left for you (left for you)
And yes this is our time, ain't no saving you (ain't no saving you)
They don't know what we 'bout to do

I got my hammer on chrome
The purple bug got me blow
Now when I'm losing my religion
Tell the angels to hold that
I'm a leader, not a follower
I lead them by those hollow ones
Just dropped another kill so bet your ass that I'm 
I drown  rappers on logic in any topic
If you cross Kaotic Klique we guaranteed to get it poppin'
He's the blasphemous, he got's to go
The street, the cloud up on the road
I'll bring the second flood to Earth, but trust me, soon you all will know

Soft soil in the Earth signifies the return
Or if you prefer the saline to burn, an urn
The circle of life ends when inserting a knife in, to sever by slicin' the lifeline, it's so thin
I try to keep it open to let it soak in
First time it wounds, next time a bruise, then you don't even notice
Focus on the pain we place on ourselves
Much worse, than the hurt, when we blame, someone else
But I'm cursed, still a verse, cheers me up, death for the moment
My life's on a note, on loan to the person who owns it
That was so long ago, since I've been on this road and returned that
Cuz when it happens, it's for soul staches and I'm over that

(Fix nigga)
You better take 'em out the game, woulda spit a flame
Pickin' a pen and I'm coming I'm bucking 'em poppin' all my enemies thinking of coming against me
Guaranteed that being murdered, fucking around with Fix and the Kaotic Klique and Spliff and Kaoz and my nigga Gypsy
Tell the suckas to miss me
Ain't nobody can save you, on the daily feeling my demons coming after me
Maybe Imma turn psychotic til they finally put me inside a mental asylum and throw away the key
Cuz I'm outta my mind, lyrical wrecking em and I'm packing a nine
Taking a puff of the pine
Keeping my niggas focused when I'm on the grind
I've been drinking in the truck, it got me with a sign of paranoia
Thinking a motherfucker watching me like all the time
And the reason why might be cuz I'm high
Besides, I ain't worried about a thang cuz I ride for mine
And I signed the line, but the verses getting better like fine wine with time, it's our time to shine
