Always thought that I will be someone on my
Two feet, all I need is this blunt and I'm
Flying high in the sky, when the evening come
But when I close my eyes, I see the demons run
They comin' for me and I ain't even running away
They looking for me and I ain't scared to show my face
No fearing death, cause I start to push it all away
Until the bricks and the wall all evaporate
They can't take my pride, they can't my strife
They try to hold me down, too much left inside
To let it die, we all kliqued up tonight
Thought I'd let the world know, what it means to fight
All lies against you, they said I was meant to do something else
Beside this rapping venture
But I now represent it
To get this wake a scripture
And I'm doing my best to paint a vivid picture
For those who doubt me, know nothing about me
They need to watch their mouth, they'll never come around me
I stay in my own lane, I'm doing my own thing
You keep on trying but you'd never understand my mindframe
I stay in the darkness, I'm ready to spark
This place up, tired of feeling like I'm stuck and I'm worthless
I'm breaking these curses, by killing these verses
We gon' make 'em all remember us, and that's for certain

Looking at these choices
Fear voices
Wrapped around my head it feels like torture
I don't know which way to turn
No matter what I do, I'm still gon' burn
So much stress, I just got to go
I'm living everyday, like I'm 'bout to blow
That's why I can't help to smoke
Catch a cloud in the humid
Need to stop and go

So much stress, I just got to go
I'm living everyday, like I'm 'bout to blow (here we go)
That's why I can't help to smoke
Catch a cloud in the humid
Need to stop and go
Now it smell just like some kill
Lost in the matrix, tryna' find what's real (who's that?)
I can see from here, the face of a siren
Singing "please come here"
Temptations calling me
Through my past, how I fell
Mellows over me (it's on me)
"Come together or we all gon' bleed"
Said the voice of the angel from the fallen tree
She acts like I have a voice
Like fate is not really dull
I love the sound of her voice
I jump when I hear her call
She'll be the death of me
Unless I can look away
She brings out the best in me
Her color still turns to gray
I'm trying to find
A crystal clear path
From a mindless blight
I get sucked in, to the world pulled of life
Guess I won't need to wake up
Trust me, that's why
