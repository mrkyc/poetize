I'm not sure why I say the things I do
When I'm intoxicated
I act a fool and I don't know why
I like to blame the alcohol I abuse
Instead of facing the truth
Look in the mirror recognize I'm
Not myself, not the person I was raised to be
And I can undestand
Why everyone wants to see a change in me
But I can only do what I can
With these thoughts in my head
Trying to find where the maze is
But the dealer let me call once again
All by myself it makes me question
Everyone around me
Are they just judging, I wonder
Or do they care about me
I know I crossed the line
Sincerely I apologize
I wanna be better for you and me
I know this right here is a sign
For us to make it now
There's no way
It's right there for the taking
Both of our lives
But they were saving
As my heart keeps breaking
I just wanna believe in you
And you to feel the same
No matter what happens
That love will always remain
When you say my name
You might also like
Here I go again
Messing everything up
Turning everything that's good in my life
Into dust
Here I go again
Getting way too drunk
Telling you those stupid things I say
When I drink too much
Here I go again

Real shit
The truth is the way the world is
Is why I'm ruthless
I feel useless
I'm so used to life leaving bruises
I'm foolish but I'm not stupid
I'm not a sheep following the shepherd
Who Is walking clueless
I'm far from perfect
And sometimes I don't know what I'm doing
I know I fuck up all the time
Man, I'm only human
And I'm not lying
I see plenty room for improvement
But I feel like when I'm improving
It's only an illusion
I don't wanna see a flatline
Before I see my daughter get married
What's the point of living life
If we're living to get buried
I know I lean on the bottle
Just a little too damn hard (too damn hard)
And everytime I get my hands on some liquor
Seems to wake up a demon
Now I'm thinking out loud
And you probably wanna kill me
But I only have good intentions
I swear to God (I swear to God)
Here I go again
Messing everything up
Turning everything that's good in my life
Into dust
Here I go again
Getting way too drunk
Telling you those stupid things I say
When I drink too much
Here I go again
Messing everything up
Turning everything that's good in my life
Into dust
Here I go again
Getting way too drunk
Telling you those stupid things I say
When I drink too much
