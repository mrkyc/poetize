Tie 'em to the bumper, drag 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love that hoe

Starts with the tinglin then it starts lingerin
The blood pressure blockin' braincells from breathin' in
Oxygen replaced by toxic intake makes my conscious escape from my thoughts I keep thinking
When i'm feeling paranoid you can see my hands shake
Gotta rapidly cannabinoid feeling that we shake
Litter the feelins now I just sit and call for wait
To get rid of the visions buried in the coffin awake
Blurring the lines between dreams and reality
Burnin' my eyes from the dark screamin so doubt me
Heavenly father, why are you mad at me?
No answer, i guess it was something i had to see
Whoever orchestrated this making a big mistake
But half of me kind of expected this with my fate
Cuz when i'm reborn they'll send me back to confiscate
The collection of souls to send them to their proper place

My torturous ways no soul can save the one from the wicked side of the playground
Why nobody wants to hang out, run and hide and shots, they ring out
Duckin', dodgin', actin' (?), try to run up on me in the darkness
Carved in piece of garbage, now he's lost and he's swimming with the dolphins, lonely
Psychopathic, schizophrenic, try sometimes and I just can't stand it
Mind is manic, (?) are plannin', no way for me to get away from this planet
Guess I'm just brain damaged, judged by those who could never understand it
Ban me, took this hell for a brief from this world, dead bodies all around me when they found me
You might also like
Brain damage, psychopathic, black magic is my passion
I'll have you talkin' in tongues of dead, walkin' backwards
Feels like the oxygen has cut off from my brain
Welcome to the mind of the clinically insane
Axe behind my back, smokin' on a blunt
I'm never seein' heaven and I don't give a fuck
Yes, you should lock me up and throw away the key, now
Cause I will look down upon them as they bleed in the street, now
Body parts often fall apart when it's after dark
Fire sparks up the body parts I left in the park
Leavin' carcass to burn and rippin' up at yo heart
Put the body parts in the drastic ritual's about to start

BLAY!
Scarecrow the destroyer, mystic kamikaze warrior
Chop your organs in the fortress with the vultures, feed you to the porpoise
Cannibalistic butcher shop, Soze, bloody cornfield crop
Samurai yell out "banzai" then I eat ya eyes like tater tots
(?) bloody tissue, Infamous split you under the mistletoe
Drain you like some pure cocaine with skills and then I numb my throat
Scarecrow is the bogeyman, Old Testament or Quran
Welcome to yo worst nightmare that never, ever, ever ends

Of course I bring the pain, my wicked ways are so unchained
My tainted sounds are coursing through my veins
I can't control it, psychopathic, schizophrenic
What they call me: King of Horrorcore
Scan Man the Satan worshipper, but they don't understand me
So I bring it how I bring it, fuck the people who don't like it
My music's for the ones who need it
Maybe we bond and evolve into a different species
The Nephilim, the fallen beings
Label me the one who taint the minds and deceive the people
Welcome to my sacrifice
You sell your soul to me, I guarantee a good price
I promise you can buy it back, Scan Man - I keep my word
But it's gon' cost ya extra souls of your unborn
(Time to meet yo maker)
This world is forsaken, an abomination
I see not forgiveness in this body, I have sinned
Wicked lust is the drug that we love, so give in
To this shit, you can't win, you can't win, you can't win
My nine is to ya busta face to make sure that you are erased
Downin' the fuckin' gin again, deepthroatin' the bottle with no chase
Devil shit all in my heart, Lucifer visits to get to my soul
Piggy is lookin' for Pimp once again cuz they said that I just violated parole
Nowadays make a nigga clown, I hate you hoes, can't stand you tricks
Police be always harassin' my ass, deep in my hair just like some ticks
Head in to South Memphis they don't have no case i'm feeling safe
Evidence was wiped away, there won't be a first fourty eight
Nine is cocked right to yo dome, psychotic shit yo so what you go do
I be increasin up the murder rate homie this shit is normal it isn't taboo
Grab the keys to the pickup ready chevy can't forget my trick
Better believe that i'm rollin heavy soakin yo sets so beware for the rest
Pine box, nigga lost they life, kidnap they wife
Sacrifice, deadly night, better bring more than a pocket knife
I trick n treat like halloween, but no candy in my bag
Like dynamite, explode on yo monkey ass

One: he done fucked up, two: that bitch 'bout to die
Three: I'm a bad guy, you suckers are nice guys
Teflons goin' in, bullets straight through yo chest
Hoe don't die yet, the Koopsta ain't finished it
When I start jackin' nigga, it's gonna be a ambulance call
Call up my roadies mane; Crunchy Black, Lord and Paul
Koop with the Devil Shyt, you bitches don't understand
Scopin' with that red dot, I'm always the triggerman
P is for pussy hoes and also these puss ass niggas
Every nigga that try to test, they found 'em off in the river
Dead with corroded flesh, the (?) crest
Don't need no alibi, the creepsta ain't finished it
I fucks with Kaotic Klique, blood looks like red dye
