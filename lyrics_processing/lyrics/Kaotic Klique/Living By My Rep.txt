Yeah I know how death feels
Riding in a Lexus
Pilled out like my mom is
Living by my rep bitch
Living by my rep bitch
Living by my rep bitch
Stay strong, stay strong is what they tell me
But I know, I know, that they won't help me
They tell me "stay the same, don't let the game break you"
I bet a couple million in your face would change you too

The devil offered me the deal of a lifetime
And I've been struggling so he caught me at the right time
Take this pain full inside yeah, turn this stress into fire
Life resent rises higher, love to watch it rise higher
Yeah, now I'm dead on the inside, inner sense is lost now
Didn't know what means mine
Touch the blunt to the fire
Cause I need to get higher
As I dance on the ashes
Of forgiveness will find me
You might also like
The game will change you up
Wake you up to all the things you thought was really ain't no more
I'd like to see you go from broke to have it, don't they wanna act the same
Just like it was before, now there's alcohol everywhere, defining screen
Laughin' at this life of luxury, when I was dead broke nobody fucked with me
Why would I go back to back, at strike three
Man I'm tired of losing, you tell me to stay strong
Don't change for no one, just play the same song
Over and over because it suits your art
I'll never forget exactly where the fuck you came from
I'll never forget what day it's time to move on
I did this for me, and my family tree
Now everybody walking proud, like they all independent
You can think what you want, this' my destiny

Yeah I know how death feels
Riding in a Lexus
Pilled out like my mom is
Living by my rep bitch
Living by me rep bitch
Living by me rep bitch
Stay strong, stay strong is what they tell me
But I know, I know, that they won't help me
They tell me "stay the same, don't let the game break you"
I bet a couple million in your face would change you too
Stay strong, stay strong is what they tell me
But I know, I know, that they won't help me
They tell me "stay the same, don't let the game break you"
I bet a couple million in your face would change you too
Yeah I know how death feels
