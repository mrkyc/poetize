Everybody keeps texting my phone saying
"Where the fuck you been?" (where the fuck you been)
Found a little piece of heaven in the middle of this hellfire
Where I live (hellfire where I live)
And I can make excuses for days
About everything I do (everything I do)
I don't really feel the need to explain myself
I don't got no shit to prove
Blinds fall down and there's nothing on the other side
I wanna see (nothing I wanna see)
Just a messed up world full of hate and sorrow
That loves to fuck with me (loves to fuck with me)
I'm a sucker for pain and needs
I'm sure you can understand (what's that?)
In this world full of lies
Where everybody bites
Shit's something like my vicodine

I look for a happy place
But i fell so many times (fell so many times)
I always jump the gun anytime
I see the light (anytime I see)
If it makes you smile I'll keep trying till I die
(trying till I die)
If you wanna find me
I'll be hiding in this hell getting wasted
Thinking about you
You might also like
Got me wasted in my room
I don't go outdoors these days
There's nothing left for me to see or say
I had it all at one time
And watch it fall right through my fingers
As your memory lingers on
These hours on the clock
Get longer as this painkillers keep getting stronger
Another bottle watch me pile that shit up
My friends calling but I'm done, mind left
A long time ago
Thinking it was the same day that you walked out the door
Never the same, the pain, only thing that will remain
On some day you're gone
I wonder will you remember me
Will I remember you
When taking a shot to every kiss we had
Fall over and cry and laugh
At the same time again
I'm just getting started with this drinking
Try to swim but now I'm sinking to the bottle
Flashing lights, they keep on blinking
In my eyes, as the medics try to bring me back to life
But I left it all behind
Time for me to see what's on the other side

I look for a happy place
But i fell so many times (fell so many times)
I always jump the gun anytime
I see the light (anytime I see)
If it makes you smile I'll keep trying till I die
(Till I die)
If you wanna find me
I'll be hiding in this hell getting wasted
