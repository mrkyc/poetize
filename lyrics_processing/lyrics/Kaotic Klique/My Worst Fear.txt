Sitting alone
I'm lost in this darkness, wish I had a clone
Or someone to talk to, that could understand all these thoughts
That race through my dome
And I never be home
So when you talking to me, mane, better watch that tone
Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
No friends or no family to help me know
What's right from wrong, when I hear this song
Make me wanna go and like the torture
In brain the fire, to all of these liars
I'm laughing while I'm burning all their portraits
And we scorched the earth, kaotics' birthday
Say we cursed but I feel so blessed
When I hit that SAS, put it all in my chest
Blow it out to them would they say "whats up"
Noone to talk to, so I talk through
This music, and I choose it
It's the only thing that helps me not feel useless
Still crusing and searching
My fear is asserting
I'm closing these curtains
No more will they hurt me

My worst fear is dying alone
All by myself (never known by noone, can't hold that no more)
My worst fear is dying alone
Next to no one else (never known by no one, can't hold that no more)
X2

I need me some reassurance (that I will never get)
I leave bottles open, pouring (just trying to forget)
I feel like I'm just a no one (when I am at my bed)
It feels like this life is hopeless (so hopeless)
I know I need to quit losing, focus (I'm one that's counterfeit)
I bleed when it cuts me open (and no, I don't regret)
I bleed, but I'm almost broken (my mental ultimate)
It feels like this life is hopeless (so hopeless)
This coward's attitude will leave me living by myself
All alone it's hard to cope, when there's noone else
Left with nobody to hold my face, it's like "oh well"
And all that I can do is try
Not to die by myself

My worst fear is dying alone
All by myself (never known by noone, can't hold that no more)
My worst fear is dying alone
