You say that we have grown apart
You say it's how it has to be
I watch as you walk out of my life
Taking with you my sanit (sanity)

You saved me last forever
All i can is use to feeling mispure
I'm starting to feel sick when now without you
It's like you are the cure
The only thing that's right
In this world full of wrong
The only reason why
I decided to write this song
You came to me, in a dream
Beautiful lies, wicked queen
Look at this smile, killing me
Tried to defy my family
Manipulation is your occupation
So many times I
Just wanted to change the station
But the same trash keeps on playing
You breaking my heart
Seems to be my only destination
No, it's bound to happen
And for some reason I can't face it
Got me locked up
Threw away the key, my time's up
Ain't no saving me 
I drop up, I lost my ways
I bowed down, dropped to my knees
And prayed for something better
Prayed to finally see the light
So think about today I'll dream about you
When I sleep at night
You say it's time to go
Look, I'm just not ready to leave
To be what I have to do
To make you see
You belong with me
You might also like
You say that we have grown apart
You say it's how it has to be
I watch as you walk out of my life
Taking with you my sanity

So now you tell me you're leaving
Trying so hard to understand
All alone, all alone
It's just so hard to believe in
I tried as hard as I can
All alone, all alone
Queen of the damned
Pulled me by my feet out this sand
Melted the eyes around my heart
With the heat of her hands
Started breathing again
She loved me for the creature I am
She took my doubt about myself
Made me believe that I can
Believe I'm the man
Turned me into believable again
Took this alcoholic
And pulled me out the reach of a can
That piece once again
She pulled out the streets like a friend
Feel like I'll never use my nine milimeter again
But now she's leaving
Me inside this empty house, bleeding
Crushing in everything I believe in
The heathen, that's fiending for a reason
To act an ass
Like a crack addict
That just spent that last stack of cash
I told you what you walk about
I thought you see me all the new
Bout to jump off a bridge
Just feels because I sink in the blue
So when you walk away from this grenade
You pull out the pin
Just to ensure that I will never fall in love
Again
You say that we have grown apart
You say it's how it has to be
I watch as you walk out of my life
Taking with you my sanity
So now you tell me you're leaving
Trying so hard to understand
All alone, all alone
It's just so hard to believe in
I tried as hard as I can
All alone, all alone
You say that we have grown apart
Trying so hard to understand
You say it's how it has to be (has to be)
I watch as you walk out of my life
(I tried as hard as I can)
