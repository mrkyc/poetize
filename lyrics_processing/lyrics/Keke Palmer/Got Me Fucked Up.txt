I don't know what he thinking 'cause he came from the bando
He done got me fucked up (Got me fucked up)
'Cause he see me in the movies in L.A. on the boulevard
He got me fucked up (Got me fucked up)
I don't know what he thinking 'cause he say he from the hood
He done got me fucked up (Got me fucked up)
Last night this lame ass nigga tried to play me (It's Dreez)
Done got me fucked up (Got me fucked up)

No nigga, no problems
I wonder now you gotta see the money pile up
Gotta see me on the islands
Get a little away, and niggas tellin' you a wilin'
(What the fuck she got on?)
Look, I'm single, so what you talking about?
You be goin' after bitches that be stalking the clout
Look, that shit dead, I'm chalking 'em out
They come in like they running shit, I end up walking 'em out
Bye

Nigga running game
Shawty I'ma twenty-two year old boss
Caught up in my fame
Want me to be the girlfriend, not me
We could do the whole thing, nigga, I free
But I ain't got time for your fake nicknames
Don't call me love (say that shit)
But every time that I'm in town you wanna bitch down with me
Come through, smoke some, so you can dick down in me
Run up in the store when you know you ain't gon' buy shit
I'm in that G-Wagon Benz, laid back
Been made my own money since the A track
Nigga say he a owner, but he pull up like a customer
Me and my bitches at each other like, "What the fuck?"

Had to put the bitch nigga in the cooler
Sixth grade teacher with the ruler
Young niggas, who you gassing?
Didn't know Lil Keelah and the Bee could get nasty
Whisper in my ear then I getcha off
Run your mouth too much, nigga walkie talkie
A Chanel bag, nigga you could pick your coffin
I don't give a lame nigga second chance
Check please
Next bitch in your life
Show her what you learned
Tell her you were gunning for a bitch, but I just hit you first
This young nigga old school
He tried to hit me with the old rules
I had to dump him in the big pool
He was see through
Nigga me too
I could eat food while I play you
You fucking with them pro tools
Fuck nigga, talking 'bout get back to me, get back to me
Talking get back to me
Now a nigga wanna come back, now that you see (Now that you see)
Fuck nigga, talking 'bout get back to me, get back to me
Talking get back to me
