Damn, shawty hit me with the Uzi

Hit me in the stomach
Told me that he loved me like a Scarface movie
I'm down
Hating myself every minute cause I can't resist you
Knowing it'll never be the same cause what we been through
Pick up the phone

Every time I think about us getting back (getting back)
All that I can think is you was hitting that (hitting that)
I don't wanna be here all alone (all alone)
Pick up the phone
