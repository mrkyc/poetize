If I had a dollar for everytime I think of you
I would be rich
Wish I had control of the way that I feel for you
It's never and never enough

Sometimes I wish I wasn't stuck on you
Cause you got me all twisted
And times I feel like such a fool
It's like I can't do nothing without you

Why you do me this way?
I'm going insane
Day and night, you're on my brain
You do me this way
Don't want it to change, but sometimes, it's just too much
Get out my head
You know you got me thinking 'bout you all the time
Get out my head
I don't know what to do, can't get you off my mind

Get out my head, get out my head, get out my head
I'm begging you now
Get out my head, get out my head, get out my head
Get out my head
You might also like
You know, I usually try to play it cool
But with you it ain't the same
Boy, you know you're stuck in my brain, like glue
No matter what I do, I can't get you off my mind

Sometimes I wish I wasn't stuck on you
Cause you got me all twisted
And times I feel like such a fool
It's like I can't do nothing without you

Why you do me this way?
I'm going insane
Day and night, you're on my brain
You do me this way
Don't want it to change, but sometimes, it's just too much
Get out my head
You know you got me thinking 'bout you all the time
Get out my head
I don't know what to do, can't get you off my mind

Get out my head, get out my head, get out my head
I'm begging you now
Get out my head, get out my head, get out my head
Get out my head
I see your face every time I close my eyes
I lie awake, can't concentrate on anything
Cause everything reminds me of you
Nothing I can do now, cause you're a part of me
It's a battle I can't win, cause you've got all of me
You're like the phone always ringing in my head
That's calling me to you

Why you do me this way?
I'm going insane
Day and night, you're on my brain
You do me this way
Don't want it to change, but sometimes, it's just too much
Get out my head
You know you got me thinking 'bout you all the time
Get out my head
I don't know what to do, can't get you off my mind

Get out my head, get out my head, get out my head
I'm begging you now
Get out my head, get out my head, get out my head
