Tonight is the right night everybody's alright
Yo feel it in my bones
We gon' make it out of sight
So if your ready go party to the daylight
Comin' alive with me
Baby don't be shy
It's time to come alive yeah have a good time so get your hands high
Groove cuz it feels right
Under the moonlight
Nod your head with me
(Nod your head with me)

When the night time comes we go wild
Madness under the moon is our style
Do what we want, the magic is right
This party under the morning in light

On and on and on and on and
On and on and on and until the mornin'
Until the sun comes up, we keep ballin'
Me and my darlin', dream til' we fallin'
On and on and on and on and
On and on and on and until the mornin'
For a young the night is still young
Yeah we gon' party 'til the party done

Come with me, let's get away
Out all night, and sleep all day
I don't care what people say
Keep goin' and goin' and goin' our way
After dark, we get it poppin'
Once it comes, the life, there's no stoppin'
Hit the feeling, catch the flow
Of the nighttime groove, so here we go

Y'all is sippin' on a pina colada
Build in dunno in a full suit of water
She all can know what she got from her mother
Club is on fire, but no need for water
Ooh, everybody's ravin', girls on the dance floor misbehavin' Nobody discover the switch, everybody close up
So you know what everyone is cravin'
Hey!
