I don't think that I'm ready now
What he bringing now
Damn he bring it now

He applyin' that pressure
He bringing that pressure
He say he see what he want and
He won't stop until he get it
He applyin' that pressure
He bringing that pressure
So deep, I can't say I'm ready now

He want me to believe him
But I can just see that
The moment that I let him get up in my heart and into my mind
Then I'm completely gone
Yeah, thug is my weakness
He bring out my freakness
I see all these niggas but I never like them regulars
I just never had an interest in them amateurs
Sometimes when you're deep in
You're getting all underneath it
That's when you find it's not your heart
It's your mind that's the weakness
And maybe that is the part I'm not ready for
I'm sure you're lit tonight
Show me a real good time
That don't mean your love and protection, affection
It's gon' be right

So deep, but I can't say I'm ready now

If you know the pain my heart and I have seen before
Then you understand

Sometimes I need a girlfriend to be the only someone that I'm fucking
Sometimes I need a real nigga from a real city with some real dick
I know I'm complicated so if you could steal my heart you lucky
I need the type of someone who can handle these facts
And I ain't gotta worry looking over my back
See I done have my own share of hurt, and dammit I cried with it
See I got a little bit of baggage but nigga I'm fine with it
So before we hit the lights, you gotta recognize these signs
Putting in the gas 'fore this motherfucker take flight
And your turbulence becomes too much

So deep, but I can't say I'm ready now
I mean, I really like you
But there's just some things that I
I'm really not sure about at this point
I really been through a lot
So deep, I don't think I'm ready now
Sometimes you just wanna get
You wanna get to the place where
Where you not dealing with people that's gonna hurt you all the time
You wanna know yourself enough to
To really know what it is
So deep, I don't think I'm ready now
What you looking at when you see what you want
I don't know
I don't know
So deep, I don't think I'm ready now

He won't stop until he get it
