Oh
Oh (Hey)
Oh

You're like a puzzle, pieces are on the ground
Nothing but trouble, no one to bail me out
If we were flying, you know we be headed south
It's like rocket science cause I'm fighting, tryna work it out

Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I'm going insane
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Oh, this is love/hate
Spinning my world around
I can't even think straight
With or without you now
Baby, for love's sake
Why can't you help me out?
Oh I just can't figure
I just can't figure you out
You might also like
I just can't figure you out
I just can't figure
I just can't figure you out

You see me bleeding and you cut me for the thrill
I say, "I'm leaving", but my feet are standing still
You're like an angel doing the devil's will
Sometimes I wonder how I wandered underneath your spell

Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh
You're wrecking my brain
Woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Oh, this is love/hate
Spinning my world around
I can't even think straight
With or without you now
Baby, for love's sake
Why can't you help me out?
Oh I just can't figure
I just can't figure you out
I just can't figure you out
I just can't figure
I just can't figure you out
