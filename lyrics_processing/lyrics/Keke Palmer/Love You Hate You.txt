I hate you so bad
Said "I don't miss you"
You know that's not true
Boy I want you bad
I hate you so much
But I love you oh so bad
When I say I'm leaving
I don't mean it
I just want you back
Got my hopes up
When we broke up
That we would get back always said that no matter what we would be together
I want you back more than ever
Fells like we on a roller-coaster
You take me up high then take me down low
There go them games boy you think your clever
You try to play me its so whatever
Somedays we on the same page oooo then we go our separate ways and our loves down the drain
Then I'm calling you again
Somedays we on the same page then we go our separate ways and our loves down the drain then I'm calling you again
I love you so much
I hate you so bad said "I don't miss you"
You know that's true boy I want you bad
I hate you so much
But I love you oh so bad
When I say I'm leaving
I don't mean it I just want you back

Tell me or when we can make this better
Boy I want you back now forever
Can we base it all on this week together
Boy I want you back now forever
When you call me and I hang up
And I call right back and you pick up
Phone dies cause we talk forever
Can't resist you got super powers
Only want me when your lonely
But when I want you, you don't know me
You text me and say "I'll hit you later"
Really I wish you would come and save me
Somedays we on the same page
Then we go our separate ways
And our loves down the drain
Then I'm calling you again
Somedays we on the same page
Then we go our separate ways
And our loves down the drain
Then I'm calling you again
I love you so much
I hate you so bad said "I don't miss you"
You know that's not true
Boy I want you bad
I hate you so much
But I love you oh so bad
When I say I'm leaving
I don't mean it
