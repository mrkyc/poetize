Tonight I wanna cross the line, baby, don't waste my time
Temperature is high, need you to relieve my mind
Speak to me, no words, touch me if you wanna say anything
Just take this pain away

Feel it all in my body (My body), tired of feeling sorry (Sorry)
For something I cannot change, yeah (Yeah)
Need somethin' in return for all these lessons learned
Hoping's just gon' bring more pain

Do you mind if I make it up to myself? Just this time
Get in line or you're gonna find yourself left, right or wrong?
I'ma ride by my side 'til my last breath
Do you mind if I make it up to myself? ('Cause I need me, too)

I got standards, can't let go my standards
This time around, you better hold me down
I got standards, and I won't lay down my standards
Just to be involved, I can't let my crown fall

Think about it all the time, does it ever cross your mind?
Good love ain't really hard to find, you just gotta look inside, yeah
Can't get sidetracked with broken promises
This time when I put me first, I will not regret it
