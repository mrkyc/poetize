Fuck it up!

Brown-eyed freak
Wit' toasty round cheeks
Think that in your sleep
And you'll have a good dream
Your dream lover (Your dream lover)
Feel me so deep in your R.E.M. sleep
Dreamcatcher (Dreamcatcher)
I won't run, oh

Make love when you're dreaming
Really turns me on that you think of me
Live for fantasy
Catch me in your drea-drea-drea-dreams

Ooh, make love to your dream girl
Really turns me on that you think of me
I'm all in your dreams (Dreams)
Hope it helps you sleep (Sleep)
When you're touching me, me, me, yeah

Let's catch dreams, not chase 'em
It's a full moon tonight
All up in your sleep tonight
I could leave the TV on all night
Gotta believe that it's true
Jackson, get nasty
Lover, I won't run

Make love when you're dreaming
Really turns me on that you think of me
Live for fantasy
Catch me in your drea-drea-drea-dreams
