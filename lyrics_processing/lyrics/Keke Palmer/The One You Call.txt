So you think you can just call me like this?
Naw, not me

Oh really?
So, you sitting at home?
Got bored and you called me up
You're so silly
Did you think that I'd be hanging 'round, just waitin on ya?
But who are you kidding?
Your girlfriend probably just dumped you
So you went through your phone just to see who'd pick up
But it won't be me, no

Not gonna be the one you call
Cause you missed out on a good one, now you're feeling lonely Not gonna be the one you call
I forgot all bout you, why you all on me?
Not gonna be the one you call
You should really go back to her, cause right now you're working my nerves
Cause I'm not gonna be, not, not gonna be the one you call

So you don't listen?
Did you not get the hint, when I said I'm not interested?
With me your times ran out
Don't you think you should give up now?
But who are you kidding?
I know for a fact your girl dumped you
Heard you took it real hard, kinda feel sorry for you
But it won't be me, sorry it won't be me

Not gonna be the one you call
Cause you missed out on a good one, now you're feeling lonely Not gonna be the one you call
I forgot all bout you, why you all on me?
Not gonna be the one you call
You should really go back to her, cause right now you're working my nerves
Cause I'm not gonna be, not, not gonna be the one you call

Now I know it's hard to get over a break up
But what gives you the right to think that I'm gon' wait up?
Don't you see that you're playing yourself?
Trying to break a promise to somebody else
So when you're feeling lonely next time, don't call me

Not gonna be the one you call
Cause you missed out on a good one
Not gonna be the one you call
I forgot all bout you, why you all on me?
Not gonna be the one you call
You should really go back to her, cause right now you're working my nerves
Cause I'm not gonna be, not, not gonna be the one you call
