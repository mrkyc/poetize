Catour, fuck it up

Body cold (Frosty)
And I'm so (Bossy)
Ain't I so (Saucy?)
And my clothes (Cost me)
Life of the party (Party)
Always get it started (Get it started)
Ain't I so (Bossy?)
Ain't I so? (So)

I'm independent got my own boo (Got my own boo)
And I can fuck some cash up if I want to (If I want to)
Fuck it up, body cold (Frosty)
And I'm so (Bossy)
Ain't I so (Saucy?)
And my clothes (Cost me)

December cold, walk by feel the draft
Lil booty's matter, don't need a lot of ass
I'm my own boss and I got my own cash
I don't need no nigga, only thing I needs a bag
You might also like
Hood and I'm bougie
Gucci on my booty
Poppin like a toolie
You ain't poppin' need to cool it
Just cash up with my jeweler
Why you stuck here looking stupid
Winnin while they losin'
Get your nigga 'cause he choosin

Diamonds on me and they dancing just like Chris
Pockets heavy got me walking with a limp
I'm a fly chick, hop up on and take a trip
These Jimmy Choos that's on my feet they cost a grip

Body cold (Frosty)
And I'm so (Bossy)
Ain't I so (Saucy?)
And my clothes (Cost me)
Life of the party (Party)
Always get it started (Get it started)
Ain't I so (Bossy?)
Ain't I so? (So)
I'm independent got my own boo (Got my own boo)
And I can fuck some cash up if I want to (If I want to)
Fuck it up, body cold (Frosty)
And I'm so (Bossy)
Ain't I so (Saucy?)
And my clothes (Cost me)

December cold, walk by feel the draft
Lil booties matter, don't need a lot of ass
I'm my own boss and I got my own cash
I don't need no nigga, only thing I needs a bag

Hood and I'm bougie
Gucci on my booty
Poppin like a toolie
You ain't poppin' need to cool it
Just cash up with my jeweler
Why you stuck here looking stupid
Winnin while they losin'
Get your nigga cause he choosin

I'm a game changer, I'm a play maker
You a lame major, world class hater
I got mad paper, you in bad shape
Account with negatives, overdraft paper
If you ain't got no car then you can't come
Ain't talking about no check that's where you lost
Can't fuck with busted bitches, I ain't sorry
If I ain't in that bitch it ain't a party
Body cold (Frosty)
And I'm so (Bossy)
Ain't I so (Saucy?)
And my clothes (Cost me)
Life of the party (Party)
Always get it started (Get it started)
Ain't I so (Bossy?)
Ain't I so? (So)

I'm independent got my own boo (Got my own boo)
And I can fuck some cash up if I want to (If I want to)
Fuck it up, body cold (Frosty)
