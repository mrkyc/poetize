Two up
Fuck who up?
I was sitting in the coup, watch the bitch pull up
Hater nigga think he slick, bitch rick ruler
Tell her, if she tag me again she gon' see thriller

You say that you promise to love me, love me
That's what you said
But I see your shawty all on my IG
She just play, play
If I didn't have so much going for me (For me)
I'd fuck you up for this jealousy
Bitch, don't let this TV make you think that you know me

Chi-Town, south side, Mudville; Bitch, what's good?
(Know what I do)
I don't have to twist no fingers, just know I'm good
(At what I do)
You betta get beside her 'fore you catch me in a lineup
Tied up, any case I ain't got no business involved
(All because you in your feelings that we ain't what we were)
So tired of niggas appetite
Always wanna share the spotlight
My type is them boys that got a little street life
I could still find little bitches same time, give her that love
But nigga granted, I let you get up in the panties
You panicked, guess I'm moving on, you can't stand it
Fuck a virgo over one time, I leave you stranded
I'm passed it, ain't no hard feelings at all

Bitch, don't let this TV make you think that you know me

I know you ain't into her
(I know you ain't into her)
But she is the best option you could grab
Your insecurities have been revealed but you're not saying a thing (A thing)
No need to speak
She know you hitting my phone?
So sick, nigga please, what is it you want?
If you're taking her away (On vacation)
Then there ain't no need in texting me
I know she a thing for the thirsty
She gon' be the first one to let that slip
Tell that bitch don't come around here unless she ready for the shit
She ain't been on before
