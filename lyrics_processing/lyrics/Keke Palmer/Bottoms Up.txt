Move your hips, do your thang
Get off the wall, don't matter what they think
From your fingertips to your toes
You know you're hot, so let everybody know
Gotta take it low, to the floor
From The Hills, to the streets of the ghetto
Hips don't lie, so move 'em up
We ain't gon' stop, till we see everybody's bottoms up

Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up (Bottoms up, y'all)
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up

Miss KeKe P, lookin' extra glossy
Got pep your style, lookin' extra flossy
I'm bossy, but I keeps it cute
With my stunner shades on, and a tree in my roots
I got the Chi-town swagger, and I rocks it full
Yes, Mudville, baby, we don't take no bull
We keep it rockin' when we move our hips
Do that old skool stunt when we make it dip
You might also like
Move your hips, do your thang
Get off the wall, don't matter what they think
From your fingertips to your toes
You know you're hot, so let everybody know
Gotta take it low, to the floor
From The Hills, to the streets of the ghetto
Hips don't lie, so move 'em up
We ain't gon' stop, till we see everybody's bottoms up

Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up (Get, get your bottoms up)
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up

Keep it movin', man
Keep it poppin', man
I be on the move, gotta catch me when you can
Might see my face on the movie screen
Hypnotize you, frame-to-frame, and scene-by-scene
Staying fly while I keep it fresh
Only thirteen, and I ain't even close yet
Sittin' back, saying this a hit
While you swing side to side, and move your hips
You got some swagger? Better let 'em know
You got some swagger? Better let it show
Take your swagger with you to the air, and roll it back out to the bay
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away

Move your hips, do your thang
Get off the wall, don't matter what they think
From your fingertips to your toes
You know you're hot, so let everybody know
Gotta take it low, to the floor
From The Hills, to the streets of the ghetto
Hips don't lie, so move 'em up
We ain't gon' stop, till we see everybody's bottoms up

Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up (Here we go, here we go)
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up
You got some swagger? Better let 'em know
You got some swagger? Better let it show
Take your swagger with you to the air, and roll it back out to the bay
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
Now bob your head, then look away
