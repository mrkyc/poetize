Sitting up at night
And I'm wondering why my fairytale can't become a reality
Everything I've seen seems so out of reach
Maybe it's just that impossible

Where's my knight and shining armor to save me?
Feels like I've been waiting so long
Can you hear me calling out for you, baby?
Take my hand and make me the one

Since forever, I have known that the rockets stand alone
I am waiting on that one that I can call my own
When I wake in my sleep, I can only think one thing
Where's my Jay-Z looking for Beyonce?
Prince Charming, looking for a Cindi?
Will I ever, ever, ever find that Keke love, love?
Will I ever, ever, ever find that Keke love, love?
Will I ever, ever, ever find that Keke love, love?
Will I ever, ever, ever find that Keke love, love?

All I really want is a guy that can hold me down for real
One who understands how I feel
And that knows how to make me smile when I feel down
One who wipes my tears away, when they come falling down
Knows just what to say, when no one else is around

The bigger they are, the harder they fall
I must be too small, cause I ain't falling at all
They say love conquers everything
Why won't you come here and conquer me?
(If love was blind) I'd walk around with my eyes closed
(If love was time) I'd wait around till the clock strokes
Heard someone say love hurts, well not having love hurts worse
Cause I want it, I need it, gotta have it
It's hard to breathe without it
I need it, I want it, gotta have it

Since forever, I have known that the rockets stand alone
I am waiting on that one that I can call my own
When I wake in my sleep, I can only think one thing
