Boy, you got my heart be-be-beating out my chest
Hotter than the bass, when I drop it like th-th-th-that
Something like a walking cardiac arrest
Red alert, I'm falling for you, call the paramedi-di-di-di-dics

Now I, know just what I'm doing when I whine
My body like to keep a brother on his grind
Now I, now I know, baby, you don't mind
By the end of the song you'll be mi-i-i-i-ine

Boy, don't let me dance alone
Ba-ba-baby, don't let the music die-ie-ie
Boy, don't let me dance alone
Ba-ba-baby, put your hands in the sky-y-y
You'll be the flyest dude in this party
Meet me on the floor, wrap your arms around my body
So you don't have to dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone, dance alone, dance alone, yeah
Dance alone, dance alone, no, dance alone, you dont have to dance alone

Cleaner than an old school cherry Cadillac
My red dress hotter than the engine on fi-i-i-i-re
I'm bouncing up and down, like hydraulics
Energizer bunny got you going, going hi-i-i-i-higher
You might also like
Now I, know just what I'm doing when I whine
My body like to keep a brother on his grind
Now I, now I know, baby, you don't mind
By the end of the song you'll be mi-i-i-i-ine

Boy, don't let me dance alone
Ba-ba-baby, don't let the music die-ie-ie
Boy, don't let me dance alone
Ba-ba-baby, put your hands in the sky-y-y
You'll be the flyest dude in this party
Meet me on the floor, wrap your arms around my body
So you don't have to dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone, dance alone, dance alone, yeah
Dance alone, dance alone, no, dance alone, you dont have to dance alone

Tell me you don't gotta go
You could be my boyfriend
Baby, tell me what you say, say, say, say?
Let's just keep on dancing
Dancing like my boyfriend
Baby, tell me what you say, say, say?

Boy, don't let me dance alone
Ba-ba-baby, don't let the music die-ie-ie
Boy, don't let me dance alone
Ba-ba-baby, put your hands in the sky-y-y
You'll be the flyest dude in this party
Meet me on the floor, wrap your arms around my body
So you don't have to dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone, dance alone, dance alone, yeah
Boy, don't let me dance alone
Ba-ba-baby, don't let the music die-ie-ie
Boy, don't let me dance alone
Ba-ba-baby, put your hands in the sky-y-y
You'll be the flyest dude in this party
Meet me on the floor, wrap your arms around my body
So you don't have to dance alone
