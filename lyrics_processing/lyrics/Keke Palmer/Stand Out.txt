Stand out, oh
Stay true to what you believe in
Stand out, oh
Follow your dreams, you can do anything
All you gotta stand out
Stand out
Oh, ya gotta stand out

It's the heart of me
I can hardly breathe
If I have everything
It's all not what it seems
Only been my dream
Still with no freedom
I'm convinced beyond the glitter there's more than gold

There must be more
On wings I soar
Head to the clouds
Feet on the ground
Oh, we've been down
And pushed around
And now it's time for us to stand out
You might also like
Stand out, oh
Stay true to what you believe in
Stand out, oh
Follow your dreams, you can do anything
Oh, ya gotta stand out
Stand out
Oh, ya gotta stand out

Is this who I am?
Is this really me?
I look in the mirror
Don't like what I see
Now it's all so clear
Clearer than before
I'm convinced beyond the glitter there's more than gold

There must be more
On wings I soar
Head to the clouds
Feet on the ground
Oh, we've been down
And pushed around
And now it's time for us to stand out
Stand out, oh
Stay true to what you believe in
Stand out, oh
Follow your dreams, you can do anything
Oh, ya gotta stand out (gotta stand out, oh)
Stand out
Oh, ya gotta stand out (you gotta stand out)
Oh, ya gotta stand out (you gotta stand out)

Gotta stand out (out)
Gotta (gotta) stand out (out)
Gotta stand, gotta stand, gotta stand out
Gotta stand out
Gotta (gotta) stand out
Gotta stand out
Oh, ya gotta stand out
You gotta stand out
You gotta stand out
You gotta
You gotta stand out
Oh, yeah
