Change it up (custom made)
Take it off the rack (custom made)
Then re-arrange (custom made)
I gotta flip the style 'til it feels right
Change it up (custom made)
Make it fit for me (custom made)
My personality (custom made)
That's why I got the job as a VP

I'm different in my own way, got my new found fame
Gonna change the old game, put it in a new frame
True Jackson is the name
Flippin' it up when everybody does the same
Dulce and Versace got nothing on me
Mad Fashion's where everyone's gonna be
I do what I love, and I love what I do
Hope it shines through when I'm talking to you

From my head to my toes
It's all real, and you know
Fresh and cool, that's just what I do
T-R-U-E - J-A-C-K-S-O-N, VP

(Change it up) Working at a grown up job
Never really knew I could work this hard
Used to sit at home and watch TV
Now I'm in an office as the new VP
I'm always setting trends with my two best friends
When things get out of hand, we have a plan
We just messin' around
And we making new grounds for the whole wide world to see
If you see us in town, you know it's going down
Cause I'm the new VP

(Custom made) Huh-huh
(Custom made) Yeah
(Custom made)

When I hit the floor, even on the low
People check my style, it's new and original
It's always been like this since I was a kid
Pockets fit my vest
Shoes match my necklace

From my head to my toes
It's all real, and you know
Fresh and cool, that's just what I do
T-R-U-E - J-A-C-K-S-O-N, VP
