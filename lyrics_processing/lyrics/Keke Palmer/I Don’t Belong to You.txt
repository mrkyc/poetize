Ain't no white house, ain't no picket fence
Baby, you know we don't want the same things
While you're caught up in your feelings
I feel the same as I did yesterday
Baby, we've been through this and I feel the same way, ay
I know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe

Now you wanna act like I tricked you, ooh
But I'm sleep, can't you see?
