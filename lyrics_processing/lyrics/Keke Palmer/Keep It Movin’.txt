Alright y'all, it's Keke P
Huh, '07, we doin' it real big

Woke up in the morning and I see the sunshine
Only got the summertime on my mind
My girls and I, we kick it all the time
Only got the summertime on my mind
We keep it moving (Way-oh, ayo)
We keep it moving (Way-oh)
We keep it moving (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Everybody know that school's out, no doubt
You know this one goes out to all of my homies
It's what we've been waiting for
It's 92 (outside) let's make our move
And get into a little something
Radio's blasting, let's make this happen
Homies and shorties, stand up
Stand up, let's get this party on
Let's do this now, be young and proud
Let's go and show them how
Get it, get it

Everybody feelin' just fine, it's summertime

Woke up in the morning and I see the sunshine
Only got the summertime on my mind
My girls and I, we kick it all the time
Only got the summertime on my mind
We keep it moving (Way-oh, ayo)
We keep it moving (Way-oh)
We keep it moving (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

And 106 Park Gon' come on

It's a block party, so don't be afraid to lose control
It's all about you, so what it do
Can't nobody tell us nothing
Well, I love hip hop music
Let's go ahead and do this
Homies and shorties, stand up
Stand up, let's get this party on
We doing it now, be young and proud
Let's go and show them how
Get it, get it

Okay, it's summertime, 'bout to party like a rockstar
A couple months, speeding by, like a hot car
Cause time flies when you're having fun
So hit the floor, and try to find yourself a summer love
But me, I keep it moving all seven days of the week
I'm like Miami, cause the boy always bring the heat
I got them big thangs popping, like my name was T.I.P
Doing tricks in the whip with Keke P, a million dollar kid
Woke up in the morning and I see the sunshine
Only got the summertime on my mind
My girls and I, we kick it all the time
Only got the summertime on my mind
We keep it moving (Way-oh, ayo)
We keep it moving (Way-oh)
