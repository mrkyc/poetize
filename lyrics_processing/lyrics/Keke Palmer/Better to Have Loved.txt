Catour, fuck it up

You and me, I think we're something special
Been conntected soul and mind
This ain't even sexual (wait)
What we really need is understanding
Got to keep an open mind and I do that reciprocal

'Cause you is rare, you a diamond
Maybe I'm being bias
I look at you with the highest
Reverence, upper echelon
Help me understand, please
'Cause I need some clarity
Win or lose, don't interlude
I'll put it straight like this 'cause I

Want this
Even if it's for a moment
Even if it leads to nothing
That's gotta mean something
You know it's
Better to have loved than not at all (at all)
At all, at all, at all
You might also likeYou know I want this
Even if it's for a moment
Even if it leads to nothing
That's gotta mean something
You know it's
Better to have loved than not at all (at all)
At all, at all, at all

Now, if I'm giving the wrong impression
That's something we can talk about
Don't go and get in your feelings, no
Let's not get stuck on if we're crashing
Got to keep an open mind, what we got ain't typical

'Cause you is rare, you a diamond
Maybe I'm being bias
I look at you with the highest
Reverence, upper echelon
Help me understand, please
'Cause I need some clarity
Win or lose, don't interlude
I'll put it straight like this 'cause I

Want this
Even if it's for a moment
Even if it leads to nothing
That's gotta mean something
You know it's
Better to have loved than not at all (at all)
At all, at all, at all
You know I want this
Even if it's for a moment
Even if it leads to nothing
That's gotta mean something
You know it's
Better to have loved than not at all (at all)
At all, at all, at all

Yeah, you have no idea what I've been through
But it's okay, I'm in front of you now
I don't wanna wear you down
But keep that ass around here, soul speaking to me loud and clear
There's no doubt that I

Want this
Even if it's for a moment
Even if it leads to nothing
That's gotta mean something
You know it's
Better to have loved than not at all (at all)
At all, at all, at all
You know I want this
Even if it's for a moment
Even if it leads to nothing
That's gotta mean something
You know it's
Better to have loved than not at all (at all)
