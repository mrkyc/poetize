Tell myself I don't need it, but I can't deny
Tried to buy my freedom, but the price too high
Don't know how you got me speedin'
Now I'm caught up in a feelin'
You blind my conscious
I just know how bad I want this, I want you
(Runnin' all these yellow lights to get to you)

You left your name on it
Now it's too late for me
Pleasure all my pain away
It's my favorite remedy
These lights guide the way for me
No crowds, just these empty streets
Mission: let you get it
Heaven once you get it
If you let it, oh

I want you, take it, take it
Make it new, crave it, crave it
Can get used to it, to it
You're the proof, prove it, yeah
You might also like
That's why I like you
I don't have to show you what to do
Starving from this other wants some you
Gettin' closer every minute
I can't wait to get up in it
Runnin' all these yellow lights to get to you
All these yellow lights to get to you
Make me yours tonight, I won't refuse
Gettin' closer every minute
I can't wait 'til you're up in it
Runnin' all these yellow lights to get to (you)

You sink your fangs into me
Next taste, just a mile away
Your space so magnetizing
Is you ready? Oh

I want you, take it, take it
Make it new, crave it, crave it
Can get used to it, to it
You're the proof, prove it, hey

That's why I like you
I don't have to show you what to do
(I don't have to show you)
Starving from this other wants some you
Gettin' closer every minute
I can't wait to get up in it
Runnin' all these yellow lights to get to you (You)
All these yellow lights to get to you (Lights to get to you)
Make me yours tonight, I won't refuse (Won't refuse)
Gettin' closer every minute (Every minute)
I can't wait til you're up in it (You're up in it)
