(Fuck it up)
Boy, you should know that
I ain't got no plans to take you home yet
Dancin' close on your body
Don't mean I want another body
Would I ever lay with you? Nigga, probably
Just won't be tonight 'cause that's just not me
Guess I shouldn't have put you in a position to try me
I'm a little tease, that satisfies me

T-twerk and take a shot at the same time
I'm attracted to the bassline
Let you hold onto my waistline
Bet you wonder what I taste like
He said, "I'm straight up 'bout to know ya" (Yeah)
He asked if I could get to know ya (Yeah)
(But, look) I ain't finna bone ya (I already know)
One dance is all that I have for you
Twerk like I'm from New Orleans (Yeah)
Baby, can you handle all this? (Yeah)
But it don't matter 'cause you won't hit this
This dance is all that I have for you

Twerk on your body, twerk on your body, work
Bottles in my section, gettin' litty, gettin' turnt
Dance two songs with you 'cause I'm friendly and a flirt
Twerkin' on your body, twerkin' on your body, work
Twerk on your body, twerk on your body, work
He said, "twerk on me, mami, twerk on me, mami, work"
I ain't take you home, I just came to twerk and flirt
I ain't take you home, I just came to twerk and flirt
