How can you expect me to stay
After all the things you've done?
I don't wanna feel this anymore, no
Why do you expect to be forgiven because you're a man?
Are your excuses worth much more?

What if I told you I was out loving another man?
What if I told you it didn't mean a thing?
What if I told you that I loved you so, but these hoes, I can't let go?
Could you handle all the things that you told me?
How 'bout some reverse psychology?

Oh-oh
How 'bout some reverse psychology, yeah?
Oh-oh-oh

After the conversation we had
After all the moments we shared
How could you do these things to me?
(These things to me)
Like love was supposed to make me stand by
And watch you tell me those lies
Why would you do me that way?
