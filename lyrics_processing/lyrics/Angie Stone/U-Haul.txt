Bet you realize this time that
When you see my friends sitting outside they were
There to help me pack my bags and
Tell me don't listen to you if you're beggin
Cause they know I'm coming straight back home to you
And they know I'm a constant fool for you
So I'm putting my things on a U-haul
And I'm blockin out your number when you call

No conversation you can keep your words
Cause 90% I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
I'm letting you know it's not exceptional
And No conversation you can save the games
And anything you say I will remain the same
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
Destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional
You might also like
I can't believe you even tried to blame me
Cause you're the one who changed
I've been the same me
And I been by your side like a 2 way
And like a pager with no clamp
That's how you lose me
So my friends come to help me get over you
Cause they're sick and tired of seeing what I'm going through
I put all of my things on a U-haul
And I won't' accept at all whenever you call

No conversation you can keep your words
Cause 90% I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
I'm letting you know it's not exceptional
And No conversation you can save the games
And anything you say I will remain the same
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
Destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

I should have left you're ass long time ago
(I should have left you)
I was too scared to be out on my own
(Cause you made me feel like)
You made me feel there was no other way
(I would never find another)
That I wouldn't find love, I would be lonely
Cause you, you (made) made (me) me (feel so damn low)
So low, low low, low low, low low
Now take a look at what's happening
This is tragic like when Michael left The Jacksons
I told you, you should be careful what you're asking
You wished I would've left you with some quiet time
But now you got more time than any time
I know you never thought that I would jet out
But I left before you could tell me "Get out"

No conversation you can keep your words
Cause 90% I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
I'm letting you know it's not exceptional
And No conversation you can save the games
And anything you say I will remain the same
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
Destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

This is tragic, y'all
Oh lord
One more time
