{Rufus} Hey baby
{Angie} I think I wanna just rap to ya for just a second
{Rufus} 'Bout what
{Angie} Cuz there's some things we got to change
In order to move forward
{Rufus} Whatchu talking about?
{Angie} Because I believe in you
{Rufus} You believe in me?
{Angie} All things are possible
{Rufus} Uh huh
{Angie} You just chill, stand still
{Rufus} Aight, I'm right here
{Angie} First things first
{Rufus} Right
Don't go working my nerve
Over something that you heard
Don't be dissing my name
Cause you slipped up on your game
Don't be making me cry
Turn around and apologize
Stop pretending to be
Something you're not

Cause you got mad issues
And you tend to misuse
Every opportunity to right your wrongs
You're causing more problems
With no way to solve them
The time has come to leave well enough alone
You got mad issues
And you tend to abuse
Every opportunity to make it good
You're causing more problems
With no way to solve them
Time has come, and boy I really wish you would
You might also like
Don't be acting like me
You've been rich all of your life
Don't be breaking crews
Cause you've had it good for some time
Use a masquerade
And stop blowing me shame
Stop pretending to be
Somebody you're not

Cause you got mad issues
And you tend to misuse
Every opportunity to right your wrongs
You're causing more problems
With no way to solve them
The time has come to leave well enough alone
You got mad issues
And you tend to abuse
Every opportunity to make it good
You're causing more problems
With no way to solve them
Time has come, and boy I really wish you would

And I never would've thought you was all about your game
Now you got to go to where you came
Confusing the brain, it's all from the pain
Nothing to gain, out of my rein
Too late to make a change, don't say my name
Cause you got mad issues
And you tend to misuse
Every opportunity to right your wrongs
You're causing more problems
With no way to solve them
The time has come to leave well enough alone
You got mad issues
And you tend to abuse
Every opportunity to make it good
You're causing more problems
With no way to solve them
