Cal, yo, baby, I believe it's your time, ha
Uh, huh, with Angie 'cause I believe in you
Listen

Lookin' back, reminiscing on
Caught up really doing bad, then you put me on
Told me not to be ashamed of what I got
Never mind I'm hatin' niggas up and down the block, babe
Had it down and bills got paid
Said go ahead baby, do the same thing
And when God blesses us, I want a Lexus
With a hideaway mansion in the Hampton

Girl, you must've lost your way from heaven
Could it be for me you came so far?
Nothing like the ordinary woman
You're the very beat inside my heart
Girl, you're like a star I feel so common
Shining like a diamond out in space
Girl, you're like my mother, my sister, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place
You're the blood in my veins
You're the air I breathe on a hot summer day
You're like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
More than a woman to me
If you take that back there would be no cure
I'd sail there forever like a ship with no shore
What makes me a man any fool could see
More than a woman to me
You might also like
Look at us, livin' in luxury
And I've been thinking maybe we should start a family, oh
A girl for you and a boy for me
Matching stones, set baguettes, would you marry me baby
And if you'll have me I'd gladly give my life
Today I take this vow to make you my wife
Nothing temporary no it's quite contrary
It's you and me for eternity

Boy, you must've lost your way from heaven
Could it be for me you came so far?
Nothing like the ordinary brother
You're the very beat inside my heart
Boy, you're like a star I feel so common
Shining like a diamond out in space
Something like my father, my brother, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place
(Boy, you're mine)
You're the blood in my veins
You're the air I breathe on a hot summer day
You're like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
More than a woman to me
If you take that back there would be no cure
I'd sail there forever like a ship with no shore
What makes me a man any fool could see
More than a woman to me
You're the blood in my veins
You're the air I breathe on a hot summer day
You're like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
More than a woman to me
If you take that back there would be no cure
I'd sail there forever like a ship with no shore
What makes me a man any fool could see
More than a woman to me
If you're certain about it, oh yeah
Baby, you're the essence of my life
Wanna make you my wife, yeah baby
Oh Lord, baby I love you
My my my baby, my my my baby, yeah yeah
Said you're my baby, whoa yeah
I know there was something about you
Girl I love you

You're the blood in my veins
You're the air I breathe on a hot summer day
You're like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
More than a woman to me
If you take that back there would be no cure
I'd sail there forever like a ship with no shore
What makes me a man any fool could see
