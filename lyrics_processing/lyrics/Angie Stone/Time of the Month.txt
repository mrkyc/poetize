It's three o'clock in the morning
Tell me where you been
See, I'm in pain, these migraines
And my cramps are getting near
Don't wanna hear your stories
Don't wanna hear your lies
Let me go to bed, swallow my pride
'Cause you be sleeping outside

It's that time of the month (time of the month)
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me

I go to work all week
Overtime I'm puttin' in
Now here's a mess, 'cause I get my check
And there's money missin'
So many things to do
And now I'm wondering how
They tell me wait 'til they get it straight
But my bills are due right now, right now

It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me (oh, Lord)
It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month (just leave me alone)
Don't even mess with me

Oh, let's keep it real
People don't care how you feel
Every little thing (every thing), God may heal it
Where's a piece of mind
When you need it, oh Lord
When does it
I can't be bothered, not even with my friends
There's a lot of things going through my head
Just wanna go home and go to bed

It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me (see, my head is hurting)
It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me (time, time)
It's that time of the month (leave me alone)
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month (don't mess with me, no)
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month (It's that time of the month)
Don't even mess with me
It's that time of the month
