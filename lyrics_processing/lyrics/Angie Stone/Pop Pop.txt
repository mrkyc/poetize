We're chilling again
I want to be, more than a friend
Cause you taken me to places I never been before
Feeling like I'm yearning for a little more
And(DAMN) I want to begin to build with you, Let it do what it do Cause we been talkin and kissing and touching like every night
And if that's wrong I don't want to be right

Look what u done, making me run, straight to your arms
Boy you know you only get the best of me
Flowing like a book full of poetry (DAMN)
I'm thanking your mother for making your brother... tell her I love her
Baby you know you're everything I need
You're the missing link to me...
