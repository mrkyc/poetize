Uh, yeah, try to be cool
Tired, feeling all that, you know what I'm sayin'?
Positive, you know what I'm sayin'?

So pissed off
Lookin' at life through the glass that you shattered
Little shit like love doesn't matter anymore
Baby, what's up?
Nigga, you so ticked off
Can't let up long enough to get over it
Brotha can I live? Can a sister live? Goddamn
So pissed off (so pissed off)
Lookin' at life through the glass that you shattered
Little shit like love doesn't matter anymore
Baby, what's up?
Nigga, you so ticked off
Can't let up long enough to get over it
Brotha can I live? Can a sister live? Goddamn

I tried to find a tree where we could lay happily
In the shade, gradually there were things revealed to me
I can't even hold down a job, tryna follow up and behind me
You're over-protective and you're jealous
Change when you're around the fellows
Every man I speak to, something's goin' on
Look at you, look at you, running around like a damn fool
So busy accusing me when it's your insecurity

You need an inner appeal so your anger just relieve
I never meant to cause you pain
But it was there before I came
Makin' crazy accusations, tracing all of my footsteps
For overreactin', got me packin'
Tryna get out before you get back in
Look at me, look at me, I can't allow you to live rent free
In my heart or in my head, can't let you back in my bed

Baby, what's wrong with you?
What's got you so pissed off?
Can't get along with you
Love, I got to move on
My love, gotta get him outta my life
Can't let you go on with it
Now 'cause you pissin' me off
I don't wanna be stressed out
I don't wanna be stressed out
My life, back in my life
