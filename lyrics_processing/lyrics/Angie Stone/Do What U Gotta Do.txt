Singing about tomorrow, I'm wishing this day would past
My problems weighing me down, but I know they will not last
Searching for the answers, all along they've been so near
I took a trip down in my soul and put aside all of my fears
I said
Go ahead now you, can make it
Do what you gotta do, do what you gotta do, baby
Keep your head up, you can make it
Do what you gotta do
Go on now, you can make it, do what you gotta do
Go ahead now , you can make it
Do what you gotta do, do what you gotta do
No longer will I be afraid
I had step out -n-depend on faith
I wanted to give back what HE gave to me
So, I opened up my mind, opened up my heart
And made a brand new start
I sang from my soul, passion kept me holding on
Go ahead now you, can make it
Do what you gotta do, do what you gotta do
Keep your head up, you can make it
Do what you gotta do
Go on now, you can make it, do what you gotta do
You can make it, if you do what you got to do
Do what you gotta do
