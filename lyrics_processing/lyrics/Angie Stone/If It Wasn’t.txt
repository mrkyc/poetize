If it wasn't for yo' momma
Never thinkin' I was good enough
If it wasn't for yo' brotha
Always checkin' every move I gave up
If it wasn't for that bitch
Down the block always in yo' ear
Be no room for messin' up
But baby love, you'd be right here

Tell me why must I, since they bought us things
Suffer indefinitely for loving you
Sugar why must I prove to anybody but you
Feel I been chosen to loose
I paid my dues, oh

If it wasn't for yo' momma
Never thinkin' I was good enough
If it wasn't for yo' brotha
Always checkin' every move I gave up
If it wasn't for that bitch
Down the block always in yo' ear
Be no room for messin' up
But baby love, you'd be right here
You might also like
I'd been lying too, if I said to you
That they're pressuring me away from you
It's that she's run this
Got us fighting over dumbness
Got my heart on some numbness
That's your momma and I can't take it (no more)
I gets no joy but when I hurt
So when it hurts, it really hurts

If it wasn't for yo' momma
Never thinkin' I was good enough
If it wasn't for yo' brotha
Always checkin' every move I gave up
If it wasn't for that bitch
Down the block always in yo' ear
Be no room for messin' up
But baby love, you'd be right here

Gotta learn to keep your family out the game
When you're trying to do your thing
They got more that's due
Just cuz momma fed you right all your life
Don't mean she walk on a perfect line
Watch your step, or pay the price, sacrifice
Mothers sisters fathers brothers
Cousin's aunts and uncles too
You know them be the main cause
Just because we know them
Doesn't mean that they ain't workin' you
Always it's something something something goin' on

If it wasn't for yo' momma
Never thinkin' I was good enough
If it wasn't for yo' brotha
Always checkin' every move I gave up
If it wasn't for that bitch
Down the block always in yo' ear
Be no room for messin' up
