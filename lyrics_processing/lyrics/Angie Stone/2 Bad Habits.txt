I got two, I got two, I got two

I say some things, make a sailor blush
Hang with some chicks that I can't really trust
Hot on myself about the way I look
But can't nobody tell me that I don't look good
I take my time when I'm running late
Then cuss them out if they just can't wait
I know I'm petty for the things I do
But this ain't really nothing new

I catch myself all the time, without even thinking
I be calling your line, hope you don't laugh
And call me silly, silly
For feeling you

I always start off pouring one glass of wine
And automatically pour another one when I'm done
Somehow I always end up tipsy every time
It's just a bad habit of mine
But I got two bad habits, two bad habits
And the other one is you, babe, you babe
Can't get enough of you, babe, you baby
You might also like
Ain't nothing that a pedicure can't cure
Bag and some heels let me chill, got the bill
Collectors acting funny, more month than the money
I'm watching what I spend so what's that in the window?
Take a little of my savings, move it over to my checking
But the way my account is set up
Hope that it clears
Or I'll be in tears

I catch myself all the time, without even thinking
I be calling your line, hope you don't laugh
And call me silly, silly
For feeling you

I always start off pouring one glass of wine
And automatically pour another one when I'm done
Somehow I always end up tipsy every time
It's just a bad habit of mine
But I got two bad habits, two bad habits
And the other one is you, babe, you babe
Can't get enough of you, babe, you baby

You're like caffeine going through my bloodstream
I'm clinging like a fiend to my nicotine
If I can't see you at all, I'm going through withdraws, I
Just can't get enough of you, babe
You're like sweet, brown sugar to a diabetic
Got me overdosing, I'ma need a paramedic
Yeah I said it
If I can't see you at all, I'm going through withdraws, I
Just can't get enough of you, baby
I always start off pouring one glass of wine
And automatically pour another one when I'm done
Somehow I always end up tipsy every time
It's just a bad habit of mine
But I got two bad habits, two bad habits
And the other one is you, babe, you babe
