You're gonna find what you're looking for
Keep on digging through the dirt, girl
Just leave them bones where they at now
And wash your hands in the faucet
You only gonna exhaust yourself
She was way before you met
He gon' say, "What you bringin' up the past for?
Bringin' up old shit. Dinosaur."

You're gonna find what you're looking for
Keep doing that research
And when it surface, it's gonna hurt
And now you trying to figure out what's worse
Look at you, mad again
But you can't be mad at him
He gon' say, "What you bringin' up the past for?
Bringin' up old shit. Dinosaur."

Congratulations

You wonder where do the good ones go?
They're on the verge of extinction
But you got one sitting right at home
Whenever you can't reach him

Shorty, that was your mistake

(You bringing up the past for?)
Bringin' up old shit. Dinosaur."

Why you play a game you gonna lose?
It's chess not checkers
Think through your moves
Why make accusations that you just can't prove?
