What a surprise
I thought I never hear from you again ( you left me) with tears in my eyes
When you told that you didn't want this anymore
Your action spoke louder than words
Your silence I heard
The only thing worse is hearing you now
Plant your seeds of doubt
When the love I found
Is on solid ground
CHORUS
Why is it (whooo)
Now that I'm in love
And found someone now you want me
The way you know I use to want you
But it's too late because we're through
Why is it
Someone else had to love me
For you see all that I could be
This love for me has new meaning
And when you find it you never ever let it go
VERSE 2
Now that things good
You telling me you could
Be understanding of the things you shoulda understood
Sorry but I'm not who you knew when you broke my heart into
Your action spoke louder than words
Your silence I heard
The only thing worse is hearing you now
Plant your seeds of doubt
When the love I found
Is on solid ground

Why is it (oh yeaah)
Now that I'm in love
And found someone now you want me
All i gave of me were things you asked me - but -wasn't enough
Don't want disappoint you but don't waste your time cuz
Love's got hold on my heart-body- soul - and mind
There's no need call me anymore
If you are looking for - the love we had don't live here any more
CHORUS
Why is it
Now that I'm in love
And found someone now you want me
The way you know I use to want you
But it's too late because we're through
Why is it
Someone else had to love me
For you see all that I could be
This love for me has new meaning
And when you find it you never ever let it go
Baby I'm yeah, said I'm good yeah
Hope you find somebody to love you like i did
