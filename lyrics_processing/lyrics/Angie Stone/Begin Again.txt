This ain't going to work for us
We back out here at 30+
Back up in the club, brushing off the dust
I'm out of touch, don't know who to trust
New clothes and cologne, I'm up in the gym
I'm out with her, you out with him
Just put a new one and woo her again
And I just called because I was wondering

Can we (begin again)
Girl I don't want to free no more
And I just called because I was wondering
Can we (begin again)
You got me spoiled, baby
These hoes ain't loyal
I called because I been wondering, baby

I know we can win, baby, if we begin again
Or never cry again, baby, if we begin again
Tell me where or when, I'll be there to begin again
I called because I was wondering, baby

Pictures worth a thousand likes
No filter with my girls tonight
All I hear is loose (all our dresses tight)
Night after night, I ain't about this life no more
All the men my age got wise, on baby mama four or five
Looking for something on the side
It's rough out here
I think it's worth giving us another try

Boy I ain't trying to be free, this ain't for me
And I just called because I was wondering
Can we (begin again)
I don't say boy fuck your fears
I got me a real
I called because I been wondering, baby

I know we can win, baby, if we begin again
Or never cry again, baby, if we begin again
Tell me where or when, I'll be there to begin again
And I just called because I was wondering

You're trying to reel her in, what you feeling like?
You out here trying to get chose every night
We should just get back where we're supposed to be
Because I'm not over you and you're not over me
We're trying to reel it in, what you feeling like?
We out here trying to get chose every night
We should just get back where we're supposed to be
Because I'm not over you and you, you're not over me

Boy I ain't trying to be free, this ain't for me
And I just called because I was wondering
Can we (begin again)
I don't say boy fuck your fears
I got me a real
I called because I was wondering, baby
I know we can win, baby, if we begin again
Or never cry again, baby, if we begin again
Tell me where or when, I'll be there to begin again
And I just called because I was wondering

I'm desperate, baby
I need you, baby
