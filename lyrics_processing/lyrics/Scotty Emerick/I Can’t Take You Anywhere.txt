You've been a part of my life so very long
It's hard for me to believe sometimes you're really gone
I tuck your memory away in my special hiding place
Hopin' no one could tell by the look on my face
That you're still in my heart, and always on my mind
And a part of my everyday

Like just last night I went out for a bite
And I tried to have fun with all my might
But even the laughter, it wasn't much of a break
'Cause right in the middle of my strawberry shake
Bobby Joe walked in with a couple of friends
And said, "Hey have you heard from her at all man, like
Where's she been?"

And it struck a nerve, and it hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
This broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me
But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
And are you comin' back again, I swear
I can't take you anywhere
You might also like
So I left all alone, I just headed on home
As I listened to the messages on my telephone
There was one from my sister
And one from an old friend
He said, "I drove by your house tonight dude but
You weren't in
Just checkin' up on you boy, I hope you're doin' alright
Oh by the way man, I seen her last night"

And it, struck a nerve, and it, hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
This broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me
But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you comin' back again, I swear
I can't take you anywhere

I swear, I can't take you, just can't take you
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere, oh no
I can't take you anywhere, no no no no no no no no no no
