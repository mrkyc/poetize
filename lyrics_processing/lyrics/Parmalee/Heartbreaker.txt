She makes the ice melt before she ever takes a sip
Yeah, you can feel the heat when she walks by
Makes a five alarm fire look like a dollar store lighter flame, yeah
She'll skip the needle on the groove with the way she moves
Make you drop a beat when she starts to dance
And if she takes you by the hand
You know it's only gonna end one way, her way

And all the boys light up like a left-hand high
Got 'em buying her drinks on a Saturday night
No ninety proof Kentucky gonna let 'em get lucky tonight
She's gonna turn 'em all on when she's doing her thing
Yeah, she'll wind 'em all up just to cut them strings
She's a little heartbreaker
But that little heartbreaker's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

She makes a grown man fall down to his knees
Begging baby please for just one hit
Of that heaven on her lips
Tripping for a kiss that's walking away, ay, ay, ay, ay

And all the boys light up like a left-hand high
Got 'em buying her drinks on a Saturday night
No ninety proof Kentucky gonna let 'em get lucky tonight
She's gonna turn 'em all on when she's doing her thing
Yeah, she'll wind 'em all up just to cut them strings
She's a little heartbreaker
But that little heartbreaker's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

All the boys light up like a left-hand high
