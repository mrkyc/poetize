You've been sipping that wine on your back porch
All by yourself for way too long
You've been putting off getting out, shaking it off
And thinking 'bout moving on
No there ain't nothing worse than the way that it hurts
Your heart gets broke but the beat don't stop
Might still be cracked but it still works so let's dust it off

It's time to get back in the game, girl
'Cause Friday night's missing you, can't you hear it calling your name
It'd be such a shame, if you let one more night go by
Without showing everybody who the boss is
I got the perfect thing to kick it off with
A little late night neon light with some Dixie champagne, girl
It's time to get you back in the game, girl

You're way too pretty to be sitting on the sideline
Baby, there ain't no doubt
That you're the kind when you walk through the door, girl
Everybody's checking you out
In your little party dress, such a beautiful mess
There ain't no way that you don't know that
You were made to make me a wreck
C'mon, let's go

'Cause Friday night's missing you, can't you hear it calling your name

Time to get you back in the game, girl

'Cause Friday night's missing you, can't you hear it calling your name
It'd be such a shame, if you let one more night go by
Without showing everybody who the boss is
I got the perfect thing to kick it off with
A little corner bar, come fill it up with some Dixie champagne, girl
It's time to get you back in the game, girl
Time to get you back in the game, girl
You're back in the game, girl
