Everybody's got that girl, you know the one that got away
I really don't know why but I was thinking 'bout her today
I loved the way she'd say Georgia
With that sweet little southern drawl
And how she whispered "baby"
As the mossy oak shadows would fall
If whiskey was a time machine, I would try to drink her back to me

There are highways and byways
Running east, west, north, and south
And you can sail into the harbor, see the planes touching down
But I burned up every bridge
Just like Sherman did coming down from Atlanta
And I know there ain't no way back to Savannah, no, no, oh, woah

Yeah, I had some big city dreams, headed out on my own
To the bright lights and the neon sky, left her there all alone
This photograph is the only map as a memory disappears
And the truth is you can't get there from here

'Cause there are highways and byways
Running east, west, north, and south
And you can sail into the harbor, see the planes touching down
But I burned up every bridge
Just like Sherman did coming down from Atlanta
And I know there ain't no way back to Savannah, no, no, oh, woah

Yeah
If whiskey was a time machine I would try to drink her back to me

'Cause there are highways and byways
Running east, west, north, and south
And you can sail into the harbor, see the planes touching down
But I burned up every bridge
Just like Sherman did coming down from Atlanta
And I know there ain't no way back to Savannah
No, no, no, oh, woah
No, no, no, oh, woah

Everybody's got that girl, I've got mine in black and white
