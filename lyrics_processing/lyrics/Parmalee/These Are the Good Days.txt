Pay check burning out, count spare change in the ash tray
But I got you and you got me
And baby that's all we'll ever need
These are the good days
These are the one we'll talk about
These are the long nights
Watching the sun rise
Over the edge of this small town
These are the best song
Yeah the ones we'll always sing
These are the first times
The slow climbs
The lights that never fade
Yeah these are the good days
These are the good days
Just one bed and one bath, old walls, new paint
Your hair in my face, your lips, my name
But I got you and you got me
And baby that's all we'll ever need
These are the good days
These are the one we'll talk about
These are the long nights
Watching the sun rise
Over the edge of this small town
These are the best song
Yeah the ones we'll always sing
These are the first times
The slow climbs
The lights that never fade
Yeah these are the good days
These are the good days
