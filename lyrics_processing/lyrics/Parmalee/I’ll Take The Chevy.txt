You from the uptown, I'm from the way out
Somehow, it seems to work
Yeah, your nails are painted, my jeans are faded
Grass stained, covered in dirt

Hey, hey
They say opposites attract (Uh-huh)
Hey, hey
We're livin' proof of that

You take the pool, I'll take the pond
You lay on the beach, I'll lay on the lawn
You wear the Gucci, I'll wear the Carhart
You watch the Housewives, I'll watch some NASCAR
You drive the highway, I'll sling the mud
You sip the champagne, I'll drink the Bud
You bump the Bieber, I'll crank the Petty
You take the Bimmer, I'll take the Chevy

Hey (Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin')
I'll take the Chevy (Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin')
You take the Bimmer, I'll take the Chevy

It ain't hard like math, you see
It's about as easy as one, two, three
Little bit of you plus a little bit of me
Equals that backwood luxury

You take the pool, I'll take the pond
You lay on the beach, I'll lay on the lawn
You wear the Gucci, I'll wear the Carhart
You watch the Housewives, I'll watch some NASCAR
You drive the highway, I'll sling the mud
You sip the champagne, I'll drink the Bud
You bump the Bieber, I'll crank the Petty
You take the Bimmer, I'll take the Chevy

Hey (Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin')
I'll take the Chevy (Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin')
You take the Bimmer, I'll take the Chevy
