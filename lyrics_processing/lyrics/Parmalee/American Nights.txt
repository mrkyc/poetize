Yeah, American nights coming out of that dash
Going big time on a little bit of cash
Ain't nothing better, no there ain't nothing like
American nights

Somewhere out there in America
There's a long haul driver filling up
And a welcome back home party, twelve ounce toast
Carolina toes on a California coast
At the coast the sun is going down
Feels like nothing two-lane towns
Parts on a hood down airport road
Seeing how high they can go

Yeah, American nights coming out of that dash
Going big time on a little bit of cash
Raising one up and singing along
Living the words to all those songs
American nights lighting up that sky
That bottle-rocket going off look in her eyes
Ain't nothing better, no there ain't nothing like
American nights
Yeah, these American nights

Lipstick painting on your baby's lips
Overtime working that graveyard shift
Corner booth kiss in a downtown bar
Kids driving around in daddy's car
Mama staying up, steady watching the clock
Everybody hide, here come the cops
Hearts on fire, whiskey on ice, year
Just another slice

Of American nights coming out of that dash
Going big time on a little bit of cash
Raising one up and singing along
Living the words to all those songs
American nights lighting up that sky
That bottle-rocket going off look in her eyes
Ain't nothing better, no there ain't nothing like
American nights
Woah, and at the end of a long, hard day
Woah, you know we just can't wait

For those American nights coming out of that dash
Going big time on a little bit of cash
Raising one up and singing along
Living the words to all those songs
American nights lighting up that sky
That bottle-rocket going off look in her eyes
Ain't nothing better, no there ain't nothing like
American nights
Yeah, these American nights
Yeah, American nights
