He didn't wanna make the time for you (Nope)
He never told you how he felt
He never laid it on the line for you (Damn)
And if he did, you couldn't tell

But if you were mine, I'd tell you every day
A million different times in a million different ways
I would stick around from the start to the finish
And I ain't even mad at the fact that he didn't

'Cause, baby, I do, baby, I do
Wanna give you everything under that moon
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I can guarantee you that's what I'm gonna be
Lettin' go of you's kinda hard to imagine
Guess he never knew what he had when he had it
But, baby, I do, baby, I do
Ah yeah, baby, I do

I wanna take you back to your hometown (That's right)
Ride them roads that you rolled down (Skrrt, skrrt)
Do some hangin' out with your home crowd (Let's go)
And meet your mom and them too
