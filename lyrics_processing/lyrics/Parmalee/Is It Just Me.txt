Do you think that we made a mistake or is it just me?

Glad you picked up, yeah, I just called to ask how you've been
Yeah, I know it's late, you know this ain't no accident
No, I ain't been drinkin', just thinkin' 'bout you last couple days
Hope it don't sound crazy but maybe I could ask you a few things

Does it turn your head when you hear my name?
Do you change that song every time it plays?
Do you drive real slow goin' by my street?
Tell me, girl, or is it just me?
Do you not go out if I might be there?
Cross your mind out of nowhere?
Would you go right back like it used to be?
Do you think that we made a mistake or is it just me?
(Or is it just, or is it just)

Better when I'm thinkin' back 'bout things we used to do
'Cause it's okay if you say that it's just me missin' you
I know we said goodbye but I tried and I just can't let you go
Am I the only lonely one oh, girl, I just gotta know

Is it just me sittin' here thinkin' that we might've messed up
Maybe now we ain't where we're s'pposed to be

Do you see my face when you sleep at night?
Do you kiss someone but it don't feel right?
Do you wanna be more than a memory?
Or is it just me?
