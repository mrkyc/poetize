I had a fake ID that looked nothin' like me
But my Jeep looked sweet up on thirty-three's
I 'member chokin' on smokes down at the creek
And braggin' 'bout kissin' that homecomin' queen

Back in the day, we were small town stars
Snuck a little beer, cranked a lotta Garth
Down on the farm, out on the lake, livin' it up, we did it our way
Back in the day, we were draggin' the strip
Waitin' on green, pop the clutch, let it rip
Tryin' to get lucky with a honey on a Friday night after the game
Back in the day

Heads and tails on a fifty yard line
Puttin' buck shot holes on a county road sign
Yeah, I fell in love a couple times
A couple of them girls still cross my mind

Back in the day, we were small town stars
Snuck a little beer, cranked a lotta Garth
Down on the farm, out on the lake, livin' it up, we did it our way
Back in the day, we were draggin' the strip
Waitin' on green, pop the clutch, let it rip
Tryin' to get lucky with a honey on a Friday night after the game
Back in the day
Back in the day

There ain't nothin' really changed, naw
We're still doin' it up the same way
Just like we did, yeah, back in the day

'Cause back in the day, we were small town stars
Snuck a little beer, cranked a lotta Garth
Down on the farm, out on the lake, livin' it up, we did it our way
Back in the day, we were draggin' the strip
Waitin' on green, pop the clutch, let it rip
Tryin' to get lucky with a honey on a Friday night after the game
Back in the day

Oh oh woah
Not a care, don't worry 'bout a thing
Oh oh woah
As long as we had gas in the tank
Oh oh woah
That's how we did it, back in the day
