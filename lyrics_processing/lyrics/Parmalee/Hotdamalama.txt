She got that drop the hammer
She got that talking ya'll knock at ya'll country grammar
She got that south side Amen dialed in
Hotter than a summer tent revival down in Alabama
Sweet home, sweet home turn it up
Ought to be a law against the way she keeps on backing it up

Oh yeah, she's every bit of all that
Oh yeah, that girl is like a first class high dollar ticket
On the Chattanooga (choo-choo)
Can I get a (woo-woo, woo-woo)
Oh yeah, she kicks it like a rocket
Cutoffs clinging to her pocket
Talking 'bout a home run grand slamalamalama
Front to back jack picture perfect panorama
She's a super fine reason to rhyme

Panama city, wet T-shirt, Miss Banana
(Boats, boats) motor-boating
Man it's a handful juggling all these emotions
