I see you and him in the corner
Talking to a couple friends
But he don't laugh
When you laugh
Turn every head when you walk in
You light up this whole room
He ain't got a clue
What he's about to lose

You got that fire, but he don't say a thing
You're like sunshine, he's all rain
So damn tired of watching him watch you fade
I could put a new taste on your lips
Melt your heart with my fingertips
Give you the kind of love that puts him in the past
Burn this memory like a photograph

I watch him walk to the cooler
And grab himself a cold one, just one
And walk outside, talk on his phone
And just stay gone all night long
If it was me that was on your hand, girl
You know I'd never let it go
'Cause I know what he don't
He can't see nothing but I see smoke

You got that fire, but he don't say a thing
You're like sunshine, he's all rain
So damn tired of watching him watch you fade
I could put a new taste on your lips
Melt your heart with my fingertips
Give you the kind of love that puts him in the past
Burn this memory like a photograph

You got that fire, and I want to test that flame
I could put a new taste on your lips
Melt your heart with my fingertips
Give you the kind of love that puts him in the past
Burn this memory like a photograph
I could put a new taste on your lips
Melt your heart with my fingertips
Give you the kind of love that puts him in the past
