Summertime and no flip-flops
A little country a little rock, yea, yea
Dirt roads and dashboard lights
Fool around on a Friday night
Them jeans that fit just right, yea, yea

I'll bring the music, you bring the beer
We're gonna kick this thing in gear
Come on now and get your hands in the air
Sayin' yea (yea)
Yea, I'll turn it up and you turn it on
We got a right to do no wrong
You bring a case of whatever makes you move it
And I'll bring the music
Small towns and pickup trucks
Concerts and dixie cups
Good songs and holding 'em up, yea, yea
You and that sexy smile
When kisses are drivin' me wild
So hot that there ain't no mild, yea, yea
Yea
I'll bring the music, you bring the beer
We're gonna kick this thing in gear
Come on now and get your hands in the air
Sayin' yea (yea)
Yea, I'll turn it up and you turn it on
We got a right to do no wrong
You bring a case of whatever makes you move it
And I'll bring the music
