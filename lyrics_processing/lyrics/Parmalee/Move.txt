Hey, like to ride around and listen to that steel guitar sound
On whiskey bent and hell-bound with a little nice set brunette from FLA
Wheels turning, winding down in the pines, KC lights lightin' up tonight
Iced down and a cool, cold beer callin' my name
Hey, like my pontoons?
Cuttin' that liquid glass so smooth
On the lake forty HP every noon
Girls tannin' on the bow-wow, keep it 'tween the banks
Makin' my way, not a cloud in sky, inline flint shades on my eyes
Aw hell, got the JBL so loud, you can't think
Yeah, kick back
Oh, one hand on the wheel
Give it a little bit of juice
Life goin' by so slow and easy
Don't that just make you want to move?
Aw, turtle wax on, wax off
Good years serving in the armor-all
Tin's so dark, ticks off the lawn
Got the chrome rim slicker than a nickle, now we're ready to roll
One real quick stop, top off the tank
Baby wants a little somethin' cold to drink
Now, we slip down the strip like we're on Friday night patrol

Oh, one hand on the wheel
Give it a little bit of juice
Life goin' by so slow and easy
Don't that just make you want to move?
(Yeah, don't that make you wanna move?)
Weekend, speedin' into thirty-five
Rollin' 'round town, got nothin' but time
Baby kissing on me, runnin' off the road
Trying to keep it cool, rolling with the flow
Kick back
Oh, one hand on the wheel
Give it a little bit of juice
Life goin' by so slow and easy
Don't that just make you want to-
Kick back
Oh, one hand on the wheel
Give it a little bit of juice
Life goin' by so slow and easy
Don't that just make you want to move?
