In my T-shirt, in my ride
Runnin' circles in my mind
Couple billion in the world
Baby, you're the only girl in mine

You took the single out of my life
Now I can't wait to see you tonight
In my CJ seat, messin' with my rear view
No, I don't feel like me, girl, if I ain't got you

In my T-shirt, in my ride
Runnin' circles in my mind
Couple billion in the world
Baby, you're the only girl
In that picture in my pocket
On my cell phone when I lock it
It's all you, no lie
Baby, you're the only girl in mine

(You're the only girl in)

Nah, there ain't nothin' I want to myself
If it's up to me, there'd never be nobody else
In that blue beach chair by my side in the sun
Don't even wanna be there, girl, if you ain't the one

In my T-shirt, in my ride
Runnin' circles in my mind
Couple billion in the world
Baby, you're the only girl
In that picture in my pocket
On my cell phone when I lock it
It's all you, no lie
Baby, you're the only girl

In my head when I'm dreamin'
In my Friday every weekend
All my days, my nights
Baby, you're the only girl in mine
Yeah, you're the only girl in mine

You took the single, mm, out of my life
Now, girl, you'll always be the only one I wanna see

Up in my T-shirt, in my ride
Runnin' circles in my mind
Couple billion in the world
Baby, you're the only girl
In that picture in my pocket
On my cell phone when I lock it
It's all you, no lie
Baby, you're the only girl in mine
You're the only girl in mine
