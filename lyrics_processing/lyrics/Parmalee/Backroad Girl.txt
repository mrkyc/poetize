She could be on a front porch
Little Keith Whitley on vinyl through the screen door
Or down a crush and run gravel driveway
Couple miles off the highway (Yeah)
Or toppin' off at the Quick Stop
Glass bottle Coca-cola and a couple scratch-offs
South of out-there Tennessee
Maybe waitin' on a guy like me

I'm just a hometown boy lookin' for a backroad girl
Hair down, blowin' out the window
Just as pretty in Realtree as diamonds and pearls
Yeah, she loves a four-wheel drive floatin' down a two-lane
Singin' every word to a little bit of everything
Got a hometown boy in a small-town world
Ridin' round, lookin' for a backroad girl
Lookin' for a backroad girl (Backroad girl)

Ain't a compass that'll help me
Ain't a map I can tap that'll tell me, nah
Where she's at, where she's gonna be
Oh, wherever that is is where I wanna be
