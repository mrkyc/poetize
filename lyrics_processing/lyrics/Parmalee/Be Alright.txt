You look away from me, I see there' somethin' you're tryin' to hide
And I reach for your hand, but it's cold
You pull away again and I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble, and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter
Weren't your friends, you need some space
And I feel the color drainin' from my face
And my friends say, I know you love her, man, but it's too late
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away
Let her go, it'll be alright
So I still look back at all the messages you sent
I know it wasn't right, but it was messin' with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
When I touched your face, I could tell you're movin' on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feelin' of betrayal that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away
Let her go, it'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another, and you'll be just fine
Let her go
Nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal the love you're born to find
Nothin' heals the past like time
And they can't steal the love you're born to find
I know you love her, man, but it's too late
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away
Let her go, it'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go
It'll be alright, it'll be alright
