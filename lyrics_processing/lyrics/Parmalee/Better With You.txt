It could be a twelve pack
Throw it in the back of a Chevy kinda Friday night
It could be a lazy Sunday afternoon
Just watchin' those cars go by
It could be a low-rent hotel room
Or we could have a sunset beachfront view, yeah
Any time or town, baby, you know how
To turn it up a notch or two

You can take a two-lane town with no name
Turn it into Vegas lights
You can take a bad day, pourin' down rain
Turn it into clear blue skies
Yeah, you put the life in the party
You shine the light in the room
As long as we're together, don't matter what I do
It can be whatever, but it's always better with you

It could be an old T-shirt in the back of my drawer
Baby, 'til you slip it on
Just a song on the radio I don't know
Until you start singin' along
It could be my plain old camouflage hat
It could be a party I don't wanna be at
Baby, put you in it, don't even take a minute
Crazy how just like that

You can take a two-lane town with no name

You can take a bad day, pourin' down rain
Turn it into clear blue skies
Yeah, you put the life in the party
You shine the light in the room
As long as we're together, don't matter what I do
It can be whatever, but it's always better with you
It's always better with you

You put me in the mood
Put the full up in the moon
And the ninety in the proof
And I don't know how you do it (How you do it)
Like there ain't nothin' to it, nah

You can take a two-lane town with no name
Turn it into Vegas lights
You can take a bad day, pourin' down rain
Turn it into clear blue skies
Yeah, you put the life in the party
You shine the light in the room
As long as we're together, don't matter what I do
It can be whatever, but it's always better with you
