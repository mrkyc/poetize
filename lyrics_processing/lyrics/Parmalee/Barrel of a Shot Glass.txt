Here we are, so where do we go from here?
Should've known what I said
Would've brought us to the end of a dead end street
I know those eyes, I've seen those tears
You probably thinking that I'm leaving
And I'm looking for a reason just to find me somewhere

Staring down the barrel of a shot glass
Wondering how I'm ever gonna get you back
But I ain't falling in the same trap like I always do
I ain't leaving here tearing down the highway
How I did you wrong running on replay
No, I ain't drowning in the same past
Staring down the barrel of a shot glass

It ain't easy, so please believe me
When I tell you I'm a different man
I need for you to understand I'm trying to do the right thing
Let me hold you, let me show you
All that I can do is do everything to prove I'm not who I used to be

Staring down the barrel of a shot glass
Wondering how I'm ever gonna get you back
But I ain't falling in the same trap like I always do
I ain't leaving here tearing down the highway
How I did you wrong running on replay
No, I ain't drowning in the same past
Staring down the barrel of a shot glass

And by now I'd be too away from gone
And you'd be one foot out the door
But I ain't doing that anymore

Staring down the barrel of a shot glass
Wondering how I'm ever gonna get you back
But I ain't falling in the same trap like I always do
I ain't leaving here tearing down the highway
How I did you wrong running on replay
No, I ain't drowning in the same past
Staring down the barrel of a shot glass

No, I ain't drowning in the same past
