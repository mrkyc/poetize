A guy meets a girl
About three whiskeys in on a packed-out Friday night
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for nothing
But she had something that he liked
A guy meets a girl
Who kinda likes the way he talks that southern drawl
Those "y'all's" got her all caught up
In a crazy conversation about "Californication," yeah
'Cause the cover band was playing it

And that's how it starts, a couple beers in a bar
Turns into, "Can I get your number?"
Next thing you know, you love her, and then
You're sitting right where you never knew you wanted to be
You never saw her coming, now you never want her to leave
Ain't it crazy? It just might maybe
Change the whole world when

A guy meets a girl
For a second date, he couldn't hardly wait three days to call
Cleans out his truck, walks up to her doorstep
Thinks, "Aw, hell yeah," drops his jaw
They ride around in that small town
She's thinking white gowns, he's thinking
'bout a little house outside them city limits and them living in it

Turns into, "Can I get your number?"
Next thing you know, you love her, and then

You never saw her coming, now you never want her to leave
Ain't it crazy? It just might maybe
Change the whole world when

On down the road, a couple years or so
You know how the story goes
Hospital room 209, she's got her mama's eyes
And for the very first time
A guy meets a girl
A guy meets a girl

Yeah, that's how it starts, a couple beers in a bar
Turns into, "Can I get your number?"
Next thing you know, you love her, and then
You're sitting right where you never knew you wanted to be

Ain't it crazy? It just might maybe
Change the whole world when
