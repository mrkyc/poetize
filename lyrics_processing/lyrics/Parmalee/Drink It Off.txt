Cafe Patron, staring at your phone, getting your lonely on
Couldn't help but to see this empty seat here, baby
By the way, your friends just told me what you got going on

No, I don't want to crash your party
But they said that your were brokenhearted
Girl, I know it ain't your fault
Would you let help me you drink it off?

And if you wanna turn up, baby we can
Break out the lime and salt, I can help you drink it off
