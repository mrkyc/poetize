Said, I need a dollar (Yup), dollar (Yup), dollar (Yup)
That's what I need (Uh, yeah, yeah)
And If I share with you my story, would you share your dollar with me? (Yeah, yeah)

You see, I'm broke, I'm not tryna brag
About money, cars, hoes, jewelry and swag
I could be the first dude with the game in the bag
Who still lives home with his mom and his dad
Screw takin' a cab, I'll save my dough and get to joggin'
Yeah, my funds are that low
My car's dented up with some dirty-ass rims
My left headlight is duct-taped in
You think I'm jokin'? I wish
But I've also accepted the fact life is a bitch
And I ain't here to complain
But yo, I'm just sayin' that, uh, I'll take your dollar even if it's change
'Cause I've given you nothin' but free music
When I do release an album you can buy, please do it
Now there's a fan base followin' this character
About to show the world how to make it in America, uh
See Chris Webby LiveGet tickets as low as $58You might also like

You see, it don't matter, nationwide, everybody heard of me
'Cause my wallet still lacks American currency
Dudes be like, "Yo, you're not broke, son, you're famous"
Huh, and I'm still unsigned, you ignoramus
Boston's makin' money like Billy Costigan
While Webby's in CT grindin' for Washingtons
But it's straight, yo, I'm havin' a great time
And I realize some of these things take time
But I put out more hits than A-Rod
And gotta work a seven-dollar an hour day job
Don't have the money, but I have the skills and respect
That's worth more on the real, I'm the real deal
Soon enough, I'll have my fill and pay off all these late lawyer bills
About to have a mil' in the stash, for real, it's a fact
Need bills to the max, Evo, bring it back

And If I share with you my story, would you share your dollar with me? (Mac Miller)

Aight, look
I start my name with a capital "M"
You missed the start of the show, but you catchin' the end
MC's up in my cypher, come and show me love
Say, "Mac, look at you, kid, you really growin' up"
Before I ever had a video to look at
A bunch of weed and mixtapes fillin' up my book bag
Dealin', feelin' it, keepin' it real
One in a million, needed a feel
 stage, livin' aways
 livin' in City of Steel
There's a hundred billion rappers in the world, yeah, I'm one of many
Get this money, better understand me
No plan B, bitches no panties
Bunch of hoes tryna Facebook fan me
Platinum record, I get a Grammy
California Kush and parties in Miami
Got the game by the titty, she my nanny
Thumbs up, motherfucker, aha
