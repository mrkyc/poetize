Yeah
I don't wanna do it
But I feel like I got to

Good morning America, time to get to waking up
We've never all at once been confronted with so much crazy stuff
We should be able to find the truth, but they make it tough
You'd think the news would tell you, but most of that they've been making up
For anyone who's good, there's a John Wilkes Booth
All the Jedis lying dead, while the Sith grow roots
And if you try to speak the truth, they'll Anthony Bourdain you
Hang you and use suicide to explain you
We don't all need to agree, but how can you not see-
There's an elite and they fucking everyone like you and me?
That ain't race, color or creed, it's predatory greed
And if we don't unite, this might not be the land of the free-
For much longer, rights getting stripped real fast
While we fight each other, 'cause they want us just like that
We so divided by race, religion, color and class
Now it's who does and doesn't motherfucking wear a mask?
And the virus is real but it's seeming like they planned it
The way they're using it to their political advantage
I don't claim to have the answers but I'm telling you what
Bill Gates is mad sus, sketchy as fuck
2020 been some shit, fuckin' life got crazy
Bunch of trolls looking for someone to type at, angry
Y'all just hate on everybody, it's just like that lately
I got an auntie named Karen, she's a nice-ass lady
And I thought I was a liberal for most of my life
But holy Christ, you fucking lefties have been colder than ice
And I can't believe I'm saying it, honestly I hate this shit
But I got more in common with Trump supporters and Reagan-ists
Than fake woke bums cancelling everyone
We say one thing y'all don't like and our fucking career's done
No more open dialogue or conversation at all
No debate or discussion, what can I say? I'm appalled
'Cause if we're not allowed to talk or fucking have an opinion
Without you sensitive bitches enforcing public crucifixions
Then we're all fucked, so this is me speaking my peace
Shit, I would go down shooting for my freedom of speech
And that's the first two amendments loaded in one clip
Aiming at this broke political system we're stuck with
They got all our phones tapped so let 'em listen to this
Y'all recording? Suck my motherfucking dick, bitch

Raw thoughts
Here we go again, here we go again
These motherfucking raw thoughts
Here we go again, here we go again
Line 'em up

This motherfucker, Joe Biden
You dementia-ridden, geriatric, evil puppet, piece of dog-shit, old lying son of a bitch
Do y'all really think he's the answer?
They got to pump him full of drugs so he can speak on the camera
And this dumb, boomer Chuck Schumer' calling the shots
Saw him pull up just the other day and park in the lot
Went to say "Hi" and realized that this guy is such a fucking pussy
That he wore a fucking N95 while he drives
And Pelosi, that evil Golden Girl with her cronies
Ilhan Omar and A.O.C., all of you can blow me
And Kamala Harris too, I'll run a train on the whole fucking crew
No Scott Wiener, not including you
Weird shit going on, I mean Epstein, Ghislaine
Missing kids, adrenochrome, I don't know, I'm just saying
I just keep my shit a hundred percent, so if you doubt me
You must be getting your statistics from Anthony Fauci
And Bernie sold out, he supported Joe and Hillary-
After they stole the primary from him, you must be kidding me?
Bernie, I used to fuck with you, where's your fucking integrity?
Can't go from standing for something to standing with the enemy
Oh fuck you, Chris
Now that's enough of the blue
Let's get to aiming at the red, someone bring in Ted Cruz
You're just so damn punch-able, borderline fully unlovable
Even your daughter avoids hugging you
Who else? Mike Pence, who's obsessed with his wife
So I consensually had sex with her twice the other night
Told me she ain't had the dick in weeks
So I fucked her on your pile of Bibles, Mike
She really is a religious freak
That is just completely inappropriate
Mitch McConnell, you are the literal definition of not having a face for television
Please, wear a mask, keep that fucking shit hidden
You look like a guy who shouldn't be in the presence of children
Wait, did someone say children?
Easy does it, Bill, you and Hillary chill
Justice is coming for you still
Because one day, the world will see the truth, that's a bet
I just hope I'm here to see it and you ain't murdered me yet
And see, then there's Donald Trump, this motherfucker been on one
A chance to say the right thing, he goes and says the wrong one
When there's a chance to unite us, he instead
Divides us even more with the stupid shit that he says
And I can't stand for it
His environmental policy makes George-fucking-W look like he's Captain Planet
Rolling regulations back, setting back clean air and water
All to put big business on a better track
While the animals suffer, so do we
The rich save a little money while they poison you and me
So geez, is he the lesser or greater of two evils?
Or is he really tryna drain the swamp and help the people?
Ask me, I don't even fucking know anymore
I feel like every politician's just a pawn on the board
Trump and Biden alike, so until I stand corrected
I'll be saying "Fuck every politician that's been elected"
And the truth hurts, but fuck it man, ignorance is worse
Even Google's in on it, I can't trust my own search
They treat us like the sheep, they the wolves in the dark
Playing with our lives, and our minds and our hearts
We been living in the Matrix, losing our direction
Evil algorithms altering all our perceptions
So what the fuck do I know? And what the fuck do you?
Shit, we all just confused tryna find what's true
So I never say I'm right about everything that I said
Not telling you to agree, don't really want people dead
But fuck, this shit been so messed up for so long
And my only way to process it is put it in a song
'Cause all I got's some paper with a pen and mic
And my fucking first amendment right, tell 'em again like
All I got's some paper with a pen and mic
And my fucking first amendment right, raw thoughts
You have two new messages
Hey Chris, it's Joe Biden
Listen man, I uh, I wanted to uh, wait?
Who did I call again? Is anyone there?
Hello? Jill, ah damn it Jill
How do I use this stupid phone?
Next message
Hey Chris, Trump here
Donald Trump, the president
Anyways, I heard your song, terrible stuff, really terrible
I think it's tremendously important that I remind you that I, Donald Trump
Am probably, most likely, but definitely probably
The best President we've ever had in this country
And you're just a loser rapper recording songs in his basement, okay?
Now I will admit, the line about having sex with Pence's wife was actually pretty funny though
Uh sir, what the fuck?
Oh sorry, Mike, I forgot you were standing right next to me
Anyways, God bless America
