Do you really wanna let the rhythm take control?
Let the rhythm take control
Do you, do you wanna get up to the music?
Do you really wanna let the rhythm take control?
Let the rhythm take control
Let the rhythm take control
Okay, all right, it's party time
Pump up the volume, kicking the rhyme
Let my turntables run, now here we go
People in the house, are you ready for show?
Go with the tempo, faster and faster
I cross the fader here with the master
Up with the power, free your soul
Come together, no more control
Five, four, three, two, one
Everybody in the club get up and get down
Raise your hands up in the air
People on the floor sing, "Oh, yeah"
The feeling is up all through this night
Let your body go and do it right
Start humpin', jumpin' all around
Get to the music, get up to my sound

I'm back again with the mic in my hand
And I rap my song and I shake your hands
This stuff is made for you and me
Oh, party people, can it be?
Can it be this beat explodes?
I mix the mix and the turntable smokes
All the ladies get up with this dance hall style
The guys are jumpin', humpin' getting wild
Now open your mind and what you gonna do
'Til the sun comes up and the sky is blue?
This party ain't over, you enjoyed the time
But now it's stoppin' and it's party time
Here we go again, yeah, once again
Pump up the party, pump up the jam
United people here all over the world
