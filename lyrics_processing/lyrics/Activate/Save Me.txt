Don't let us be apart
Oh, save me a place in your heart
In your heart
Save me, save me a place in your heart
Don't let us be apart
Oh, save me a place in your heart
(Place in your heart, place in your heart)
Save me, save me a place in your heart
Don't let us be apart
Oh, save me a place in your heart
In your heart
Save me a place in your heart
It's crazy, don't let us be apart
So far, so good, would you take my love?
All I need is the way to your heart
Your emotions make a soul confused
One is one, don't make me feel so used
In the heat of the night you trapped my soul
Feel the power, don't lose control
Get up into the rhythm, feel all right
You're the one for me, the only one tonight
My heart is pumping blood into my vein
Appearing on the floor, come on once again
The bass keeps running through the place
This stuff is hot, this is my taste
Girl, I like your style, you're so really smart
Give me the key, the way to your heart

On with the program, the heat is on
Time is running, where's a new song?
Feel good at night, step in your life
Fall in love with you through the night
For a lonely heart, you satisfied my soul
Cry for help, lose my self control
Move your body, don't be so pride
I'm so sentimental, I need you by my side!
I say respect my love, feel vibration
Waiting for touch, sweet sensation
Feel the feeling, my heart is pumpin'
Slave to the music, the place is jumpin'
