It's just another dream
I say what I want
I say what I feel
I do anything
I'm gonna make it real
Give me love
In another dream
Dream, back on Earth
Now, hey, I saw you first
Looking for the queen at night
Love is right tonight
Now I know I want you
Could I be, be with you?
Let's make a deal
Oh, make it real
Get crazy, you are made of steel
Deep down, keep on moving
Work your body, don't stop grooving
Babe, don't destroy my dream
We are together in another heavy dream
I say what I want
I say what I feel
I do anything
I'm gonna make it real
Give me love
In another dream (In another dream)

It's gonna be all right
We are flying like birds
Just take it on
Don't make so many words
Dreaming of a true romance
Come on, babe, take a chance
You make me feel, feel this way
Don't leave me, I'm begging you to stay
Right or wrong, I'm dreaming on
Catch my heart, you are so strong
Wake me up or I scream

Your love is in the air
Anytime and anywhere
Never ever play with me
Introduce my fantasy
It's weakness in your eyes
Don't tell me no more lies
Break my heart, break my soul
Cheek to cheek, please fill this hole
Attention, hey, look at me
I'm going down on my knees
Try my love, I'll never stop
Take you up, boom, to the top
It's not a secret, I love you
Hard times I'm going through
Lonely, yeah, that's what I am
Still, I'm hoping that you'll understand
