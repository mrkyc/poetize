I get hypnotized
I get hypnotized

I get hypnotized
Hypnotized
I get hypnotized
I get hypnotized
Hypnotized
I get hypnotized 'cause I looked in your eyes
Things are not the same
I'm in paradise since I looked in your eyes
You are the one to blame
I get hypnotized 'cause I looked in your eyes
Things are not the same
I'm in paradise since I looked in your eyes
You are the one to blame
England in the summertime
With my love, everything was fine
Shoppin', walkin' in the streets
No rain, no fog, enough time, no needs
Then I saw you in a coffee bar
Two steps away, away so far
I really like to get to know you well
A blink of your eyes, no fairytale
A flash like dynamite
Jane asked me something quite all right
You might also likeHey, Tom, what's goin' on?
What's up with you?
Is there something wrong?
She asked me once, she asked me twice
No answer
Then I realised
Head over heels, I was fallin' in love
She's the one I was dreaming of
I get hypnotized 'cause I looked in your eyes
Things are not the same
I'm in paradise since I looked in your eyes
You are the one to blame
I get hypnotized 'cause I looked in your eyes
Things are not the same
I'm in paradise since I looked in your eyes
You are the one to blame
On a Sunday, what a black day
All in vain, no other way
I've gotta tell Jane no way out
We've gotta split, there's no doubt
Can't clear my mind, everything I see
The smile, the face, the eyes, I mean
She's beautiful, a rising sun
A sweet adventure has just begun
I hurry up before she's gone
Gone away, gone away with the sinkin' sub
But wait a minute
Now check your brain
Who's your partner in this game?
What am I without my girl?
She's the one in this whole wide world
C'est la vie like in the movies
I adore you like you adore me
I get hypnotized 'cause I looked in your eyes
Things are not the same
I'm in paradise since I looked in your eyes
You are the one to blame
I get hypnotized 'cause I looked in your eyes
Things are not the same
I'm in paradise since I looked in your eyes
You are the one to blame
I get hypnotized
I get hypnotized
I get hypnotized
I get hypnotized
I get hypnotized
Hypnotized
I get hypnotized
Hypnotized
I get hypnotized
I get hypnotized
