Where'd you go to sleep last night?
You said you'd tell me where you'd go
You stuttered when I asked you dear
I heard your heartbeat in your throat
Did you tell him all our shit my dear?
Does he know about the fight?
'Cause I bet he didn't listen dear
But I'm sure he took your side

I keep on rolling around this town, rolling around this town
But nobody wants to see me, nobody wants to see me
I keep rolling around this town, rolling around this town
But nobody wants to see me, nobody wants to see me
I'm bringing 'em down

I know that you are lying dear
I can taste it on your tongue
I can hear that you were smiling dear
When you said your night was fun
So I called up all your friends today
And they begged me to relax
But I punched the bedroom wall anyway
Baby sign my cast
You might also like
I keep on rolling around this town, rolling around this town
But nobody wants to see me, nobody wants to see me
I keep rolling around this town, rolling around this town
But nobody wants to see me, nobody wants to see me
I'm bringing 'em down

And I waited up all night my dear
And I chased you through the day
And I keep on asking questions dear
But you don't know what to say
And my friends have been out dancing dear
And my parents are a blur
And I'm feeling so much older now
When I think of what we were

I keep on rolling around this town, rolling around this town
But nobody wants to see me, nobody wants to see me
I keep rolling around this town, rolling around this town
But nobody wants to see me, nobody wants to see me
I keep rolling around this town, rolling around this town
But nobody wants to see me, nobody wants to see me
I keep rolling around this town, rolling around this town
But nobody wants to see me, nobody wants to see me

Bringing 'em down (rolling around this town)
Bringing 'em down (rolling around this town)
Bringing 'em down (rolling around this town)
