My hair is curly but I'd like it straight
I don't go on no dates
My mama says I'm better than them anyway
I'm not mad at no one else
I'm disappointed in myself
And I don't care if no one can tell
Cause I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?
I don't like my big nose
Its bigger than anything
From my head to my toes
I don't like my big face
Cause nothing on this earth
Needs that much space
I'm not mad at no one else
I'm disappointed in myself
And I don't care if no one can tell
Cause I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?
I'm not mad at no one else
I'm disappointed in myself
And I don't care if no one can tell
Cause I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?

Well help the insecure
Help me find out if I'm dirty
Or if I'm pure
Cause I'm trying to figure out
Who I'm supposed to be
Do I deserve to go on happily?
I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?
I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?
I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?
I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?
I'm not mad at no one else
I'm not mad at no one else
I'm disappointed in myself
And I don't care if no one can tell
Cause I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?
I'm not mad at no one else
I'm disappointed in myself
And I don't care if no one can tell
Cause I don't wish on wishing wells
Cause they don't work so what the hell?
