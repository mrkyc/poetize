I won't have to hear my friends try to tell me I'm wrong
Till all my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try to tell me I'm wrong
I'm never gonna tell it, oh
I'm never gonna tell it
I'm never gonna say that you're doing me wrong
Or admit that my trust in you has gone
They'll never find out that we're not getting along
I'm never gonna tell it
Oh no
No one's ever going to know it
I'm never gonna show it
Until the day my suspicions are gone
I won't have to hear my friends try to tell me I'm wrong
You'll always think that we are getting along
I'm never gonna tell it
Oh no
No one's ever gonna see that you put me down girl
You've been a run-around girl, a play girl, a hip-hooray girl
But there's gonna be a change in your foolish ways, girl
This dog will have his day, oh boy girl
It'll be my victory
