Ok. We're gonna play some funk so loud
We're gonna rock and roll the crowd
Just watch them dance, watch them dance

We really love to play
We really want to stay here
Won't you take the time
To get the music on your mind
We'll release you from the bind

We've been around for such a while
Be kinda hard not to have a style
When time get slower by the mile
We relax and wear a great big smile
You can count my teeth

One, two, three, four, five
People think cause we are here
Our jazz ran out the ships won't steer
No more. We picked up on the rhythm here
If you just take a toot and have a beer
We're gonna make it clear
Yes, and when the morning gets here
Jazz and soul
