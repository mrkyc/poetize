(what about the woodpecker thing?)
Yeah, they call me the kid
Sexy man
But I know nothing about the great big H
I'd watch that football game while the hornies occupied my day
I never peeped to where she was coming from
When she'd say, "Though you're here, I'm all alone"
Then she made it perfectly clear
With some inspiring words in a song, dig:
{sung:}
If you ain't gonna get it on
Take your dead ass home (now light my fire, baby!)
If you ain't gonna get it on
Take your dead ass home (a-flick-a my Bic, even!)
If you ain't gonna get it on
Take your dead ass home (I'd love to play in your tidy bowl)
Ha, ha whoo-eee!
There once was a man from Peru
Who went to sleep in his canoe (say something nasty)
He was dreaming of Venus
And took out his penis
And woke up with a handfull of goo
Put your foot on the rock!
OK bye!
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, aiii! (x2)

And the prosecutor popped them in the pen

Well, flick-a my Bic, baby!
If you ain't gonna get it on
Take your dead ass home

I'll come if you call
There once was a man from Peru
Who went to sleep in his canoe (say somethin' nasty!)
He was dreaming of Fifi
And took out his peepee
And woke up with a handfull of goo
Put your foot on the rock!
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ohh!
There once was some freaks from L.A. (and what'd they do?)
Who came to New York to play (yeah?)
They was busted by the pussy posse (pussy who?)
