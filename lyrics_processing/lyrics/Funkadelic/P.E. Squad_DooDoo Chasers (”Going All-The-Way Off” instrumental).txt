Our mouths neurological assholes
And psychologically speaking
We're in a state of mental diarrhea
Talking shit a mile a minute
Or in a state of constipated notions
Can't think of nothin' but shit
And in this world of stinky futures
Shitty memories and constipated 19 now nows
Emerges from the hiney of your head
The doo doo chasers
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosisenemasquad
The prune juice of the mind
The doo doo chasers
Friends of roto rooter
Bringing you music to get your shit together
By the band in the tidy bowl of your brain
(What was that long word again Promental?)
A musical bowel movement
Designed to rid you of moral diarrhea
Social bullshit
Crazy do-loops
Mental poots

One swipe a clean wipe
(Go flush it, fellas)
And what causes all of this shit?
What is the source of food for thought?
Ego-munchies
Images doggie bags
Me burger with I sauce on it
Me burger with I sauce on it
A myself sandwich, a personal burger hamburger
And a glass of constricted cola
Out to lunch with lunch meat
The fear of being eaten by the sandwich
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis
The doo doo chasers
Friends of roto rooter
Music to clean your shit by
Low calorie logic
Muscle brain
Skinny brain
Count the calories of your thoughts
Funk, Confucius says
Like Chinese laxatives
Sweet and sour bowel movements
And in this world of stinky memories
Shitty futures, 19 now nows constipated
Like the prune juice of the mind
The band in the tidy bowl of your brain
Bringing you music to clean your shit by
Funk, the P-Preparation
The mental musical bowel movement
Groovalax
One swipe a clean wipe
And with no extra charge
A psychological trend
A neurological enema
Holy shit
(Let me try one crap)
Corpolite
Prehistoric doo doo
Helping you get your shit together
Backstage at a Funkadelic rehearsal
We bring you the doo doo chasers
(Which one is George Clinton?)
Out to lunch with lunch meat, once again
The fear of being eaten by a sandwich
Lunchville
Where lunch is a nice time of day
At least twice a week
Fried Ice Cream is a reality
(Which one is George Clinton?)
Fried Ice cream is a reality
Guess who's coming to lunch
I'm not gonna pay for this lunch, man
Fried Ice Cream is a reality
Fried Ice Cream is a reality
