I hope you know I swear to God
I hope you know that this won't stop
I hope you know I swear to God
I hope you know that this won't stop
I hope you know I swear to God
(Goddamn, just another heartbreak)
I hope you know that this won't stop
(Goddamn, just another heartbreak)
I hope you know I swear to God
(Goddamn, just another heartbreak)
I hope you know that this won't stop

I swear to God, I won't stop until you're shakin'
Trust me baby, you know I want you to
And let me slide into you, please baby
And if you're screamin', then I'm screamin' too
If you want it let me bring it, let me sneak into your house tonight

Breathe in
And I'm coming to these terms
That my heart won't beat anymore
I just can't get it
Sing along sing if you want
Ten more seconds 'til we're through the door
And it's a dance party
Everyone's looking for
Been drinkin' tonight
And I won't stop
When it's a quarter to four daylight is breakin'
You might also like
I swear to God, I won't stop until you're shakin'
Trust me baby, you know I want you to
And let me slide into you, please baby
And if you're screamin', then I'm screamin' too
If you want it let me bring it, let me sneak into your house tonight

I'll call you in the morning if you think it's right
Is it over?
Is it over?
*Camera Shutter*
Now at the dance party
Everyone looked just right
I played you all night
Would you believe me
If I told you that "I love you"
And every day I felt this way?
Would you take me to the place you know
The one that leaves me all alone?
Wait right here just for a minute
We'll talk a little just about it
We'll take it slow
I won't let you go

I swear to God, I won't stop until you're shakin'
Trust me baby, you know I want you to
And let me slide into you, please baby
And if you're screamin', then I'm screamin' too
If you want it let me bring it, let me sneak into your house tonight
I swear to God I won't stop until you're shakin'
And let me slide into you, please baby
I swear to God I won't stop until you're shakin'
And let me slide into you, please baby
(I have like the chorus down pretty good
Like I have all the words)
