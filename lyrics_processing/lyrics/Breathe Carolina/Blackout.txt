Caught up and I can't feel my hands
No need to chase
Can you relate? Can you keep up the pace
Like you're dyin' for this?

And when you say, "I'm not okay
I left my phone in the cab
Now you can't get me"

I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time, I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started

And I can't see your face
Cigarette the wrong way
Inhale to the top of my lungs
I've been dyin' for this
You might also like
And when you say, "I'm not okay
I left my phone in the cab
Now you can't get me"

I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time, I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time, I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started

This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
Goin' and goin' and goin' and goin' and go (Go)

This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
Goin' and goin' and goin' and goin' and go

I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time, I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time, I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder
I'm o-o-on fire
I won't blackout
I'm on my way
I'm only gettin' started

This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so

This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
This won't stop 'til I say so
Goin' and goin' and goin' and goin' and go
