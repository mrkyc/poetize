I've got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I've got a heart that will
Never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special when you spoke my name
I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowin' when something is right
I feel like I must have known you, in another life
I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breath
You asked what's wrong with me
You know my friends say "You're just being crazy"
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart it can't rest 'til then (Woah, woah)
I, I can't wait to see you again

And I got this crazy feelin'
Deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again
You might also like
The last time I freaked out I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breath
You asked what's wrong with me
You know my friends say "You're just being crazy"
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart it can't rest 'til then (Woah, woah)
I, I can't wait to see you again

I've got my sight set on you
And I'm ready to aim
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready

The last time I freaked out I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breath (Oh)
You asked what's wrong with me (Oh)
You know my friends say "You're just being crazy"
The next time we hang out (Oh)
I will redeem myself (Oh)
My heart it can't rest 'til then (Woah, woah)
I, I can't wait to see you again
