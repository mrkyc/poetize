Shoulda checked it at the door, yeah
Barely breathin' on the floor, yeah
Fluorescent lights inside my eyes
I wish it was the first time
I got nothin' on the inside
I'm hangin' on to every light

I can't let you go now
It's about time that we slow down
I never heard silence be so loud
Girl why you got to be so loud?
So just let me know now
If I should just let you go now
I never heard silence be so loud
Girl why you got to be so loud?

I shoulda put it all on the line
You're givin' someone else your time
I shoulda put it all on the line
All on the line
I'm not doin' alright
I'm not doin' alright
I'm not doin' alright
I'm not doin' alright
You might also like
I guess I'm going home now
So you could turn all the lights out
How you're the one less alone

I can't let you go now
It's about time that we slow down
I've never heard silence be so loud
Girl why you got to be so loud?
So just let me know now
If I should just let you go now
I never heard silence be so loud
Girl why you got to be so loud?

I shoulda put it all on the line
You're givin' someone else your time
I shoulda put it all on the line
All on the line
I'm not doin' alright
I'm not doin' alright
I'm not doin' alright
I'm not doin' alright
I shoulda put it all on the line
You're givin' someone else your time
I shoulda put it all on the line
All on the line
I shoulda put it all on the line
You're givin' someone else your time
I shoulda put it all on the line
All on the line
