(Oh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Chasin'
(Ay)
(Ay, yeah)
(Ay, ay)

I'm down on my luck
So I
I'm down for too much
Would you
Come a little closer when we post up
Make the most of this rush (This rush)
Mind's racin', eyes blurry
Your body's shakin', no worries
Are you down on your luck?
Are you down for this much?

I open a bottle of champagne and pass it to ya
You need a man to ease your mind, I'm lovin' on ya
Baby girl you feel alone?
Turn up and let it go

(Ooh, ooh)
Me and my crew
Staying out late, sittin' sideways
But most days you can find us kickin' it low key
(Ooh, ooh)
Me and my crew
Livin' so fast and so hard, chasing hearts
(Sittin' sideways) (Yeah)
(Sittin', sittin' sideways) (Oh, yeah, chasin')
(Sittin' sideways) (Aah)
(Kickin' it low key, most days)

I'm Down on my luck
'Cause I've been leaving too much
There's nowhere that I'd rather be
Than post up makin' slow love with you
My mind's racin', eyes are blurry
Bacardi chasin', no worries
And I don't wanna give it up
But I'm out of touch with you
Being down for so much

I open a bottle, there's no pain and nothin' on ya
You need a man to ease your mind I'm lovin' on ya
Baby girl you feel alone?
Just turn up and let it go

(Ooh, ooh)
Me and my crew
Staying out late, sittin' sideways
But most days you can find us kickin' it low key
(Ooh, ooh)
Me and my crew
Livin' so fast and so hard, chasing hearts
(Sittin' sideways) (Yeah)
(Sittin', sittin' sideways) (Chasing)
(Sittin' sideways) (Aah)
(Kickin' it low key, most days)
Tryin' to find somethin' new
Tryin' to find the love, in you (Oh, oh)
Champagne (Chasin')
No pain (You can)
Trust me (Oh, oh)
(Ooh, ay, yeah)
(Me and my crew)
Just turn up and let go

(Ooh, ooh)
Me and my crew
Staying out late, sittin' sideways
But most days you can find us kickin' it low key
(Yeah)
(Ooh, ooh)
Me and my crew
Livin' so fast and so hard, chasing hearts
(Sittin' sideways) (Chasin' hearts)
(Sittin', sittin' sideways) (Chasin' hearts)
(Sittin' sideways) (Ay)
