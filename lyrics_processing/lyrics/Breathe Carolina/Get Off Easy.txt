Ok, camera's rolling
We are now in the residence
The first level living room area
Wherein victim number one, was found
There is evidence of ransacking in this room
Shut the fuck up!

See the girl with the pretty eyes
Sittin' pretty in her disguise
All alone and I don't know why
Lookin' good like she don't try
Sweet talkin' to paralyze
Wouldn't know she's a dirty dime

Stories changing colors fadin'
You are nothin' more
Than a thought

I've never seen you're eyes so red
Familiar stranger
Slips into my bed
I should have killed you
When I had the chance
I should have killed you when I had the chance
To get off easy
You might also like
Only pretty on the outside
Full of nails on the inside
I guess lust is blind
Red nails and a butchers knife
I don't care 'cause she's lookin' fine
She's a good way to die

I've never seen you're eyes so red
Familiar stranger
Slips into my bed
I should have killed you
When I had the chance
I should have killed you when I had the chance
To get off easy

Next time I won't be so weak
I made it out alive
Next time I won't be so weak
I made it out alive, 'cause I
Next time I won't be so weak
I made it out alive, alive, alive
Next time I won't be so weak
Stories changing colors fadin'
You are nothing more
Than a thought

I've never seen you're eyes so red
Familiar stranger
Slips into my bed
I should have killed you
When I had the chance
I should have killed you when I had the chance
To get off easy

I thought all girls wanted fellas to take them to fancy places and spend lots of money
