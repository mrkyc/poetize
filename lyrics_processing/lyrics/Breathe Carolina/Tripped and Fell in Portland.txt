The secret's out
Our lips are wide as oceans
I sold my eyes for emerald dimes
The edges blur, the walls are bending
You bite like you don't have any teeth to break my skin
(I feel like she's on fire)
And every room is another world I'm walking in
We couldn't get much higher

I tripped and fell so deep I can't come down
How did you run
Into a door that's wide open
Get a hold of yourself
I tripped and fell so deep I can't come down

Our hands are melting maps
Balancing on a fence
The change made no sense
The edges stir
The walls are dancing
You might also likeI steal everything just to give it back again
(Trust me I'm a liar)
And all the words I bought, they aren't worth anything
We couldn't get much higher

I tripped and fell so deep I can't come down
How did you run
Into a door that's wide open
Get a hold of yourself
I tripped and fell so deep I can't come down

Brace yourself
There's no way out
We left our minds behind
Climbing the blinds
Fabricating time, 'til we come back to life

I tripped and fell so deep
I tripped and fell so deep I can't come down
How did you run (Oh yeah)
Into a door that's wide open
Get a hold of yourself (Oh yeah)
I tripped and fell so deep I can't come down
Into a door that's wide open
Get a hold of yourself
I tripped and fell so deep I can't come down
(Alright, cool, are you ready?)
Yeah
Please forgive me
I don't wanna hurt anymore
My heart is broken
Can I take you home (Keep breakin' yours)
Open yourself up to me and surrender
Can I take you home (Please forgive me)
