Your body was the one thing I wanted
You bit your bottom lip
I felt it in my bones
Heart jumps out my chest, I was haunted
I had to shake it off
When can we be alone?

How'd you get me up against the wall?
So high
I never thought that I could take the fall

Now I want it all
All your shadows in the dark, that too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me
Is part of you
Now I want it all
All your shadows in the dark, that too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me
Is part of you
Now I want it all
You might also like
Your name on the tip of my tongue tastes
Like smoke and you fuck so incredible
You slip through the cracks fill the dead space
I had you every way, but I woke up alone

How'd you get me up against the wall?
So high
I never thought that I could take the fall

Now I want it all
All your shadows in the dark, that too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me
Is part of you
Now I want it all
All your shadows in the dark, that too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me
Is part of you
Now I want it all

All of me is wrapped around you
They will never hold you like I do
A thousand suns will stay and melt
Our shadows into one
(Into one)
Now I want it all
All your shadows in the dark, that too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me
Is part of you
Now I want it all
All your shadows in the dark, that too
Run my fingers through your hair
'Til every part of me
Is part of you
Now I want it all
