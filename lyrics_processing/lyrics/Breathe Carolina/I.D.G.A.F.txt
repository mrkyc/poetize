A constant red on for days and days
I see those lights reflected on your face
Everything can change the moment that you blink
But I don't mind (I don't mind)

So if you wanna come in then come in
Disintegrate into me tonight
And if you wanna give in then give in
Anything that you feel is right

Even if this chemistry's catastrophe
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
If you wanna taste
Then take a bite right out of me
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck

Freezing time like a strobe on you
Breathing in electronic fumes
We've made our minds and
We've made our beds, so let's sink in (Let's sink in)
You might also like
So if you wanna come in then come in
Just disappear into me tonight
And if you wanna give in then give in
Anything that you feel is right

Even if this chemistry's catastrophe
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
If you wanna taste
Then take a bite right out of me
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck

If you wanna come in then come in (Oh)
Disappear into me tonight (Oh)
If you wanna give in then give in (Oh)
Give in to me
Give in to me

Even if this chemistry's catastrophe
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
If you wanna taste
Then take a bite right out of me
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
We're not built to last
Shatter like glass, so come, come on
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I can't remember anything
Like what's your name?
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
