No matter what I do, do
No matter what I say-ayy-yay-yay-ayy
I'm frozen here with you, you
Wish I could melt away-ayy-yay-yay-ayy

Am livin' in the life I
Thought that I'll be holdin' on to you, like, I do right now
Am livin' in the life I
Thought that I'll be holdin' on to you, like, I do right now
I know
You got me all in my mind
Spendin' all of my time
Stressin' 'bout you
But we come back every time no matter how hard that we try
Stuck together like glue
Stuck together like glue
Stuck together like glue
Glue, glue
Stuck together like glue, glue

Got nothin' left to prove, prove
Got nothin' in the way-ayy-yay-yay-ayy
Like sunlight in the room, room
You take away the shayy-yay-yay-ed
You might also like
Am livin' in the life I
Thought that I'll be holdin' on to you, like, I do right now
Am livin' in the life I

Spendin' all of my time
Stressin' 'bout you
But we come back every time no matter how hard that we try
Stuck together like glue
Stuck together like glue
Stuck together like glue
Glue, glue
Stuck together like glue, glue

(Ooh)
I just can't let go of you
(Ooh)
I just can't let go of you

You got me all in my mind
Spendin' all of my time
Searchin' 'bout you
But, we come back every time no matter how hard that we try
Stuck together like glue
Stuck together like glue
Stuck together like glue
Glue, glue
Stuck together like glue, glue
Stuck together like glue
Stuck together like glue
Stuck together like glue
Glue, glue
Stuck together like glue, glue
