Sorry
It's all right, it's all right, Jesus

This feels oh so right to me
Taking back all the words I said
Never meant to say "stay with me"
It's all coming back to me
Get back to the world I left
Gettin' rid of everything I don't need
(So now) the pressure's off
Played this game before
So I know all your bullshit tactics (Woo!)

And I swear she would run
But she won't follow me
And I'll tear up this love like it don't mean a thing
For too long it was you, way before it was me
I'm not giving up, I gave up enough
It's back to me

Lies spread
Like your legs did
Take it back, it'll stop this track right here (Uh-uh)
Can't keep my name out your mouth
I know it's getting hard
But isn't that the way you liked it? (Woo!)
The pressure's off
Played this game before
So I know all your bullshit tactics (Woo!)
You might also like
And I swear she would run
But she won't follow me
And I'll tear up this love like it don't mean a thing
For too long it was you, way before it was me
I'm not giving up, I gave up enough
It's back to me

Take it back
When we were golden
Told you we would shine forever, now it's just whatever
Take it back
When we were golden
Now it's just, now it's just melted down and sold
(And I swear she would run, but she won't follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me)
(And I'll tear up this love like it don't mean a thing, mean a thing)
Mean a thing (Woo!)

And I swear she would run
But she won't follow me
And I'll tear up this love like it don't mean a thing
For too long it was you, way before it was me
I'm not giving up, I gave up enough
It's back to me (Back to me, back to me)
It's back to me (Back to me, back to me)
It's back to me (Back to me, back to me)
I'm not giving up, I gave up enough
