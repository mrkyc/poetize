Don't apologize
If you can't look me in my eyes
It kills me, now I don't know you
I don't owe you, take the money and go
Leave my heart broke
You coulda had everything I own
You got so lost, I don't get it
Where you get off leaving me all alone?

You said some things that you can't take back
I know where it's going when you look like that
You can see what you started and you still want more
You sure you want a war?

Shots fired, shots fired, I know
Shots fired, words start flying, we go off
Words start flying, we go off
Shots fired, shots fired, I know
Shots fired, words start flying, we go off
Words start flying, we go off
You might also like
Everyone you loved
In a week I watched you give 'em up
I guess I should have seen it coming
Never thought you'd pull the trigger on me
And days after you left
No one could tell me where you went
You turned your back like a coward
In the end you were never a friend (Never a friend)

If you walk out now then you can't come back
I know where it's going when you look like that
You can see what you started and you still want more
You sure you want a war?

Shots fired, shots fired, I know
Shots fired, words start flying, we go off
Words start flying, we go off (Oh)
Shots fired, shots fired, I know
Shots fired, words start flying, we go off
Words start flying, we go off

And now that everything's undone
Do you tell yourself you've won?
Or hate the way you've become
You're talkin' like a loaded gun
Aiming it at everyone
Just take the money and run
Shots fired, shots fired, I know
Shots fired, words start flying, we go off
Words start flying, we go off (Oh)
Shots fired, shots fired, I know
Shots fired, words start flying, we go off
Words start flying, we go off
