I'm with 20 of my friends
None of us are here
Physically present
But head is nowhere near
It's been
It's been a minute
Like 60 seconds
Since I was in it

These bitches like
"Drinks for backrubs"
(Someone popped a molly)
Feels so good, no
Don't worry 'bout me
Here we go now (Down out the lobby)
Brain in the backseat, J. F. Kennedy

There's nothin' left to say, I'm not gonna change, gonna make mistakes
Find a heart to break, never play it safe, playin' getaway
Sippin' 'til I fade, never hesitate, get carried away
I'm gonna make mistakes, gonna make mistakes, gonna make mistakes
They're ours to make

Hundred dollars later
Whiskey out my ears
(What) What the fuck are you saying?
Let's go where I can hear
That's how, that's how I met
That's how I met her
I met your motha

That bitch was like
"Drinks for backrubs"
Someone popped a molly
Feels so good, no
Don't worry 'bout me
Here we go now (Down out the lobby)
Brain in the backseat, J. F. Kennedy

There's nothin' left to say, I'm not gonna change, gonna make mistakes
Find it hard to break, never play it safe, playing getaway
Sippin' 'til I fade, never hesitate, get carried away
I'm gonna make mistakes, gonna make mistakes, gonna make mistakes
They're ours to make
We're gonna make great mistakes
I heard somebody sayin' "They're ours to make"
We're gonna make great mistakes
I heard somebody sayin' "They're ours to make"
We might not make it home, I heard somebody say
"It's all good, you're not alone"
I heard somebody say
"We're gonna make great mistakes"
I heard somebody sayin' "They're ours to make"
(Woah)

We might not make it home, I heard somebody say
"It's all good, you're not alone", I heard somebody say
"We're gonna make great mistakes"
I heard somebody sayin' "They're ours to make"
