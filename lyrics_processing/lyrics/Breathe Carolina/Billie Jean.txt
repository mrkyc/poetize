She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned
With eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls hearts
And mother always told me
Be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who said I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
You might also like
For forty days and forty nights
I was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Don't think twice, don't think twice
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo
A baby crying, eyes looked like mine (Oh, no)
So we dance on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls hearts
But she came and stood right by me
Smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon
She come into my room
Hey, hey!

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who said I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
A beauty queen, from a movie scene
She caused a scene
Her eyes that dream, of being the one
She said I am the one
The kid's not my son
She said I am the one (Oh, whoa)
