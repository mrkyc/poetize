My eyes open
To the sound
Of a song I've heard
Don't know the name
But I know all the words
Sun came up
Crawled into the front seat
Memories leaving me
Was it all a dream I had?
Time for us to wake up

I'll save my words
To make the most of it
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long

The streetlights passing
Everyone gets me a heartbeat closer
To where it started, beatin'
Keep me feeling safe and sound
When everything that's right is upside down
Was it all a dream I had?
Time for us to wake up
You might also like
I'll save my words
To make the most of it
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
If I have you I'll be home
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long

The world still moves on
I'm sorry I, made you wait
I wish that I, I could stay
The world still moves on
I'm sorry I made you wait
(I live for this)
I wish that I, I could stay
(But I'd die for you)
The world still moves on
I'm sorry I made you wait
(I live for this)
I wish that I, I could stay
(But I'd die for you)
The world still moves on
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
I never meant to be gone so long
If I have you I'll be home
I never meant to be gone so long
Do you still remember my touch at all?
