You asked for it, you paid for it
Get what you deserve
You wanted it, the benefit
How does it feel worse?
You're good as gold, around your neck
Look over your shoulder
Your conscience kills your constant thrills
Shallow make-over

Hide in your eyes
Dancin' in the bright lights
Take out the knife
Oh this flash just doesn't feel right
Hide in your eyes
Mirrors tell the worst lies
Cover it up
Hide in your eyes
Dancin' in the bright lights
Take out the knife
Oh this flash just doesn't feel right
Hide in your eyes
Mirrors tell the worst lies
Cover it, cover it up
You might also like
You asked for it, you paid for it
Get what you deserve (What you deserve)
You've wanted it, the benefit
How does it feel worse?
Split at the end, and lost at the teeth
Foundation is older
And still you're paid from the cuts you've made
Shallow make-over

Hide in your eyes
Dancin' in the bright lights
Take out the knife
Oh this flash just doesn't feel right
Hide in your eyes
Mirrors tell the worst lies
Cover it up
Hide in your eyes
Dancin' in the bright lights
Take out the knife
Oh this flash just doesn't feel right
Hide in your eyes
Mirrors tell the worst lies
Cover it, cover it up

You're good as gold
Your conscience kills
Split at the ends
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

Hide in your eyes
Dancin' in the bright lights
Take out the knife
Oh this flash just doesn't feel right
Hide in your eyes
Mirrors tell the worst lies
Cover it up
Hide in your eyes
Dancin' in the bright lights
Take out the knife
Oh this flash just doesn't feel right
Hide in your eyes
Mirrors tell the worst lies
Cover it, cover it up
