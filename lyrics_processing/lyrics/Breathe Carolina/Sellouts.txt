(Oh!)

I'm pulling hairs tryna cope with this bullshit I'm faced with
How do I face this, a world rendered tasteless
I can't believe what I'm seeing around me
This shit is astounding and you fucks can't seem to get enough
You're fascinated with the old me
And I bet you hate it when we don't scream (Yeah)
You're stuck in the past
And I'm not looking back

I didn't do it just to make you happy
I do it for the ones still clapping
You're stuck on the fence
And I'm over it

I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
Head high giving no fucks
We'll be the ones they hate
I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
Head high givin' no fucks
We'll be the ones they hate
Be the ones they hate
Be the ones they hate
Be the ones the hate
You might also like
It's hard enough to keep it classy
And when you see me bet you don't speak
Tell me you haven't changed
Since the day you learned my name
Some people they just can't be happy
No more questions so don't fuckin' ask me
You're stuck on the fence
And I'm over it

I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
Head high givin' no fucks
We'll be the ones they hate
I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
Heads high givin' no fucks
We'll be the ones they hate

It's easy from the outside
You're fighting to get in
It's not all gold and glory
I gave my life for this
They never fail to judge me
No matter who I am
I can't change my story
But I'll do the best I can
But I'll do the best I can
It's easy from the outside
You're fighting to get in
It's not all gold and glory
I gave my life for this
They never fail to judge me
No matter who I am
I can't change my story
But I'll do the best I can

I see you there with your hands up
I know it's real cause you're just like us
Head high givin' no fucks
We'll be the ones they hate
They never fail to judge me
We'll be the ones they hate
They never fail to judge me
We'll be the ones they hate (Oh)
We'll be the ones they hate (Oh)
We'll be the ones they hate
