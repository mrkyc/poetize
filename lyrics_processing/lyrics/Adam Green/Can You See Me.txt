In a fence where a goat was alone by himself
There was a boy Who was there
A boy who built a snowman out of himself
I've been popping out of closets in robin hood suits
I've been spotted in pictures with Navy recruits
Look at your costume you know that it's true
Any one could pop in as you
Try to untie your lips but they were double knotted
I tried to break into you brain but all the entrances were rotted
If the moon had minute hands it would have meant a lot
But God would have made the moon as a clock
(strum chords)
Look, look, look at me doing this
Look, look, look at me doing that
Look, look, look at the way that I am
Bye bye bye to the crazy ones
Bye bye bye to the crazy ones
Bye bye bye to the crazy ones
You might also likeLook, look, look at me doing this
Look, look, look at me doing that
Look, look, look at me doing that
Look, look, look at the way that I am
(under heavy feedback and distortion)
Look, look, look at me doing this
Look, look, look at me doing that
Look, look, look at the way that I am
(one strum per chord for the rest of the song)
But if everybody was the best
There would be so few of the rest
Oh the places where you've never been
Oh the world was just a baby then
A million ways you learn to cry
When the boys would always pass you by
Oh never to be there again
Oh the children where so old-fashioned then
Coffins decked out on the street
Who's the stranger with the purple feet?
Don't I remember him from somewhere
Before his feet lost his hair?
But if everyone is coffin-bound
Then I'm so scared of being not around
I'm so scared to never make a sound
I'm so scared of being underground
