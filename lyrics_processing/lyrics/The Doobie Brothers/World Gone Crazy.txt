Noon day sun feeling hot and sweaty
Trying to make my pay, trying to make my monthly rent
Working real hard for the US dollar
Living real poor gonna make me holler
I don't wanna live in the street like some folks do
I was raised up on the corner
In front of a grocery store
Shining shoes with the Daily News
For two pence on the floor
Given a chance I'd go back to the days of a simpler time
Cause this old world's gone crazy
And I'm about to lose my mind
Working real hard in the heart of the city
Noon day sun feeling hot and sweaty
Trying to make my pay, trying to make my monthly rent
Working real hard for the US dollar
Living real poor gonna make me holler
I don't wanna live in the street like some folks do
My brother drives delivery right down on Dolphin Street
Has a little house by the railroad track
Kinda small but it was neat
The police came and got him for robbing a liquor store
And even though he didn't do it
They got what they came for

I don't wanna live in the street like some folks do
It's a poor man but life is bitter sweet
Doesn't wanna lose that good thing that he's got
But the same old government that pays you every week
Will come and take your home away and put you in the street
Working real hard in the heart of the city
Noon day sun feeling hot and sweaty
Trying to make my pay, trying to make my monthly rent
