I know you're leaving, leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness, mama, before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while.  (Take me, take me.)
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while

We all must feel heartaches sometime
Right now, right now, I'm feeling mine

I tried my best to be strong, but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child left in a cradle
Before you leave me, leave me far behind
Please let me be happy one more time

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while.  (Take me, take me.)
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while

I'm losing you and my happiness
My life is so dark
I must confess

I'll never ever see your smiling face once more
I'll never ever hear you knock up on my door
Before you leave me, leave me behind
Please let me be happy one more time

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while.  (Take me, take me.)
Oh, with you, baby
Rock me, rock me a little while
Ohhh, yeah, yeah


I'm begging you, baby.  (Take me, take me.)
Oh, baby, I'm pleading.  (Take me, take me, baby.)
Come on, baby.  (Take me, take me.)
Can't you see I'm on my knees now.  (Take me, take me, baby.)
Come on, baby.  (Take me, take me.)
Baby, help me please, yeah.  (Take me, take me, baby.)
Coming for you, baby.  (Take me, take me, yeah.)
Oh, baby, please, please, please, please
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while.  (Take me, take me.)
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while.  (Oh, oh, oh, oh.)
Come on, baby.  (Take me in your arms.)
Rock me, rock me a little while.  (Take me, take me.)
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while.  (Oh, oh, oh, oh.)
Oh, oh, come on, baby.  (Take me in your arms.)
Rock me, rock me a little while.  (Take me, take me.)
