This is my Hall of Fame Induction Speech
You're far too kind
Check

We went from quarter Juices from the corner to wine glasses
We pass blunts thinking 'bout the past as the time passes
I went from roaming hallways with a backpack tryna find classes
To ducking off with girls that snuck backstage tryna find passes
Went from Ripped shoes looking through hand-me-downs trying to find my look
And now it's an overlook the water views thanks to my Rhyme book
Thanks to my flows now you'll be more than good if you pay for my verses
With punchlines you'll be K.O. backwards if you buy my hooks
Okay you might not have got that
That means O.K. as in doing O.K
I mean who would have thought that
That I'd be doing this from back in the old days I couldn't have bought that
But I was sold a dream I ran away with it now look what I brought back
I might have changed is what the niggas that I used to know say
I've brought change is what the niggas that I call my bro's say
That's all I hear, the family's all right here
I swear, that's all I hear, Yeah
For as long as I'm here, we all right here

I think I'm getting wasted tonight
I realized that I made it tonight
You gotta hear just how I made it tonight
Coz it's crazy how I made it
And tonight is the night
I think I've realized that I made it tonight
Raise your glass, let's make a toast and celebrate it tonight
You could be anywhere in the world, you're here with me
I know what it takes to get here, and I'm glad that you could make it tonight
So cheers

I flew afternoon and made it by night
I landed the flight was amazing I just stayed up and write
Chauffeur was waiting with a sign except my name wasn't right
The drive was scenic, the night was dark and the lobby was white
I'm reminded, Forgot to text Mack that I made it I typed that "I made it."
He hit me back like check-in I told him "I appreciate it." Like twice
Scoop me up in the Ghost and headed to the skatepark
Bumping some old Jigga, the same song I think it played like twice
Under the street lights in Miami thinking damn this is life
With no hype, never dropped a song, I'm just saying I'm nice
Trying to prove Santi right, the only one that kept saying I'm nice
And all along he believed in me, all along
I'm out to prove wrong whoever said I would do wrong motherfucker
And Stunna went from Birdman, to Stunna to Uncle Stunna
And Tune went from Lil Wayne, to Tune to my big brother
Man Slim just told me it's my time I gotta call my mother
And tell her...

I think I'm getting wasted tonight
I realized that I made it tonight
You gotta hear just how I made it tonight
Coz it's crazy how I made it
And tonight is the night
I think I've realized that I made it tonight
Raise your glass, let's make a toast and celebrate it tonight
You could be anywhere in the world, you're here with me
I know what it takes to get here, and I'm glad that you could make it tonight
So cheers
Yeah, that's some real shit
But I don't think I'm done yet

I've waited, days after days, I've grown, age after age
I've ripped page after page, now I'm running, stage after stage
With a story, coming from nothing to dinner in a house with mad stories
Now every night's trill we leave the club with mad stories
Now bad bitches love me and good girls go bad for me
I'm having a good night, drinking everything that's bad for me
I'm on all of that, all because I can sorta rap
I mean kinda sorta I'm all that
I want it all so order that
And let's toast

I think I'm getting wasted tonight
I realized that I made it tonight
You gotta hear just how I made it tonight
Coz it's crazy how I made it
And tonight is the night
I think I've realized that I made it tonight
So Raise your glass, let's make a toast and celebrate it tonight
You could be anywhere in the world, you're here with me
I know what it takes to get here, so I'm glad that you could make it
Hold up bring it back
I think I'm getting wasted tonight
I said I've realized that I've made it tonight
Yeah, you gotta hear just how I made it tonight
Coz it's crazy how I made it
And tonight is the night

And I'm glad that you could make it tonight
