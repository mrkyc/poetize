What would you do with the kiss you left on their mouth?
I'd kiss them again so they'd never ever ever run out

(What would you say if I said I really needed you?)

What would you do with the strength of a thousand men?
I'd pick up a thousand cool people and I'd spread them around

I really know this about myself
(What would you say if I said I really needed you?)

I guess I would know a little more than I did yesterday
