Gotta face up to it
Gotta wake up to it
I feel so guilty
Killing time is a sin
There's no way you can win
A dam burst of dreams flows thru' me
They show me where I could be
Flash point feelings flow
Thru' my mind
When my friends tell me
You just can't connect
You ain't got no respect
They tell me nothing
'Cos I know about that
Yes I know about that
I'm not gonna take what people say
Don't feel that I belong today
Sense of freedom and
Sense of pride
From the mountains to the sea
I'll run across this land
Looking out for strength and beauty
A diamond in the sand
And I will chase the four winds over
Trying to understand
And I won't stop until I'm holding
Heaven in my hands

Turn me off the track
Now there's no turning back
Won't let no worries
Turn my head inside out
Now there's no room for doubt
I'm heading for my destiny
And it feels electric to me
Flash point feelings flow
Thru' my mind
I was lonely going nowhere
Drowning on dry land
I was almost stranded there a
Shipwreck on the sand
But now I'll chase the whole world over
Making my demands
And I won't stop until I'm holding
Heaven in my hands
From the mountains to the sea
I'll run across this land
Looking out for strength and beauty
A diamond in the sand
And I will chase the four winds over
Trying to understand
And I won't stop until I'm holding
Heaven in my hands
I was lonely going nowhere
Drowning on dry land
I was almost stranded there a
Shipwreck on the sand
But now I'll chase the whole world over
