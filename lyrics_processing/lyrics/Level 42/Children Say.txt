What I might share with others
But they don't seem to understand
I open my mouth
To rediscover
That I don't have the words at my command
Holding out
For a world so much better
But I'm a stranger in a stranger's land
All my friends have sold out
Couldn't handle the pressure
Counting their blessings trying to salvage what they can
Children say - children say
We open our minds as one
But one more day - slips away
Why don't the dreams of the young never come to be
When I overhear
My parents conversations
Well I'm struck by the things they say
It seems they traded the years
For mere complications
Who ever thought it could end this way
They close the door
But they can't lock it
'cause something of their childhood remains
And they've felt it before
When the man in their pocket
Counted the cost of their material gains

Be strong for the friends you've known
But one fine day - (not) far away
Will we remember the love we used to own
Children say - children say
We open our minds as one
As one more day slips away
Why don't the dreams of the young never come to be
Well you knew what I was saying
But did you know what it meant
When you saw that look in my eye
Did you know it was heaven sent
Was it all a waking dream
All that time we must have spent
Well I guess it must have been
Somehow that feeling came and went
Children say - come what may
Be strong for the friends you've known
But one fine day - (not) far away
Will we remember the love we used to own
Children say - children say
We open our minds as one
As one more day - slips away
Why don't the dreams of the young never come to be
Children say - children say
We thought it would never go
As one more day - slips away
