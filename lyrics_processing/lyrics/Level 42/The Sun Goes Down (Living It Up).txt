Though I live on the edge, time is on my side
All the doors to my life are open wide
Just as long as the wheels keep on turning 'round
I will live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) Is it a crazy notion?
(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) I got forward motion

I don't wanna go to war
I don't wanna go to war
I said, I know what I want
And I don't wanna go to war
Do you follow me?
I saw a soldier standing in a bar
Looked so tired, he'd come so far
He said, "I need to love someone
Before they drop the atom bomb"

There's a girl at the back making eyes at me
And her hair, long and black, is a sight to see
But I get kind of scared when love's around
I just live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) Is it a false emotion?
(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) I got forward motion

So I'm a-taking you out, but I'm a-faking
I'm married to the beat, to the music I gave
The heart I could have given you
Still there's something 'bout the way that you move
And the way the people stare, it's the shock of the new
I want my friends to see me standing next to you

(The sun goes down)

Time is on my side
I don't care what they say, I'll enjoy the ride
But I get kind of scared when I turn around
So I'll stay with the groove 'til the sun goes down

(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) I got forward motion
Ooh, watch her dance
There must be one like her in every club in every town
But I don't mind, that's the way she wants to be
There something 'bout her that reminds me of me
She's my soulmate, we'll be together 'til the sun goes down

(The sun goes down)

(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) Is it a false emotion?
(Living it up, living it up) I can feel it
(Living it up) I got forward motion

(Living it up, living it up)
(The sun goes down)
(Living it up, living it up)
