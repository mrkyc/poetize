Hey, yeah yeah yeah

I just learned that time will come to an end
In twenty thousand million years
I just heard the big bang
With my own ears

People sit and they worry about the future
Live your life 'cos the now is all there is

Forever now
As the world goes round and round
One eternal moment in time
To live forever
Live forever now
Yeah, yeah

If I lived one hundred years in this life
It still don't give me too much time
And time is still the one thing
That money can't buy
