Okay is the rula
Night man cooka
Keep me a rooka
Pop me a pupa
The Heat is where I grew up
So It's what I threw up
Sicker than a mothafucka
Might throw my food up
Hoop coola no one losers
You had good brains
I ain't even had to school her
Meet me at 2'tha
I just want to do her
Pass it to the inc
And let my bro screw her
I'm killin and I'll be that way
I got a large appetite for some pussy and weed
I said my money is green
And my thun thun is blue
And If I pop that bitch
She gon pop one too
Okay she poppin' too
Now she's getting like me
I said we're jerkin
And we stumpin
But can't catch the beat
We can't catch the beat
But I'm feelin' my dance
I had one pill left
And it fell on my hand, Dang...
