I tell her don't drop that
I tell her don't drop that
Let me tell you up with this one there
I tell her don't drop that
Okay, she shaking and moving, earthquaking and grooving
Her booty's so big, it's like watching a movie
These niggers ain't in the mood so just watch what we're doing
We can get a fucking bottle 'cause we do what we're doing
Niggers ain't in the squat, probably 'cause this little bitch got my face on her wall
Little motherfucker rocking, knows to take it abroad
She putting her ass on the show, she ain't taking the jog
I'm mr murder, you be, competition ain't much, so I don't know the defeat
The pretty got martians nigga trying to put me to sleep
I wake up and fuck your bitch, now she going to sleep
Yes, she do that back, she had a nigga on stack, I told her run that back
Beat it up, beat it up all from that back, now you niggers all mad 'cause she ain't coming back
I tell her don't drop that
I tell her don't drop that
I tell her don't drop that
I tell her don't drop that
You know the b a, you know me, huh?
I don't fuck with no hoes, 'cause I don't need that
Feed a bad ass bitch in Ikea, I pull up on a turn, run it like a Visa
Beta, y'all know what it do, imma fuck you until they got you
We kick it, kick it like kung-fu, imma eat it, eat it like a girl food
You can drop that thing, seat full, imma take that pussy, repull
Me and you go by, disco, let me see your thong, sisco
Okay, it is better than nothing, and they don't say part of, they gonna turn up the fortune
Had a big booty, fat was a cutie, she drop that bass on a dime like you see
I tell her don't drop that
I tell her don't drop that
I tell her don't drop that
