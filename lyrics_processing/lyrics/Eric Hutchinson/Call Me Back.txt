Now I find myself consumed with all the lovely things we said
Could you really been as busy as you had claimed
Or have you been soundin' out my last name?
So I will keep hoping and holding out patience for you
Did you get my message? I'm quite sure you never called back
Perhaps I'm just paranoid, I need to cut her some slack
Seems like everyone's better at playin' it cool
And I've always been bad at obeyin' these rules
But as far as ladies go you come and go as you please
Do I really wanna know if I even have a choice?
I've been plastered to the phone and I just wait on your voice
Call me back, call me back, call me back
Even if it's just, even if it's just to say goodbye
I've been obsessing in ways that I usually do
And mostly I got obsessed with whether you got obsessed too
Did I simply imagine the chemistry there?
Was it bad conversation I wasn't aware?
But I will keep hoping and holding out patience for you
Do I really wanna know if I even have a chance?
I've been plastered to the phone and I still wait on your romance
Call me back, call me back, call me back
Even if it's just, even if it's just to say goodbye

But that seems like so long to be alone
I've been wondering what I'd say
But you won't even take time
To sit down and pick up the phone
Call me back, I want you to call me back, call me back
Even if it's just, even if it's just to say goodbye
Call me back, call me back, I want you to call me back
Even if it's just, even if its just to say goodbye
Call me back, I want you to call me back
I gotta, gotta, gotta call me back
