Right about the time I missed your call
I lost my mind the drugs wore off
It's raining where I am
I hope you see the text I sent and don't go soft

Cause I can't stand to be alone
When the buzz starts wearing off

Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more
From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more from you

That's me sitting in the bathroom with the lights off
Nobody knows the kind of stuff I gotta to fight off
I wash away my sins but I can't get the white off
What made you think that you could ever take the night off

I can't stand to be alone
When the buzz starts wearing off
You might also like
Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more
From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more from you

And I don't know who else to call
You're leaving me between the walls
You fake me out, you say you care
You break me down, I go nowhere
And I don't know who else to call
You're leaving me between the walls
You fake me out, you say you care
You break me down, I go nowhere
Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more from you
Can I get a little bit, a little bit
I said can I get a little little little bit more from you (oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah)
Can I get a little bit, a little bit
I said can I get a little little little bit more from you (oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah)

Can I get a little more
Can I get a little more
From you-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
From you-oo-oo-oo-oh-whoa
Can I get a little more
