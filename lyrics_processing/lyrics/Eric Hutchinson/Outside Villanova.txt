If I feel dirty at all
Cause it gets hard to tell
It's never just black and white
She's got a mind of her own and she uses it well
So she invites me over outside Villanova
She's got some pull-out sofa that we won't hardly need
She is only drinking soda, revving up that motor
Got places we could go to, but I still won't believe
That she's only gifted
When I'm standing by her side
She goes unassisted
And I start to relax as I cut her some slack
CHORUS
So get up, I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows
What I've done and what I'm gonna do again
And in the middle of the night
I have a breakdown of sorts with regret creeping in
She's gonna put up a fight
And she will get her way, cause she loves sleeping in
So I need someone to side with when she begins confiding
And I cannot provide it cause I'm endlessly cold
She says she's so excited to play some groom and bride
With me but I'm undecided so I need to be told
You might also likeThat she's only sinking
When I'm sleeping by her side
With a change of thinking
I could pull us away even just for a day
CHORUS
So get up, I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows
What I've done and what I'm gonna do again
She grows impatient to change my tune
She's getting older and legal soon
And I wasn't ready to start out and go upsetting
Some girl that I'd be forgetting
By the time the cops came by that afternoon
And I try to decide as she pulls me aside
CHORUS
So get up, I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows
