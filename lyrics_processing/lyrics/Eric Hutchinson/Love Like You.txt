And there you are
Out in the distance
Sun and the stars
And I feel the way it's gonna be
Reach out and let your heart go free
This is you and me
I've been waiting for a love like you
I've been waiting for a love like you
I've been waiting for a love like you tonight
Broke
I was a little bit broke
Was a little bit broke was a little bit broke
I was broken and you came my way
There's nothing you can ever say
I'm in it to stay
I've been waiting for a love like you
I've been waiting for a love like you
So let me catch fire and blow off stem
This is a crash landing we're living the dream
And let me ask a question
Wheels to the sky
Standing at a crossroads
Look into my eyes
And anybody out there can plainly see
You're never going to know what you do to me
Yes you do and I say it and I say it
You might also likeI've been waiting for a love like you
I've been waiting for a love like you
I've been waiting for a love like you tonight
So let me catch fire and blow off stem
This a crash landing we're living the dream
And we can freak out if you know what I mean
We can go where we go with a love supreme
I said ooh baby it's Russian roulette
I said now ooh baby I'll never forget
What you did for me now how you making me feel
And I've been waiting for a love that is finally real
I said now I've been waiting for a love I've been waiting for a love like you
I've been waiting for love like you love like you tonight
I've been waiting for a love like you
I've been waiting for a love like you
