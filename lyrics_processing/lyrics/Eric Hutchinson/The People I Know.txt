And after all of these years I've got to read his mind
And when he leaves the room I can feel him sigh
As his thoughts they slip out like whispers
Who would've know it'd be this hard to wait
For one person to person to communicate
And it never feels dramatic but we complicate
Thank god for old friends they always forgive us
I'm longing for the days when I am not so tense
When friends are only that and everything makes sense
If I am not myself
Then who am I pretending to be
And I said how am I gonna get by
Without the help of the people I know
For better or worse we all come together
And they won't let me die alone
I said they won't let me die alone
And I've got a sister who I barely see
Despite the fact the lives right up the block from me
And when we run into each other on the street
It's like two strangers soul to soul
You might also likeWhen I was younger she was younger too
It seems the space is the only thing that really grew
And now we're both grown up and still without a clue
Thank god for family they always forgive us
I'm thinking of the house where we were always raised
In every family tree some history remains
If I am not myself
Then who am I pretending to be
And I said how am I gonna get by
Without the help of the people I know
For better or worse we all come together
And they won't let me die alone
I said they won't let me die alone
Maybe I'm not supposed to be close
To all of the people I need the most, need the most
And I said how am I gonna get by
Without the help of the people I know
For better or worse we all come together
And they won't let me die alone
I said now how am I gonna get by
When I'm afraid of the people I know
For better or worse we all come together
And they won't let me die alone
I said they won't let me die alone
I said they won't let me die alone
