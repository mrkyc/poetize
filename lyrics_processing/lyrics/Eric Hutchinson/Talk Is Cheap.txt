And I should know
I've given my everything
And it wasn't close
People mean well
But still make a mess
From now on I'm listening
And saving my breath
Lately I'm losing my appetite
For all the pretty young girls and the socialites
Who just talk
And this is what we do, we just talk
Watch 'em waste breath on a magazine
Or rehash what the television shows all mean
It's just talk
And this is what we do, we just talk
Some people don't know how they really feel
Some people won't talk about what is real
And I could never chitchat all day long
Some people just look for an open ear
Some people don't care what you want to hear
And everybody's talking while they're stringing me along
You might also likeCHORUS
I'll go by what you do
'Cause talk is cheap
And I don't want to wait for you
'Cause talk is cheap
I don't know how you spend your time
But I'm done wasting all of mine
'Cause talk is cheap
Lately I'm tired of politics
And listening to the never-ending arguments
That just stall
And this is what we do, we just talk
Never known someone to change their mind
After a heated debate over the moral lines
We just crossed
But this is what we do, we just talk
Some people get cute and they draw the line
Some people won't choose over left and right
And I could never stomach all that greed
Some people don't care enough
Some people get scared enough
To get talked into something that they think they should believe
I'll go by what you do
'Cause talk is cheap
And I don't want to wait for you
'Cause talk is cheap
I don't know how you spend your time
But I'm done wasting all of mine
'Cause talk is cheap
Some people, some people, some people
Think action is overdue
Some people, some people, some people
Can't wait, we've got work to do
I'll only speak of what I've done
'Cause talk is cheap
And if you're listening, everyone
Bite your tongue when you're talking to me
I'll go by what to do
'Cause talk is cheap
And I don't want to wait for you
'Cause talk is cheap
I don't know how you spend your time
But I'm done wasting all of mine
