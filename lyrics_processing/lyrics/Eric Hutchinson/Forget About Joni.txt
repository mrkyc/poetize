Got to know where you stand
If you are going to try to make a move
She is standing alone with her girls and I don't think she minds
You better not give a damn
If you are going to be one of those dudes
I've seen a thousand come round and she justs shoot them all down the cold shoulder
So if you want my advice don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed
You could give her your heart she wants your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni
Her black hair shines in the night
A fixture smile and she loves to tease
All the atheates and actors have called but she's never responded
She's got those jeans on so tight
She's half egyptian and half japanese
Each time she batting an eye congressmen senators cry
Oh mama help me
So if you want my advise don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed
You can give her your heart she wants your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni
Jajajajaja Joni
Jajajajaja Joni
Jajajajaja Joni
All the men want Joni so much
But she don't want the touch of a man
Your gonna know where you were
The very moment that you caught these blues
And you will lie awake all through your nights wondering what she's doing
Just look at me if your unsure
I've walked a thousand miles in your shoes
I've spent the rest of my life back at this bar everynight trying to love her
So if you want my advice
Don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed
You can forgive her your heart she wasn't your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni
So if you want my advice
Don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who want a girl in her bed
You can give her your heart she wants your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni
Better forget about Joni
Better forget about Joni
