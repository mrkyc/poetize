If you are going to try to make a move
She is standing alone with her girls
And I don't think she minds
You better not give a damn
If you are going to be one of those dudes
I've seen a thousand come round
And she just shoots them all down
The cold shoulder
CHORUS
So if you want my advice don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of a girl who wants a girl in her bed
You could give her your heart she wants your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni
Her black hair shines in the night
Infectious smile and she loves to tease
All the athetes and actors have called
But she's never responded
She's got those jeans on so tight
She's half-Egyptian and half-Japanese
Each time she batting an eye
Congressmen senators cry
Oh mama help me

She's the kind of a girl who wants a girl in her bed
You could give her your heart she wants your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni
Joni
Joni
All the men want Joni so much
But she don't want the touch of a man
You're gonna know where you were
The very moment that you caught these blues
And you will lie awake all through your nights Wondering what she's doing
Just look at me if your unsure
I've walked a thousand miles in your shoes
I've spent the rest of my life back at this bar every night trying to love her
So if you want my advice
Don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed
You can forgive her your heart she wasn't your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni
So if you want my advice
Don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of a girl who want a girl in her bed
You can give her your heart she wants your sister's instead
Better forget about Joni
Better forget about Joni
Better forget about Joni
