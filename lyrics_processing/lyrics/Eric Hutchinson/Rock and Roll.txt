Figuring which club to sneak in
Fancy drinks and fifty-dollar cover charge
Lately it's been a big hassle
Heineken and New Castle
To make sure he's fitting in and living large
Disregard the lies that he will tell
And what he's probably like 'cause
It's not hard his charm is gonna
Get him through the night
If he wants to rock he rocks
If he wants to roll he rolls
He can roll with the punches
Long as he feels like he's in control
If he wants to stay he stays
If he wants to go he goes
He doesn't care how he gets there
Long as he gets somewhere he knows oh no
Ah na na na na na na na na na na na
Ah na na na na na na na na na na na
See her heavy make up and cut t-shirt
Every girl out wants to be her
But they look the same already why adjust
Reading the magazine secrets
Forgetting the topical regrets
'Cause If she comes home all alone the night's a bust
It's a must the swivel in her hips
And the look she gives
It's all her trust if only in the morning
She knew where she lived
You might also like'Cause if she wants to rock she rocks
If she wants to roll she rolls
She can roll with the punches
Long as she feels like she's in control
If she wants to stay she stays
If she wants go she goes
She doesn't care how she gets there
Long as she gets somewhere she knows oh no
Ah na na na na na na na na na na na
Ah na na na na na na na na na na na
And in a wink they're on the brink
From drink to drink and at the bar with cash to blow
Shot to shot it's getting hot
Advance the plot to see how far it's gonna go
All depends so ditch the friends and grab a cab
Another chance at cheap romance
Doesn't count 'cause the room is spinning
Nothing to lose tonight they both are winning
And they fall in love as they fall in bed
They sing
If they wanna rock they rock
If they wanna roll they roll
They can roll with the punches
Long as they feel like they're in control
If they wanna stay they stay
If they wanna go they go
They don't care how they get there
Long as they get somewhere they know oh no
