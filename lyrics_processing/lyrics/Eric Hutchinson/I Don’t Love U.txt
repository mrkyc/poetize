Or say you left me with a permanent vibration
Exotic living and you're pushing your luck
Spending all my money, honey, now you're stuck
So go where you go, go where you go
I don't really care man, I don't want to know
Cheer up, because this isn't the end
But I don't ever want to see you again
Wake up, wake up, I don't love you
Wake up, wake up, I don't love you
Wake up, wake up, I don't love you
I don't love you, I don't love you
I don't love you anymore
You made your bed and tried to crawl out of it after
You turned this thing into a natural disaster
Pack up your ego, give it a rest
I got the pick of any litter, you thought you were the best?
So go tell your friends, go tell your friends
Whether they believe you, it really depends
I hope you can be kind to yourself
It's time to fall in love with someone else
