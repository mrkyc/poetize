A proud attempt to take his destiny
The hands of men, trying to seize the reigns of history
By making plans to reach, the sun
And so by orders of the nations king, they began
Soon they towered over everything, from the ground it seemed
That it could be done

And they said rock by rock, we built a tower that will have no top
We'll get it right beneath the sun, and then keep going just for fun
And they said block by block, straight up to heaven and we can't be stopped
The sun has never felt this good, I'd even kiss it if I could
From the tower of Hollywood

Look
Music, we used to listen to it, now we lookin' at it
Liposuctionin' it, second guessing, questionin' it
Faceliftin' suplementin' strechin' bendin' it till its broken
Takes the wrinkles from the soul, botoxing loose the tone, now it's flat
The gifted was once giving to his children, now it's crap
They have no way to navigate the system, so they crash
They can form, then get torn, by the storm
By the lies of the leprechauns, for the gold you will get stepped on
And they close they eyes in their minds they thinking maybe, just maybe
I can be that one at the top, but why is he one at the top?

And why is the man that ain't never sing a note in his life telling him how to back his tracks
Hackeysack, kicked around, dribbeling ya drop down on the ground
Meanwhile everyone thinks it's all gravy, praying daily, they get trade met:
Red carpet, blue carpet, old carpet, new carpet
New carpet, album drop, didn't sale, used carpet
Don't take off your shoes carpet, she's stained and abused carpet
Everybody rolled up, career fold up, you old news carpet
That's entertainment, live and die inside the public eye
It always was and will forever be a pretty lie

So (long) we all (long) catch on fire (long)
So (long) we all (long) catch on fire (long)
From the Tower of Hollywood

If you want it I'll built it up and just let it go
Blood, sweat, tears, love and rock and roll
Mix it all together, light it up and watch it blow
Blood, sweat, tears, love and rock and roll
If you want it I'll built it up and just let it go
Blood, sweat, tears, love and rock and roll
Mix it all together, light it up and watch it blow
Watch it burn, yeah, watch it burn
So (long) we all (long) catch on fire (long)
So (long) we all (long) catch on fire (long)
And they close (they) eyes in their minds they thinking maybe, just maybe
I can be that one at the top, but why is he one at the top?
And why is the man that ain't never wrote a lyric in his life telling me how to rap
And why is the man that ain't never sing a note in his life telling him how to back his tracks?
So (long) we all (long) catch on fire (long)
So (long) we all (long) catch on fire (long)
From the tower of Hollywood
So (long) we all (long) catch on fire (long)
So (long) we all (long) catch on fire (long)
