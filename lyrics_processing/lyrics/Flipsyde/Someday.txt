Come on
Sha-na-na-na-na (Sha-na-na-na-na)

Someday we're gonna rise up on that wind, you know
Someday we're gonna dance with those lions
Someday we're gonna break free from these chains
And keep on flyin', yeah

They tellin' me, "It's all good, just wait"
You know you're gonna be there someday
Sippin' on Jim Beam, okay
Gotta get these things one day
And 'til then do another line, you know
Searchin' for that other high
Starve or I gotta steal, then steal
Kill or I'm gonna be killed
I got a sack in my pocket
Conscience yellin', "Drop it!"
You know we're gonna lose it someday
And we tryin' to hold it all together
But the devil is too clever so
I'm gonna die, you gonna die, we gonna die
Someday, one day I said
You might also like
Someday we're gonna rise up on that wind, you know
Someday we're gonna dance with those lions
Someday we're gonna break free from these chains
And keep on flyin', come on

Try to lie but it ain't me
Ain't me try to look but I can't see
Can't stop right now 'cause I'm too far
And I can't keep goin' 'cause it's too hard
In the day, in the night, the same thing
On the field, on the block, the same game
On the real if you stop, then it's no pain
But you can't feel pain, then it's no gain
Rearrange and you change and it's all bad
And you try to maintain but you fall back
And you crawl and you slip and you slide down
Wanna make it to the top? Better start now
So I hold my soul and I die hard
All alone in the night in the graveyard
Someday, one day I'ma be free
And they won't try to kill me for bein' me
Hey, someday

Someday we're gonna rise up on that wind, you know
Someday we're gonna dance with those lions
Someday we're gonna break free from these chains
And then keep on flyin', yeah
Fly so low, but so higher
Yeah
If you know how this is
Gonna see it's not that easy
Don't stop, get it 'til it's done
From where you are or have begun
I said, keep on tryin' a little harder
Gonna see everything you need to be
Believe in your dreams
That you see when you're asleep

Someday we're gonna rise up on that wind, you know
Someday we're gonna dance with those lions
Someday we're gonna break free from these chains
And then keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on flyin', yeah
