All the peace talks are over
We coming in taking it over
To get our power
(feel this)
Everything is off the table
We ready and we're willing and able
Ever since we fell out of heaven, man, we been at each other
Stabbin' each other to blasting each other
We done lost the real love now we mad at each other
We keep on dropping them bombs, we won't have any brothers
Your definition of peace is give me all that I need
If you continue to struggle then you will no longer breathe
We blind to the evil like we can no longer see
Rewind it and you will find us repeating our history
Depriving us, victimizing us, your steady driving us to the edge
Put a bullet in your head
Inside of us, somethings igniting us, we must confide in us
Trust and you'll be lead to the knowledge of the dead
Runnin through the system, spotting them secret passages
Coldblooded killer that shot this boy i done asked him
Nightvision, the right vision to see through bullshit
New millennium preaching the roof is my bull pit
Power
All the peace talks are over
We coming in taking it over
To get our power
(feel this)
Everything is off the table
We ready and we're willing and able
Out of the ashes the phoenix is rising, outta the darkness yea it keeps climbin
Every man that is a man should guard his own community
This is nothing new to me, truth is spoken brutally
I believe in God so theres nothing you can do to me
Kick thier bare ass, bare facts like nudity
Do I got to hang you from a clock to see what time it is
When we gonna get tired of this, when we gonna just ride for this
All the children getting killed, all the grownups talking shit
Everybody in between chewin on the devil dick
Traded in them molitovs now they lightn' candle wicks
Called they self revolutionary where is the evidence
Revolutionary's died they was from another time
And they gonna come back again but you ain't gonna be alive
Only thing that we can do is everything so DO IT
Get up off your ass cock back and pursue it
Imma hold it down here plant it on the ground here
Anybody threatening and they body gonna get found here
