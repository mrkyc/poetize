It's time to rise and get further
We in this place and time
When foold just ride and get murdered
Tryin' to get that piece of pie
But I need that whole damn thing
Get this money and this power
Change the whole damn game
My boy be lookin' at me
Like Daddy where are you goin'?
I'm tryin' to get the heater on
Outside it's rainin' and snowin'
They don't teach you this in school
But see this world is a fool
Of you ain't rich you just a slave
And you'll be used as a tool
The other side of money
That's where we destined to be
If you ain't got it you ain't free
When in this land of the beast
I keep on workin' like a surgeon
Always on an excursion state of survival
Gimmie everything I deserve
In this state of survival
That's the reason why I'm always on the go
In this state of survival
That's the land so we can live life comfortable
Hey now don't you cry
I'm a be back so baby dry your eyes
I said
Hey now don't you cry
I'm a be back so baby dry your eyes
I said (I said)
Simple (I said)
And we can just live life
Simple
We can be up on the hill livin'
Simple
And baby we can just live life
Simple
Yeah oh yeah
Yes it goes it goes on by
Just another day
It's been fallin' in and out
Just along the way
Been looking and speaking to all your friends girl
And I'm loosing my mind in this dream world (in this dream world)
Yes I know I gotta make this money grow
If I gotta be in the jungle like an animal
I don't want you hurtin' for nothin' girl
You're my everything I mean it
Baby that's for certain girl
And I won't change
Ever since you've known me I've been the same
The last thing I want is you to feel pain
And if you suffer I'll be the one to blame
That's why I'm
In this state of survival
That's the reason why I'm always on the go
In this state of survival
That's the land so we can live life comfortable
Hey now don't you cry
I'm a be back so baby dry your eyes
I said
Hey now don't you cry
I'm a be back so baby dry your eyes
I said (I said)
Simple (I said)
And we can just live life
Simple
We can be up on the hill livin'
Simple
And baby we can just live life
Simple
Yeah oh yeah
I don't want to have that life
That the girls all lust over
They want to be trophy wives
But that's just not how I roll
There's so much I want to do
If I'm wanting something new
I can buy it for myself
And I
I wanna live life simple
Live life cool
Live in the suburbs my kids can go to school
Live like some rich folks
Feel brand new
And if you want it you can get a dream come true
I wanna live life simple
Live life cool
Live in the suburbs my kids can go to school
Live like some rich folks
Feel brand new
And if you want it you can get a dream come true
In this state of survival
That's the reason why I'm always on the go
In this state of survival
That's the land so we can live life comfortable
