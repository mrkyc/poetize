From the womb to the world from the world to the grave
From the grave to the heavens and my spirit
From the liquor to the drugs to the police and the thugs
To my prayers and hope that he hears it
Little kids in the street never sleep never eat
Carry burdens of their mommas and the papas
To the hell on this Earth gettin hot gettin worse
Cause we're cursed nobody can stop us
Take a look see the sights that I've seen
See the lust see the greed jealousy and killin
Walk the walk that I've walked all alone in the dark
Overtaken by this feelin that I'm feelin
Touch the hand that I've touched in the night what a rush
Turning blue so cold and breathless
See the bars and the chains on your wrist on your brain
Feel the pain of a grown man's death wish
 (Steve Knight)
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more

That's right little mama just keep on walkin' to school
Don't stop and talk to them fools
Tryin' to holla while they sippin' on brew
Cause you're gonna lose
Got to stay focused keep your mind on your dreams
Don't get hypnotized by the bling
Deep inside you must believe and you'll succeed
Cause all we're given is a chance
They play the music and we dance
And ain't no way to make it last if we don't stop and listen
It could be over in a flash
When you killin' for that cash
Flip an Apache and blast 'em with Tomahawk missiles
Moqtada al Sadr Bin Laden Al Qaeda
They all multiplyin' and hidin' and George can't find 'em
And even if he did and killed them then another would come
We makin' enemies faster than we could pick up a gun

From my soul to my heart
From the ending to the start
In between it's an art and I live it
From one person to the next all respect no regrets
If you next you got it then give it
Share a hug share the love we can rise up above
If we try we can fly up to the heavens
All my brothers and my sisters we can make it
If we listen to each other and just keep on

Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
And I can see this change comin'
And I can see this change comin'
