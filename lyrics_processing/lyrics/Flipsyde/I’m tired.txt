And dumbing down cause a country is illiterate
I'm tired of putting kids faces on them white tees
And not knowing the difference between them and me
Maybe a little luck maybe some education
My momma smoke weed. they momma freebasing
And neither one of us have a daddy that didn't make it
Maybe i didn't make it, maybe death hesitating
I'm tired of talking to myself and nobody feel me
Tired of talking shit to the devil as if he couldn't kill me
I'm tired of fools claiming they grind to feed they kids
Your kid's can't eat a hundred thousand dollar meals
I'm tired of hearing mother fuckers blaiming white people
I'm tired of white people blaiming my people
I'm tired of watching mickey mans try to keep it real
Keep it hood dog . and get your ass killed
Well i can see what you can't believe its suffocating and its hard to breathe
(fuck that i ain't ready yet)
We hear the truth still ya trying ya lies
Still ya broke young brother when ya ready to die
(i ain't ready yet)
I can see what you can't believe its suffocating and its hard to breathe
(fuck that i ain't ready yet)
We hear the truth still ya trying ya lies
Still ya broke when ya ready to die,... woooaahhh
I'm tired of being tired
I'm tired of talking shit
I'm tired of all you politicians and you hypocrites
Im tired of giving my hopes up to let them down
Im tired of black on black
Im tired of brown on brown
Violence to violins they playing loud
The government is hovering over the whole crowd
Tear gas and rubber bullets some of them real
Killing women and children. playa thats how ya feel
From libia to yemen the people gotta get it
Tunisia the beginning the knives never ending
Them hillbillys crazy they done lost they mind
The first generation to try and rewind time
You can't defeat god ya nothing but a speck
And when them people get tired they coming for ya neck
Cause you neglect to feed em and now they know you need them
The powers in the people in the tidal wave of freedom
Well i can see what you can't believe its suffocating and its hard to breathe
(fuck that i ain't ready yet)
We hear the truth still ya trying ya lies
Still ya broke young brother when ya ready to die
(i ain't ready yet)
I can see what you can't believe its suffocating and its hard to breathe
(fuck that i ain't ready yet)
We hear the truth still ya trying ya lies
Still ya broke when ya ready to die,... woooaahhh
(guitar riff)
Im just trying to limit myself by living limitless
Maintaining your composure in hopes of forgivingness
Greedy ass world with how we did the indigenous
Capitolistic, paternalistic, practice is a sin
Know we gonna have to change
Change just to maintain
Tame the lion thru heroin in his holy veins
Tame the children by building divisions in the system
Tame the poor addicted them to the jewels and denim
But they dont know whats in them
Whats in them is god
Just like you and me. know its some kinda odd
But if we focus on it put our hocus pocus on it
We can elevate the generation beat it up or own
Or what . the planet and thats our job damn
Tired of living in this box they taking advantage
Ask the wrong questions never get the right answers
Just look inside of ourselves so we can cure the cancer
