When you ask me for help then it's blasphemy
Cause I gave you everything that I had in me
Why you sittin' on ya ass and you mad at me
When I think about your life it's a tragedy
Wasn't nobody there to witness when I made this world
Created the sun, the moon, the boys and girls
I gave 'em the holy spirit and they chose to fear it
Now you fillin' up the churches cause the end is nearer
How dare you believe I could live in a house
See your body is the temple and you kicked me out
With the drugs and the drank and the murder and the rape
And you think it get erased Sunday when you pray?
You say that you believe but it ain't what you say
It's the life that you lead in the night and the day
I'm in the AK in the night when it spray
I'm the baby in the grave; I'm the life that you take
(Chorus:)
(Oh God) Don't call me, call the cops
(Oh God) I'm sorry but I know you not
(Oh God) You don't wanna feel my wrath
(Oh God) You still tryin' to hide ya past
(Bridge 2x:)
Oh God, please have mercy on me
Please, have mercy on me

Many souls line up for a chance at life
And I let 'em all know, it's a sacrifice
And they let it all go, in the name of love
Get born and bred to be hoes and thugs
And you cussin' at the kids and you steal their heart
See they came from the stars and you tear 'em apart
And you blame it on the devil but he don't exist
All this lawlessness, I'm all of this
Got love for ya soul but ya soul is numb
And I'm knowin' that you can't remember where you from
And the road get long with a heart a stone
I figured that it be better just to bring you home
And the world that ya in's gonna end from within'
Cause the minute that you sin, the destruction begins
It never was the plan turnin' dust into men
Just to have you turn around and not trust from within
(Chorus:)
(Oh God) Don't call me, call the cops
(Oh God) I'm sorry but I know you not
(Oh God) You don't wanna feel my wrath
(Oh God) You still tryin' to hide ya past
(Bridge 2x:)
Oh God, please have mercy on me
Please, have mercy on me
(Verse 3:)
From the black to the brown to the red and white
Every color in between from the dark to light
You don't wanna live together then prepare to fight
You don't wanna make it better then prepare to die
Made all of you different and I hoped you'd listen
Instead of killin' one another but the hope was missin'
And you starin' at ya brother like you scared to death
Realize when you die that you failed the test
See I made me a woman and you called her bitch
Then I made me a man and his throat was slit
So I made me a plan, made me a band
Background music while the whole world end
I'm the only reason why this old world spins
You commited treason let the sentencin' begin
Melt the ice caps you can see the sea rise
Flood each and everything I despise
Cuttin' all the trees now ya lungs can't breath
Ozone get depleted and you fry from UVs
Mountains gon' crumble, valleys gon' rise
Begging me to stop steady tellin' me lies
You could never change, your life's out of time
All the good people dead you are not one of mine
(You are not one of mine)2x
(Chorus:)
(Oh God) Don't call me, call the cops
(Oh God) I'm sorry but I know you not
(Oh God) You don't wanna feel my wrath
(Oh God) You still tryin' to hide ya past
(Bridge 2x:)
Oh God, please have mercy on me
