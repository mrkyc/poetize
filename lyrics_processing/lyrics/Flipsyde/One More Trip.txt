I got my guns out, pointed to the sky
Shoot for the stars, as I close my eyes
I wanna go back, yeah, back to paradise
One more trip is bound to take my life

I gotta turn life up to live
The only way to get most is to give
One way, headed in the wrong way
Paradise, gotta find my own way
Yeah, livin' ain't easy
Yeah, please believe me
I walked where the dead wind blows
Through the valley where no one goes

I see your secrets, yeah, behind your eyes
I feel your pain, deep inside girl

I got my guns out, pointed to the sky
Shoot for the stars, as I close my eyes
I wanna go back, yeah, back to paradise
One more trip is bound to take my life

Knowledge yourself, don't produce knowledge and wealth
I'm runnin' from self suicidal gunnin' for self
Separatin' me from me 'cause I'm a bad influence
I talked myself into it, doin' what I ain't 'pose to be doin'
Elevatin', transcient, that's the part of me pretendin'
From the beginnin', he been hypicritin', bullshittin'
Ain't have a road map, but he was smart enough to know that
Straight off track, but he was smart enough to go back
Or maybe forced back through the tug of war
'Tween the spirit and the mind, the evil and devined
The groupies in the line, the fronter from behind
No more liquor..the red wine
The Buddhist man told me 'go experince life'
And the Muslim said the opposite, well both of 'em right
And the Christian told me that 'I need to learn to believe'
The Athiest said the same, 'just believe in me.'

I got my guns out, pointed to the sky
Shoot for the stars, as I close my eyes
I wanna go back, yeah, back to paradise
One more trip is bound to take, is bound to take my life

I see your secrets (you know), behind your eyes
I feel your pain, deep inside girl
I got my guns out, pointed to the sky
Shoot for the stars, as I close my eyes
I wanna go back, yeah, back to paradise
