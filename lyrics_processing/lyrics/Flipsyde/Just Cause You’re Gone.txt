They let you know that your baby boy ain't come never be home
Cryin' alone and visited in scene in my mind
Us three better teamed as we walk through the night
Rides and roads will never look the same again
Used to be peaceful until the night they took my friend
I ain't have a scratch on me but my hart was crippled
So I'm bleed I it to the Song jelly gates are missin'
Just cause...

Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't it mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't it mean you have to go
Time is more precious then diamonds and cash
Once you spent it its gone forever and you can't make it last
Wasted in runnin around in circles chasing a cake
Never realizing your bullshitting before its too late

Get to split for a second and analyze my life
Same questions same answers
Same mirror ssame man
Time is tickin' that's why keep on day
That they livin', just cause...

Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
All alone i listen
To the silent whisper
Hid the leaving liquor
Now im feeling sicker
And my heart is strong 
But im feeling weak
So i sing a song
Cause your out of reach
They say the scene is believing but i can't fucking see it
Im losing all of my partners for no apparent reason
Gotta keep moving, Im knowing that i can't stop achieving
Either i win on this planet or i ain't fucking leaving
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
It doesn't mean you have to go
Just cause you're gone
