And if it all goes down
Yet tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be found
If you see what I believe
Let your sorrow, sorrow set you free
And if it all goes down
Yet tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be found
If you see what I believe
Let your sorrow, sorrow set you free

I've been travelling for so long, making tracks across this nation
I didn't evolve strong, strength, ...tion??
If I could focus on greatness, my future can't escape it
But my existence ain't given, I gots to fuckin' take it
Ain't nothing guaranteed, enjoy the air I breathe
With every phrase that I speak, I'm writing history
My baby brother's gone, and I can't wait to see him
But I got a fam' man, ain't no way I'll ever leave 'em!
Two sons, the way to their future is two turns
Gotta teach them about these cops, crooked bitches and rocks
Start 'em reading so these magicians can't ever decieve 'em
Teach them to think so they don't drown in this poisonous evil
(?)stars
My spirit (?)
But physically we fight and mentally we fall
It's all a circle, I'll read this script and play along, until tomorrow, when there's no such thing as right or wrong
