Happy birthday...
So make a wish

Please accept my apologies, wonder what would have been
Would you have been a little angel, or an angel of sin?
Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys
Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes
I paid for the murder before they determined the sex
Choosing our life over your life meant your death
And you never got a chance to even open your eyes
Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you fought for your life
Would you have been a little genius, in love with math?
Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad?
Would you have been a little rapper like your poppa, the Piper?
Would you have made me quit smoking by finding one of my lighters?
I wonder about your skin tone and shape of your nose
And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been
Happy birthday

What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake
You might also like
I got a million excuses, as to why you died
And other people got their own reasons for homicide
Who's to say it would have worked and who's to say it wouldn't have?
I was young and struggling, but old enough to be a dad
The fear of being my father has never disappeared
I ponder it frequently while I'm sipping on my beer
My vision of a family was artificial and fake
So when it came time to create, I made a mistake
Now you got a little brother, maybe it's really you
Maybe you really forgave us knowing we was confused
Maybe, every time that he smile it's you proudly
Knowing that your father is doing the right thing now
I never tell a woman what to do with her body
But if she don't love children, then we can't party
I think about it every year, so I picked up a pen
Happy birthday, I love you whoever you would have been
Happy birthday

What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
I made a mistake
From the heavens to the womb
To the heavens again
From the ending to the ending
Never got to begin
Maybe one day we can meet face to face
In a place without time and space
Happy birthday
From the heavens to the womb
To the heavens again
From the ending to the ending
Never got to begin
Maybe one day we can meet face to face
In a place without time and space
Happy birthday

What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
Happy birthday
What I thought was a dream
Make a wish
Was as real as it seemed
