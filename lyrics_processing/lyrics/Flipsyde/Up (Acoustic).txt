Late night feeling right but I'm dead wrong
Sunlight giving birth to a new song
Lord knows I done walked through the shadows
I done walked through the shadows
I'm on the other side of misery
Lay down my life for my liberty
Now I can finally let go, oh

So if it goes up, up, up
It must come down, down, down
So we put it in the air one time
And let it spread 'round, 'round and 'round

Keep spinning with me
Keep spinning with me
Keep spinning with me (Yeah)
Let it go 'round, 'round and 'round

Uh, I'm smoking on another idea
I'm working on what ain't right here
I travel longer than a light year
I damn sure ain't tryna die here (Die here)
You never miss it 'til it's gone, listen to this song
It might help you get along
A little right, a little wrong, smoke it in the bong
But don't hold it too long
I bear witness, life's vicious
The chick is all so delicious, I blow her kisses
I know she love me 'cause I'm gifted, but ain't we all?
She put the piper on a mission, ball or fall
I'm searching for the holy bridge, disconnectedness
Focus on the best in us
Good keep on blessing us while evil standing next to us
God ain't neglecting us, he already invest in us
So destiny is more or less with us, yup
You might also like
Yeah, if it goes up, up, up
It must come down, down, down
So we put it in the air one time
And let it spread 'round, 'round and 'round

Keep spinning with me
Keep spinning with me
Keep spinning with me
And let it go 'round, 'round and 'round

Look, and I'm not here to teach but when I speak I say they listen
And my dreams is within reach until I reach 'em then I'm pissed again
The flow is cold as frozen tadpoles in Lake Michigan
If you can't feel this shit then you must have cognitive dissonance
Walking through this world losing percentages of innocence
And life has been a bitch but I still love her 'til the end of it
That's friends with benefits, now stand up, put your hands up
Either man down or man up, yeah

So if it goes up, up, up
It must come down, down, down
So we put it in the air one time
And let it spread 'round, 'round and 'round
Keep spinning with me
Keep spinning with me
Keep spinning with me
And let it go 'round, 'round and 'round
Keep spinning with me
Keep spinning with me
Keep spinning with me
