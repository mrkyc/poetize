Huh, hey
I said, uh, ayy

I put a bullet up in the chamber today
These niggas wanna try me, I ain't with the games
Shorty, I love you, you're my lane of a change
All the walls closing in, but I ain't even fazed
Blaming me result into hate
She needs me, have someone to blame
I need peace with my .40 and a Range
I can't sleep at night, in my dreams

We do run-ups, uh
Why your gun tucked? Uh
They won't touch us, uh
They'll get done up, ayy
Shoot the club up, yeah
I love violence, ayy
Swallow my pride
With that fire, I'm the Ghost Rider
Ayy, huh, uh

I need a minute
How they comparin' me? I'm just beginning
Lie on my name, pressed, so now they want forgiveness
I'm 'bout my business, they all want my riches, uh
I feel like Batman, I might go slide in the night, uh
Stick with a blade like I got a fire to fight, uh
Jade on my necklace, uh, kryptonite in my eyes, uh
And I got a girl, the girl of my life, uh, uh
You want this energy, bet it's demons you invite
Got a new chopper, I bet it'll eat you alive
Gotta watch every step I take 'cause it's do or die
Load up my .40, little nigga, I'm finna slide

So I
