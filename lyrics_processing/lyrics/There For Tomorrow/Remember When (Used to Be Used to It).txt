Your initial reply hit me undercover
When I lost my head to it
It was out of its time, it was undiscovered
As I caught my breath again
You were running out of lies to keep me under
Afraid of your back hands
So to speak, you had me shaking at the knees

But I don't know the way out of this mess
No, I don't know the way out of this mess
And if you would've seen me at my best
Would it have changed anything at all?

Remember when we never had to remember
When times were better
When times were better than this
We never had to remember
When times were better
When times were better than this

The door was always open
But still not nearly enough to let me in
And my eyes are wide awake
And I can see you clearly
But you don't stand out one bit
I was always loud enough just for you to hear me
You never caught the wind
Now watch me break
Break down this time, this time again
You might also like

(When times were better, when times were better than this) 

And I'm still waiting for a sign
Or just a win-win situation
Can I hear it one more time?
Without the sound of devastation setting in
Your initial reply hit me undercover
When I lost my head to it
It was out of its time, it was undiscovered
When you let me in
Oh, won't you let me in?

Remember when we never had to remember
When times were better
When times were better than this
We never had to remember
When times were better
When times were better than this
Do you remember, remember when 
We never had to remember
When times were better
When times were better than this
