Like you said you would
The mutual understanding
Did I meet any of those demands you made so out of this world
Should I listen
When the winds blows
Cause it's blowing in a new direction
I can't help but feel like I'm affected
Get me out of this small world
So let me go (Let me go)
Somewhere where no one's ever been before
Light a fire (A burning fire)
Let it get out of control
Let me go
Somewhere where everybody breaks the mold
Paint a picture
That's bigger than your small (Your small), small sad world
Your small sad world
Do you feel it
Like I thought you would
I found you right where I left this
Never imagined your sideways preference would get out of this world
Do you see me through the looking glass
Smiling at my reflection
Came up short with your thin affection
Get me out of your small, sad world
You might also likeSo let me go (Let me go)
Somewhere where no one's ever been before
Light a fire (A burning fire)
Let it get out of control
Let me go
Somewhere where everybody breaks the mold
Paint a picture
That's bigger than your small (Your small), small, sad world
Your small sad world
Yeah
Minutes (Minutes)
Minutes (Minutes)
Have been changing my mind
Seconds (Seconds)
Seconds (Seconds)
I could do wthout your precious time
Should I listen when the wind blows?
Cause it's blowing in a new direction
Yeah it's blowing in a new direction
And I'm going...
Yeah
So let me go (Let me go)
Somewhere where no one's ever been before
Light a fire (A burning fire)
And let it get out of control
Out of control
Out of control
Somewhere where everybody breaks the mold
Light a fire
In your small, (Your small), small, sad world
So long
