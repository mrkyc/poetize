Another swallow never seemed like enough for him
They say the past is the past
But it never treated me like this
He couldn't ask for a better understanding of how
What goes around comes back around twice as fast
He's got no hope for a cure
So he'll put himself to sleep
Now we just sit back, we sit back
While we watch all of them react
So tell me what to tell you
When the world won't listen
The start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
Speak out and use up all the time you're given
The start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
Go on
Go ahead and tell your story
She always hoped for him to take her word for word
Never knew what it felt like feeling this unsure
She's got her eyes on the time
But there's no use waiting there for him
But she's not in the world alone
But she wanted to put herself to sleep
So tell me what to tell you
When the world won't listen
The start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
Speak out and use up all the time you're given
The start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
Go on
Go ahead and tell your story
And now we just sit back, we sit back
While we watch all of them react
So tell me what to tell you
When the world won't listen
The start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
Speak out and use up all the time you're given
The start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
Tell me what to tell you
When the world won't listen
The start to the finish
Come on and let me hear it
You've got to speak out
And use up all the time you're given
It's time to go on
