Where do you go when you listen
To nobody else but yourself?
Where do you go?
You're so far from the willing
You're in such a rush not to tell
So where do you go?

Oh, when getting in where your feet end
Doesn't get you one single thing
Where will you go?
When the secrets that you've been keeping
Get a hold of nothing at all
I'd like to know

Can I wish you away
'til you find your place?
In this world, it's so hard to get a feel
And all you do is wait
But then one little taste
So caught up, it's hard to know what's real
But until you've had all you can take
I'll wish you away
You might also like
So where do you when forgetting
What you had in store for yourself drags me along
Because you keep running in circles
You're blinded by everything
Just ask me if I know where to go
(Where to go)

Can I wish you away
'til you find your place?
In this world, it's so hard to get a feel
And all you do is wait
But then one little taste
So caught up, it's hard to know what's real
But until you've had all you can take
Oh, but until you've had all you can take
Can I wish you away?

Would you baby go backward?
(Can I wish you away?)
Would you baby go backward?
You say you'll be gone just another minute
Don't fall 
Don't act like you're sleeping
When I can see you're wide awake
Can I wish you away
'til you find your place?
In this world, it's so hard to get a feel
And all you do is wait
But then one little taste
So caught up, it's hard to know what's real
(Can I wish you away?)
Can I wish you away
'til you find your place?
In this world, it's so hard to get a feel
(Can I wish you away?)
And all you do is wait
But then one little taste
So caught up, it's hard to know what's real
But until you've had all you can take
