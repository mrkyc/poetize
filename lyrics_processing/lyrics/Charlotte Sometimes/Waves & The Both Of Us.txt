I want the whole nine yards
I want your hands on my hips
I want you kissing my lips
I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I take off your shirt, you pull up my skirt
And I can't wait forever boy
And the moon and the stars and the look in your eyes
Let them find its way into me, oh
And your skin on my skin and the bones that we're in
Let it slide your way into me, oh
I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I want your hands on my waste
There's no need to wait
I want to dance in the air
I want your hands in my hair
Releasing your breath as I undress
And I can't wait forever boy
And the moon and the stars and the look in your eyes
Let them find its way into me, oh
And your skin on my skin and the bones that we're in
Let it slide your way into me, oh, oh

I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
