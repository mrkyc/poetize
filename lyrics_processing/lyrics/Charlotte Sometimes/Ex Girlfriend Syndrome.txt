Tried going quietly
But the door slammed instead
I yelled, "Why'd I even come here?"
But still I stayed for a while
Looked in every draw that I could find
Saw you calendar on the floor
You're not very organized are you?
I said to myself, I said to myself
"You should go, you should leave"
Good side pulling on my sleeve
But I stood there, I stood there
With a note from my head
Opposite of what my heart said
Oh I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
I went through all your dirty laundry
Even those smelly socks
I wonder where, where those even came from
Saw everything you had lying around
From your deck of cards
To the way you feel about me
Just lying on the ground
You might also likeI said to myself, I said to myself
"You should go, you should leave"
Good side pulling on my sleeve
But I stood there, I stood there
With a note from my head
Opposite of what my heart said
Oh I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
I said to myself, I said to myself
"You should go, you should leave"
Good side pulling on my sleeve
But I stood there, I stood there
With a note from my head
Opposite of what my heart said
Oh I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
I should not be here you know I should not be here you know
