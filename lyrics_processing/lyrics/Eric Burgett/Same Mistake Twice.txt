I don't speed down Mill Road anymore
Since a 29 over 55
Citation, lesson on patience
Now I see the sign, buckle up, tap the breaks and
I don't drink every clear with a heavy pour
I change the oil in my truck every three or four
Thousand miles, down the road
But if I learned anything about us you wouldn't know

Ain't no better way to get me hurting
Than hoping you'll come back around
I'm thinking it can't get much worse than
The first time you showed me how
My heart just wants what it can't have
It didn't learn with one goodbye
So sometimes, some days and most nights
I make that same mistake twice

Bet you think I'm bitter from the break up
Bet you think I'm on to someone else
You'd be right every other time
But for us I'd run right back through hell
You might also like
Ain't no better way to get me hurting
Than hoping you'll come back around
I'm thinking it can't get much worse than
The first time you showed me how
My heart just wants what it can't have
It didn't learn with one goodbye
So sometimes, some days and most nights
I make that same mistake twice

Even if it drives me crazy
Even if I lose my mind
I'd take all that pain again
To call you baby one more time

Ain't no better way to get me hurting
Than hoping you'll come back around
I'm thinking it can't get much worse than
The first time you showed me how
My heart just wants what it can't have
It didn't learn with one goodbye
So sometimes, some days and most nights
I make that same mistake twice
Yeah I make that same mistake twice
Even if it drives me crazy
(I make that same mistake twice)
Even if I lose my mind
