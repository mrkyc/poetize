But I get as scared as any and I wish it wasn't so
And I don't like it
Any more than you do
But you'd better hold in spite of doubt
Left swinging to the right
Never lose what you found out
You can fight it if it doesn't kill you
You can fight it if you want to fight
We're going to make a listing of all the things we don't need
And then we will wean them slowly, all the fears we feed
And I don't like it
Any more than you do
Not any more than you do
But you'd better hold in spite of doubt
Sense swinging out of sight
Never lose what you found out
You can fight it if it doesn't kill you
But you'd better hold in spite of doubt
Left swinging to the right
Never lose what you found out
You can fight it if it doesn't kill you
You can fight it if you want to fight
No, no no
No, no no
You might also likeI don't like it
Any more than you do
I don't like it
Any more than you do
Not any more than you do
But you'd better hold in spite of doubt
Left swinging to the right
Never lose what you found out
You can fight it if it doesn't kill you
But you'd better hold in spite of doubt
Sense swinging out of sight
Never lose what you found out
You can fight it if it doesn't kill you
You can fight it if you want to fight
You can fight it if it doesn't kill you
You can fight it if you want to fight
You can fight it if it doesn't kill you
You can fight it if you want to fight
No, no no
