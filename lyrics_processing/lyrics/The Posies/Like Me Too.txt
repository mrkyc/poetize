Treat me casual, watch me, as you'll see I'm not too sure
I understand the tactful planning that I must endorse
But you call me immature because

I'm too sensitive to your insensitivity
I had the audacity to ask you to talk to me
The stones I throw shatter your sea of tranquility
You're about as human as the Statue of Liberty

But maybe you'll like me too
But maybe you'll like me too
Oh, oh

Kiss me, oblige me as if that's all I want from you
Then ignore me at the party, I invite you to
What did you think I'd dare to do?

Maybe I'd lose my sacred knack for subtlety
Perhaps you'd reveal that you actually like me
Did you ever think that I'd just bow out quietly?
All I wish for sometimes is you to sit down next to me
You might also like
And if you would like me too
If you would like me too
Oh, oh

Well maybe I can't force you to stand up and obey my will
I doubt you'll ever touch me or love me which is better still
I deified you once but now I'm standing on your hill
I see you eye to eye
And you're shrinking out of my sight
So before you have passed my line
Let's lower ourselves to each other

Thinly tie me to myself though you remain so free
I've tried in vain to demonstrate how you're tied as well to me
But you'll come around eventually

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Practice makes perfect and you practice perfection
But it's just a stage and I hope that some day when you're done

That maybe you'll like me too
I hope you will like me too
And if you would like me too
I pray that you'll like me too
