Cause I'm drawn to someone else
(Looks like you could use a little sleep)
I had some I didn't mention
You caught me coming late (framed by the door)
Onto a floor that's freshly waxed
And hides my tracks and raises
Some important questions
I ask you to be nice - it has no effect
And I suspect that you suspect
But didn't I say feelings are the last things to make themselves felt?
Don't make me explain myself - you don't need to know
What's going on in my big head right now
It could appear that I should have a statement prepared, but
Don't make me open my big mouth
The words come quickly I feel sick
I use that for an excuse to exit
Looks like you don't buy it
And I'm trying your patience
But what I leave unsaid sticks in my head
The guilt puts me in a spotlight
Looks like I might reveal
You're not my sole engagement
You might also likeI ask you to shut up - it's as I didn't
Know myself I wish you didn't
Know that I can't turn back, but I didn't plan to tell you that
Don't make me explain myself - you don't need to know
What's going on in my big head right now
It could appear that I could want to defend me, but
Don't make me open my big mouth
You tell me to get out - I can't get out of it
And I wish that we both could split
But splitting doesn't mean the end of the backlash that I couldn't defend
Don't make me explain myself - you wouldn't like what you find
Inside my, inside my big head
It could appear that I would want to reassure your doubts
Don't make me open my big mouth
Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me, don't make me
