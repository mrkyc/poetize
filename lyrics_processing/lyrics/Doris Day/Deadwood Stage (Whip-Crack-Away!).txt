Oh! The Deadwood Stage is a-rollin' on over the plains
With the curtains flappin' and the driver slappin' the reins
Beautiful sky! A wonderful day!
Whip crack-away! Whip crack-away! Whip crack-away!

Oh! The Deadwood Stage is a-headin' on over the hills
Where the Injun arrows are thicker than porcupine quills
Dangerous land! No time to delay!
So, whip crack-away! Whip crack-away! Whip crack-away!

We're headin' straight for town, loaded down, with a fancy cargo
Care of Wells and Fargo, Illinois - Boy!

Oh! The Deadwood Stage is a-comin' on over the crest
Like a homing pigeon that's a-hankerin' after its nest
Twenty-three miles we've covered today
So, whip crack-away! Whip crack-away! Whip crack-away!

The wheels go turnin' round, homeward bound
Can't you hear 'em humming
Happy times are coming for to stay - hey!
You might also like
We'll be home tonight by the light of the silvery moon
And our hearts are thumpin' like a mandolin a-plunking a tune
When I get home, I'm fixing to stay
So, whip crack-away! Whip crack-away! Whip crack-away!
Whip crack-away! Whip crack-away! Whip crack-away!

Introducin' Henry Miller
Just as busy as a fizzy sasparilla
He's a showman and he's smarter
Operates the Golden Garter
Where the cream of Deadwood City come to dine
And I'm glad to say he's a very good friend of mine

Hi Joe, say where d'you get them fancy clothes?
I know! Off some fellow's laundry line
Hi Beau, aren't you the Prairie Rose
Smelling like a watermelon vine

Here's a man the Sheriff watches
On his gun there's more 'n twenty-seven notches
On the draw there's no-one faster
And you're flirting with disaster
When Bill Hickok's reputation you malign
And I'm glad to say he's a very good friend, of a friend of mine
Oh my throats as dry as a desert thistle in May
In the Golden Garter gonna wet my whistle today
Last to the bar's a three-legged crow
Set 'em up, Joe, set 'em up, Joe, set 'em up Joe
