There's been a new invention
It isn't any larger than an adding machine
It's only fair to mention
Though it's a new invention
It's one that you have heard about but few have ever seen
It doesn't do division and it doesn't multiply
It doesn't want to be a bird, it doesn't try to fly
It came about because they made a big atomic bomb
The new invention's clicking and because of all its ticking
I know where the idea came from
I tic, tic, tic, why do I tic, tic?
What amazing trick, makes me tic, tic, tic
I tic, tic, tic, an electric tic
When I feel a realistic tic
You're such an attractive pick
Give me a radioactive kick
It's distracted the way you stick
But love, love makes me tic
I tic, tic, tic and my heart beats quick
How can anything go wrong?
When I'm listening to that Geiger counter song
I tic, tic all day long
You might also likeI tic, tic, tic, why do I tic, tic?
What amazing trick, makes me tic-tic-tic-tic-tic
I tic, tic, tic, an electric tic
When I feel a realistic tic
Butcher and the baker tic
So does the maker of the candlesticks
Lawyers have their politics
But love, love makes them tic
So tic, tic, tic, let your heart tic, tic
How can anything go wrong?
If you're listening to that Geiger counter song
You'll tic, tic all day long
Like the butcher and baker tics
Like the candlestick maker tics
Like the doctor and the lawyer tics
Even though he's mixed up in his politics
Like the merchant and the Indian chief tic-tics
Like the poor, like the rich man tic-tic-tics
Digging a ditch man, the butter and egg man
The poor wooden leg man, the beggar and thief
All found out what its all about
When its love you can't be wrong
You better listen to that Geiger counter song
And tic tic all day long
Tic, tic-tic-tic, tic, tic, tic-tic-tic, tic, tic, tic-tic-tic
