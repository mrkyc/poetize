I'm wide awake
It's the middle of the night
Standin' in the dark
Waitin' up for the light

And here I'll remain
'Til the sun is in the sky
Standin' in the dark
Waitin' up for the light

There is love
There is peace
In this world
So take it back
Say it's not what you had thought
Grab a hold
Take these melodies
With your hands
Write a song to sing
Isn't such a bad bad world and I say

Whoo hoo whoo hoo whoo hoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo whoo hoo whoo hoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo whoo hoo whoo hoo hoo hoo

These times are strange
I can feel it in the night
Standin' in the dark
Holdin' up for the light

And here I remain
'Til the great sun shines
Standin' in the dark
Waitin' up for the light

There is love
There is peace
In this world
So take it back
Say it's not what you had thought
Grab a hold
Take these melodies
With your hands
Write a song to sing
It isn't such a bad bad world and I say

There is love
There is peace
In this world
So take it back
Say it's not what you had thought
Grab a hold
Take these melodies
With your hands
Write a song to sing
It isn't such a bad bad world
(Bad bad world)
Bad bad world
(Bad bad world)
Bad bad world and I said
Whoo hoo whoo hoo whoo hoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo whoo hoo whoo hoo hoo hoo
Whoo hoo whoo hoo whoo hoo hoo hoo
