We were young, twenty-one
All those years ago
In came the fascination
Everything was out of control
A life, untried
From thickets and from thorns
Out came a revelation
Everything was out of control

Do you feel it?
Do you feel it now?
Cause we want it
But we don't know how
Do we have it?
As much as anybody ever has

I want to wake you from your dream
I want to know just who you're talking to
When you're singing in your sleep
I want to find out what it means
Do you love me?

Now we're fine, alight
But all those days are gone
We read our constellations
Everything is under control
Are you tired? (I'm tired)
I'm tired
The TV sparks and glows
The newsman gives information
Everything is under control

I want to wake you from your dream
I want to know just who you're talking to
When you're singing in your sleep
I want to find out what it means
Do you love me?

I got marbles in my mouth
A thousand words I want to say
But it's impossible to spit them out
I can barely make a sound
Do you love me?
