There we stand about to fly
Peeking down over land, parachute behind
What was that moment for which we live
Without a parachute about to dive?

Find my self convincing
Blindly falling faster
How easy
Oh, know the place I'm leaving
And the rest just is gone

Oh the adoration
But how much strength does it take?
For exploration, for split decision
Oh are you stronger to remain? Oh

Find myself convincing
I'm blindly falling faster
How easy
Oh, know the place I'm leaving
And the rest just is gone

It crept up on me
Ignored all my pleas
Begging to leave
No justice to maim me
Fell out of the sky
Cease it to be
Without a reply
Gravity fails me
And when I awoke
I knew what was real
Hope to convince you
Lies they all torture me
Opened the door
Knew what was me
I finally realized
Parachute over me
Parachute over me
Parachute over me

(It crept up on me)
Ignored all my pleas
Begging to leave
No justice to maim me
Fell out of the sky
Cease it to be (oh, oh)
Without a reply
Gravity fails me
And when I awoke
I knew what was real (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hope to convince you
Lies they all torture me
Opened the door
Knew what was me
I finally realized
Gravity fails me (Na na na na)
And when I awoke (Na na na na)
I knew what was real
Hope to convince you (Na na)
Lies they all torture me
Opened the door
Knew what was me
I finally realized
(Parachute over me)
Gravity fails me
And when I awoke
I knew what was real
Hope to convince you
(Parachute over me)
Lies they all torture me
Opened the door
Knew what was me
I finally realized (oh, oh)
Gravity fails me
And when I awoke
I knew what was real
Hope to convince you (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Lies they all torture me
Opened the door
