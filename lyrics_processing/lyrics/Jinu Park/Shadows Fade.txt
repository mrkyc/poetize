Baby you know that im tryin
But you makin it hard to leave
And a part of me is dying (dying)
Whoa oh oh
It shines where we used to walk
Sunsets in the pillowtalk
Can't see when its getting dark
Whoa oh oh

Dont wanna admit to myself
That im a quitter no..
But this light ain't getting brighter

Baby you
You know i gotta go away
And i know youre gonna be okay
Coming round a little late
And watch our shadows fade
You might also likeRemember all the love we make
When tomorrow turns to yesterday
Wishing that you made the change
And watch our shadows fade

Looking at this empty home
Are we ready to be lonely ghosts?
Reminding us of who we were
Whoa oh oh
Darkness hides what we deny
If we conceal our selfish lies
Locked away without a crime
Whoa oh oh

Dont wanna admit to myself
That im a quitter no..
But this light ain't getting brighter

Baby you
You know i gotta go away
And i know youre gonna be okay
Coming round a little late
And watch our shadows fade
Remember all the love we make
When tomorrow turns to yesterday
Wishing that you made the change
And watch our shadows fade

Its time to shine or we blacking out
We can break up or we break it down
All our problems here and now
All our problems here and now
Its time to shine or we blacking out
We can break up or we break it down
All our problems here and now
Or watch our shadows fade away

Baby you
You know i gotta go away
And i know youre gonna be okay
Coming round a little late
And watch our shadows fade
Remember all the love we make
When tomorrow turns to yesterday
Wishing that you made the change
