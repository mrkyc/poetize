The more I fight the day
The more it drags on
And no blues can sing it away
I just gotta press on
The more you talk to me, baby
The more I cry
Just leave me quickly, save me
From the darkness you provide

It's just too hard
It's just too hard to deal with
It's just too much
It's just too much to deal with
I had enough
So hang up on my call

Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get control of my focus
I can't take this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more
Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get me out from under
I can't take this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more

Don't make me love you like I love you now
Please

You swore you'd love me forever
But you'd rather stay away
You promised we'd be together
Are you expecting me to wait
For an imaginary day
To come and fix this pain?
Baby, I know what you're doing
And it's a shameful game to play
Who exactly do you think I am?
You're not gonna wipe your feet on me
Just tell me straight
Let there be no mistaking

It's just too hard
It's just too hard to deal with
It's just too much
It's just too much to deal with
I had enough
So hang up on my call
Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get control of my focus
I can't take this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more
Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get me out from under
I can't take this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more

Don't make me
Don't make me love you like I love you now

Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, oh, oh, oh
You know that I don't feel right without you
And you kind of like the option
Of falling back into my love
Whenever you feel like
Way down in the shadows
I can make out just a chink of light
But the window is just to high
Freedom's asking me why I can't make the climb
High, high, high, high, I, I, I, I
High
Why can't I make it?
Why you're holding on?
Why you're holding on to me?
Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get control of my focus
I can't take this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more
Let me be, let me breathe
Let me get me out from under
I can't take this feeling no more
Please don't make me love you no more

You gotta let me go now
Let me move on
Let me be
