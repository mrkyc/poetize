Ooh, no

Little angels
Whisper softly
While my heart melts
For you and I'll see
Only sunshine
Only moonlight
For the first time
It's real

And the higher you take me
The more that you make me
Feel so hazy
Tell me what this means

I got jet lag
And I never even left the ground
See, it's like that
Every time you come around
Oh, I'm so hungover
And I never even touched a drop
See, I can't get enough
This must be love (Jet lag, jet lag)

You're mine

And the higher you take me
The more that you make me
Feel so hazy
Tell me what this means

I got jet lag
And I never even left the ground
See, it's like that
Every time you come around
Oh, I'm so hungover
And I never even touched a drop
See, I can't get enough
This must be love (Jet lag, jet lag)

Tell me, what does this mean?
