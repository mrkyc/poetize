Can't you hear the ocean crying
Calling out to be revived?
Take a step back, realize
We all need to make a plan
Reverse effects of common man
Take a moment, open your eyes

We're taking our time, can't keep running, running
Take the water into your hand
I'm feeling a change that is coming, coming
The sooner that we understand

Just a drop of rain, that's all I am
And we're all the same
We have the power to make a wave
If we move together as one, oh
There's no time to waste, actions are louder
Don't hesitate
And I see the future, it's ours to take
We are the ocean
We are the ocean
We are the ocean

When there's nowhere left to go
In a world where nothing grows
Make a choice to sink or swim
Fields of blue are turning black
How did we get so off-track
Across our seven seas?

We're taking our time, can't keep running, running
Take the water into your hand
I'm feeling a change that is coming, coming
The sooner that we understand

Just a drop of rain, that's all I am
And we're all the same
We have the power to make a wave
If we move together as one, oh
There's no time to waste, actions are louder
Don't hesitate
And I see the future, it's ours to take
We are the ocean
We are the ocean
We are the ocean
There's no time to waste
Actions are louder (We are the ocean)
Don't hesitate, no (We are the ocean)
I see the future with pride
We can make a change (We are the ocean)
If we stick together as one (We are the ocean)
Just a drop of rain (We are the ocean)
Yes, we're all the same (We are the ocean)
We have the power
To make a change (We are the ocean)
So come on now
Make it up, make it up for me, love (We are the ocean)

Just a drop of rain, that's all I am
And we're all the same
We have the power to make a wave
