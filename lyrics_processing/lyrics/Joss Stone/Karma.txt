Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh-ho!
Hmm

If I was just a little bit stronger, baby
Could have made it last a little bit longer maybe
Could have made it on my own
I should've just let you go
I should have been a little bit stronger, baby
If I was just a little bit sweeter, baby
I know, I know, I know
I wouldn't be here alone
Thank God I'm a little bit meaner, baby

I am what I am
You did what you did
I'm glad I'm not a sinner, baby
'Cause here's the twist
You are what you are
I saw what I saw
Karma's your master
And you're the bitch

Yeah

You could've tried a little bit harder, baby
You could have been a little smarter, baby
I tried not to see
When you were on and off of me
You could have tried a little bit harder, baby

I am what I am
You did what you did
I'm glad I'm not a sinner, baby
'Cause here's the twist
You are what you are
And I saw what I saw
Karma's your master
And you're the bitch

Yes, you are
Yeah

Now I got a loaded gun now, baby
Gonna love to watch you run like a lady
And cry like a baby
Just like I did when you had gone, oh
Hmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, ah
Oh-ho
See, I, I
I should have been a little bit stronger
I should have been a little bit harder
Should have been a little bit tougher
Should have been a little bit smarter
Should have been a little bit rougher
Should have been a little bit stronger
Should have run a little bit faster
Away from you, baby
Away from you
Oh!


I made it on my own
Now the feeling's gone
