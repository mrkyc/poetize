(Don't you dare)
Interrupt the White House ball
(We're living scared)
It's in foreign fields the soldiers fall
Ooh, ooh, ooh, la, la, la
Snatch 'em in their prime
Go ahead, that's fine, that's fine
Just go drill for grease
Mm, yeah
Like a diamond thief, yeah, yeah
Their mamas will be alright
Just give 'em time
Go get your money right
You won't lose no sleep tonight

Nominate your kids, I think they prove your theory right
Would you watch them die?

Like tryna get a hold of smoke and water
Coming up with nothing every time
How come we ain't gettin' any closer?
Tryna find the truth behind the lies
See Joss Stone LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like
(Look up, look up)
See a dead man walking
(See his baby face)
Hey, let's duplicate a few
Ooh, ooh, ooh
La, la (La, la)
That don't mean much to you
(If you need some help)
Send some hippies in to help
You think more than you do
How's about another line or two
To pick you up, pick you up
While your people drown, drown

I hope you're happy and you sleep so great at night
While the lovers cry

Like tryna get a hold of smoke and water
Coming up with nothing every time
How come we ain't gettin' any closer?
Tryna find the truth behind the lies

How many lives will you sacrifice?
Will you ever be satisfied?
If in God you trust, can't you hear Him still?
I ain't no preacher, but thou shall not kill (Uh, uh)
Yo, check it
I'm praisin' it stays in the streets I'm raised in
Pain is the perfume scent I'm sprayed in
At class with a federal agent's fragrance
I smell a pig, that's a cop who racist
I'm an ordinary project dude
I'm subject to genetically modified food
That's FDA-approved, mass-produced
If we can tell a lie from the truth
Even though I'm fly up in my Tom Ford suit
Learjet like a Concorde swoop through the air
Then I land in my Phantom Coop
And I still stand with the Ugandan youth
Or the poor kids out in Moscow that live hostile
I ride for you when I ride with the top down
Listenin' to Joss sounds, you see how that feel
Our CDs come with government seals

Open it, peep Nas gettin' at his enemies
In the paragraphs and for similes
Governmentalists killed the Kennedys
I heard that Joss Stone got the remedy

Governmental confusion
Governmentalist, it's delusion
Governmental confusion
A bunch of governmentalists, it's delusion
Tryna get a hold of smoke and water
Coming up with nothing every time
How come we ain't gettin' any closer?
Tryna find the truth behind the lies
And all that we're left with
Is a hand full of nothing, yeah
A hand full of nothing, that's all that I got
Hand full of nothing, yeah
Governmental confusion
Just some governmentalist, it's delusion
Governmental confusion, yeah
