In the game of love
It takes all you got
Just to keep it moving up
And don't you wanna reach the top?
But Heaven seems
Such a crazy dream
If your heart has room for doubt
You're neither in, you're neither out

Ninety-nine and a half, it just won't do
You gotta give me all of you
Not asking too much of a heart that's true
So tell me

What's the name of the game that we are playing?
But whenever I think that we are winning
Then you roll the dice, take a slide
Right back to the one from '99
Is it gonna go on like this forever?
Are we gonna take that last step together?
Going 'round and 'round and up and down
Feels just like Snakes and Ladders

Baby, don't it feel
Like a carousel?
Where all the world is rushing by
But when it stops, you realise
That you're right back
Where you started at
I need a little more than that
It's time for us to face the facts

Whether to be or not to be
That is the question, so it seems
We're going nowhere in between
So tell me

What's the name of the game that we are playing?
But whenever I think that we are winning
Then you roll the dice, take a slide
Right back to the one from '99
Is it gonna go on like this forever?
Are we gonna take that last step together?
Going 'round and 'round and up and down
Feels just like Snakes and Ladders
Don't wanna play this game no more
I gotta know right now for sure
What am I giving my heart for
Baby, I need a little more
Don't leave me hanging on a string
Now that I gave you everything
Not when I play to win
Snakes and Ladders

What's the name of the game that we are playing?

Then you roll the dice, take a slide
Right back to the one from '99
