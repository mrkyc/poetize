Mm, yeah
Hey
Aright now
Ooh

And I got you on the back foot
And you know I got you really good
'Cause there's something deep inside of me
I got to be
And if you find it hard to follow me
If I lose you in my jet stream
Then you only gotta raise your eyes
And see me fly

Don't tell me that I won't, I can
Don't tell me that I'm not, I am
Don't tell me that my master plan
Ain't comin' through, yeah
Don't tell me that I won't, I will
Don't tell me how to think, I feel
Don't tell me 'cause I know what's real
What I can do

Through a world that's designed to break
All of your dreams

It's that there's nothing that you can't do
'Cause it's all about your attitude
