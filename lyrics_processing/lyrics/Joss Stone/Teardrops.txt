Oh
Ooh, ooh, oh

Whenever I hear goodbyes
Reminds me, baby, of you
I break down and cry
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance
Reminds me, baby, of you
I took a crazy chance
Next time I'll be true
I'll be true
I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance floor
Reminds me, baby, of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune
