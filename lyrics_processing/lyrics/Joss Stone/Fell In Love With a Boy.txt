Fell in love with a boy
I fell in love once and almost completely
He's in love with the world
And sometimes these feelings can be so misleadin
He turns and says "are you alright?"
Oh, I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating
Come and kiss me by the riverside
Sarah says it's cool, she don't consider it cheating

Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah, oh
Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah, oh
Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah, oh
Ah-ah-ha-ah-ah, oh

Red hair with a curl
Mello-roll for the flavor and the eyes were peeping
Can't keep away from the boy
The two sides of my brain need to have a meeting

Can't think of anythin' to do
My left brain knows all of love is fleeting
He's just lookin' for somethin' new
I said it once before but it bears repeating
