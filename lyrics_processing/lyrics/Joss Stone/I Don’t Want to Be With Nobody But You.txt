Bet you think that I don't love you, baby
Bet you think that I-I, I don't care, mm
But I wanna tell you that you got something
And I'm loving it with all my heart
I don't wanna ever part

I don't wanna be with nobody but you, no, no
I don't wanna be with no one but you
I wanna be wrapped up in the arms of a mighty man, hmm
Come on and wrap me
Wrap me in your arms because I know you can, hmm

Don't you know that you can call on me, baby
All you gotta do is say you will, nah
'Cause I'm ready just to love you
And put an end to all your doubts
I know we can work it out

I don't wanna be with nobody but you, no, no
I don't wanna be with no one but you
I wanna be wrapped up in the arms of a mighty man, yes, I do
(Come on and wrap me)
Wrap me in your arms because I know you can, ah
