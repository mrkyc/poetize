Love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss, please
Love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss, please

I just can't take one more lover
Putting me under his other
I felt the pain
No more again (No, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I'll give you all I can cover (Ooh)
Just promise you'll be my protector (Ooh, ooh)
Look out for my fears
And keep them well clear
They'll be no problems here
I'm asking you to

Well, I guess I'm 'bout to find out
If there's truth in your soul
Your smile, your eyes
Are not enough alone (Not enough, love; not enough, love)
Is this a girl's intuition? (Yes)
This impossible love supposition (Supposition)
Bring me some light (Bring me some)
Refresh (Bring me some) my life (Bring me some)
I've built a wall (Bring me some)
Strong and tall and wide

Take me as the one you chose
Promise you my eyes, put your lips on my kiss, please
Love me from your heart
Love me from your soul
Take me as the one you chose

Now don't give me those eyes
If it's meaningless, please hide it
