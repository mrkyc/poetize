Mm
Oh, oh

Been a lot that I've been through
I've cried a tear a time or two, baby
You know I cried some over you
Had my heart kicked to the ground
Love ripped me up and tore me down, baby
But that ain't enough to break me

'Cause I'll rise above it
And I'll pick myself up
And I'll dust the pain off
Of my heart

And I'll be alright
And I'll love again
And the wounds will mend
I'm bruised but not broken
And the pain will fade
I'll get back on my feet
It's not the end of me
My heart is still open, I'm
Bruised but not broken, oh

Been a lot of tear-stained nights
I thought the tears were here for life, baby
The hurt came on and held on tight
I took a chance, I took a fall
Love broke my heart and shattered all my dreams
But I won't be down on my knees

'Cause I'll rise above it
And I'll pick myself up
And I'll shake the rain out
Of my heart

And I'll be alright
And I'll love again
And the wounds will mend
I'm bruised but not broken
And the pain will fade
I'll get back on my feet
It's not the end of me
My heart is still open, I'm
Bruised but not broken, oh

Gonna pick my heart up
Take my life back, shake the hurt away
Pull myself together
Put the pieces back in place
See, I've learned love's so hard
Love left my soul scarred
Was shattered inside
You shattered me, baby
And I'll be alright
And I'll love again
And the wounds will mend
I'm bruised but not broken
And the pain will fade
I'll get back on my feet
It's not the end of me
My heart is still open, I'm
Bruised but not broken
And I'll be alright (Said I'll be alright)
And I'll love again (And I'm gonna love again)
And the wounds will mend (My wounds gon' mend)
I'm bruised but not broken (My wounds are gonna mend)
And the pain will fade (Said I'll be alright)
I'll get back on my feet
It's not the end of me (Don't gotta tell me, baby)
My heart is still open, I'm (I'm worn, but I'm so not broken, baby)
Bruised but not broken (I'm so far from broken now)

Ooh
Mhm
Bruised but not broken
Bruised but not
I'm not broken
Mm
