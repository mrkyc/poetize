Please don't think that I owe ya
Look at what you put me through
If I had a chance to plan what I would say to you
I'd turn around so beautiful
And look you in the eye just to prove I don't love you
Or need you
Clouding my mind
In darkness I'll find
Nothing at all, at all, at all

Baby, can't you hear this sound?
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love that we've found at all, at all
Baby, won't you realize?
You know that I'm not your prize
Why we wasting our time?
To me you're nothing at all

Please don't think I'll forget ya
Nothing in the world could move
All the scars that you gave me
Memories I just can't lose
If I had a chance to show ya
How it feels, you know I would do
My best to test
How heartless you really are
To me you're nothing at all
To me you're nothing at all, at all, at all

Baby, can't you hear this sound?
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love that we've found at all, at all
Baby, won't you realize?
You know that I'm not your prize
Now why we wasting our time?
To me you're nothing at all
To me you're nothing at all

Why don't you, why don't you leave me?
Go, get out
Turn around
'Cause I got a mouth
That'll knock you down
And when it's over
You won't know what hit you
'Cause you'll be looking up at me from the ground
(Ooh, ooh)
Won't you take the time to lay it all out
On the table and figure this out?
Reality is staring us right in the face
I'm in a place I can't seem to turn around
Something's gotta give, we can start to live
Without having to shout so loud
Relationship's a trip with a lack of light
It's the time we need to get out
Get out (Ooh, ooh)
Get out (Ooh, ooh)
We need to get out
Baby, can't you hear this sound?
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love
This ain't love
This ain't love
Baby, won't you realize?
You know that I'm not your prize
Now why we wasting our time?
To me you're nothing
To me you're nothing
You're nothing at all
And this ain't love
This ain't love that we've found

See, I know love don't look like this
(No, love don't look like this; no, love; no, love; no, love)
And I know love don't taste nothing like this
Nothing at all
(No, love don't look like this; no, love; no, love; no, love)
'Cause I've had enough
I've had enough of your lack of love
(No, love don't look like this; no, love; no, love; no, love)
I've had enough of this bad taste
Had enough of you wasting my time
(No, love don't look like this; no, love; no, love; no, love)
To me you're nothing at all
(No, love don't look like this; no, love; no, love; no, love)
Nothing at all
