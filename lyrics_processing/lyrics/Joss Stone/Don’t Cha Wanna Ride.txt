I know you got the Hummer for the summer, baby
But I got your number, baby, I got your number, baby

I was tryin' to protect you
From yourself 'cause I respect you
And I feel like you just might
Be someone who I could get into
But I never seem to catch your eye
And it's been buggin' me why I even try
Still, you're someone I'd like to get to know
Is there room for me in your one-man show?

A car this fine
Don't pass your way every day
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
A car this fine
Don't pass your way every day
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
Time is slippin'
By, by, by, by
Slippin' by

I was tryin' to connect with you
But you act scared when I'm checkin' you
And all my girls say you're hard to please
But I think that I got just what you need
Get your face out of the mirror
Then, maybe, you could consider
This girl who's knockin' right at your door
Make room for me in your one-man show, oh

A car this fine
Don't pass your way every day
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
A car this fine
Don't pass your way every day
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
Time is slippin'
By, by, by, by
Oh

I know you got the Hummer for the summer, baby
But I got your number, baby, I got your number, baby
I know where you live, I know all 'bout your crib
But do you, do you, do you, do you know that they can't give you what I give?
No, no, nah
Ooh, ooh
A car this fine
Don't pass your way every day (You ever seen a car this fine? Oh)
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
So don't you wanna ride, baby?
A car this fine (Time has gone to waste)
Don't pass your way every day (You better tell me to my face)
Don't you wanna ride, baby? (Do you feel me, baby?)
Get real with me, baby
A car this fine (Time waits for no man)
Don't pass your way every day (You better catch me while you can)
Don't you wanna ride, baby? (Get real with me, baby)
Do you feel me, baby? Ooh, yeah
A car this fine (Ooh)
Don't pass your way every day, every day
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
Don't you wanna ride, baby? Baby, baby (Uh)

A car this fine
Don't pass your way every day
Don't you wanna ride, baby?
