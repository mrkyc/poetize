New life, first breath
Clean water, stressless
Bright lights, no test
So you oughta get dressed

Just so you know, you're blessed (Ooh, ooh)
Move on, forget the rest (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Put away your clouds, it's a brand new day (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
It's time to clean your head (Ooh, ooh)
Get out of bed instead (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Let the sunshine in, don't waste your day (Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Today is the day you'll find your love is in you
And it's been right there the whole time
Today is the day you'll realize you can do
Whatever's on your mind

New life, first breath
Clean water, stressless
Bright light, no test
So you oughta get dressed
Feel right, your soul rest
Check your order, manifest
In sight, no regrets
Love your life, regardless
