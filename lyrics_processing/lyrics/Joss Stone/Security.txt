A loss that would've thrown
A hole through anybody's soul
And you were only human after all
So don't hold back the tears, my dear
Release them so your eyes can clear
I know that you will rise again
But you gotta let them fall

I wish that I could snap my fingers, erase the past, but no
You cannot rewind reality once the tape's unrolled

If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
I will help you put the pieces back a little more each day
And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key
Lay your head upon my shoulder, I'll set you free
I'll be your security

Mm, oh, a moment of despair
That forces you to say that life's unfair
It makes you scared of what tomorrow may bring, oh
But don't go giving into fear
Stop hiding all alone in there
The show keeps going on and on
But you'll miss the whole damn thing

I wish I had a crystal ball to see what the future holds
But we don't know how the story ends till it's all been told

If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
I will help you put the pieces back a little more each day
And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key
Lay your head upon my shoulder, I'll set you free
I'll be your security

On any clock upon the wall
The time is always now
So, baby, kiss the past goodbye
Don't let the future blow your mind
Just sit back and chill
Take things as they come
You can't be afraid (Can't be afraid)
To live for today (Live for today)
I will be with you
Each step of the way

If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain, ooh, no
I will help you put the pieces back bit by bit each and every day
If your heart is locked and you can't find the key, oh, oh
Lay your head upon my shoulder, I'll set you free
I'll be your security
If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
If you're hurting each time
I will help you put the pieces back
Oh, dry the tears you cry
If your heart is locked and you can't find the key
Ooh, ooh, no
Lay your head upon my shoulder, I'll set you free
I'll be your security, oh

I'll be there for you to lean on
When you need a friend, when you need a friend, oh
Lay your head upon my shoulder, lean on me
