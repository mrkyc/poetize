I'm feelin' butterflies (I feel it too, huh)

Somethin' 'bout the look in your eyes, oh
Ooh, it just makes me feel so right, oh (What you feelin' now?)

When my mind's void, you're my joy
You're the dream when I sleep
And, hey, I'm for ya, yeah, I adore
You're everything that I need (It's alright)

Right now, let's stay in the present
Can't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause today is a blessin'
The world in a state of aggression
I find calm in you, I see my mom in you
It's like the feeling in your stomach when you want it so bad
If we keep keeping it fresh, it ain't gonna go bad
I've been through the valley of love
Rode through shores of Cali just to find piece of mind
Looking to the sky, asking for at least a sign (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Beautiful you came at such a decent time (Ooh)
When we combine, it's like good food and wine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Flavorful, yet refined, you remind me of the divine (Ooh)
So easy, love can be lost and then found like Stevie (You found me, baby)
I just love having you around (Ooh, my love, I love you)
You wearing the gown, I'm wearing the crown pound for pound
We the freshest couple in town, in town

When my mind's void, you're my joy, you're my dream
Hey, I'm for ya, I adore ya, you're everything that I need
And I love how you love me, baby, ooh
I'm made for you, ooh, you're made for me, oh
Ooh, tell me what we're gonna do
