They say time waits for no man
And neither does this woman
I've been trying hard to understand
What it be
Many moons have come and gone
And this little heart's still holding on
To a "could be, maybe should be"
Baby, crazy is all it's making me

I've been holding on
For way too long
It can't go on

You've got four and twenty hours
Just one day to prove to me
That your love has got the power
Make me believe you'll take me where I wanna be
Four and twenty hours (Hours)
