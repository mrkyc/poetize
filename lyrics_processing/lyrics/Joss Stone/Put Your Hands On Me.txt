One, two, three

I guess I'm picky with love
Well, baby, I give up, it's you I choose
And don't keep me waitin'
This girl's got things she needs to do

Oh, if I was blind, you'd help me see (Me see)
If I lost my mind, you'd find it for me
Speak on it, babe, tell me, what do you need?
Because all I need is you to love me, baby

Put your hands on me, baby
Put your hands on me, baby (Ooh)
You got me flippin'
Put your hands on me, baby
Put your hands on me, baby (Ooh)
Oh

Can't stop my mind from thinkin' of ya
How am I supposed to function?
Got me feelin' for your lips on my kiss
Oh, I never want no other lover

Baby, I'm hungry, want and I need (I need)
To bring me your sugar and pour it all over me, baby

Put your hands on me, baby
Put your hands on me, baby (Ooh)
You got me flippin'
Put your hands on me, baby
Put your hands on me, baby (Ooh)
One touch, I'm trippin'

Up till now, my eyes could see (See)
Touch me once and it's all hazy
I don't know why and I don't know how
But somehow, some way, you got me

I can't explain, can't comprehend
The world could reach its very end and all I focus on is him, oh
The way he moves, he found his groove, there's nothin' left to do
But tell the world the truth 'cause there's no way out
I love him (Love him), I feel him (Feel him)
Ooh, I'm lovin' those hands
Put your hands on me, baby
Put your hands on me, baby
You got me flippin' (Ooh)
Oh, one more time
Put your hands on me, baby
Put your hands on me, baby (Ooh)
One taste, I'm trippin'
Just kiss me, baby, tell me you're mine
