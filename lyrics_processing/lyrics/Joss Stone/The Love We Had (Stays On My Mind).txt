Lately babe, I've been thinking
How good it was when you were here
And it ain't the wine that I've been drinking
For once I feel my head is clear

Early this morning
When I opened my eyes (Opened my eyes)
That old lonesome feeling
Took me by surprise
I guess you meant more
Than I realised

(The love we had stays on my mind)
Oh, the love we had, the love we had
(The love we had stays on my mind)
Stays on my mind

And boy, I've been remembering
The good times that we used to share
My thoughts of you don't have an ending
And memories of you are everywhere

But why should I tell you?
It's not your concern (It's not your concern)
You win some, you lose some
Well, I've lost and I've learned (I've lost and I've learned)
It's just that I'm so lonely
With no place to turn
And here at the end I find

The love that we had
Stays right on my mind

(And if you were nearer)
Oh, yes, it does
(If you had a mirror)
You stay on my mind, yeah
(Maybe you could count my tears)
Oh, oh
And if you were nearer
It would all be clearer
How I wish that you were here
How I wish that you were here
How I wish that you were here
Oh, oh-oh
Oh
Hmm-mm, mm
And baby boy, I was just so tired (Just so tired)
So I lay down to dream a while
And lately I've been so uninspired
Without the comfort of your smile

But I'm not complaining
'Cause that's just how it goes (That's just how it goes)
There's always some heartache
In this world, I suppose (I suppose)
But you can't imagine
And nobody knows

The love we had stays on my mind, ooh
The love we had stays on my mind
The love we had stays on my mind, ooh
