Mhm, mm
Yeah, yeah, uh

Nothing in this world
Got me like you do, baby
I'd give up my soul
If I couldn't sing with you daily
I'm not the only girl
In love with you, it's crazy
I appreciate your groove
Now I know I owe everything to you

Music
I'm so in love with my music
The way you keepin' me movin'
Ain't nobody do what you're doin', doin'
So bring me back to the day when tape decks press play
DJ, drop the needle till the record just break
You are my sunlight, you are the one mic
That sounds so sweet 'cause the beat just inspires me, oh

No limit to your mind
Your endless love is open
To every race and kind
Could it be your blood runs golden?
Baby, if this world were mine (Oh, if)
We'd be singing in the key of life (Oh)
When you're gone, I can't survive
'Cause I just can't be without my

Colors of sound, scales of beauty, audio scenery
Electric love and rhythmic symmetry written in memory
Beautifully crafted scenery, complex or simplicity
Sonic energy, piercing insensitivity
Sympathetic poetry, for some, even identity
Collective entity, something to belong to, a source of energy
The possibilities, wavelengths and bandwidth
Higher vibration, energizing entire lands
With something to stand with or stand for
Lovers to walk hand and hand with, then plan for
Sanctuary chords, harmonies, melodies
Even riffs can be disguised human essence
Sonically bottled ecstasy or melancholy
Agony, blues, angst, exercising anxieties
Fueling entire societies, making economies
Stimulating, generating inspiration synonymously
Entertaining expression, intangible, invisible but undeniable
Plays the language of excitement on surv-i-val
Some call it tr-i-bal, but perspective is everything
Connected to everything, some say collectively everything
