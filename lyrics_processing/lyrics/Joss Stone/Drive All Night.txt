Oh, yeah
Here we go

Just when I thought I put you off
Silly, old me, I called too many times
Thought you were about to mug me up
Here I am, getting all messed up
My fucking fire sign

Then you drive all night
Sayin', "What use is the night?" when you can't sleep anyway
You might be tired (Tired)
But the fact of the matter is you're standing right in front of my face
You saved me
Saved me from hate, it's so close to love
No one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before

I started to worry, do I smell nice?
Like a fool I left my, my gum on the side
And then I go and kiss you
And the follow up from that was a whole bunch of nothing
Wondering where you're at

But then you drive all night
Sayin', "What use is the night?" when you can't sleep anyway
You might be tired (Tired)
But the fact of the matter is you're standing right in front of my face
You saved me
Saved me from hate, it's so close to love
No one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before (Nobody)
No one's ever done anything like this for me before (Nobody, love)
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before

I'm happy I was wrong, at least I can sing a love song (No, no)
There's no reason to believe in life outside the bitter rain (No, no)
I'm glad that I was wrong, baby
I can sing it with heart, I can sing it with feeling

And then you drive all night
Sayin', "What use is the night?" when you can't sleep anyway
You might be tired
But the fact of the matter is you're standing right in front of my face
You saved me
And no one's ever done anything like this for me before, no
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before (Nobody, baby)
Then you drive all night
"What use is the night?" but you can't sleep anyway
You might be tired
But now you're standing right in front of my face
And you saved me
You saved me from hate and it's so close to love
No one, baby
Said, no one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile

Tell me this, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Oh, yeah, ba-du-uh, la-da-da
Ah-ah, yeah
La-da-da, yeah
You drive all night

And then you drive all night
Sayin', "What use is the night?" when you can't sleep anyway
You might be tired
But the fact of the matter is you're standing right in front of my face
You saved me
Saved me from hate, it's so close to love
No one's ever done anything like this for me before, baby
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before
Hmm, yeah
