Now this one is designed for eighteen and over, over
Eighteen and over, over
You must be eighteen and over
Boy, won't you go home?
Go home to your mama, your mama
Go home to your papa, your papa
You're too young to be my lover

You got to be careful in this time
Know your role and try learn your line
Inna this-a time you cannot move like you're blind
Nobody move 'cause you will get left behind

I understand you'd like to smoke my shisha, my shisha
But really, where is your weed at, weed at?
Tell me you're not a joka smoka

A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with weed is better
If you wanna get high, bring your own supply
I didn't know you was a joka smoka

Know your role and try learn your line
Inna this-a time you cannot move like you're blind
Nobody move 'cause you will get left behind
You got to be careful in this time
Know your role and try learn your line
Inna this-a time you cannot move like you're blind
Nobody will stand 'cause you will get left behind

I need you to come, Rosie, tell him to come
He said he didn't have a daughter, but he did have a son
Said the lift doesn't work, run up the stairs to come
If you don't come quick, you're not gonna see your son
So he grabbed a bunch of roses and he started to run
Here I come
Skippity-bop, bop, bop, Skippity-whoa-oh-oh
Here I come, here I go
Skippity-bop, bop, bop, Skippity-whoa-oh-oh
Swing, oh, oh

Shock, black, double down-beat bouncin'
Rock-wize, tumble doun sound music
Foot drop, find drum, blood story
Bass his'try is a-movin' is a-hurtin' black story, hurtin' black story
Thunder from a bass drum soundin'
Lightnin' from a trumpet and a organ
Bass and rythm and trumpet double up
Team up with drums for a deep doun searchin', deep doun searchin'
Bad boy, bad boy
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when they come for you?
Bad boy, bad boy
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when they come for you?

Now excuse me while I light my spliff
Make stop, move forward

You got to be careful in this time
Know your role and try learn your line
Inna this-a time you cannot move like you're blind
Nobody move 'cause you will get left behind
You got to be careful in this time
Know your role and try learn your line
Inna this-a time you cannot move like you're blind
Nobody will stand 'cause you will get left behind

Dig doun to de root of pain
Shape it into violence for de people
They will know what to do, they will do it
Shock, black, double down-beat bouncin'
Rock-wize, tumble doun sound music
Foot drop, find drum, blood story
