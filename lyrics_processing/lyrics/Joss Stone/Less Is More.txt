Don't go sending me those three-dozen roses
Don't you know that just one rose will do?
Don't go tryin' to put diamonds on my fingers
Don't you know that I'm making money too?
Don't go throwing those stones outside my window
You don't gotta be calling three times a day
'Cause if you do, then, when we get together
I'll be biting my lip 'cause there's nothin' else left to say

Haven't you heard absence makes a heart grow fonder? (Grow fonder)
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight? No
I'm telling you straight, baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowdin' me out, it's not right

Less is more
Back it up, slow it down, let it breathe
'Cause too much of a good thing can be bad
See, we don't wanna go out like that
Less is more
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
If you want me to still be around
Remember

If you wanna be showing your affection (Ooh)
Don't you know a simple kiss will do? (Just one kiss)
So many beautiful ways for love's expression, yeah
But I'm sorry to say your way ain't getting through (Ooh)

Haven't you heard a little space makes a heart grow fonder? (Grow fonder)
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight? No
I'm telling you straight, baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowdin' me out, it's not right

Less is more
Back it up, slow it down, let it breathe
'Cause too much of a good thing can be bad
See, we don't wanna go out like that
Less is more
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
If you want me to still be around
Remember, yeah

It would be something if I had a chance to be missing you (Missing you)
Too much for taking, it's driving me crazy, that's all you do (All you do)
It needs rearranging, it's so suffocating that I can't move
You gotta take two steps back, believe what they say, it's true (Less is, less is)
Less is more
Back it up, slow it down, let it breathe (Let it breathe)
'Cause too much of a good thing can be bad (Too much of a good thing)
Be so bad (Go like that)
Less is more
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
If you want me to still be around
Remember (Remember)

Give me a chance to miss you
Boy, I don't mean to diss you, but
I tell you I need some space
And still you call me up three times a day
You know
Baby, you're crowdin' me out
Haven't you heard? Less is more
Oh (Less is more)
(Less is, less is)
Less is more, uh
You listening, boy?
Less is more (La-la, la-la, la, la-la)
