Oh, ah

Yeah
La, la, la, la

Well

Well, it's a shame
We used to be so tight
Tell me, what's your game
Since you left me outside?
I'm gonna change my track
Go anywhere but back
Ooh, ooh, when I think about it
I'm better off without it

There's no gain, only pain
And my heart can't take the strain
I can't sit on the shelf
I'll give my love to someone else

If you see me walking by
Hand in hand with another guy
Know that it's true (Ooh, ooh)
It coulda been you (Ooh, ooh)
If you'd only treated me right
Not out of sight, baby, out of mind
That's what you do (Ooh, ooh)
It coulda been you (Ooh, ooh)

Ooh
Yeah
Ooh

Don't wanna wait
For what you promised me
Like a train delayed
Forever, so it seems
I'm gonna change my track
Go anywhere but back
Ooh, ooh, when I think about it
I'm better off without it

There's no gain, only pain
And my heart can't take the strain
I can't sit on the shelf
I'll give my love to someone else

Hand in hand with another guy
Know that it's true (Ooh, ooh)
It coulda been you (Ooh, ooh)
If you'd only treated me right
Not out of sight, baby, out of mind
That's what you do (Ooh, ooh)
It coulda been you (Ooh, ooh)

You could have been my first, my last forever
You held it in your hands, my heart, my treasure
The proof is in the memories
So sad to know that's all that's left for you
Is what could have been
Oh (Hey)

(But it's a shame)
If you see me walking by (We used to be so tight)
Hand in hand with another guy (Tell me, what is your game?)
Know that it's true (Oh, baby)
It coulda been you (See, it coulda been you, yeah)
If you'd only treated me right
Not out of sight, baby, out of mind

It coulda been you, yeah, oh
If you see me walking by
Hand in hand with another guy
Know that it's true, yeah (Ooh, ooh)

Hand in hand with another guy
Know that it's true (Know that it's true, baby)
It coulda been you (Know that it's true, it coulda been, it coulda been)
If you'd only treated me right (It coulda been you)
Not of sight, baby, out of mind (Oh)
That's what you do (But it wasn't, baby)
It coulda been you (Never was gonna be anyway)
If you see me walking by
Hand in hand with another guy (I wish you never messed it up)
Know that it's true (How you gonna mess it up?)
It coulda been you
If you'd only treated me right (Baby, if you'd only)
Not out of sight, baby, out of mind (Ooh, yeah)
That's what you do (Ooh, ooh)
It coulda been you (Ooh, ooh)

Some say that it shoulda been
