'Til we meet again, hold on
'Til we speak again, kee-eep strong
The world don't need to know what's going on
Keep it under your hat 'til we meet again
The kiss you left on my bed side light
The words you whispered made me feel right
The clues you scattered on the porch that night
Is all so-o-o-o

You're my special lover man (Special lover man)
Always undercover man (Undercover man)
See, now this I can't stand (I can't stand it, stand it)
We got our private plans, oh
You're my precious other man (Precious other man)
And I know I'll never land (Know I'll never land)
Another like you, ooh (I can't stand it, stand it)
My secret lover man

He's my man, my heart, my buffalo soldier (Ooh-ooh)
From where I'm standin', there is no turnin' back

I don't want no double time opinion
Mine's efficient enough, I'm with him, stop
Just stop

I hear the chirpin' of the choir in the back (Ooh-ooh)
Made up of minds that don't wanna get to know you (Ooh-ooh)
They get to chattin' up all kinda trash
Not much is happenin' in their lives, they just get older
They only give me their time with a problem
That don't feel good to my soul so I give them not
Uh-huh
