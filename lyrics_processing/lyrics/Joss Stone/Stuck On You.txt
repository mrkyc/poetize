The deeper I fall, the tighter you hold on
The more that you know, the less love you show to me
The door that you closed, it just won't open
I don't wanna let go, but it's taken its toll on me
I don't like that you don't like my mind, it ain't changing
I can't care if you're here or there, it's alright, I'm just saving
My heart, 'cause leaving it with you ain't smart
See, the deeper I fall, the faster you run away

Every time we talk (Every time we talk, I...)
(I find I'm falling into you, I...)
I get stuck on loving you
(Feel I'm stuck on you, stuck on you, babe)
Every time I fall (Every time I fall, I...)
(I fall right into you, I, I...)
I land in loving you
(I'm landing in your love, babe, in your love, babe)
What will I do with you?
What will I do with you?

I've been pushed to a crawl, I wish I could walk away
But there's something about you, maybe it's everything
That draws me in and makes me wanna need you
Need to want you, makes me wanna stay
But the deeper I fall, the faster you run away

I fall
(What will I do with you?)
I just can't get enough

Every time you get me close enough, I fall for you
It's everything you do, I just can't get enough
You got me truly, got me truly...
Every time you get me close enough, I fall for you
It's everything you do, I just can't get enough
You got me truly, got me truly...
Every time you get me close enough, I fall for you
It's everything you do, I just can't get enough
