Welcome to...

Welcome to the underworld
Where the love's oversized
The kind that we like
Under, under, under, underworld

Roll in this feeling, it's herb related
Let your eyes be your mind elated
This is a room where your ego can't fake it
So go ahead, let your hair fall down
Though the world's overpopulated
You can feel free, it's love we're making
You'd be a fool to refuse to take it
So don't be shy, come inside

Welcome to the underworld
Where the love's oversized
The kind that we like
Under, under, under, underworld
Welcome to the underworld
Where the people stay high
All of their lives
Underworld (Under, under, under, underworld)
Hmm
See Joss Stone LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like
It's a beauteous understatement
Like the sun shinin' through the rain's hands
Sounds never complicated
Just don't think too tough, that's enough (Just feel)
Listen to the echo of a smile that saved me
Walk the shortest of miles to crazy
Let the note that you wrote
Lay me down, sow your seeds good now
A stitch that allows us to move
Inside and out, all around each other's groove

Underworld
Where the love's oversized
The kind that we like
Under, under, under, underworld
Welcome to the underworld
Where the people stay high
All of their lives
Underworld (Under, under, under, underworld)
Underworld

I wanna see what you want when you feel free
I can imagine it'd be much more than a turn of the table
So you can be able to feel the heat of the heavy beat
Let go, let go, leave those cuff links on the street
It's an itch you got to scratch, yes, burn your mail, mail
Bishaboshabash, no kinda world can tell your tale
No height you got to match so you can stay or you can bail
I throw a light, I hope you catch, hope you catch
We'll dim the bright so you relax, you relax
I wanna see what you look like when you leave, who will you be?
Will you feel lovely as you smoke the breeze bought to you by the trees?
Mother Nature's leaves
Welcome to the underworld
Where the love's oversized
The kind that we like
Under, under, under, underworld
Welcome to the underworld
Where the people stay high
All of their lives
The underworld (Under, under, under, underworld)
Underworld, yeah
