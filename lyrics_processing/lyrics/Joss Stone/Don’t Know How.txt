You caught my eye
And out of nowhere, you appeared by surprise
And it's not like me, but, certainly, I
I heard myself calling for you, you (Uh)
Could it be fate?
I'm feelin' butterflies and I can't escape
And it's like a rush that's coming over me
The sight of you just takes me away, yeah (Mm)

Boy, you're so fine
And I wanna tell you so
I'm much too shy
Wanna make you mine (Mm)
But I don't know how
How

Got so much time
Your attitude, everything, you make me smile
Think I'm falling in deep for no reason why
I can't help myself, yeah, yeah
Friends think I'm wrong
For being head over heels, I should be strong
Should I say it and deal with it?
Or should I just let go? Ooh, no, oh
