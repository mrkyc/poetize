Mm-hmm, mm-mm

I can't help it
Every conversation that I have
It's got me trapped
We're right back to where we started, why?
I can't stand it
I'm tryna get away from loving you
But there's no use
'Cause nothing that I ever seem to do is right

Right now I feel
I should do what's best for me (Ooh)
Even if it hurts so much
They got their , so what?

Every time I turn around
These people always talkin' 'bout
They don't understand what they don't know
I wish they'd all leave me alone
Every time I turn around
Boy, there's always something 'bout cha
It's gettin' way out of my control
And I don't want to be like this no more
No more

I wish I had a dime
For every time you lied to me
I tried to leave
But something inside's pulling me, yeah
And I don't like goodbyes
But could it be it's just the irony?
That someone I love so much
Just is right for me

Every time I turn around
These people always talkin' 'bout
They don't understand what they don't know
I wish they'd all leave me alone
Every time I turn around

It's gettin' way out of my control
And I don't want to be like this no more

Then being without you, I just can't let go

Every time I turn around
People always talkin' 'bout
