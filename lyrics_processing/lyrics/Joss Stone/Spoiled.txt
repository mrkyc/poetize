I kinda thought that I'd be better off by myself
I've never been so wrong before
You made it impossible for me to ever love somebody else
And now I don't know what I left you for

See, I thought that I could replace you
He can't love me the way you do
Till now, I never knew, baby

I'm spoiled
By your love, boy
No matter how I try to change my mind
What's the point? It's just a waste of time
I'm spoiled
By your touch, boy
The love you give is just too hard to find
Don't wanna live without you in my life
I'm spoiled

Oh, oh, oh (Mm)
Oh, oh, oh

I tried to tell myself that I'd be over you in a week or two
But, baby, that was 'bout a year ago
I've never seen the word "love" so personified as I do with you
And that is why I, I just can't let go, no

I'm spoiled
By your love, boy (Ooh, no)
No matter how I try to change my mind
What's the point? It's just a waste of time
I'm spoiled
By your touch, boy
The love you give is just too hard to find
Don't wanna live without you in my life
I'm spoiled

Oh, oh, oh (Spoiled me)
Oh, oh, oh (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

And I would only be fooling myself
If I tried to believe there's room for someone else in my heart
There ain't no way I'm getting over you
I don't know what I've been tryin' to prove
I'm hopeless, helpless
When it comes to you, you, you
I'm spoiled
By your love, boy (I'm spoiled, oh, yeah, yeah, no)
No matter how I try to change my mind (Hmm)
What's the point? It's just a waste of time (What's the point, babe?)
I'm spoiled (I feel spoiled)
By your touch, boy (Ooh)
The love you give is just too hard to find (Too hard to find)
Don't wanna live without you in my life (Too hard to find)
I'm spoiled

Oh, oh, oh (Ooh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (I've been spoiled, ooh, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh (Mm)
