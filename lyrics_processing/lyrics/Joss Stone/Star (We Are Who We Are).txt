Give me strength, don't give me grief
I don't wanna break or mend your beliefs
I wanna hear ya, hear ya, and keep my mind free
I'm not gonna judge ya, I hope you don't judge me
Tell me, do you feel an angel somehow has given you the right
To advise the world and his wife how to live their lives?
Whoever you may be, whatever walk of life
It's you who hold your light
It's up to you whether you hide it or let it shine

We are who we are, love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone?
We are who we are, love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone?

Speak a solution, you can keep your problems
I hear your opinion, and yes, we've all, yes, we've all got 'em
Somebody's trash is somebody's treasure
Somebody's laugh is somebody's pain
Somebody's loss is somebody's gain
It don't matter what car you drive or whatever sound you like
It don't matter if you're praying to God or trusting mother nature's strife
What's true to you and I maybe won't be right for another kind of life
Can't we agree to disagree? And we can be happy

We are who we are, love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone?
We are who we are

We should be able to say what we think
And make love at the end of the day
We should be able to step out and sing
And fall back in our own kind of way
It's okay if you don't wanna see
It's okay if you disagree
So reach inside of yourself
And realize that you're one of a kind
And all that you are is just fine
Know that you're you and I'm me
Free to fly, free to fall
Free to learn, love and lie
It's up to you to live
If you don't know what to do with yourself, just breathe
