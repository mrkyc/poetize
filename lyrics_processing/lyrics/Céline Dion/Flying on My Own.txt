There's something shifting in the air
If I'm not mistaken
The dust is clearing everywhere
Memories awaken

My feet on the runway
It's a beautiful day
I look to the sky now
I'm finding my way

I'm flying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm flying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)
I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)

The warmer winds will carry me
Anywhere I want them to
If you could see what I can see
That nothing's blockin' my view
You might also like
I look to the sky now
It's a beautiful day

I'm flying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm flying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)
I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)

I'm free like an eagle, soar like an eagle
Sailing the winds of change
On the winds of change
On the winds of change

My feet on the runway
It's a beautiful day
I look to the sky now
I'm finding my way

I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)
I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)
I'm flying on my, flying on my, flying on my own
Flying on my own, baby, yeah, yeah (On the wings of your love)
I'm flying on my, flying on my, flying on my own
Flying on my own, baby, yeah, yeah (On the wings of your love)
Flying on my own (On the wings of your love)
On the winds of change
(On the winds of change)
(On the winds of change)
