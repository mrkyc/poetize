I don't want to wait too long
Wait too long, so what do I do?
I don't want to take this time
To look inside, it hurts when I do
I don't want to feel this pain
Feel this pain, it burns my eyes to
Crying is the only thing that gets me through
Besides calling for you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Calling for you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Calling for you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Calling for you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Besides calling for you

Oh, baby, yeah-yeah, ayy-ayy (Ayy-ayy)
Oh, baby, yeah-yeah, ayy-ayy (Ayy-ayy)
Oh, baby, yeah-yeah, ayy-ayy (Ayy-ayy)
Come to me (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Come to me (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)

I don't want to think too much
Think too much, but that's what I do
I'm missing you is all I know
When you were close, I felt every move
Now I don't want to feel this pain
I stay up late and fall right into
Crying is the only thing that gets me through
Besides calling for you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Calling for you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Calling for you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Calling for you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Besides calling for you
