Always making more of what really happened
Critical imagination always working over time
Maybe this is what the world will see
A tiny little version of the tallest tree
An optical illusion of the human mind
Posing as a real life
I never have my mind made up
Before the bomb dropped
And if i ever do decided to take a chance
Oh, the part that keeps me holding on
It'll be my mind
Awaken my mind
Awaken my mind
Open my eyes
Free my mind
Awaken my mind
Awaken my mind
Open my eyes
We like to watch the world go by
Paint pretty picture with the perfect light
Build a happy home to live inside
Work until the sunrise
You might also likeBut I have such a dream to keep
To spend another day counting sheep
Seven in a row will make a week
Enough to disappoint you
I never have my mind made up
Before the bomb dropped
And if i ever do decided to take a chance
Oh, the part that keeps me holding on
It'll be my mind
Awaken my mind
Awaken my mind
Open my eyes
Free my mind
Awaken my mind
Awaken my mind
Open my eyes
Never had my mind made up
No, I Never had my mind made up
No, No, never had my mind made up
Never had my mind made up
Never had my mind made
Never had my mind made up
No, I Never had my mind made up
Oh no, Never had my mind made up
Never had my mind made up
Never had my mind made
It'll be my mind
Awaken my mind
Awaken my mind
Open my eyes
Free my mind
Awaken my mind
Awaken my mind
Open my eyes
Free my mind
Awaken my mind
Awaken my mind
Open my eyes
Free my mind

Awaken my mind
