How do you talk about a feeling
When you don't know where where it lives inside
How do you talk about a doubt that's like a shadow-
Chasing away the light?

We want the same thing when we're happy
We want the same thing when we're sad
We are not breaking we're just one step away from
All we ever dreamed we'd have

You used to doubt that you would ever find a real love
Before you knew what it was
I used to think that I knew everything about it
But it was not good enough

We want the same thing when we're happy
We want the same thing when we're sad
We are not breaking we're just one step away from
All we ever dreamed we'd have
All we ever
All we ever
Dreamed we'd have
You might also like
It's hard to make it
Until we tear it all down
It's hard to fake it
Until we tear it all down
Hard to make it
Until we tear it all down

We want the same thing when we're happy
We want the same thing when we're sad
We are not breaking we're just one step away from
All we ever dreamed we'd have

We want the same thing when we're happy
(It's hard to make it-Until we, until we tear it all down)
We want the same thing when we're sad
We are not breaking we're just one step away from
(It's hard to make it--Until we tear it all down)
All we ever dreamed we'd have
We want the same thing when we're happy
(It's hard to make it-Until we, until we tear it all down)
We want the same thing when we're sad
We are not breaking we're just one step away from
(It's hard to make it--Until we tear it all down)
