Bust Bust nigga what's whats
That's the word word. Middle finger to these herb herbs
Mic check 1,2, 1,2 check. Mic check 1,2 1,2 check
Mic check, check it

Let me elaborate, I'm moving at a faster rate
And making moves continuously while yo' bitch ass just hate
Don't worry bout' the cash I make, that don't really concern you
Instead I'm progressing writing lyrics for you to burn to
Lyrically I'll burn you like a stove in the kitchen
I flow with precision, a young nigga with global envision
More wisdom than my competition, thinking till' my mind is missing
Rocking a tee and jeans because I got no time for the finest linen
I am winning in the game, that sucks if your losing
I ain't saying I'm blowing up but I'm sure moving
Last summer I was chilling on a tour cruising
And said Don't Sleep for them dick riders and whores snoozing
Had to wake em' up, you mother fucking hating chumps
I'm on my grind and caking up, most of y'all are fake as fuck
I keep it a buck, I don't need a witness, you get this
I'm all about my business, money over bitches
But don't get it twisted, I love my pretty women
With some class and an ass rocking jeans with fetty denim
Let sketchy get em, killing these hoes, I'm killing these flows
It's okay because they feeling me though
On the real I really feel that I'm too real to be known
Cause' I been spitting since an infinite and I'm still in the zone
Tell Jay-Z I'm stealing the thrown, the easiest way
Cause' me and rap go together just like P,B and J
Got a problem we can solve em come see me today
And I ain't talking bout' Jay, I mean anybody
I'm not a goon but my tunes be giving out plenty bodies
Like blow blow, nigga blow blow haha
You might also likeNiggas be gassed, thinking they the shit when you not
Haven't you noticed people only on your dick when you hot
And when you fall off, it turns all off just like a light switch
Just like this, unrighteous, so get it right bitch
And when you back on, people start to second guess
Giving you another chance and acting like you never left
My haters even said, "your new shit's way fresher sketch, put me on!"
That's the kind of shit that gets me mega stressed
Same people said I'd never make it, mega hating
Now I'm fucking the game so raw I'm penetrating

Like bitch! It's Get Cree till' I mother fucking die
You already knew that though, I guess we outta here
