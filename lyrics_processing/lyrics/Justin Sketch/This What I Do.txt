Yup. It's J.Sketch homie. Shout out Dante CK on the beat though
He made this shit for me. It's fresh as fuck. You know?

I Be dropping heat cause' that's just doing what I do
And I be dropping frees cause' that's just what I do
I be toking trees cause' that's just doing what I do
And I be roasting beats cause' that's just what I do
I be on my grind cause' that's just doing what I do
I'm getting what's mine cause' that's just what I do
I be chasing paper I'm just doing what I do
Mother fuck all you haters this what I do!

I came in the game and I'm ripping it down
While you sat around I was fixing my sound
And Every time that I spit in the crowd
They all going crazy and flipping it out
You can see I'm on a different route
Then most people on this planet
Understand it damn it, this is my destiny I didn't plan it
I'm just doing what I do, this is me
You flaking bitches be
Upset cause in result of being myself I'm making history
As a kid you see was grinding, never hypnotized by child stars
They told you go fish and you listen, Me I played the wildcard
You need to hear how hard, my freestyles are
I'll hit you up with three wild bars, then see smiles large
Because an underground star's how the treat me
They Always be repping the team and screaming Get Cree whenever they meet me
Dapping me up when they greet me

I got more bars than a penitentiary, rapping a tenth of a century
When I was only like nine, I started to rhyme so elementary
I knew that all of along, that making these songs that it was meant for me
Now that I'm shining like treasury, everything's complimentary
And I don't gotta pay a dime
But I wrote yo' chick a ticket cause' whenever I spit it, she always say I'm fine
She be like-

Say a line of some shit you wrote
Or please just freestyle cause either way your shits too dope

So then I told her fly with me as we float like a new boat
And we can make decisions together we'll have a group vote
When you spoke, you choked relax no need to be nervous girl
I know that I'm underground right now, but I'm coming up to the surface world


Yeah! Shout out my nigga Dante CK on the beat though
Man you knew I would kill this shit
Haha, shout out all my Masons repping
They be repping that Cree
We worldwide this time around though. Yup
