Now I'm about to give you my heart
But remember this one thing
I've never been in love before
So you gotta go easy on me

I heard love is dangerous
Once you fall you never get enough
But the thought of you leaving
Ain't so easy for me

Don't hurt me (Eh)
Desert me (Hmm)
Don't give up on me
What would I wanna do that for?
Don't use me
Take advantage of me
Make me sorry I ever counted on you

1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you

Understand I've been here before
Thought I found someone I finally could adore
But you failed my test
Got to know her better
Saw I wasn't the only one
But, I'm willing to put my trust in you
Baby you can put your trust in me

Just like you count to 3
You can count on me
And you're never gonna see
No numbers in my pocket (No)
Anything I'm doing, girl
I'll drop it for you
Cause you're the one I'm giving my heart to but I gotta be the only one

Don't hurt me
Desert me
Don't give up on me
What would I wanna do that for?
Don't use me
Take advantage of me
Make me sorry I ever counted on you
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you

I really hope you understand
That if you wanna take my hand
You should put yours over my heart
I promise to be careful from the start
I'm trusting you with loving me
(Very very carefully)
Never been so vulnerable
Baby I'll make you comfortable

1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5 (yeah), baby, I'm counting on you (Ohh)
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5 (why would I want to do that, hey, yeah)
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5 (Oh, whoa), baby, I'm counting on you
1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5

Now I'm about to give you my heart
So remember this one thing
I've never been in love before
