I know you're ready to go
I'm-I'm ready to go
Jaw drop, heart stop, we eye lock
I must be dreaming, don't hit the alarm clock
Under the lights, coming alive
She "thriller" tonight (Ay-ay-ay)
One dance, two dance is not enough
You got that glow on the dark, so I'm not giving up (woah)
I'm reading your mind, you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it, hide it?
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go (go)
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me (ooh)
Don't leave me out on the floor (floor)
I'm saying whoa
Don't tell me no (woah-oh-oh-oh)
Love me, love me, say you're gonna love me
I'm-I'm, I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Love me, love me, lo-love me, lo-love me
Love me, love me, lo-love me
I'm-I'm ready to go
