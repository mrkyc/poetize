Hey yeah
Yeah, yeah

When everyday feels like the other
And everywhere looks just the same
When every dream seems like forever
And you're a face without a name

Maybe now is our best chance
To finally get it right
Cause if the world is an apple
Then it's time to take a bite

Someday it'll come together
Someday we will work it out
I know, we can turn it up all the way
Cause this is our someday
Someday is what we make it
Someday is right here and now
Why wait, why wait, why wait?
Cause this is our someday

We all have times
Time we wonder
Will the spotlight shine on me?
Don't let waves go and pull us under
We'll miss the opportunity
Don't look down or look back
It's not that far to go
Cause if we never trap it
We will never really know

Someday it'll come together
Someday we will work it out
I know, we can turn it up all the way
Cause this is our someday
Someday is what we make it
Someday is right here and now
Why wait, why wait, why wait?
Cause this is our someday
Oh, no
I don't have all the answers
If there is one thing
I know for sure
One is good
But four is better
It took some time to get here
But it's better late than never!

Someday it'll come together
Someday we will work it out
I know, we can turn it up all the way
Cause this is our someday
Someday is what we make it
Someday is right here and now
Why wait, why wait, why wait?
Cause this is our someday

Someday it'll come together
Someday we will work it out
I know, we can turn it up all the way
Cause this is our someday
Someday is what we make it
Someday is right here and now
Why wait, why wait, why wait?
