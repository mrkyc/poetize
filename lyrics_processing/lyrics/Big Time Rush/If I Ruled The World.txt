Ya know it's your boy, I-Y-A-Z
And Big Time Rush, woo

If I ruled the world, I'd throw all my money in the air like confetti
If I ruled the world, every house got a DJ and a backyard party
And I break all the borders down
When I shake the ground

If I ruled the world, I'd dream out loud

So everybody get up (up), up (up) outta your seats
Kick off your shoes like you're down at the beach
An' jump up (up), up (up), up on the beat
Singing ayo, ayo, ayo
Up (up), up (up), outta your seats
Be who you are love is all you need
All of us geeks, freaks, and wannabes
Singing ayo
If I ruled the world
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you

If you were my girl
You'd never have to worry about another thing, no
'Cause I'd rule the world
And you'd be right next to me, running the show
We'd throw every rule in the book out and bring down the house

If you were my girl
We'd dream out loud

So everybody get up (up), up (up) outta your seats
Kick off your shoes like you're down at the beach
Jump up (up), up (up), up on the beat
Singing ayo, ayo, ayo
Up (up), up (up), outta your seats
Be who you are love is all you need
All of us geeks, freaks, and wannabes
Singing ayo
If I ruled the world
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you
I'd be beating on my chest, I'm the king of the hill
Iyaz and Big Time Rush keeping it real
Magic carpets, girl, we go wherever
I ain't tryna run game, I ain't tryna be clever (ooh, yeah)
Girl, I'ma be the king and you will be the queen
Going a hundred miles an hour, girl we runnin' the streets
And if the cops ever try and pull us over
We'd tell 'em "Hey, Mister Officer, we own ya"

Hey ayo, if I ruled the world
Here we go here we go

So everybody get up (up), up (up) outta your seats
Kick off your shoes like you're down at the beach
Jump up (up), up (up), up on the beat
Singing ayo, ayo, ayo
