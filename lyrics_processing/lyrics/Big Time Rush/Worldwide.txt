Uh, oh, oh

Wait (Wait), a minute (Wait)
Before you tell me anything, how was your day?
Cause I (Wait) been missing you by my side, yeah
Did I (Wait) awake (Wait) you out of your dreams?
I'm sorry but I couldn't sleep
You calm me down
There's something 'bout the sound of your voice

I-I-I-I'm never, never
Never as far away as it may seem, oh
Soon we'll be together
We'll pick up right where we left off

Paris, London, Tokyo; it's just one thing that I gotta do
(Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone
Hello, tuck you in every night)
And I can hardly take another goodbye, baby, won't be long
You're the one that I'm waiting on
(Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone, woah)
