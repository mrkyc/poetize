Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah-eh!)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah-eh!)

So tell me who am I supposed to be?
What I gotta do to get you close to me?
If I run away tonight will you follow me?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon (Oh, yeah)
I see you standing there all alone (All alone)
Knowing you've been wanting me to say "hello"
'Cause when the lights go flashing everybody to know
It's on, it's on, it's on (Hey!)

Say anything you want, I turn the music up
'Cause baby we ain't going no-o-o-where
I'll leave it all behind to be with you tonight
And everybody's screaming: "Oh-oh-oh-oh"

Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah-eh!)
Screaming: "Oh yeah! (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah-eh!)"
Screaming: "Oh yeah! (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah-eh!)"
Screaming: "Oh yeah, yeah"

We could be together if you only knew (Only knew)
Cause life's too short, we got nothing to lose

And I ain't gonna stop until I make you mine (Make you mine)
I just gotta make it to you by the end of the night

Say anything you want, I turn the music up
'Cause baby we ain't going no-o-o-where
