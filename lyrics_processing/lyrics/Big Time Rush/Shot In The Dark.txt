I promised I would be there, I swear I'm on my way
I know you may not hear me, but that's the price I'll pay
I've taken you for granted, you're the air I breathe
I gave you everything, but It was everything but me

I don't know how I would ever go all alone
Walking on my own
Like angels, you were floating to me
And that's how it should be

Cause I don't wanna waste another moment
I don't wanna pay for things unspoken
I just wanna race with arms wide open
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are
I don't wanna watch the world keep changing
When I'm not with you my heart keeps shaking
Cover up my eyes and just stop pacing
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are
Take a shot in the dark

I promised you I'd reach you
I swear I'm almost there
As the road was disappearing
You made it all so clear

I don't know how I would ever go all alone
Walking on my own
Like angels, you were floating to me
And that's how it should be

Cause I don't wanna waste another moment (Waste another moment)
I don't wanna pay for things unspoken
I just wanna race with arms wide open
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are
I don't wanna watch the world keep changing (Watch the world keep changing)
When I'm not with you my heart keeps shaking
Cover up my eyes and just stop pacing
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are
Take a shot in the dark

I promise you I'm gonna be there
I wanna be there
No matter what happens
No matter how tragic
Because the clock is ticking
The world is spinning
Our lives are passing us by
Cause I don't wanna waste another moment
I don't wanna pay for things unspoken
I just wanna race with arms wide open
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are
I don't wanna watch the world keep changing
When I'm not with you my heart keeps shaking
Cover up my eyes and just stop pacing
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are
