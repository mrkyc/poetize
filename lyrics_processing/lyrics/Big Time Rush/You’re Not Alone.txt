I bet you didn't notice
First time your heart was broken
You called me up and we talked til the morning (Oh)
And the time that you were stranded
I was there before you landed
He was a no show, I made sure you got home

I've been right there (right there)
For every minute
This time, it's no different
Whatever happens you should know (whoa)

Cause you're not alone, girl
Look over your shoulder
You don't have to wonder
Cause you know, you know, you know
You're not alone, girl
I'll be there to hold you
I'll stay til it's over
And you know, you know, you know

That you're not alone (You, you, you)
That you're not alone (You, you, you)
(You're not alone)
