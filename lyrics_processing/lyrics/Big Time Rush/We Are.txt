Thinking, we don't wanna get caught up in over thinking
We only got tonight
Moments, we gotta keep on living for these moments
Cause this is our time

Life's too short to sit and wait
For luck to come our way
Light it up like fireworks
I wanna hear you say

We are, we are
We are alive
And we are the light that's shining now
We are, we are
We are the reckless
And you can hear us drowning out the sound
We are, we are
Young and dumb, always chasing something
We are, we are
Hearts like drums, you can hear us coming
We are, we are

Chances, you know there's nothing wrong with taking chances
We put it on the line
Oh someday, I know we're gonna be somebody's someday
Only gotta try
