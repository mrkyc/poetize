You, you walked into the room
On a Friday afternoon
That's when I saw you for the first time
And I was paralyzed
I had a million things to say
But none of them came out that day
'Cause I was never one of those guys
That always had the best lies

Time stopped tickin'
My hands keep shaking
And you don't even know that

I try to speak, but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Can't even talk, cause words don't come into my mind
I'd make a move if I had the guts to
But I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

Now I learned a lot from my mistake
Never let a good thing slip away
I've had a lot of time to look back
And my only regret is

Not telling you what I was going through
You didn't even know that

I try to speak, but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Can't even talk, cause words don't come into my mind
I'd make a move if I had the guts to
But I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

As the years go by I think about you all the time (whoa-oh)
If I get the chance I hope I won't be paralyzed, paralyzed by you

You walked into the room
On a Friday afternoon

I try to speak, but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed (you got me paralyzed)
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Can't even talk, cause words don't come into my mind
I'd make a move if I had the guts to
But I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed (you got me paralyzed)
Paralyzed, paralyzed (you got me tongue-tied)
Paralyzed, paralyzed (now I'm frozen inside)
Paralyzed, paralyzed
