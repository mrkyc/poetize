Here I am there you are, why does it seem so far?
Next to you is where I should be (Where I wanna be)
Something I want so bad, know what's inside your head
Maybe I could see what you see (Tell me what you see)

I gotta keep on believing that everything takes time
I'll make up any reason to make you mine
If you're staying or leaving, I'll follow your lead
So why keep pretending? Open your eyes
I can be what you need

Any kind of guy you want, girl, that's the guy I'll be
Turn myself upside down (Yes I will, yes I will)
Any kind of guy you want, girl, you know I'll agree
Turn your whole world around (Yes I will, yes I will)
Any kind, any kind, any kind of guy you want
You decide, change your mind, I will be there
Won't you try one more time? Be my any kind of girl (Be my girl!)
You decide, It's alright, I will be there (There)

You seem so hard to know, say goodbye, say hello
Then you say that it's time to go (Now it's time to go)
Changing my point of view, everyday something new
Anything to get next to you (Gonna get to you), oh-oh

Let me know if I'm getting through making you understand
If it's wrong I'll try something new (Try something new)
Don't look away, *'cause I'm here to stay
If it's a game, then I'm gonna play*

Any kind of guy you want, girl (Ye-eah), you know I'll agree (You know I'll agree)
