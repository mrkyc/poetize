I don't know why you always get so insecure
I wish you could see what I see
When you're looking in the mirror
And why won't you believe me when I say
That to me you get more beautiful, everyday

When you're looking at the magazines
And thinking that you'll never measure up
You're wrong

Cause you're my cover, cover girl
I think you're a superstar, yeah you are
Why don't you know
Yeah, you're so pretty that it hurts
It's what's underneath your skin
The beauty that shines within
You're the only one that rocks my world
My cover girl
Oh, my cover girl

You walk in rain boots on a perfect summer day
Somehow you always see the dark side
When everything's okay
And you wear baggy clothes
That camouflage your shape
Whoa, but you know that I love you
Just the way you're made

And thinking that you're just not good enough
You're so wrong, baby

Cause you're my cover, cover girl
I think you're a superstar, yeah you are
Why don't you know
Yeah, you're so pretty that it hurts
It's what's underneath your skin
The beauty that shines within
You're the only one that rocks my world
My cover girl
Oh, my cover girl

You've got a heart of gold, a perfect original
Wish you would stop being so hard on yourself for a while
And when I see that face, I'd try a thousand ways
I would do anything to make you smile

Cause you're my cover, cover girl
I think you're a superstar, yeah you are
Why don't you know
Yeah, you're so pretty that it hurts
It's what's underneath your skin
The beauty that shines within
You're the only one that rocks my world
