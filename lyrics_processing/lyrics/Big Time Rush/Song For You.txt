Waking up from another day, and i'm feeling so insane
Cause ever since
I saw your face
I got it tattooed on my brain

Did you know that you came and you got me like this ?
Cause I know you're the one that I wanna be with
You gotta know I'd do anything
To get you to notice me

What I gotta do to get you into my life ?
I could be your bad boy or baby I could be nice
I would give you all the stars
If you give me the night
I'am all : e-e-e-eh

There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you
Been all around the world
And no one gets me like the way you do
Baby, i thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over
But you know this song's for you
This song's for you

Now I got your attention babe
There's some things I need to say
Like you're the one that I dream about
It's on my mind like every day (every day)

Did you know that you came and you got me like this ?
Cause I know you're the one that I wanna be with
You gotta know I'd do anything
To get you to notice me
(So, tell me)

What I gotta do to get you into my life ?
I could be your bad boy or baby I could be nice
I would give you all the stars
If you give me the night
I'am all : e-e-e-eh
Got my head in the clouds
And I'm walking on air
Want you all to myself
And I don't want to share
Where you wanna go?
Cause I'm taking you there
I'am all : e-e-e-eh
There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you
Been all around the world
And no one gets me like the way you do
Baby I thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over
But you know this song's for you
This song's for you

Yo, one in a million so baby what are the odds?
A million miles away, but I know this is my song
You know you got the right girl with the right muscle
Keep you reeled in but won't knock the hassle
I want you to want me, no I don't wanna be wondering
If you wanna be with me when the skies get to thundering
I still want my heart fluttering every day without a shadow of a doubt
Baby all you gotta say

There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you
Been all around the world
And no one gets me like the way you do
Baby I thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over
But you know this song's for you
This song's for you
What I gotta do to get you into my life ?
I could be your bad boy or baby I could be nice
I would give you all the stars
If you give me the night
I'am all : e-e-e-eh
Got my head in the clouds
And I'm walking on air
Want you all to myself
And I don't want to share
Where you wanna go?
Cause I'm taking you there
I'am all : e-e-e-eh
This song's for you
This song's for you
