(Yeah yeah, oh yeah)

Still got that same look that sets me off
Guess there's just something about you
I got these feelings can't let 'em show
Cause I wouldn't let you go
I shouldn't have let you go

You asked me for closure before and
Girl, I told you it's over, it's over
It's not over
So, here we go again

It's like I'm falling in love all over again
For the first time and I know that it feels right
I think I'm falling in love all over again
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel to the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side
To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side (tonight)

I know I try to not face the truth
But no one can love me like you do
Your love is static, it pulls me in like a song when it first begins
I just don't wanna let you in, no

You just take me over and you are my controller
I told ya, I told ya, told ya
I'm ready to go again (Yeah)

It's like I'm falling in love all over again
For the first time and I know that it feels right
I think I'm falling in love all over again
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel to the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side
To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side (tonight)

Baby there's something that you did that holds me on
Maybe there's something that just keeps me from moving on
The moment I see you, I know it's going to be you
I got this figured out (Ooh)
It's like I'm falling in love all over again
For the first time and I know that it feels right
I think I'm falling in love all over again
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel to the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side
To the left, left, left
On the right, right, right
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side (tonight)

(Oh)
All over again, all over again, yeah
(Oh)
All over again, all over again, oh yeah
(Over again, ooh)
