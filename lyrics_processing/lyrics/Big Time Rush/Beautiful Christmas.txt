Let's Go!
Big Time!
Merry Christmas Everybody!

Put down video games
Pick up some candy canes
And hang a wreath on your door
Hey
Give back to those who need
Bring peace and harmony
Cause that's what Christmas is for

And this Christmas is Christmas
We'll celebrate a wonderful year
Ohh this Christmas (it's Christmas)
It's Christmas (it's Christmas)
We'll decorate the halls with love and cheer

We can make a beautiful Christmas
We can make the world shine bright
As long friends and family are with us
Every star will shine tonight
