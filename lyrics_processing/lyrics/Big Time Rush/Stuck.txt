Oh, oh, woh-oh
Woh-oh, woh-oh
Oh, oh, woh-oh

There were so many things
That I never ever got to say
Cause I'm always tongue tied
With my words getting in the way
If you could read my mind
Then all your doubts would be left behind
And every little thing
Would be falling into place

I would scream to the world
They would see you're my girl
But I just

Keep getting stuck, stuck, but I'm never giving up, up
In the middle of a perfect day, I'm tripping over words to say
'Cause I don't want to keep you guessing, but I always end up
Getting stuck, stuck, but I'm never giving up, up

It's the way that I feel
When you say what you say to me
Keeps you running through my mind
Twenty-four seven days a week
And if you've got the time
Just stick around and you'll realize
That it's worth every minute that it takes
Just wait and see

I would scream to the world
They would see you're my girl
But I just

Keep getting stuck, stuck, but I'm never giving up, up
In the middle of a perfect day, I'm tripping over words to say
'Cause I don't want to keep you guessing, but I always end up
Getting stuck, stuck, but I'm never giving up, up
I'm over the chances wasted
Tell me it's not too late
It's only the nervous times
That keep me bottled up inside

Oh, oh, woh-oh
Woh-oh, woh-oh

Keep getting stuck, stuck, but I'm never giving up, up
In the middle of a perfect day, I'm tripping over words to say
'Cause I don't want to keep you guessing, but I always end up
Getting stuck, stuck, but I'm never giving up, up

Yeah, yeah!
Oh, oh, woh-oh

Woh-oh, woh-oh
Yeah, yeah!
Oh, oh, woh-oh
Yeah-eh, eh
, baby
Cause I don't want to keep you guessing
But I always end up getting stuck, stuck
