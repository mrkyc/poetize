(Eh!)

'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around ya, around ya, ouh-woh
And nothing even matters (Eh-eh; eh!)
And nothing even matters (Eh!)

It's like one for the haters an' two for all of those
Who try to shut us down, they don't really know
There ain't nothing they can do that can tear us apart (-part), no
I don't care about the money, don't care about the clothes
When we're together, baby, anything goes (Goes)
We don't even need to prove what we feel in our hearts, no

This wall we built together
There ain't no way of knocking it over
It will be here forever
Getting closer and closer, baby!

'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around ya, around ya, ouh-woh
And nothing even matters (Eh-eh; eh!)
And nothing even matters (Eh!)
They can all talk
Say what they want about us, about us, ouh-woh
And nothing even matters (Woah; eh!)
And nothing even matters (Eh!)
See Big Time Rush LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also like
It's like the sound goes off and the people all freeze
They disappear and it's just you and me
Anything you want to do, anything that you please, oh, woah, no
Forget about our problems, forget about our past
I've seen the future and I know we're gonna last
Every second I'm with you just goes so fast, woah-oah

This wall we built together
There ain't no way of knocking it over
It will be here forever
That I told you, that I told you, baby, yeah!

'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around ya, around ya, ouh-woh
And nothing even matters (Eh-eh; eh!)
And nothing even matters (Eh!)
They can all talk
Say what they want about us, about us, ouh-woh
And nothing even matters (Woah; eh!)
And nothing even matters (Eh!)

Nothing even matters, woah
And nothing even matters
Woah, we don't even need to fight (Need to fight)
Everything will be alright (Oh, yeah)
Nothing even matters, but you and I!
'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around ya, around ya, ouh-woh (Oh!)
And nothing even matters (Eh-eh; eh!; nothing even matters)
And nothing even matters (Eh!; woah!)
They can all talk
Say what they want about us, about us, ouh-woh (Say what they want about us)
And nothing even matters (Nothing even matters cause you are!; eh!)

'Cause the world stops
When I put my arms around ya, around ya, ouh-woh (; uh-woah, woah, oh)
And nothing even matters (Nothing even matters; eh-eh)
And nothing even matters (Baby)
They can all talk
Say what they want about us, about us, ouh-woh (Oh, uh-woah)
