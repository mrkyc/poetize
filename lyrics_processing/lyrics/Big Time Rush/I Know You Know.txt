Maybe this could be the line
That starts the whole story
Maybe you could be the one
The one who's meant for me

I know that I should wait
But what if you're my soul mate?
I'll slow down when you say, slow down
We can

We can party like the weekend
You got me thinkin', we could be a thing, yeah
I know you know, I've got your heart pumping
I know you know, we know we've got something

We could be onto something so good
Tell me that your mine
I know you know, you've got my heart pumping
I know you know, we know we've got something

Do you notice me at all?
I'm usually lost for words
You know I can't help but fall
I've never felt so sure
