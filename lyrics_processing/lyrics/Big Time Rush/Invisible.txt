Do you ever wonder
When you listen to the thunder
And your world just feels so small

Put yourself on the line and time after time
Keep feeling inside that they don't know you're alive
Are you on the mind or just invisible

But I won't let you fall
I'll see you, through them all
And I just wanna let you know

Oh, when the lights go down in the city
You'll be right there shining bright
You're a star and the sky's the limit
And I'll be right by your side
Oh, you know, you're not invisible to me
(Oh, you know) you're not gonna be invisible

Do you ever think of
What you're standing at the brink of
Feel like giving up, but you just can't walk away

Night after night, always trying to decide
Are you gonna speak out or get lost in the crowd
Do you take a chance or stay invisible?

But I won't let you fall
I'll see you, through them all
And I just wanna let you know

Oh, when the lights go down in the city
You'll be right there shining bright
You're a star and the sky's the limit
And I'll be right by your side
Oh, you know, you're not invisible to me
(Oh, you know) you're not gonna be invisible

Gotta look far, I'll be where you are
I wish you could see what I see
So don't ask why, just look inside
Baby, it's all you need
And I don't understand why you won't (you won't)
Take my hand and go
Cause you're so beautiful
Oh, when the lights go down in the city
You'll be right there shining bright
You're a star and the sky's the limit
And I'll be right by your side
Oh, you know, you're not invisible to me
(Oh, you know) you're not gonna be invisible
Oh, when the lights go down in the city
You'll be right there shining bright
You're a star and the sky's the limit
And I'll be right by your side
Oh, you know, you're not invisible to me
