Do you want to ride in a big limousine?
Tell me do you want to
Take a little bite of the fame machine?
If you wanna be discovered
And end up on the cover of every
Star-studded supermarket magazine

Baby, do you need to
See your name in lights just like the Hollywood sign?

Fight the fight together

Your song is on the radio, hot rotation video
Bright lights, fan mail, paparazzi on your tail
Tour bus, private jet, thinking big ain't failed you yet
Just one thing you can't forget
Takes more than just wanting it
Aim high, never rest, put your passion to the test
Give your all, never less
