Major Lazer (Au)
Here comes the king
Ya'
Show no fear (Hey), we made it clear (Hey)
That the warriors are coming and we no play (Hey)

We at war with the army of haters
And when we kill 'em we just smoke 'em like papers
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now
You might be a lord; but here comes the king
You might be a lord; but here comes the king

Here I come-ah steppin' in the dance (Bim)
Here I come-ah steppin' in the dance (Bim)

And if you hear me come and join the revolution (Blim)
One king one faith one religion
And if you hear me come and join the revolution

They gonna love me
Call me black chutney
All gold chrome with the diamonds in the back
Lil' homies in the front don't know how to act, homie
We comin' deep and you never see us smiling
10 million strong and we rumble and we riding
Two shots up for my Africans
Been around the world and back again
Feel so good gotta let me in
Power to the people let em kiss the ring
Baow, here comes the king

We at war with the army of haters
And when we kill 'em we just smoke 'em like papers
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now

They know me in Japan and Pakistan (Auw)
Ganja makes me lord of all the land (Teight)
I'm royalty no need for me to wear a crown (Biri-bim)
Born a rebel then I became a man
I heard a voice, he said that I would understand

One king one faith one religion
And if you hear me come and join the revolution
One king one faith one religion
And if you hear me come and join the revolution

We at war with the army of haters
And when we kill 'em we just smoke 'em like papers
Somebody get me my crown cuz I'm feeling it now
You might be a lord; but here comes the king (Biri-bim)
