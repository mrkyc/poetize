When it's over now, nothing left for the enemy
When the show goes down (Down), and you silence the melody (That's when you say)
I'll be that sound boy ina L.A., rude boy ina Kingston
Bad boy ina England, New York, the whole kingdom

I ain't got the remedy
Don't wonder from-from me, you see, I'm ready, see
I'm livin' in a sin, that's how it's gonna be
I heard a voice that said that it would die for me, die for me, die for me

Wadadadang, wadadadadang, ayy (Boom-boom)
When mi come ina di dance, so now mi haffi mash it up again, ayy
Wadadadang, wadadadadang
And you know we would never, never, never stop, beat them 'til the end

See them on top of it with the man, kill a man, get a man and then one after
See it there, run to where any when nobody has do it proper
With mi and mi bred', Snoop Lion, meet his blessin', love, and honor
To all, we a part, and to all, we are even, you know say that we all prosper
News flash, flick a little ash, every website and blogger
Snoop and Buss in the studio bangin' out hits, eat little bit of snapper
Don't ever get it twisted, see we gifted when together
Reincarnated, Snoop Lion, Selassie, I forever

I ain't got the remedy
Don't wonder from-from me, you see, I'm ready, see
I'm livin' in a sin, that's how it's gonna be
I heard a voice that said that it would die for me, die for me, die for me

Somebody help me wake up and make it rain on my head
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on my head
Set me free, so complete
Everything must come to end, let it breathe

Top selected number one, Snoop D-O-double-G
A.K.A. Snoop Lion

When the background clears and you're the one left standin' there
You're runnin' out of time, you're prayin' that you make a hiss
Whatever they do, whatever they do to you-you-you
Whatever they say, whatever they say to you, you better
Sound off in that Paris
Roll call in that Lebanon
Bandoleros in the Mexico
Can you hear me, the whole kingdom?
I ain't got the remedy
Don't wonder from-from me, you see, I'm ready, see
I'm livin' in a sin, that's how it's gonna be
I heard a voice that said that it would die for me, die for me, die for me

Somebody help me wake up and make it rain on my head
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on my head
Set me free, so complete
