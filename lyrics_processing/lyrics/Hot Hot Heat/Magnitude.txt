Tossed, tossed out yesterday, that's okay
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up
If you wanna stay awake
What am I supposed to do, anyway?

Give me the cheapest good stuff you got
We can hide from the rain in the parking lot, okay
The smell of your cold skin
Makes me wanna get close again
So give me the green light that anything goes
Distract us from these soaking clothes
Give up sleep or just call in sick
All of a sudden I'm in love again so quick
(So quick)

Lost, locked out yesterday, rainy days
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
If you wanna stay awake
What am I supposed to do in this haze?
