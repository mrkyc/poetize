I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
Across the bridge on Abbott Strip
There lives a man with atlas grip
Windows covered, single mattress
On Friday nights he feeds his actress
Across the bridge on Abbott Street
There lives this girl she used to be
Still half naked she falls in traffic
You dumb ass kid here's your dumb ass life back
I won't come back crawling again
I won't come back crawling again
No I won't come back crawling again
Won't come back crawling again
I won't say anymore
I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
You might also likeSome may fear just your name
For me I wish it was the same
I'm still waiting for somebody
Ro fix this damage to my body
Some may fear the future breeds
These drunken sailors planting seeds
I'll just need this cheque to clear
So I can check right out of here
Believe me I won't come back crawling again
I won't come back crawling again
I won't come back crawling again
I won't come back crawling again
This merry-go-round has spun itself into the ground
And an eighth of me knows that an eighth of this ilfe
Is still fun as hell
But they breed you better babe
Bred you better
They bred you better than me
They breed you better babe
Bred you better
Bred you better than me
I won't say anymore
I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
I won't say anything
I won't say anymore
They breed you better babe
Bred you better
They bred you better than me
They breed you better babe
Bred you better
