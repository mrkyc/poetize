Got to hold you once again in my life
It's late, it's quiet
A taxi waits at the door
Footsteps, a door slams
What's going on, it's quarter to four
So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)
The phone keeps ringing
Are you there with a friend
I call back, it's busy
I'll hang up and try once again
So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken

So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
