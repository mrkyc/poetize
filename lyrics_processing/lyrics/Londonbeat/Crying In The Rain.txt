Slats of light on the window frame
Body tears and mind entwined
When we touched for the very last time
I won't let you see the broken me
So I guess I'll do my crying in the rain
I won't let you see the broken me
So I guess I'll do my crying
I guess I'll do my crying in the rain
This heart in this frame
Churning yearning for the peace again
Tender books in my wounded pride
When we touched for the very last time
Something died inside
I won't let you see the broken me
So I guess I'll do my crying in the rain
I won't let you see the broken me
So I guess I'll do my crying
I guess I'll do my crying in the rain
And the sobs of love fill the room
As twenty swirling swans sing our farewell tune
And the sobs sobs of love fill the room
We fly we fly we fly
And burst sparkle filled balloons

When we touched for the very last time
Something died inside
I won't let you see the broken me
So I guess I'll do my crying in the rain
I won't let you see the broken me
So I guess I'll do my crying
I guess I'll do my crying in the rain
I won't let you see the broken me
So I guess I'll do my crying in the rain
I won't let you see the broken me
So I guess I'll do my crying
I guess I'll do my crying in the rain
And the sobs of love fill the room
As twenty swirling swans sing our farewell tune
And the sobs sobs of love fill the room
We fly we fly we fly
And burst sparkle filled balloons
