Ooh
Ooh-oh-oh
She told me that it's all my fault
It woulda been a right and not another wrong (Huh)

She told me that it's all my fault
It would've been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy, not a sad song, oh
'Cause it's all my fault
She would have been perfect on her own
I should have took a right, but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy, it's a sad song, oh

She like a mouse in a mousetrap, stuck up
She got me rolling weed now, I'm fucked up
You talking too much so shut the fuck up
You heated too much, you're high, the summer
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round, momma
But you let me down
Yeah, you let me drown in drama
You're talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You're talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You're talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You're talking too much, so shut the fuck up
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round, momma
But you let me down
Yeah, you let me drown in drama
