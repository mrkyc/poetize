Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why you mad? Why you mad?
That's all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin' on your shade like a dick in your throat
Well, if you're gonna throw shade in my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in Hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin'

All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn, nigga, you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn, bitch, you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted a autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah

Uh, but you lookin' like a asshole
Up on Twitter, and you lookin' mad, woah
Talkin' 'bout me, but you lookin' bad, woah
Like the ugly daughter that I never had, woah
And what's up with these nigs?
And got my name in they mouth like they swallowin' my children
I never got why niggas hate
It's probably 'cause I'm doin' better than 'em, anyway
It's probably 'cause I get they bitches wetter, anyway
It's probably 'cause I'm livin' and they're in a lower place
They're walkin' in their sorrows while I'm vibin' out in space
Crash-land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin', they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me, but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams, and when you reach them, celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate

They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin', uh

But these haters not breathin'
Stevie Wonder to these haters, no seein', uh
And I don't believe it
They hate me, hate me for no reason
They hate me for no reason, woah
Oh-oh-oh
