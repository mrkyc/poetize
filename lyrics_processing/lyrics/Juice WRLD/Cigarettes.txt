Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, oh

Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest
I've been feelin' stressed tryna find ways to impress her
Showin' her that I love her, tryna show her a effort
Gotta keep it together, 'er

I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor, 'or
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more, 'ore
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh

She picks my heart off of the floor, 'or

Oh, oh, this a love letter that I wrote, uh
She keep me up when I'm feelin' low
She's my overdose, 'dose, 'dose
Being heartbroken is so last year
Havin' breakdowns and she wipin' my tears
I've been feelin' fine ever since she been mine
In other words, yeah, she changed my life
Open up like a book, let her read me
One call away if she ever needs me
If I ever fall apart, I know she gon' keep me together
Treat me like a promise, baby, keep me forever
