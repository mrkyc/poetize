We laughed without a care
We stepped through compliments from left and right, we poured em out
And danced between the lines
We walked on sand and silk, untangled from the world around us
What I'd give to love again, but
These over-simplified and well-intended wanderabouts
All led us down to perplexity
Just take me away
Take me away
To anywhere that's far from here
A distant place where minds are clear
A place where we listen carefully
A place where words have weight
And care prevents a thousand blames
I'll take your motions honestly
Be careful what you say to me, and
I promise to listen there
Anywhere that's far from here
A distant place where minds are clear
A place where we listen carefully
So Truth please take me away
Swept by the wings of honesty
To tropical rains or the arctic scene, seems
A place where the sun sets, not our conscience, on day one
Look, to firsthand love with our words and actions
Leave the blind echoes and our own refractions
We owe it to the past to test our future
Day two will come
Cause that's what's real when the party ends
With our eyes wide open, do we slumber with friends?
Do we ask the right questions, do we listen in turn to the word?
Cause we can go on with this masquerade
Fist bumps, streets full of signs and flames
But the truth won't wait too long in line
So, Lord, please take me away
You might also likeTake me away
To anywhere that's far from here
A distant place where minds are clear
A place where we listen carefully
A place where words have weight
And care is worth a thousand blames
I'll learn my lessons honestly
With thoughts to what You've said to me
I promise to listen there
Anywhere that's far from here
A distant place where minds are clear
A place where we listen carefully
So Truth please take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Please take me away from here
Take me away
To anywhere that's far from here
A distant place where minds are clear
A place where we listen carefully
A place where words have weight
And care is worth a thousand blames
I'll learn my lessons honestly
With thoughts to what You've said to me
I promise to listen there
Anywhere that's far from here
A distant place where minds are clear
A place where we listen carefully
So Truth please take me away
Take me away
