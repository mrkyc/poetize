I can't do a thing today
I can't see anyway
I haven't eaten all day

In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion

I can't listen to what you say
I can't understand you anyway
I haven't spoken all day

In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion

Feeling good, feeling bad
Feeling happy, feeling sad
I'm so happy, happy, sad

In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion
