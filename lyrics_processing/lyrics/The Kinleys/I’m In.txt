You give me this, I give you that
It's scary business
When your heart and soul is on the line
Baby, why else would I be standing 'round
Here so tongue-tied
If I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well, my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm in
I'm In, I'm in, I'm in
Baby, I'm in
I'm In, I'm in, I'm in
Baby come on in, the water's fine
I'll be right here, you take your time
Just let me hold you
And we'll both take that leap of faith
It's like I told you
There's no gurantee when you feel this way
You might also likeIf I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well, my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
If you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm in
I'm In, I'm in, I'm in
Baby come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can
Pour out everything I am
If I knew what I was doing
I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well, my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
If you need a lover, if you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm, Baby, I'm, Baby, I'm in
I'm In, I'm In, I'm In
Baby, I'm in
I'm In, I'm In, I'm In
Baby come here next to me
I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can
