Never even know that you and I were meant to meet
I've heard every heart is one that they were meant to hold
When it's gonna happen baby only heaven knows
It's a short lifetime
And love's too precious not to find
It's more than luck
If we're gonna meet and touch and love the one that's meant for us
Only a prayer can reach you
Only angels wings can bring you
Only a prayer can make you mine
Only a prayer can reach you
That's how god knows I need you
Only a prayer can make you mine
Wonder what you look like
Wonder what you're gonna say
When at first our eyes meet
Will we know it right away
Are you in the cafe
Right across the avenue
And baby if you are
Are you thinkin' of me too
It's a short lifetime
And love's too precious not to find
It's more than luck
If we're gonna meet and touch and love the one that's meant for us
You might also like(Only a prayer can reach you
Only angels wings can bring you
Only a prayer can make you mine
Only a prayer can reach you
That's how god knows I need you
Only a prayer can make you mine
It's a short lifetime
And love's too precious not to find
It's more than luck
If we're gonna meet and touch and love the one that's meant for us
Only a prayer can reach you
Only angels wings can bring you
Only a prayer can make you mine
Only a prayer can reach you
That's how god knows I need you
Only a prayer can make you mine
Only a prayer can reach you
Only angels wings can bring you
Only a prayer can make you mine
Only a prayer can reach you
That's how god knows I need you
