I know why you let it go
But I just can't forget, get, whoa
Yeah I'm still lying here in bed, bed
Going over everything we said, said
And it's really not my fault
I don't know what to do
It's tearing up my heart that I'm hung up on you
I don't want you, don't wanna shed another tear, tear
But I just can't control what I feel, feel
And I know this is madness, madness
I really should forget all about it
Yeah, I know this is madness, madness
I guess I must be out of my mind
Cause all I want is you, you
Can't get over you, you
On and always, you, you
No one else but you
Cause all I want is you, you
Can't get over you, you
On and always, you, you
No one else but you
Trickling out with my friends, friends
Staying out, don't mind to try every type of distraction
Just when I think it's gonna end, end
Close my eyes and there you are again, gain
And it's really not my fault
I don't know what to do
It's tearing up my heart that I'm hung up on you
I don't want you, don't wanna shed another tear, tear
But I just can't control what I feel, feel
And I know this is madness, madness
I really should forget all about it
Yeah, I know this is madness, madness
I guess I must be out of my mind
Cause all I want is you, you
Can't get over you, you
On and always, you, you
No one else but you
Cause all I want is you, you
Can't get over you, you
On and always, you, you
No one else but you
And I know this is madness, madness
I really should forget all about it
Yeah, I know this is madness, madness
I guess I must be out of my mind
Cause all I want is you, you
Can't get over you, you
On and always, you, you
No one else but you
Cause all I want is you, you
Can't get over you, you
On and always, you, you
