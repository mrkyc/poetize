Well I was walking through MacArthur park
Looking for some sugar just to cure my heart
And after dark I talk to the cabbie
Cause he drives me home if I call him daddy
And it's alright
Just as long as I can get high, sit back and watch the sunset in the sky
I don't know if you know what I mean
But it's love in Los Angeles
