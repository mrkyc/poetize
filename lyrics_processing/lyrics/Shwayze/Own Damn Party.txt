There's a party going on next door and I'm not invited
There's a party going on next door and I'm not invited
I'm gonna crash it (For sure)
I'm gonna crash it
(Let's go!)

Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I'm VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day

Shout out to my neighbor for fuckin' bein' a hater
Always cookin' some bomb shit and never gives me a plate or
Says "Hi" when I see her, in the elevator
She got a lot of cute friends, she just say I'm a player
I'm a son of the earth, been dirty since birth
11:30, I got work, but we should converse
She held on her purse, she was scared for her life
I'm a Malibu boy, hey,  all night, let's get it
Faded, not jaded, intoxicated, I'm Shwayze
They love me but hate the fact radio doesn't play me
Wouldn't sign a 360, so I just did it 180
Now I'm getting Shwasty with baby, all she got on is pasties
See Shwayze LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like

These girls are young and they reckless, that's why I'm using protection
We ain't paying for shit, but we all in your section
Yeah I'm crashing your party, like a bad intersection
All these bitches are bad, that's why I'm fucking your guest list
I'm a player with herb, conveyor of words
A lover of curves, and I'm a brother to nerds
But I don't play with dessert, 'cause my life's too sweet
And baby you deserve, a night with me
She said "Baby you trippin', I need a Jordan, not Pippen"
"You can't afford a new whip and it's time for me to stop strippin'"
I said "Girl you a stripper?", she said "Yeah don't you remember?"
Guess that's what I get for fuckin' with these girls off of Tinder

I'm gonna crash it
I'm gonna crash it
Floating down a hall of an empty building
I smell liquor in the air
(We ain't got no weed but...)
In the air
(...we got some alcohol)
Hear the sound of beer pong drinking
I smell liquor in the air
In the air
In the air
In the air

Me, and Palmula Handerson
