You should be sleepin in my bed
Hangin on to every word that I said
You should be ridin like my shotgun
Don't need a bad bitch cause I know I got one
You should be, you should be my chick, woah
You should be, you should be my chick, woah

You could be my chick, and I could be your man
Picture perfect land, baby, toes in the sand
What would you do, with a hundred grand
You'd probably build a school, give it all to the kids
That's why I dig you, cause you're an individual
Only thing I don't know is baby are you single ?
Baby are you single ? Tell me that you're single

She like diamonds so I took her to the diamond lane
She bout to get fly like the paper plane
She knows what's on my mind, we goin to the rock n roll hall of fame

You should be sleepin in my bed
Hangin on to every word that I said
You should be ridin like my shotgun
Don't need a bad bitch cause I know I got one
You should be, you should be my chick, woah
You should be, you should be my chick, woah

We got the whole world in the palm of our hand
Sing a little song just to see you dance
This could be fun, this could be tragic
This could be luck, this could be magic
You're the only one for me, I know
But there's only one thing I need to know
Baby are you single ? Tell me, are you single ?

She like diamonds so I took her to the diamond lane
She bout to get fly like the paper plane
She knows what's on my mind, we goin to the rock n roll hall of fame

You should be sleepin in my bed
Hangin on to every word that I said
You should be ridin like my shotgun
Don't need a bad bitch cause I know I got one
You should be, you should be my chick, woah
You should be, you should be my chick, woah

You should be, you should be with me, woah
You should be, you should be, be my chick, woah
Oh, you should be, you should be with me, woah
