You and I we both made our mistakes
Pulling you back in don't wash away
I wonder in my mind is it too late
Is it too late
When you shot me in the heart I ain't know what to do
I'm a lot of things but I ain't bullet proof
Sipping Malibu on the way to Malibu
How did a good girl become so rude
Even though I'm an asshole tell me that you love me
Cause I'll break your heart girl every time you let me
Baby hotter than the Malibu fire
That's when she flooded my soul with a burning desire
Rip my heart out
Make me wanna ball out
Give you everything and more I hope we never fall out
That night on stage a little cutie called out
I took her backstage that's when I saw your face
Aye
You and I we both made our mistakes
Pulling you back in don't wash away
I wonder in my mind is it too late
Is it too late

Wonder in my mind is it too late
I admit that tequila is a trigger it make me take off my clothes
Fucking and fighting is like the only things we know
I know that you're toxic why I keep coming back for more
Cause the way that you ride it is like an Uber XL
Rip my heart out
Make me wanna ball out
Give you everything and more I hope we never fall out
That night on stage I let it all out
In a drunken rage that's when I saw your face
Aye
You and I we both made our mistakes
Pulling you back in don't wash away
I wonder in my mind is it too late
