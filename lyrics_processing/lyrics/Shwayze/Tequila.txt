Ay bro, pass the tequila!

All around the world, all around the world

It's three o'clock, we early taking shots but we don't care
Fuck it, just happy I was somewhere
Chillin' with my bros, looking for some ladies
But we never call 'em hoes, even if they're actin' shady
Then we she want my dick, 'cause her name Tracy
Baby booty thick, I ain't talking 'bout maybe
One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, four
Took off her clothes before we got home
La-di-da-di, now it's a party
Baby gettin' naughty, taking shots of her body
A girl taking pictures like the paparazzi
Says she's been a fan since she seen me at The Roxy
She got class, style and moxy
We're skinny-dippin', now she think that I'm cocky
Gloves off, like we was boxing
Beat that pussy up in rounds like Rocky

Yeah, you make we wanna
Go up to the top and I ain't coming down, bae
I don't need another
Drink in my cup but I don't give a fuck
Whoa-oh, roll up the reefer
Whoa-oh, pass the tequila
(This shit feels good right here)
(What you sippin' on?)

Another round for my bae, in a song of Shway
Ay!

I don't drink Whiskey, or no Mojito
Sippin' Don Julio, or Casamigos
Feeling like a million bugs, when I'm chillin'
Drunk off tequila 'cause I can give zero
Fucks, what you thinkin'? Beer Pong kingpin
My girl got a girl and they wanna be my girlfriends
One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, four
And took of my clothes before we got home
Shwasted on a Sunday, shouldn't be in church
Booty so good, make a nigga write a verse
And we wanna work out, gave baby two shots
Now baby twerking out and can't find her purse
Getting outta this world, can't seem to find earth
I'm in an Uber and that's when I heard
"Shwayze, let's take another shot baby"
Yeah, you make we wanna
Go up to the top and I ain't coming down, bae
I don't need another
Drink in my cup but I don't give a fuck
Whoa-oh, roll up the reefer
Whoa-oh, pass the tequila
(Oh I'm feeling so good right now)
(What you sippin' on?)

Na, na, na, na, na
Tequila!
Na, na, na, na, na
Tequila!
Na, na, na, na, na

All around the world, all around the world
Another round for my bae, in a song of Shway
Ay!

Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Oh yeah
What you sippin' on?

Me? I be drinking that Tequila
