You gotta meet my new girlfriend
There's nothing like, there's nothing like my new girlfriend
I kinda like ya, there's nothing like my new girlfriend

Yo, she's at it again like Marilyn
Out of control like Anna Nicole
Stuck on her love like heroin
My baby's hot, my baby's cold
Life is a game, must stop and go
Vanilla sky to my rocky road
She said, "This ain't the life I chose."
But she my little miss rock n roll

Hot tan lines in the summer
Rock fe berg in the center
Move your waist line to the bass line
Groove, cause I don't wanna waste time
I think I like her, I think I really do
Cause I keep running back to you, to you

There she goes, walking down the street
To the march of her own drum, can you feel the beat?
There she goes, the kind of girl for me, she's gotta be

You gotta meet my new girlfriend
There's nothing like, there's nothing like my new girlfriend
I kinda like ya, there's nothing like my new girlfriend

She's Mary Kate, she's Ashley
She don't care that I'm ashy
She's hella cool there by the pool
Dropped out of school, but she classy
I know she ain't no shady chick
I even like her crazy ticks
She's fucked around with baby dicks
But now she on that Shwayze shit

Hot tan lines in the summer
Rock fe berg in the center
Move your waist line to the bass line
Groove, cause I don't wanna waste time
I think I like her, I think I really do
Cause I keep running back to you, to you

There she goes, walking down the street
To the march of her own drum, can you feel the beat?
There she goes, the kind of girl for me, she's gotta be
You gotta meet my new girlfriend
There's nothing like, there's nothing like my new girlfriend
I kinda like ya, there's nothing like my new girlfriend
