Baby will you be my Corona and lime?
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We can take it to the street

Yo
Little girls in the city, dress up pretty
Go out and get messed up and shitty
Girls by the sea, dress like hippies
And rock love beads and go skinny-dippin'
Girls in the hills, go day trippin'
To get their nails done, and hair straightened
Little girls in the 818
Get hot when I roll over Laurel Canyon

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her, but I'll get her when I do
Let me tell you about a girl I love
She stay at home 'cause she hate the club
Baby butt, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

Girls in New York look like giraffes
Long neck, long legs, tiny tits and ass
Girls from L.A. rock oversized shades
And chill all day, 'cause they already paid
Girls in Miami, string bikinis
Bump techno by DJ Tiesto
Girls from Detroit, like electro
And dance all night 'til they break they neck, yo

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
Let me tell you about a girl I love
Let me tell you about a girl I love

Now if you lookin' for love, won't you put you hands up
If you lookin' for love, won't you put you hands up
If you lookin' for love, then I'm lookin' for love, huh
If you lookin' for love, then I'm lookin' for love
Now if you lookin' for love, won't you put you hands up
