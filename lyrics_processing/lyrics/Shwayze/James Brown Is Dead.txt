The man on the radio said
James Brown is dead
Godfather of soul, lays in his bed, yeah
Have you heard what the kids are listening to?

Woke up (Got high), sho'nuff (Sky high)
Got in the ride, turned the radio up
Then they said James Brown is dead
Is it true? Or am I just doped up?
Know what? I called my folks up
They said he died 'cause hip-hop sucks
Ain't got no soul like a old pair of Chucks
It's about time somebody stepped up

And the man on the radio said
I regret to report
James Brown is dead
Just press record
Godfather of soul, lays in his bed, yeah
Have you heard what the kids are listening to?

Hit the studio (Check, 1, 2), sho'nuff
Yo, Cisco, turn my headphones up
I got a message for the kids of America
Play it loud in your hi-fi stereo
Wi-fi, download the ringtone
"California Love" is your theme song
Drop the guitar, let me hear the beat, y'all
Do like Dr. Brown and move your feet, y'all

I just got back from a little vacation
Grew some wings and flew to Vegas
Met a girl, took her 'round the world
From New York, New York to Caesar's
Now I'm sitting in L.A. alone
I fell asleep with my blue jeans on
I woke up, had three missed calls
They said James Brown is gone

James Brown is dead
I regret to report
