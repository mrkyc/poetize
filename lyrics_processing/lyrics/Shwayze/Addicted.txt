She's addicted, to my dick, dick
But I don't fall in love, like my shoes are untied
But then I kicked it, and it was different
Like I was smoking an L, and it's a brand new high
When I hit it, I don't wanna pass it around
Love coma, and it's all coming back to me now (Back to me now)
Coming back to me now
Love coma 'cause her booty keep on knockin' me out
