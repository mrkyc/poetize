You a hear me selecta
A more music and less talk
I would a talk to the youth them world wide
But let me start from east
And forward out to the west side
Up top jungle all bout Zimbabwe Angola
Hear me out laawd...

Say you a badman fine
And you don't step and left your gun no time
Say them heartless and mean when them a step with them team
Now a white suit and tape from forsensic
Weh mi say steppa steppa a nuh petty thief steppa a nuh taker
Man nah step fi the worst man ago step for the betta
Step inna Great Britain step inna merry macka
Two degrees cold man a step when it hotta
No make no mistake confuse steppa with shotta
Man a step and survive shotta brain get splatta
If you think a lie ask big foot and fatta weh me say? I ask them
Say you a badman fine
And you don't step and left your gun no time
Say them heartless and mean when them a step with them team
Now a white suit and tape from forsensic

Wire tap surveillance agents and snitch
Step no time to linger man haffi move through quick
No shells left behind you better move well legit
Solid composure youth your head can't sick
Woman and pickney still off limit
A steppa never tell his woman him secret
Whether you step in a private or inna public
Steppa code remember the steppa ethics

Steppa steppa a no pettie thief steppa a no taker
Man nah step fi the worst man ago step for the betta
Step inna Great Britain step inna merry macka
Two degrees cold man a step when it hotta
No make no mistake confuse steppa with shoota
Steppa step and survive shotta brain get splatta
If you think a lie ask Kojack and fatta

Say you a badman fine
And you don't step and left your gun no time
Say them heartless and mean when them a step with them team
Now a white suit and tape from forensic
Steppa steppa a no pettie thief steppa a no taker
Man nah step fi the worst man ago step for the betta
Step inna Great Britain step inna merry macka
Two degrees cold man a step when it hotta
No make no mistake confuse steppa with shoota
Steppa step and survive shotta brain get splatta
If you think a lie ask Kojack and fatta
