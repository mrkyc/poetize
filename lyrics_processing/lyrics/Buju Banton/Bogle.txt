New style!
Style a style, and style cyan spoil
All the girls dem jump and shock out for awhile
Watch this!

New year, new style, new dance a lick
Fling your hands inna di air, then you rock, then you dip
Move to the drum and make your body tic
Step forward and come up back quick
That a the new style weh the whole place a do
Rock Bogle Dance from music sweet you
Bogle a run the place night and day
So just rock Bogle Dance from a your tune a play

A mussi Nanny that? After anuh so Bogle stay!
She cyan do it good, but she a rock same way

All Wayne Wonder stiff like piece of wood
Favor idiot and cyan do Bogle good!
