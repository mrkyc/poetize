Happiness is what I feel
This is what I've got to reveal
I'll be your friend
To the end like "Chucky"
Do you understand?
I'm reaching out to the love of my life
Everlasting!
See yah!

You're the rose in my garden, pretty little flower
Guardian angel, fairy godmother
A friend to the end and also a lover
My one and only, I don't need another
You're the heat in my winter and the breeze in my summer
