I might not show it cause I can't find words to say
I try to say I love you, but I get tongue tied
I start to raise a word and fail in every way
I wish you would stay longer (just a lickle longer)
Bright up my life like Disney World woahah (see yah)
I wish you would stay longer
(to make me stronger and stronger)
But just like magic you were gone
See yah, woman just a lickle more time
Could you stay in a mi world
I want you brighten a mi life
A make it glisten like pearl
Just a lickle more time
Could you stay inna mi world
I want you brighten a mi life
A make it glisten like..
You're a nice and decent well brought up girl
Be the pillar to my castle
The mistress to my world
Lighten up my life cause
Youre no shy shy girl
I wan you, open your life
And give me full control
You might also likeI wish you would stay longer(just a lickle longer)
Bright up my life like Disney World woahah
(see yah, merry go round)
I wish you would stay longer (don't disappear)
But just (stay right here) like magic you were gone
(I sing) you were gone (eh eh)
With a zig and a zag
A disappearing act
Gone out a mi life
And a how she come back
So much things to say
So much much things to chat
Hand pon yer leg
And mi mind pon yer ?
Just a likle more time
Could you stay in a mi world
Want you brighten a mi life
A make it glisten like pearl
Lickle more time
Wan you ? in a mi world
Want you brighten a mi life
A make it glisten like pearl
I could not ask for more (eh eh)
When ever youre in town (see yah)
Situation gets serious (and wha)
I feel my knees begin to shake
Hearts beating out of rhythm
Glad its no DR's case
Must get my act together
To lose you would be sucha waste
I wish you would stay longer(if even fi a minute)
Bright up my life like Disney World
I wish you would stay longer girl
But just like magic you were gone(come back)
Oh Honey you're gone(eh eh)
(you bring sorrow to mi heart
And sadness to mi face
Trembling from mi hip?
Go down straight to mi waist
And when you ...
Mash up mi heart an a
Mash up mi place an a
Step in a hurry and
Move inna haste
So much things to say
I wanna tell it to yer face
But i can't find the words
To fit the perfect space
Just a likle more time
Could you stay in a mi world
I want you brighten a mi life
A make it glisten like pearl
Likle more time

I want you brighten up mi life
A make it glisten like pearl
Lickle more time)
