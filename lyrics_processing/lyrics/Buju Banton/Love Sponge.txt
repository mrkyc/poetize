Got to let this woman yah know its real

This one is called lovers choice
Never know you woulda really feel so nice, love sponge
I don't wanna let you go
With you I'm in no hurry
Oh no
This one is called lovers choice
Never know you woulda really feel so nice, love sponge
I don't wanna let you go
With you I'm in no hurry

Lord, you are lovable, kissable
Desire, the inevitable
Without your sweet caress I'm so damn miserable
Touch your finesse, feel the fur of your coat
Seen you walk away saying my eyes in smoke
You are dressible, lookable
All the man dem after you
They claim, you do something they just can't explain
To the brain
Your man shouldn't have no complain
Oh no

Hey, slow motion is the way for us to enjoy the day
Always taking time to listen what she got to say
She thinks I've been spending too much time on the beat
I try to make her overstand that's how we eat
"Darling, don't quarrel with me, it hurts you too easily"
"Don't be messed up by silly tendency"
No, no way


She make I cyan forget about the hugging and squeezing
I feel as if I'm upside down, in the ceiling
Confess, this girl is the ultimate thing
What it means to be loved, need no asking
Swing baby, swing, while I continue sing your favrite song
Let's go dancing
Hey


You are lovable, kissable
Desire, the inevitable
Without your sweet caress I'm so damn miserable
I take a smoke and I nearly choke
Oh God, this girl is serious and she's no joke
She's just dressible, lookable
All the man dem after you
They claim, you do something they just can't explain
To the brain
Oh gosh, your man couldn't have no complain
Bow!
