Music...
Splash! And everything wet up
All the girls dem, get up, stand up, and jump up, and pump up
Music...
Everytime
Baby girl, train of mind
You know why?
Music...

I have never seen a girl whose so pretty and so fair
With those pretty likkle red, red roses in her hair
Never seen a girl whose so pretty and so fair
With those pretty likkle red, red roses in her hair
Music...

Me woulda walk from Hanover, right down inna Vere
Hope when I reach your likkle love no disappear
To treat it just like a medal, pon the Bible I swear
Shine it down that it will never smear
When this true life sweet you, don't let love disappear
I am warm and tender and cuddly like a bear
Some of your love potion, I'm begging for a share
I haffi reload lyrics like me named Pastor Blair
You might also like
I have never seen a girl whose so pretty and so fair
With those pretty likkle red, red roses in her hair
Never seen a girl whose so pretty and so fair
With those pretty likkle red, red roses in her hair

To have and to hold was the ultimate goal
One bag of reasons she a read from a scroll
True me named Gargamel, that simply means I must patrol
Bound pon mi compound
Cho, Buju B. telling the world all around
Woman, jump up 'cause you anuh puppet or clown
Hand inna the air, nobody can hold you down
You look good, and you no stop wake the town

Never seen a girl whose so pretty and so fair
With those pretty likkle red, red roses in her hair
Never seen a girl whose so pretty and so fair
With those pretty likkle red, red roses in her hair

Jamaican girls, Buju say unuh gone clear
Hand inna the air, jump up, jump up
New York massive, Buju say unuh gone clear
Hand inna the air, jump up, jump up
From you large and you anuh mascot
Hand inna the air, jump up, jump up
Pretty like Benz, you no favor old truck
Hand inna the air, jump up, jump up
A wha' dem ago do fi touch your thermos?
Gwan gyal pickney, you wicked and rough
From you know say you're fat, I wanna see you grab it up
'Cause a Buju Banton, you me haffi rush
Gyal, you look good, you mussi possess the touch
I've ever seen a girl whose so pretty and so fair
With those pretty likkle red, red roses - badang!
I've never seen a girl whose so pretty and so fair
With those pretty likkle red, red - once more!

Me woulda walk from Hanover, right down inna Vere
Hope when I reach your likkle love no disappear
To treat it just like a medal, pon the Bible I swear
Shine it down that it will never smear
When this true life sweet you, don't let love disappear
