I want you carry this round the road fi me
And don't tek nuh talk from nobody
Just do weh mi tell yuh fi do seen star
And mek sure everyting work according to how man seh everyting fi work seen
Take back yourself and bring back yourself inna one piece
Mek sure say you reach, hear me?
Lord have mercy, hey, lord have his mercy, lord have mercy

Driver, don't stop at all, drop this Arizona 'round ah Albemarle
Driver, don't even itch, collect dat little food there yeah and come back quick
Driver, just remember the damn speed limit
Cause if you, run in the Feds, my friend that is it

I got a Nextel phone and ah cellular chip
Any problem you can reach me 'pon this
A pounds them ah buy when ah tons them ah ship
Green like grass, brown like chocolate
Fed Ex or UPS ah make several trip
All my life savings ah ride 'pon this
You can, drink a beer but don't yuh dare burn a spliff
The scent of the marijuana make your life uplift
Even though it compress and tie inna plastic
Don't deliver it ah go end up drastic
Ah barrel gun me bust and me you know it can't stick
Me want change my zinc and put up there chrome stick
Tired fi sip Red Bull, ah straight Hypnotic

Ah business man ah run mi nuh inna no "but" nor "because"
My girl want wear Victoria Secret draws
Sam no love pay so you fi put him 'pon pause
Billy ah informa wid federal charge
'Memba, don't carry no body ah me yard
Soldier me love and me no respect coward
I deh 'pon a mission, Man hustling hard
No ghetto youth should ever suffer and starve
Hustling ability: we learn that a Yaad
No feel your brain big, no bother draw card
The last boy weh try that, dead like dog
Sell off!!!
What yuh have ah make we set new record


Action packed why some boy ah pure lip
Go there Buju Banton cause yuh know yuh can't slip
Reach upon the bridge fi make them turn and dip
Watch it make the rudebwoy show them how we do it
