Woman sing all about dere wanting this
Hear why
Thought I could live without you
(Eh, eh)
Thought everything would be fine
Saw nothing special about you
But still you were plauging my mind
I used to take you for granted
You were the last name in my life
Presently you're the most wanted
At the top of my life and it was yesterday when
I saw you down my lady
You were with my best friend
(Jealousy reign)
All
(Trop-a-tane?)
(Talking game)
(And!)
And now I'm falling in love all over again, yeah
How could I ever doubt that you were my friend?
You might also like(I'm)

All over again
(Over and over, watch this)
How could I ever doubt that you were my friend?
(Beres!)
Who say that big man don't cry?
Yuh never miss di water till di well run dry
Could yuh find it in yuh heart
To give me one more bly
I won't abuse the situation, this time I won't lie
By mi nightly conversation also mi lullaby
Freshly squeeze orange juice
An mi eggs well fried
Garments well cleaned, from mi socks to mi tie
She's a friend, also a lover
Dat mean me nah fi shy, me express meself
Straight up to the sky
(Oh)
Who say that big man don't cry?
Yuh never miss di water till yuh well run dry

Who say that big man don't cry?
Now I'm falling in love all over again

Falling in love
All over again
(As I was saying)
How could I ever doubt that you were my friend?
(Watch this!)

All over the earth
Di woman dem God bless
Put pan di earth fi mind the man and make dem tek set

Discuss matters over cup a tea
And kiss and caress

Don't ask the DJ why

Didn't know you were my friend
