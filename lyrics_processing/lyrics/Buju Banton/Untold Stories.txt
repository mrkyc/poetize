Thanks I'll Be Giving
To the Most High You know

I am living while I am living to the father I will pray
Only him knows how we get through everyday
With all the hike in the price
Arm and leg we have to pay
While our leaders play

All I see people a rip and a rob and a rival
Thief never love fe see thief wid long bag
No love for the people who a sufferin bad
Another toll to the poll may God help we soul
What is to stop the youths from get out of control
Full up of education yet no own no payroll
The clothes on my back have countless eyehole.
I could go on and on the full has never been told


Who can afford to run will run
But what about those who can't... they will have to stay
Opportunity a scarce, scarce commodity
In these times I say... When mama spend her last and send you go class
Never you ever play
It's a competitive world for low budget people
Spending a dime while earning a nickel
With no regards to who it may tickle
My cup is full to the brim
I could go on and on the full has never been told

Tief never love fe see tief wid long bag
No love for the people who a sufferin bad
Another toll to the poll may God help we soul
What is to stop the youths from get out of control
Full up of education yet no on no payroll
The clothes on my back have countless eyehole
Could go on and on and the fool has never been thrown
(On and On)
Though this life keep getting me down
Don't give up now
Got to survive somehow
Could go on and on and the full has never been told
