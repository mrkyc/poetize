Jah Jah Jah, Rastafari
Haile Selassie I who lives and rules the brains of all living things
King of all kings, ruler of tings

Lord give I strength
Never let I fail
To live out the greater part of my days
Give I strength
Jah give I strength
Never let I fail
To live out the greater part of my days
Give I strength

Indeed I see pestilence and plague
But I'm not afraid
They are looking for what they can take
Come in all size appear in all shape
Lord give us the vision to differentiate
Yeah there they wait, we shall escape
God who protect is greater than great
In all that we do, He holds our fate

Jah Jah give I strength
Never let I fail
To live out the greater part of my days
Give I strength
Jah give I strength
Never let I fail
To live out the greater part of my days
Give I strength

Teach the youths them right in the way they should grow
Joy is a stream, constantly flow
And I don't want to be unhappy
Let me live till I'm grey
I work hard to get pay
Keep out of tale bearers and back-biters way
Never let the seeds of education decay no way

Jah Jah give I strength
Never let I fail
To live out the greater part of my days
Give I strength
Jah give I strength
Never let I fail
To live out the greater part of my days
Give I strength
(Shiloh!)

As plain as day (????)
Is that they will not listen
I see unattemptively, witnessing tears rolling down cheeks
They deny about the damage, they call it miscarriage
Oh Jah strengthen my heart for me please
Jah Jah give I strength
Never let I fail
To live out the greater part of my days
Give I strength
Jah give us strength
Never let us fail
Live out the greater part a we days
Give us strength

He who suffers, conquers, winning the crown of victory in the end
The hour is near arise and defend
Oh Jah our freedom we bear!

Cause whyyyyyy
Teach the youths them right in the way they should grow
Joy is a stream constantly flow
And I don't wanna be unhappy
Let me live till I'm grey
I work hard to get pay
Keep out of tale bearers and back-biters way
Never let this bit of education decay no way

Jah Jah give I strength
Never let I fail
