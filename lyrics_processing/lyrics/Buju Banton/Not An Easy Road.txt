I never thought I would've made it
Then afterwards, they mistake it, chro
I'll be here for sure, don't worry
And mi say my, my, my m-my

It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows
I cry!
It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain

From the minute of birth, you enter this earth
Obstacles deh inna your way to overcome first
Throughout everyday they seem to get worse
Oh my God, cast away this curse!
Everybody ah try fi make every end meet
Through every way they endeavor
Lord God you see it
No matter what the world may say out ah street
Must affi survive, won't accept defeat
Now I'm weary, tired and dreary
Got no time to waste
You better know that
You might also like
It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows
I cry!
It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows

While you rise to see the sun
Who you love a pull you down
Trying to discredit the works you have done
Some can't satisfy with the past of ally
From the Scribes and Pharisees
You've got to stay wide
Hold up me head glancing on both side
A wait, anticipate, pray fi you to slide
Righteousness prevail with Jah by my side
Deliver Jonah from the whale
No leave him to die
Help us all Abbabajoni
Hold up my head and cry
I tell you now
It's not an easy road, Oh no
It's not an easy road

I've been travelling morning
With such a heavy load
Now it's noon and I cannot afford
To put down that burden 'longside the road
Yea, I've got to hold it
I got to humble myself like a child
Upon my face I've the got to put on a smile
Make up my mind just to walk more miles
Oh God I've got to, I've got to, because I know that

It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows
Hot foot
It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows
From the minute of birth, you enter this earth
Obstacles deh inna your way to overcome first
Throughout everyday they seem to get worse
Oh my God, cast away this curse!
Everybody ah try fi make every end meet
Through every way they endeavor
