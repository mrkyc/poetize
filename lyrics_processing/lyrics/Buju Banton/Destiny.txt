Cast away their cords from us, Lord
You have them in derision in the valley of decision
Restraining the heathen with a rod of iron
You know not the destiny of a next man
Why hold him set him free for too long

Though forces try to hold I down
Breaking chains has become the norm
I know I must get through no matter what a gwaan

Destiny, mama look from when you calling
I wanna rule my destiny
Lord, & I tell you once more
