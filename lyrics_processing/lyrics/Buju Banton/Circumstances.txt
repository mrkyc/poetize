Circumstances made me what I am
Was I born a violent man?
Circumstances made me what I am
Everyone should understand
Circumstances made me what I am
Was I born a violent man?
Circumstances made me what I am
Everyone should know

May sound strange, might sound foolish
But things ain't getting better
Everyday another fall victim to the Beretta
Why is there so much violence
Killing we one another
Let us learn to live and let that light shine brighter
Bad influence through influence the youth dem get slaughter
As bad as badman use to be
Dem respect di father
Is like no eyes no realize seh
Times get harder
Mi talk all night with all mi might
But still is laughter

Circumstances made me what I am
Was I born a violent man?
Circumstances made me what I am
And everyone should know
You might also like
Him say, when I try to cope
Tell mi self there is hope
It seems like the biggest joke
Eh eh
And as I put down the gun
Still dollars must run
All now employment can't come
Have mi a jam and a cool
Want go back in a school
The system lick mi
There's no hope for those
Who have not from the slum
Take di little much we have
Still hunting we down
I beg unu show some love
Unu wi get back, he replied

Circumstances made me what I am
Was I born a violent man?
Circumstances made me what I am
And everyone should know

Well a no little cry
Mama cry, papa cry, too
She warn the bwoy with all heart
And that couldn't do
Now dem find him dead with a Smith & Wesson
Six weeks and change
Now mi hear him missing
Why so much violence, too much violence
It hurts my soul and I won't keep silent
Circumstances made me what I am
That was his reply, I cry
Circumstances made me what I am
Everyone should know

May sound strange, might sound foolish
But things ain't getting better
Everyday another fall victim to the Beretta
Why is there so much violence
Killing we one another
Let us learn to live and let that light shine brighter
Bad influence through influence the youth dem get slaughter
As bad as badman use to be
Dem respect di father
Is like no eyes no realize seh
Times get harder
Mi talk all night with all mi might
