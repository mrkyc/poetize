One more day in the struggle
Haffi get up and go juggle, you done know
Water and a little sugar inna we pan
Me nah seek fi trouble no man
Oh oh

Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah put an angel over me
Be strong
Hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Say, one day things must get better
Be strong
And I say, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Chant, one day things must get better

The rich is wise in his own conceit
But the fool with overstanding searcheth him out
Poor man mourn, the rich riches increase
I said, be not grieved, riches are not forever
Envy not the oppressor, choose none of his ways
Be not wise in thine own eyes, only Jah you must praise
Strive not with a man without cause
If he have done you no harm, let bygones be bygones
You might also like
Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah put an angel over me
Be strong
And I say, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above that water
One day things must get better
Be strong
And I say, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Say, one day things must get better

This 9 to 5 is a joke compared to the pressure
The minister says the economy is getting better
Misleading the people, the mass still suffers
Oh Jah, scarce benefits and spoils
Oh
Jah knows that we feel it, woah, woah, woah, woah
Day and night we cry, cry, cry
Jah knows that we feel it, woo, woo, woo
Who can help a weeping soul like I?

Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah put an angel over me
Be strong
And I say, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above that water
One day things must get better
Be strong
And I bawl, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Say, one day things must get better
The rich is wise in his own conceit
But the poor with overstanding searcheth him out
Poor man mourn, the rich riches increase
I said, be not grieved, riches are not forever
Envy not the oppressor, choose none of his ways
Be not wise in thine own eyes, only Jah you must praise
Strive not with a one without cause
If they have done thee no harm, let bygones be bygones

Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah put an angel over me
Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah Jah put an angel -
And I say, be strong, oh oh
Hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Chant, one day things must get better
Be strong
And I bawl, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't go down, keep your head above the water
