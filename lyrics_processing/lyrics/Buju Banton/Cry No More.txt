Don't cry!
Oh no, oh no

I never wanna see you crying over me
You know thats not the way that it's supposed to be
Oh no, no no no no
You gotta be strong
Never wanna see you crying over me
You know thats not the way that it's supposed to be
Oh no, oh no no no no
You gotta be strong
Oh my love
Verse1:
I know, I've hurt you more than once (once, twice, three times)
Treating your love like i don't response
Time in deed caught up on me
Trapped in your tears, please set me free
I plea
Maybe I took this life for granted
Making you feel like your not wanted
Ego got the best of me
Chasing every beautyfull woman I see
In the end what's my reward?
I brought unhappyness in a mi yard
Oh lord

Never wanna see you crying over me
You know thats not the way that it's supposed to be

Verse2:
And this may sound just like a drama
Inside me there's a constant fire
Burning my soul, saying oh what a liar
You've hurt her so much times, hurt her no longer
But I'm a really true believer, in love
Trying my best to make it work
Show my a man who doesn't cheat nor flirt
In this world
Boys will be attracted to girls
Chorus:
I never wanna see you crying over me
You know thats not the way that it's supposed to be
Oh no, no no no no
You gotta be strong
I never wanna see you crying over me
You know thats not the way that it's supposed to be
Oh no, no no no no
No no no...
Oh my love
