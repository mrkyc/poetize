It's so good
To praise the most high Jah everyday
With your whole heart desire
Lift him higher, lift him higher
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, yeah
Holy Mount Zion I
Buju, let's sing it...

Toodoo doo doo doo doo doo
Toodoo doo doo doo do
Doo doo doo doo doo doo do
Toodoo doo doo doo doo doo

The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want
He make me down to lie
In pastures green Jah leadeth me
The quiet waters by
My soul thou hath restored again
And me to walk dost make
Within the path of righteousness
Even for his name's sake
Yeh, though I walk in death's dark vale
Yet will I fear no ill
Thy rod and staff, they are with me
They surely comfort still
Ooh, my table thou hast furnished
In the presence of my foes
My head thou hath anoint with oil
My cup it overflow
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me (follow me)
And in Jah's house for I-ver more
My dwelling place must be
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me
And in Jah's house for I-ver more
My dwelling place shall be

Holy, holy, holy
Toodoo doo doo doo doo doo
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Doo doo doo doo doo doo do

Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me
And in Jah's house for I-ver more
My dwelling place must be
My soul thou hath restored again
And me to walk dost make
Within the path of righteousness
Even for his name's sake
Yea, though I walk through death's dark vale
Yet will I fear no ill
Thou are with me, thy rod and thy staff
They surely comfort still
My table thou hath furnished
In the presence of my foes
My head thou hath anoint with oil
My cup it overflow
Toodoo doo doo doo doo doo
