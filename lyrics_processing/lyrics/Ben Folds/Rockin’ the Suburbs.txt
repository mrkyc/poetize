Let me tell y'all what it's like
Being male, middle-class, and white
It's a bitch if you don't believe
Listen up to my new CD
(Sha-mon)

I got shit runnin' throught my brain
It's so intense that I can't explain
All alone in my white-boy pain
Shake your booty while the band complains

I'm rockin' the suburbs
Just like Michael Jackson did
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Except that he was talented
I'm rockin' the suburbs
I take the checks and face the facts
That some producer with computers fixes all my shitty tracks

I'm pissed off, but I'm too polite
When people break in the McDonald's line
Mom and Dad you made me so uptight
I'm gonna cuss on the mic tonight
See Ben Folds LiveGet tickets as low as $28You might also likeI don't know how much I can take
Girl, give me something I can break

I'm rockin' the suburbs
Just like Quiet Riot did
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Except that they were talented
I'm rockin' the suburbs
I take the checks and face the facts
That some producer with computers fixes all my shitty tracks

In a haze these days
I pull up to the stop light
I can feel that something's not right
I can feel that someone's blasting me with hate
And bass
Sendin' dirty vibes my way
'Cause my great, great, great, great granddad
Made someone's great, great, great, great, granddaddies slaves
It wasn't my idea
It wasn't my idea
Never was my idea
I just drove to the store
For some Preparation H
Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle-class and white
Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle-class and white
Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle-class and white
Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male, middle class and white
It gets me real pissed off, it makes me wanna say
It gets me real pissed off, and it makes me wanna say
It gets me real pissed off, and it makes me wanna say
Fuck!

Just like Jon Bon Jovi did
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Except that he was talented
I'm rockin' the suburbs
I take the checks and face the facts
That some producer with computers fixes all my shitty tracks
These days
Yeah yeah
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Yeah yeah
I'm rockin' the suburbs
Yeah yeah
You'd better look out, because I'm gonna say 'Fuck'
You'd better look out, because I'm gonna say 'Fuck'
You'd better look out, because I'm gonna say 'Fuck'
