No matter what you might do
There's always someone out there
Cooler than you
I know that's hard to believe
But there are people you meet
They're into
Something
That is too big to be expressed
Through their clothes
And they'll put up
With all the poses you throw
And you won't even know
That they're not sizing you up
They know your ma fucked you up
Or maybe let you watch
Too much TV
But they'll still look in your eyes
To find the human inside
You know there's always something
In there to see
Beneath the
Veneer
Not everybody made the list this year
Have a beer

Make me feel tiny
If it makes you feel tall
But there's always someone
Cooler than you

Yeah, you're the shit
But you won't be it for long
Oh there's always someone
Cooler than you
Yeah, there's always someone
Cooler than you
Now that I've got the disease
In a way I'm relieved
Cause I don't have to stress about it
Like you do
I might just get up and dance
Or buy some acid-washed pants
When you don't care
Then you've got nothing to lose

Make me feel tiny
If it makes you feel tall
But there's always someone

Life is wonderful
Life is beautiful
We're all children of
One big universe
So you don't have to be
A chump

That I won't

Cooler than you
