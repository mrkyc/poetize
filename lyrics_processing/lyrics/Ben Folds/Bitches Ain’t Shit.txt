Bitches ain't shit
Bitches ain't shit

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Let's get the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than the motherfucking gangster beats
And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep that shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do
Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the ends that she got meant nothing
And now she's suing cause the shit she be doing ain't shit
(Bitches can't hang with the streets) She found herself short
(Now she's taking me to court) That's real conversation for your ass
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucka licking the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back in the motherfucking county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scooped in a coupe, "Snoop we got the news
Your girl was tricking while you was draped in the county blues"
I ain't been out a second
And already I gotta do some motherfucking chin checkin'
Move up the block as we groove down the block
See my girl's house, "Dre, pass the Glock"
Kick in the do' and I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my ho"
I uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
(Man, fuck that bitch!)
(Three, four...)

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Let's get the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

Bitches can't hang with the streets
