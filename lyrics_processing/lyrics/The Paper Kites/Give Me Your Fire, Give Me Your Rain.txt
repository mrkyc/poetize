I could notice all the lines and I'd only go insane
I could love you all the time, I'm not always gonna say

Still I don't wanna feel it without you
Don't wanna feel it with no one else
Give me your fire, give me your rain
Give me a little love from you

I can fan a fire, I can keep it from burning away
But what's it gonna take to stop the silence?
I could live as a liar, say that I'm turning away
But giving up won't give up desire

And I don't wanna feel it without you
Don't wanna feel it with nobody else
Give me your fire, give me your rain
Give me a little love from you

Give me your fire, give me your rain
A little love from you
Give me your fire, give me your rain
A little love from you
You might also like
(Give me your fire, give me your rain)
Watching windows, watching stars
(A little love from you)
Coloured lights and empty bars
(Give me your fire, give me your rain)
All the houses in the yard
(A little love from you)
All the streets and passing cars
(Give me your fire, give me your rain)
What's the distance where you are?
(A little love from you)
Can I make it back to your heart?

Give me your fire, give me your rain
A little love from you
Give me your fire, give me your rain
A little love from you
Give me your fire, give me your rain
A little love from you
Give me your fire, give me your rain
A little love from you
Give me your fire, give me your rain
A little love from you
Give me your fire, give me your rain
