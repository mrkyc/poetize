Another one runnin and another one gunnin
?? from random slums and I ain't down with those bums
Some fun it's gotta be to grab your pee pee
And sing so sweetly to the front row seat
Buts thats the way it be watchin that damn TV
Since you free come and spread it up Missouri
Run Daddy run
Yea I fires them all but they be commin back
Run daddy run
Black hat and black hearts to match
Run daddy run
See you give em a yard you best forget the vig
Cause this ain't the next whomever it's the new kid
Let me see what you got baby open it up
If that's a big bag of money we be divvyin up
If that's a spliff in your mouth best be lightin it up
I need a drink cause the bass is spillin my cup
I get up I get down god willin and able
Bumps to many friends stole some cable
Some time I speak my mind rather plainly but I'm not a dick like Cheney
You take 10 drug dealers and a Chinese bordello stick em out
In Arkansas I sure do do well
For commin straight out the ground born fighter F*ckin up your Christmas
Like I'm scammin a lighter
Now look at yourself rollin in the blues
You do it to yourself you do, you do
Run Daddy run
See I fires them all but they be commin back
Run daddy run
Black hats and black hearts to match
Run daddy run
Yea you give em a yard best forget the vig
Cause this ain't the next whomever i'ts the new kid
Let me see what you got baby open it up
If that's a big bag of money we be divvyin up
If that's a spliff in your mouth best be lightin it up
I need a drink cause the bass is spillin my cup
Let me see what you got baby open it up
If that's a big bag of money we be divvyin up
If that's a spliff in your mouth baby pass it up
I need a drink cause the bass is spillin my cup
Run Daddy run
Yea I fires them all but they be commin back
Run daddy run
Black trench and black hearts to match
Run daddy run
Yea give 'em a yard best forget the vig
Cause this ain't the next whomever i'ts the new kid
Run daddy run
