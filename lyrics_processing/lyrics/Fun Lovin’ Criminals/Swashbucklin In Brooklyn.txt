Sellin fish n chips and dealin bags of pot
Dressed in a pirates uniform and all
Lookin like a fool headin for a fall
He was walkin home late one night godbless
Heard the scream of a woman in immediate distress
??????
He headed down the alley hoping for the best
He saw the girl who was screamin her mouth beat shut
Two guys standin by her bout to get f*cked up
He said you don't hit the bitches while I'm still alive
Stabbed on in the neck the other in the eye
The girl ran home told her daddy she was saved
By a pirate with a shiv and a real smooth way
The vision of the pirate would surely never fade
So she called the New York post and tried to get paid
Chorus
Super hero your my super hero
Super hero your my super hero
Now the story ran the following day page two
But swashbucklin in Brooklyn is all he want to do
I tried to sit him down and think things through
But swashbucklin in Brooklyn is all he want to do
Now he was havin problems like diving without drowning
The city the cops the mob trying to stop him
He needed a psychic thats where I came in
Tell his story to the world help him with his shit
We cruise down the river patrolling the docks
Deliverin justice to eight square blocks
Brooklyn was safe nobody got shot
We used swords and daggers and kung fu what nots
This kinda shits ??? had no choice
Doin it for free like the village voice
This ends my first installment of the story
He was good kicking ass but bad with the glory
Chorus x 2
Super hero your my super hero
Super hero your my super hero
We cruise down the river patrolling the docks
Deliverin justice to eight square blocks
Brooklyn was safe nobody got shot
We used swords and daggers and kung fu what nots
This kinda shits ??? had no choice
Doin it for free like the village voice
This ends my first installment of the story
He was good kicking ass but bad with the glory
Chorus x 4
Super hero your my super hero
