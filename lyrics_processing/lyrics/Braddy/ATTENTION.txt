O-o-o-my gosh, Please don't let me start
On these trifling ass hoes who thinking that they stars
Swear she a ride or die bitch but ain't even got no car
They so hungry for attention, if they don't get it they go starve
But let that heifer tell it, she independent getting in her cheddar up
Thank everybody supposed to scared of her, Hot headed like the devil bra
Attitude is the worst, this bitch need to do better bra
She change her man like every season, she worst than the weather
Every other day a brand new picture of her ass
I wish a real lady would show these hoes how to have some class
Talking loud on the scene, causing scenes, and acting bad
These are just some of the things they be doing for that....

Verse (3)
I salute the real, middle finger to them fakes
In a world that full of rats, I'll take my chances with the snakes
Dressed in all black and in the back is where I stay
I be in the cut and attention is what I pay
Boy niggas out here wilding. And these attention hoes kill me
And most of the shit the doing is lame and I hope that they hear me
I don't care if you don't like it. Its too many folks who feel me
And I hope you getting offended, but don't make me hurt your feelings
I'm speaking in general to cadet I'm the lieutenant
How the fuck can you be a boss when you can't mind your business?
But looking for some problems over here and you going get it
All because you wanting some, all because you wanting some .......
