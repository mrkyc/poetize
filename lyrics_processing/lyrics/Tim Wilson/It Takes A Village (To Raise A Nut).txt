He blew up the trailer that he grew up in
Burnt down the church and the junior-high gym
His own momma wouldn't even claim him
But Hillary Clinton says we're to blame
She said the town oughta feel ashamed
We let Dwayne down when he needed us most
We'd pray for him if the church wasn't toasted soot
It takes a village to raise a nut
We rebuilt the gym at the junior-high school
Dwayne popped the lock with a tire tool
He blew out the windows with a pellet gun
And spray-painted some stuff about the coach's son
Albert Gore says he's appalled
Says Dwayne needs midnight basketball
We need to spend quality time with him
We'd play ball with him if the gym wasn't bolted shut
It takes a village to raise a nut

It takes a village to raise a nut

It takes a village to raise a nut
It take tires squeelin' around a Pizza Hut
It takes a momma and daddy sittin' on their butts
It takes a principal's office without any guts
It takes a sorry mayor and a school that sucks
It takes a lot of police and fire trucks
And a high school teacher who likes being kicked and cut
It takes a village to raise a nut

We finally snapped in our senior year
Got in the truck and drank some cold beer
Followed Dwayne home from his senior prom
All the way back to his foster home
His foster mom let us in the door
Said she couldn't deal with Dwayne no more
Ripped a $40 tux right off of him
When we finished with him, his jaw was wired shut
It takes a village to raise a nut
