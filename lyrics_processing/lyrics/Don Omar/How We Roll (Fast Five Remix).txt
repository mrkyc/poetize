Don Omar, J-Doe, Reek da Villan, Bus-a-Bus
Come on, come on

That's how we roll, we roll like this

Now, now, now, now, now
Ya'll know what we do, ya'll know exactly how we rollin'
And we huggin' every block, don't matter how police patrol it
If we do it how we do it whether it's now or it's later
And we always handle business cause we 'bout gettin' this paper
What you want?, what you need?, as we walk through every gutter
Every hood and every street and every block we got it covered
Throwin' money while we in the club with shorties on our pole
Let's get it poppin' in this bitch, me and my clique comin' through
That's how we

Hoppin' in any vehicle I choose
I get up in that 'Vet and start it all you hear is vrooom
Roarin' up the engine 'till it blew like a balloon
Light my dutch hit the clutch throw it in the gear and peeew
Ridin' in the fast cars, drivin' like it's NASCAR
Tearing up the asphalt when I'm in that Jaguar
Dippin' away from Nason, redlinin' the dash board
Exhaust blowin' fire like a rocket 'bout to blast off, fast yo

Yeah, yeah, J-Doe, I rock'em
You know how we roll (Roll), you know how we do it (Do it)
You know we the realest when it come to doin' music
Don't wanna see me prove it, baby, if I gotta lose it
Then it's on turn ya radio on, you gon hear the newest
J-Doe spit hate on this, why the hell you doin' that
How the hell you be a loser hatin' on me, I'm the best
I be pissin' on competition if there's any give me more my flows
Or let me get me used up fork, don't need a Jimmy and Newegie boys

That's how we roll, we roll like this
We roll like this, let me talk to'em
Here we go here, we here we go again
Pedal to the metal, now we blowin' in the wind
Top back, nigga, better stop that
If you tryna front, you already know, we killers to the end
Everyday we gotta go secure another win
Put that money where ya mouth will spend
Let's get it poppin', everybody know that
When we in the buildin', here we go again
Couple Porsches, couple Bugatti's, Phantoms
Derek, Lam', Lenches, couple of Maybachs
Suited and booted, SLR McLaren, Benzes
Rollin' see the way we holdin', see the money foldin'
Everybody see the way we hit it, chosen when we hit the road and
Everthing is golden, ya'll already know how we get it (through)
Peel out on they ass, 160 read on the dash
Hand on the wheel and my feet on the gas (Conglomerate!) got everything on smash
Don know Moles kid, Reek da Vill', J-Doe weee
See the way we do it, see the way we cut up
Put ya money where ya mouth is or shut up
Legal shots, everybody in the place, let me see you put ya gun up
We gon pop ready, if you ready, ya'll already know to where we run up
When we come to take over the streets, ya'll niggas know the goal
Every time we put it down, the whole world knows that's how we
