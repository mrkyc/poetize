The coldest peak, I feel it now, I'm looking down
Your face to me and I see red in melody
Come and back me up, but what's that, baby?
All my love, feel it close, it's close enough
The greatest view, the greatest view, is you, baby

'Cause I've been there before
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine

All I see, is that final piece, it's easy prey
At my back, feel it close, it's close enough
'Cause I've been there before
When all my love fills out my eyes, strangles me weak
The greatest view, straight to my chest, is you, baby

'Cause I've been there before
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
'Cause I've been there before
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
'Cause I've been there before
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
Yes, I'll be fine, I know I'll be fine
