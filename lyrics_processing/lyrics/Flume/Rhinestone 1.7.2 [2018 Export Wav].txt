Why don't I go back to life in
This relationship, I'm asking
For your undivided attention
Trust in all that we started

Tex Mex and blue jeans
Watch you on the wide screen
Your heart, like a rhinestone
Just tryna stay alive
Would you be a man?
I thought that I should let you know

I'm blushin', I'm still in love (Be your girl, be your girl)
More than in love
I'm blushin', is this real enough? (Oh, I could be your girl, be your girl)
You're like a flashlight, flickin' on, flickin' off
I'm blushin', I'm waitin' up (Be your girl, be your girl)
Until you come
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Oh, I could be your girl, be your girl)
You're like a flashlight, flickin' on, flickin' off

Pick me up some time in the morning
Still before the sun is dawning
Moonflower, call me your moonflower
Treat me kind, I'll bloom forever
