Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell square in the frosty air
What a bright time it's the right time to rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time to go glidin' in a one horse sleigh
Giddyup jingle horse pick up your feet jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a jinglin' beat that's the jingle bell rock
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "Be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
When friends come to call
It's the hap- happiest season of all
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories of
Christmases long, long ago
It's the most wonderful time of the year
