Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worth while
If you just
Light up your face with sadness
Hide every trace of gladness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile what the use in crying
You'll find that life is still worth while
If you just smile
Though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worth while
If you just smile
That's the time you must keep
Smile what's the use in crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
