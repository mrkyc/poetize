(there gonna missed me when i'm gone baby)

(Verse 1: Intellegentz)
Hello
Man they don't understand me
from i know
i must be from another planet
feeling like a freak show
that's why i disconnect go Incognito
i need to breath cuz i'm going crazy
Hello
Man they don't understand me
from i know
i must be from another planet
feeling like a freak show
that's why i disconnect go Incognito
they gonna miss me when i'm gone baby
(Verse 2: Intellegentz)
there's no copies
i'm a black sheep in a white body
riding shottie in a black jeep
in a white body in a highway
full of all audis i'm different
what's in the jug
that i'm sipping
man they wanted to be pour
into there esophogus
all in there nervous system
but listen
just cause it ruins
deep in my veins
that don't mean that
you can achieve
all the things that
i gained with
copy & paste
now get outta my lane
error 4 zero 4
i'm running from norm,
run into the storm
while the swarm
running for it moral
is i'm outside the box
never conforming
not  an optimist or
a pessimist
i'm a realist that's my deal is
that's glass it just half
on the way to empty, that's facts
and there ain't no other way
to cut it
because they told you something
different
you can't think above it?
man tell em  all
Shove it
(Chorus: Intellegentz)
Hello
Man they don't understand me
from i know
i must be from another planet
feeling like a freak show
that's why i disconnect go Incognito
i need to breath cuz i'm going crazy
Hello
Man they don't understand me
from i know
i must be from another planet
feeling like a freak show
that's why i disconnect go Incognito
they gonna miss me when i'm gone baby
(Verse 2: Dennis)
i'm not the one that you see
way in the beach  of the screen
shootin' the breeze
they gave me different genes
i'm the one stealing the scene
that's me
sitting in the front seat
of the taxi
backstreet's
back blasting
that's me
tapping my feet to the beat
while the driver like woah! that's
real distracting!
but i'mma die happy with a few dope songs
and a nice clean wrap sheet
they could bash me
all they want but the one thing
they'll never dd's catch up
or match me
krypto in a pound full of lassies
bright shining diamond i'm a trash heap
i been elevating' heavily
i leveled up eleven levels
ever since last week
you never could pass me
and i'll never let 'em derail  or distract me
or let 'em get at me
they way that you see me's
irrelevant actually
so sit with the rest the the scrap heat
or live in perpetual bad dreams
my confidence level is bigger than shaq's feet
that's huge exactly
(Outro: Intellegentz and Dennis)
