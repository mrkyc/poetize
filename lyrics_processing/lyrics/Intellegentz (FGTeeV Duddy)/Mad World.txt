This week I had to think of something different
See I watched a couple of videos recently
It got me real mad
Particularly about bullying
Like the seven news that jumped this one cab in Chicago
It made me think about everything I hate about this world
I'm bout' to rap about it
Yeah
Yeah
Hey yo
I'm sick of all the bullying
Fake gangs and cowards
Slick pulling wool over eyes
But they ain't ours
Suicide times young lives gettin' devoured
It's sour and now I'm wishing I had the power
To stop it and put it in a box and then lock it in
No poppin' holes I'm not givin' it oxygen
Suffocate a rapist arsonist get a taste
Of the fire that I will place in that
Child molestors face when I
Burn em' at the stake if they even catching that thought
Castrate em' like a dog, beat a thief till' he robbed
Of dignity getting throbbed infinitely beating y'all
The world's hittin' a wall so start admittin' and halt
There's a change needed don't remain seated
Spittin' flames rip it with game
Until your brain heed it
Man beat it
Yeah I'm talking to thugs drunks abusers
Bad parents that lack caring and love losers
Your kids might choose to hate you in the future
But I ain't a judge only God can execute ya'
And to the
Corruptors and the polluters
Government and state legislators yeah I dispute ya'
This madness will make me glad if 2012 happens
Cause' I can't fathom all the kids that starving so I'm being saddened
Imagine if that was your world
You'd want to end too
Nobody befriend you not enough food to send through
Nobody working magic while cancer is spreading tragic
Tell me what is the answer to the problem of sex traffic
Quit talking junk on Facebook
Cyber bullying's raised up
I think we need a 2nd 9/11 for us to shape up
Now stop the assault unplug the battery
Is that so bad if we get along unite happily
Actively set it straight
I'm praying for better days

Tell him I said to resonate
