The grass is greener on the other side
But that's a lie
Now who don't wanna be the cool kid
Fresh pair of kicks popular school kid
All things hot from the top to the socks
At the bus stop
Flock full of friends but watch
When they go home no love is shown
They feel all alone as opposed
To the child who feels like their life
Is missing something
But maybe it wasn't
There's one thing that you gotta know
Everybody has a story to be told
Yeah that's so
So try not to judge a book by its cover kid
If you start reading
You'll discover something under it
That you may not like
So it's not right to compare lifes
You don't know the fight they goin' through
Cause you ain't right there in they shoes
I'm certain that everybody hurtin' behind their curtain
If you took a step today a breath today
Well that's a blessin' ya' gotta give thanks
If you got food on your plate
Don't matter that it's not filet
Cause some ain't eating at all
Worried the house in you sleep in is small
When you got shelter & heat
Others all curled up in a ball
Cause someone will always have more
But no one has all
You might also likeThey say
The grass ain't always greener on the other side
And yeah that's right
So always
Go on live your life
Keep your future bright
Don't give up the fight
Now who don't wanna be balling
Thinkin' that money make stress all end
Let's use the example a wife and husband
Got bills up in debt negative abundance
But let's say one day
He get a promotion come with increased pay
But now he's not home he's away
Working nights late
When his kids wanna play
Either way there will always be pain
There can't be flowers without rain
When the showers come again
Increase the power of your flame
If you can dream it and you believe it
Then you can achieve it
Don't give in to weakness
Cause it's not about falling down
It's about getting back up when it counts
Winners never quit
And quitters never win
If your grass ain't green enough
Then water it again
Water it again water it again
Don't stop watering until your life ends
Might be hard at the bottom when you try to float
No matter the problems gotta find hope
Live every day like it's the last
Your life is yours you color the grass
(turn it up!)
They say
The grass is greener on the other side
But that's a lie
So always live your life don't let it fly by
Worrying about the other side
Other side
