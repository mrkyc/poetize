(Hey, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry Darling?)

Your Mamma's yappin' in the back seat
Tell her to push over and move them big feet
Every Monday morning I gotta drive her down to the unemployment agency
Well this morning I ain't fighting, tell her I give up
Tell her she wins if she'll just shut up
But it's the last time that she's gonna be ridin' with me

And you can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the black top
She keeps talkin', she'll be walking that last block
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight
Well, I got some beer and the highway's free
And I got you, and baby, you've got me
Hey, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry Darling?

Now there's girls melting on the beach
Oh they're so fine and so out of reach
'Cause I'm stuck in traffic down here on 53rd Street
Now Sherry, my love for you is real
But I didn't count on this package deal
And baby, this car just ain't big enough for her and me
See Bruce Springsteen LiveGet tickets as low as $28You might also like
So you can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the blacktop
She keeps talking, she'll be walkin' that last block
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight
Well, I got some beer and the highway's free
And I got you, and baby, you've got me
Hey, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry Darling?
(Let go!)


Well, let there be sunlight, let there be rain
Let my broken heart love again
Sherry, we can run with our arms open wide before the tide
To all the girls down at Sacred Heart
And all you operators back in the Park
Say hey, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry Darling?

Whoa whoa, right
Say, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry Darling?
Oh, come on
Say, hey, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry Darling?
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra)
(Da-ra-ra-ra, da-ra, da-ra, da-ra, da-ra, oh)
(Da da da da, da-ra-ra-ra-ra, da-ra)
(Da da, da-ra-ra-ra-ra, da-ra)

(Da-ra-ra, da-ra-ra)
