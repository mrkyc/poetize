I got no time for the corner boys
Down in the street makin' all that noise
Or the girls out on the avenue
'Cause tonight I wanna be with you

Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Across the river to the Jersey side
Take my baby to the carnival
And I'll take her on all the rides

'Cause down the shore everything's all right
You and your baby on a Saturday night
Well, you know all my dreams come true
When I'm walkin' down the street with you

Sing sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la
Sha la la, la la la la la
Sha la la la, I'm in love with a Jersey girl
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la
Sha la la, la la la la la
Sha la la la la la

You know she thrills me with all her charms
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms
My little girl gives me everything
I know some day that she'll wear my ring

So don't bother me, man, I ain't got no time
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine
'Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la
Sha la la, la la la la
Sha la la la, I'm in love with a Jersey girl
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la
Sha la la, la la la la la
Sha la la la la la

I see you on the street and you look so tired
Girl, I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired
When I come by to take you out to eat
You're lyin' all dressed up on the bed, baby, fast asleep
Well, go in the bathroom and put your makeup on
We're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom's
I know a place where the dancing's free
Now baby, won't you come with me?

'Cause down the shore everything's all right
You and your baby on a Saturday night
Nothing matters in this whole wide world, now girl, now now
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

Sha la la la la, la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la la, la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la
Sha la la la, I'm in love with a Jersey girl
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la
Sha la la, la la la la la
