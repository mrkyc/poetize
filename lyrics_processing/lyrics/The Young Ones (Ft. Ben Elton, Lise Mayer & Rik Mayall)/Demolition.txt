DJ: That was a great new version of "The Young Ones"--

RICK: That was brilliant! Shame about Cliff Richard.
NEIL: What about him?
RICK: What?
NEIL: What about Cliff Richard?
RICK: Are you trying to be funny?
NEIL: Um, uh...
RICK: Because if you are, I think it's in pretty poor taste, that's all! I'm not a fridge, you know!

NEIL: Weird, eh? I better get back to the lentil cassarole before I get disorientated.

NEIL: Guess it'll be soon be over for you lentils!

NEIL: Oh wow! This is really amazingly hot! I'd better get it to the table quickly!
NEIL: Oh, no room at all, eh? Heavy! I'll never get it back to the cooker in time now--I'm just gonna have to--

NEIL: Oh no. Bad karma. Again!

NEIL: Guys, there's some dinner on the floor if you want it. If you don't, like, that would also be cool, because I only spent all day cooking it, right, and like, I was the one who got it together to put the lentils on to soak last night, but maybe we should just get a cat, right, and give it to the cat, 'cause it's obvious none of you can be both-- guys? Maybe it'd be cool if I just died, right?

RICK: Well?
NEIL: Well what, Rick?
RICK: Have you decided to apologize for what you said about Cliff Richard?
NEIL: I didn't say anything about Cliff Richard, Rick, I wasn't even--
RICK: Look, I don't want to discuss it! Okay? Ha-- I wouldn't even discuss the color of orange juice with you, Neil. Heh! But I've written a poem and I think perhaps it might help you.
NEIL: It's orange, Rick, and look, I don't want to depress you or anything, but like, you're standing in a huge mound of lentil cassarole.
RICK: "Oh Cliff! / Sometimes it must be difficult not to feel as if / You really are a cliff / When fascists keep trying to push you over it! / Are they the lemmings, or are you Cliff? Or ARE you, Cliff?
NEIL: Yeah. That was really pretty bad, Rick.
RICK: Bad for society when the KIDS start to get into it!
NEIL: I'm gonna kill myself now.
RICK: Pretty angry stuff, right? Let them try and ignore that, right?

RICK: Those clever trousers in the army! And the police, and the government, if they can!
NEIL: I see things much more clearly now! Bye Rick.
RICK: Yes, g'bye.
NEIL: I'll probably come back as a lentil.
RICK: I might even be put in prison! And have water DRIPPED on my head! I might even get a personal message from Cliff!
NEIL: Oh, wow! This is the end, man! Doesn't anybody ever suss out cleaning this oven except me? Aw, w--this is so dirty, man, uncool! I bet you could look inside all the dirty ovens in the world, right, and you can--even the ones at the bottoms of swamps, and you wouldn't find one as dirty as this one.
RICK: Neil! Why don't you listen to me, Neil? Why don't you listen to ME? Y--d'you find me boring or something? Look. Look. That's a saucer. THAT'S boring. Look.

RICK: Pretty different, really, isn't it? It's not really the same thing at all, is it Neil? NEIL!

RICK: I will not be associated with saucers!
MIKE: Hi guys! 6:15, enter Mike the cool person for his dinner. Strolls across the floor, "Hi Neil," he says, looking good and already warming up "Is that supper?"
NEIL: No, no, that's supper over there.
MIKE: Why are you smashing up saucers, Rick? Your prints on 'em? I know just how you feel, man, y'dig? Sometimes saucers used to make me pretty angry too. Yeah, there's a lotta heads buried at the bottom of the garden because of a saucer in the works.
RICK: I suppose you think it's pretty weird, don't you Mike? Well. You'd be right. 'Cause THAT'S the kind of guy I am, right? WEIRD. Which is why I go over people's heads! A bit like an aeroplane! You think I'm an aeroplane, don't you, Mike? Well, I'm not.
MIKE: I don't think you're an aeroplane, Rick.
RICK: Sycophant!

NEIL: Guys, I really think we ought to get it together maybe to eat something, you know?
RAT #1: Oh zounds! Most I can manage these days is to stuff down a few pages of the Guardian before they're ripped out!
RAT #2: I managed to nibble away at a few lines of Hippolytus the other day, at #32.
RAT #1: Oh, lucky you! Eurypides is my dream poet. {mumbles somtething unintelligible}

RAT #2: Oh, wonderful! This should raise a dry smile, then: Knock knock!
RAT #1: Oh, how wonderful! Who's there?
RAT #2: Eurypides!
RAT #1: Eurypides who?
RAT #2: Eurypides trousers, you-menda-these trousers!

RICK: Augh! A rat!

NEIL: Oh, wow, Rick, man, that's really heavy, man! My grandfather made that guitar entirely out of matchsticks on his deathbed!
RICK: I hate rats! OKAY?

RAT #2: It's what he would have wanted.
NEIL: Eh, look, guys, eh, I'm sorry the meal got a bit uncool, like, floorwise, but it's all right, cause I probably got the dirtiest bit.

RICK: Ha ha ha!
MIKE: Okay, guys, don't do anything unusual. Did a guy with a lisp phone?
RICK: No one phoned you, Mike. Well... we haven't got a telephone.
MIKE: Yeah. I know. But did a guy with a lisp phone?
RICK: No, he didn't.
MIKE: Did he say anything about the bananas?
RICK: Uh... no.
MIKE: I thought you said he didn't phone!
RICK: He didn't!
MIKE: Okay, okay, that's good. But it could have been very bad! Anyway, forget you rever even heard the name.
RICK: Uh... What name?
MIKE: Hey, hey, you're learning! That's good.
NEIL: I've got an uncle called Dustin.
RICK: Neil! Are these lentils South African?
NEIL: Well, um...
RICK: You bastard! You complete and utter bastard! Why don't you just go out and become a policeman?! Become a pig? There's no difference, you know!

RICK: Ow, ow, ow! There's no difference, you know! You think there is, but there isn't! I suppose you hate gay people too! Hippie!
NEIL: Listen, listen, just don't bring me down again, all right, Rick?
RICK: Okay, where's my biro? WHERE IS MY BIRO?
MIKE: Here, here, use mine.

RICK: This is my biro!
MIKE: Well, I just saw it lying on your desk, I thought you didn't want it anymore.
RICK: But look at it, it's half empty!
MIKE: It was just lying there, Rick, what's a guy supposed to think?
RICK: Neil! / What are you doing, Neil? / To make a meal, Neil? / Surreal! From totalitarian vegetables! / How much does it cost, Neil?
NEIL: Well actually it's about four pounds fifty, each.
MIKE and RICK: Four pounds fifty??
RICK: I'm not paying you money to eat black men! I could become a pig and do that for free! Right on!
MIKE: Neil, when I eat a meal worth four pounds fifty, I'm not paying for it, you got me?
NEIL: Yeah, okay, okay, right, like house meeting, okay? Yeah. Like, I know four pounds fifty is like a hell of a lot of bread to lay out just for a lentil casserole, but I did a lot, right? And it struck me that like, considering what I'm gonna do, tonight, I should do like, thirteen portions.
RICK: Thirteen? What are you doing, starting a football team?
NEIL: No, no, killing myself! Killing myself. This is my last supper, right. I've finished building my gallows, and it's totally far out, you should see it Rick. Like, when the trap door opens, and I, like, die, it lights Joss Sticks and plays "Rock Around The Clock"; it's totally amazing.
RICK: Oh, far out. Really great. WOODSTOCK.

NEIL: Oh, fine, great, yeah. Why don't you sit in the supper, man, yeah.
RICK: Vyvyan, you might have washed ye hands!

VYVYAN: I've been down the morgue!
NEIL: Oh, fine, yeah, great. Let's talk about death, I mean, don't consider my feelings tonight, or anything, really.
VYVYAN: Cutting up bodies for my course, you know.
RICK: None of you ever give the slightest consideration to a word I've said!
VYVYAN: That's because you're very boring!
RICK: Oh! Oh, and I suppose you think ideas like peace and freedom and equality are boring too!
VYVYAN: Yes, they are!
RICK: Ha! Fallen into my trap! In that case, why isn't Cliff Richard boring, clever-trousers? Tell me that!

NEIL: Okay, lads, umm... this is it, okay, I'm going, now, this is the final moment, okay? Right.
VYVYAN: I've got a leg.
MIKE: Hey Vyvyan, that's not unusual.
VYVYAN: No, look. I'm supposed to write an essay on it, right, but... I think I'm just gonna stick it on the bonnet of my car!
NEIL: Bye, then!
MIKE: Okay, Vyv, okay, hold back, go previous. Now, the scotch eggs are another story. That's a nice angle on the wall, straight through it, I like your style. Certainly had me fooled. That's only part of the puzzle. Most days you come through the door. Sometimes you even open it. Today you didn't, today you suddenly change your routine, why? Eh? You in trouble, Vyv? You the final sausage in the fridge? Is someone comin' after you with a piece of cling film?
VYVYAN: No... We got a letter from the council! Look, nobody's fed my hamster, have they?

NEIL: Um... Look, I'll see you on the other side, okay, lads? This is really it, I'm going, okay?
MIKE: Yeah, yeah, see you, Neil.
VYVYAN: Yeah, bye, Neil.
NEIL: And um, you can forget about the bread, okay, man?
MIKE: Hey, listen, it's just like going to sleep, okay?
NEIL: But I'm an insomniac, Mike.
MIKE: So what are you worried about?
NEIL: Oh yeah, thanks. Thanks, Mike, bye.
VYVYAN: Look. Nobody's fed Special Patrol Group, have they?
MIKE: Listen, Vyv--this letter: you're sure it wasn't a packing case? Or maybe a tea chest with Zurich stamped on it?
VYVYAN: No, a letter!
RICK: I think "Special Patrol Group" is a stupid name for a hamster!
VYVYAN: Okay, I'll change it, then! Hello, Cliff Richard!
RICK: Bastard!

VYVYAN: Aaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! Aaaah!

RICK: Oh, thanks a lot, Vyvyan! You know I'm a vegetarian!
MIKE: Vyvyian! I really think you ought to feed that hamster more often!
VYVYAN: Look, I don't want to spoil him, okay?
MIKE: But he looks like Tesco's when the beans are reduced!

VYVYAN: It looks well on him, though, doesn't he?

--INT: BASEMENT
S.P.G.: Whoa! I could murder a curry.

I think they are F-A-B, that's English for "stupid!", yeah! Okay, fantastic! Hey, Mikey, look! Here, I have some Coca-Cola, yes? We have party, yes? Okay, let's dance, let's do the fog! You know, I am liking very much your Harold MacMillan; thanks to him, I am never having it, yeah!
RICK: Mr. Balowski! We have residents rights, you know! You're supposed to knock!
BALOWSKI: Listen, don't you think it's a nice house, here? Is good house, is clean house, Michael Caine and Twiggy, yes? So maybe sometime you would like to pay me some rent, then we go down milk bar for soda pop, you shovel, yes?
MIKE: Listen, Jerzy...
BALOWSKI: Jeremy, actually.
MIKE: Jeremy. Listen, if you're worried about the rent, I've got that sussed. Gentlemen, house meeting, in the hall, two seconds, be there!

BALOWSKI: Back to the actin'.
MIKE: Okay, Jerzy.
BALOWSKI: Yes?
MIKE: About the rent.
BALOWSKI: Yes?
MIKE: Oh, I nearly forgot. These two men wanted to see you.
BALOWSKI: Two men, Morcambe and Wise, yes? Funny comedians with the wigs and the buckets of water, yes?
MIKE: Oh, no, no, no... they said they were with the Moscow Dynamos ice hockey squad, eh? I told 'em I'd never heard of you, said I'd never seen you before.
BALOWSKI: Okay, I say is good--is good joke, yes? Is earthy English humor, yes? Like seaside postcard from Leicester, yes?
MIKE: Yeah, yeah, so. So we'll forget about the rent, we'll pay you another time, is that cool?
BALOWSKI: Yes, that's absolutely icebox! See you later, Ford Anglia!

RICK: I hate him! Do you think he really is British?
VYVYAN: Well he knows a lot about the Mersey sound.
RICK: Shut up! I'm trying to stir my coffee!
VYVYAN: No, listen! We got a letter from the council! They're going to demolish the house tomorrow!

MIKE: But I was going to turn it into an entertainment complex! This room's a roller disco! Hey! I'm depressed! It's Nine Below Zero!

RICK: He's blummin' right, you know!

MIKE: How can they, i.e. the Council, destroy the house of Mike?

RICK: Will you stop it, Vyvyan!
VYVYAN: Listen! If we don't smash the house up, the council are gonna demolish it, tomorrow!
MIKE: He's right, you know. They're gonna knock the house down tomorrow.
RICK: That's all very well! But finally, after years of stagnation, the TV people have woken up to the need for locally-based minority programs! Made by amateurs! And perhaps of interest only to two or three people! It's important, right? It's now! And I want to watch!
