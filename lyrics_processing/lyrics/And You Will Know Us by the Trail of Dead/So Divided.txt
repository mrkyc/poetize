Let's gather everyone
And go see what they're
Up to now
Driving in, Driving out
From hotel to the bar
All our friends are here
But somehow we seem so divided
We're the voice crying out
Screaming every song
Not that anyone understands
Diving in, Diving out
The terrified crowd
All our bands are here
But somehow they seem so divided
If you want to see where the fight is
Look around...
I hear the sound of a voice inside my head
Saying things that I can't understand
Telling me a life may soon be dead I wonder from what hand
The words they say are too hard to conceive
I try my best to never listen
Can't you see I'm struggling to conceal
These thoughts from everyone?
It's not that I don't care
And I don't want to hurt you
It's just the worst I fear is coming out
Coming out of me
You might also likeYou know I've heard you say that I'm not real
I know you think that I don't understand
Truth is I'm trying hard to deal
This is not what I had planned
It's not that I don't care
It's not that I don't love you
It's just that I am here
To put you out of your misery
All of you lovers who think you're in love
I'll put you out of your misery
All of your children born under the sky
I'll put you out of your misery
Venom that you can't conceive
Is pouring out of the depths of me
You think you're free, you've been deceived
I'll put you out of your misery
You think the future is warm and bright
But it is death and I am your destiny
You think you'll be protected by God
I'll put you out of your misery
