Love can go to your head
Like a shot of something strong
Love can go to your bed
And stay there all night long
Love can go on and on
Like a Sunday morning Sparrow
Love can go to your heart
Like a sweet talking arrow

Love can go to hell in a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
Oh but love, yeah, love can go to hell

I can go to church
Fold these idle hands
I can go to work
Call some friends
Make some plans
I can get drunk on a Saturday night
And try to fall for someone new
But I'd just wake up hungover
Cursing the day I fell for you
You might also like
Love can go to hell in a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well


I don't blame you at all
No, I don't hate you at all
It's all love's fault

So, love can go to hell in a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
Oh but love, yeah, love can go to hell
Forever's just a lie that love will tell
