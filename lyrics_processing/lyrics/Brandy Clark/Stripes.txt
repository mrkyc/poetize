Woah, woah, woah, woah

You were lyin' there with nothing on
But a goofy little grin and a platinum blonde
I can't believe you'd do that on our bed
I got a pistol and I got a bullet
And a pissed off finger just itchin' to pull it
The only thing keepin' me from losin' my head

Is I hate stripes and orange ain't my color
And if I squeeze that trigger tonight
I'll be wearin' one or the other
There's no crime of passion worth a crime of fashion
The only thing savin' your life
Is that I don't look good in orange and I hate stripes

Woah, woah, woah

I could fall in love with a prison guard
I could sell cigarettes in the prison yard
Don't think hard time would be that hard on me
I could pick up trash on the side of the road
But I'd die if I saw someone I know
Ain't the chains, it's the clothes that's stoppin' me
You might also like
I hate stripes and orange ain't my color
And if I squeeze that trigger tonight
I'll be wearin' one or the other
There's no crime of passion worth a crime of fashion
The only thing savin' your life
Is that I don't look good in orange and I hate stripes

Oh, and one shot ain't worth a bad mugshot
God knows I wouldn't be caught holdin' up a number
While the whole town's starin' at the picture
In the paper of me wearin' stripes

There's no crime of passion worth a crime of fashion
The only thing savin' your life
Is that I don't look good in orange and I hate stripes
And orange ain't my color
And if I squeeze that trigger tonight
I'll be wearin' one or the other
There's no crime of passion worth a crime of fashion
The only thing savin' your life
Is that I don't look good in orange and I hate stripes
