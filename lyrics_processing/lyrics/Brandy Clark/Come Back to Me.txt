If there's sand that you ain't wrote your name in
If you're tired of the view from the same window
If there's lips that you wanna get drunk on
Ferris wheels that you need to get stuck on, go
See everything you think you need to see
Then come back to me

If there's pavement you ain't put your shoes on
Or a dance floor you ain't made a move on yet
And if you're feelin' too safe here beside me
And you wanna do something you might regret
Try the whole world on if you feel the need
Then come back to me

I wouldn't want you to miss a thing
I wouldn't wake you from any dream you've ever had
So go on and go and unroll every map
If you gotta leave, you gotta know
I love you enough to let you go
If there's greener grass
Hey I wanna hold you but I don't wanna hold you back

If you fly like a bird on the jet stream
Hope the sky is a Hollywood set scene blue
If you land with a tan and your shades on
Hope the promise the postcard made comes true
But if it's not all you dreamed it'd be
Come on back to me
You might also like
I wouldn't want you to miss a thing
I wouldn't wake you from any dream you've ever had
So go on and go and unroll every map
But if you gotta leave, you gotta know
I love you enough to let you go
If there's greener grass
Hey I wanna hold you but I don't want to hold you back

If you find someone else who deserves you
Hope she loves you enough not to hurt you
But if she does you know right where I'll be
