Do you have a favorite song? Do you have a greatest fear?
Do you have an angel and a devil who whisper in your ear?
What's your worst day ever? While you're at it, what's your best?
Do you think it's one big accident or maybe one big test?

Do you say your mama's prayer or do you hold your daddy's grudge?
Are you a little more revenge or do you lean more into love?
Do you have that one regret or do you have a few?
Yeah, me too

You got a heart like mine and it's shaped like mine
It's hard like mine, so it breaks like mine
It's strong like mine, gets it wrong like mine
So forgive that I forget sometimes
Yours is just like mine
Your heart is just like mine

Here we go again, at each other's throats
Hellbent on where we are, scared of what the future holds
You say that it is, I say that it ain't
We get hung up on the different, but one thing remains the same
You might also like
You've got a heart like mine and it's shaped like mine
It's hard like mine, so it breaks like mine
It's strong like mine, gets it wrong like mine
So forgive that I forget sometimes
Yours is just like mine
Yeah, your heart is just like mine

Show me your white flag and then let me show you mine
We'll see what's underneath our pockets and beating right in time

You got a heart like mine, it's shaped like mine
It's hard like mine, so it breaks like mine
It's strong like mine, gets it wrong like mine
So forgive that I forget sometimes
(Forgive that I forget)

You got a heart like mine, it's shaped like mine
It's hard like mine, so it breaks like mine
It's strong like mine, gets it wrong like mine
So forgive that I forget sometimes (Forgive that I forget)
Yours is just like mine (You got a heart like mine)
Your heart is just like mine (Heart like mine)
Yeah, it's just like mine (Heart like mine)
(Heart like mine)
