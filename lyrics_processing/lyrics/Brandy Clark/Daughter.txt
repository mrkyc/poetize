When you broke my heart, I wanted to
Cut the brake line on your four-wheel drive
And poison your Pabst Blue Ribbon
When you drug my name all through the mud
I was dying to do the same, but I held my tongue
'Cause that ain't Christian

And you might be laughing now
But what goes around comes around

So I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
Daddy's little girl, just as sweet as she is hot
She can't help but love them boys who love to love
And leave them girls just like her father
Yeah, karma's a bitch
So I hope you have a daughter

When them boys pick her up wearing cheap cologne
Younger versions of yourself, so you'll know when they drive off
What they're thinking
You had some real good lines and they will too
I bet you'll have a come-to-Jesus when they're being used
On your baby
You might also like
And you'll wanna kick their ass
But hey, pot, that kettle's black

So I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
And you get a little grayer every time you hear a knock
She can't help but love them boys who love to love
And leave them girls just like her father
Yeah, karma's a bitch
So I hope you have a daughter

Yeah, it kind of makes me sad
That she'll be the one to get you back

But I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
Daddy's little girl, just as sweet as she is hot
She can't help but love them boys who love to love
And leave them girls just like her father
Yeah, karma's a bitch
So I hope you have a daughter
You son of a bitch
