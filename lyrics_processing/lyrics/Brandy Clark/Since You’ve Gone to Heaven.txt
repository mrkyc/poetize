Since you've gone to Heaven, I don't like coming home
But I can't stand the thought of Mom in that big house alone
She can't keep it up, she really ought to sell
Oh that house without you in it is nothing but a shell
Since you've gone to Heaven, the whole world's gone to Hell

Everybody says that Billy is looking more and more like you
But he won't talk about you until he's had a few
He dropped out of college, he's in and out of jail
Had to pawn your pocket watch last month to post his bail
Since you've gone to Heaven, the whole world's gone to Hell

And I hate you had to leave us, but glad you didn't live to see this
The broken pieces of the family you made
Mama's looking so much older, baby brother can't stay sober
I bet you're rolling over in your grave

Since you've gone to Heaven, they shut the sawmill down
Guys you worked for thirty years with have all moved out of town
There's signs in every store front, seems like everything's for sale
They say the market's bouncing back, but it's sure hard to tell
Since you've gone to Heaven, the whole world's gone to Hell
You might also like
And I hate you had to leave us, but glad you didn't live to see this
The broken pieces of the Norman Rockwell days
The banks are taking over, half the town is in foreclosure
I bet you're rolling over in your grave

Since you've gone to Heaven, I've struggled with goodbye
And broke a lot of promises I made the day you died
Wish I was more like you, less like myself
And I wish that I could talk to you 'cause I could use your help
