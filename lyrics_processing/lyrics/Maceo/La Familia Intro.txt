I'm shooting dices, and putting in work
Don't want no 
Me and my niggas
We chop it up, we eating 
Count 7 figures
We in apartments
Chilling daily
We hide from 12
We hide the pack
We hide the 
We hide the bails
These niggas hate, these niggas watching
I know they plotting
To stop the move, we La Familia
We locked and loaded
Niggas talking brazy

My nigga Maceo a soldier
We serve them bolders
My circle locked in tight, we taking over
Got packs flying 20 east all out on

We locked in and loaded
Fuck them niggas, expose them
Lil Mexico taking over
 bolder
Submarines on the water
Million dollar shipments, plug tought me to stay focused
I die for my brothers
All we got is each other
Slice a nigga neck and mail his head to his mother
Posted up on 954, 'cause in 94, we was selling dope
You  found nigga, so don't act like you niggas know
We slung dope on boulevard, down the street from the precinct
Larry Gary had the trap house, yellow house right across the street
 had cliantell, all we did was break down slabs
Big mail, had to bullshit

I got more jewelry than you got money, pussy, I can show it
I ball everyday, you know I can afford it
I get money everyday, nothing else is important
30,000 a month
Drinking lean
Another 20 I throw away, selling hoes dreams
I love to flex, I take the scene
This ain't no flex, it's just my work ain't clean
Tripple beam, press down on the rerock machine
Built a house off all the blue hundreds, I got tired of green
La Familia, Maceo, Mexico, Marco, Casino
Future too, boss meeting at the round table
Da Kid!
Trapping up in designer
Nothing but racks in my pocket
I get money on a daily basis
I ain't heard of none of you niggas

Long as the packs is raw, I ain't scared to spend it

All my niggas sell drugs
Swagged up, looking like the plug
