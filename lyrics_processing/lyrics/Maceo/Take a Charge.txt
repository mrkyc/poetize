FBG
Yeah, yeah

I got too much money on me, and I'm knowin'
I just bust another play, and fucked his broad
I got a fuck with her, 'cause she'll take a charge
Yeah, I gotta fuck with her, 'cause she'll take a charge
I just crunk my whip, and did not use a key
And just to get it first, they had to charge a extra fee
I don't give a fuck, a bitch, she gotta take a charge
I don't give a fuck, I want it, I'm a get the charge

I fuck with her, 'cause she gon' take the charge, 'cause she solid
I'm juugin in the hood, til I get that new Bughatti
She a gutter bitch, ratchet bitch
And she'll slap a bitch, for all that acting shit
I crunk up my car, and I ain't even need a key
I remember when I used to dream about them keys
But call me Locksmith, 'cause I keep them on me
My Mexican connect, he drop them off for twenty three
My project bitch, 
Keep it in the  no less than brick fair
We riding with them dirty birds, no Atlanta Falcons
But she a thick bitch, so she look like a stallion

Yeah, the fifty on my wrist, and flooded out the Bezzle
It's so much work off in the kitchen, I'm dropping deuces in the blender
Got  bitch, on the work with squares in the fender
Hope she make it back, and you know that that's a winner
All my bitches loyal to me, like your boy Hugh Hefner
A minute late with my sack, you know I'm gon' suspend you
Riding round  squares, a hundred racks in diamonds
You know your boy a peanut, one false move, I might start firing
My lil' gutter bitch , I fuck with that bitch
I was running from the folk, she helped me stash the bricks
Trapping out Versace fits, I'm trapping out that Louis shit
Mexico Rann posted up with like a forty in the 'partments

Every bitch I fuck is down to take a charge
I keep a thick bitch with me, like Nicki Minaj
I gave her four, she whipped to a nine of hard
I'm in the Cutlass, but my Phantom in the garage
I keep the runts with me, and all they do is rob
I pop seals, and I can give your bitch a job
I'm from the westside, I got migos off in cars
Two million cash up in my condo, keep me 
I blow a hundred thousand, just to break the 
My plug Russian, I'm the only nigga in the mob
Put a hit on you, you gone by tomorrow
All my bitches shooters, and they'll take the charge
