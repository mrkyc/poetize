We the ones take all the risks government is the one who ship the bricks in
Man we the ones who distributes it member we fellas can't find a job
So how the f**k we gonna eat when we can't even find a job
Mama and daddy they doing they thing working barely even payin the bills
The streets is a jungle where I live MTV wouldn't cum in my crib
Telling u game when I spit this shit i eat sleep and shit the streets
So what the f**k u gone tell me
Rap or jus be all I can be hustle grind get whats mine how to make weed stuff a dime
F**k whoever tryna knock my shine remember bitch ima get whats mines
Serve whatever get through the day in the same dirty clothes for days
Ain't even ate in a day or so and really I ain't even stunting no soap
Bills is do I need some food jus like chess ima bust a move
Flip sumthin supply the food n dats jus something dat a hustla do

I'm working 24 hour shifts f**k 12 I gota get this here

This is for the streets 2x
This is for the hoods this is for the blocks
All these crooked cops
This is for the brothers that always gota hustla day in and day out gota make it through the
Struggle
Ima make it im a g since a child I been in these streets
You might also likeHustling tryna make ends meet its plenty mo niggas jus like me
Trapped behind violent shit right from wrong they didn't learn dat shit
Pitchin moves that's all they learned cook it up but don't let it burn
Gota make this money the best way we kno how
Cause ain't nothing funny when they cut the lights out
Mamas always workin n daddy hes gone been tired of the struggle so god took him home
Understand stuff we go through barely even got clothes or shoes
Forgive me god but that's all I kno wheres the faith when I need hope
No one got us right, that's y I was up all night
Getting harassed by the cops 50 deep on the block
Slamin me down in front of the folks cause I supply wat they smoke
The street was open, so I went that's the only way how it made since
If I didn't then I would starve n maceo wouldn't b no star
Older brother kep me in line gave me advice told me grind
Get yo money nigga f**k them hatas block em out nigga get this papa
Live it up we stack this cash fed time if they bust our ass
Street nigga know how I fell maintain and keep it real
Street nigga know how I fell maintain and keep it real

This is for the streets 2x
This is for the hoods this is for the blocks
All these crooked cops
This is for the brothers that always gota hustla day in and day out gota make it through the
