Fuck nigga gon' hate
I'm a just keep counting up

Freeband Gang, Black Migo, we got all the packs
Cheep bricks, cheep bails, recipes and all that
If you ain't got your own money, bitch, you need to fall back
Street nigga snitching on the low, what we call that?
You a fuck nigga
You a fuck nigga
You a fuck nigga

You say you the man, but ain't got a band
You a fuck nigga
I done did the math

You a fuck nigga
Really, we don't fuck with ya
 respect, I sware I'll let that chopper hit ya
Money so high, can't even see you niggas
I heard you fucked up, wouldn't wanna be you niggas
You see them fuck niggas, turn up on them fuck niggas
We get money, they just watching, tryna clone a nigga
You heard I got them bands, now them niggas mad
Everytime I go re-up, I spend a hundred cash
You say you getting money, where your fucking bands?

Say you getting money, I ain't seen nothing

If a nigga with me, real bosses, and they getting money
Lotta niggas talk and look, but really, they ain't doing nothing
Pulling up in foreign whips, all my young niggas stunting
All your niggas starving, they can't wait just to take something
Freeband Gang, spend money like we growing trees
Sign for a hundred thousand, boy, it ain't shit to me
Still got trap houses, shop with us in Mexico
We ain't never running out, Migo 
Real dope boy, I can teach you how to get it
I'm the man in the city, I just spent a quarter ticket
And this shit ain't really nothing, street nigga came from nothing
But a dollar and a dream, but I turned that shit into something
