You can't be playing in these streets
Making all them bad moves without no lawyer fees
My life is dangerous, to me, I put a hundred thou away, just for my lawyer fees
You can't be playing in these streets
Making all them bad moves without no lawyer fees
My life is dangerous, to me, I put a hundred thou away, just for my lawyer fees

If you a real street nigga, have that bond money stashed
How the hell you getting money? You ain't saving up no cash
Hundred K stashed in my safe deposit box
Got another 30 K, front it on the block
Already retained my lawyer, I'm the young Richard Porter
Fed case off in these streets, boy, they gon' run you a quarter
Never sat off in the  bail
They locked me up at five AM, I'm out by twelve

Making all them bad moves without no lawyer fees
My life is dangerous, to me, I put a hundred thou away, just for my lawyer fees

Sunny!
You out here playing in these streets, I done spent a hundred thousand on lawyer fees
I'm always playing in the streets
Nigga, I can move them bails, ain't gotta touch me
I pour up  pints 
I wake up on Gucci sheets
I catch plugs, they work for me
And I don't trust these niggas round me
I keep them racks for lawyer fees
You out here playing in these streets
Nigga, you gotta be a boss to stand around me

You can't be playing in these streets
Making all them bad moves without no lawyer fees
My life is dangerous, to me, I put a hundred thou away, just for my lawyer fees
You can't be playing in these streets
Making all them bad moves without no lawyer fees
