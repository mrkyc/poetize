What am I without my shadow?
What is life without knowing that death comes?
What is a song without a melody?
Need to search myself to go back
Had no signs of hope before lost in the darkness
Not knowing what my fate makes of me
And, oh, ignoring the fellowship accompanying me
There were swamps, slums, gottas, brunks, love songs
Hidden pleasure, ignored passion, secret worship
Quiet movement and undissolved self loving
Now I know God has brought me here for something
What is the mind without the heart?
What am I without my shadow?
What is life without knowing that death comes?
What is a song without a melody?
My head says I lost my way
My heart knows that my life is destined in anyway
A long road running towards stops where I pay
Pay, pay for what I've taken and is I got what I deserving
Oh, God knows very well that my sins are always before me
Yes, He gives and He takes and He wounds and He breaks
He destroys and He builds and still I know
That His love is endless grace

Tell me won't you tell me
What your mind is without your heart?
Tell me do you feel? Do you feel happiness?
May you don't feel pain
Your heart, your heart, your heart
Your heart, your heart, your heart
Your soul, your soul, your soul
Say we must destroy it in order to rebuild, in order to rebuild
Don't you know? Don't you know? Your heart
