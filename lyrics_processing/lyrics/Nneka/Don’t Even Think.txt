You will never see me beg
For the pride that you have
For the fact that you are you
For the joy you brought to me
For the pain you made me feel
Words have meanings, but actions speak louder
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
I still will stand for you make me strong
For is this what we have made
For the sunshine and the rain
For the talents that you claim, you still are human so just relax
For the hearts that you have broken, for the blood that you have been sucking
For the riches you have been claiming
I would stop you from your greed
'Cause you got to know that you would go too far
For you shall never prosper with someone's loss
For broad, broad is the way that you are o
You're running in the wrong direction

Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it, you make me full
Don't even think about it, you make me weak
Don't even think about it, you make me
I still will stand for you make me strong
You make me strong
For the love that did deceive, for the hate that you conceived
For the fact that you did what you did, I still would stand
In solitude, I am closest to life, to love
What drives me is loneliness
My heart is hardened, senses are numb
Can't feel nothing, can't hear no one, is almost like
I'm invisible but I would stand for I'm strong
Still stand naked, not one day and don't realize
I'm not complete without the Lord
I'm learning and I'm growing in my pain
But I reach out to the most high
For he is my keeper, God is my keeper, love is my keeper
You make me full, don't even think about it
You make me weak, don't even think about it
You make me full, don't even think about it
You make me strong, don't even think about it
You make me strong, don't even think about it
You make me full, don't even think about it
You make me weak, don't even think about it
You make me
I still will stand
