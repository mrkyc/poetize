U say they came and they took all we had processed
They have to take the abuse that they have caused our present state with their intruding history
Use our goodness and nourishment in the Name of missionary
Lied to us, blinded slaved us, misplaced us, strengthen us, hardened us then
They replaced us now we got to learn from pain
Now it is up to us to gain some recognition
If we stop blaming we could get a better condition

Wake up world!!
Wake up and stop sleeping
Wake up Africa!!
Wake up and stop blaming
Open ur eyes!!
Stand up and rise
Road block oh life penalty
Why do we want to remain where we started
And how long do we want to stop ourselves from thinking
We should learn from experience that what we are here for this existence
But now we decide to use the same hatred to oppress our own brothers
It is so comfortable to say racism is the cause
But this time it is the same color chasing and biting us
Knowledge and selfishness that they gave to us, this is what we use to abuse us

Wake up and stop blaming
Open ur eyes!!
Stand up and rise
Road block oh life penalty
Those who have ears let them hear
Brothers who are not brainwashed take ruins and rest
Pick them up and stick them back together
This is the only way we can change this African weather
Lied to us, blinded slaved us, misplaced us, strengthen us, hardened us then
They replaced us now we got to learn from pain

Wake up world!!
Wake up and stop sleeping
Wake up Africa!!
Wake up and stop blaming
Open ur eyes!!
Stand up and rise
Road block oh life penalty
You got to wake up please
You got too
(Wake up Africa, wake up and stop blaming)
Blaming ha, ha, ha
Open yours eyes your eyes
Stand up and rise
Road block oh life penalty
