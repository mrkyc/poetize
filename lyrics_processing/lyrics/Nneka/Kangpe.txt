You say your husband na I leave you, you say I go fit betray you
So na so you dey weak as
I see you before I think say you dey kangpe
Nothing fit, fit shake you, nothing fit, go fit break you
But na you rake before
Na you talk say you no go put man before God
Oh, see yourself as you be
Na you talk say you no go put man before God

As you know God no go give you anything you no go fit deal with
Na so dem talk, the thing en no go fit kill you
Na I go make you strong it go make you strong
The thing wen no go fit kill na I go make you strong
The thing wen no fit kill na I go make you strong
God no go give you anything you no go fit deal with
You talk, say you be big man
Because you fit raise your hand, fit beat your pickin, beat your wife
You sabi, bible well o
Dey go church everday oh
Notice me or I quench
Look at me how I bounce
But na you be the crook
Na your kind fit open eye kill person misuse and abuse him
419, ole, thief, basket mouth, ojoro
But na you know how I be
Wen wind blow fowl ynash go open very very well oh

As you know God no go give you anything you no go fit deal with
Na so dem talk, the thing en no go fit kill you
Na I go make you strong it go make you strong
The thing wen no go fit kill na I go make you strong
The thing wen no fit kill na I go make you strong
God no go give you anything you no go fit deal with
As you walk through the valley of the shadow of death
You will fear no evil because his rod and his stalf are with you
