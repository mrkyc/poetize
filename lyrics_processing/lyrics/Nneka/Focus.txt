Money, banks, foundation and discoveries
Mischievious and self centered development strategies
Uneffective enough not to affect the physics and the spirits of mankind
In short and infact where do we go from here when we lack love in our hearts
When we lack an open heart and lie to ourselves and the one that truly loves, that we love
Truly we don't really give a fuck
Another day has passed my conscience is hunting me one small form
E to face this next temptation that is coming up now
The flesh has overcome the spirit, eyes opened but shot, sight blurred
Can't see the road because I am scarred of the lights
I gotta go on, I gotta move on, we gotta go on, we gotta move on
Cause if you don't search for the truth your soul will definitely remain undone
Chorus
Maintain your Focus
The misery is all around you
The misery, the envy
It is hard staying away from the temptations of the world
Maintain your mind, see
Is it the drugs? Is it the men? Is it the money? Is it the fame?
Do not need all this to find myself
Have met my shadow a thousand times
I know how it feels to be untrue to oneself
See would you hold back the things that urged you to speak your mind?
Living in the bondage, in if clauses for the rest of your life
You want to lie in systems custody, your soul strip for free
Living in the bondage, in if clauses for the rest of your life
You want to lie in system custody, your soul strip for free
You might also likeWill you sell your soul for free?
Maintain your Focus
The misery is all around you
The jealousy, the envy
It is hard staying away from the temptations of the world
Maintain your mind
Maintain your Focus
The poverty is all around you
The misery and envy
It is hard staying away from the temptations of the world
Bridge
Temptations of this world
You see the demons coming out of you
They reveal themselves to you and yes you can see your truth
Oh no no, got to maintain your mind
In this world of pain
In this world of sin
In this world of hate
Maintain your Focus
The misery is all around you
The misery
It is hard staying away from the temptations of the world
Maintain your mind, see
Maintain your Focus
The misery is all around you
The misery and envy
It is hard staying away from the temptations of the world
