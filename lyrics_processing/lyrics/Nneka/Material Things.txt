Private jets, limousine chauffeurs, all of that
Money, clothes and oh, diamonds, cars, rims, shining
None of this compares to what I see in you
Materials don't mean a thing to me
Girl, you are the world to me
If I had to pick a favorite thing
It would easily be my baby
Materials don't mean a thing to me
If I lost you, lady, then I'd go crazy
And I wouldn't have anything
Black cars, fly homes, condos with the chefs
Personal assistants, corporate, real estate
Yachts that will take you far away to islands
 bungalows, Costa Rica, Mexico
Girl, none of this compares to what I see in you
Materials don't mean a thing to me
Girl, you are the world to me
If I had to pick a favorite thing
It would easily be my baby
Materials don't mean a thing to me
If I lost you, lady, then I'd go crazy
And I wouldn't have anything, oh
You might also likeNothing without you, you make me wealthy
I'm all about you, so special to me
I turned off the phone, spent time alone
I don't wanna be selfish, girl, you're the one
I put you above all the superficial things
Materials don't mean a thing to me
Girl, you are the world to me
If I had to pick a favorite thing
It would easily be my baby
Materials don't mean a thing to me
If I lost you, baby, then I'd go crazy
And I wouldn't have anything
Materials don't mean a thing to me
Girl, you are the world to me
If I had to pick a favorite thing
It would easily be my baby
Materials don't mean a thing to me
If I lost my lady
And I wouldn't have anything
