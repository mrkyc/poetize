I see hatred in your face
The fierce look you wear has killed my confidence
I have made many mistakes
I carry a heart an open wound my love
But forgiveness is king my friend
And grudge is not a fruit of the spirit
Therefore I come to you as I am
Naked as I am, I found the truth

As the moon pulls the ocean
So the Earth pulls the moon
In the same way I am what I am
Cause your existence defines my being
As my weakness is my strength
So my tear they find happiness
In the same way I know that your hate reflects boundless love
(Yeah, boundless love oh)

The world doesn't stop
(doesn't stop)
When we command it to
Our righteousness is strong I learn to love you yea
Everything isn't what it seems to be
Now we wanna run we wanna go fast
As my soul was within sin
My feet could stand on solid ground
Cause I know
You might also like
The moon pulls the ocean
So the earth pulls the moon
In the same way I am what I am
Cause your existence defines my being
As my weakness is my strength
So my tears they find happiness
In the same way I know that your hate
Reflects boundless Love

I'm getting rid of the jee jinx that you gave
Getting hold of all the things I deserve
I'm letting go of all of the lies that you told
I'm getting rid of all the things that you've said
I'm getting rid of the jee jinx that you gave
I'm getting hold of all the things I deserve
I'm letting go of all the lies that you told
My confession for you to own
Ooh as the earth now earth pulls the moon
Same way I that I am
Cause your existence defines my being
As my weakness is my strength
So my tears they find happiness
In the same way I know that your hate reflects boundless love
As the moon pulls the ocean
(reflects boundless love)
In the same way I am what I am
(reflects boundless love)
As my weakness is my strength
