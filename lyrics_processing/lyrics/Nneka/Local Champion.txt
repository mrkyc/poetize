Shebi I be half caste, because I carry colour follow body, borrow pose
Shebi I be villager, because I get swag wey lagos woman no get
You talk sey I be illiterate because I get waffi attitude for inside my blood
I no go lie, I tried to adjust to your oyibo Lagos style, but I failed

I be Naija reggae, I be warri reggae
Dem born me near Okporikoko village
I be warri reggae, dem say I be waffi mugu
But dem see me for your Lagos city poster
Waffi reggae, I be Naija reggae
Dem born me near Okporikoko village
I be warri reggae, dem say I be waffi mugu
But dem see me for your Lagos city poster

Make we no lie, na you talk sey my food resemble mama put own
But you must confess, na my local way dey sweet you pass
Shebi you dey miss me now, coz I no wear skirt, koi koi shoe and weave-on
Because I no like your flashy way, you dump originality, dump, dump me

I be Naija reggae, I be warri reggae
Dem born me near Okporikoko village
I be warri reggae, dem say I be waffi mugu
But dem see me for your Lagos city poster
Waffi reggae, I be Naija reggae
Dem born me near Okporikoko village
I be warri reggae, dem say I be waffi mugu
But dem see me for your Lagos city poster
