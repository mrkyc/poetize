I must sleep, lay me down to sleep
I must sleep (oh), lay me down to sleep
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep

When my strength is overcome, all my effort come undone
The light of the day, overshadowed, dawns turns dusk
When the chains that were once broken
Become an invisible burden for us to carry forever
If the wounds that turn to scars, grow bigger go deeper
You still feel pain would not go away would not wither
When the mirror that was broken is put back together
And then begins to scream your name, your name
When you realize decisions you have made are made
You can't turn back time, you can't change your fate
You have killed, you let her suffer
You make the world suffer, you let him down, you let God down
Oh, oh you carry your own cross, and I too, I carry my cross, oh
I can see, but

I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
I must sleep (oh), bring me down to sleep
I must sleep (free my soul), bring me down to sleep (when I lay me down)
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
You might also like
Them ball, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, oh!
But the sleep so deep, it feel better in the soul and the tears
The fears, the cries, the lies, we stay stuck
Sleep my life away but I don't wanna wake up
Murderers
Blood of our children, mothers they scream, this ain't right
Murderers!
Just have to know who's the real enemy in this fight
Oh you carry your cross, and I too, I carry my cross, oh

I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep

I'm asleep
Free my soul
When I need me down
I'ma sleep
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep (lay me down to sleep, lay me down to sleep)
I must sleep, bring me down to sleep
