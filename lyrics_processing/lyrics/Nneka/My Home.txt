(dark, dark, dark)
I don't know what tomorrow will bring
For you say that, who not know how to suffer
Will never see good
Lord, I depend, oh I depend on you
Into you
Where do I go when this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to when they put me down
You are my hope, when they all backstab me
You're my beginning, my middle, my end
When there's a whole, in this heart of mine
When they put me down, oh you know
You are my home
My beginning, my middle, my end
My beginning, my middle, my end
All I am left with is to trust in thee, oh Lord
For mankind had disappointed me, oh no
See me weary, for I am lonely, lonely
Father Father, Jah, oh save me now
For I am dying
Where do I go when this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to when they put me down
You are my hope, when they all backstab me
You're my beginning, my middle, my end
When there's a hole, in this heart of mine
When they put me down, oh you know
You are my home
My beginning, my middle, my end
My beginning, my middle, my end
You might also likeWhere do I go
My beginning, my middle, my end
To live, when they forsake me and wound me
I just don't know where to go
Where do I go
My beginning, my middle, my ending
Where do I go when this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to when they put me down
You are my hope, when they all backstab me
You're my beginning, my middle, my ending
When there's a hole, in this heart of mine
When they put me down, oh you know
You are my home
My beginning, my middle, my end
