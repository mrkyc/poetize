Could you let him in?
He's standin' right next to us
But we dig space between
..., accept us and leave re...
What we plea to practise
Good things we say and to others in need
But we destroy the precious time and power we posess
We do not see
Mcs we are on stage, conquer ourselves
To ... given to you as a sign of responsibility
So before you pick up the mic and battle
Seriously - what is the mission?
It's definetly one for each one of us
Pay attention this a call
We're up to win souls, not send them lust
It is evil standing right next to us
Taking control, watching us
The devil always seeking for souls, leaning us
So take your sword
People, this is the word of God
It's about giving love, showing love, doing love, living love, making love
This is the major issue, instead we let our spirits down and the mind takes over (2x)
People tell me there's no God
People force to believe only in the things that they see
But in the things you see, well take a look properly
It's a power that holds us on to one joy
One ... - we only want to see punishment
But we don't believe in ourselves
So we can't trust the fact of believing
Live too comfortable ...
...push love for our neighbour
But I am what I am as many may see
But be truthfull to yourself and do me the favor
Stop blaming back and look at your life
For you - Jezebeles, Judases, ... prophets, man of god
Prostitutes, popes, teachers, lawyers, all you scholars, rulers, chosen few
All of you, rise and spread love!
It's about loving love, showing love, doing love, living love, be in love
This is the major issue, instead we let our spirits down and the mind takes over
It's about loving love, showing love, doing love, living love, stay in love
This is the major issue, instead we let our spirits down and the mind takes over
This is the major issue
Evil standing right next to us
Taking control, watching over us
The devil always seeking for souls, leaning us
So take your sword, the word of God
Evil standing right next to us
Taking control and is watching over us
The devil always seeking for souls, leaning us
So take your sword, the word of God
It's about loving love, showing love, doing love, living love, be in love
