You said you won't, I bet my neck, I bet you will
I'm gonna check my love, you I'm gonna thrill
You can't imagine what you've missed, can't go on
Meet me at midnight in the light that starts the love

Since there was you
I changed my mind about it all
Instead of going on
I'm gonna settle for a fall
My love, my love will lift you up
Up, up

You came into my life
And now I realize
Today we love, we might
But it is for sure at midnight
Ooh, ooh

Since there was you
I changed my mind about it all
Instead of going on
I'm gonna settle for a fall
My love, my love will lift you up
Up, up
You might also like
You came into my life
And now I realize
Today we love, we might
But it is for sure at midnight

At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight (Midnight)
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight (Midnight)
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight (Midnight)
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight (Midnight)
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight (Midnight)
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
