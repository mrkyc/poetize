It's not the way you smile that makes me realize
I think I love you
It just might be that all my life I've been searchin' for
Someone just like you

Takin' my time
Everything's fine
I call you by the phone
Nobody's home

We've got better days
There'll be better days
We've got better days, yeah

I don't know why but I wanna cry
Every time you touch me
I've givin' up, just can't help it
In your arms is where I'd rather be, yeah

I just can't hide it
So I decided to give
Stored away, I've got the strength to live, yeah, uh-huh

There'll be better days, yeah, yeah


Better days, better days
Better days, better days
Better days, better days
Better days (Yeah), better days (Yeah, yeah)
Better days, better days (Feels so good now)
Better days, better days
Better days, better days (Oh, oh)
Better days (Ooh), better days
Better days, better days
Better days, better days
Better days, better days
Better days, better days
Better days, better days
Better days, better days
