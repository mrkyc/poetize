One night I prayed to God
I asked could he please remove the enemies from my life
And before you know it I started losing friends

Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But it's okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

Yeah, y'all was like my brothers, I considered y'all as folks (Folks)
And I remember nights sipping liquor, making toasts (Toasts)
Talking about the life, tryna get it slinging dope (Yeah)
And niggas say I changed, but you niggas changed first (First)
And fuck all this money, nigga, we was fam' first (Fam')
Looking at me balling, know that Instagram hurt (Hurt)
'Cause you was supposed to be that nigga in that damn Ghost (Yeah)
I would've rolled for you even in the same hearse (Woah)
Same cemetery, bury me in the same dirt (Dirt)
We had a plan, but I guess it ain't work (Work)
"B.H we straight," that was the motto, my nigga
I got rich first, you was supposed to follow, my nigga
I'm gone

Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But it's okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around
You might also like
And that nigga Lil, shit, I can't believe you (Not you)
That's what that syrup and that weed do? (Weed do?)
And when I came home I tried to feed you (Feed you)
And every song I was screaming free you (Free that nigga Lil)
And if you bled I was down to bleed too (Bleed too)
Now when I ride by I breeze through (Breeze through)
I don't even stop, it ain't a need to (Nah)
And you the one that left, nigga, I ain't leave you (You)
Shit got realer (Realer), niggas got richer (Richer)
I said the money train coming (It's coming), niggas missed it (I did)
I even tried to spin back around to come and get you (Get you)
But niggas wanted more from me then my own sister (Damn)

Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But it's okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

They wanted more than my mother (Mother)
More than Omelly and that nigga like my brother (Brother)
Greedy motherfucker
Crazy thing about it, I don't hate 'em, I still love 'em (Love)
I might have said things, I never said fuck 'em
But I'ma live my life, get the money, ball hard (Ball hard)
Still sending earned money for his calling cards (Calling cards)
Rick ain't complaining and he got life behind bars
And he still calling me, bet you he ain't calling y'all (Nah)
'Cause none of y'all niggas ain't send him shit yet (Nah)
None of y'all niggas ain't send him pics yet (Nah)
I'm still writing money orders, sending big checks
And remember when it rain, niggas get wet
Gone
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But it's okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

I still love niggas
But it's like we just grew apart
If you don't grind, you don't shine
Half my niggas still around, and we all shining hard
