I want a woman I can do things for
Give her the world if she wants it
All things and even more
And anything her little heart desires
There's nothing I wouldn't do
And if she doesn't get quite enough
I'll break down to her knees
Until she screams please give me more

Please tell me where
Where is my love
Tell me where
Where is the girl of my dreams for me
Oh, where is my love for me.  Me, me
Me, eee, eee, eee, eee

Oh
I'm the kind of man that wants a special girl
To be the only tender in my world
She's the kind of girl that wants a special guy
To love her to the day she dies
Oh, honey
The shame about it is you don't even know I'm out there
Seems like I feel you near
Are you in this room?
Will I meet you soon?
Oh, please come to me
You might also like

Where, where  (Where? Whoo!)
Where is, oh, the girl of my dreams (Of my dreams) for me (For me)
Oh, where is my love
Oooh, baby

You know, they say love is a many splendored thing, baby
So good but so complicated
But you know, we can't seem to find each other, can we, baby?
I mean, I'm looking for you and you're looking for me too
I tell you what, I'm gonna keep on searching till I find you, 'cause I know you're out there somewhere
I won't give up on you, baby
Just please come to me now, darling
