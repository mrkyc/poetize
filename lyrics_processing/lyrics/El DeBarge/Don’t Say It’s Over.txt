You act like I'm some kind of stranger
You don't even know
Turning away, away from me now
You're trying to go
Forgive me, if I seem a little reluctant
To just let in me
When you're walking away
With all I'm living for
Well, what am I to do?
Just open the door
(B-Section 1:)
Well, there's something I just can't do
(I can't do)
And it won't be a life, baby
Living my life without you

Don't say it's over now
Don't say it's over, it's over
Don't walk away right now
Don't go, don't go, no-oh
Don't say it's over now
Don't say it's over, it's over
Don't say it's over
You might also like
Feels like I'm standing alone
On the edge of the night
Suddenly I'm realizing
I have no place in your life
Searching my heart
Just to find the right words
To touch you again
No, you just don't care
And there's nothing that I can say to you now
To turn you around
(B-Section 2:)
How can you be so damn cold
(Be so damn cold)
When I'm still holding on, baby
How can you just let go

Don't say it's over now
Don't say it's over, it's over
Don't walk away right now
Don't go, don't go, no-oh
Don't say it's over now
Don't say it's over, it's over
Don't say it's over
(ad-lib over sax solo)
(B-Section 3:)
Oh, I wish this was just a bad dream
(Just a bad dream)
Or I wish I could wake up and find
And you're still wanting me

Don't say it's over now
Don't say it's over, it's over
Don't walk away right now
Don't go, don't go, no-oh
Don't say it's over now
Don't say it's over, it's over
Don't say it's over now
(Don't say it's over now)
Oh... oh... oh... oh...
(Don't say it's over, it's over)
Oh, don't say it's over
(Don't walk away right now)
Don't go, don't go-oh-oh-ooo-oh-oh

(Don't say it's over now)
(Don't say it's over, it's over)
(Don't walk away right now)
(Don't say it's over now)
