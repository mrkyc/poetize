The one you love, one you love, one you love
It's for the one you love
Baby, it says you've dropped down from Heaven
How else can I explain the making of you?
In all of my life I never met such a girl quite like you
Knowing that you're my present and my future
It warms my heart cause I've had myself a rocky past
But right now I'm all smiles
And it's you that I owe
You made it possible!
Chorus:
So I, I'm serenading you
Straight to ecstasy!
It's where I'm taking you
Cause you were made for me!
I was made for you!
So I celebrate our love with song
With song, yeah!
And I'm lovin' how you take me for who I am
And you ain't tryin to change me into someone I'm not
It's a beautiful thing when two people get along
The way we do!
When I'm grazing my fingers, gently through your hair
The sweetest melody soft can pop out of nowhere
And it takes full control
Girl its you that I owe!
You made it possible!

From night fall until
The sun comes breaking through
Cause you were made for me!

With song, yeah, yeah!
