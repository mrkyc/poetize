So sad
Just another sad song
Oh yeah

Sick and tired of sitting in this crib and
Staring at the man in the mirror
Ever since that she left I felt a beat down in my chest, heart
So many scars, I can't remove it
It's so hard to get through it
And hittin' the club won't do it

I'm in this empty room playing my piano
Singing nothing but sad songs, sad songs
I'm so alone, no one's here but these battles
Oh, what a sad song, sad song

Shouldn't have got up on my knee yeah
Make you feel like you're the only one that I needed
Girl, I gave you my heart for the keeping
All the love I put in your heart was deleted, yeah
Baby, you took advantage, look at me damaged
It's not how we planned it, yeah
The light's flick on, no one's around
Tell me what it's all about
As the tears roll down my face, time just won't erase
What we had can't come back
Stuck in the past where the love was at
Girl, I miss yawhy did you quit on?

I'm in this empty room playing my piano
Singing nothing but sad songs, sad songs
I'm so alone, no one's here but these battles
Oh, what a sad song, sad song

And the melody that I tend to play, started to play when you left
In they key of loneliness, I can't resist hoping for your best
I just know that the door closes when you leave
Only thing here is these memories and these sad songs haunting me

I'm in this empty room playing my piano
Singing nothing but sad songs, sad songs
I'm so alone, no one's here but these battles
Oh, what a sad song, sad song

I'm sad
Sad, sad, sad, sad songs
Sad, sad, sad, sad songs
