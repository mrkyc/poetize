All alone, sad and brokenhearted
Didn't have no peace within, baby
And uh, I thought that I would feel this way forever
Oh, but darlin' you brought the Heaven back again, baby
Sun didn't shine, it just kept on raining, oh yeah
So I thought my life was over, baby

But you brought the rainbow at the end of the storm
And if I had to do it all over again
I'd start my life with you, 'cause baby

You got the love I want
(You're my Heaven)
And I know that you got the love I want
(You're my angel)
Honey, you got the love I want
(Can't stop thinkin' about you, baby)
And as long as I live my life
I want to live my life for you (Hey)

And I must confess, girl, I love you, baby
Though at times I know I don't show it, darlin'
But you got that way of always makin' me say
(Here I go) Here I go, I'm givin' in again, baby
Sometimes, I just sit down and watch you, baby
What did I ever do to deserve you, darlin'?
You might also like
But you don't ever have to worry
What another girl may say or do
'Cause I've searched and I've searched, girl, my whole life through
And none of them compare to you, 'cause baby

You got the love I want
(You're my Heaven)
And I know that you got the love I want
(You're my angel, baby)
Oh, you got the love I want
(Can't stop thinkin' about you, baby)
Honey, as long as I live my life
I want to live my life for you

And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you, baby
You occupy each moment of the day
Me for you, you for me
That's the way it's supposed to be, baby
Shout it from a mountain
'Cause I want the world to know that

You got the love I want
(Baby, yeah)
You got the love I want
(You're my angel; girl, all I want is you)
You got the love I want
(Nobody else will do, baby)
And honey, as long as I live my life
I want to live my life for you
Yeah, you touched my heart, baby
I never thought that I could find somebody like you, baby
You're so sweet, you're so kind
I swear nobody loves me like you do
And honey, as long as I live
I want to live my life for you
(You got my heart, baby)
You got the love I want
(Got my soul, don't you know?)
Oh, you got the love I want
(You must have been sent from above, baby, yeah)
You got the love I want
(Hey baby, oh girl)
And honey, as long as I live, hey, baby
You got the love I want
