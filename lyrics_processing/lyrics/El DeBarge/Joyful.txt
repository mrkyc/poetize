Getting crazy, don't faze me
Ask me "why" and I ask you "why not"
It's all a symptom of human nature
When things are falling apart, they turn into
Disappointments, or blessings
Lessons for the heart, baby
And no, I wouldn't trade you for the world
I wanna hit the end before what we start
Girl, listen to me

Stop roaming 'round, settle down, you can't erase this
You got me and I got you
So don't be afraid to lose, appreciate that

It's so joyful feeling the pain again
I get myself in trouble whenever I try to resist
I learned to embrace the struggle whether I lose or win
I'm living indeed so joyful to feel the pain and love again

Now here's a message for the young and restless
It might take you some time to really get it
Don't take your baby for granted
Sometimes you gotta give a lot to get a little bit, so
You might also like
So stop roaming 'round, settle down, you can't replace
What you can never get again
Hear the sound in your heart
You better try to win 'cause you got a lot to lose
So it's really up to you to appreciate that

It's so joyful feeling the pain again
I get myself in trouble whenever I try to resist
I learned to embrace the struggle whether I lose or win
I'm living indeed so joyful

Here I go again
I'm already knowin' what I gotta go through
So I'm opening up to you
I can feel you now, and I need you to show me how
I feel just like a flower in the rain
Waiting for the sun to shine again, but I appreciate you

It's so joyful feeling the pain again
I get myself in trouble whenever I try to resist
I learned to embrace the struggle whether I lose or win
I'm living indeed so joyful to feel the pain and love again
It's so joyful feeling the pain again
I get myself in trouble whenever I try to resist
I learned to embrace the struggle whether I lose or win
I'm living indeed so joyful to feel the pain

Oh, being in love again, oh yeah
I'm living my life again
This time I'm gonna win
Oh, this time I'm gonna win
I'm already knowin'...
Guess I better let it flow, tears in my eyes
There's no surprise, baby
Can't shake it, baby
Guess I better let it flow, baby
Just let it be, it's supposed to be
Don't try to change it
Baby, just let it be, yeah baby
Swallow my pride, set that aside
Open your eyes
Baby, just let it flow, tears in my eyes
There's no surprise, baby
Can't shake it, baby
Guess I better let it flow, baby
Just let it be, it's supposed to be
Don't try to change it
