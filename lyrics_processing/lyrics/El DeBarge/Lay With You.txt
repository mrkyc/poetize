(Oh baby) Ah baby (Oh yeah)
I just wanna lay right here with you
Baby, I just wanna lay with you

I know you have work
But I would love for you to stay with me
For a little while longer
I'm asking a lot
But I don't want you to go away
'Cause I can't get you out of my mind, girl

I could just look at you (All day long)
Your beautiful smile I just (Can't go wrong)
If only you didn't have to leave
You could relax and chill with me

Let's not leave the house today
I just wanna lay with you
With your body close to mine
Room service will be on the way
I just wanna lay with you
Can't get enough of you, girl
You might also like
Oh baby, you're making it hard for me to leave
Wish I didn't have to go
So next time around
Let's hope it rains so we can just stay in
'Cause I just wanna lay with you

I could just look at you (All day long)
Your beautiful smile, I just (Can't go wrong)
If only you didn't have to leave
We could relax and just chill in these sheets

Let's not leave the house today
I just wanna lay with you
With your body close to mine
Room service will be on the way
I just wanna lay with you (I wanna lay with you, baby)
Can't get enough of you, girl

Ooh, one night with you is like heaven (Like heaven)
I don't wanna go from here (Oh baby)
Kissing your neck while you're sleeping (Sleeping)
Lovin' you're near
Let's not leave the house today
I just wanna lay with you
(Baby, I just wanna lay) Yeah, baby (Ooh)
Room service will be on the way
I just wanna lay with you
(Can I, can I, can I lay?)
'Cause I can't get enough of you, girl
Let's not leave the house today
I just wanna lay with you, baby, oh
Baby, I just wanna lay with you
(I wanna lay with you, baby) Lay with you

Oh, I just wanna lay right here with you
(Can I lay with you, baby?)
Oh, I just wanna lay right here with you
(Lay with you) (Can't get enough of you, girl)
Oh, I just wanna lay right here with you
(Can I lay with you? Can I lay with you?)
