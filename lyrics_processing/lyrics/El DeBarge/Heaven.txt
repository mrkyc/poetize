All the ladies in the house, I see
I see things like heaven girl
Every time will be together girl, girl, girl
Last night I saw an angel
Opening the wings for me
That girl has been here all alone
My love for her was a secret
And her love was new for me
She knows every time she hears this song

And I hear the voice of angel sing with me, she's all right
That she's always there to beat me up with, all falls down
And the love I had to give before his I heard now, I heard now
Every time that I'm with you, it feels just like heaven
Anytime I look at you, girl, it feels just like heaven
If I could sunshine it through, baby, it feels just like heaven
And I know that..I've been missing you, it feels just like heaven
I've seen the light in your eyes, it feels like eternity
And I'll be in hell if she ever leaves, don't leave me girl
I'm blinded by her beauty, she shines like a ..,
And I'm not afraid to tell her, shares what she needs to me
You might also like
And I hear the voice of angel sing with me, she's all right
That she's always there to beat me up with, all falls down
And the love I had to give before his I heard now, I heard now
Every time that I'm with you, it feels just like heaven
Anytime I look at you, girl, it feels just like heaven
If I could sunshine it through, baby, it feels just like heaven
And I know that..I've been missing you, it feels just like heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven
Just like heaven baby, it feels just like heaven
Every time that I'm with you, it feels just like heaven
Anytime I look at you, girl, it feels just like heaven
If I can see the sunshine in to your eyes, baby, it feels just like heaven
And I know that..I've been missing you, it feels just like heaven
Every time that I'm with you, it feels just like heaven
Anytime I look at you, girl, it feels just like heaven
