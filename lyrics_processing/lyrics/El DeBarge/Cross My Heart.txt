Here I go again
Trap in my identity
My reputation
Always goes ahead of me
I'm not the one you love, no
I'm the one you've heard of
Before you walk away it's one more thing I need to say

I love you baby (Cross my heart)
I need you babe (Cross my heart)
Open you heart and you will be
Glad that you open to me
Cause I love you babe (Cross my heart)
I need to you babe (Cross my heart)
I cross my heart I'm about to die (Ooooh, oooh aah)

Love is a blessing baby
Love has made a change in me
I'm not the same man
I'm not the way I used to be
I know the price I had to pay
I'm ready to go all the way
No need to worry
This time you can be sure
