Tilt up... oh!

If you need, somebody there
Someone to hold you close
Someone to care
Got something here, waiting for you
And I would not believe

Giving you, giving you my private line

Oh... oh... oh...
Giving you, giving you my private line
To this heart of mine
Oh, you, you got my private line
Oh... oh... oh... oh...
Aw, baby
Mmm...
