Can't get enough, baby, get enough
Can't get enough of your love, sweet darlin'
Ah baby

Last night was incredible, baby
You showed me things that I've never, ever seen
I swear, it's unforgettable
Girl, I can't believe the freaky things you did with me, yeah

Lord knows how much you danced into my heart
You know, you didn't miss a beat with me
And I swear, I swear I didn't think you'd go so far

Hey, last night, so sensual, baby
You gave me love like I never ever dreamed
I swear it was unusual
Girl, you showed me special things no man has ever ever seen
You might also like
And God knows I never felt this good, baby
You knew just what to do, just how to please
And I swear, I swear I never thought I'd get so hot, baby

Please, please, please come over here
And let me taste your sweet love again
'Cause I never knew a girl
Who could make me feel so good
Now I know I got to have it all the time
