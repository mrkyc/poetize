You know what?
You're such a perfect lover
And baby, you could do better than me
But you stuck by me like a soldier
Sweet loving until... (That's right, baby)
Set me up on a pedestal
Still love me wrong or right
It's a mystery why I'm so lucky
I keep trying to figure it out

Tell me how can you love me so much, girl?
Put up with all of the crazy things I do
How can you love me so much, baby?
I can always count on you

I think you're trying to tame me (Yes, you are)
But I don't think your trying to change me, no
You say I'm your diamond in the raw (Diamond in the raw)
Your baby, your man (I guess I am)
I'm so unpredictable
Yet your love's unconditional for me
And I wanna know why
You might also like
Tell me how can you love me so much, girl
And put up with all of the crazy things I do?
How can you love me so much, baby?
I can always count on you

I can recall so many days
Walked through the door and brought home all my selfish ways
But you remained just as beautiful
You never ever ever change
Your love is strong
It goes on and on and on (Hey, baby)

Girl, put your weight on my shoulders
I'll carry you, that's what good lovers do
I'll pamper, stroke, and please, and hold ya
Girl, tonight, this is all about you, oh

How can you love me so much, girl?
Put up with all of the crazy things I do
How can you love me so much, baby?
I can always count on you, baby
How can you love me so much?
(Love me like you do, baby)
Put up with all of the crazy things I do
And how can you love me so much, girl?
I can always count on you, baby
I love you so much, darling
I don't know what it is you love about me so much, baby
You're special, baby
Wantin' me, baby
You're special, girl
You're special, baby (Hoo)
You're special, girl
Wantin' me, baby
You're special, girl (Oh)
You're special, baby
You're special, baby (Hoo)
Wantin' me, baby
