Five seconds, five seconds
Five seconds, baby girl you're on
Once you're on ain't no coming off
Shine so much the sun could take a summer off
Some of y'all dunno a butterfly from a moth
Turn the El DeBarge on take something off
All I know is all you need is me
Girl, that's for sure, just let me teach you
What you need to know
I only need five seconds, girl
You know that I can change your life
South of France
See the clear blue waters
Hearing the wind
I can take you places you've never been
Girl tell me baby, what's your pleasure
Tell me your fetish too
I waited, baby there's no measure
There's no limit to what we can do
All I know is all you need is me
Girl, that's for sure, just let me teach you
What you need to know
I only need five seconds, girl
You know that I can change your life

Believe me girl, there's plenty
Money to spend
Girl, we can do anything we want to
Creme brulee in an LA cafe
Late New York rendezvous
Every moonlight in Miami
We'll be on a private jet for two
All I know is all you need is me
Girl, that's for sure, just let me teach you
What you need to know
I only need five seconds, girl
You know that I can change your life
Five seconds on the shot clock
Is you tryna win the game or get your shot blocked?
Ball player swag, basketball wifey
Them other players couldn't pass the ball like me
Leave my shorty alone, I'm asking y'all nicely
Dine and shine to get your casket all icy
Oh, all I know me and the dame kick it
I put her on a flyish, no plane ticket
Truthfully, I rather she do none
But I love it when she wear them
Lil' see through ones, yeah
I'm a make a movie when the preview's done
In five, four, three, two, one
Come with me, you need to
Don't worry, I got you
Just give me five seconds

Loving you over again, baby
Whenever, however
Just give me five seconds
