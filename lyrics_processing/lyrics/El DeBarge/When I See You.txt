Just the thought of you, being with someone else
That will never do, want you for myself
Girl, what we've been through, baby, me and you
Guess we never knew who turned out to be who

'Cause when I see you, I just die, girl
I can't explain it
My heart stops without you in my life, girl
The feeling takes me away
When I see you, I come alive, girl
I never wanna be with somebody new in my life, girl
And that's the way that I feel when I see you, you, you

No more loneliness, no more emptiness
Share a love that's strong, let's hold on to this
I will cherish you, let me shelter to you
And I promise you, all your dreams will come true

'Cause when I see you, I just die, girl
I can't explain it
My heart stops without you in my life, girl
The feeling takes me away
When I see you, I come alive, girl
I never wanna be with somebody new in my life, girl
And that's the way that I feel when I see you
You might also like
I never felt this much about anything
Girl, you know you got me good, you got me going insane
I see traces of your faces in the strangest of places
It doesn't matter what I do

I see you, and I just die, girl
I can't explain it
My heart stops without you in my life, girl
The feeling takes me away
When I see you, I come alive, girl
I never wanna be with somebody new in my life, girl
And that's the way that I feel when I see you

It's funny how all this time and all that we've been through
Gets better, and better, I love you forever
Baby, you never know who turns out to be true
From spring to September, I'll always remember
It's funny how all this time and all that we've been through
Yeah, it gets better and better, I love you forever
Baby, I never thought it'd turn out to be you
After all that we've been through, I'm still in love with you
When I see you, I just die, girl
'Cause when I see you, I just die, girl
When I see you, I just die, girl
