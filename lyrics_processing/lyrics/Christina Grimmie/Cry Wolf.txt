They say the brightest stars
Are the ones that burn out first
And I was quick to give my heart
Turns out that you kept yours

And you tell me that you love me
Tell me that you mean it
Didn't see it coming, sorry I believed it
I was buying every lie you sold
And even though we lost it
Never really had it
I was your secret hiding in the attic
The only one you never told

I need a witness
Someone to write it down
All this truth I found, it was a bitter try
Begging for forgiveness
It's a hopeless cause
You've played your cards
Don't wanna watch you cry
Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf
You might also like
You know how the story goes
In the end the wolf gets fed
You need a miracle after everything you've said

And you tell me that you love me
Tell me that you mean it
Didn't see it coming, sorry I believed it
I was buying every lie you sold
And even though we lost it
Never really had it
I was your secret hiding in the attic
The only one you never told

I need a witness
Someone to write it down
All this truth I found, it was a bitter try
Begging for forgiveness
It's a hopeless cause
You've played your cards
Don't wanna watch you cry
Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf

Save your breath, I ain't listening
There's nothing left worth you saying
So save your breath, I ain't listening at all, all
I need a witness
Someone to write it down
This truth I found was a bitter try
Begging for forgiveness
It's a hopeless cause
You've played your cards
Don't wanna, don't wanna watch you cry

Witness, someone to write it down
All this truth I found, it was a bitter try
Begging for forgiveness
It's a hopeless cause
You've played your cards
Don't wanna watch you cry

Need a witness
Someone to write it down
All this truth I found, it was a bitter try
Begging for forgiveness
It's a hopeless cause
You've played your cards
Watch you cry wolf
Wolf, wolf, wolf, wolf
They say the brightest stars
