Don't look down
'Cause it's easier falling from force
Just let it get take natures course
And pickin' it up when it's over
Don't be afraid
'Cause the chances are there for the take
But treasure the choices you make
And know when you must take it slower

You may think you've had it rough
And try to give it up
But when you think you're stuck
Just go another way

Don't let go of good times
And let the bad ones know you feel fine
And wear your heart out on your sleeve
Love is all, love is all you need

Don't be rushed
'Cause hurrying causes mistakes
Make sure to give more then take
'Cause sharing yourself brings you closer
You might also like
You may think you had it rough
And try to give it up
But when you think you're stuck
Just go another way

Don't let go of good times
And let the bad ones know you feel fine
And wear your heart out on your sleeve
Love is all you need
Feel with all your senses
Make sure to let down your defenses
It's just one way to make you see
Love is all, love is all you need

Oh-oh-oh, oh
Take a chance now, 'cause it's easy
Take a chance now for you and me
Take a chance now, you can reach it
Take a chance with me

Don't let go of good times
And let the bad ones know you feel fine
And wear your heart out on your sleeve
Love is all you need
Feel with all your senses
Make sure to let down your defenses
It's just one way to make you see
Love is all, love is all you need
Oh, it's all you need
Love is all, love is all
