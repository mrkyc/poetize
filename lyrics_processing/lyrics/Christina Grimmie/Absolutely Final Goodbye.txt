You walked into the room like king of the world (Mmm)
Like you could have your pick of all of the girls (True)
There's rumors you've been looking all over town (True)
Trying to hook someone for jamming around

I got news for you
This time it is over (Ooh, ooh)
Boy, I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve
Than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh

This is my absolutely final
I am really leaving, goodbye
Every time I take you back
You do me over, goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab
And don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final
I am really leaving, goodbye

I spelled it out, do you get it now?
I spelled it out, do you get it now?
I spelled it out, do you get it now?
Haha, oh, I'm telling you
At first you showered me with all your attention (Yeah)
Trying to do some things I can't even mention (True)
You wanna have your way and still kiss the girl (So true)
But you are living in a dream world
You might also like
I got news for you
This time it is over (Ooh, ooh)
Boy, I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve
Than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh

This is my absolutely final
I am really leaving, goodbye
Every time I take you back
You do me over, goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab
And don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final
I am really leaving, goodbye

These games that you're playing
Are played and I'm saying
No use in wasting that clever little mouth
You can't kid a kidder
The sweet taste is bitter
Boy, I found you out
I got news for you
This time it is over (Ooh, ooh)
Boy, I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve
Than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh

This is my absolutely final
I am really leaving, goodbye
Every time I take you back
You do me over, goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab
And don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final
I am really leaving, goodbye
