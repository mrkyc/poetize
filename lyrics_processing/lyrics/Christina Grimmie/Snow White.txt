Some day my prince will come for me
Save me from this harm that haunts me
When will I be free, tell me
Some day he will come for me

God, I feel like I'm locked tight
Tied up like a beast with a bad bite
Yeah, I knew you were wrong but you felt right
Good thing I didn't lay it down tonight
'Cause I wanted to apologize, but boy you fed me lies
Now I'm thinking that I rolled the dice
Now it's too late to gain your trust
Control your lust, no, baby, that's dangerous

What does it take to find me the man
Who won't go and break my heart
There's only one and he's got the key
But we are two worlds apart

Some day my prince will come for me
Save me from this harm that haunts me
When will I be free, tell me
Some day he will come for me
You might also like
Should've told you to run along
Should've backed down when I saw you coming on strong
But time is gone, attempt to rewind your past
You'll find that can't be done
But I fell for those eyes, they took me by surprise
Should've never ever compromised
But it's too late, you broke in, no warning
And now all that I got is my heartbeat

What does it take to find me the man
Who won't go and break my heart
There's only one and he's got the key
But we are two worlds apart

Some day my prince will come for me
Save me from this harm that haunts me
When will I be free, tell me
Some day he will come for me

What does it take to find me the man
Who won't go and break my heart
There's only one and he's got the key
But we are two worlds apart
Some day my prince will come for me
Save me from this harm that haunts me
When will I be free, tell me
Some day he will come for me
