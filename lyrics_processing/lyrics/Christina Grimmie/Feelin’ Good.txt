Before last night I was down on my luck
There was nothing going my way
Before last night wasn't feelin' the love
No reason for a smile on my face
But I was always told you could turn it around
Do it for the light of day
So get yourself together, head out on the town
The music gets you feeling okay
Now I'm on a roll and I'm losing control, 'cause

I got that sunshine
It's like the world is mine
I can't deny I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
Can't stop from smiling, I'm bottled lightning
Oh, deep inside I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
All my heartbreak, my long and rainy days
Are gone and now I can't complain
Everything's alright, I'm feeling so alive
I can't deny I'm feelin' good, yeah

I was so low on a Friday alone
No one even calling my phone
I looked in the mirror and I said to myself
Why am I still sitting at home?
Now I'm on a roll and I'm losing control, 'cause

I got that sunshine
It's like the world is mine
I can't deny I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
Can't stop from smiling, I'm bottled lightning
Oh, deep inside I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
All my heartbreak, my long and rainy days
Are gone and now I can't complain
Everything's alright, I'm feeling so alive
I can't deny I'm feelin' good, yeah

I got that sunshine, world is mine, I'm feelin' good
I feel it deep inside, can't deny I'm feelin' good
Everything's alright, so alive
I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' good
Hey, yeah

I got that sunshine
It's like the world is mine
I can't deny I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
Can't stop from smiling, I'm bottled lightning
Oh, deep inside I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
