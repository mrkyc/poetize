I was sittin' at the mall
With my friends on a Monday
Sayin' I was gonna leave this town
Leave this town, run away
But then you walked in
And I think my heart done skipped a beat
One look and everything just froze

Like a rock rolling down a hill
Like a car with no one at the wheel
Take me to a doctor, 'cause I'm shaking, I need water
Tell me do they have a pill, I'm feeling ill

It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It's in my heart, it's in my body
It must be love

I'm working all day and night
Stayin' busy, minding my business
Ain't looking for trouble
Got no man upon my wish-list
But now you're in my head
Get out of there, get here instead
One smile and everything just froze
You might also like
Like a rock rolling down a hill
Like a car with no one at the wheel
Take me to a doctor, 'cause I'm shaking, I need water
Tell me do they have a pill, I'm feeling ill

It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It must be love, it must be love, it must be love
It's in my heart, it's in my body
It must be love

Starts up in my chest
Kicks out of my bones
Not ready for this, was fine on my own
Flashes in my head and there must be somethin' wrong
I don't know what you did
But I can't leave you alone
It must be love, it must be love

It must be love (It must be love)
It must be love (It must be love)
It must be love (Uh, uh)
It must be love (It must be love)
It must be love (It must be)
It must be love
Oh, it's in my heart, it's in my body
