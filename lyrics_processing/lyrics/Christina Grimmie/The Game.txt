Mmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Mmm)

I called and I wait
And a wait went around
And cried with the sound of my heart
Beating for someone that just doesn't pay attention anyway
And I smile when it hurts to take a breath that day
When you held me and touched my face
Said you wanted to sleep by my side, so I pray
You're just a busy bee
And can't get to the phone right now
'Cause you're playing your game

And I hate the sound that it makes
When your heart is sick and tired
Of palpitating to a stupid play
And just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way

I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way
Just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time

This game, he was a pro
He knew all the rules
Had me wrapped tightly around his dirty finger
What I don't understand is I'll fall for a man
Who really ain't a man at all
If you know what I'm talkin' about then

I'm not even gonna complain
'Cause I'm sick and tired
Of palpitating to a stupid play
And just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way

I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never ever gonna change
Just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way, oh

I throw my hands up in the air because I care
I throw my hands up in the air, 'cause it's not fair, uh
You don't care, it's not fair, yeah
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never ever gonna change
Just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never ever gonna change
Just because of you
I laugh and cry at the same time
It's never any other way

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
