Girl, he did you wrong
Now you're all alone, all alone
Tellin' all our friends that you never saw it comin' on
Everyone could see what a creep, what a creep he was
How could you believe all his cheap talk?

Eye for an eye for every lie he ever told ya

Go make it right for every time he never called ya

And you deserve 'em all, yeah
Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now
Get yourself, get yourself together now
Go get yourself, get yourself together now
