Bet you didn't think I could walk through fire
Come out stronger on the other side
I made a scene and you can't deny
Inside your head I will never win
You let them tell them you who you are
But I'm me, I'm heading far

I'm not breakable, I'm unshakable
Why you trying to hold me down? (Why you try, try to hold me down)
I'm not breakable, so unstoppable
Nobody's gonna knock me out

No bending me
I'll never be like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see fragments of me
Like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that

I packed my bags and I'm out the door
Don't let it hit you on the way out
I'm moving on, don't have a doubt
You might also like
I'm not breakable, I'm unshakable
Why you trying to hold me down? (Why you try, try to hold me down?)
I'm not breakable, so unstoppable
Nobody's gonna knock me out

No bending me
I'll never be like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see fragments of me
Like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that
No bending me
I'll never be like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see fragments of me
Like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that

Mirrors can crack
And hearts can collapse, oh
I'm not fragile like that
Lights will burn out and walls can fall down, oh
I'm not fragile like that
No bending me
I'll never be like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see fragments of me
Like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that
No bending me
I'll never be like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see fragments of me
Like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that

No bending me
I'll never be like broken glass
'Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see fragments of me
Like broken glass
