On the first day of class you walked into the room
Just a hot little thing with a bad attitude
And I knew, I knew, I knew you were trouble, baby (Ooh)
I was saved by the bell, couldn't wait to get home
And tell my mama 'bout this boy I don't know
Yeah, I knew, I knew, I knew it was complicated

Boy, I know you're dangerous
You're not the one I'm supposed to love
But this is more than just a crush tonight
So I'm gonna tell my mama about ya
I'ma tell her, I'ma tell her
I'ma tell my mama about ya
I'ma tell her, I'ma tell her
I'ma tell my mama about ya
I'ma tell her, I'ma tell her
I'ma tell my mama about ya
I'ma tell her, I'ma tell her
Hey, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah

Locked myself in my room
Called you up on the phone
Don't know why I hung up soon as you said, "Hello"
When it's true, it's true, you got me trippin', baby (Ooh)
That night I couldn't sleep, rolled around in the bed
'Cause the boy of my dreams is a nightmare instead
And it's true, it's true
Don't nobody tried to save me, yeah

I'ma tell her, I'ma tell her, ooh

I ain't never ever met a boy
That made me feel the way that you do, you do, you do (Ayy)
I said, I never ever met a boy that made me feel the way
That you do, you do, you do
Come on now

Boy, I know you're dangerous
You're not the one I'm supposed to love
