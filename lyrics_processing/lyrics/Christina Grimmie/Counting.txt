I can't fall asleep tonight
I'm not the same without you
Since I've been gone, since I've been gone
When I lay down at night
Nobody's here to catch the tears I cry
Can't wait to be home, wait to be home

A million more miles 'till I get to see you
A thousand more minutes I know I'll have to go through
Counting my (Counting my)
Way back to you, back to you
A hundred more thoughts of us to consume me
Too many steps 'till you're right in front of me
Counting my (Counting my)
Way back to you, back to you

I keep good company
But most days I'm still lonely
Without you here, without you here
I try to do my thing, but I just might go insane
Without you near without you near

A million more miles 'till I get to see you
A thousand more minutes I know I'll have to go through
Counting my (Counting my)
Way back to you, back to you
A hundred more thoughts of us to consume me
Too many steps 'till you're right in front of me
Counting my (Counting my)
Way back to you, back to you
You might also like
If you could travel the world
With me I'd feel so complete
We'd have the time of our lives
Right now, I keep waiting a little longer
To be by your side
Oh, yeah, babe, ooh

A million more miles 'till I get to see you
A thousand more minutes I know I'll have to go through
Counting my (Counting my)
Way back to you, back to you
A hundred more thoughts of us to consume me
Too many steps 'till you're right in front of me
Counting my (Counting my)
Way back to you, back to you (To you)

A million more miles 'till I get to see you
A thousand more minutes I know I'll have to go through
Counting my (Counting my)
Way back to you, back to you
A hundred more thoughts of us to consume me
Too many steps 'till you're right in front of me
Counting my (Counting my)
