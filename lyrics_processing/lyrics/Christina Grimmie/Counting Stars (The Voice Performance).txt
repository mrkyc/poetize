Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
We'll be counting stars
Hey Yeah, Yeah, Oh

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my faces flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
We're just doing what we're told

I, I, I ,I, I-I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing, yeah
I, I, I ,I, I-I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing, yeah
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
You might also like
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
And baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Yeah, Oh

I feel the love, and I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
We're just doing what we're told

I, I, I ,I, I-I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing, yeah
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
'Cause everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
And baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Oh, take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned

I've been, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
