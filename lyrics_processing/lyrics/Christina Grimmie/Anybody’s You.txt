Yeah

Clearing off a table, in my mind was set for two
Acting like it's nothing, but i'm feeling like a fool
And something's gotta break before another one brings me down
They bring me down (Yeah)
Next one had me trusting every word I thought was true
How could you keep lying as she's lying next to you
And something's gotta break before another one brings me down
They bring me down

But what if there's something that I keep missing?
What if there's someone that I can't lose?
Nights when I'm crying, will he listen?
Isn't there anybody? (Anybody?)
What if there's someone that makes me happy?
Someone that I already knew
What if, what if, what if that anybody, anybody's you?
Any, anybody's you, yeah

Chasing after trouble with the one I wouldn't keep
One of many wasting time falling at his feet
Feels good going up then it crashes hard when he brings me down
They bring me down (Yeah)
I'm getting tired, tired
Of looking everywhere for somebody like you
I'm just tired, tired, and it brings me down
They bring me down

Someone to listen
Someone to make me happy
Someone who loves me
