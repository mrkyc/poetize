Ooh, ooh
Ahh

Coming home, the locks broken
And the door's wide open
It's all gone, it's all gone now
I look around, it's just white walls
Listen now to echoes
It's all gone, it's all gone now

Ever since you broke into me
Ever since you left with the key
I can't open up for anyone
Anymore, anymore, oh

You took the sun, the moon, and the stars
Now I'm walking all alone in the dark
You stole my heart, you stole my heart
Give it back to me (Back to me)
All the love that we made here is gone
I'm living in an empty house of cards
You stole my heart, you stole my heart
Give it back to me
King of thieves, the king of thieves
You're the king of thieves
The king of, the king of
You might also like
Inside, I'm hollow
'Cause you carved my heart out
It's all gone, its all gone now, oh
'Cause you dealt a cold hand
I'm stripped into nothing
Take it all, take it all, yeah, oh

'Cause ever since you broke into me
Ever since you left with the key
I can't open up for anyone
Anymore, anymore, oh

You took the sun, the moon, and the stars
Now I'm walking all alone in the dark
You stole my heart, you stole my heart
Give it back to me (Back to me)
All the love that we made here is gone
I'm living in an empty house of cards
You stole my heart, you stole my heart
Give it back to me
King of thieves, the king of thieves
You're the king of thieves
The king of, the king of
I'll play the victim
'Cause you planned it out
Like cops and robbers
Just surrender now

You took the sun, the moon, and the stars
Now I'm walking all alone in the dark
You stole my heart, you stole my heart
Give it back to me
All the love that we made here is gone
I'm living in an empty house of cards
You stole my heart, you stole my heart
Give it back to me
King of thieves, the king of thieves
You're the king of thieves
The king of, the king of

Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh
