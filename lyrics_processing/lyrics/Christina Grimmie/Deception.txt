You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, oh
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, oh
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, yeah

You unfolded your arms
And you unclenched your fists
And I dropped all my bags
And then on that star I wished
What I would do
What I would do to be loved by by you
And I opened the door
And I watched as you looked at me
With honest confusion
And certainly unrelieved
What I would do
What I would do to be loved by by you

You didn't ever, oh (you didn't ever care for me, oh)
You didn't ever, oh (you didn't ever care for me, oh)
You didn't ever care
So now I'm sitting here wondering why
You might also like
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, oh
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, oh
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, yeah

I can't take back the bite
This fruit was not meant for me
Deception and vice
At the finest I'd ever seen
But what I would do
What I would do to be loved by by you
And the funny thing is
That I settled for the untruth
Just because
I'm a slave to the fantasy of being in love
And what I would do to be loved by by you

Thinking it through
Now I see everything
How did I not know it
Life with you's but a dream
But what I would do
What I would do to be loved by by you
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, oh
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, oh
Ohh
Now I'm sitting here wondering why
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, oh
You didn't ever care for me
You didn't ever care for me, oh
You didn't ever care for me, care for me, oh
