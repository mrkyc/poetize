Hope you guys like it
Woah, woah, woah

Here is my new song and it didn't take long
It's not a cover, I hope you won't bother
It's not karaoke, I'm keeping it low-key
I'm no psychic but I hope that you like it

Here it goes, now don't make me nervous
All I've got is a few random verses
I hope it gets you under the surface
I'm tryin' my best 'cause you really deserve it

Ooh, I wanna live for the moments
That are gone before we're thinkin' about them
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah
Ooh, I wanna live for the feelings
That give living this life a meaning
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah
You might also like
Maybe it's tacky
This song makes me happy
Will you sing it with me
Possibly maybe
If you think it's cheesy
You're singin' off-key
It won't matter to me, 'cause I'm feeling sunny

So here it goes, now don't make me nervous
All I've got is a few random verses
I know it'll get you under the surface
You can't go wrong cause nobody's perfect

Ooh, I wanna live for the moments
That are gone before we're thinkin' about them
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah
Ooh, I wanna live for the feelings
That give living this life a meaning
I'm singin' this 'cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah

So here it goes, now don't you get nervous
All we've got is a few random verses
I know it'll get you under the surface
You can't go wrong 'cause nobody's perfect
Ooh, I wanna live for the moments
That are gone before we're thinkin' about them
I'm singin' this cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah
Ooh, I wanna live for the feelings
That give living this life a meaning
I'm singin' this cause we'd be nothin' without them
And this is my anthem, yeah

Ooh, I wanna live for the moments
