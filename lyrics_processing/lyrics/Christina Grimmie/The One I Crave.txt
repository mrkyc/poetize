Hmm-hmm
I saw him at the corner store
He gave me candy, I came back for more
I asked for his name, he said call me J for James
He was 6'2 lots of style
He had the recipe to make you smile
But he got, too popular with the girls
So I erased him from my world
The next boy was cute and shy but he never really looked me in the eye
Secretive, I was intrigued
He was sweet, his name was Pete (sweet Pete)
First time that he took me out
I didn't know what to talk about
So I took the initiative and told Pete he had to leave
So I'm back to square one with Mr. Good For Nothing John
Ever since he brought me down, I can't get off the ground
It's not like I don't try and I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave is the one that got away
With each boy, he gets worse
I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say, I want the one that got away

He's the star of the football team
Can be found in every girl's dream
We've been talking for a while
You could say that he's on trial
But, whenever we're alone
His jaw's like a gramophone, 'cause
When he goes off the field
With him goes his appeal
So I'm back to square one with Mr. Good For Nothing John
Ever since he brought me down, I can't get off the ground
It's not like I don't try and I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave is the one that got away
With each boy, he gets worse
I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say, I want the one that got away
Here she goes again, with another boy on her hands
Word goes around, real fast in this small town
All these rumors like I'm a star
Just wanna find someone to give my heart
No luck with James, Pete or the football stud
None of them can compare
None of them can compare
To my John
It's not like I don't try and I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave is the one that got away
With each boy, he gets worse
I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say, I want the one that got away
