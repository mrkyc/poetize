Right from the start he lured me in
Took me to places I've never been
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
He might have bent me, but I didn't break
He rearranged the map I made
But I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love

Now am I crazy, why can no one understand?
That I'll never find a better man (Oh no)
I'm just imagining a life without my baby
And I know, I know
This life ain't meant to be lived without him, without him
I know, I know
This life ain't meant to be lived without him, without him
This life ain't meant to be lived without him
Without him, I know

They say this is America
Free speech, free will, but I don't even care at all
I can't seem to fight this, needing him every day and night
Why can't I just try to speak my mind to him?
Tell him all the things that he probably thought was coming
But didn't want him thinking that I'm trying to rush it
Please, dear God, give me the words
'Cause you know my tongue ties as soon as I see him blushing
I get my thoughts, put it all on a page
I might get to find a way out of the maze
That I built for myself in some kind of haze
And if the right words come to me one by one
I hope he tells me that he loves me the same
I hope he don't laugh or worse, walk away
But the honest to God, truth of the matter is
I just can't live my life without you

This life ain't meant to be lived (Yeah) without him
Without him, I know

I'm not one to really talk at all
Speak up only when the time is right or when it calls
For the big guns, problem is where to speak from
I hear it's your heart that does all the talking
Hurry up you got no time to waste
'Cause this the man I'm loving for always
And the honest to God, truth of the matter is
I just can't see my life going on without you
Now am I crazy, why can no one understand?
That I'll never find a better man (Oh no)
Oh, no, no, no, no
I'm just imagining a life without my baby
And I know, I know
This life ain't meant to be lived without him (Yeah)
Without him (Yeah)
This life ain't meant to be lived without him
