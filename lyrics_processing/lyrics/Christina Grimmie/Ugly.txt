Sometimes you look at you
And the face you see
Not who you want to be
Everybody's got it together
Or at least that's what it seems

You try to be like, why you try to be like?
Whatever they like, I know what it feels like
It can keep you up all night
Don't let them tell you how to live your life

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit
To imagine everybody in a birthday suit
Yeah, if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit
To imagine everybody in a birthday suit
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Funny how it looks when you switch the roles
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Never know what's underneath until it gets exposed
And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit
To imagine everybody in a birthday suit

She may look better than you, but come on
She's vain, she doesn't have the brains
His pants hang lower than yours
But he stumbles when he tries to run, no

You try to be like, why you try to be like? (Be like)
Whatever they like (No), I know what it feels like
It can keep you up all night
Don't let them tell you how to live your life (Ooh)

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit (Oh)
To imagine everybody in a birthday suit (Yeah)
Yeah, if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit
To imagine everybody in a birthday suit
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Funny how it looks when you switch the roles
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Never know what's underneath until it gets exposed
And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit
To imagine everybody in a birthday suit
Who cares what everybody's thinking? (No, no)
Who cares, sometimes it's cool to be uncool
Who cares if that ship is sinking?
It really doesn't matter
'Cause only you know what's good for you

And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit
To imagine everybody in a birthday suit (Oh-yeah)
Yeah, if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit
To imagine everybody in a birthday suit
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Funny how it looks when you switch the roles
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Never know what's underneath until it gets exposed
And if they make you feel ugly
Just imagine everybody in a birthday suit
