Unforgivable

Okay, let's keep this simple
I do intend to leave my life on the safe side
It's who I am and it's who you aren't
I can, I can see you clearer
When you're not lying underneath it all
And I can't see your complexion, oh-oh
And I know your heart the way you choose
You always want the best for you
Now I'm standing here with crying eyes
I still see through your disguise

I never meant for you to choose
You should've known better
There's nothing left for you to lose
When you looked at me, you said you had it all
But what you did is not unforgivable, unforgivable
But what you did is not unforgivable, unforgivable

I know things have been going on
You know you can't erase your sin
And now you can't see your reflection
I know that your heart is breaking
But is it as torn as mine, as mine?
And you've already made it known
How much you lie in what you've shown
Everything inside my head
Won't leave me alone, oh-woah
You might also like
I never meant for you to choose
You should've known better
There's nothing left for you to lose
When you looked at me, you said you had it all
But what you did is not unforgivable, unforgivable
But what you did is not unforgivable, unforgivable

And even though it's been so long
And now I know this is where I don't want to be
And I know something's not right
And now I'm telling you get off of me

I never meant for you to choose (Meant for you to choose)
You should've known better (You should've known better)
There's nothing left for you to lose
When you looked at me, you said (Yeah) you had it all (What you did)
But what you did is not unforgivable (Unforgivable)
Unforgivable (Unforgivable)
What you did (What you did) is not unforgivable, unforgivable
