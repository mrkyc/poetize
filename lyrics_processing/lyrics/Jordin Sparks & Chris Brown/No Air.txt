Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you're gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
You might also like
No air, air (Oh-oh)
No air, air (No)
No air, air (Oh-oh)
No air, air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real
But somehow, I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care

So how (How) do you expect me (Me)
To live alone with just me? (Oh, oh)
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep (So deep)
Tell me how you're gon' be without me (Without me, yeah)
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air, air (Oh, ooh-ooh)
No air, air (Oh, ooh-ooh)
No air, air (No, no)
No air, air

No more
(No, no, no, no air)
(No, no, no air) Ooh-ooh, baby
(No, no, no air) Oh-woah
There's no air, no air
Hey (No air), ooh
No air (No, no, no air), oh
(No, no, ain't there) Oh-oh

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (No air)
Can't live, can't breathe (Oh-woah) with no air (No air)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there (No breathing)
There's no air, no air (No breathing, oh)
Got me out here in the water so deep (So deep)
Tell me how you're gon' be without me (Without me, yeah)
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe (Can't breathe without you, baby)
There's no air, no air

How do you expect me? (Baby, baby)
(No air, air)
To live alone with just me

Can't live, can't breathe with no air (Hard for me to breathe, no, no, no)
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there (Oh, not there)
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you're gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air, air (Oh-oh)
