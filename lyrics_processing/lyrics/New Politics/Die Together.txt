All my tragedies
Death is only a face that won't confess
Peacefully you rest
In my bed, infest my head
Undress this plague of wicked faces
Wicked faces

You're gonna burn like the sun
When my flames come raining down
I will avenge the storm
And glaze upon your eyes

All the things I've said and done
Lost forever
Watch it all come crashing down
We'll die together
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down, we'll die together
All the things I've said and done
Now you're gonna burn

Endure the rocks the boiling seas
While I bring hell, remain deceived
By battered wings and broken limbs
Motivate the killer with the poisonous liver
You might also likeAnd return grace my only forgiver
That freed the sinner to restore faith
And watch us break connect the dots
Before you wake, before you wake
These wicked faces
Wicked faces

You're gonna burn like the sun
When my flames come raining down
I will avenge the storm
And glaze upon your eyes

All the things I've said and done
Lost forever
Watch it all come crashing down
We'll die together
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down, we'll die together
All the things I've said and done
Now you're gonna burn
You're gonna burn

Love is a forgotten face
I can't erase this silent sound
And love cannot replace
Your wicked face that's burning down
You're gonna burn like the sun
When my flames come raining down
I will avenge you by the storm
And watch the glaze upon your eyes

All the things I've said and done
Lost forever
Watch it all come crashing down
We'll die together
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down, we'll die together
All the things I've said and done
Now you're gonna burn
You're gonna burn
You're gonna burn
