Then I met a pretty angel, but she was like too dead inside
Then I met a bunch of children, with no food to eat and no place to hide
So I tried to get away now, but there's nothing in the world that can keep me in the skies
So if you ever happen to bump into to god
Please ask him if he made us all up for fun
Come on
Don't keep me waiting you've got nothing to lose
The world is fading you've got nothing to prove

Finally, we get what we deserve
I met a preacher, he had heart but he was blind
Then I met another homeless, who sold his soul for less than a dime

Please ask him if he made us all up for fun
Come on
Don't keep me waiting you've got nothing to lose
The world is fading you've got nothing to prove
Finally it all comes crashing down to the earth
Finally we get what we deserve

One wrong move and you'll taste the ground
Taste the ground
Oh oh
We are the new generation
Oh oh
We have to rebuild the nation
