She got me hooked like a psyched up junkie
A perfect dose, if you know what I mean
I ran a line like a toxic monkey
An appetite for her sweet medicine
You keep your eyes shut and you play with my mind
You let my thoughts rot and you keep them frozen in time
You seduce your victims, devour your prey
When you shoot them up, they can't escape

Just look around
There's not a sound
But when it hits you
You know that you and I are lost
Beyond the rescue
So let it through
Cause nothing matters anymore
You know I would have died for you
Do you know, do you know
That I would have died
Did you know that I would have died for you

She makes my heartbeat rattle and roll
A fatal touch that stings to the bone
Just like a snake she'll poison my soul
I don't know, I don't know, I-I-I-I don't know what to do
You're just fueling my addiction
Fooling my predictions
Flipping my condition
You seduce your victims, devour your pray
When you shoot them up, they can't escape
You might also like
Just look around
There's not a sound
But when it hits you
You know that you and I are lost
Beyond the rescue
So let it through
Cause nothing matters anymore
You know I would have died for you

My pockets are broke
I got no platinum and gold
The police got the power so I've run out of hope
My profit is so sweet I'm paying for stones
If you don't understand
I hope you die on your own

Just look around
There's not a sound
But when it hits you
You know that you and I are lost
Beyond the rescue
So let it through
Cause nothing matters anymore
You know I would have died for you
Cause nothing matters anymore
You know I would have died for you
Do you know, do you know
That I would have died
