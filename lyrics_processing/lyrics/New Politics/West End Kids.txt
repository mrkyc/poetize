Sarah says that it's not much further
Kiss the sunlight on her face
Let's say goodbye to this old and broken
Town where we fell in love
Dead end streets became a drug
Held our voices like a prison cell
But now we shout it from the rooftops
Oh, we are the kids that you never loved
We are the ones that will never grow up
We're just some kids from the west end
Woah, woah, woah
We are the voices you never heard
We are the fire you never let burn
We're just some kids from the west end
Woah, woah, woah
Say goodbye to your old friends
Kicking down all the rusty fences
Don't need much where we're going
Just a little bit of love to get us by
Goodbye, we're on our way
You and I, we got it made
Throw your gold into a wishing well
And we'll be shouting from the rooftops

Woah, woah, woah
We are the voices you never heard
We are the fire you never let burn
We're just some kids from the west end
Woah, woah, woah
We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
And we'll be shouting from the rooftops
Oh, we are the kids that you never loved
We are the ones that will never grow up

Woah, woah, woah
We are the voices you never heard
We are the fire you never let burn
We're just some kids from the west end
Woah, woah, woah
We are the kids, we are the kids, oh
