I'm feeling hopeless
I see the world beneath us open to the darkness
I see it everywhere
There's no progress
It's like I'm slowly giving in to all the madness
I stand here imperfect right before you
Been searching so long for a way to get through
Swallowed the universe abandoned my youth
I still can't forsake what I feel is true
I was made out of dust by a voice in the wind
To conquer my fears and rise like a king
I will always evolve and never give in
I will follow my dreams cause I know I will win
And if you don't take a stand
You won't understand
We will overcome
We will overcome
It's written in the wind
Set the wheels in motion and rise again
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher
We will overcome
My friend
You might also likeAnd I will not justify what I did
Through the pain sweat and tears I have learned to forgive
So live out your life cause it is a gift
And rise up above; take the whole world with you
I stand here naked, this is my truth
Hold on to your innocence and beauty of youth
And don't ever forget the power lies within
Being born ain't a crime you can be what you want to
And if you don't take a stand
You won't understand
We will overcome
We will overcome
It's written in the wind
Set the wheels in motion and rise again
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher
We will overcome
My friend
I'm feeling powerless
I'm feeling hopeless
I see the world beneath us open to the darkness
I see it everywhere
There's no progress
It's like I'm slowly giving into all the madness
We will overcome
We will overcome
It's written in the wind
Set the wheels in motion and rise again
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher
We will overcome
My friend
I'm feeling powerful
I'm feeling hopeful
I see the world beneath us change to something beautiful
I see it everywhere
There is progress
