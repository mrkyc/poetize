Shot down in daylight
My bullets are songs on the radio
I've been in and out of institutions
Draw another breath on my death row

Hey, I was born a sinner
Michelin Star for dinner
Never been good as a quitter
I push this feed like a Segway

My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house, I'm like the CIA
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house, I'm like the CIA
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house

Curse me, it's alright
Your words don't add to the status quo
And I'm best friends with my shadow
There's no more room on this pedestal
You might also like
Oh, hey, I was born a sinner
Michelin Star for dinner
Never been good as a quitter
I push this feed like a Segway

My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house, I'm like the CIA
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house, I'm like the CIA
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house

W is a watch
A is an apple
R is the rain, rain
(Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey ya)
W is a watch
A is an apple
R is the rain, rain
(Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey ya)
W is a watch
A is an apple
R is the rain, rain
(Hey ya, hey, hey ya, hey ya)
W is a watch
A is an apple
R is the rain, rain
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house, I'm like the CIA
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house, I'm like the CIA
My house, I break the law (Break the law)
In my house

Take another gun (?) (Break the law, break the law)
Breakin' all the laws I'm like the CIA (I'm like the CIA)
I was (?) (Break the law)
To break the vibe on my death row
W is a watch (Break the law, break the law)
A is an apple (I'm like the CIA)
