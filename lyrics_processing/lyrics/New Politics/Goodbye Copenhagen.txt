I'm just another fuckin' useless freak
And everytime I take a look in the mirror
It's like I just wanna go back to sleep
I know it sounds like I'm a little too much but...
I got the right to complain
Sometimes life can be kind of a joke
It's not as easy as it seems
No
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like breaking out!
Goodbye Copenhagen, love
I left my heart, I know it's not enough
Goodbye Copenhagen, love
I'll be back in December
I hope you'll still be there
Do you know the feeling when you're walking down the street, you're
Kinda bored and you don't know what to do
And this dick, he comes up and he bumsa cigarette
When you look back, he's laughing at you
And I remember when it all was easy
I was a rebel with a cause
The funny thing is that now I look back I-
I wonder if I ever was
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like breaking out!
Goodbye Copenhagen, love

I called your house, called your cell, but you're breaking up
Back and forth snapping jaws
Like I had enough
Screams and shout pull my hair what a shit dessert
Yeah life's a bitch, then you marry one
This is love
Can you say this is love?
This is not enough for me
Not for me
Not for me
Goodbye Copenhagen, love
(hey hey hey)
I left my heart, I know it's not enough
(hey hey hey)
Goodbye Copenhagen, love
(hey hey hey)
