Everybody needs a place to call their home
Everybody needs someone to call their own
Even when you're lonely, know you're not alone
You're one of us, one of us, one of us
One of us

(Oh)
Is this your starring role
Or just a cameo?
(Who are you living for, living for, living, oh)
When you can't take no more
'Cause when it rains, it pours
(What are you living for, living for, living)
I don't got much, but I got heart, and soul
I found myself through all the highs, and lows
(Oh)
Will you drown in the pain
Or go dance in the rain?
(What are you living for, living for, living)

Everybody needs a place to call their home
Everybody's skin is different, not their bones
Even when you're lonely, know you're not alone
You're one of us, one of us, one of us
One of us
Bring the sunshine in
The happy days
The hardship, too
We'll find a way
So raise your flag
One last time
Before the day is through, I promise you
That we will laugh about it all
And we'll celebrate the things we've done for years to come
'Cause that's what friends, that's what friends are for
You might also like
(Oh)
What have you done so far?
Are you satisfied?
(Who are you living for, living for, living, oh)
It takes a mighty fall
Before you learn to walk
(What are you living for, living for, living)
'Cause life's too short to take it as it goes
So stand up tall, and let the whole world know
(Oh)
So will you lose the game
Or go and claim your fame?
(What are you living for, living for, living)

Everybody needs a place to call their home
Everybody needs someone to call their own
Even when you're lonely, know you're not alone
You're one of us, one of us, one of us
One of us
Bring the sunshine in
The happy days
The hardship, too
We'll find a way
So raise your flag
One last time
Before the day is through, I promise you
That we will laugh about it all
And we'll celebrate the things we've done for years to come
'Cause that's what friends, that's what friends are for
(That's what friends, that's what friends are for)
(That's what friends, that's what friends are for)

We will laugh about it all
And we'll celebrate the things we've done, the years to come
The good, the bad, the sweet, the sad
We will laugh about it all
And we'll celebrate, 'cause that's what friends
That's what friends are for

You're not alone
You're one of us, one of us, one of us
