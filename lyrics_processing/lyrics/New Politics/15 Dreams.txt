Nothing's ever fair
I must keep moving 'til I get there

Time passing by like the speed of a rocket
The man on the moon still lives in my pocket
You ever feel that life's slipping out of your hands?
I'm just a man living in a machine
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 dreams
Do you ever feel that you're never really good enough?

Stuck on a runway
I can get lifted
Stars in the sky that I just can't find
Never getting home tonight
Stuck on a runway
I can get lifted
Sorry, the pilot's lost his mind
Never getting home tonight

Trying to make a dollar out of 15 dreams
(Never getting home tonight)
I'm just a man living in a machine
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 dreams

Somewhere in the sun
I keep on waiting for my ship to come

Time passing by like the speed of a rocket
The man on the moon still lives in my pocket
You ever feel that life's slipping out of your hands?
I'm just a man living in a machine
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 dreams
Do you ever feel that you're never really good enough?

Stuck on a runway
I can get lifted
Stars in the sky that I just can't find
Never getting home tonight
Stuck on a runway
I can get lifted
Sorry, the pilot's lost his mind
Never getting home tonight

Never getting home tonight
(Trying to make a dollar out of 15 dreams)
Never getting home tonight
(I'm just a man living in a machine
Trying to make a dollar out of 15 dreams)
Let me excel
I keep on climbing 'til I get well
