Summer's come but I don't know why
It's so damn hard for me to, do things right
But maybe if you just let me try
I can make you a believer, make you a believer

You keep me hanging on the edge of time
You keep me hanging on the edge of time

Give me hope, and give me love
Give me whatever I want
Cause what I want is someone, like you
So give me truth
And let us pretend, that we made love til' the end
So give me hope
Love til' the end
We made love til' the end
We made love til' the end

So tell me baby, what's your point of view
Like how am I doing here
Does it lead anywhere?
And is there anyway, for me to be sure
I can make you a believer, make you a believer, yeah
You might also like
You keep me hanging on the edge of time
You keep me hanging on the edge of time

Give me hope, and give me love
Give me whatever I want
Cause what I want is someone, like you
So give me truth
And let us pretend, that we made love til' the end
So give me hope

All she wants is a funky rock and roller
She got the look, that's why she gives the cold shoulder
She keeps it hot even in December
This ain't about the weather, you're too hot
Get out the sweater, I got the beretta
Without the sweater, it's so much better
We could all get wet or just all get wetter
It really doesn't matter, I can make you a believer
You know what they say about rock and roll

Give me hope, and give me love
Give me whatever I want
Cause what I want is someone, like you
So give me truth
And let us pretend, that we made love til' the end
Let us pretend that we made love til' the end
