You walk the streets
Never feel no guilt
You make your money selling guns on the playground
I'm so ashamed
Cause we're all the same
Killing in the name money is the game now
And you're buying bombs
And we pay the price
Eat your lies and we feed it to the children
Is this what you want?
Is this what you need?
You're gonna kill us all to bring peace

My blood
My soul
Is my enemy
My love
My life
Is poison to me
I know it's not how it's supposed to be
Got no choice
No voice
I have no dignity
You might also like
You manipulate
With your bag of tricks
You're playing God with the world on my shoulder
I can't regulate
Cause the world's at stake
We're so lost that we all think it's over
But I'm the one to blame
For this burning pain
It's eating up the world
And we gonna live it in shame
It's hard to maintain
When it's so insane
It's so, so insane

So kids don't listen to your parents
The parents can't teach us
All they ever left was a world in a mess

My blood
My soul
Is my enemy
My love
My life
Is poison to me
I know it's not how it's supposed to be
Got no choice
No voice
I have no dignity
Ah, ah, ah
We got no control
Of the state of our minds
Ah, ah, ah
Now I see that
All I ever lived was a lie
Ah, ah, ah
We're all duped to believe
That there's no way around
There's no way around
There's no way around

My blood
My soul
Is my enemy
My love
My life
Is poison to me
I know it's not how it's supposed to be
Got no choice
No voice
I have no dignity
My blood
My soul
Is my enemy
My love
My life
Is poison to me
I know it's not how it's supposed to be
Got no choice
No voice
I have no dignity
Dignity
