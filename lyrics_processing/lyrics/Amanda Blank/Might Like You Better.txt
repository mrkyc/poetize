Might like you better if we slept together
Might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better baby, let's get together baby
Wanna hold you, get to know you
Show you what I got in my sweater baby
Curly red hair, the bitch in charge
And if we settle on it, boy, I'll make you see stars
Get large, get hard, go fuck, go far
When I touch it watch it fuck see my money and my-y-y
I might like you better baby, let's get together baby
Wanna hold you get to know you
Show you what I got in my sweater baby
Curly red hair, the bitch in charge
And if we settle on it, boy, I'll make you see stars
Get large, get hard, go fuck, go far
When I touch it watch it fuck see my money and my-y-y
Ride no lie just get inside me
Like you better if you just ride me
Grind me, try me, watch me finish
I like you better if you get up in it

Might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
Might like you better if we slept
If we slept, if we slept together
I'm not waiting on ya, don't take to long
Don't waste my time, just take me home
I got something for you believe it's sweet
Let's go
I moan like a cat in heat
Go, go, go, go let low and blow
Let me give you something to grab and hold
Wanna know how you go
I catch you though
Cheap, cheap damn trick
Get off the floor
Cause ya baby, I got what you need
Don't fuck with them chicks, just fuck with me
When were down, we can quit it
We don't need to go together
Just let me hit it once and let me hit it once and under
I might like you better if we slept together
Might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
Might like you better if we slept
If we slept, if we slept together
Just take me home, just, just take me home
Just take me home, just, just take me home
Just take me home, just, just take me home
Just take me home, just, just take me home
