I got so many honeys on my request line
Spendin' all their money for a taste of my time
I don't want 'em 'cause I want you, boo, you're lookin' so fine
And now I'm ready, so ready, baby, give me a sign
If you let me I might let you get a piece of my pie
So break me off, come get me at the front of the line
I got that big big heavy, what you got in mind?
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I'm waitin'
Hey, pretty baby, when you tryin' to leave?
I been beggin', please, all night and waitin' patiently
You know you need me but you greedy, so come on, don't tease
And leave me by myself, beside myself like I can't breathe
And now I'm hurtin', God, I'm hurtin', I'm so weak in the knees
Got your lovin' on my brain, it creeped in like a disease
I'm as sick as can be, I'm at a 103
You got that big big heavy, come and give it to me
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I'm waitin'
You might also likeOh no, here we go, take me home
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'
Oh no, here we go, take me home
I'm waiting, I'm waitin
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball
I'm in love, give you all my love
Gonna give you my love, give you all my love
I give good love, gonna give you good love
I give good love, gonna give you good love
I want your love, I need your love
