Do I got something in my eye?
Do I got shit up on my face or did my hair catch on fire?
Cause you really really staring am I something that you like?
Jeez ask for my number, or you can fly a kite
See I'm bout to get with it, I'm getting ratchet and livid
You think I'm cool and forget it
You feeling froggy then ribbit
Be like banana and split it, before your melon I'll split it
I bet you know what you see, it's all my girls, you deserve a
Beat down, stop, wait
Think about it, think about it
Work, work, run up, if you want some
Hear the drums how they beat, that's how you done
Wait, I should think about it, never mind that's a waste
When this bitch hit the ground
How these Louboutins taste?
I'm sorry, club promoter, let's put this in the past
It's just that bitch kept on staring
So I had to whoop that ass
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down
It's a party on your face, I'm bout to dance on it
Bout to dance on it, bout to dance on it
It's a party on your face, I'm bout to dance on it
Bout to dance on it, bout to dance on it
You win some, you lose some
But her it's her day
You win some, you lose some
But her it's her day
Beat down
It's a party on your face, an I'm bout to dance on it
Bout to dance on it, bout to dance on it
It's a party on your face, an I'm bout to dance on it
Bout to dance on it, bout to dance on it
Stop, wait, think about it
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Check it out ladies don't take no lip
Take no lip, take take no lip
If you rap for you girls, then pump your fist
Pump your fist
Pump pump your fist
Now swing it at the hoe that you think looking funny
If she came with a man then take all his money
It's the year of the woman, gonn grab a can of these whoopin's
And then as soon she looking, ay yo cause she gonn get it
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Ay yo cause she gonn get it
Beat down, beat down, beat down
