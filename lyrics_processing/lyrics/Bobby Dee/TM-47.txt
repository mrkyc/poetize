Well there's no problem
If you have a gun shoot him in the head
That's a sure way to kill him
Bobby Dee
Damn it Bobby
What wrong with these niggas man?

I'm on the block with Glock extensions
Pull up with the choppa, I'm not missing
That nigga want smoke, then we go get him mist
Stop all the cap, boy that's not how you living
You not getting guap, stop bitching
I fuck top notch bitches
These niggas burnt out for thot bitches
Lil boy get the fuck out my business

Walked down on a nigga late night like Thriller
Catch me on the phone posted up with them killers
That boy, he a stain, but he say he a drug dealer
I'm not a junkie I can't do them drugs with you
Claim he the plug so you know I'ma get him
I'ma jug his ass and everyone with him
They won't make a move cuz the choppa gon' babysit them
That boy make a move, I just might make my lady hit him
That boy make a move, I'ma let the .380 hit him
Pull up in Mercedez with dracs and we spray the scene
That boy lookin' crazy I told him stop playin' with me
Pulled up with the racks so that lil bitch start prayin' with me
If she not suckin' dick, that bitch not coming with me
Walked in the club and I spent like a hunnid fifty
Thottie gon fuck on the gang for a hunnid fifty
They would've  for these bitches with big ol' titties

Don't know what you thought what this was but it ain't that
How you got 80 and 10 on the same track
Yo' bitch said she don't want me told me that she not in love with me, funny enough that she came back
Soon as the racks came in
Fuckin' your bitch got her back caved in
I treat that lil ho like a backpace bitch
Why she stand on your money, your racks ain't shit
That bitch want fuck with me just cuz I get it in
Just bought a SRT, I'm not rentin' shit
Even with that Glock, we know that you still a bitch
Monkeys hiding from the island like Gilligan
Pull up with yo  just asked me to hit again
You know he not made for this shit boy then quit it then
Spinnin' yo block in this coupe with this alias
I brought the bag and this bitch like Azalea
Lambo a spider, it came from Australia
My bitch so perfect, you think that I tailored her
My ho is savage, these bitches are scared of her
Glizzy hold 30 I go anywhere with her
And we ain't talkin' hotdogs bitch
Yo' bitch finna sit on this long ass dick
DC sniper, came with a stick
Had a temper tantrum when I throw on this fit, lil bitch
I'm on the block with Glock extensions
Pull up with the choppa, I'm not missing

Stop all the cap, boy that's not how you living

Lil boy get the fuck out my damn business

I got extended clips, no, I'm not reloading
He tryna eat on my scraps, he be freeloading
I had to dump the bitch because she be hoeing
Just copped a pint and the seal gon' let me open
I'm bout to bust in her mouth when she deepthroat it
All on my waist, I got my heat showin'
Got something bigger, don't care 'bout what he totin'
Off with his head put on top of the totem pole
I got these racks just right after I sold my soul
Walked in to the function, come in with a .44
I just left the function, you ask where your shorty go
I might not wrap it, we have an abortion though
Not good at school, no, I'm not on the honor roll
I'm in LA and I'm smoking a lot of dope
What's in my blunt? It's your homie and gelato
Feds runnin down on the  cuz I push cargo
I got some racks in the safe like Wells Fargo
You want some change, you ain't playin' your part though
No, I'm not scared, I'm in every burough
Robbin' they store, bitch, I'm making them furlough
I hit his block and then I gotta lay low
I got a bad bitch, do what I say so
I'm with a savage, he kill for some pesos
Boy, you a stain, best not bring out no bankroll
I'm on the block with Glock extensions
Pull up with the choppa, I'm not missing
That nigga want smoke, then we go get him mist
Stop all the cap, boy that's not how you living
You not getting guap, stop bitching

These niggas burnt out for thot bitches
Lil boy get the fuck out my business

Walk in my trap, bitch we sellin' that ready made
He tried to cut the hard, it broke his razorblade
 off the front like I'm catching the cab
I just sold him some paper, he think it's a tab
I heard these niggas don't like me
I'm sagging it hard,  show lightly
Proud of Prada, nigga, these not no Nikes
And my niggas keep straps like I hang out with dykes
I bought some stocks and I just got some dividends
I fuck her for hours and you just a minuteman
Getting money, man, Christ Dillinger synonyms
Breaking the law, I am not a good citizen
All the bitches I fuck, problematic
I'm making the pack disappear like it's magic
His bitch a philanthropist, lettin' me have at it
We sippin' on wock and I'm livin' so lavish
You a broke nigga so can't put your phone on
I bought me a perc and told my bitch to hold on
Wake up in the morning, I'm putting that pole on
And I got that underarm cuffs like it's roll on
This a real Rolex, bitch, look at the gems in it
Why you bought followers? You still irrelevant
I hate these niggas just like I'm the president
Still fucking your bitch, yes, present tense
Put the dick in her mouth, suck that
She want this pickle, ain't talkin' bout Rugrats
Bitch, what that pussy speak, Ebonics
These junkies be hooked on the dope like it's phonics
You copy my shit I just take it as homage
These niggas can't see me like pics of Muhammad

-Damn nigga, you really gonna make me come in like this?
(yuh, yuh, yuh)
That Glock with a dick make a nigga vibrate
Huh, man we took all his classes, I'm smoking high grade
Huh, keep that water my neck cuz I gotta hydrate
Huh, when I walk and then spot all the bitches migrate
Huh, I don't wait 'til that pussy boy come to my state
Huh, I'll fade every nigga that wanna buy Bape
Fuck Bape, all you niggas is broke but stay buyin' designer, bitch you are the kind that I hate
Huh, and I just found my lighter, I'm sparking that kush up
Fuckin' that bitch, look like I'm doing push up
You talkin' so much about me then say wassup
You don't gotta act like you don't see what's happening
Watching niggas fall off is so tragic and saddening
Passing up niggas like Madden, I'm maddening
My stick is so big and shoot far like a javelin
Darkie so dazzling, take off your head like a mannequin
Damaging faggots like I was the Vatican
Battling niggas ain't nothing but practicing
You got a career? What yo' manager managing
Name one Indian rapper that I am not better than
-I mean, Nav kinda fire if you think about it
-Fuck you
Shut the fuck up, your life, I'm ending
Suck on my nuts, and please, intend it
To make me bust, I just ascended
I'm on the block with Glock extensions

I'm on the block with Glock extensions
