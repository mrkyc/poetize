Hm, tiger, tiger, I feel for you
Illest hunter inside the coupe
Naughty smack yaks with the pupil dap
Chisel at the bars till the toofies crack, and lean beef
Baby got a heart that beats
Roadrunner, tangent, cartoon freak
Obsessed much with the sure to catch bloody mess pending
Crush on coyote 'cause her cause ain't bending
Vickie, vulture, lack the culture and the combination of, the look sucks
Hunter books to slay the prey in any nook
Cranny, cranberry, babble speech dictionary
Hairy knuckle, fuckin' shaving with a razor from zoo-keep Larry
On a mound of breeding well exceeding your target
Output, future speech, I beseech your outlook
Poetically blunt, vasectomy cunt
Don't you ever get lucked 'cause you're bound to get fucked
67 bucks, finger, touch scaly backside
Whale dick running shit, photograph archived
All the time through the night: mental drills from here to Turkey
Chicken worm food, worky-work for my jerky poo
Monkey do junky pee, moat around the titty tree
Kitty scene, lap the teet, lap the wicky-wicked king
Zookeeper own a beeper hitting up the cheater cheetah
For some cheeba late at night, he'll smoke him if he doesn't feed it right (woo, error)

All the people that we know are animals behind mechanical
Devices handed license they could die at any time
Sitting in between the birth canal and incandescent tunnel is the chance
To feed the wild side, feed the fucker right

Out of practice, platy-pussy pack the mattress
Stacked up to ceiling speakin' foul in captions
How many hybrids can we fit in a dorm
Before it starts to look zoo-similar, off-shore
Scoping from the window-sill, telescope, nerdy-skilled
Americana surf song, thunder-thighed people are real
They exist unless you can't make-pretend
You're really all alone in power-animal dens
I'm Jack's naggin' pansy-mind
Today I bitched a lot and had a damn good time
Complicated confiscation of the space behind the face
Replace it with the spongy self-absorbent waste paste
And I'm dense, way to dense to approach
Shallow motherfuckers get evaporated way before
They step into the alpha circle
Drawn in purple droopy nurple-urkle pants, dance till I'm all alone
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
I'm such a fucking animal
That's what I want

That's what I want
You're such a fucking animal
