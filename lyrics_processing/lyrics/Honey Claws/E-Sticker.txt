When I'm done freaking beats in the big leagues
Paper back shovel stacks in my black safe
Black as clouds over towns where the storm breaks
Funnel through this shit emerge holiday
Lizzy lizard breaking out rampage
Pop lock when the solders hot enough
To wreck shop on metal bound together hard rock
Blocks flock to wavelengths and speak civil
Middle shouts out move let your legs wiggle
Peaking out the whole bodily mold
Feeling better than we ever felt before
Got a bruise in my body it makes me woozy
When you say hello I tremble uneasy
Shoot shoot bullets of lust like the movies
Had a baby together named Uzi
Clap clap when the masses have their
Shit together enough to feel what they must
Laugh yellow-faced stencil in grin
E + stickers on the bulletin board
Good karma so I met her last week
She speak to me better than you ever did, settled
Flipping records not quarters I'm bordered
With the sickest crew on the planet and I can stand it
Way above standard way above
Punk amateur mc geeks with hip hop beats
House by itself give us what we need: shelter
You might also likeGot a weapon of choice my voice
Spark a light over joint and coin a phrase
Wake up late fully dressed with rested brains
Captain crunch sugar milk excite my veins
Living well to conquer negativity
Look to sun and moon for true identity
Got a grip on the moshing pit
And the top hat clique and their grandparents alike
Every world nation speak the same language
Dance grooves and bass boom untamed us
Tommy Sahs toggle broads at the jam stations
Get their legs quaking get their heads thinking
Get it together we were all born naked
Fornicating in the grass til our hips can't take it
Fast uncensored dentures are welcome
Animals at heart primal side can't help it
