Now, I'm not talking from experience
But I think I've found magnificence
And at the end of the day you can be hard work
But you're good for me
And though you seem to make my body ache
It's a feeling I appreciate
Which makes it easier when you can be hard work
But you're good for me

This time, I know I won't be proved wrong
This time, to win you gotta lose some
Sometimes, I just wanna give you up right away
But then you go and brighten up my day

I know I'm not wasting my time
For you to be the reason I cry
And no, I'm not gonna lie, you're hard work
But you're good for me
And you're the one that's by my side
When I'm going out of my mind
But 99% of the time, you're hard work
But you're good for me
You might also like
And when I'm losing all my energy
You're like my only working remedy
And when I struggle to breathe it's 'cause you're hard work
But you're good for me
And when I start to feel I've had enough
And my head is feeling kind of rough
And even thinking is tough when you're hard work
But you're good for me

And this high is a feeling that I'm fixed on
I knew it was worth it in the long run
'Cause somehow everything has fell into place
And you can tell by the smile on my face

I know I'm not wasting my time
For you to be the reason I cry
And no, I'm not gonna lie, you're hard work
But you're good for me
And you're the one that's by my side
When I'm going out of my mind
But 99% of the time, you're hard work
But you're good for me
Hmm, hard work
Hmm, hard work
Hmm, you're hard work
But you're good for me
Hmm, hard work
Hmm, hard work
Hmm, you're hard work
But you're good for me

But I'm not running away, no
A little bit of love is all it takes

I know I'm not wasting my time
For you to be the reason I cry
And no, I'm not gonna lie, you're hard work
But you're good for me
And you're the one to be by my side
When I'm going out of my mind
But 99% of the time, you're hard work
But you're good for me

Hmm, hard work
Hmm, hard work
Hmm, you're hard work
But you're good for me
Hmm, hard work
Hmm, hard work
Hmm, you're hard work
But you're good for me
Yeah
