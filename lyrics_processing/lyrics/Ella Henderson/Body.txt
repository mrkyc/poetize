When my mind is running a mile a minute
And my mouth is open but I can't finish (What I wanna say)
It's like you understand it when I don't get it
When I'm complicated, you still listen (To my body)

Every time you touch me, I get closer to the ceiling
Keep on going, till I reach the sky
Give me all your love and I'll do anything to feel it
Keep on going, lay your skin on my

My body
Has never felt quite like this with somebody
I'm never gonna be alone 'cause you got me
And I got you and all of the things that you do to my body
Body, body

When I fall apart and there's too much pressure (Ah-ah)
And I burn your ego and my temper, you never judge
You pick up every piece and put me back together
When I'm laid in your arms, I know you'll never give up on us

Every time you touch me, I get closer to the ceiling
Keep on going till I reach the sky
Give me all your love and I'll do anything to feel it
Keep on going, lay your skin on my

My body
Has never felt quite like this with somebody
I'm never gonna be alone 'cause you got me
And I got you and all of the things that you do to my body
Body, body
Oh

Keep, keep touching
Keep, keep loving
Now that you taught me to love me better
Keep, keep touching
Keep, keep loving
Now that you taught me to love

My body
Has never felt quite like this with somebody
I'm never gonna be alone 'cause you got me
And I got you and all of the things that you do to my body, hm
My body
Has never felt quite like this with somebody
I'm never gonna be alone 'cause you got me
And I got you and all of the things that you do to my body
