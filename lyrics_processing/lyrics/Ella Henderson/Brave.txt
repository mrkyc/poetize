Oh darling, dry your eyes
It'll be alright, just look to the sky now
Come and lay here in my arms
I can feel your heart
I'm by your side now

I'll handle your fears for you
Cry your tears for you
When the rain keeps falling down
I'm standing right here for you
When the rain keeps falling

When trouble wrecks your heart
And the world's gone dark
And your soul is black and blue
We still got love to give, got a lot to live for
We'll pull through
Brave, I'll be brave
Oh, you can pray for me, I'm gon' pray for you
And even when it hurts baby, I'll be brave for you
Ooh, brave
Ooh, 'cause baby, I'll be brave for you
Ooh, brave, ooh, brave
You might also like
Oh darling, just hold my hand
Even when the lights are blinding
I'll take on the bitter pain
I'll do what it takes to see you smiling

No mountain that I wouldn't climb for you
I will rise for you to your heart's desire
And I'll open the sky for you
Set the rain on fire (Fire)

When trouble wrecks your heart
And the world's gone dark
And your soul is black and blue
We still got love to give, got a lot to live for
We'll pull through
Brave, I'll be brave
Oh, you can pray for me, I'm gon' pray for you
And even when it hurts baby, I'll be brave for you
Ooh, brave
Ooh, 'cause baby, I'll be brave for you
Ooh, brave, ooh, brave

I'm gon' be brave, I'm gon' be brave
I'm gon' be brave, I'm gon' be brave
No mountain that I wouldn't climb for you
I'll open the sky for you, oh
When trouble wrecks your heart
And the world's gone dark
And your soul is black and blue
We still got love to give, got a lot to live for
We'll pull through
Brave, I'll be brave
Oh, you can pray for me, I'm gon' pray for you
And even when it hurts baby, I'll be brave for you
Ooh, brave
Ooh, 'cause baby, I'll be brave for you

I'll be brave, I'll be brave
