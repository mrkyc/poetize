Let me start by saying I
I'm doing really well right now
Seven months of therapy
I'm in control of my emotions
How are you getting by?
It's been some time
The doctor says I got issues
I got some demons to work on, work through
And I should forward the bill onto you

Ooh-ooh
Now it's all so black and white
Ooh-ooh
No more reading between the lines

My friends didn't wanna meet ya
'Cause a cheat is always a cheater
My mum didn't wanna know ya
Saw through it 'cause she's seen it all before, yeah
My dad and brothers too
They tried to protect me from people like you
But I didn't wanna see the truth
Guess I'd already fallen for a bit of bad news
Guess I'd already fallen for a bit of bad news
You're bad, you're bad news
You might also like
Oh, to think I nearly drowned
In all of those tears I cried
But now I'm good, I'm getting by
You barely even cross my mind
So thanks for the hurt, thanks for the pain
Thanks to the games you played
Oh, I heard you're with someone else
And that's a damn shame
Now you got a new heart to break

My friends didn't wanna meet ya
'Cause a cheat is always a cheater
My mum didn't wanna know ya
Saw through it 'cause she's seen it all before, yeah
My dad and brothers too
They tried to protect me from people like you
But I didn't wanna see the truth
Guess I'd already fallen for a bit of bad news
Guess I'd already fallen for a bit of bad news

You're a little bit of bad news and now I can see through you
You're a little bit of bad news and I'd hate to be you
You're a little bit of bad news and now I can see through you
You're a little bit of bad news and I'd hate to be you
Oh-oh
My friends didn't wanna meet ya
'Cause a cheat is always a cheater
My mum didn't wanna know ya
Saw through it 'cause she's seen it all before, yeah
My dad and brothers too
They tried to protect me from people like you
But I didn't wanna see the truth
Guess I'd already fallen for a bit of bad news
Guess I'd already fallen, fallen, fallen for you
