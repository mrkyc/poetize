I couldn't help but take the pain
Believe you when you run away
I don't know what to do
All I want is that piece of my heart, back from you

No, I don't care what you tell me
If you really love me
Then love me and just let me go
And let me cry like a woman
Cry like a woman
No, I don't care what you tell me
If you really know me
Then you know these tears ain't for show
And let me cry like a woman
Cry like a woman
If I never had his kisses
Then I wouldn't cry like a woman

Ooh, I feel like I wasted my time
How did I let myself go?
When I left my pride, right at the door
And I did it for you, baby, ooh
Believe you when you run away
Oh, I'm such a fool
All I want is that piece of my heart, back from you
You might also like
No, I don't care what you tell me
If you really love me
Then love me and just let me go
And let me cry like a woman
Cry like a woman
No, I don't care what you tell me
If you really know me
Then you know these tears ain't for show
And let me cry like a woman
Cry like a woman
If I never had his kisses
Then I wouldn't cry like a woman

Just holding onto my heart, baby
You stole it right out my hand, yes you did
Then you took the smile off my face
I hope that makes you feel like a man, now
And my love, I need it back
Oh, give it back baby
What are you ever gonna need it for

No, I don't care what you tell me
If you really love me
Then love me and just let me go
And let me cry like a woman
Cry like a woman
No, I don't care what you tell me
If you really know me
Then you know these tears ain't for show
And let me cry, oh, cry
If I never had his kisses
