I put you first before until it broke me into two
Ignored the warning signs that pointed straight to you
I put you right up on the highest pedestal
And it was easy
Sometimes I hate it that I just couldn't tell
Or maybe I could and I was lying to myself
How did I let you make my life a living hell?
Like it was easy

And if I knew then what I know now
That it would all finally work out
That my heart would mend and I'd pick myself up again

I'm working on my broken, bruised and heartless
Wading through the emptiness and darkness
Now I got you out my head, out my head, out my head
And I'ma make something of me, whatever
Everything I do without you feels better
Now I got you out my head
Out my head, out my head, hm-hm-hm

Now, it don't scare me when the lights go out at night
'Cause I've been through some darker places in my mind
But still you call and swear you wanna make it right
And say you need me
It's just to torture me and to manipulate
I used to fall into your narcissistic ways
It's funny how the sweetest love has turned to hate
And now
You might also like
I'm working on my broken, bruised and heartless
Wading through the emptiness and darkness
Now I got you out my head, out my head, out my head
And I'ma make something of me, whatever
Everything I do without you feels better
Now I got you out my head
Out my head, out my head, hm-hm-hm

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Gonna get you out my head
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Gonna get you out my head

And if I knew then what I know now
That it would finally work out
That my heart would mend and I'd pick myself up again, hm

I'm working on my broken, bruised and heartless
Wading through the emptiness and darkness
Now I got you out my head
Out my head, out my head (Out my head)
And I'ma make something of me, whatever
Everything I do without you feels better
Now I got you out my head
Out my head, out my head, hm-hm-hm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Gonna get you out my head
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
