It's been a while, not seen your face
There's some things I gotta say
I'm not mad, just some regret
Locking down, I kicked you out
Had some girl there in my house
And I wish you the very best

We were meant to be a team
Even when my heart was into
I looked out for you
You didn't look out for me

Every time you screwed around, you blamed me
My mom and dad would've been worried 'bout my health
And I had to face the worst of you to break free
So now I'll take the time to save myself
So thank you for the hell
Yeah, thank you for the hell, hm-hm
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Take the car, keep the keys
Just stay far away from me
Without you here now, I can breathe
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I see my friends, make a start
Try to fix the broken parts
So I feel stronger underneath
You might also like
We were meant to be a team
Said we'd both go fix our issues
We'll be back soon
But you couldn't hold out for me

'Cause every time you screwed around, you blamed me
My mom and dad would've been worried 'bout my health
I had to face the worst of you to break free
And now I'll take the time to save myself
So thank you for the hell
Said thank you for the hell, oh-oh
Thank you for the hell, hm
Thank you, thank you
Oh-oh

'Cause every time you fooled around, you'd break me
My mom and dad have been worried 'bout my health
And I had to cut the chain to set my heart free
Now I'll take the time to save myself
So thank you for the hell
Said thank you for the hell
Thank you for the hell, oh, oh
Thank you, now you're gone I can finally say
