I remember when Daddy said "What do you wanna be?"
I said "I wanna be a mermaid and to live under the sea"
Well, I knew it wouldn't work out as I looked down at my feet
Then my granddad played me my very first record
And that's when it changed for me

It made me smile, made me sing
Made my worries fly away
Lifted me up, set me free
I could be Billie Holiday
And they say life's hard to figure out when in reality
You gotta sit back, just relax
And let it happen naturally

I went to sit by the keys to work on my first song
I had the melodies in my head
But they were coming out all wrong
Then I worked out some harmonies
That went oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And then that sweet sound spoke to me
And told me where I belong

It made me smile, made me sing
Made my worries fly away
Lifted me up, set me free
I could be Billie Holiday
And they say life's hard to figure out when in reality
You gotta sit back, just relax
And let it happen naturally
You might also like
Ooh, fly away
Ooh, so naturally
Ooh, take the stress away
'Cause I know, yeah I know
It'll make you feel alright
Yeah

It made me smile, made me sing
Made my worries fly away
Lifted me up, set me free
I could be Billie Holiday
And they say life's hard to figure out when in reality
You gotta sit back, just relax
And let it happen naturally

Gotta sit back, just relax and let it happen naturally
Gotta sit back, just relax and let it happen naturally
Gotta sit back, just relax and let it happen naturally
Gotta sit back, just relax and let it happen naturally
(Sit back, relax, happen naturally)
(Sit back, relax, happen naturally)
(Sit back, relax, happen naturally)
