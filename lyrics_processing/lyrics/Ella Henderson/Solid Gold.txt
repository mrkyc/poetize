We've been told too many stories, that the writings on the wall
Feel my soul, feel my warm and wicked thirst
Now, I'm free of all my troubles
And I'm shaking off the curse

I've been arguing with the voices in my mind
I've been rolling round like a penny on the side
And I'm here on my knees , so Lord help me out
Oh, heaven lift me up and put my feet back on the ground
I tried to walk a mile with the shackles on my shoes
Ain't hard to risk it all when you've got nothing to lose
They say he can drop the shadows of my sins
So I'm knocking on the door, until the big guy let's me in

Look around, all you see is solid gold
We've been told too many stories, that the writings on the wall
Feel my soul, feel my warm and wicked thirst
Now, I'm free of all my troubles
And I'm shaking off the curse
'Cause, I've got one more round to go
Tell the devil, go hit the road
Leave your dirt at the door
'Cause, we've got one more round to go
And I've been working to the bone
Tell my baby, I'm coming home
Pour it up, let it roll
'Cause, we've got one more round to go

You try and play it right, but you end up on your own
Stand up and roll the dice, before your days are gone
They try to shoot me down, like a rabbit on the run
But how you gonna kill me, with no bullet in the gun

Look around, all you see is solid gold
We've been told too many stories, that the writings on the wall
Feel my soul, feel my warm wicked thirst
Now, I'm free of all my troubles
And I'm shaking off the curse
'Cause, I've got one more round to go
Tell the devil, go hit the road
Leave your dirt at the door
'Cause, we've got one more round to go
And I've been working to the bone
Tell my baby, I'm coming home
Pour it up, let it roll
'Cause, we've got one more round to go

'Cause I, I've lost my self control
So I, oh, I pray and I pray and I pray
Solid gold
Look around, all you see is solid gold
We've been told too many stories, that the writings on the wall
Feel my soul, feel my warm and wicked thirst
Now, I'm free of all my troubles
And I'm shaking off the curse
'Cause, I've got one more round to go
Tell the devil, go hit the road
Leave your dirt at the door
'Cause, we've got one more round to go
And I've been working to the bone
Tell my baby, I'm coming home
Pour it up, let it roll
'Cause, We've got one more round to go
(Cause, we've got one more round to go)

'Cause, I've got one more round to go
Tell the devil to go hit the road
'Cause, we've got one more round to go
And I've been working to the bone
Tell my baby, I'm coming home
Pour it up, let it roll
'Cause, we've got one more round to go
'Cause, I've got one more round to go
Tell the devil to go hit the road
We've got one more round to go
And I've been working to the bone
Tell my baby, I'm coming home
Pour it up, let it roll
