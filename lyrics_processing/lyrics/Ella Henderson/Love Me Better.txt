You're sitting across the room
My eyes are on you
I don't know how to act, while you're holding her hand
And I know there was a moment when you nearly put your heart out on the line
And I did mine
And I know I shouldn't think about it, but I think about you all the time, why?

She's all colour
And you're all black and white
And when you hold each other
You know something just ain't right
She'll never love you better
And she can't love you better if she tried
'Cause no-one else could love you like I would
I wish that I could treat you so damn good
I'd never leave your side
And baby I, I wanna dance with you until the morning light
I wish you'd never met her
'Cause I could love you better

Known you since we were 10
My only best friend
And now I'm so afraid of losing you, of losing my way
Do you remember all the parties where we'd drink 'til we threw up at 17, so naive
And under the stars in the garden where we played when we grew up, just you and me and all our dreams
You might also like
She's all colour
And you're all black and white
And when you hold each other
You know something just ain't right
She'll never love you better
And she can't love you better if she tried
'Cause no one else could love you like I would
I wish that I could as I'd treat you so damn good
I'd never leave your side
And baby I, I wanna dance with you until the morning light
I wish you'd never met her
'Cause I could love you better

Love you better
I'd love you better

She's all colour
And you're all black and white
And when you hold each other
I know something just ain't right
She'll never love you better
And she can't love you better if she tried
'Cause no one else could love you like I would
I wish that i could I'd treat you so damn good
I'd never leave your side
And baby I, I wanna dance with you until the morning light
I wish I could forget ya
