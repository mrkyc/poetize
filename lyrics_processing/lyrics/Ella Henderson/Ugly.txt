Too thin, too smart
Monday, don't fit in my jeans, stretch marks
Dark circles under my eyes
But no one wants to hear about that

I'm sick of putting labels on myself
Trying to fit in, trying to act like I'm somebody else
I'm taking all this pressure off myself
And I'm gon' say something for me, that's real

It's okay to be lost, to feel lonely
Sometimes I just don't know what I'm doing
One day I'm beautiful, then I'm ugly
But those days, they remind me that I'm human
So go ahead and rip, tear me apart
'Cause I'm not afraid of my flaws
If the scars on my skin make me ugly
Then let's get ugly

I know what they want
Bright lights, highlighter, contour on
Too scared to be vulnerable
But when did we become afraid of that?

I'm tired of all the pretty little lies
Don't need a thousand likes
To know that we're still beautiful inside
It's time to have the time of our lives
And say something real

It's okay to be lost, to feel lonely
Sometimes I just don't know what I'm doing
One day I'm beautiful, then I'm ugly
But those days, they remind me that I'm human
So go ahead and rip, tear me apart
'Cause I'm not afraid of my flaws
If the scars on my skin make me ugly
Then let's get ugly

I'm a recipe for disaster
Or I could be the recipe for
The happiest ever after, oh-oh
I'm a recipe for disaster
Or I could be the recipe for
The happiest ever after, oh-oh

It's okay to be lost, tofeel lonely
Sometimes I just don't know what I'm doing
One day I'm beautiful, then I'm ugly
But those days, they remind me that I'm human
So go ahead and rip, tear me apart
'Cause I'm not afraid of my flaws
If the scars on my skin make me ugly
Then let's get ugly
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Let's get ugly
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Hmm-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
