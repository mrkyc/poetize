I was the target, you were the weapon
What a big mistake
Out of the silence there you appear
And I suffocate
"Didn't mean to ever hurt you"
You'd say with that look in your eye
While I just die inside
Started to wonder, where did the light go?
As we start to fade

Hearing the sirens in my head
I tell 'em go home
Gotta get this off of my chest

Round all your weapons, ready on the load
Now that you love me again
I'm ready for you, ready for the show
Where you play the part of pretend
So try hit me down, shoot to the ground
Aim for my heart and we fall apart
Round all your weapons
Now you'd say you love me again
You might also like
You toss the bullet right in my eye line
What a risk you took
Say that you need me but I don't believe it
Think my heart went numb
When you told me that you're sorry
You'd say with that look in your eye
While I just die inside
And after the battle, thought it was over
But you won't give up

Hearing the sirens in my head
I tell 'em go home
Gotta get this off of my chest

Round all your weapons, ready on the load
Now that you love me again
I'm ready for you, ready for the show
Where you play the part of pretend
So try hit me down, shoot to the ground
Aim for my heart and we fall apart
Round all your weapons
Now you'd say you love me again
Miss me, miss me
Never gonna kiss me again
Miss me, miss me
Never gonna kiss me again
Miss me, miss me
Never gonna kiss me again
(Never gonna kiss me)
Miss me, miss me
Never gonna kiss me again

Round all your weapons, ready on the load
Now that you love me again
I'm ready for you, ready for the show
Where you play the part of pretend
So try hit me down, shoot to the ground
Aim for my heart and we fall apart
Round all your weapons
