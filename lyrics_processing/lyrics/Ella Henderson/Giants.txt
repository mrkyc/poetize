I know what it's like to be falling small
In a corner with your back up against the wall
Caught up in a trap and you can't get out
I know what it is when it's hard to breathe
'Cause you turn into your own worst enemy
Blaming everything on yourself right now

And even the best get it wrong sometimes
We take a left when we should have turned right

Don't let the fear keep you from climbin'
And if you fall to the ground, just keep tryin'
Head up in the clouds, never lookin' down
Nothing's gonna stop us this time 'round
We could be giants, whoa, you and I
We could be giants, giants, oh-oh

You just walk on by when they criticise
Try to tear you apart with their dirty lies
They will never win, they don't understand

That even the best get it wrong sometimes
So don't live with regret or you'll lose your mind, yeah
You might also like
Don't let the fear keep you from climbin'
And if you fall to the ground, just keep tryin'
Head up in the clouds, never lookin' down
Nothing's gonna stop us this time 'round
We could be giants, whoa, you and I
We could be giants, giants, oh-oh

We stand tall like giants
We stand tall like giants
We stand tall like giants
We stand tall like giants

Don't let the fear keep you from climbin'
And if you fall to the ground, just keep tryin'
Head up in the clouds, never lookin' down
Nothing's gonna stop us this time 'round
We could be giants, whoa, you and I
We could be giants, giants

We stand tall like giants (Like giants)
We stand tall like giants (Like giants)
We stand tall like giants (No, no)
We stand tall like giants
