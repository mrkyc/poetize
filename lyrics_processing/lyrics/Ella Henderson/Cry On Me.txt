Another fight without the healing, tears stacked to the ceiling
Cold, underwater breathing
I'm all yours
You know I struggle with some issues and
I know you carry yours with you
But together we can get through it
If we talk

I don't know if I'm allowed to say this
If you fall apart you can rely on me
I'm not asking you to be the bravest
Just want you to know

You can cry on me
And if it gets too much, you're safe to cry on me
Darling, I'll take it all, I'll take it all, you see
We all fuck it up sometimes
But there's still stars in our eyes
When you're lost in between
You can cry on me

I know our life is like a circus
We ain't doing it on purpose but
I don't need it to be perfect
To be yours
'Cause even when all the little things play on my mind
Like when I hit the bottle, you bottle inside
But as long as I wake up to you, it's alright
It's enough
You might also like
And I don't know if I'm allowed to say this
If you fall apart you can rely on me
I'm not asking you to be the bravest
Just want you to know

You can cry on me
And if it gets too much, you're safe to cry on me
Darling, I'll take it all, I'll take it all, you see
We all fuck it up sometimes
But there's still stars in our eyes
When you're lost in between
You can cry on me
Cry on me, cry on me
Darling, I'll take it all, yeah, you can cry on me

We can play this song that's been in our heads
We can hear the words that we never said
Yeah, you know I got you

You can cry on me
And if it gets too much, you're safe to cry on me
Darling, I'll take it all, I'll take it all, you see
We all fuck it up sometimes
But there's still stars in our eyes
When you're lost in between, yeah
You can cry on me
Cry on me, cry on me
Darling, I'll take it all, yeah, you can cry on me
Cry on me, cry on me
