Would you be
Everything you wanted in a lover and an accomplice?
Could you be her?
Would you feel together and inebriated?
Enabling of a fable
We were never meant to be but together

Did you mean
To misinterpret images of our innocence?
On vestiges of virtue
Would you feel pity for the masses?
We were adding and subtracting
With scandals that we made together

I want to say what lovers say to you
I want to feel what lovers feel with you
I want to do it with you
The songs that matter the way we used to do
I want to do what lovers do with you
I want to walk the edge of the earth with you
I want to say it to you the minute we feel the heat

Would you be my lover?
My lover?
My lover?
Would you be my lover?
My lover?
My lover?
Would you be?

In my dream
We split apart the ocean
In a single heated motion
And we settled an agreement with glee
Our dangerous liaisons
And clandestine creation myths were fine with me

I want to do what lovers do with you
I want to walk the edge of the earth with you
I want to say it to you the minute we feel the heat

Would you be my lover?
My lover?
My lover?
Would you be?

I want to say what lovers say to you
I want to feel what lovers feel with you
I want to do it with you
The songs that matter the way we used to

I want to say what lovers say to you
I want to feel what lovers feel with you
I want to do it with you
The songs that matter the way we used to do
I want to do what lovers do with you
I want to walk the edge of the earth with you
I want to say it to you the minute we feel the heat
