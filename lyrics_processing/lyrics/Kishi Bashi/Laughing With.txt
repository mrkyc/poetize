No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God when they're starving or freezing or so very poor
No one laughs at God when the doctor calls after some routine tests
No one's laughing at God when it's gotten real late
And their kid's not back from that party yet

No one laughs at God when their airplane start to uncontrollably shake
No one's laughing at God when they see the one they love
Hand in hand with someone else and they hope that they're mistaken
No one laughs at God when the cops knock on their door and they say
"We've got some bad news, sir"
No one's laughing at God when there's a famine or fire or flood

But God can be funny
At a cocktail party when listening to a good God-themed joke, or
Or when the crazies said He hates us
And they get so red in the head you think they're about to choke
But God can be funny
When told He'll give you money if you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie who does magic like Houdini
Or grants wishes like Jiminy Cricket and Santa Claus
God can be so hilarious, ha-ha
Ha-ha

No one laughs at God in a hospital
No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God when they've lost all they've got
And they don't know what for
No one laughs at God on the day they realize
That the last sight they'll ever see is a pair of hateful eyes
No one's laughing at God when they're saying their goodbyes

But God can be funny
At a cocktail party when listening to a good God-themed joke, or
When the crazies said He hates us
And they get so red in the head you think they're about to choke
But God can be funny
When told He'll give you money if you just pray the right way
And when presented like a genie who does magic like Houdini
