And if you want take your hands and cover me
And if you can let your breath discover me
And if the bright of the sun is smothering
Come here and close your eyes with me

And if you lay your hands on the Earth
And picture yourself as a delicate bird
No one can dare deny you paint the sky
With the colorful state of your heart

With your heart, with your heart
They can never tear us apart
From the bright to the dark
Of the colorful state of your heart

Does it hurt when their eyes discover you?
Does the breadth of the divide carry through?
Will the weight of the world leave you black and blue?
Come here and close your eyes with me

Put the sun, the moon in reverse
Steady your feet in the sand and surf
We can live on and on and spreading the songs of the
Colorful state of your heart

Of your heart, with my heart
They can never tear us apart

Sunsets, sunrising
I want to watch 'em with you, baby
Someday, when it's better
I wanna live 'em with you
Sunsets, sunrising
I want to watch 'em with you baby
One day, when we're together
I wanna live 'em with you

And if you lay your hands on the Earth
And settled your eyes in the colorful world
Will you dream on?
And if the sun and moon were reversed
And you emptied your heart in the sand and surf
Can you belong?
Will you dream on?
(Will you dream on?)
(Will you dream on?)
(Will you dream on?)
(Will you dream on?)
Sunsets, sunrising
I want to watch 'em with you
One day, when we're together
I wanna live 'em with you
