A room filled up with faces and the air so thick I taste it
Locking lips like they all wasted, tangled hips like it's a spaceship
Heavy heads are racing down the hallways to the basement
Where the darkness fills the space and they can feel themselves erasing
Can you feel yourself erasing?
They're bursting at the corners as the ceiling's getting shorter
And I'm stuck between a talker and a VHS recorder
The heat seeps through the border as our ice melts down to water
Can you feel it getting smaller?

I need to be solo
Freedom in the mono
Find a space and let go
I need to be solo, solo
Now I'm breathing in and I'm breathing out
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I'm breathing in and I'm breathing out
Breathing in and I'm breathing out

Their mouths are dripping dryer as their souls are slipping higher
It's like treading on a wire laced with kerosene and fire
The night will soon expire as their bodies soon retire
Limbs entangled in kaleidoscopes of prima donna choirs
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

I need to be solo
Freedom in the mono
Find a space and let go
I need to be solo, solo
Now I'm breathing in and I'm breathing out
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I'm breathing in and I'm breathing out
Breathing in and I'm breathing out

I need to be solo
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Freedom in the mono
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Find a space and let go
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I need to be solo, solo
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I need to be solo
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Freedom in the mono
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
Find a space and let go
Breathing in and I'm breathing out
I need to be solo, solo
