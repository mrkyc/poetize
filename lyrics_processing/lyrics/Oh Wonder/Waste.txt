There's a space in between
Like a grey evergreen
Where the hurt never meant
Stops to linger
On the pavement below
See a crack that I know
All the corners of you
All the bones that I knew
I said I would never come back
Screaming at the walls in jet black
Hurt until my words are out flat
Can I whisper it back?

What a waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone
A waste, what a waste
What a waste to be so alone

There's a space in between
Like a grey evergreen
Where the hurt never meant

On the pavement below
See a crack that I know
All the corners of you
All the bones that I knew
I said I would never come back
Screaming at the walls in jet black
Hurt until my words are out flat
Can I whisper it back?
