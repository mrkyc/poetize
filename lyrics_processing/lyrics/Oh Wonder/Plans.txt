Made a home in a basement
Didn't think that I'd need the light
'Cause all these plans I've been making
Get me out of here in time
But it's always two steps backwards
Too much gravity to feel the highs
And all these plans I've been chasing
Getting caught up and wasted

I don't know where the money goes
I get broke as the city glows
Shines bright as I sink down low
Down low

But I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know?
Gonna build a paper plane to float to you
You know, don't you know?
We'll be scraping the skies with our fingertips
Screaming "This is the life, we were born for this"
See I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
You might also like
I've got a hope in the headlights
Stood still but I'm feeling fine
'Cause all these plans I've been making
Will get me out of here in time
But it's always two steps backwards
Too much gravity to feel the highs
And all these plans I've been chasing
Getting caught up and wasted

I don't know where the money goes
I get broke as the city glows
Shines bright as I sink down low
Down low

But I've got plans to get to you
You know, don't you know?
Gonna build a paper plane to float to you
You know, don't you know?
We'll be scraping the skies with our fingertips
Screaming "This is the life, we were born for this"
See I've got plans to get to you
