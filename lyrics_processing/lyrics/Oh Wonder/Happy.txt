Never thought I'd be happy
Never thought I'd be happy

I didn't think that I'd see you here tonight
But there's something kinda nice about it
It's been a year since you gave me back my love
And I wonder how you've been without it

You're holding someone close
Should hurt, somehow it don't
I guess that's how I know I've finally let you go

I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new
Never thought I'd be happy to see you do the things we do
With somebody else, it's like you're more yourself
Oh, I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new

Never thought I'd be happy
Never thought I'd be happy

Spent all my weekends pretending I was fine
Just to get you out my mind for an evening (For an evening)
I used to wish you would never find the one
But it's good to see you loved, let's call it even
You might also like
You're holding someone close
Should hurt, somehow it don't
I guess that's how I know I've finally let you go

I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new
Never thought I'd be happy to see you do the things we do
With somebody else, it's like
You're more yourself
Oh, I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new

So many nights of barely sleeping
Wide awake and dreaming
I wanted you back (I wanted you back)
It's clear we're good without each other
Dancing with another
It's better like that

I never thought I'd be happy
Never thought I'd be happy
With somebody else, it's like
You're more yourself
Oh, I never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new
Never thought I'd be happy to see you with somebody new
Never thought I'd be happy to see you do the things we do
With somebody else, it's like you're more yourself
