It's gettin' late now
And everybody's headin' out
Back into the night, into the street light
Walking the yellow lines
It's getting hard now
To get you out my mind
I knew it was you, I knew it was you
You incredible, incredible

You see, I loved you more than I loved myself, can't believe I had you
I need you more than I need myself, can't believe I had you

Better that I lost you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Better that I lost you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
You might also like
Too late now
There ain't no miracles
That was just some shit a stranger told you
To make you carry on, well, fuck the carry on
It's getting hard now
Can't be alone with this guy
Keeps ratting me out, keeps writing me off
You incredible, so incredible
More than it all

You see, I loved you more than I loved myself, can't believe I had you
I need you more than I need myself, can't believe I had you

Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you (You incredible, so incredible)
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you (More than it all)
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you (More than it all)
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you (More than it all)
Better that I lost you
Better that I, better that I lost you
