I'm getting high, getting high
Getting high on humans

Sitting in the next seat, dead heat summer
Staring at the ground in a lucid light
I can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
Running round my head in a holy fire
Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
Freshen up the air underneath the streets
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide

And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy

'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)

Elevate the headstrong dead long halo
Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
I can make your day glow sun to rainbow
Colour in your step, let me lose your mind
Animate the air with a stone cold question
Do you have the time? Do you hate your life?
Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
Don't run, don't hide

And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
We're making waves of conversation
Got a rush of energy

'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
And I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans

We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop, we won't stop
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop, no, we won't stop
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop lighting our minds up
We ride up, we slide up
We won't stop lighting our minds up
'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans
Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
And I'm getting high, getting high
I'm getting high on humans

(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
(I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
