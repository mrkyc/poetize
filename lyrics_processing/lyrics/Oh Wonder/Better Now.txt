You've been through it all
And I'll wait for the call just to know
If you're better now

Twenty-two hours, pacing the room
Praying for you, hot cup of coffee
They said you're sleeping, no news is good
Nothing to do, cold cup of coffee

Never been scared about the future
Don't think I'll make it if I lose you

So I hope you're feeling better now, better now
Better now, better now
Yeah, I hope you're feeling better now, better now
And they've lifted the dark clouds
'Cause you've been through it all
And I'll wait for the call just to know
If you're better now

Forty-two hours, the endless bleep
Vending machine, hot cup of coffee
I brought you flowers, wish you could see
Yellows and greens (Yeah), cold cup of coffee
You might also like
Never been scared about the future
Don't think I'll make it if I lose you (Lose you)

So I hope you're feeling better now, better now
Better now, better now
Yeah, I hope you're feeling better now, better now
And they've lifted the dark clouds
'Cause you've been through it all
And I'll wait for the call just to know

I hope you're better now
(And I hope you're feeling better now)
I'll do anything for you to be better now
(Someday)
Better now, I hope you're feeling better now
And I hope you're feeling better, better now
And I hope you're feeling better now
And I hope you're feeling better, better now
I hope you're feeling better now
And I hope you're feeling better, better now
And I hope you're feeling better now

So I hope you're feeling better now, better now (Better now, someday)
Better now, better now
Yeah, I hope you're feeling better now, better now (Better now)
And they've lifted the dark clouds
'Cause you've been through it all
And I'll wait for the call just to know
