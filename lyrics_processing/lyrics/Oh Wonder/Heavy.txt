I could be the only, I could be the only one

You got that throne
Baby you got that throne
That golden majestic glow
Delight, delight, delight, delight
And I got that hope
Ready electric go, go
Super volcano flow
Delight, delight, delight, delight

And I could hold you endlessly
Ultralife just you and me
Oh my heart is aching
Feel my body breaking
There's magic in the way you move
Stop the world it's only you
Oh my heart is waking
'Cause I could be your one and only

We can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until we're too bright, all night, all night
Yeah, we can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until we're too bright, all night, all night
You might also like
I could be the only, I could be the only one

You got that way
Baby you got the way with
Flying me outer space
Delight, delight, delight, delight
And I got that taste
Hope in a one night blaze
That animalistic chase (da dee, da de)
Delight, delight, delight, delight

And I could hold you endlessly
Ultralife just you and me
Oh my heart is aching
Feel my body breaking
There's magic in the way you move
Stop the world it's only you
Oh my heart is waking
'Cause I could be your one and only

We can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until we're too bright, all night, all night
We can get heavy on it all night, all night, all night
Shoot into the sky until we're too bright, all night, all night
I could be the only, I could be the only one

Da dee, da de, da dee, da de, da dee
I could be the only, I could be the only one
Da dee, da de, da dee, da de, da dee
I could be the only, I could be the only one
Da dee, da de, da dee, da de, da dee
I could be the only, I could be the only one
Da dee, da de, da dee, da de, da dee
