Like two satellites in separate orbit
Like a quiet life that's slowly distorted
I was so lonely in love
I guess I was never enough
Like two chemicals erupting in thunder
Up high in vertigo, you left me to wonder
I was so lonely in love
I guess I was never enough

'Cause you were the best thing for me
Stole my mind and found my dreams
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Best thing for me
Open the doors and set me free
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings

Like two radios, our frequency fading
Why can't we start again without tessellating
I was so lonely in love
I guess I was never enough
You might also likeLike the afterglow, your words were a million
Cut short, now heaven knows a love without feeling
I was so lonely in love
I guess I was never enough

'Cause you were the best thing for me
Stole my mind and found my dreams
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Best thing for me
Open the doors and set me free
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings

Stop pulling my heart strings, my heart strings
You got a grip on my heart strings and I don't wanna take it no more
Stop pulling my heart strings, my heart strings
You got a grip on my heart strings and I don't wanna take it no more

'Cause you were the best thing for me
Stole my mind and found my dreams
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Best thing for me
Open the doors and set me free
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
Heart strings, heart strings
Baby, if only you could see heart strings, heart strings
