I don't like to fight
I told you once and here's the twice
Your words like spider bites
On my chest, burning red

Oh, I'ma give up, hold my hands up
Wave a white flag, say I fucked up
My bad, that was my bad
I'ma give up, hold my hands up
Wave a white flag, say I fucked up
My bad, that was my bad

But it takes two to break a heart
Two to break
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break a heart
Two to break
Two to break
It takes two to break
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break
Two to break
It takes two to break
It takes two to break a heart

I shared it with a stranger, I whispered to a friend
Walking laps to answer when or should it end
I see you in my future, the outlines kinda faint
Tell myself to hold on, have a little faith

So I'ma give up (Hold my hands up)
Wave a white flag (Say I fucked up)
(My bad) Say I fucked up, (That was my bad) that was my bad
But you're holding me up (Holding me up)
Caught in the rush (Caught in the rush)
And calling it love (Calling it love)
That was your bad

It takes two to break a heart
Two to break
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break a heart
Two to break
Two to break
It takes two to break
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break
Two to break
It takes two to break
It takes two to break a heart
It takes two to break a heart
Two to break
Two to break
It takes two to break
