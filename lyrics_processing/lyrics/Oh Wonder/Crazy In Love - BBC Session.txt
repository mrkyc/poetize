I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I'll touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I still don't understand just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss, got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love, got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is?
Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, there ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you
'Cause I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
You might also like
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss, got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love, got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

'Cause your love's got the best of me
Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
You got me, you got me
'Cause your love's got the best of me
Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
You got me
You got me
You got me
You got me

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss, got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love, got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
