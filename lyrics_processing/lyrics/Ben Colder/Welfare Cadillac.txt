I guess all I really own is ten kids and a wife
This house I live in is mine but it's really a shack
But I've always managed somehow to drive me a brand new Cadillac
The backdoor steps they done fell plumb down
The front screen door's off and laying somewhere out there on the ground
The wind just now whooped up another piece of that tar roofing off the back
I sure hope it don't skin up that new Cadillac
The front porch posts fell loose at the bottom
It don't make no sense to fix 'em cause that floor's just too darn rotten
In the winter sometimes we have snow blowing through the cracks
If it gets too bad we all just pile up and sleep out there in that new Cadillac
I know the place ain't much but I sure don't pay no rent
And I get a check the first of every month from this here Federal Government
Every Wednesday I get the commodities sometime four or five sacks
I always Pick 'em up down at the welfare office driving that new Cadillac
Some folks say I'm crazy and I've even been called a fool
But my kids get free books and all them there free lunches at school
But we get beer and crackfood and man they give us flour by the sack
Course them welfare checks they meet the payments on this new Cadillac
Now the way that I see it these other folks are the fools
They're working and paying taxes just to send my younguns to school
The Salvation Army cuts their hair and gives them clothes to weear on their backs
So we can dress up and ride along and show off this new Cadillac
But things are still gonna get better yet at least that's what I understand
They tell me this new President done put in a whole new powerty plan
He's gonna send us poor folks money we're gonna get it out there in stacks
