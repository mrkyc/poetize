I'll fight them finance people to the end
Here's my deliquent payment and I'll give you some to boot
Now give me back my car and take my loot
They said I think you're just a little bit late
We can't mess around while you procrastinate
We accutioned off your car you know that's the way we are
Sorry you're a little too late
Then I had to catch the bus to get to work on time
I missed the one at eight and barely caught the one at nine
I finally got to work about a quarter after ten
I went to tell the foreman where I'd been
He said I think you're just a little bit late
And Ben that's the kind of thing I hate
I don't wanna make you sore but we can't use you anymore
Sorry you're a little too late
Then my wife packed up and left me
I said you can't do that to me
I guess I'll have to show her what a lover I can be
So I bought a dozen roses and I said baby please come home
Big ole Ben can't stand to be alone
She said I think you're just a little bit late
You see I went and got myself another mate
He's handsomer than you he's got a car he's sober too
Sorry you're a little too late
Well after the divorce I ended up without a dime
You can see I was forced to lead a life of sin and crime
I gambled and I plundered and I smoked and cursed and drank
Even tried to rob the local bank
They said I think you're just a little bit late
You see there's nothing in our vault for you to take
You're the second crook today the other one got away
Sorry you're a little too late
Well the time I spent in jail has made me see that I was wrong
And I've decided to repent and take it easy from now on
But when I die and climb those golden stairs on Judgement Day
The man will probably look at me and say
I think you're just a little bit late
We're all full up right now you'll have to wait
Why don't you go on down below if somethin' breaks we'll let you know
