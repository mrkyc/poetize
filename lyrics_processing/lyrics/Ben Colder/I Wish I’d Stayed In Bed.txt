Well I wish I hadn't a got up this morning
I wish I'd a stayed in the bed
Cause when I got up
There on the dresser was a note and here's what it said
If you thought I was asleep when you snuck in
About a quarter past three but I wadn't you see
Cause you didn't see me seeing you sneakin' in again
(Ra da da dat whoa ho ra da da dat whoa ho)
Well there I stood a hangin' on the dresser
With a hangover hangin' over me
Well I read your note from start to finish
Well it said you were finished with me
Well it wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't felt so bad
But I felt so bad mostly in my head
When I read what your letter said I wish I'd stayed in bed
When I got up this morning outta that nice warm sack
I read what you wrote and my poor heart broke
I felt like crawlin' right back in the sack
Gonna pick up the phone call up the paper and run me a classified ad
To my darlin' wife the love of my life sayin' sorry I treated you so bad
Well the ads gonna read I'm smartin' at the heart
And a smartin' eart really tears you apart
If the smartin' in your heart smarts like the smartin' in my heart
Did you ever get up in the morning like I got up this morning
Well I guess you have cause everybody does you can't sleep all your life
I'm gonna pick up the phone call up the paper and run me a classified ad
To my darlin' wife the love of my life sayin' sorry I treated you so bad
Well the ads gonna read I'm smartin' at the heart and a smartin' heart
Really tears you apart if the smartin' in your heart
Smarts like the smartin' in my heart smarts
