Oh, I asked her for water, she brought me gasoline
That's the troublingest woman, that I ever seen
The church bell tollin', the hearse come driving slow
The church bell tollin', the hearse come driving slow
I hope my baby, don't leave me no more
Oh tell me baby, when are you coming back home?
Oh tell me baby, when are you coming back home?
