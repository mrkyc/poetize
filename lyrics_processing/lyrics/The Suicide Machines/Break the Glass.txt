Break me!
Myself!

There's some things about myself I can't control yet
It happens time and time again when I'm trying to be
Well I smash it down and break it down when I'm trying to be
Well it's such a shame it's sad to say there's nothing to see there
Well I don't wanna talk about it, you know I can't live without it
It's a stupid fucking shame...
And every time I think about it
I think I'm so lame

I break the glass, I break it down (down)
I break the glass, I break it down (down)
I break the glass, I break it down (down)
I break the glass, I break it down
Go!

What's your story, what's your sign?
No, I can't agree
Well you know you'll never get it in this life for free
You can blow it down and break the glass
Break my heart in two
But you'd better be prepared it's such a shock
There's nothing there
Fill me up because I'm empty
Why couldn't I just have kept me
You know it really fucking sucks...
And when I try to talk about it the words seem to get stuck

I break the glass, I break it down (down)
I break the glass, I break it down (down)
I break the glass, I break it down (down)
I break the glass, I break it down
