I'm not the same as I was when I was young, yeah
And neither are you
There's been a lot of changes in the both of us
You said you see that too

I've wasted such a lot of time to find I was
Looking at the wrong things
If it's an apology you're waiting for
You could wait a long time

Yelling "It's over the "
Saying "It's over the "
Saying "It's over the "
Saying "It's over the "

Said "Life really sucks with you"
And I've wasted such a lotta time too
Just to feel like a zero
Life really sucks when I'm near you
Yeah, you know, I feel like a zero
I've wasted such a lotta time too
Just to feel like a zero

You're not the only one 
You said I broke your heart
It would've been the the other way around when I was young
But sooner or later we've all got to grow up

I've wasted such a lot of time to find I was
Looking at the wrong things
If it's an apology you're waiting for
You could wait a long time

Saying "It's not my fault"
Saying "It's over the "
Saying "It's over the "
Saying "It's over the "

Said "Life really sucks with you"
I've wasted such a lotta time too
Just to feel like a zero
Life really sucks when I'm near you
Yeah, you know, I feel like a zero
I've wasted such a lotta time too
Just to feel like a zero
I don't know if I should tell you how I'm feeling
Chances are you're laughing at me
And tell me that I don't know what I'm saying
It's not my fault, it's not my fault
It's not my fault, it's not my fault
