You're the only one in the world that you care about
Makes me wanna run and hide my head
It's hard for me to tell you how I feel
'Cause there's nothing real
Makes me wanna run and hide my head

And God only knows what'll keep me alive
Because everybody's turning 25 now
And I haven't got a word to say to you (You!)
Honor roll when I was 13
Head over heels when someone kissed me
When I needed someone you weren't there

I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry

Hey, hey, hey

You know that you scare me when you act this way
Makes me wanna run and hide my head
It's hard for me to tell if you're serious, or if you're joking
Makes me wanna run and hide my head

And God only knows what'll keep us from dying
Because every time I look around I see life as
A big lie, yeah (Yeah!)
Everybody's saying "Yeah, I'm the one", yeah
"Everybody come running to me"
But that's not how it works and it never did

I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry

You know that I'm sorry it had to be this way
Things got fucked up, but that's okay
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
You know that I'm sorry it had to be this way
Things got fucked up, but that's okay
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
