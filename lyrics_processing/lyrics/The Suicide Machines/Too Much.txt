Hey
Let's go!

Ah, when the extra weight hits my brain
I feel like I'm going insane
That's when the hand of God cuts my cord
That's when I feel like Jah the Lord

My heart is pumping blood into my head
And I feel just like a thousand pounds of lead
And the right half of my body has gone numb

I think it's too much (Too much!)
A little too much (Too much!)
I think it's too much for me

When the monster inside my head
Is telling me I'm better off dead
That's when my mind's turned upside down
That's when you wish you weren't around
See The Suicide Machines LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like
My head is telling me that it's not right
Your face is such an unfamiliar sight
And when I'm flying high as a fucking kite

I think it's too much (Too much!)
A little too much (Too much!)
I think it's too much for me

Take another drag to kill the pain
Of your meaningless existence in this godforsaken place
Where everyone's a sellout but they're also a fucking burnout
They thought it would be the best way to enhance your state of mind, Jay
Well, you see, I went home and I turned on the t.v. 'cause I had the time
I look at all this bullshit, all this muggin' and crime
War, death, disease, famine, what's it all worth?
I started to lose it by the time I started losin' my mind
So I got to the spliff, and I got to the J
Got to the Jah, and I got in the way
It's the same frame of mind (Frame of mind)
Got the same frame of mind (Frame of mind)
Got the same frame of mind (Frame of mind)
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
Fuck you!

When the extra weight hits my brain
I feel like I'm going insane
That's when the hand of God cuts my cord
That's when I feel like Jah the Lord

My heart is pumping blood into my head
And I feel just like a thousand pounds of lead
And the right half of my body has gone numb

I think it's too much (Too much!)
A little too much (Too much!)
