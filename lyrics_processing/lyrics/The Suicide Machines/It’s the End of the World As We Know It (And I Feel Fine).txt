With an earthquake
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane
Lenny Bruce is not afraid, let's go
Eye of a hurricane
Listen to yourself churn
World serves it's own needs
Dummy serve your own needs
Feed it off an aux speak
Grunt, no, strength
Ladder start to clatter
With fear fight down height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
A government for hire and a combat site
Left of west and coming in a hurry
With the furies breathing down your neck
Team by team reporters baffled
Trumped, tethered cropped
Look at that low playing, fine, then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common food
But it'll do save yourself, serve yourself
World serves it's own needs
Listen to your heart bleed
Dummy with the rapture
And the revered and the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam
Fight, bright light feeling pretty psyched
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine
Six o'clock, TV hour
Don't get caught in foreign towers
Slash and burn, return
Listen to yourself churn
Locking in, uniforming
Book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate
Automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive
Step down, step down
Watch your heel
Crush, crushed
Uh-oh, this means no fear cavalier
Renegade steer clear
A tournament, tournament
A tournament of lies
Offer me solutions
Offer me alternatives
And I decline
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine, and I feel fine, and I feel fine
The other night
I dreamt of knives
Continental drift divide
Mountains sit in a line
Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Brezhnev
Lenny Bruce and Lester
Bangs Birthday party
Cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic
Alarm book neck, right? Right
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
And I feel fine
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
