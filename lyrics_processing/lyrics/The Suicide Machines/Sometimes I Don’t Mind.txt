There's something there that lights a spark inside of me
And it makes me want to sing
Makes me forget everything
There's something there inside your eyes
Lets me know you'd never lie
You fill me up and I know what you need
Do you know what you mean to me?
Well I watch you sleep sometimes and it feels like the first time
And you're always on my mind
Everyday is like the first day
And I talk to you sometimes even though you never talk back
And I buy you things sometimes 'cause I don't mind
There's something strange, I can't get mad
Even when you're being bad - just look at me, and I forget everything
I try but I can't be mean
You sit by me and I scratch your back
You lick my hands then I get a rash, but that's okay
Because we, we are a team
You make a mess and then I clean
Well I watch you sleep sometimes and it feels like the first time
And you're always on my mind
Everyday is like the first day
And I talk to you sometimes even though you never talk back
And I buy you things sometimes 'cause I don't mind

Makes me laugh when you chase the cats
You chase 'em around
And when it's close to feeding time, you stare at me and whine
You won't lay down, you'll hardly sit
I give you a bath when you smell like shit
But you don't mind
And we go out every now and then
And when you're done then we come back in
Well I watch you sleep sometimes and it feels like the first time
And you're always on my mind
Everyday is like the first day
And I talk to you sometimes even though you never talk back
And I buy you things sometimes 'cause I don't mind
Yeah I don't mind
