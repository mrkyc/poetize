Got an overload of hate
Got a bad attitude
With no intent to change
I've had my fill
I put my cards on the table
Won't take it back
'Cause today I hate everything Buy
I hate it all, I hate my friends
I hate this song
I hate this bad attitude, I'm sure you hate me too
But I don't care, you know why
When it's over then you die
No making friends today
'Cause I hate everything
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate the trees
Hate the birds and the bees
Got a sick fucking mind
And no time for your kind
I'll say again, must I still question my friends
I'll smile tomorrow
'Cause today I hate everything

Got a monkey on my back
Got a lot of things to say
And I think I'm gonna crack
Can't buy a smile off the world's happiest man
No huggin' trees today
'Cause I hate everything
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
Fuck, I hate it all
I hate the winter, summer, spring, I hate the fall
I hate the world, the birds, the flowers and the squirrels
I said before that today I hate everything
I got an itch I can't scratch
All these people on my back
Make me sick, they're all pricks
And your mother turns tricks
Don't bother me either way
And I don't care what you say
Don't need a hug
'Cause today I hate everything
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
I hate everything, fuck you
