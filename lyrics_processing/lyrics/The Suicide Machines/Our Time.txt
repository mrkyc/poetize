I got no time!

I got no time!
How can it end when it never began?
Why can't I win when I know I can?
Seems that we've forgotten about the mess we're in
Which way do we go, and was there ever a plan?

Well, it seems I'm getting old, you see
And I can't avoid responsibility
Stuck in a box of popular belief
And it feels like something's wrong with me

I've got no, I've got no time! (I've got no time for myself)
I've got no, I've got no time! (I've got no time for myself)
I've got no, I've got no time! (I've got no time for myself)
I've got no, I've got no time! (I've got no time for myself)

Do we have a function?
Tell me, is there something?
Is this my assumption?
Tell me, is there something?
Life is nothing but consumption
Tell me, is there something there?
Oh yeah!

How can we help when we don't know where to begin?
Say you're fighting the system, yet you got sucked in
Say you dropped out of the race 'cause you never fit in
It's a racist power structure, do we call it human?

Well, it seems I'm getting old, you see
And I can't avoid responsibility
Stuck in a box of popular belief
And it feels like something's wrong with me

I've seen through all the years (And through all the tears)
I've seen my share, it makes me feel like no one even cares
I've seen through all the years (And through all the tears)
I've seen my share, it makes me feel like no one even cares

Do we have a function?
Tell me, is there something?
Is this my assumption?
Tell me, is there something?
Life is nothing but consumption
Tell me, is there something there?
There, there
