We got no time - We haven't got a monent
Oh yeah there's - gotta be something
A new revolution - A final solution
Oh a rich man in the white house
All gonna rise up to let you hear our voice
Bullied and paid your way there is no doubt
Who are they to take away a woman's choice
We've been livin so long under oppression all afflicted by their sick economic games
Power, policy, and religion money talks leaders listen
All over the world the story's the same
We gotta stand up - for what we believe in
We got no time - We haven't got a monent
Oh yeah there's - gotta be something
A new revolution - A final solution
Oh gotta change the world for our children
It'llbe them who inherit all of our mistakes
So can you please listen to what I'm sayin
Gotta change our self-destructive ignorant ways
Becuase our state of mind needs to be corrected
So let's teach our kinds never to hate
And its their future we're protectin
So black and white I'm beggin - Can we all get along together someday
