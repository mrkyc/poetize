Well, you're just like a club fag wearing Doc Martins
Get a pair of Chukkas or some checkerboard slip-ons
Worship Jeff Spicoli not Chris Cornell
Get a pair of Vans or God will send you to Hell (To Hell)
You think Doc Martins are the coolest invention
Since someone sliced a loaf of bread in someone else's kitchen
The plain truth is is that you just plain suck
So why should I tell you not to waste a hundred bucks?

Vans in my head and Vans on my feet
My sole is on the ground when I'm walking down the street (2, 3, 4!)
Don't need no Doctor Martins, can't wear no Birkenstocks
Just a crummy old pair of Chukka boots and a smelly old pair of socks

Well, if you wanna wear 'em, you don't have to ride a skateboard
You can even wear 'em with a pair of old cords
Someone'll probably tell you that they're not in trend
Just tell them that's the reason that you don't have any friends (Pick it up, pick it up)
No friends (No friends), no friends
No, I don't wanna hear about alternative footwear (Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up)
I don't wanna hear about your new hairdo (Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up)
See, I don't give a shit about you stupid motherfuckers (Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up)
'Cause I just wanna get a pair of olive green chuckas (Pick it up, pick it up)
