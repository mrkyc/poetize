'Cause he was slaving building cars
Blood and sweat upon the gears
All of his off time spent at the bar
Years and years of nothing but sorrow
I wonder how can he be content
Fucking just to wake up tomorrow
And do it all over again
Gonna wake up tomorrow and do it again
On the streets of Detroit
On the streets of this town
All their dreams are destroyed
Once you're in, you can never get out
See Reggie sleeps on Jefferson Avenue
On the courthouse heat exhausts
He's no different than me or you
In 1984 he got laid off
A motor city dead of 
We shared a joke and I gave him some change
Wonder is there a hope for his future
I don't know, I never saw him again
Don't think that I'll ever see him again

On the streets of this town
All their dreams are destroyed
Once you're in, you can never get out
Casinos, miles and miles of factories
Thousands of condemned homes
Every corner theres churches and liquor stores, all I need
Is a match and some gasoline
I'm gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
My father put in his best years, yeah
Working for one of the big three
I still remember my mother's tears
We're born to die in a factory
Coming home at dawn's early break
See he's strung out from the late night shift
Pills and powder to stay awake
I see his bottles are empty again
Prescription bottles are empty again
On the streets of Detroit
On the streets of this town
All their dreams are destroyed
Once you're in, you can never get out
On the streets of Detroit
On the streets of this town
All their dreams are destroyed
Once you're in, you can never get out
