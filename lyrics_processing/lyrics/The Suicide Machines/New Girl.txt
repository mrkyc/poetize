Yeah

Well I can't wait to tell you all about her, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
And I can't wait for you to hear me shout it, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
When we were together, you tried to break my heart
Said you always did your best at keeping us apart
Said now you're dead and gone and I've got a new thing going
I can't wait to see your face when you and your friends show up

So I've got a - I got a new girl
So I've got a - I got a new girl
So I've got a - I got a new girl
So I've got a - I got a new girl

Something makes you think that you're some kinda winner
Said you wanna get married and cook somebody dinner?
Said you're making fun of me 'cause I'm young and got no money
I've got no time for school books 'cause I got no time to study

Well I can't wait to tell you all about her, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)
And I can't wait for you to hear me shout it, all about my new girl
(He can't wait to tell you about his new girl)

That's the way it looks, and I'm really glad you think so
So concerned with friends and your popularity
That you never ever took the time to see the real me
