Drop it!
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, what went wrong?
Hey, I don't know why
Hey, I might as well try

Well, I looked around this crazy place and tried to make some sense of it
Robbed a bank and stole a car, and tried to put some dents in it
And everybody's playing games, I don't know what to make of it
Don't play your stupid games, you know I don't need all that fucked up shit

Well, no one ever told me I was gonna get older
I turned 21 and I thought my life was over
It took a long time to get where I am now
And I'm not gonna sit around wondering how, no

Well, I listen to your fuckin' shit, I can't make any sense of it
'Cause what goes in does not come out, you've gotta put two cents in it
You're just a blob of fucking jell, your brain is floating out in space
If your brain was worth a quarter, I'd get twenty-six cents back in change

Well, no one told me that the grass would be greener
I've done a lot of things since the last time that I seen her
No one ever told me it would be this way
That's why you can't make any sense out of anything I say

My world is crumbling and I don't know what to do
It's falling down around me 'cause I'm thinking of you
If we take a look, look at our world today
Are our morals on decline, or have we all gone insane?
Insane (Insane)
Insane (Insane)
Insane (Insane)
Pick it up!

Hey, what's going on?
Hey, what went wrong?
Hey, I don't know why
