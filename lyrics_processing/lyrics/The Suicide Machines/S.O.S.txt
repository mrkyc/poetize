I take a look around, I don't like what I see
A bunch of people who don't know shit about unity
I see right through your skin, you say you see through mine
Then please explain to me why we fight all the time

I can't take it anymore, this is bothering me
Got people killing each other, why does this have to be?
I wish I knew, I really wish I knew
How people see, there's no real difference between me and you

It's a bomb with a short fuse
And I know it seems like no use
The tension's building a reaction
This is a call to action!

S.O.S., we need help
S.O.S., we need help
S.O.S., we need help
S.O.S., we need help

Man's inhumanity towards another man
It's man's insanity and ignorance again
And now the time has come to stop what's going on
The hatred's building up, exploding like a bomb

And I know it seems like no use
The tension's building a reaction
This is a call to action!

B-b-b-bomb's gonna pop, b-b-b-bomb has gotta stop
B-b-b-bomb's gonna pop, b-b-b-bomb has gotta stop

B-b-b-bomb's gonna pop, b-b-b-bomb has gotta stop
It's a bomb, it's a bomb!

It's a bomb with a short fuse (And it's gonna pop)
And I know it seems like no use (But it's gotta stop)
The tension's building a reaction (We'll need to regress)
This is a call to action!
