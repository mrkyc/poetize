They got four grown kids and a wilted life
Guess that's the way it goes...yeah...yeah
Spent forty-seven years in a butcher shop
He spends his hundred dollar pension on his burial plot
Cause that's the way it goes...yeah...yeah
Sometimes he thinks back to the times he had
Before his kids moved away and his wife went mad
Now he feels used up like money spent
Like a wet tongue sucking on a peppermint
Can't you hear him crying out his soft lament
Take me down Where the Water's Deep
Down to the river where the water's sweet
My jug's bone dry from the desert heat
I need to fill it up again
Take me down Where the Water's Deep
Down to the river cause I need a drink
My jug's bone dry from the desert heat
I need to fill it up..fill it up again
There's a young girl looking for a brighter fate
Than pouring coffee for the truckers off the interstate
Cause that's the way it goes...yeah...yeah

With an adolescent husband for a drunken spouse
Cause that's the way it goes...yeah...yeah
Now her lips are cracked from the burning sun
And she wants to flee but her legs won't run
Sometimes she crys when the day is done
Take me down Where the Water's Deep
Down to the river where the water's sweet
My jug's bone dry from the desert heat
I need to fill it up again
Take me down Where the Water's Deep
Down to the river where the waters sweet
My jug's bone dry from the desert heat
I need to fill it up..fill it up again
Oh my bones are cracking and my blood's done turned to dust yeah....
Oh I could use a big drink now
Where The Waters Deep
Take me down Where the Water's Deep
Down to the river where the waters sweet
My jug's bone dry from the desert heat
I need to fill it up again
Take me down Where the Water's Deep
Down to the river where the waters sweet
My jug's bone dry from the desert heat
