Tiger lily, moved to the city
She just turned twenty-one
And then I said, "Here's my number, hit me up
If you're needing anyone"

And I could be anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone for you
Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
Be your light
Be your light (Yeah)

Well, I gave her love but it wasn't enough
So she called me up just to call it off
I can't afford to make that mistake this time
And if you're flying over the Serengeti
Tiger lily, don't forget me
The way I am, not the way I was, mmm
You might also like
And I could be anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone for you
Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
Be your light
Be your light (Light, light, light)

Anyone for you

I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
I could love you, I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby, let me be your light
Be your light (Woo)
Be your light (Woo)
Oh
