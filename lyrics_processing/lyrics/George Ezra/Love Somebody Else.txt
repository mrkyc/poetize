It's all for the taking
Happiness and warmth
It exists but not forever
Else you wouldn't see it coming and it's been a while
Else you wouldn't see it coming and it's been a while

Is there anybody out there in the silence?
Give me a sign, let me know that you're there
Can you hear me cryin'? Can you hear me givin' up, givin' up?
Givin' up, givin' up on myself

Love, love somebody else
'Cause I'm giving up on myself
Love, love somebody else
'Cause I'm giving up on myself

And I bought an old Mercedes
And drove it down the motorway
And on every inch of that old car, babe, I spray-painted your name
I took a lighter from my pocket
And I set it up in flames
And now I'm walking home and I'm all alone sad singin' in the rain

Is there anybody out there in the silence?
Give me a sign, let me know that you're there
Can you hear me cryin'? Can you hear me givin' up, givin' up?
Givin' up, givin' up on myself

Love, love somebody else
'Cause I'm giving up on myself
Love, love somebody else
'Cause I'm giving up on myself
Love somebody else
'Cause I'm giving up on myself, yeah
Love, love somebody else
'Cause I'm giving up on myself

I'm givin' up, givin' up, givin' up, givin' up on myself (Nothing's gonna last forever)
I'm givin' up, givin' up, givin' up, givin' up on myself (Nothing's gonna last forever)
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up, givin' up on myself (The good and the bad, nothing's gonna last forever)

The good and the bad
Nothing's gonna last forever
The good and the bad
Nothing's gonna last forever
The good and the bad
Nothing's gonna last forever
The good and the bad
