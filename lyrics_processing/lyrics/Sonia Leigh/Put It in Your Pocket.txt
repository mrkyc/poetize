Draggin my igloo behind my flip flop fleet
The water's just right everybody's jumpin in
It's a party when we're lounging on the bank side chilling
Got my whole crew together barbecuing by the river
Laid back, shades on, rolling up hay
Damn right it's a beautiful day
Kickin out summer jams
Gettin turnt up sitting on ten
Gonna let the speakers blow oh oh oh oh oh oh ooooh
Put it in your pocket
Big blue sky
Golden sun shining down heavenly light
Hey can I get it to go oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ooooh oh
Put it in your pocket
Oh oh oh oh ooooh oh
Ain't nobody worried bout a monday morning
Today's about right now
Living in the moment
Left my phone back at home
Ain't no drama calling me
Got my radio dialed in cranking that country
If I kicked the bucket right now I'd die happy
Laid back shades on, rolling up hay
Damn right it's a beautiful day
Kickin out summer jams
Gettin turnt up sitting on ten
Gonna let the speakers blow oh oh oh oh oh oh ooooh
Put it in your pocket
Big blue sky
Golden sun shining down heavenly light
Hey can I get it to go oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ooooh oh
Put it in your pocket
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ooooh oh
Put it in your pocket
Laid back shades on, rolling up hay
Damn right it's a beautiful day
Kickin out summer jams
Gettin turnt up sitting on ten
Gonna let the speakers blow let em blow, oh let em blow, oh let em blow, let em blow
Big blue sky
Golden sun shining down heavenly light
Hey can I get it to go oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ooooh oh
Put it in your pocket
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ooooh oh
Go on and put it in your pocket
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ooooh oh
