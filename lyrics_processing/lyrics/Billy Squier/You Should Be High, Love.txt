Some say love is borrowed time
A lonely loan only lovers find
It's got you down, said you're on the line
And I can read you like a book, say I can read your mind

You been holdin' back the hands of time
Heaven sakes, you know you should be flyin'

You should be high, love
You should be my love
You should be high, love
You should be my love

You've been left to your own devices
Hand out, tongue out, compromises
You're the first to go but the last in line
And if you lose your love, you can lose your mind

You been runnin' out of borrowed time
Heaven sakes you know you should be flyin'

You should be high, love
You should be my love

You should be my love (If shadows should find you)
You should be high, love
You should be my love (Put 'em behind you)
You should be high, love
You should be my love
You should be high, love
You should be my love
You should be high, love
You should be my love
Ooh yeah

It's all behind you
Let the spirit find you
And the love light blind you
Say, yeah, yeah

You should be high, love
You should be my love (Ow)
You should be high, love
You should be my love (If shadows should find you)
You should be high, love
You should be my love (Put 'em behind you)

You should be high, love
You should be my love
You should be high, love
You should be my, my, my, my
