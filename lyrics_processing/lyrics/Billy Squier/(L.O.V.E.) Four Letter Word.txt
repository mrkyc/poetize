V-E- she's not comin' back to me
L-O I can't let go
V-E- tell ya what that girl don't mean to me
So you see my friend, love is just a four letter word
Once there were schoolyards with children at play
Once there was England, and one sunny day
One kinda woman for one kinda man
How could I know I was not in her plans
Say love, say love
When I was soarin' you urged me to fly
When I was hungry you fed me your lines
Led me to water, you sang me your song
One day when I woke up I found you were gone
Say love, say love
Say love, say love
Nobody told me, love is just a four letter word
L is for losin' the love that you crave
And O is when it's over and your heart can't explain
V is for the victim, the victim of the crime and
E is every morning when you break down on time
So you see my friend, love is just a four letter word
You might also likeL-O- I can't let go
V-E- friends all say just let it be
L-O- oo-oo
V-E-
Forget your illusions, forget what they say
'Cause all your dreams of happiness have just blown away
Once in a lifetime your spirit will fly
That's what she told me 'fore she told me goodbye
Love, say love
Love, say love
So you see my friend, love is just a four letter word
L is for losers when fortune turns blue
And O is overcomin' what you know to be true
V is for the vengeance that's left out in the rain and
E is each and every night you crumble in pain
So you see my friend, love is just a four letter word
So you see my friend
I say "Stop, don't say it"
So you see my friend, love is just a four letter word
L-O- whaddo I know
V-E- she's not comin' back to me
L-O- I can't let go
V-E- tell ya what that girl don't mean to me
