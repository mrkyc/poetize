But now I know my connection is comin' through
I put my ass on the line when you walk by...
Hey--so what's new
Don't look now she's inchin' up behind
Don't look now in the creases of your mind
Don't stop now...we're movin' much too fast
Gonna find out where you draw the line
Here she come now...she tunes so fine
There's a lady with a tenor sax
Cool baby drives a mean Cadillac
Lady with a tenor sax
You gotta meet her on her own level--don't look back
Don't look back...don't look back
Cause she's right behind you with a tenor sax
She jives, she's so bad
She's a tango with a big, big business sense
She wind you up--but could I know her better...
But if you wanna buy--get off the fence
Don't walk now...you'll slip into the past
Don't walk now...can nothin' ever last
Don't look now...the chips are gonna fall
Sooner of later you're gonna be mine
Here she come now, oh yeah yeah

She's a lady with a tenor sax
When you find what you're after there'll be no turnin' back
Lady with a tenor sax
They say she know why--I think she know, think she know, yea
Don't walk now...you'll slip into the past
Don't walk now...can nothin' ever last
Don't look now...the chips are gonna fall
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Here she come now, oh yeah yeah
She's a lady with a tenor sax
In a room full of precedent she's leader of the pack
Lady with a tenor sax
She know why...she know why...she know
She's a lady with a tenor sax
Soul baby cuts a groove on her back
