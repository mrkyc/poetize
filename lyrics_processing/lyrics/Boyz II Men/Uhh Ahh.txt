Uh (Uh), ah (Ah)
Uh, ah (I understand what you feel)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah
(Mike?) Yes?

The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see
Why can't we go all the way to the top?
The fullest extreme
The sounds I hear when you're with me
Express the way that you feel, girl (As you say)

Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Oh, that's it)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Oh, don't stop)
(Oh)

In a passionate sense, we move in close
The love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name
Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide

Uh, ah
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Yeah)
Uh, ah (Uh, uh, oh)
Uh, ah (Uh, uh)
Uh, ah (Oh-oh)
Uh, ah (Uh, hey)
Uh, ah
(Ooh)

The music is low, the lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows with every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust, and a lot of love
Sweet caresses, yes, it's good to be as you rub
And clench my back, ecstasy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck and stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight, I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that booty
Uh, ah (Ooh, ah)
Uh, ah (Give it to me, baby, I'll rub your back)
Uh, ah (As you lay here with me, yeah)
Uh, ah (Oh)
Uh, ah (I want you and I need you)
Uh, ah (Hold on to me, yeah)
Uh, ah (Oh)
Uh, ah (Right now, baby)
Uh, ah (Oh, oh)
Uh, ah (Don't go away, please baby, stay with me)
Uh, ah (Oh, I can do it to you)
