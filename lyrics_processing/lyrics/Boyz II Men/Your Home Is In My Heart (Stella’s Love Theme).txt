Whoa, whoa
Whoa
Don't be afraid
Now there's no hitch
Even from across the sea (so far across the sea)
I can hear you callin' me (baby, come to me)
Destiny controls the air (no matter where you are)
Dream and dare to love again (your home is in my heart)
I know the way I feel 'bout you will last
Oh, yes, it's gonna last and stand the test of time
So your search for love is about to end
Your future holds a place where true love begins
Even from across the sea (so far across the sea)
I can hear you callin' me (baby, come to me)
Destiny controls the air (no matter where you are)
Dream and dare to love again (your home is in my heart)
Take a romantic journey, just start a new beginning
You won't no where you're goin' till you're there
Is it just physical or is it lasting love
Please don't give up, we won't know unless we try
