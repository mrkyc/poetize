Baby, let me tell you about how I feel
This urge is seizing me, controlling it's unreal
Ooh, ah baby, I wanna let you know
You got me yearning, so baby, let me show you

Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me (Right here and nowhere else)
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know

Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need

Pardon my expression (You're excused)
But the feeling I have is so strong
I guess you know this isn't easy to do
I keep trying and trying to give my love to you

Ooh, I want you baby, gotta let you know I need ya here with me
This ain't the right way, gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know
