Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe

Coolin' in the studio you know how the story goes
Bobbin' our heads to the tune we're about to do
It's a laid-back swing thang
The groove we feel is strong
We need peace here to get it on
Having fun as we go, makin' sure the flavor shows

Cause we're feeling alright
Takin' our time to free our minds and have a ball, y'all
Everything's fine it ain't nothing to it cause
We're gonna do it all, what are we doin'

We're just vibin' dancing the night away
Groovin', vibin', non-stop until the break of day

Ooh yeah yeah, in a dark room with a brew like
In the basement music just right
Nothing goin' down but the mellow sounds
Of Mr. DJ's turntables goin' round
A mad sensation, a crew of women around sparks inspiration
To set something off the right way to hear the people say
See Boyz II Men LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also like
That we're feelin' alright
Takin' our time to free our minds and have a ball y'all
Everything's fine it ain't nothing to it
'Cause we're gonna do it all, don't you know that

We're just vibin' dancing the night away
Groovin', vibin', don't stop until the break of day
We're just vibin' dancing the night away
Groovin', vibin', don't stop until the break of day

Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Put your mind at ease just catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Don't press yourself just catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Put your mind at ease just catch the vibe
Just take a minute and catch the vibe
Don't press yourself just catch the vibe

We're just vibin' dancing the night away
Groovin', vibin', don't stop until the break of day
Just take a minute and (We're just vibin')
Put your mind at ease and (We're just vibin')
