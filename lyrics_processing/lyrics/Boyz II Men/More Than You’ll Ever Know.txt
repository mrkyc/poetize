More than you'll ever know

I know a lot of years have passed us
But I still love you more than you'll ever know
There was a time I felt it wouldn't last us
And baby, how I felt, I didn't show
Sometimes I took you for granted
And thought that you would understand it
But through it all we managed to make it through tough times

No, no, I can't imagine not having you by my side
Everything you are and all you do
I'm still in love with you

More than you'll ever know
Just like the stars in a thousand skies
More than you'll ever know (Ever know)
Deeper than a place where the ocean floor lies
You're still number one in my eyes
And to this day I still get butterflies
Know that I love you more than you will ever know

Sometimes I watch you sleeping
Kiss you and fall in love all over again
In the morning when you're leaving
I start to miss my best friend
You're my better half, like a twin
You complete my words when I begin
We don't have to be validated
With love we'll always make it

No, I can't imagine not having you by my side
(You by my side)
Everything you are and all you do
I'm still in love with you

More than you'll ever know
Just like the stars in a thousand skies
More than you'll ever know (Ever know)
Deeper than a place where the ocean floor lies
You're still number one in my eyes
And to this day I still get butterflies (Ooh wee)
Know that I love you more than you will ever know

See, I don't never wanna be without you
To me, you're one of a kind
(To me, you're one of a kind)
You're my everything (Everything)
Girl, you're my-my-my-my-my sunshine, oh
Know you stood with me
Behind me through tough times
I'm so glad that you are mine
Knowing you're my ride or die
I love you
More than you'll ever know
Just like the stars in a thousand skies
(Stars in a thousand skies)
More than you'll ever know
Deeper than a place where the ocean floor lies
You're still number one in my eyes
(Still number one in my eyes)
And to this day I still get butterflies (Butterflies)
Know that I love you more than you will ever know
More than you'll ever know
Just like the stars in a thousand skies
More than you'll ever know
Deeper than a place where the ocean floor lies
You're still number one in my eyes
(Still number one in my eyes)
And to this day I still get butterflies (Butterflies)
(Girl, I get butterflies)
