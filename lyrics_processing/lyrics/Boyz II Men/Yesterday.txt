Yesterday (Yesterday)
All my troubles seem so far away
Now it seems as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know
She wouldn't say
(She wouldn't say, she wouldn't say)
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday

Yesterday (Yesterday)
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know
She would not say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play

Oh I believe in yesterday
I believe in yesterday
Was so far away
Oh yesterday was far away
And I know I can't turn back
