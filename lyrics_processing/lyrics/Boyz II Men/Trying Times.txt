Baby, I'm so glad you're here
'Cause I have so many things to tell you
So many things to talk to you about
'Cause you are the strength that I hold on to
And I hope that I am the strength that you hold on to
So we can strive together and be perfect
'Til death do us part

The night is gone, the morning's here
And soon it's time to talk about
Where we stand and where we plan to be
Our life-long years, I need to know
I keep crying tears of joy
I guess that's what you're put here for
To change these tears of pain to tears of happiness

In my trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you

Trials and tribulations
Build up walls in front of faces
Made of stone
Yet we stand strong enough
To break the walls down to journey on
But I know if we just bond our hearts
There will be nothing that will stand in our way
And we'll be together forever and a day
