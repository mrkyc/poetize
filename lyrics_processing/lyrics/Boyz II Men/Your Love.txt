Woo, woo
Your, your, your, your love

Oh, it's gettin' hot in here (It's gettin' too hot in here)
So turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down low)
And let your smooth body take control (Let your smooth body take control)
You know what I need sweetie
Take this time and you will succeed
In loving me the way I like it
Your love

Your love is too hot
I can feel your love running through my mind
Nobody loves me, you're a one of a kind
Your love
Your love is too hot
Your love

Stop right here, baby (Stop)
I can't take it anymore
It's just the way you move
And the way your kisses groove
Love is on the rise
And caress me with surprises
Of your love, love
