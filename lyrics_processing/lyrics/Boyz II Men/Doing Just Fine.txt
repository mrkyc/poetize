There was a time when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe...
I'd sit in my room, because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry, cry...

Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Coz it may seem hard to believe

But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind...(Ooooh oooh )

You were my earth, my number one priority
Gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me I would do, hoo...( Oooh ooh oooh ooh )
Somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather and told
Me that you had to journey on...
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone, long gone...

Now you say you never meant to play your games
But girl don't you know it's far too late(ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Because you let our love just fall apart(Fall apart)
You no longer have my heart...(You don't have a heart)
And I...(ah ah ah)

But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine(ah ah ah ah ah)
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind...
I don't need you anymore...

When you said goodbye, I felt so all alone
There were times at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much too weak to make it on my own
But baby after all the misery and pain you put me through
So unfair to me girl, you're no longer my world
And I ain't missin' you... ( at all)

But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger(Time made me stronger)
You're no longer on my mind...(You're no longer on my mind)
Oh oh oh
See baby when you walked away (you are just fine)
You didn't think that it would end up this way
But I knew you'd be coming 'round someday
Just as sure as my name is Wanya (ooh ooh ooh)

But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger(Time made me stronger)
You're no longer on my mind...(You're no longer on my mind)
Oh oh oh You are no longer on my mind
Ooooh oooh yeah oooh ooh
But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
