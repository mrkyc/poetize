I've been feeling this emptiness for some time
Tryna make do
But my world has been so crazy
Living without you
Now I'm a man and not ashamed to admit my faults
Now that I know
But the only thing that matters now
Is I shoulda never let you go

So every night before I go to sleep
I pray
That the Lord would one day somehow
Send you back my way

Baby, I miss you (oh yes I do)
I need to be back in your arms
I never stop loving you (oh yeah)
My heart is where you belong
Baby, I miss you (baby i)
Before heaven and earth pass away
Lord, please show me what to do
Tell me what to say
'Cause we've come too far to let it slip away
Whoa-oh-whoa
'Cause we've come too far to let it slip away

Couldn't understand many things in my life
How much you meant to me
Now I'm prepared to be everything
That a man is supposed to be
Mmm... I don't wanna be alone no more
Know that my heart can't take it
Not a day has passed
Since you've been gone
That I thought that I could make it
Ah baby

So every night before I go to sleep
I pray
That the Lord would one day somehow
Bring you back my way

Baby, I miss you
I need to be back in your arms
(bring it back to me, baby)
I'll never stop loving you
My heart is where you belong
Baby, I miss you
Before heaven and earth pass away
Lord, please show me what to do
Tell me what to say
'Cause we've come too far to let it slip away
Oh, baby
Don't know that else to say or do
It's hard to get through every night and every day
Knowing I let you walk away
It's killing me inside
Feelings so strong I can't hide
So Lord
Help me get through these trying times
I'll do anything to have you back in my life

Baby, I miss you
I need to be back in your arms
I'll never stop loving you
(Never stop loving you, no)
My heart is where you belong
(Where you belong)
Baby, I miss you (Baby, I miss you)
Before heaven and earth pass away
Lord, please show me what to do
Tell me what to say
'Cause we've come too far to let it...
Baby, I miss you
I need to be back in your arms
I'll never stop loving you
My heart is where you belong
Baby, I miss you
Before heaven and earth pass away
Lord, please show me what to do
Tell me what to say
'Cause we've come too far to let it...
