I was lonely
I needed someone to see me through
And I was at the end of my rope
I needed someone to cut me lose

And then an angel, out of the blue
Gave me the sense that I might make it through
And somehow I survived, with no rhyme or reason
And now I know I'll make it
Through the miracle of you

I know the color of love
And it lives inside of you
I know the color of truth
(It's in the image of you)
If it comes from the heart
Then you know that it's true
It will color your soul, like a rainbow
(Like a rainbow)
And the color of love is in you

Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
The colors of love, love, love, love

Like a bridge
Over troubled, troubled water
You stood beside me, stood beside me
And your love did not falter

And then the angel, the angel in you
Gave me the strength to know that I will get through
And that's how I survived
Ain't no other reason
And now I know I'll make it
Through the miracle of you

I know the color of love
And it lives inside of you
I know the color of truth
(It's in the image of you)
If it comes from the heart
Then you know that it's true
It will color your soul, like a rainbow
(Like a rainbow)
And the color of love is in you
(Is in you)
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
(It's the colors)
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
The colors of love, love, love, love
(Oh, oh)

So girl I wanna thank you
I can't thank you enough
For showing me the meaning
The meaning of true love
When I was lost and so in need, you opened up your heart
When I needed you to comfort me, you opened up your arms
I couldn't face another day
You said, "Don't be afraid"
You showed my heart the way
Showed me the way

I know the color of love
And it lives inside of you
(It lives in you)
I know the color of truth
(It's in the image of you)
If it comes from the heart
(Comes from the heart)
Then you know that it's true
It will color your soul, like a rainbow
(Like a rainbow)
And the color of love is in you
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
(It's the colors)
Colors, the colors, the colors, the colors of...
The colors of love, love, love, love
