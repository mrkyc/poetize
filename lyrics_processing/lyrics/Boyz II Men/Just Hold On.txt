I know you've been goin' through some things
The pain you hold inside is written on your face
I know you're 'bout tired of the rain
Well baby so am I but I know things can change
Well you can die, you can sigh, you can cry
'Til you're midnight blue
But that's not you, no no
'Cause I know you're stronger and...
It's apparent to me
So do you

If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous (I know)
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way, my love
If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous (I know)
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way

I know it's been heavy on your mind
Baby give him up he's not worth your time
Where is it that says you need a guy
Well you don't need his love to justify your life
So he can go, let him go, make him go
You should want him to
So can you?
I know that you're stronger
It's getting clearer to me
So do you?
