Oh, hey
Yeah

I've been wanderin' 'round in the dark
Been lost somewhere
Where no light could shine on my heart
I have known a pain so deep
But I know my faith will free me

(Get there) And I'll get through this
(Get there) I'll find my way again
So don't tell me that it's over
'Cause each step just gets me closer
I will get there

(I will get there) I will get there
I will get there somehow
(Cross that river) Cross that river
Nothing's stoppin' me now
I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there (get there)
Get there (get there)

I've been in these chains for so long
I'll break free and I'll be there where I belong
Hold my head up high, I'll stand tall
And I swear this time I won't fall

(Get there) I will do this
(Get there) No matter what it takes
'Cause I know no limitations
And I'll reach my destination, I will get there

(I will get there) I will get there
(I will get there somehow) somehow
(Cross that river) Cross that river
Nothing's stoppin' me now
I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there (get there)
Get there (get there)

Well, the night is cold and dark
But somewhere the sun is shining
And I'll feel it shine on me
I'll keep trying
I'll keep trying
(Oh whoa, I will get there) I will get there
I will get there somehow (somehow)
(Cross that river) I'll cross that river for you
Nothing's stoppin' me now
I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there (get there)
Ooh, get there (get there)

(I will get there) I will get there
(I will get there somehow) somehow
(Cross that river) I'll cross it for you
(Nothing's stoppin' me now) no matter what
(I will get through the night) I'll get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there (get there)
Ooh, get there (get there)
(Get there, get there)
