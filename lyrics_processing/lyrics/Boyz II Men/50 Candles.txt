It's gettin' kinda dark already
Should I light 'em?

Hey baby I'm ready, I'm oh so ready
I wanna make love to you, hey
Take 'em off, throw 'em down
Come here and let me feel what's in front of me
The outside world is of no concern
Just let our bodies and the candles in our room burn
With a feverish passion uncontained

Feels like one of those nights
Lady, I'm in need of love in a hurry
50 candles burn bright
And all is alright, as our bodies unite
Take our time, do it right

Give me your hand touch me right here
Oh so good want it more and more
Each moment your fingers linger all around
As I kiss you in the place
Where your composure comes undone
And your mind runs
We'll make love 'til the sun completely rises
Come play with me
Let me be the toy
That fulfills your needs
'Cause I'm yours tonight and you're all mine, baby
Roll with me
Don't be afraid let the feeling take you away
To a world of ecstasy
Where all you got to do is be free
And give your all and all

Feels like one of those nights
Lady, I'm in need of love in, in a hurry
50 candles burn bright
And all is right, as our bodies unite
Take your time, do it right baby

Come and get this
Waited all my life for your touch and your soft kiss
And life will never be the same, while ya moan and groan
I hear your voice call my name
Holding your body like a plastic molding
Your soul I'll be controlling
As the candles burn, we toss and we turn
From night to day, all our pleasures we learn
Come and play with me, play with me
Tonight's our night baby
50 candles burn bright
Come and roll with me, roll with me
Make love to me
Hold on tight
It's going to be a bumpy ride

Feels like one of those nights
Lady, I'm in need of love in a hurry
50 candles burn bright
And all is right, as our bodies unite
