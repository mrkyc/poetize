Mike...
Yeah, baby
It's over
How can you say that?
I'm sorry, that love is gone
No, please don't leave me
Don't feel bad
How can I not feel bad? I love you
But, it's better this way
No, I don't believe this
No, baby

I never thought that it could be
You would turn and do this to me
I can't let the love that we had here between us merely fade away
You told me you'd never go away
And for me, you'd always be here
Now you tell me that something's wrong and you must move on

A lonely heart is what I'll be
If no one cares for me
Let me show you now
The way that it would be if you were with me
Now I can feel the love we share
When you say it's not there
Deep inside I know that you still care
But I need you to show me now

I'm lookin' for a quiet place where love is free
And the dreams we shared last eternally
I feel now that it's the time
So won't you please come over here?
The closer and the closer I get to you
Keeps me warm to know that you'll stay around
So please keep your promise to me and don't go

A lonely heart is what I'll be
If no one cares for me
Let me show you now
The way that it would be if you were with me
Now I can feel the love we share
When you say it's not there
Deep inside I know that you still care
But I need you to show me now
If no one cares for me

Let me show you now
The way that it would be if you were with me
Now I can feel the love we share (I can feel, I can feel)
When you say it's not there
Deep inside I know that you still care (Deep inside, deep inside)
But I need you to show me now
(If no one cares for me)
