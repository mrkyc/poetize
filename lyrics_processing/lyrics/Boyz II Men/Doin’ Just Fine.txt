There was a time, when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe
Would sit in my room because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry
Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Cause it may seem hard to believe, but I

I'm doin' just fine, getting along very well
Without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
But I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind

You were my earth, my number one priority
I gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me, I would do
But somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather and told
Me that you had to journey on
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone, all gone
Now you say you never meant to play your games
But girl don't you know it's far too late
Because you let our love just fall apart
You no longer have my heart

I'm doin' just fine
Getting along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
But I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
I don't need you anymore

When you said goodbye, I felt so all alone
There were times at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much too weak to make it on my own
Baby after all the misery and pain you put me through
So unfair to me girl, you're no longer my world
And I ain't missin' you at all

I'm fine, (I'm doin' just fine baby)
Getting along very well
Without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
I'm fine (Said I'm doin' just fine)
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
See, baby when you walked away
(I'm doing just fine)
You didn't think it would end up this way
(Getting along very well without you in my life)
But I knew you'd be coming 'round someday
(I don't need you in my life)
Just as sure as my name is Wanya
Said I'm, I'm doin' just fine
