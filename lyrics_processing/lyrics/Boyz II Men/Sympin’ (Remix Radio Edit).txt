Oh, yeah

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Baby, let me tell you how I feel
This urge is seizing me, controlling, it's unreal
Ooh, ah, baby, I wanna let you know
You got me yearning, so baby, let me show you

Ooh, I want you, baby
Gotta let you know I need you here with me (Alright, right here and nowhere else, honey)
This ain't the right way
Gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know

Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, you know you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need

I guess you know this isn't easy to do
I keep trying and trying to give my love to you

Ooh, I want you, baby
Gotta let you know I need you here with me (Right here, right here, oh)
This ain't the right way
Gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue 'cause you know

Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, you know you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, you know you gotta be willing
To cry and beg and plead when you need

I'm always on my knees and, baby, baby, please
And the teasin' has to stop
Sweat on sweat, I made a little side bet
That if I knocks the boots, you'll be limpin'
Sympin' and sympin', never ever again
