Dear God, it's me again
I am so far from where I could have been
Dear God, I would be incomplete
But you came and touched my life in time of need
So I'm thanking you for all you've done
And for sacrificing your only son

That's why I'm writing you this letter
To let you know that I love you
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend
Lord, my love for you never ends

Dear God, oh, it's Shawn this time
I'm so grateful for the way you change my life
I'd give all I had, I'd just throw it all away
For a chance to walk with you through Heaven's gates
That's why I'm thanking you for your love and your grace
I don't deserve these blessings, no, no, that you give to me

That's why I'm writing you this letter
To let you know that I love you
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend
Lord, my love for you'll never end

Dear God, as a humble man I come to you
Like a child, needing your knowledge
Your love and your guidance
Thank you for trusting me with my own life's decisions, God
But I'm just a man
And I don't deserve this incredible life that you've given me, Jesus

Dear God, it's me Wanya
I'm so sorry, so sorry for living for me
But I promise from this day on, I'm living for you
'Cause without you, my life means nothing

That's why I'm writing you this letter
To let you know that I love you
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend
Lord, my love for you never ends

That's why I'm writing you this letter
To let you know that I love you
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend
