In this world today
Love is scarce and far away
And your heart gets so afraid to trust someone
All the times he let you down
There was no love to be found
Well it's not the end
There'll be time to mend
And you'll love again

Never, never let a broken heart
Take a chance for love away
Don't never let it make you fall apart
Never, never ever let the pain
Take your need for love away
Never, no never

And I know it seems hard
Open up let down your guards
But you owe it to your heart
To try again
Oh comes the time
When we must change
What the past has thrown away
Don't take the blame
Don't be ashamed
Throw your fears away
