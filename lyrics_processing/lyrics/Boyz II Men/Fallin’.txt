Every time I think of you
The woman all my life been waiting
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than love you endlessly
Don't know what you see in me
Girl you bring out the best in me
And I realize when I look in your eyes
There's nothing that I can do

Catch me I'm fallin'
Head over heels in love with you
Hopelessly fallin'
And no one can do
Catch me I'm fallin'
And my heart is like brand new
I'm falling in love, falling in love
With you

Every time I see your face
Its like sunshine on a cloudy day
It's a feeling that can't be replaced
Like the feeling when we embrace
Out of everything that you do to me
For your love I'll do almost everything
And I realize when I look in your eyes
There's nothing that I cannot do

Catch me I'm fallin'
Head over heels in love with you
Hopelessly fallin'
And no one can do
Catch me I'm fallin'
And my heart is like brand new
I'm falling in love, falling in love
With you

Now tell me how much you love me
And show me how much you need
I'm waiting right here for you
Whenever you need

I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' in love with you
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' in love with you
