He didn't tell no one. He just left one day
Folks said he was actin' like a fool
But he said, "I was about to go crazy and I was already foolish anyway
And what did I have to lose? What did I have to lose?"
He took off to Wisconsin late that night
Wisconsin, where he figured he could blend in
He said nothing felt good under him- not the road
Not the tuition money in his pocket
Not really even the car he was driving in
And what did he have to lose? What did he have to lose?
He said
CHORUS
At least I got a car I can drive tonight
I know it ain't much but it makes me feel alright
And alright ain't good, but alright's alright
At least I got a car I can drive tonight
Oh, college was hard for me and my friends
We all felt like little kids but they said we couldn't act that way
I knew I was supposed to change
But changing's hard and it was easier just to play video games
What did we have to lose? What did we have to lose?
We said
You might also likeMan, sometimes don't you want to just sit still?
OCause you can only run so fast or drive so far
And home might feel like a funny idea that you never understood
But you want it more than you want the car
BRIDGE
Cause you're tired of how the seats feel
And you're tired of the steering wheel
And you'd buy a new car but
The last thing you want is something new
Last thing you want is something new
Going home feels like the thing you ought to do
Cause You can only drive so far
CHORUS
Man I wish I had a home tonight
Somewhere I could feel more than alright
And alright ain't bad, but alright's just alright
And, man, I wish I had a home tonight
