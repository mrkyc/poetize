Daddy drove a bobcat momma poured coffee
At the cast iron skillet that shared the same lot as the amoco
And I remember me and my brother busting out the screened door
Like a couple wild Indians ten speeds for horses were fast as we could go

And I ain't ashamed how I was raised
Couldn't wipe the dirt and dust and smile off my face
I still got the scars
From growing up hard
There ain't a bare foot summer gone by that I'd ever change
Bout this old boy and the way we lived
God bless the rebel kids

We wore Walmart rubber boots out in the rain
Shootin' empty coke cans at a cool water creek
With a ten pump pellet gun
We were zebco reelin', marlboro steelin'
Outta daddy's new pack
Just to get the back of his callused hand
Oh I can still feel it man

And I ain't ashamed how I was raised
Couldn't wipe the dirt and dust and smile off my face
I still got the scars
From growing up hard
There ain't a bare foot summer gone by that I'd ever change
Bout this old boy and the way we lived
God bless the rebel kids

You don't realize til you look back
There wasn't money in the bank
And mom and dad were just doin'
The best they could

And I ain't ashamed how I was raised
Couldn't wipe the dirt and dust and smile off my face
I still got the scars
From growing up hard
There ain't a bare foot summer gone by that I'd ever change
Bout this old boy and the way we lived
God bless the rebel kids
Yea, God bless the rebel kids
