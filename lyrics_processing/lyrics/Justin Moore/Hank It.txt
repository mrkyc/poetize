A lot of things a country boy learns in life
How to shoot a gun and how to use a knife
But, when I pulled into Hershey, PA
I took my guitar up on the big stage
That night I did the best I could
Me and the boys played pretty darn good
Then I took myself out, sat in the crowd
And learned how Bocephus shakes 'em down

You gotta Hank it
You can't sip whiskey, gotta drink it
Push it up to ten and crank it
If you wanna keep your woman, gotta spank it
If you ain't got a bunch, you gotta bank it
Live it just like he sings it
You gotta Hank it

There was a smoking little blonde sitting next to me
Said how'd you make it here from Tennessee
She must have been late and didn't catch my show
But when you play at 7 that's the way it goes
So I tipped my hat and we sang along to
Where Have All My Rowdy Friends Gone
I climbed up on the bus after the show
Had a shot of Jim Beam and we hit the road
