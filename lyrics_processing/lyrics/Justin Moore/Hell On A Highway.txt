She's probably somewhere between Tennessee and Oklahoma by now
She took off with my heart, in the dark, out of this rear-view town
Brakes ain't an option when it comes to stopping, she won't
First time saying I'm sorry worked, but this time it don't

She's got them high heels pressed down hard, like she hates that floorboard
Leaving her red-tipped, still lit, lipstick cigarette trail behind taillights
Gone as it gets with her wings on the wind, angel made her getaway
Now she's out there puttin' my heart through hell on the highway

If I know her at all she's got the radio rockin the boss
She's all about born to run when she's pissed off, and she's pissed off
She probably called up her mamma and her mamma said it's about time
She said I ain't worth a dime and damn if she ain't right

She's got them high heels pressed down hard, like she hates that floorboard
Leaving her red-tipped, still lit, lipstick cigarette trail behind taillights
Gone as it gets with her wings on the wind, angel made her getaway
Now she's out there puttin' my heart through hell on the highway
Woah, she's wrecking the concrete, like she wrecks me
Woah, I'm in the dust

Yes she is
Yeah there on the highway
Yeah, aw yeah, yeah
She's got them high heels pressed down hard
I see taillights fadin' in the dark
Yeah, she's out there
