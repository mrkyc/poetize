Talk to your girl, dog
She down for you
You just got to make sure you down for her
They're way stronger than we are

We was doin from day one a feeling that i couldn't escape from
Seems like a dream I don't wanna awake from
A lot of things that I can't get away from
A lot of stress I just wanna erase 'em
You're the reason why I'm hard at work
You think my job is chasing baller skirts
I ain't got to search baby doll, you're first
See you got this touch that revolve to earth
I know you sweat when I'm out on tour
I was IMX and mature before
A lot of broads to step from my hotel door
Couldn't even recall what I go there for
But I was much younger much dumber
Out of touch, so I bring my lust on the summer
Crazy amazingly, you forgave me
Turned around and say to me

Whenever you need me, babe
Just call my name
No matter whatever you done you know that I'll be there
I'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through
Whenever you need me babe you know that I'll be there
See Nick Cannon LiveGet tickets as low as $150You might also like
Yo, every man needs a rider beside him
A Rodham to his Clinton to pick him up off the bottom
Whatever he need she got 'em and vise versa
Even though his style might hurt her
A phone call is a phone call to a fella
But to women it falls under the same umbrella
It's trust plus honesty respect
Gotta juggle 'em all, try not to neglect
'Cause if something go wrong it be hard to correct
They forgive but never forget
No matter how many diamonds you sit on they neck
And that invisible set should be invisible next
That's why I hold my home team down
No matter how much of this world I'm going around
I'm gonna treat you the right way
It always feel good when you say

Whenever you need me, babe
Just call my name
No matter whatever you done you know that I'll be there
I'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through
Whenever you need me babe you know that I'll be there
Now as soon as the media get a hold of the vocal
They gonna try to figure the motive, the reason I wrote it
Who the girl on my arm at the movie premiere?
Who the one in the drop with the wind in their hair?
Paparazzi watch me to see pops
Don't like me and that's wherever I might be
So I need a girl to withstand and understand
And stand next to Cannon 'cause I got a plan and
I ain't tryin put no weight on ya, girl
But it's hard to have a love affair in front of the world
Every time you move every step you make
Being watched and possibly videotaped
That's why I need a place I can escape
From and another soul in which my soul can relate
And I probably make a lot of mistakes
But I still need to hear somebody say

Whenever you need me, babe
Just call my name
No matter whatever you done you know that I'll be there
I'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through
Whenever you need me babe you know that I'll be there
Whenever you need me, babe
Just call my name
No matter whatever you done you know that I'll be there
I'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through
Whenever you need me babe you know that I'll be there
Whenever you need me, babe
Just call my name
No matter whatever you done you know that I'll be there
I'm down for you
Whatever you're goin through
