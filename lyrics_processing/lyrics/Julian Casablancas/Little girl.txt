A trick that people use to make you think they are smart
Is confidence when actually they're lost in the dark
Only someone with the mind of a child says he'll grow up
The seven and the avalanche you're life will show up
Its nice to be loved it can never happen too late
I wanna share my food but you have stolen my plate
Hey now, hey now go your way now

You tortured little girl
Showing them what love is all about
Where did all the time go?
Everywhere it's gone, gone, gone

You get the point now
You pick yourself up off the bars
She's on his arm now
Cause they remind you off the pictures on the wall now
But you was young and I wasn't not even born yet
If you think I know a little more bit
Than the average person on the streets you are incorrect
Because I'm ignorant as shit, not here to preach, man
You know I just wanna have fun, go to the beach, man
That's all I am, I'm just a simple guy who talks when
You put a microphone in front of him
You might also like
You twisted little girl
Showing them what life is all about
Where did all the time go?
Everywhere it's gone

Running left in a relationship
Going in circles and I just can't wait
Running left so we can get in shape
Get in shape because we can't escape
Running left because I'm already late
Really not, I'm in the exact same place
Running laps in your relationship
Running away from the subtleties of
The worlds always amazed at how much cash you made
But not at how you made it, it's just strange
It sounded kind of cool over the phone
It killed your neighbors and their dog and crushed their bones

You tortured little girl
Showing them what laughter's all about
Where did all the wine go?
Every night it's gone
You got it all worked out
Funny little girl
Showing them what pain is all about
Where did all the time go?
Every night it's gone, gone, gone
You're the coolest girl in this whole town
