There are bruises on your thighs
I can tell you're trying to hide
All the darkness in your mind
You got sawdust on your toes
From that sports bar down the road
You have beer glass in your feet
You say "kiss me on the cheek"
Some people get paid to talk
Some people get paid to listen
Some people buy a ticket
And can't wait for intermission
Just like some might love you blindly
Some might love you with conditions
Some will love you like an unloved child
Loves family traditions
Now she's tempted by the syringe
Try to rhyme a word with orange
I'm a cheap and ugly sinner
To whose soul love is so foreign
So if you're sideways
And if you wanna go my way
Before a meteor shower
Decides the Earth should be devoured
Whether you're locked up in the tower
Or if you charge them by the hour
In mama's eyes you were a flower
Forget the aftertaste of life gone sour
You might also likeWill you finish what you started?
Travel the seas you never parted
Remember things you disregarded
Communicate with the departed
Believe in things you thought weren't founded
Prepare to always be astounded
Or keep your dreams and visions grounded
It took a while but then I found it
No one inspired you in time
So you left your love behind
In a world that can discourage
One who's young and full of courage
You said you'd start at the bottom
But instead you start at the top
Be careful what you wish for
On your lap it just might drop
It's a lonely life at the bottom
It can be lonely too at the top
Make sure your heart is singing
Right until the day it stops
They all say dream
But what they mean is be specific or obscene
It's time to find some time to fail at what makes you most happy
Sometimes you concentrate on lovers
To forget everything else
Sometimes you hate each other to forget you hate yourself
So if you're sideways
And if you wanna go my way
Before a meteor shower
Decides the Earth be devoured
Whether you're locked up in the tower
Or if you charge them by the hour
Tell me you'll always be a flower
Forget the aftertaste of life gone sour
Will you finish what you started?
Before you celebrate with a cigar lit
Remember things you disregarded
Communicate with the departed
Prepare to always be astounded
Believe in things you thought weren't founded
Don't keep those dreams and visions grounded
