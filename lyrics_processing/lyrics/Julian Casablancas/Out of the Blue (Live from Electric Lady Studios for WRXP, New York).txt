Somewhere along the way my sadness turned to bitterness
Somewhere along the way my bitterness turned to anger
Somewhere along the way my anger turned to vengeance
And the ones that I make pay are never the ones who deserve it
And the ones who deserve it, they'll never understand it
Yes, I know I am going to hell in a purple basket
At least I will be in another world while you're pissing on my casket
How could you be
So perfect for me?
Why can't you ignore
The things I did before?
Somewhere along the way exacting vengeance gave excitement
Somewhere along the way that excitement turned to pleasure
Somewhere along the way that pleasure turned to madness
Sooner or later that kind of madness turns into pain
And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it
Those who helped me along the way, I smacked them as I thanked them
Yes, I know I am going to hell in a leather jacket
At least I will be in another world, while you're pissing on my casket
All that I can do is sing a song of faded glory
And all you got to do is sit there, look great and make them horny
Together we will sing songs and tell exaggerated stories
About the way we feel today and tonight and in the morning

So perfect for me?
Why can't you ignore
The things I did before?
And take all your fears
Pretend they're all true
And take all your plans
Pretend they fell through
And that's what it's like
That's what it's like for most people in this world
The rich or the poor
Muslims or Jews
When roles are reversed
Opinions are too, no
That's all I'm gonna say now
