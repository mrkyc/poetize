Cities of Gold, they always hold the promise in ruins
The fountain of youth we run into is just an illusion
A glass is always half full 'til you fill it to the top
I remember when you're with me, forget it when you're not

If life is a lesson, if love is an action
If pain is a weapon and sorrow's attraction
If you got a heartbeat, you know you got me
If a house is a building, then home is a feeling

Hickory floors, a swing on a porch don't meant a damn thing
Sheets on the bed ain't nothing but thread if they're always empty
With no one to wake to, to make the lonely stop
I remember when you're with me, I forget it when you're not

If life is a lesson, if love is an action
If pain is a weapon and sorrow's attraction
If you got a heartbeat then you know you got me
If a house is a building, then home is a feeling

Oh, stay calm and light
It's just you and I and I realize
You might also like
If life is a lesson, if love is an action
If pain is a weapon, then Nashville, y'all are my distraction
If you got a heartbeat then you know you got me
If a house is a building, then home is a feeling

If a house is a building, then home is a feeling

Nashville, thank you so much for giving me such an incredible home
And thank you all so much for making me feel at home here with y'all tonight
I greatly, greatly appreciate it


Encore! Encore!
I know I've said it a whole bunch of times
But thank you all so very much
Hey, thank you!
And I just hope that you all have had at least half as much fun as we've had
And it's, uh, nice to have so many friends and family here tonight
And all the fellas from Alabama
