Calico quilt and muscadine wine
Silver moon, candlelights
Pretty little girl, come here
I wanna tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman wants to hear

Fine Merlot that you had in my yard
A little bit of soul from the stars
Gonna lay you down, make it clear
I'll tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman wants to hear

So with a turn of my head and that cotton-red sundress
Sittin' cross-legged, bitchin' 'bout your ex
You're turnin' me on, when they call last call
You said, "Let's get out of here"
Pretty little girl, I'll make it clear
I'll tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman wants to hear

Wanna talk about tomorrow like it's a real thing
See you when it comes time next spring
Whisper nothings in your ear
I'll tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman wants to hear
You might also like
So with a turn of my head and that cotton-red sundress
Sittin' cross-legged, bitchin' 'bout your ex
You're turnin' me on, when they call last call
You said, "Let's get out of here"
Pretty little girl, I'll make it clear
I'll tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman wants to hear
I'll tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman wants to hear

With a turn of my head and that cotton-red sundress
Sittin' cross-legged, bitchin' 'bout your ex
You're turnin' me on, when they call last call
You said, "Let's get out of here"
Pretty little girl, I'll make it clear
I'll tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman wants to hear
Tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman wants to hear
Tell you what a woman
Tell you what a woman
