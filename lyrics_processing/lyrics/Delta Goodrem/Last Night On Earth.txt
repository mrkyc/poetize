It's the last night on Earth before the great divide
My hands are shaking, time was never on our side
And there's no such thing as a beautiful goodbye
As an ordinary day I prayed for you a thousand times

It's never enough
No matter how many times I tried to tell you
This is love

If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
And if tomorrow falls asleep
Can you hold me first?
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on Earth
Like it's the last night on Earth
Like it's the last night on Earth
Mmm...

A penny for your thoughts, a picture so it lasts
Let's knock down the walls of immortality
Your fingers on my skin
Only you can hear my fear
Only you can help me heal
I see forever with you here

It's never enough
No matter how many miles stand between us
This is love

If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
And if tomorrow falls asleep
Can you hold me first?
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on Earth

It's never enough
No, it's never enough
(It's never enough)
Oh
The afterglow
The horizon line
The shadows fall
Will you still be mine?
Will you still be mine?
Will you still be mine, I ask
If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
(And if tomorrow falls asleep) The day I die
(Can you hold me first?)
I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on Earth
(I'm gonna love you like...) Like it's the last night on Earth
(I'm gonna love you like...) It's the last night on Earth
It's never enough
(I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on Earth)
