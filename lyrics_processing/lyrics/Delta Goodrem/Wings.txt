A beating drum, it's in my lungs
I breathe it in, it takes my breath away
I don't look back, it's just a trap
We are all one but we're not the same

Everybody's looking for a new horizon
Everybody wants to leave the world behind them
Everybody's looking for a new horizon
Everybody's looking for a second chance
Everybody's wishing they could take a stand
Everybody's looking for a second chance

What if I lose my self control?
What if I choose to let it go?
I want to let you and me collide
Baby, these wings were made
These wings were made to fly (Fly-ly, fly-ly)

The deepest veins, the darkest truth
A secret place I only want to share with you
Look in my eyes, undress my soul, ooh

Everybody's looking for a second chance

What if I lose my self control?
