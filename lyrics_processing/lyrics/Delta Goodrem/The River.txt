Preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river

It's not what I had planned when I was walking in
I didn't know what I'd see, stepping through the door
Their clothes were on the floor
Was something like a bad dream

And then in just a blink, before I could think
I didn't know what happened
All I knew was this
How could he commit, a crime against our passion?

Oh, the moment that I saw them kiss
Oh, I knew it had to end like this

Preacher, take me down
Take me down to the river, river
I couldn't help myself
When I saw him with her, with her
I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
(river, river)
(river, river)

The writing's on the wall, but it was his fault
How could anybody blame me
I swear to tell the truth, and if you only knew
I swear, you'd do the same thing

Oh, if you give me one more chance
Oh, I'll never shoot him down again so...

Preacher, take me down
Take me down to the river, river
I couldn't help myself
When I saw him with her, with her
I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
River, river
Take me down
Preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
I couldn't help myself
When I saw him with her, with her
I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
Take me down the river, river
(river, river)
(river, river)

I took that loaded gun
Forgive what I have done
So preacher, take me down
