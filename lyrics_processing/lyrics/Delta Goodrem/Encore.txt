Can you hear the sound of the silence?
Hush, hush now
The spotlights fading away
Like a serenade of the quiet, drown it out
The choir leaving the stage

Every time you took my breath away
I lost something inside
Every time you threw me a bouquet
All the roses, they died
So I think it's time you walk away
The show is closing tonight
Yeah I think it's time you walk away, way, way

And don't come back for the encore, the encore
Don't come back like you want more, you want more
Can't you see that the curtain is closing?
You can't cut me open no more
Don't come back for the applause, the applause
Cause I'm already long gone, I'm long gone
Can't you see that the show's all over?
Confetti all over the floor

Don't come back for the encore

Can you hear the beat of my heart go
Boom, boom, boom?
But it's not beating for you
Like a symphony in the dark
We lost our tune
Don't you think our time is through?

Every time you took my breath away
I lost something inside
Every time you threw me a bouquet
All the roses, they died
And I think it's time you walk away
The show is closing tonight
Yeah, I think it's time you walk away, way, way
