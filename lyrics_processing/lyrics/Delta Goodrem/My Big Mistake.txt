Mr reliable romantic was you
Blinded misguided in the arms of love
Just 'cause it suited the both of us
Then it all went wrong
I'm the one to blame
Taking you for granted
In so many ways
When i look back now
How can i ever forget
You make me so happy
The day we met
How could something so magic magic
Become something so tragic tragic
Right before my eyes
Two separate lives
Every second was a precious moment
Now i'm thinking about the path i've chosen
Wish i could un-make my big mistake
My mistake
Communication had broken down
This situation was out of our hands
Well my hands
You've got to please understand
That i was too young, yes just
Too young for that
I guess it all went wrong
And i'm the one to blame
But what i would give to have you back again

My mistake
The days the weeks the months
The years that we have wasted
I'm sorry
I still love you
I don't expect a call 'cause my apology's belated
I'm sorry
And i miss you all my life
