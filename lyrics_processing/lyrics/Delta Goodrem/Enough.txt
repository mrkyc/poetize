They used to tell me I wasn't smart enough
Said I'll never make, I don't resemble the stars enough
Man, I'm just try'na get my heart to pump
Gave me all every time, I guess my all wasn't enough
They said I talk too much, they talk enough
Told me I should change, but never said what I should change it to...
Man, I'm just try'na play the game witch-u
So when you gon' see I'm just me, I ain't the same as you

I just wanna give my all, the rise and fall
The works
I just wanna leave my mark upon your heart
The world

What do I gotta say? How do I gotta pray?
What do I gotta do? Tell me
Who do I gotta be? Whaddya want from me?
What do I gotta prove?
No matter what I do
I'm not breaking for you, tell me
What do I gotta give, how do I gotta live
When it's not enough for you?
It's not enough... for you

Well, my first mistake was try'na please everybody
Only to realise I ain't need anybody (nobody)
But all I ever wanted was acceptance
Till I accepted myself, now I can check that off my checklist
I am no longer, checking for your guest list
Or where I land on your best list
I look at my reflection and it tells me who the best is
So I could never do it like the rest did

I just wanna give my all, the rise and fall
The works
I just wanna leave my mark upon your heart
The world

What do I gotta say? How do I gotta pray?
What do I gotta do? Tell me
Who do I gotta be? Whaddya want from me?
What do I gotta prove?
No matter what I do
I'm not breaking for you, tell me
What do I gotta give, how do I gotta live
When it's not enough for you?
When it's not enough for you?
Let's go..

I know they wanna see me break
I know they'd rather see me fall
And that's the very reason why
I'ma rise above it all
They used to say I wasn't a star
Said, Wasn't going very far
Well, now I'm shining like a star
And I'm screaming out my cause, cause you can't be back tomorrow

What do I gotta say? How do I gotta pray?
What do I gotta do? Tell me
Who do I gotta be? Whaddya want from me?
What do I gotta prove?
No matter what I do
I'm not breaking for you, tell me (I'm not breaking for you)
What do I gotta give, how do I gotta live
When it's not enough for you?

What do I gotta say? How do I gotta pray?
What do I gotta do? Tell me
Who do I gotta be? Whaddya want from me?
What do I gotta prove? (What do I gotta prove)
No matter what I do
I'm not breaking for you, tell me
What do I gotta give, how do I gotta live?
When it's not enough for you?
(it's enough for me though)
It's not enough for you
(it's enough for me)
It's not enough for you
It's not enough for you (yeah, yeah)
