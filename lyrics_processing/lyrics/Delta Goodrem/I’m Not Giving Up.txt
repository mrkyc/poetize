There's beauty in your sadness
There is love in every teardrop rolling down your face
There is heartbreak in the sunshine
There is healing in the storms behind the clouds you chase

Some days you feel the rain
That's never gonna change but...

If I could do it all again, would I do it differently?
Baby, I made some choices that left me feeling empty
But I know I got the strength inside to always rise above
So I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up,ooohh

There's power in the madness
There is presence in the truth of letting go
And the words that fill your head
Become the world you see around you, keep it close

It's hard to see what's meant to be
But something's telling me that
