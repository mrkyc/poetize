I fought a battle, I fought a war
I felt the rain on my face
Sometimes to find what you're looking for
You've gotta learn from your worst mistakes

I made a wish on a satellite
That I mistook for a star
Guess when you build up to break down
You find out who you really are

How did it all get so heavy?
I used to stand up so tall
There's only so much I can carry before I fall
And they tell me, "girl you're so lucky"
"You've got the world in your hands"
But you know the world gets so heavy
You don't understand and that's heavy

Just tell me, what's the intention?
Is it to fall in love?
I tried to find a connection
Between how it is and how it was

I made a promise I couldn't keep
Another story to tell
You swear to god that you know me
But I don't, don't even know myself

How did it all get so heavy?
I used to stand up so tall
There's only so much I can carry before I fall
And they tell me, "girl you're so lucky"
"You've got the world in your hands"
But you know the world gets so heavy
You don't understand and that's heavy

Sometimes I lay awake in bed at night
I close my eyes and all I see is see the dreams
I used to dream about when I was younger
I wonder where I took the path of no return
I might've lost my way a hundred times
But no I never ever lost the hunger
Oh, and I know every cut
And every stitch and every scar
I know they've gotten me this far
They only made me tough, they made me stronger
But when it's hard to breathe
And I just can't get off the floor
I long for days when I was free
A life I lived so long before
How did it all get so heavy?
I used to stand up so tall
There's only so much I can carry before I fall
And they tell me, "girl you're so lucky"
"You've got the world in your hands"
But you know the world gets so heavy
