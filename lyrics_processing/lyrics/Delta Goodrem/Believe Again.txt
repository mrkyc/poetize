Have you ever stared into the rain?
Thought the clouds would never disappear
Have you ever screamed out in the dark?
Thinking no one else could hear

I was leaving footprints tainted by my past
On this winding road to you, ooh

I'd lost my faith in love
Tonight, I believe again
My heart was a broken place
And now, I feel whole again
And you bring me honesty
And that's worth believing in
And I believe, I believe again

Have you ever spun out of control? (Ooh)
Like you never saw the road ahead (Ooh)
Have you ever just kept looking back? (Ooh)
Ever closer to the edge

I was praying for the light I see in your eyes
I had all, but given up

I'd lost my faith in love (I'd lost my faith in love)
Tonight, I believe again (Tonight, I believe again)
My heart was a broken place
And now, I feel whole again (I feel whole again)
And you bring me honesty (Ooh)
And that's worth believing in
And I believe (I believe, I believe), I believe again

(Ooh, ooh)
(I believe the impossible is possible to overcome)
(I believe in the miracles, born from love in everyone)
(I believe the impossible is possible to overcome)
(I believe in the miracles, born from love in everyone)
(I believe the impossible is possible to overcome)
(I believe in the miracles, born from love in everyone)
(I believe the impossible is possible to overcome)
(I believe in the miracles, born from love in everyone)

I'd lost my faith in love
Tonight, I believe again (I believe again)
My heart was a broken place
And now, I feel whole again (I feel whole again)
And you bring me honesty (Ooh)
And that's worth believing in (Oh)
And I believe (And I believe again)
And I believe, I believe again
