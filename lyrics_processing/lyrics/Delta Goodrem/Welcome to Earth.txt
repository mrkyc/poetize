Welcome to Earth
Where the broken and the beautiful collide
Don't know what you've heard
But the dark is what will lead you to your light
Let go of the answers
Just hold on to mystery, yeah
Welcome to Earth
There's a world out there that's waiting to be seen, oh

Let your spirit fly, and your soul reach out
Brothers and sisters, together now
We're the human race, its who we are
This is our home, born from the stars

Make this moment all you've wanted
We are here together, standing proud
Make this moment all you've wanted
We were made to live our dreams out loud

Welcome to Earth
Where the things you love can bring you to your knees
Around the world
You gotta find a way to turn your war to peace
You just can't change the storms that come your way
Welcome to Earth
Where a heart can be reborn after the rain
