Let me let me tell you bout my homeboy CORey
This the first verse of the very first story
Call it the first letter, you can call it whateva
Long as you hear the truth and leave surer than eva
CORey's a new believer actin like he's in a gang
Runnin round sayin his church is the greatest thang
Won't check a sermon unless it's his bishop's name
It seems he forgot to keep Jesus the main thang
Cause bishop ain't raise up after three days up
He ain't take your case up offerin you his grace huh
But CORey stay divided all of the time
Not Christ but a man that he's standin behind

I got this little letter, I'm tryna break it down
So you can hear the truth in the sound
Division, a whole lot of sin
I can't forget the problems of people livin within

I got this little letter, I'm tryna break it down
But let me tell you CORey backround
He started off crazy, party's full of shawtys
Religious ceremonies where people was gettin naughty
But all that changed, the truth of God reigned
The Gospel spread within him like viruses in his veins
But mayne even though his heart's rearranged
He found himself caught up in some of his old ways
He layin up with women and sinnin was gettin strange
He thought the more he sinned the more Jesus was pleased to save
He thought cause he accepted his brother touchin his mother
That he was spiritual cause he let em get with each other
And CORey had beef with another in the faith
Instead of workin through it they opened a court case
A slap to the face in the God who gives grace
Now CORey's outta place tryna carry his own weight
You might also like
Now CORey got married, but everywhere he turned
He sees lust burn and women waitin to serve him
And CORey's learnin, Satan wishes to turn him
Away from his wife, to satisfy all his yearnings
Divorce ain't legitimate if both are regenerate
What God put together let nobody put a split in it
See that ain't the end of it, he sought his own benefit
He would do the things that his friends saw as forbiddin it
Though it was no sin in it his homies they was ignorant
They were made weak cause his liberty was the hindrance
Unlike an apostle no concern for the gospel
