I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C (Fanatic)
I rep Christ 'til I D-I-E (Fanatic)
I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith
To serve a God who's extremely great, I'm a fanatic (X2)

The world's tryna tidy up, exfoliate they skin
But only Christ can come and exfoliate they sin
And they fate look grim, if they don't take Him
As the High Priest He is to mediate they sin
The world got too many gods, man we choose the One
From Hebrews, He rules, He bruised His Son
He moves the sun
So if we praying and our schools call us fools
Coz our God's too true to shun
Channels two and one, man it looks insane
TV make a lot of Christians seem dramatically strange
Though we may be looked upon as one and the same
We will not turn in shame, we proclaim the Name
Christ Jesus, believe us, you ain't gotta receive us
But we gone follow our God, wherever the Bible lead us
And you can call us dramatic, fanatic, emphatic
But hey while you at it, take a look at our mathematics

You might also like
What can I do to make it simple, make it plain
Christ came, emptied Himself and let our sin hang Him
You couldn't blame Him for any sin, while they singing many men
The crucifixion was pretty grim
But when we state the fact that God resurrects
We get funny looks from a world that doesn't get
That we are not David Koresh or Krishna
Or the people on TV who glorifying the bishop
From Edwards to Piper, MacArthur to Spurgeon
From Dallas to France, from Cali to Berlin
There's Christians all over who getting the word in
We ain't crazy, we just understand the truth and we burdened
The world sees us Evangelical Christians
As narrow-minded fanatics with a mythical mission
Labeled extremists for sharing our faith
But that's cool, we can carry the weight of persecution
Coz earth is losing, and if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God's using
So keep it moving coz if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God's using


They thought Jesus was out of His mind, they laughed and mocked Him
Called Him a cult leader and they tried to stop Him
Pharisees said Christ got His power from Satan
Hating on the very One that came to save 'em
Even after He rose man the world ain't changed
They still rejecting the Name, still look at us strange
Still tell us without shame that our faith's insane
And it don't take all that to be a Christian mayne
And it's hard when you tryna reach your family and stuff
They say, man you too spiritual, you doing too much
So we show 'em the love of Christ and live in the light
So they can glorify our God when they look at our life
And we win, for sharing the truth and hearts get changed
We win, if we're rejected because of His name
We win, if seeds get planted and watered to grow
