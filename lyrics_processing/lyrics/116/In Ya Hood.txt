Lord it's obvious they don't know You
But they need to know You
I pray they would meet You through us
That's why we out here
 x2
Aww man y'all done messed up and let us in ya hood
To preach the Way the Truth the Life in ya hood
Forget the 'lac with the steering wheel made of wood
It's time we see the truth of Christ in ya hood

I'll never stop what I'm doing
Grooving moving for Jesus
Steady grinding in the streets
Just to reach all of my people
Momma, daddy, sister, auntie
Brother, uncle, cousin and them
It's time we get it in for Jesus
Start a buzz up for Him
Man but somethings always stopping you
Maybe your love for sin
Or the lack of love you showing
When you cursing at men
Man how holy is He to you
How impressed by Him are you
Is your life a story all about Him
Or dawg does it star you?
The answer's your actions
The fruit of your passions
Plus the proof of the facts
And who it is that you casting
Make a switch, change your role
116 became the mould
The word to the Colossians
To know God is in control
You might also like
Hey dawg its T-dot
Coming from the street block
Just to rep the chief Rock
Cause I peep that He's not
In the place where He's got
The chief spot
In ya life like the top
Cause life is all headed for the end
Like the sign that reads stop
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust
You breathe in, breathe out
Then its back to the dirt
The fact of the earth
Is life is nothing more but vain glory
Your born, you suffer
You die, it's the same story
So come on dawg get closer
To the life of this Teacher
The Preacher, Savior, Creator
Our Lord, King, and our Leader
Of this Holy Culture movement
Man he might insult your crew when
When you get in to make it in
You gotta go through Him
You're a sinner, He's the Savior
Your're created, He's Creator
But no matter how you spin it
You gon have to meet the Maker
It goes
Love, Joy
Hope and Peace
My motivation for the ministry
While hitting the streets
Man we aliens
Soled out on a mission
Fishing for heathens
Representing the kingdom
I'm praying that this truth can reach em
Like a telegram message
That was sent through the wire
Or a Pauline epistle
Thats Divinely inspired
Cause all men need Jesus
Just like air to your lung
So in order to truly live
Dawg I dare you to come
Stop trying to do it yourself
Like McNabb on the run
Cause no man is worthy enough
To compare to the Son
Or foot the bill for our sin
That no money can pay
So all your good works now
Are worthless without faith
And only Jesus Christ
Can truly free Pimp C
Even if he get up out of prison
Dawg he still ain't free
So remember without Him
We're a heartbeat from Hell
Confess the name and rep it well
