Oh, what a time
The stars are brightly shining
It was the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

(Oh, what a time)
What Child is this?
Whose crown is this?
On the ground I live
Falling on my knees
Giving everything to the King of kings
