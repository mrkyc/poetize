Baby you don't even know it, but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby I surrender it's too late for me to get your hands off, hands off
Get your hands off my heart

Trying to keep myself together, but I'm losing my mind every second that I think of you
Stealing every single piece of me like loving's a crime
It should be illegal what you do

There's only so much I can take
I tried so hard, I can't escape
Your body's always in my way
There you are
There you are

Baby you don't even know it, but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby I surrender it's too late for me to get your hands off, hands off
Get your hands off my heart
Get your hands off my heart

She's a maneater
Damn schemer
Caught her on the bus with the band leader
Girl-girl gone bad, so deceiving
Hot was she coming, cold leaving
Taking what you wanted here, too good to be true
Always heard about the warning, never thought it'd be you
Take-taking a chance like I was the man
While she leaving with my heart in her hands

There's only so much I can take
I tried so hard, I can't escape
Your body's always in my way
There you are
There you are

Baby you don't even know it, but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby I surrender it's too late for me to get your hands off, hands off
Get your hands off my heart

You got me trying to break free
But your hands on my heart, got a hold of me
I don't know, is this really how it's supposed to be?
Or am I in a cold and I'm feenin' - Jodeci
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
You got me laying dead in the streets surrounded by chalk
I knew what you was doing from the start, but couldn't stop
Squeezing with your hands around my heart till it pops (pop)
Take your hands off, hands off, off me
Take your hands off, hands off, off me
Take your hands off, hands off, off me
Take 'em off me
Take 'em off me

Baby you don't even know it, but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby I surrender it's too late for me to get your hands off, hands off
Get your hands off my heart


You can follow baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh you might not like the places you go
Got you by surprise
(Burn babe)
Caught you in your lies
(The worst way)
Now there's no disguise
(You're thirsty)
Every time I say goodbye
(No mercy)
I'm in the Merci
Whiplashes, I'll fly right past you, see you later
And what you can't see
Is that me leaving you, is doing you a favor?
Cause I can't be
Trust that my words only cut like a razor
Trust that my words, it's okay like a vapor
I'm a real heartbreaker
You can follow baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh you might not like the places you go
Tell me what you'd like
(Blank stare)
Tell me what you want in life
(No care)
Welcome to my (nightmare)
You should run and hide
(I don't play fair)
You wanna play here?
Well I make the rules and I weren't gonna break them
Baby stay clear
As soon as I'm done and I'm out and I blaze one
We could blow beer
You stood up loving me, later you hater
It's not my fault that you fell for me baby
When I played you wasted
You can follow baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh you might not like the places you go
