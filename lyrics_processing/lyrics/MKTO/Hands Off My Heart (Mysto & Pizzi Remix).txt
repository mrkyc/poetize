You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender; it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
Tryna keep myself together, but I'm losing my mind
Every second that I think of you (ooh yeah)
Stealing every single piece of me, like loving's a crime
It should be illegal, what you do
There's only so much I can take
I tried so hard; I can't escape
Your body's always in my way
There you are, there you are
Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender; it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
(Off me) ooh yeah
(Off me) get your hands off my heart, ooh yeah
Take your hands off, hands off, off me
Take your hands off, get your hands off my heart (get your)
Ha! Hands off, off me, take 'em off me, take 'em off me

Caught her on the bus with the band leader
Good girl gone bad, so deceiving
Hot when she's coming, cold when leaving
Tell you what you wanna hear; you're too good to be true (woah)
Always heard about the warning, never thought it'd be you (be you)
Taking a chance, like I was the man
But she's leaving with my heart in her hands
There's only so much I can take
I tried so hard; I can't escape
Your body's always in my way
There you are, there you are
Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender; it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender; it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
(Off me) ooh yeah
(Off me) get your hands off my heart, ooh yeah
Take your hands off, hands off, off me
Take your hands off, get your hands off my heart (get your)
Ha! Hands off, off me, take 'em off me, take 'em off me
Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender; it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
(Get your hands off my heart)
You don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
(Get your hands off my heart)
