I'll go wherever you go
Chase you through the streets of Monaco
I'll run wherever you are, oh
I trust the rivers lead me to your heart

Every night, every day
(Whatever the world the story of us takes me)
Lost in the light of your flame
(Whatever girl, wherever you need, baby)
Nothing will get in my way
(Not a thing)
Oh, even if the brightest star burns out tonight

Why don't you close your eyes
And we can leave it all behind
Wake up in paradise
Where the sunset never dies
We'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Never say, never never say
Never say bye, never ask why
Baby, don't you know we the stars in the sky?
Never say never, cause never don't fly
Baby, don't you know we the stars in the sky?
You might also like
I'll go wherever you go
To win your heart, Princess of Monaco
Daylight never seems to fade away
When I feel your love raining on my parade

Every night, every day
(Whatever the world the story of us takes me)
Lost in the light of your flame
(Whatever girl, wherever you need, baby)
Nothing will get in my way
(Not a thing)
Oh, even if the brightest star burns out tonight

Why don't you close your eyes
And we can leave it all behind
Wake up in paradise
Where the sunset never dies
We'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Never say, never never say
Never say bye, never ask why
Baby, don't you know we the stars in the sky?
Never say never, cause never don't fly
Baby, don't you know we the stars in the sky?
You hear me calling your name
But I don't know if all my words are drifting away
You hear me calling your name
Won't let you down if the sun falls from the sky
Oh, if the brightest star burns out tonight

Why don't you close your eyes
And we can leave it all behind
Wake up in paradise
Where the sunset never dies
We'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Why don't you close your eyes
And we can leave it all behind
Wake up in paradise
Where the sunset never dies
We'll never say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Never say, never never say
Never say bye, never ask why
Baby, don't you know we the stars in the sky?
Never say never, cause never don't fly
