Never know, never know

Sure he's got the money, but he's rude and he's cold
Rude and he's cold, but she's with him though
She sat up straight and stuning but I'm broke as a bad joke
Broke as a bad joke, which makes me a no go
She's always talking bout
She lookin out for the right guy
But she just can't find
So baby in the mean time
She deal with this
The guy that's rich
But he might make her cry
A fellow like me get no try
And I just don't know why, don't know why
What she doesn't see
Is that I just might be
What she's lookin for
What she's lookin for
If you look in my heart
Girl and I'm on my knees
What you're lookin for
What you're lookin for
Could be me
What you're lookin for
Could be me

She could do better but the money is her drug
Money is her drug, she's only tough
Uh girl I may be borrowing people
But I'm wealthy in their love
Wealthy in their love, I got more than enough
But she wants nice cars and fancy things
Even though she may be suffering
And I'm gonna treat her like a queen
But can't afford the crown, though she turn me down
A million dollar home, don't feel the same when you know a low
I really wanna show her so much more than dough
But the girl won't put me on yea
What she doesn't see
Is that I just might be
What she's lookin for
What she's lookin for
If you look in my heart
Girl and I'm on my knees
What you're lookin for
What you're lookin for

She keeps on searchin for the wrong man
With the iced out Cartier on hand
So mean but he look like Tarzan
Little bitch but he act real hard man
And she don't know
I got a heart made of gold
And the diamonds in my eyes are the size of the globe
Grade A, not a average Joe
But you never know, never know
And when you're finally scared and alone
I could be the one to answer the phone
Boss up like a CEO
On half, MKTO
So baby when you're done lookin for the top
I'mma be everywhere that he's not
I got everything and more than he's got
It could be me, give me a shot
What she doesn't see
Is that I just might be
What she's lookin for
What she's lookin for
If you look in my heart
Girl and I'm on my knees
What you're lookin for
What you're lookin for
Could be me
