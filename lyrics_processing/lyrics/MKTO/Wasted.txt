Before she even falls asleep
I got one foot out the door, one foot out the door
I think she said her name but I was wasted
I don't care anymore, one foot out the door

Night after night, day after day
Jack and Coke, smokin' on the fire escape
Is it too soon or is it too late?

Am I crazy to think that I could be in love
When it all ends up, it all ends up wasted?
I'd give you my heart but I'd just fuck it up
And we'd end up, we'd end up wasted

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Trying to numb the pain away
I know how to leave but not to stay
I wonder if I will ever find someone to fill me up inside
Someone to kiss my fears away
If I believed in God I'd pray, to God I'd pray
You might also like
Am I crazy to think that I could be in love
When it all ends up, it all ends up wasted?
I'd give you my heart, but I'd just fuck it up
And we'd end up, we'd end up wasted

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Night after night, day after day
Jack and Coke, smokin' on the fire escape
Is it too soon or is it too late?

Am I crazy to think that I could be in love
When it all ends up, it all ends up wasted?
I'd give you my heart but I'd just fuck it up
And we'd end up, we'd end up wasted
I said we'd end up wasted, oh oh

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
