Somewhere off in outer space
There's a world, no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it

We are all gathered here right now
I can feel it, it's about to go down
There's a time and a place for a face in the crowd
And today is the day, stand out
Stand up, stand your ground
Be the "who" that you are and be proud
And when you feel that you can't make a sound
Right there is the time when you're supposed to get loud
You don't like those rules, remake 'em
'Cause we live in snow globes, shake 'em
You don't like what it was, then change what it is
Good stories only are what you make 'em
Wake up, get up and do something
You gotta wake up, get up and do something
Yeah, it don't take much but a simple equation
You plus your imagination

Somewhere off in outer space
There's a world, no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it
You might also like
Right here, I can almost touch it
So near, we could live in our world
No fear
If you with me say "Yeah!"
(Just imagine it)
Right here, I can see it all crystal clear
We can flip the whole atmosphere
If you with me say "Yeah!"
(Just imagine it)

I live in a world that's in pain
You too where the streets have no name
'Cause a untreated vet with a mental defect
Is about to get a Glock, that's insane
Man, we sit on the brink with a drink in a hand
And the other with a grip on an iPhone
Never looking in each other's eyes
Let alone at the stars
One day, wonder where the time goes
Zombies waking up when the ball drops
Too many hearts stop beating when no heart stops
Can't wait for the world to change
It's like waiting for the end of days
You gotta wake up, get up and do something
We gotta wake up, get up and do something
Yeah, it ain't gonna be perfect
Nothing ever has
But we could try, just imagine that
Somewhere off in outer space
There's a world, no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it
Somewhere far off past the stars
Where the light shines in the dark
Where you could be just who you are
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it

Right here, I can almost touch it, so near
We could live in our world, no fear
If you with me say "Yeah!"
Right here, I can see it all crystal clear
We can flip the whole atmosphere
If you with me say "Yeah!"
(I just imagine it)
I hope you can see it, yeah
I hope you can see it now
Oh
(Just imagine it)

Somewhere off in outer space
There's a world, no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it
Somewhere far off past the stars
Where the light shines in the dark
Where you could be just who you are
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it
I wanna believe
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
So I just imagine it
Somewhere off in outer space
There's a world, no wars, no hate
Where all the broken hearts are safe
I don't know where it is
I just imagine it
Somewhere far off past the stars
