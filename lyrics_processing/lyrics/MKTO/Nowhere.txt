She keeps me fed, breast and some legs
Well done, yeah, well done
You go to work every day and I work my Xbox
You wear yo high heels, I'm high scoring in my socks
You learn the right time to go buy me a new watch
You never asked for a key
So I never had to change the locks

You know what I like so give me what I want
And girl I'll never go nowhere
Give me love at night, love in the morning
And girl I'll never go nowhere

I know I maybe askin' for much
But baby I don't really care
I know I maybe sound a bit nuts
But girl I wouldn't go nowhere
Nowhere (nowhere)
Nowhere (nowhere)
Nowhere (nowhere)
Girl I'll never go nowhere

Spending company money, drinkin' company champagne (spend it all)

You know what I like so give me what I want
And girl I'll never go nowhere
Give me love at night, love in the morning
And girl I'll never go nowhere

I know I maybe askin' for much

Malcolm in the middle I'm yo lay
Throw a party for me every day like soiree
Charging up the cars like a bull say ole
