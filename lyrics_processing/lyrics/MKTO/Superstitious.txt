Baby, got me frozen, looking at you, you're so cold in that dress
Damn girl, so hot, I'm burning up, it's like I gotta say yes
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got me cutting corners, anything to just get closer to you
Nothing could stop me, nah nah, nothing baby I wouldn't do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mmm yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, ain't gonna let love pass me by

Give me some good love and grant these wishes
(One) I just wanna make you my Mrs
(Two, three) It's you and me, are you with this?
Yeah, we can go the distance (Come on)

You and I, in my mind, don't nobody pinch me
It's so good, knock on wood, crossing fingers, baby
We could make it last forever, never look back
Don't wanna close my eyes and miss this
You got me superstitious

Girl, you got me paranoid, I'm seeing things that ain't even there
Hallucinating thinking shadows follow me everywhere
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mmm mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Tryna keep up with you, but no matter what, I'm moving too slow
Wrapped up my fingers, if I had you I would never let go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, you know I would never let go, oh no, no

If you a bad girl, can't resist this
So bad, got me getting into mischief
Eleven out of ten, yeah, you're looking so delicious
Got me superstitious
I'm doing anything 'cause I don't wanna jinx this
Green around my wrist, green up in my pocket
It's clovers, don't trip
Lucky Charms for breakfast, yeah, makes sense
Stepping over cracks every chance I get, yeah

Give me some good love and grant these wishes
(One) I just wanna make you my Mrs
(Two, three) It's you and me, are you with this?

You and I, in my mind, don't nobody pinch me
