No more plastic lies
No more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye
You only live once, no second chance
She says I go from the Hulk to Mr. Romantic
The call me saying I been a ghost and I pull up in the phantom
I'm about to get the money moving I can't sit still, imma leaving you standing
Everything we had is all gone
Not one more chance, I've moved on
I'm doing me so you do you
You do you
Cuz this is my only life
So I've got to let you go
You should have been only mine
So I'm walking out the door
Singing
No more second chances
No more plastic lies
No more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye
She only want my ricotta
Aces of spades and vodka
She trying to be my flame like waka flock
What the fucka
GPS on my phone and a bug in the house like she a stalker
She trying to lock me down with her pie like she some Betty Crocker
No more games no old news
Putting new words to an old tune
Just get out the box with I love you (?)
I love you
Cuz this is my only life
So I've got to let you go
You should have been only mine
So I'm walking out the door
Singing
No more second chances
No more plastic lies
No more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye
Jessica:
Trying to say I'm crazy but it's you that chased me
Ain't no black and white this gray's a different shade of shady
Remember when I caught yo fingers creeping on me
Texting her at midnight
Boy you test the phone geek
And I looked right past it like it was old news
And I told myself, why should I doubt you?
I'm about to turn the tables on you, I'm about to turn the tables on you
No more second chances
No more plastic lies
No more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye
Baby please don't go
Is there anything that I can say
Baby please don't go
Baby I'm begging you
Tell me is it a crime of mine to change my mind?
