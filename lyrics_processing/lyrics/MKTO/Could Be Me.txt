Never know, never know
Never know, never know
Never know, never know (MKTO)
Never know, never know (Ne-Yo, what's up?)
Never know, never know
Never know, never know
Never know, never know
Never know, never know

Johnny's got the money
But he's rude and he's so cold
Rude and he's so cold
But she's with him, though
She said I'm sweet as honey
But I'm broke as a bad joke
Broke as a bad joke
Which makes me a no-go

She's always talking 'bout she looking out for the right guy
But she just can't find, so in the meantime
She deal with this, the guy that's rich
But he might make her cry, a fella like me get no try
And I just don't know why, don't know why
You might also like
What she doesn't see is that I just might be
What she looking for, what she looking for
If you look in my heart, girl, and not my money
What you're looking for, what you're looking for could be me

What you're looking for could be me

Never know, never know (know)
Never know, never know (what)
Never know, never know
Never know, never know (hey)

She could do better, but the money is her drug
Money is her drug, she's on it tough
Ooh, girl, I may be poor in paper, but I'm wealthy in real love
Wealthy in real love, I got more than enough

But she wants nice cars and fancy things
Even though she may be suffering
A man that'd treat her like a queen
But can't afford the crown, no, she turned me down
A million dollar home don't feel the same when you're alone
I really want to show her so much more than dough
But the girl won't put me on, yeah
What she doesn't see is that I just might be
What she looking for, what she looking for
If you look in my heart, girl, and not my money
What you're looking for, what you're looking for could be me

What you're looking for could be me
What you're looking for could be me

She keeps on searching for the wrong man
With the iced out Cartier armband
So mean but he look like Tarzan
Little bitch, but he act real hard, man
And she don't know, I got a heart made of gold
And the diamonds in my eyes are the size of the globe
Grade A, not an average Joe
But you never know, never know
And when you're feeling scared and alone
I could be the one to answer the phone
Boss up, like a CEO, one half, MKTO
So, baby, when you're done looking for the top
I'ma be everywhere that he's not
I got everything and more than he's got
It could be me, give me a shot
What she doesn't see is that I just might be
What she looking for, what she looking for
If you look in my heart, girl, and not my money
What you're looking for, what you're looking for could be me

What you're looking for could be me
