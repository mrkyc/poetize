Forever and ever and ever
Girl I, I'm gonna hold you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow baby I got bills to pay
But since you're here today
And take my breath away
Girl I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow
You keep hanging with my whole crew, swearin that you like me
Sayin that you wanna be the one to wear my Nikes
Comin on strong, yea over the top
I would do anything to get to stop
To the tic toc but I can't knock
How you keep rockin the fingers in my pocket
Crazy how you want it like it never ever more
When all I know is hit it and you hit the door
But maybe, just maybe
I'm tired of tryna fight it
Nobody, nobody
Can tell me that you shouldn't turn me on
When something so right it can't be wrong
Girl I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Girl I, I'm gonna hold you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow baby I got bills to pay
But since you're here today
And take my breath away
Girl I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow
I ain't lookin for a spouse yet, lookin for a house pet
You keep telling me to look in over houses
Baby that ain't a way to turn me on
Quit tryin to make lunch pays but my mom
Hold up with your hold up
Got again in my face, tryna set a wedding ring
Baby you can tell me, give me serious advice
When all I want from you is to get serious tonight
But maybe, just maybe
I'm tired of tryna fight it
Nobody, nobody
Can tell me that you shouldn't turn me on
When something so right it can't be wrong
Girl I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Girl I, I'm gonna hold you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow baby I got bills to pay
But since you're here today
And take my breath away
Girl I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow
1-2, 1-2-3-4
Why not tell you you're the one today?
Who knows what I'm gonna feel tomorrow?
Why not tell you you're the one today?
Who knows what I'm gonna feel tomorrow?
