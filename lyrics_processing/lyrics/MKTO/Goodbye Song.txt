Yeah I'mma put your shit out on the lawn
Leave my heart and take your bong
There's nothing left to say, so long (MKTO)
This is your goodbye, goodbye song

La la la la la
This is your goodbye song
La la la la la

I waited for you till six in the morning
You said the party was over at 4 and
No word, no calls, no text
Someone's about to be my next ex, next ex
And I've been sitting here watching reruns
Even Betty White's lookin' at me like a bum
I've called every single person I know and
I guess I don't know the one that you bonin'

So what am I to do? (Girl what am I to do)
I'm up to here with you (Cause I'm up to here with you)
I can't believe you threw it all away (Uh oh Come on)
You might also like
So I'mma put your shit out on the lawn
Leave my heart and take your bong
There's nothing left to say, so long
This is your goodbye, goodbye song
I used your pictures on the wall
You can find 'em in the bathroom stall
There's nothing left to say, it's all so wrong

This is your goodbye song
La la la la la
This is your goodbye song
La la la la la

Promises, promises, broken frames
Uh, shoes, clothes, everything brand names
Start a bonfire, yeah, light it up
B-Y-O-B everybody bring a cup, yup
We gonna dance on the memories of us
So here's a toast to how we screwed it up
To make sure there's a happy ending
I'm gonna hook up with your mom (Call me)

So what am I to do (What am I to do)
I'm still in love with you (I'm still in love with you)
Can't believe you threw it all away
So I'mma put your shit out on the lawn
Leave my heart and take your bong (Take your bong)
There's nothing left to say, so long
This is your goodbye, goodbye song
I used your pictures on the wall
You can find 'em in the bathroom stall
There's nothing left to say, it's all so wrong
This is your goodbye song

La la la la la
This is your goodbye song
La la la la la

Goodbye
Goodbye
Have a nice life

What, uh, baby, eh, sayonara, hasta la vista
I'll be outta here if I can only get a visa
It was good while it lasted, but now it's in the past
In case you didn't get it, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, have a nice life
Whoa-oh-oh

Well now that all that's said, baby you know uh
I have to go do something
I locked my keys in the car
I gotta go take somebody somewhere
I'm taking off I gotta go, bye

Oh whoa
Baby goodbye, baby goodbye
Now come on, girl, come on

So I'mma put your shit out on the lawn
Leave my heart and take your bong (Baby leave my heart)
There's nothing left to say, so long
This is your goodbye, goodbye song
I used your pictures on the wall
You can find 'em in the bathroom stall
There's nothing left to say, it's all so wrong
This is your goodbye song

La la la la la
(Goodbye song, now baby)
This is your goodbye song
La la la la la
(Goodbye song)
This is your goodbye song
