Yo, this one right here is for all the drop out-of-schoolers
The future cougars, the Mary Jane abusers, the ones that chose to be losers
For all the misfit kids and the total outcasts
MKTO, This one's for you, role models

We are the ones, the ones you left behind
Don't tell us how, tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong, we're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing 'cause there's nothing left to lose

Thank you for feeding us years of lies
Thank you for the wars you left us to fight
Thank you for the world you ruined overnight
But we'll be fine, yeah, we'll be fine
Thank you for the world you broke, like yolk and it ain't no joke
So cold and there ain't no coat, just me, my friends, my folks and
We gonna do what we like so raise that bird up high
And when they ask you why, just stand there, laugh and smile

We are the ones, the ones you left behind
Don't tell us how, tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong, we're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing 'cause there's nothing left to lose

Thank you for the times you said don't make a sound
Thanks for the ropes you used to hold us down
Cause when I break through I'ma use them to reach the clouds
We ain't comin' down, we ain't comin' down (C'mon)
Look, Ma, I finally made it, this world is too damn jaded
My life is just like Vegas, go big, go home, get faded
Been a prob' since '92, can't shut me down, curfew
And them girls, I'll take a few, do what I wanna do

We are the ones, the ones you left behind
Don't tell us how, tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong, we're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing 'cause there's nothing left to lose

Thank you from the bottom of my heart
From head to toe, from the soul you ripped apart (Ooh)
I say: thank you, I say: thank you
Yeah, oh, thank you

We are the ones, the ones you left behind (Thank you)
Don't tell us how (Thank you), tell us how to live our lives (Hey, yeah)

We are the ones, the ones you left behind
Don't tell us how, tell us how to live our lives
Ten million strong, we're breaking all the rules
Thank you for nothing 'cause there's nothing left to lose

Yo, if you don't like what they tell you to do, don't do it
Huh, if you don't want to be who they want you to be, screw it
It's your world, it's your life and they ruined it
