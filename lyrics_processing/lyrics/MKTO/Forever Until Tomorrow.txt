Girl, I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Girl, I, I'm gonna hold you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow, baby, I got bills to pay
But since you're here today
And take my breath away
Girl, I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow

Yeah
You keep hanging with my whole crew
Swearing that you like me
Saying that you wanna be the one to wear my Nikes
Coming on strong, yeah, over the top
I would do anything to get you to stop
To the tic tok, but I can't knock
How you keep rocking your fingers in my pocket
Crazy how you wanna lock it down forever more
When all I wanna do is hit it, then you hit the door

But maybe, just maybe
I'm tired of tryna to fight it
Nobody, nobody
Can tell me that you shouldn't turn me on
When something feels so right, it can't be wrong
You might also like
Girl, I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Girl, I, I'm gonna hold you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow, baby, I got bills to pay
But since you're here today
And take my breath away
Girl, I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow

I ain't looking for a spouse yet
Looking for a house pet
You keep telling me to look at open houses
Baby, that ain't gonna turn me on
Quit trying to make lunch plans with my mom
Hold up with your hold up
Got a gun in my face, tryna set a wedding date
Baby, you keep tryna give me serious advice
When all I want from you is to get serious tonight

But maybe, just maybe
I'm tired of tryna to fight it
Nobody, nobody
Can tell me that you shouldn't turn me on
When something feels so right, it can't be wrong
Girl, I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Girl, I, I'm gonna hold you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow, baby, I got bills to pay
But since you're here today
And take my breath away
Girl, I, I'm gonna love you
Forever and ever and ever
Until tomorrow

1-2, 1-2-3-4
Why not tell you you're the one today?
Who knows what I'm gonna feel tomorrow?
Why not tell you you're the one today?
Who knows what I'm gonna feel tomorrow?
