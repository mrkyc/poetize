Now you let me down
You let me down when I needed you most
Down when I needed you most
Down when I needed you most
You let me down when I needed you most
Down when I needed you most
Down when I needed you most
Let me down everything is gone
Let me down, let me down everything is gone
Let me down, let me down everything is gone
So why am I standing here?

You gimme a track I'ma sail it
She don't hate games and she play 'em
When she trippin', tell her go take a little vacation
She runs back 'cause she know that my dick amazing
Money on my mind, she breakin' my concentration
Put the mask on, like Jason
Back in the whip paper chasin'
Watch Mary get cremated
I do this music free but they givin' me thousand dollar donations
Sleepwalkin', livin' my dream
Underground king, but I'm floatin' in the mainstream
Only 19, some people don't like me, fuck you
How can I say it nicely?
Didn't touch no Nikes bought these shoes stuntin'
They callin' me Spikey, he high
I might be only cause she let me down
His or her Porsche so when I don't drive you can drive me
You might also like
And I'ma tell you the truth, my heart is on the line
Got nothing to lose, I won't stop from loving you

You let me down when I needed you most
Down when I needed you most
Down when I needed you most
You let me down when I needed you most
Down when I needed you most
Down when I needed you most
Let me down everything is gone
Let me down, let me down everything is gone
Let me down, let me down everything is gone
So why am I standing here?

You tell me all your thoughts, I try my best to process
You comin' at me hot, I'm holdin' prayers and crosses
You scream, get mad, throw shit across the room
So I go to a different world, I let that side consume
My brain is insane
I'm falling so deep for a girl who gives two shits
Just go pack up and leave
Just throw it all away, yeah, pretend it never happened
Just fold it up real nicely, drop it into your crappin'
You let me down, now everything is gone, it's gone, yeah
You let me down, now everything is gone, it's gone, yeah
You let me down when I needed you the most
Your the worst host when I needed you the most
