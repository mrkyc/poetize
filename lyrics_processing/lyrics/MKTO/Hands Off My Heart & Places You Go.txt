Baby, you don't even know it, but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby I surrender it's too late for me to get your hands off, hands off
Get your hands off my heart
Tryna keep myself together, but I'm losing my mind
Every second that I think of you
Stealing every single piece of me like loving's a crime
It should be illegal what you do
There's only so much I can take
I tried so hard, I can't escape
Your body's always in my way
There you are
There you are
Baby you don't even know it, but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby I surrender it's too late for me to get your hands off, hands off
Get your hands off my heart
Get your hands off my heart
Man-eater
Damn schemer
Caught her on the bus with the band leader
Good girl gone bad, so deceiving
Hot when she's coming, cold when leaving
Tell you what you wanna hear, too good to be true
Always heard about the warning, never thought it'd be you
Take-taking a chance like I was the man
But she leaving with my heart in her hands
You might also likeThere's only so much I can take
I tried so hard, I can't escape
Your body's always in my way
There you are
There you are
Baby you don't even know it, but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby I surrender it's too late for me to get your hands off, hands off
Get your hands off my heart
You got me trying to break free
With your hands on my heart, got a hold of me
I don't know, is this really how it's supposed to be?
One minute, cold, then I'm feenin', Jodeci
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
You got me laying dead in the streets surrounded by chalk
I knew what you was doing from the start, but couldn't stop
Squeezing with your hands around my heart till it pops (pop)
Take your hands off, hands off, off me
Take your hands off, hands off, off me
Take your hands off, hands off, off me
Take 'em off me
Take 'em off me
Baby you don't even know it, but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby I surrender it's too late for me to get your hands off, hands off
Get your hands off my heart


You can fall, but baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh you might not like the places you go
Caught you by surprise
(Birthday)
Caught you and you lied
(The worst way)
Now there's no disguise
(You're thirsty)
Every time we say goodbye
(No mercy)
In the Murci
Whiplash as I fly right past you, see you later
And what you can't see
Is that me leaving you, is doing you a favor
Cause I can't be
Trusted, my words only cut like a razor
Trusted, my words disappear like a vapor
I'm a real heartbreaker
You can fall, but baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh you might not like the places you go
Tell me what you'd like
(Blank stare)
What you wouldn't like
(Don't care)
Welcome to my
(Nightmare)
You should run and hide
(I don't play fair)
You wanna play here?
I make the rules when I want, then I break them
Baby, stay clear
As soon as I'm done, then I'm out and I blaze one
We could blow beer
You start up loving me, later, you hate it
It's not my fault that you fell for me baby
When I played you "Wasted"
You can fall, but baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh you might not like the places you go
