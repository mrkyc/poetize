We broke down trying to leave town
Driving down the roads of change
We were born to run, Cali here we come
State from nowhere, USA
Say goodbye to white picket fences
Say hello to palm trees and Benzes
They say you have to fall to have it all
(Mmm...)
Yeah, well we don't want two kids and a wife
I don't want a job I just want a life
They say the underdogs rise
In my mind you'll fall
This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
'Cuz Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So tell me whatever happened to the American dream
I know a girl I met her last night
She was fresh off the plane
She whispered in my ear
"Baby come near I'll do anything to make a name"

I don't wanna hurt you but he does
I just wanna give you some real advice
(Listen baby, mmm)
Look, never take candy from a stranger
And keep your eyes open for danger
'Cuz this right here is the twisted paradise
This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
'Cuz Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So tell me whatever happened to the American dream
Na na na This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
'Cuz Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So tell me whatever happened to the American dream
This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
So baby, let's live and die before we're getting old
You know that nothing is the way it used to be
So tell me whatever happened to the American dream
