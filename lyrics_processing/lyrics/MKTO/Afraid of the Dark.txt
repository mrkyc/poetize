(It's going down)
It's going down

We go together like fire and dynamite when it blows
Look out, look out below
When we touch, the world explodes
Every time you're near me I get hella overheated
Try to live without you but your body heat, I need it
Ooh wee, darling, believe that I'll never let you go

Even if you're afraid of the dark
Let's be dangerous, surrender your heart

All anybody needs is one light
I'll be anything that you like
Call me if you need it tonight
When you are afraid of the dark
All anybody needs is one light
I'll be anything that you like
Call me if you need it tonight
When you are afraid of the dark
You might also like
I'll lift you up when you need
Won't let no one hold you down
I'll be the air that you breathe
No, I'll never let you drown
I can keep you warmer when your nights are getting colder
Even when you feel like your entire world is over
Oh my, you get me high and we'll never touch the ground

Even if you're afraid of the dark
Let's be dangerous, surrender your heart

All anybody needs is one light
I'll be anything that you like
Call me if you need it tonight
When you are afraid of the dark
All anybody needs is one light
I'll be anything that you like
Call me if you need it tonight
When you are afraid of the dark

I know you're not scared to love
But of not being loved back
Not afraid of heights
But scared of falling off
Always on the run
Without ever tryna look back
Sleeping with the lights on
Wish you could turn 'em off
I'll be your knight in shining armor
Every night I'll fight the monsters
When you're dreaming
Watching the sky for flying saucers
Hold you closer, rock you
Malcolm to the rescue
I'm your Superman and Batman
If they ever try to get you
Even if you're afraid of the dark
Let's be dangerous, surrender your heart

All anybody needs is one light
I'll be anything that you like
Call me if you need it tonight
When you are afraid of the dark
All anybody needs is one light
I'll be anything that you like
Call me if you need it tonight
