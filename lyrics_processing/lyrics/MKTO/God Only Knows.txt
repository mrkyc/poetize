I've always said I could never fall because I love 'em all, mmm
My heart don't race when they try to call because I love 'em all
But she got me stuttering, like w-w-what can I do because I can't control it
She got me hovering above the ground and I don't know what to do

God only knows how much I need you
I could explode if I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes, 5-4-3-2
'Cause you're the one, I guess I'm done, that's how it goes
Where will I be without you? Yeah, God only knows

There ain't a crime I wouldn't do for you, let's make our getaway, mmm
These diamonds shine, but not as bright as you, I'll throw them all away
I'm here surrendering and I give up, throwing my hands around you
Can't remember when I fell like the way I fell for you

God only knows how much I need you
I could explode if I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes, 5-4-3-2
'Cause you're the one, I guess I'm done, that's how it goes
Where will I be without you? Yeah, God only knows

God only knows (Baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where will I be without you?
Yeah, God only knows

When you touch me (Damn, girl) with your body
And all that I can think is how to lose our clothes
What's next? (What's next?<!--?i-->) God only knows
God only knows, God only knows (C'mon), ooh
(They not ready, baby!)

God only knows, how much I need you
I could explode if I can't breathe you
I'm on the ropes like 5-4-3-2
'Cause you're the one, I guess I'm done, that's how it goes
Where will I be without you? Yeah, God only knows

Yeah, God only knows
Where will I be without you?
