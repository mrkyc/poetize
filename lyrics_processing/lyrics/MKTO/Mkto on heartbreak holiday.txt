And I'm just getting sober
And it feels like I'm freezing in the California sun
Christmas almost killed me
New Year's cold as Philly
April Fool's I thought you were the one
Now I'm holding on, for dear life
Skating through it on thin ice
And it just sucks how much I'm missing you
Yea
(Baby I hate) I freaking hate
(Valentines Day) Valentines Day
(I'm feeling this pain) It cuts like a blade when I think about you
(But what can I say?) It's just so late
(We're playing this game) It's all a charade
A heartbreak holiday here without you
Woah oh oh oh
Oh I've been deleting every trace
Of when we were together
But ever since I kissed you I just can't get out the taste
So I ate your box of chocolates
Cause I knew you didn't want it
The way that I still want you, what a waste
Now I'm holding on, for dear life
Skating through it on thin ice
And it just sucks how much I'm missing you
I'm just missing you
(Baby I hate) I freaking hate
(Valentines Day) Valentines Day
(I'm feeling this pain) It cuts like a blade when I think about you
(But what can I say?) It's just so late
(We're playing this game) It's all a charade
A heartbreak holiday here without you
Woah oh oh oh
It's a heartbreak holiday
With you are million miles away (too far)
Another guy, another place
I'm stuck without you
I'm on a heartbreak holiday, yeah, Hotel California
You in NYC wishin' I was there up on ya
Baby you're so right but you left 'cause I wronged ya
I'm wishing I could change the way I want ya
But you're long gone so
Woah oh oh oh
(When I think about you)
(Baby I hate) I freaking hate
(Valentines Day) Valentines Day
(I'm feeling this pain) It cuts like a blade when I think about you
(But what can I say?) It's just so late
(We're playing this game) It's all a charade
(It's all a game) A heartbreak holiday here without you
You know I'm thinking about you
You know I'm thinking about you
You know I'm thinking about you
Woah oh oh oh
