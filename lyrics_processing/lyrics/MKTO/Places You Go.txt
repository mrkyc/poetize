You can follow baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh you might not like the places you go

Got you by surprise
(Burn babe)
Caught you in your lies
(The worst way)
Now there's no disguise
(You're thirsty)
Every time I say goodbye
(No mercy)
I'm in the Merci
Whiplashes, I'll fly right past you, see you later
And what you can't see
Is that me leaving you, is doing you a favor?
Cause I can't be
Trust that my words only cut like a razor
Trust that my words, it's okay like a vapor
I'm a real heartbreaker
You might also like
You can follow baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh you might not like the places you go

Tell me what you'd like
(Blank stare)
Tell me what you want in life
(No care)
Welcome to my (nightmare)
You should run and hide
(I don't play fair)
You wanna play here?
Well I make the rules and I weren't gonna break them
Baby stay clear
As soon as I'm done and I'm out and I blaze one
We could blow beer
You stood up loving me, later you hater
It's not my fault that you fell for me baby
When I played you wasted
You can follow baby
Don't get too close
Or you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh you might not like the places you go
