Thank God winter's almost done
And I'm just getting sober
And it feels like I'm freezing in the California sun
Christmas almost killed me
New Year's cold as Philly
April Fool's I thought you were the one

Now I'm holding on, for dear life
Skating through it on thin ice
And it just sucks how much I'm missing you
Yeah

(Baby I hate)
I freaking hate
(Valentine's Day)
Valentine's Day
(I'm feeling this pain)
It cuts like a blade when I think about you
(What can I say?)
It's just so late
(We're playing this game)
It's all a charade
A heartbreak holiday here without you
You might also like
Oh woah oh oh oh
(Heartbreak)
A heartbreak holiday
(Heartbreak)

Oh, I've been deleting every trace
Of when we were together
But ever since I kissed you
I just can't get out the taste
So I ate your box of chocolates
'Cause I knew you didn't want it
The way that I still want you, what a waste

Now I'm holding on, for dear life
Skating through it but on thin ice
And it just sucks how much I'm missing you
I'm just missing you

(Baby I hate)
I freaking hate
(Valentine's Day)
Valentine's Day
(I'm feeling this pain)
It cuts like a blade when I think about you
(What can I say?)
It's just so late
(We're playing this game)
It's all a charade
A heartbreak holiday here without you
Oh woah oh oh oh
(Heartbreak)
A heartbreak holiday
(Heartbreak)

Well it's a heartbreak holiday
With you a million miles away (too far)
Another guy, another place
Stuck without you

I'm on a heartbreak holiday, yeah, Hotel California
You in NYC wishin' I was there up on ya
Baby you're so right but you left 'cause I wronged ya
I'm wishing I could change the way I want ya
But you're long gone

Oh woah oh oh oh
Oh woah oh oh oh
(Damn)
Oh woah oh oh oh
(When I think about you)
(Baby I hate)
I freaking hate
(Valentine's Day)
Valentine's Day
(I'm feeling this pain)
It cuts like a blade when I think about you
(What can I say?)
It's just so late
(We're playing this game)
It's all a charade
(It's all a game)
A heartbreak holiday here without you

Oh woah oh oh oh
(Heartbreak)
It's a heartbreak holiday
I'm thinking about you
(I'm thinking about you)
I'm thinking about you
(I'm thinking about you)
Woah oh oh oh
(Heartbreak)
(Heartbreak holiday)
(Heartbreak)
(Heartbreak)
Woah oh oh oh
