No more second chances, no more plastic lies
No more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye, oh

You only live once, no second chances
She says I go from The Hulk to Mr. Romantic
They calling me singing
I've been Ghost and I pull up in the Phantom
I'm 'bout to get the money moving
I can't sit still, I'ma leave you standing

Everything we had is all gone
Not one more chance, I moved on
I'm doing me, so you'd do you
You'd do you

'Cause this is my only life
So I've got to let you go
You should've been only mine
So I'm walking out your door

Singing no more second chances
No more plastic lies
No more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye

She only want my Ricotta, ace of spades and vodka
She trying to be my flame like Waka Flocka, what the focka
GPS in my phone, the bug in the house like she a stalker
She trying to lock me down with
A pie like she's some Betty Crocker

No more games, no old news
Putting new words to an old tune
Just move out the parts where I loved you
I loved you yea

Cause this is my only life
So I've got to let you go
You should've been only mine
So I'm walking out your door

Singing no more second chances
No more plastic lies
No more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye

Uh, trying to say I'm crazy, but it's you that chased me
Ain't no black and white, there's crazy different shades of shady
Remember when I caught your fingers creepin' 'round me
Texting her at midnight, boy you just a phony, ooh
And I looked right past it, like it was old news
And I told myself, why should I doubt you?
About to turn the tables on you
I'm 'bout to turn the tables on you
Singing no more second chances
No more plastic lies
No more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye, bye, bye, bye

Baby, please don't go
Is there anything I can say?
No no no no no, baby, please don't go
Yea, I'm begging you, say goodbye
So many years that I tried
But might've changed my mind
No more giving me reasons to make me have to goodbye bye bye
