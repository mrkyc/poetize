I got one foot out the door
One foot out the door
I think she said her name but I was wasted
I don't care anymore
One foot out the door
(Bridge)
Night after night, day after day
Jack and coke, smoking on the fire escape
Is it too soon? Or is it too late?
()
Am I crazy to think that I could be in love?
When it all ends up
It all ends up wasted
I'd give you my heart but I'd just fuck it up
And we'd end up, we'd end up wasted
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Trying to numb the pain away
I know how to leave but not to stay
I wonder if I will ever find
Someone to fill me up inside
Someone to kiss my fears away
If I believed in God I'd pray
To God I'd pray

And we'd end up, we'd end up wasted
