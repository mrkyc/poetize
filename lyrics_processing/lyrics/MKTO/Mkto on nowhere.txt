Well done, head, well done
She keeps me fed, breast and some legs
Well done, yeah, well done
You go to work all day and I work my Xbox
You wear your high heels and I'm high scoring in my socks
You know the right time to go buy me a new watch
You never asked for a key so I never had to change the locks
You know what I like, so gimme what I want and
Girl I never go nowhere
Gimme love at night and love in the morning
And girl I'll never go nowhere
I know I may be asking for much
But baby I don't really care
I know I maybe sound a bit nuts
But girl I wouldn't go nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere (x4)
Girl I'll never go nowhere
Under the sheets, 10,000 thread
Go head, spending you bread
You can't be beat, you're such a 10
Baking, brownies, naked
You understand that I got other girls to call
You never trip because I let you get involved
Take your company jet to that company island, getaway
Spending company money, drinking company champagne

Girl I never go nowhere
Gimme love at night and love in the morning
And girl I'll never go nowhere
I know I may be asking for much
But baby I don't really care
I know I maybe sound a bit nuts
But girl I wouldn't go nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere (x4)
Girl I'll never go nowhere
You know what I want, you know
You know what I like
I would never stray
At the end of the day you gone do me right
Rap:
Malcolm in the Middle what?
Your legs
Throw a party for me everyday like, squallay (?)
Charging up the cards like a bull say ole
I pay? No way
She pay? Ok
You know what I like, so gimme what I want and
Girl I never go nowhere
Gimme love at night and love in the morning
And girl I'll never go nowhere
I know I may be asking for much
But baby I don't really care
I know I maybe sound a bit nuts
But girl I wouldn't go nowhere
