Under your tongue like it's your bubble gum
You're blowing bubbles 'til the taste is gone
You're coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night
Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your bubble gum
Just spit me out when it comes more than fun
'Cause I'm coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night
Conversation is violent
Baby you're too digital
8-bit dated physical
But keep me under your ceiling
'Cause your concrete is cheapening
Crumbling like Greece on me, oh no
Don't take this swing for more than it is
It's one night, one night, one night
Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your bubble gum
You're blowing bubbles 'til the taste is gone
You're coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night
Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your bubble gum
Just spit me out when it comes more than fun
'Cause I'm coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night
You might also likeAnd now I'll pull you in close
It's a sweet and sour high
When you promise not to try
You've a promise that I lie
We can drink a punch for this one last time
Just one more last time
Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your bubble gum
You're blowing bubbles 'til the taste is gone
You're coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night
Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your bubble gum
Just spit me out when it comes more than fun
'Cause I'm coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
Night, night, night x3
