Without you
With the light on
'Cause I have to
Do as shadows
Surround you
Do you think of me
Think, think of me?
When the night hits
When you're sleepin'
Do you miss me
When you're dreamin'
'Cause I'm tossin'
And I'm lost in
What you did to me
Did, did to me
When I tried to tell you everything
You said you don't believe me anyway
Open up your eyes and look above
And if the stars say I'm lying
There's nothing really left to wish on
And nothing's gonna bring you back anymore
And if your heart still denies me
Then it doesn't really count, what I do
'Cause the stars won't shine without you
Whoahhh~
You might also likeFeel the places
With your fingers
See the secrets
With your whispers
Used to be so
Much better
Had to let it go
But I can't let you go
If the statue
Of the city
Oh the struggle wasn't easy
Be the story, be the history
But you wanna see
That you thought it would be
Now I don't believe we're meant to be
But I every voice I hear is telling me
To make you open up your eyes and look above
And if the stars say I'm lying
There's nothing really left to wish on
And nothing's gonna bring you back anymore
And if your heart still denies me
Then it doesn't really count what I do
'Cause the stars won't shine without you
Whoahhh~
If the rain falls around me
It's never gonna change at all Oh
Guess we're gonna change it all
If the rain falls around me
It's never gonna change at all
And that's we're gonna change it all
And if the stars say I'm lying
There's nothing really left to wish on
And nothing's gonna bring you back anymore
And if your heart still denies me
Then it doesn't really count what I do
Cause the stars won't shine without you
Whoahh~
I wanna be your last first kiss
Your star's constipated twist
Wanna wake up whenever you are
Wanna wake up wherever you are
Don't wanna stay awake something ick
After everything, everything, everything, everything!
Don't wanna stop
Eh
