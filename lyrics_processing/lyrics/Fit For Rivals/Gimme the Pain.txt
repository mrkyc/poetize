Like a cigarette burning on the skin of your inner thigh
I just wanna feel like you and I are one
So let it go
You got a heart like a stone baby it's easy to see
I said just give me an ounce but there was nothing to squeeze
I like when you bite but it hurts when it bleeds
So come on baby, let's get dirty, give it to me
I wanna trace your flesh all the way till I'm inside
There is a violence in my heart in my blood that I can't hide
I just wanna feel like you and I are one
Just let me know
You got a heart like a stone baby it's easy to see
I said just give me an ounce but there was nothing to squeeze
I like when you bite but it hurts when it bleeds
So come on baby, let's get dirty, give it to me
I know that look when I see it in your eyes
The lights are on but there is no one inside
It seems like every time we touch I break like a wave
So come on baby, let's get dirty, give me the pain
Aa ah
