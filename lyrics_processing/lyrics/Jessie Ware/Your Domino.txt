What can I say?
What can I do?
If it's alright, I'd like to fall in front of you
If there's a fate, tell me it's you
It's black and white, I don't know why I'm so confused

Left to my imagination
It's a long way down

You give me a touch, I'm falling like a domino
I find it impossible to take it slow
Blow me a kiss, give me a look so powerful
Do you know I, oh, I want to be your domino
I want to be your domino
I want to be your domino

I'm counting the roses all in a row
All your apologies wrapped up in fancy bows
But tell me again what I already know
I can't stand it when we're dancing on tiptoes

Left to my imagination
It's a long way down
