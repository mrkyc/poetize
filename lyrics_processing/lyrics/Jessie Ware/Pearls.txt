Excuse me, I don't know about you
But I think it's time to
Shake it till the pearls fall

I'm so nine to five, I'm a lady
I'm a lover, a freak and a mother
Walking on the line, it's my human nature
I crave a little danger

I know you wanna (Ooh)
Go to the moon (Ooh)
But if you don't go, you'll never get there, oh
I know you wanna (Ooh)
Go to the moon (Ooh)
Won't you take a hold of me? (Mhm, uh-huh, uh-huh)

Shake it till the pearls fall off
Let it go, let me dance
And shake it till the pearls get lost
Lost in romance, let's just dance
And shake it till the pearls fall off
