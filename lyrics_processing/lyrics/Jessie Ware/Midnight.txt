You're special, yours truly
You pull me deep into my deepest desires
Can you meet me in the midnight?
Going in because I know you, you know me
When I'm fadin', you're the only one who inspires
Can you meet me in the midnight?

Maybe I love you
Maybe I want to
Maybe I need you
Ooh, yeah (Maybe I love you)
Don't let me fall through (Don't let me fall through)
Now that I need you
I feel his magic is never gonna fade
I ain't got nothing to say

But you're precious, I'm scheming
Keep dreaming 'bout a world where we are an item
Can I miss you in the daylight?
Whenever you're around, I'm lifted, so lifted (Oh, yeah)
This moment is made for you and I to go higher (Higher, higher, higher)
Can you meet me in the midnight?
