It's gonna take two, two hearts
Two hours, two more
I'm telling you that these two lips
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)

In and out of delirious
Everything is so mysterious with you
Back and forth to the beat of us
Ring alarms 'cause we're heating up this room

Baby, when you touch my body
Everything feels so perfect
Hurry up 'cause I'm worth it
(I'm worth it, you're worth it)
If you want me, just want me
Show me you're made of magic
Send a signal to the stars and tell them where we are is where we wanna be

(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)

All alone in a fantasy
That's the place you don't have to be with me
Close your eyes, keep them close to me
Satisfy my desires and needs

Baby, when you touch my body (Ah)
Everything feels so perfect (Ah)
Hurry up 'cause I'm worth it (Ah)
(I'm worth it, you're worth it)
If you want me, just want me
Show me you're made of magic
Send a signal to the stars and tell them where we are is where we wanna be

It's gonna take two, two hearts
Two hours, two more
I'm telling you that these two lips
Could do so much more

(These two lips can do so much more) They could do so much more
(These two lips could do so much more) So much more
(These two lips could do so much more) So much more
(These two lips can do so much more)
These lips could turn milk to gold
These lips can soothe body and soul
These lips will take you places that you never thought you'd go
These lips are wanted in a hundred countries, maybe more
These lips can testify (Testify!), mystify (Mystify!)
And if they ever let you down, they will be justified (Ooh!)
These lips are satisfaction, they set off chain reactions
Send a signal to the stars and tell them where we are is where we wanna be

It's gonna take two, two hearts
Two hours (Two hours), two more
And I'm telling you that these two lips
Can do so much more

So much more (Ah)
So much more (How much? How much?)
So much more (Ah)
These two lips can do so much more (Ah)
These two lips can do so much more
These two lips can do so much more
These two lips can do so much, so much more

(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)
