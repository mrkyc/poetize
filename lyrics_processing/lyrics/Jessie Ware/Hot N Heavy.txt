Where did you come from?
How do you move like that?
I've never seen someone so free
Tell me your name
You are to die for
If this is our last night
Let's make it count
Let's give this crowd something to talk about

Show me all the ways to strike the match
Once you give it up, don't take it back
Show me all the ways to get to know ya
I just wanna be your dream controller
Show me all the ways to strike the match

You get me hot and heavy
That something in your eyes
I'm willing and I'm ready
To set my heart on fire
You get me hot and heavy
You get me hot and heavy
You make me feel like ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah
You get me hot and heavy
That something in your eyes
I'm willing and I'm ready
To set my heart on fire
You get me hot and heavy
You get me hot and heavy
You make me feel like ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah
