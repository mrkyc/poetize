I get a little bit of entertainment in your arms
I'll take you to the rooftop and the basement
What do you want?

Every time I get a little bit of an inclination
You can throw me to the shock of a new sensation (Shock me! Again and again and again and a-ooh!)
Tell me where you're at so we could ride to a new location
(Is it bad? Bad in a new dimension!
Again and again and again and a-ooh!)

You can throw me to the shock of a new sensation (Shock me! Again and again and again and a-ooh!)
Everybody gets a little modest and shy sometimes
Just remember, pleasure is a right!

I got a feeling I can't escape (That! Feels good!)
I got a feeling that cannot wait
Shakin' a bottle of pink champagne (That! Feels good!)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake!
I gotta something I can't describe (That! Feels good!)
I gotta something to get you high
Sugar 'n' salt it, lick that lime (Do it again)
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick that, get in line (Do it again)
