You won't see me crying
Crying over you
And you don't see me falling
Even baby when I'm falling for two
Sometimes it's hard to see you're not watching me
When I want you to
And don't you know I'm dying
Just to spend a little more time with you

Baby I'm yours, all of the time
I know that you'll never see

I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
Want to give you all my love when I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
Just can't give you up
I don't wanna sleep, I don't wanna leave, I don't want a way out
I just wanna feel every little beat when I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
Thinking 'bout you

I only wanna give you love
I only wanna sing your sound
I don't wanna give this up
I don't wanna let you down

Baby I'm yours, all the time, all the time
I know that you'll never see

I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
Want to give you all my love when I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
Just can't give you up
I don't wanna sleep, I don't wanna leave, I don't want a way out
I just wanna feel every little beat when I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
Thinking 'bout you

Maybe I get lost sometimes
You're the only thing on my mind
And baby, you don't see

When I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
Want to give you all my love when I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
Just can't give you up, 'cause
I don't wanna sleep, I don't wanna leave, I don't want a way out
I just wanna feel every little beat when I'm thinking 'bout you (thinking 'bout you)
