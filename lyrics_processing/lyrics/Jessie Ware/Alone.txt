Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh

Take the weight off my shoulders
Say, I won't make the same mistakes when we're older
'Cause with every step you take I'm getting colder
So come a little closer, just come a little closer

I don't want somebody else to call my name
No, I don't want somebody else when you could just say

Say that you're the one who's taking me home
'Cause I want you on my skin and my bones
Knocking me off my feet
Just say I'm the one that you need, oh, please
Say that you're the one who's taking me home
So I can get you alone

Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh

Just wanna talk a little longer
So, baby, don't you wanna stay a little later?
'Cause I could watch you watch me forever
'Cause I know you better
And you know I never
