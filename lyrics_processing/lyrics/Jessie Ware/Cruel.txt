If I told you what you said before
Would you be just as certain what's going on?
'Cause actions, actions speak louder than the words you sow (And you ought to know)
I've been wonderin' why I'm holdin', still holdin' on

Do us both a favour (Tonight)
If you want to do the real thing (Make it right)
You need to make your mind up (Just try)
Do you feel we've reached the end of the line?

Never knew our love could be so cruel
(Be so cruel, be so cruel to me)
It's not just what you say, it's what you do
(What you do, what you do to me)
Never knew our love could be so cruel
(Be so cruel, be so cruel to me)
It's not just what you say, it's what you do
(What you do, what you do to me)

Your actions (Actions)
They speak louder than the words you sow
And you ought to know
Have you been wonderin' why I'm holdin', still holdin' on?
