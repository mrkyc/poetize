Oh ohohoh
Oh ohohoh

I was dreaming of war; you saw that I wouldn't die
Was dreaming of shores that my ship would find
I was dreaming because it made me feel so alive
Was dreaming it all from my bed last night

You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, we're staying young, yeah
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever

This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
You might also like
I was feeling a storm, but it wasn't outside
Was feeling a force; I'm electrified
I was feeling my heart; there was thunder inside
Was feeling it all from my bed last night

You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, we're staying young, yeah
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever

This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever

All the things that I don't know
All the dreams that I've been shown
All the ways that it could end tonight
Close your eyes
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
We're gonna live, we're gonna live forever
