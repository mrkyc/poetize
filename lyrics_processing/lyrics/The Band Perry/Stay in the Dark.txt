Here we are in this moment
Eyes closed
Where we going?
Here I am with my arms wide open
Go 'head, close the curtains
I don't care where we'll end up
Right now, let's be in love
Here I am with my heart wide open
Go 'head, close the curtains

Lately, things been getting so crazy
I'm feeling like my heart hates me
It's blazing

I just wanna stay in the dark (ooh, ooh)
Turn off all the lights
Come hold me tight
Where we going?
I just wanna stay in the dark (ooh, ooh)
Turn off all the lights
Come hold me tight
And get me going
I just wanna stay in the dark
