You are the best one yet, you are the best one yet
You are the best one yet, you are the best one yet

I still can't fall asleep 'cause you're stuck in my brain
So many fish up in the sea, but I'm stuck on your brain
'Cause you're the light up in the hall and I can't sleep without you
So many people I would call
 say I won't live without you, without you

And I know they'll say there's so much waiting for me up ahead
But I don't care, you are the best one yet

Of all the hearts, of all the hearts
Of all the hands I've held in the dark
Of all the things I will regret
Yes, yes, you are the best one yet
Of all the nights, of all the nights
Of all the  light
Of all the beats I've felt in my chest
Yes, yes, you are the best one yet

A hundred words that I can write, but I'm stuck on your name
A hundred ways that I could fly, but I'm stuck on your plane
 dreams I haven't had, 
I should think of other things, but it's only your body, your body
You might also like
And I know they'll say there's so much waiting for me up ahead
But I don't care, you are the best one yet

Of all the hearts, of all the hearts
Of all the hands I've held in the dark
Of all the things I will regret
Yes, yes, you are the best one yet
Of all the nights, of all the nights
Of all the  light
Of all the beats I've felt in my chest
Yes, yes, you are the best one yet

Take my hand, I don't care if they believe
No more plans 'cause nothing's guaranteed

Of all the hearts, of all the hearts
Of all the hands I've held in the dark
Of all the things I will regret
Yes, yes, you are the best one yet
Of all the nights, of all the nights
Of all the  light
Of all the beats I've felt in my chest
