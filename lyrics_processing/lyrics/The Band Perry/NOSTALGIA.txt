Nostalgia confuses the things I want, yeah
It's like a broke piece of my armor, yeah
Open all the time, time, time, time
And time, you stopped it there on a dime
When I'm butchered you like a punchline
I do it all the time, time, time, time

My memories, they always get the best of me
Can I erase my history?
Go back in time, time, time

Nostalgia, come back, I still want you bad
Been thinking 'bout our old thing
All the time, time, time, time
Nostalgia, I should pick up my phone and just stalk ya
It's all just so confusing
All the time, time, time, time

Nausea when I think of the pain I caused ya
When I bit the hand it hurt me like Jaws, yeah
It eats me up inside, side, side, side
You might also like
New memories, they only get what's left of me
'Cause now it's my reality
Hits me all the time, time, time

Nostalgia, come back, I still want you bad
Been thinking 'bout our old thing
All the time, time, time, time
Nostalgia, I should pick up my phone and just stalk ya
It's all just so confusing
All the time, time, time, time

I'm only human, I'm not a God
I'm only human, I never forgot
You're only human, you're not a God
Can you forgive me? I never forgot
Amnesia, don't forget I don't need ya
You're my favorite creature
For all time, time, time

Nostalgia, come back, I still want you bad
Been thinking 'bout our old thing
All the time, time, time, time
Nostalgia, I should pick up my phone and just stalk ya
It's all just so confusing
All the time, time, time, time
Nostalgia, come back, I still want you bad
Been thinking 'bout our old thing
All the time, time, time, time
Nostalgia, I should pick up my phone and just stalk ya
It's all just so confusing
