Maybe I could stick my feet in a wishing well
Pocket full of pennies; maybe I could get some help
I got a hole in my heart like the holes in my jeans
I try to patch it up with anything and everything

But it ain't working
So why do we believe
In every little thing
That rips us at the seams?

Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones
Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones, baby
'Cause there's no such thing as chance
Gotta play what's in your hands
Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones

Maybe I could bet my love on a four leaf clover
The winter house, then you know it's over
It's cold in my soul like it's cold outside
Cross my heart and hope to find the love that lasts a lifetime

But I ain't there yet
So why do we keep
Giving hearts away
To things that only break?

Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones
Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones, baby
'Cause there's no such thing as chance
Gotta play what's in your hands
Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones

Ain't gonna live my life by the roll of the dice, no
Ain't gonna live my life by the roll of the dice
So why do we believe in every little thing that rips us at the seams?

Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones
Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones, baby
'Cause there's no such thing as chance
Gotta play what's in your hands
Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones
Whoa-oh, we're the lucky ones
We're the lucky ones, baby
'Cause there's no such thing as chance
Ya gotta play what's in your hands
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no
'Cause there's no such thing as chance
You gotta play what's in your hands
Whoa, whoa, no, no
Yeah, baby
Gotta play what's in your hands
Hey-ya, little baby
So why, so why, so why do we believe
I said no, no, no
So why, so why, so why do we believe little, baby?
We're the lucky ones little, baby
