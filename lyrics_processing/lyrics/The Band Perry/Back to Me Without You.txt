I wanna wake where I was born and breathe the old air in
I need a haunt from a ghost that I knew way back then
Oh, I hope they left the light on
I want someone who knows me, just to say my name
To tell me though things are different now, somehow I'm still the same
Oh, I can almost hear them calling

I don't know if I'll be back again
Turns out, they were right again
(Get back to what you know, get back to what you do)
You gotta get back to me, ooh
If it's true, home is where the heart is
I guess now I'm homeless
(Get back to what you know, get back to what you do)
Gotta get back to me without you

For two years I've lived my life way out on a limb
I put my faith in you not knowing you would break in the end
Oh, I hate feeling fallen

I don't know if I'll be back again
Turns out, they were right again
(Get back to what you know, get back to what you do)
You gotta get back to me, ooh
If it's true, home is where the heart is
I guess now I'm homeless
(Get back to what you know, get back to what you do)
Gotta get back to me without you

Whoa
Whoa

I added rain to your ocean
What did it do, it meant nothing to you
You made grief my chief emotion
Why'd you have to do what you thought you had to do?

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Get back to what you know

I don't know if I'll be back again
Turns out, they were right again
(Get back to what you know, get back to what you do)
You gotta get back to me, ooh
If it's true, home is where the heart is
I guess now I'm homeless
(Get back to what you know, get back to what you do)
Gotta get back to me without you
The slow death of a slow dance
The tailspin of a romance
