He was sweet as cotton candy at a county fair
Well, he's a cold drink of water with butterscotch hair
He swore that he loved me
Well, I guess he probably did
'Cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
I saw my name next to his

A new tattoo, stinging like a hornet
Two little hearts like a big red warning
I wasn't looking for a permanent thing
First comes the ink, then comes the ring
Burn, burn baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should've slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me
So now it's 0 to 60
And if you ever miss me, I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry, I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a double heart

Well, he's a tough broncing buster
I bet he sleeps in his boots
Well, he tried to throw a rope around me right out of the shoot, yeah
He swore that he loved me
Well, I reckon he probably did
'Cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
I thought here we go again
You might also like
A new tattoo burning like a brand
Two little hearts on my rodeo man
I wasn't looking for a permanent thing
First comes the ink, then comes the ring
Burn burn baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should've slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me
Well, now it's 0 to 60
And if you ever miss me, I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry, I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a double heart

I'm a free bird
A new tattoo whistling Dixie
Two little hearts ain't gonna get me
I'm not looking for a permanent thing
So don't you put ink 'til I take the ring

Burn burn baby
I bet we could've made a bunch of sweet memories
You should have slowed down mister
Moving like a twister's just a little fast for me
Well, now it's 0 to 60
And if you ever miss me, I'm right there on your arm
Don't you cry, I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a, skid marks and a
Skid marks and a double heart
Well, I'm a free bird
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
