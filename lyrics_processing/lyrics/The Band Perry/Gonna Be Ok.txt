Hey, yesterday is the day you died
Could it be you just stopped feeling alive?
Trouble's on your shoulders for so long
You'll be stronger when the moment's gone
You're looking for a better day
The darkest hour finds the brightest grace
So today, I know you'll come to realize
Come to realize that...

Hey, everything is gonna be ok, may God kiss your weary face
Everything is gonna be alright; let peace be yours tonight
Rest and know you're saved, don't be afraid, oh
Everything is gonna be ok
Be ok

I see the storm clouds in your eyes
Don't be afraid to taste the tears you cry
Ring the good out of the bad
There's an awful lot of beauty in that
You're looking for a hand to hold
You gotta stumble to stand up on your own, oh
My fingertips within your grip
Reach a little further then
You might also like
Hey, everything is gonna be ok, may God kiss your weary face
Everything is gonna be alright; let peace be yours tonight
Rest and know you're saved, don't be afraid, oh
Everything is gonna be ok

Mercy speaks in disguise
A voice too rough to recognize
Brings you back to life and

Hey, everything is gonna be ok
May God kiss your weary face
Everything is gonna be alright; let peace be yours tonight
Rest, and know you're saved, don't be afraid, oh
Everything is gonna be ok
Be ok
(Everything) is gonna be ok
I said reach a little further, reach a little further, and say
(Everything) is gonna be ok
So come on back to life, it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok
You'll see a brighter day, it's gonna be ok
It's gonna be ok, is gonna be ok
