Why didn't you show me?
Why didn't you let me know?
Why didn't you hold me?
Why can't you let me go?

There's a heart ache in New York City
Keeping you awake all night long
Something you forgot to say to make me stay
If I was the best you never had
Why didn't you show me?
Why didn't you let me know?
Why didn't you hold me? Yeah
Why can't you let me go?

Once upon a time
Once upon a time
You wanna go back to the night we left behind
Well, maybe I don't know much about nothing, but I know a little bit about loving
There's just no going back to once upon a time

You could never be more in love with me
I saw it in your eyes on that winter night
But I never, never, never felt so cold
You hid your heart
What I don't know can't keep me warm
So, why didn't ya show me?
Why didn't you let me know?
Why didn't you hold me, hold me?
Why can't you let me go?

Once upon a time
Once upon a time
You wanna go back to the night we left behind
Well, maybe I don't know much about nothing, but I know a little bit about loving
There's just no going back to once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
I could have, I could have blown your mind


Once upon a time
Once upon a time
I don't wanna go back to the night we left behind
Well, baby
I don't know much about nothing, but I know a little bit about loving
There's just no going back to once upon a time
Once upon a time
I don't wanna go back
Don't wanna go back
Don't wanna go back
'Cause, baby
I don't know much about nothing, but I know a little bit about loving
There's just no going back to once upon a time
