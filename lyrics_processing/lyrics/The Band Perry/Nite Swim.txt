Night swim

New friends, cold black ocean
Sun down, fingers frozen
You're a new wave, new emotion
Not quite lovers, but I'm so open for you
Can't stay, see you later
Slow fade, days like vapor
I'm a sad bitch, end of summer
End of another, my tears runneth over

Cherry fly, cherry fly, short pretty life
Nothing wrong, nothing wrong, go if you like
50 days, 50 days, one final night
Can you stay? Can you stay? Say that you might

Night swimming, darkness twisting
Lights out, just keep clinging to me
Won't drown, just keep kicking with me
What a feeling, night swimming
Yeah

LA, mistake maker
Biscayne, pastel papers
I got new plans, future waters
Future planets, if you want 'em
You got big cake, still don't matter
Full case, you never been sadder
Like a sad bitch, I think you'd rather
Not get shattered, so you scatter

And you cruise around, cruise around, ride in the night
Think about, think about, me right by your side
50 days, 50 days, ultraviolet light
You should stay, you should stay, you should really try

Night swimming, darkness twisting
Lights out, just keep clinging to me
Won't drown, just keep kicking with me
What a feeling, night swimming
Night swimming, we're still dripping
Starlight, just keep wishing on me
Uptight, just keep chilling with me
What a feeling, ah (Night swimming)
Oh, drift out with me, now we got each other
Something beautiful can last forever
Don't forget me now, it'd be so bummer
Sinking under, one last summer
Drift out with me, now we got each other
Something beautiful can last forever
Don't forget me now, it'd be so bummer
Sinking under, one last summer
Night swimming, no more endings, yeah
Night swimming, just keep kicking with me
Night swimming

Night swimming, darkness twisting
Lights out, just keep clinging to me
Won't drown, just keep kicking with me
What a feeling, night swimming

 with me, now we got each other
Something beautiful can last forever (Just keep kicking with me)
Don't forget me now, it'd be so bummer (Just keep kicking with me)
