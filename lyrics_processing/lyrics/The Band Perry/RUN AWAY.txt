Before you knew me, my fears, they ruled me
I couldn't see the good that the world brought to me
A complicated situation, everything controlling me

Then I saw the truth, baby, when you said
All the pretty things that were in your head, boy
You don't overthink like the way I do
Let me fade away with you
I wasn't ready then, but I'm ready now
All the pretty things gonna work themselves out
I don't overthink, now I only feel
Let's make this real

Baby, we can run away, I don't wanna hesitate
Let me be the chance you take, you could be my wild escape
Out of control, yeah, just wanna roll, yeah
That's not a problem with me
Baby, we can run away, baby, we can run away

You're my angel, you faced my demons
You came and made the winter change its season
Devastation to celebration, you were there holding me
You might also like
I wasn't ready then, but you showed me how
All the pretty things on their way to us now
I don't overthink, yeah, I only feel
Let's make this real (make, make this real)

Baby, we can run away, I don't wanna hesitate
Let me be the chance you take, you can be my wild escape
Out of control, yeah, just wanna roll, yeah
That's not a problem with me
Baby, we can run away, baby, we can run away

Run away, come with me
Nothing really stopping us now
Run away, twist of fate
Nothing really stopping us now
Fade away, numb the pain
Lovers and we dropping it now
Run away, come with me
Nothing really stopping us now

Baby, we can run away, I don't wanna calculate
Take a dream and make it fate
Touch me now 'cause I'm not afraid
I won't control ya, go with the flow, yeah
That's not a problem with me
Baby, we can run away, baby, we can run away
Baby, we can run away, I don't wanna hesitate
Let me be the chance you take, you can be my wild escape
Out of control, yeah, you just wanna roll, yeah
Yeah, that's not a problem with me
