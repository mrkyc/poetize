It ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow
But baby, I ate it

They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes
And tell me that you're sorry

Well, you might as well throw gasoline
On a fire
The way you lie

You lie like a priceless Persian rug
On a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine
On my porch
The way you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
You might also like
That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys
And baby, I believed you

So why you lookin' so nervous?
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now
And do the whole wide world a service

Well, my daddy's gonna straighten you out
Like a piece of wire
Like a piece of wire
The way you lie

You lie like the man with the slick back hair
Who sold me that Ford
Well, you lie like the pine tree in the back yard
After last month's storm
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive
To the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long
Bridge
And then I'm not gonna cry-y
Well, maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring
That you put on my finger
Give it a big ol' fling
And watch it sink
Down, down, down
And there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around

Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug
On a rich man's floor
You lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine
On my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well, it's what you do
