He used to run with a gun and a mask
He used to take all your shit and then stash
Now he a good boy, used to be bad
Flashback, digital dash
Go on a run if it's 12 on his ass
Load up the chopper if they tryna clash
Now he a good boy, used to be bad

Huh, shit
Nine times out of ten
He gon' die or he gon' go to jail
Let's not pretend
Huh, look, everybody starts as a kid with a pure heart
Then they turn to him
Papa died, mama died, all the nigga know is sin
Traumatized, freedom jeopardized, he just wanna win
What's a smile when you dodging strikes, dodging every pen'?
Fifteen on his head, he ain't tryna go in
Fifteen on his head, make the po-po grin
Five years later, all that po-po talk is just a...

I've been sending away all the feelings inside
I'm feeling defeat, I'm feeling demise
Running the streets, dodging the sirens
Run from the heat, stay with the iron
Cop killing me, that's not a crime
I sell the weed, I'm doing five

Fully auto with the chopper, make an opper drop up (Brrt)
That's the same shit that send a nigga straight to lock up (Brrt)
That's the system put in place they use to try to stop us (Brrt)

Five years later, all that jail talk is just a...
