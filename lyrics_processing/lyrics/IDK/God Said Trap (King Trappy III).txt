My life been on a better tip ever since I been selling that pack
I wonder how much better it would get if I cooked up crack
I could sell a O of the green in a week and a half
Imagine if that shit was white, hmm... let me do the math
I'ma pull up in an Audi when I push that powder (Doo-doo)
Push the button, start it up, if po-po come, I'm outty (Woo-woo)

Don't you ever doubt me, all my niggas rowdy, all my niggas rowdy, ooh
All my niggas whip that arm and hammer, all 'em armed with hammers (What? What?)
Fuck with me they make you disappear, alaka-kazam ya
Jugging for my niggas in the jammer if I hear you tellin' (What?)
Put some money on my nigga books, leave your body smelling (Alright)
Shaq with the free-throw, I got the bricks (Ayy)
And if the judge try to bargain, I plead the fifth (Ayy)
And if I win, I ain't stoppin', DA, I'm sorry (What? What?)
I'm flipping work 'til my Audi turn to a 'Rari

Yesterday my homie pulled up in his brand new Honda Accord (Honda Accord)
He seen a Porsche that his credit said he couldn't afford (He couldn't afford)
What is a dream that you see but you ain't working towards?
Part of the speech that I gave him when I fronted him four (Bricks)
Kilos of the blow-blow, cut it down, cook it up
That'll make ocho triple-oh-oh
Eighty racks, bring it back, buy his own key, I ain't gotta sell shit
Yeah, that's the way the game go
So, that's more dough than he started with (Yup)
And that's enough dough to buy him a new whip (Alright)
And if he stack up, he gon' buy a new crib
Meanwhile, I'm sitting here getting so rich
Goddamn it this the shit (Alright), Goddamn it this life (Alright)
I ain't gotta think twice
My nigga, I'm good (Alright), and every time I juug (Alright)
I eat steak with the rice
Silver spoon for the kids (Yeah), a dream wedding for the wife (Yeah)
The only thing that I risk is that shit looking like
Nino, New Jack, when they hopped out the van
With that strap, blap, blap
I keep saying I'ma stop someday
Girlfriend saying I'ma get caught one day
I can't stop 'til I get what I want, okay
Only problem is my wants never go away
I want more cars, more clothes, more hoes
And that requires more blow
And if I stop then it's repos, foreclose, fuck that
I need a mill', man, so where the coke and the pills at?
