Him never let the little prick inside his chest go too insane and still knew how to face the truth
Him wandered up and down and all along, the way, away a long time, and the weather was the proof
And when he felt the distance, and began to realize, talking in plain speak he could find
Enunciate and truly find a way to nicely say what he had without losing his mind

Him never blasted me
Him never tried
Him never blasted me

But oh my goodness, oh my gosh, oh my toothbrush, oh my floss
Hand it all over, hands up no sauce, at actorholics anonymous
Came back, came back ran around it three times I've been up for hours
Hummingbird feeders and wind chimes, sorry for you cheaters
As I try to be good and so kind and oh my goodness, oh my gosh

Him never blasted me
Him never tried
Him never blasted me

But he said fat chance, tight pants, back on that wall, you go and dance
Cut a rug with scissors, snow in hell, there's no chance, arm strong like Lance
Beach rat, short pants, need water, deep rants, cut into a cactus
Big fish, Jaws six, tooth faerie make a wish, Nom-Nom flying brick, Napalm too sick
Octopus eight arms, booby traps alarms, 360 full spin, garbage clan, climb in
Green grouch morning, red alert warning, bloodshot blazing, freak flag waving
Pencil ruler, shredder drooler, Look at that light woah, fat chance, ride a rainbow with no hands
Donut bearclaw, bagel and lox, yeah raw, flavored coffee, caramel toffee, Mrs. See's candies
Peppermint patties, andes, mint green mint chip, shred claw, tear rip, Wolverine Mabeline
Dry those tears, Mr. Clean wet wipe, wet nap, applause clap-clap, plush toy stuff you
Babaar and Pooh, fat chance slim jim, helium oxygen, popcorn peanuts, kitty weenis
Dentyne Trident, Bent there pried it, been there done, that cork dart, ball bat, fat chance, bolts slant
Worms worms, ants ants, pet ant wash him, please don't squash him, hi-ho silver, horse bath fill her
Up some wash tub, bathing time, setting sun, true kiss, do this, only one way to get through this
A-bomb, Ray Ban, I rock, I ran, I jog, I Jam, Superman, Peter pan
