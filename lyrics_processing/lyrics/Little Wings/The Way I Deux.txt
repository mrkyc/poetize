Waving hands, I batted it down
Once I see it there's no stopping
I cry and shake, my fists are knocking
At every door I rattle my cage
Through the floor some battle I wage
Oh I would  at any old age
I kick and cry and read my rage
Oh behind doors I'm waiting
Under the curtain's my shoe
My reflection's celebrating
All of the deadly deeds it can do
Shadows hesitating
To creep in or creeping into
Silent time is made for waiting
It waits for me and for you too
The gloom crept up from all around
With waving hands, I batted it down
Once I see it there's no stopping
I cry and shake, my fists are knocking
At every door I rattle my cage
To the floor some war I wage
Oh I would  at any old age
I kick and cry and weep and rage

Under the curtain's my shoe
My reflection's celebrating
All of the deadly deeds it can do
Shadows hesitating
To creep in or creeping into
Silent time is made for waiting
It waits for me and for you too
While we wait as we deux
We hesitate but we push on through
With the face of me and the face of you
While we wait as we deux
The way I deux is dark and
The way I deux is hearkened
Only the way of anything that's living
Only way I do what I feel fitting
I thought it was for my love
Hands on your chest, move around like 
I thought it was for my heart
Icy cold eyes and a cold white sno-cone
I thought it was for anyone
Mouth on my mouth with a new wet warm tongue
I thought it was for anything
That put the shine back on the jewel in the ring
The way I deux is dark and
The way I deux is hearkened
Only the way of anything that's living
Only way I do what I feel fitting
I thought it was for my love
Hands on your chest, move around like 
I thought it was for my heart
Icy cold eyes and a cold white sno-cone
I thought it was for anyone
Mouth on my mouth with a new wet warm tongue
I thought it was for anything
We put the shine back on the jewel in the ring
The way I deux is dark and
The way I deux is hearkened
The way I deux is dark and
