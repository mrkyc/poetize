My voice says make room
May the hand combat the gloom
When the ant comes creeping up
I spread my arms so i'd assume
My vest starts to bloom
With the breath that I consume
And I grow like grass on the hillside
Its the way i leave my tomb
Was it dark in there at all?
It was dark i must admit
Was it you that i heard call?
It was me from yonder pit
You might also likeWas it what you thought was you?
It was me and someone else
I was crying out for you
In high and girly swell
Is the gleam you thought was gone
Beginning to return?
When you lay down on the lawn
Can't you feel its fiery burn
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the doobydoo
Boom
My voice says make room
May the hand combat the gloom
When the dark slips in
I spread my arms so why did I consume
The depth of its doom
With the brightness I resume
And I grow green leaves on my branches
Its the way my blossoms bloom
Wasn't I the wind that blew?
Here is that what you allowed
To come wildly rushing through
You became a gambit howl
Was it finally coming true
It had never ceased to be
Wasn't i the light that grew
Wasn't that light born in me
Here is that what you have touched
When you werent trying to
It was how you made so much
By forgetting what was you
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the doobydoo
And like a mountain peak so high and stout
I blew my little bloomy guts about
I was told i've always been
With flashing flood and whipping wind
