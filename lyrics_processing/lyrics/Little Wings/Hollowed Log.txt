It's hard not to wonder while we think all day
Robbing Paul to keep on paying Peter
How many bad apples does it take to spoil a bunch
Where's Mother Hubbard when you need her
One pig, two pig, three pig, four, this piggy went to the market
Bright red patch on his left hind quart looked a little bit like a target

Whee, whee, whee on the whole ride home, I knew while
We were out I should have fed him and Old King Cole sitting
High on his throne, in each of our own ways I think we let him
It's hard not to budge and to ponder all day, so many eggs in just one basket
Sourdough brain in a loaf of bread way, so many questions you could ask it

When all the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't fix the shatter of the shell, Jack fell again well of course he did
They sent him home with a note that said get well
You've heard the one about the popcorn and the peanuts who truly believed that they could fly
Or that one where a milkshake's split by using two straws and a gal and a guy

Whee, whee, whee on the whole ride home, I knew while
We were out I should have fed him and Old King Cole sitting
High on his throne, in both of our own ways I think we let him
It's hard not to budge and to ponder all day, so many eggs in just one basket
Sourdough brain in a loaf of bread way, so many questions you could ask it
You might also like
Sleeping inside a hollowed log, wild and raw and tameless
I don't give an F, who knows, now, who likes being blameless
Spat out fast and shat at last, a temporary blade of grass
