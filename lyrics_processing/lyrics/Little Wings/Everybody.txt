And so to duly rearrange
The faces that you've seen before
And, let the will of absence pour
The gravity will keep you near
Inside its arms that are so clear that
You may never even see them, but
Realize everything could be them
Up and down your chest will rise
There's no invisible disguise
Your face is open sky sometimes
Your chest a forest grown inside
Feed it, let it grow, and replicate
The universe, you know it has no weight
It waits for magnets, waits for gravity
So I know everything I have was sent for me
Unwrap it all and skin me
Climb on all the branches in me
Look through light and see me in it
Name the game so we can win it
And, everything, oh everything
In your cloaks you go
Disguising what you work through
Talking to me as I go
You might also likeAnd, become my life, become my time
Become that year that's never mine
Let that come through, let glory shine
Grow up and feel the change inside
Expand, expand like land horizon
Sponge and water soak the skies
Intake through what brought you by breathing
Life into the life you're leading
First came dust and light
So it's late at night
And I can see the first thing in your
Headlights while we drive
And we pull over
I am sober
My face looks older
You touch my shoulder
Now you've seen me
Now I've seen you
Now we try somehow to share the time
That we've been through
And, I could feel the brains were born anew
Anew by light of morning, walking
In the skin that grew
It grew me and I grew it too
It knew me and I knew it too
And no one feels the day go through
Exactly in the way I do
That's what makes me, me, and you, you
And I can be what makes me
And you won't be what breaks me
And I can wait for all that wakes me
In the way I've always done
I'm finding out what chose me
How to use the hand that rose me
How to sing the word that woes me
In a way I've just begun
In a way I've just begun unravelling
This costume at the seams that I design
I know it inside out
I know that you attend may bring
But whenever I am here
I am aware of everything
I'm something I can understand
I am the sky, I am the land
I am the foot, I am the hand
I am the wave headed for sand
I am the cattle and the brand
I am the souvenir stand
I am the hometown, local band
I am the mic, I am the stand
