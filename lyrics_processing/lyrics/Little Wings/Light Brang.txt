Look at what that light brang, roll tide roll and lightning
Rap as fast as a thunderclap, I know it's kind of frightening
Look at what that light brought run with it like a marathon
Sleepy Hollow headless and our neighbor calls me Ichabod

Show up on the roof at night, slide right down the chimney
Stuff the stockings, eat the cookies, no, I'm never stingy
Awareness that is Heightening muscles that are tightening
Crimson jersey Bear Bryant, now the corner's brightening

The rhymes I write they bite them, just ain't nothing like them
Then they cannot jump or dance or hit that beat like white men
On a rewind like a playback, I'm about to swing so stay back
TGIF don't you know I just can't wait to lay back
Stella got that groove back, turtle got that smooth back
Lee up on that Baggett, how the folk that neighbor do that?
Deschanel up in that Pantene, water inside that canteen
Dog up in this house and now his cat is wearing panties

Swoosh just like the Nike has three stripes like Adidas
Dunkin' like those Donuts and we know you want to eat us
Mind's eye full of the sun at dawn, backpack full of doobies
Hiking with no sandals on, the lifeguard calls me Scuby

Birthday elf with Christmas wrap a bow around these presents
Can't quit laying golden eggs, hard boiled by the dozens
Can't quit being that golden goose and me and this bunch
Are super loose we'll be tearing the roof of this place later

Look at what that light brang, roll tide roll and lightning
Rap as fast as a thunderclap, I know it's kind of frightening
Look at what that light brought run with it like a marathon
