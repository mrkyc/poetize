With a twisted neck from all the stress that Mickey suffered from
I lay in bed under the shadow of the Magic Kingdom
Will they ever quit or leave I don't know, I've been struck deaf and dumb
I would hitchhike far away but they cut off my thumb (but they cut off my thumb)

No one knows 'cause no one sees the sunset as it glows
And I can't show my face as it's a face that never shows
Shadows are my friends although the secrets live there too
A simple mind I wish I had but what am I to do? (what am I to do?)

I hide and hear the voices of the people having fun
Under a bush I sleep tonight, tomorrow on the run
But with nowhere to run to, I'm confused as where to go
Another lapse and bottle caps litter the ground we know (litter the ground we know)

If the ground we now is doomed by poison, do not drink a drop
I try to trust a human being, be hippie, priest, or cop
Slanted black against the sky, I do not know a when or why
I opt out for a do or die, you know the summer's here (you know the summer's here)

With cars and kids and names to name, I know I am a dying flame
And it's alright no one's to blame, as I still wonder why
Away with it I'm sure it flies, as you tear off your thin disguise
I'm melting as the sun it rises warm into the day
You might also like
The edge you know I'm close to it and all the while the clothes don't fit
I've hardly seen the end of it as the second hand moves on
If the evening's not a friend to me then neither is the dawn
The hand measures the bend in me, the moment's moving on

They used to care I guess. it's fair. I do not show up they don't care
Underneath what was your life and whatever we do tonight
You say it's false, I know it's true, and ripple in the wind
