My voice says make room (Make room)
Wave a hand, combat the gloom
When the ache comes creeping up
I spread my arms so wide that I consume
My best starts to bloom
With the breath that I consume
And I grow like grass on the hillside
It's the way I leave my tomb
"Was it dark in there at all?"
It was dark I must admit
"Was it you that I heard call?"
It was me from yonder pit
"Was it what you thought was you?"
It was me as someone else
I was crying out for you
In high and girly swell
Is the gleam you thought was gone
Beginning to return?
When you lay down on the lawn
Can't you feel its fiery burn?
See the rooftops in the Sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the doobydoo
You might also likeBoom (Boom)
My voice says make room (Make room)
Wave a hand, combat the gloom
When the dark slips in
I spread my arms so wide that I consume
The depth of its doom
With the brightness I resume
And I grow green leaves on my branches
Its the way my blossoms bloom
"Wasn't I the wind that blew?"
It was that what you allowed
To come wildly rushing through
You became a gambit howl
"Was it finally coming true?"
It had never ceased to be
"Wasn't I the light that grew?"
"Wasn't that light born in me?"
It was that what you had touched
When you weren't trying to
It was how you made so much
By forgetting what was you
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the doobie doo
And like a mountain peak so high and stout
I blew my lid, I blew my guts about
So I'm tall, I've always been
With flashing flood and whipping wind
