A microphone test or a dense dictation
Last time, they tried to fit me in a funny suit
This time, they tried to fill my pocket full of loot
Next time, they'll start to weep while I'm bailing
Next time, I'll have to wait through their wailing
Last time, they had to hang me like a poster
This time, they rode me like a rollercoaster
Next time, they'll have to find me if they wanna try
Next time, they'll have a long time to wonder why
I always turn my head when they walk by
I make believe my shoelace came untied
Better yet act like something's in my eye
Oh I gotta do what I don't want to
High as the heaps that hunt and haunt you
Pouring to paint your peeling won't you
Pull a pal away when he's reeling don't you
Look at last time for one minute
I promise I'll try
Look at this time will and win it
With a gleaming in my eye
Look at next time search and squint it
Pull power from the sky
Look at what the light does when we're in it
So I wonder why, I stop to wonder why
Last time, they spread me shallow like the gravel
This time, they struck me twice like a gavel
Order in the court!
What court? is the question
Give no retort, leave everybody guessing
Last time, they bent me over like a rainbow
This time, they step through me like a tango
Next time, I'll abbreviate it so they won't lose their breath every time they say it
Oh I'll keep a song inside their head and bloom
Feed it sweet light, fertilize it with some tune
If words are the wrist then music's the perfume
Oh song from the mouth of friend or stranger
Dangerous bird or bird of danger
If you can keep up, well why won't you?
Songs everywhere, so I sing it, don't you?
Look at last time for one minute
I'll promise I'll try
Look at this time will and win it
With a gleaming in my eye
Look at next time search and squint it
Pull power from the sky
Look at what the light does when we're in it
Now I wonder why, I stop to wonder why
Last time, last time
This time, this time
Next time, next time
