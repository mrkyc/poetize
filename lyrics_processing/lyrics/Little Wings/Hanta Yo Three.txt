On the trail where the Sun fell down and shattered needle
For the pattern on your fur where lichen so long
To the perch of rotting log, for wood bark beetle
I do admit, it's getting better all the time
My motor mouth is busy celebrating
The misty mountain high, I like it bounty fine
Ten knuckles wrap around the nest I'm raiding
So one, two, easy
Hanto Yo Three
For the bird-breath cat is me
My coat is made of autumn leaves, all dyin on their branches
When they die, as a phantom lies
I've lost my life so many times
So many times, I see that the cat that the cat with bird breath mouth is me
Oh bird brain, you're perched low enough to feel my breath
So you can see my whiskers while you're singing
My, what feathers have be got, like all the rest
Below your tree, I'll wait with what I'm bringing
And the roar you feel as I come cross that rumble-roo
As taste it from the meadow in the distance
I was hungry early on, this much is true
And one moment, your range is our existence
You might also likeSo one, two, easy
Hanta Yo Three
With the cat with the bird-breath mouth is me
Pet me in the wrong way
Scratchin' bloody mouth paw
Give tough granted
One, two, three
We'll be where the sky meets paper, meets pen meets probably
Cling to the branch, we'll see I'm the bird-breath cat in the sky, slanted
Through the way unto doth say it
And the third time we display it
As death and destruction, things fall apart sometimes
With the blood that stopped in vain
And the oxygen it claims
It's dark at the door, and the bell on its wretched chime
So the branch is broken too
And the only thing left to do
Recollect yourself, put a face on, tattered, and true
For the stars are to your eyes
And the universe, your size
And a quick away wide will in face that it all come through
So Hanta Yo Three
We want to see that the bird-breath cat is me
Sing a small song then fly on by
I'm flattened by the freeway
One, two, three
We'll meet from the brisk and cleave from the eyes never gotten me
Go to the big blank vine, to sing song blind
