I've been sleeping all alone
Cause I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I wanna kiss you
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Oooh oooh oooh

I've been moaning in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Cause I miss you child
I've been waiting in the hall
I've been waiting for your call
And the phone rings
It's just a friend of mine saying
"Hey hey, what's the matter with you, girl?
We're gonna come around about twelve
With some bad Puerto Rican dudes oooh
They are going to be just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
And we're gonna mess around like we used to"

I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people "Hey, what's the matter with ya, boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to myself

Cause I miss you, baby

Waiting on your call
