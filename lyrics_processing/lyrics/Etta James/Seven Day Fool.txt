And on a Tuesday, I'm gonna hug ya
And on a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday, gonna love ya
I work for you, baby, work my hand to the bone
Care for you, baby, till the cows come home
Do for you, baby, for the love that I seek
Slave for you, baby, every day of the week

Scrub your dirty floor
(On a Tuesday)
I do a whole lot more
(On a Wednesday)

To have a little lovin' 'fore the weekend goes

Only because I really love you
