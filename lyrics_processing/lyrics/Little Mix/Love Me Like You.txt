Sha-la-la-la

He might got the biggest ca-a-ar
Don't mean he can drive me wild or he can go for miles
Said he got a lotta ca-a-ash
Darlin', he can't buy my love, it's you I'm dreamin' of

They try to romance me, but you got that nasty (Ooh, ah)
And that's what I want (That's what I want)
So, baby, baby, come and save me
Don't need those other numbers when I got my number one

Last night, I laid in bed so blue
'Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby, they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you (Ah)

Used to get it when I wa-a-ant
You were pourin' out your love, I could never get enough
Now I'm dealin' with these bo-o-oys
When I really need a man who can do it like I can
You might also like
They try to romance me, but you got that nasty (Ooh, ah)
And that's what I want (That's what I want)
So, baby, baby, come and save me
Don't need those other lovers when I got my number one

Last night, I laid in bed so blue
'Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby, they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you

Sha-la-la-la (Woo-ooh)
Sha-la-la-la (Oh, oh)
Sha-la-la-la (Oh)
Can't love me like you
Sha-la-la-la (Woo-ooh)
Sha-la-la-la (Oh, oh)
Sha-la-la-la (Oh)
Can't love me like you

L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me
When you're with me, boy, I want it every day
L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me
When you're with me, boy, I want it every day
Last night, I lay in bed so blue (I lay in bed so blue)
'Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you (Love me like you)
I tried to find somebody new (New)
Baby, they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you (Can't love me like you)
(L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me) Last night, I lay in bed so blue
(L-O-V-E, boy, I want it everyday) 'Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you
(L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me) I tried to find somebody new
