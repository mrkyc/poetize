Hah-ah
Hah-ah

I keep tryin', nothing's workin'
I still wanna know if you're alone
I keep tryin' to put this behind me
I still wanna know who's taking you home

For tonight, I'm gonna get my mind off it
Don't care that someone's got his hands all over my body
Stay out all night, go where the music is loud
So I don't have to think about it
I'm beggin', please, don't play

No more sad songs
No more sad songs
No more sad songs
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more sad songs
No more sad songs
No more sad songs
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more sad songs

For tonight, I'm gonna to get my mind off it

Lights pass, sit back with the windows down (Woah)
I still got you on my mind (Woah)
Starting to realise (Woah)
No matter what I do
I will only hurt myself tryna hurt you
And if I turn the music loud, just to drown you out
I'm beggin', please, don't play, no more
