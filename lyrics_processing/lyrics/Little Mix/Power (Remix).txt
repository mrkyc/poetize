Hold up, no, you didn't bow, bow
I ain't the chick to walk behind you 'round town
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby, oh

I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it (Uh-huh)
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

You're the man
But I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain
But I make it, I make it, I make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, long as you don't forget

Who got the power?
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
Hold up!

Start my engine, push the button, 'cause I'm gon' be coming first, ow!

Yeah, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it (Uh-huh)

When them boys talk loose and tell you power's for a king (Huh?)
You just play it cool and tell 'em, "Power's not a thing" (What?)
You look him in the eye and say, "I know I'm not a guy
But see, there's power in my losses and there's power in my wins"
Independent woman, look to shower in your Bimms
They call me "Cocoa," but I'm mad, you can't be powderin' my skin
And you don't need to spend another hour in the gym
You know, I'm blinded by his grace, but when you found me, I was dim

And we'll be countin' down the years, yeah, I'm about this
All them dirty secrets that we share, I'll clear the browsers
We the type to build on our careers and share the houses
You can be a woman and a boss and wear the trousers at the same time
