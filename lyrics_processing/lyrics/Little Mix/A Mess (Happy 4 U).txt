Hey!
Hey!
Hm, mm

No bad blood, but we don't speak
It's been a hundred fifty days, or twenty-one weeks
Oh-woah-oh, who's countin', though?
I saw you holding hands on New Bond Street
She in the same cute tee that you bought me
Oh-woah-oh, she rockin' it, though

And you know I'd be lyin'
If I said I don't feel nothin' at all, I
I've been tryna be the bigger person
But it's hard when I've been feelin' so small
And nobody knows

I'm still a mess, oh, since you left
If I can't be happy, happy with you
I'll be happy, happy for you
I guess, no hard feelings
'Cause love's looking good on you
If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you

We fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got my peace sign (In the air, yeah, yeah)
Baby, we fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you

Don't wanna be sour, but it's bittersweet (Woah)
A bad taste in my mouth 'cause you're over me (Oh)
Oh-woah-oh, time to let go
Please don't say "Hi," I don't wanna be rude (Oh)
She seems so sweet and I'm tryna be cool
Woah-oh-oh, hold tight all my broken-hearted

And you know I'd be lyin'
If I said I don't feel nothin' at all, and I
I'm gon' get my drip, gon' fix my makeup
Ain't got time for being emotional
And nobody knows

I'm still a mess, oh, since you left (Oh, since you left)
If I can't be happy, happy with you
I'll be happy, happy for you
I guess (I guess), no hard feelings
'Cause love's looking good on you
If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you
We fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got my peace sign (In the air, yeah, yeah)
Baby, we fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you

Hey, check, hey, check, hey, check, hey, check
Check-check myself when I see you walkin' by
Check-check myself, don't wanna look into your eyes
Protect myself, 'cause the feelings never lie
Hey, check, hey, check, hey, check, hey, check
Check-check myself when I see you walkin' by
Check-check myself, don't wanna look into your eyes
Protect myself, 'cause the feelings never lie
Hey, hey, hey, hey

We fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got my peace sign (In the air, yeah, yeah, oh)
Baby, we fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you (For you, woah)

I'm still a mess (I'm still a mess), oh, since you left (Since you left now)
If I can't be happy, happy with you (Oh)
I'll be happy, happy for you (Oh)
I guess (Hm, I guess) no hard feelings (No hard feelings)
'Cause love's looking good on you
If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you (Oh-woah, oh-oh)
We fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, got my peace sign)
Got my peace sign (In the air, yeah, yeah, oh-oh)
Baby, we fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you're happy, I'm happy, I'm happy for you (I'm happy for you)
We fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, happy for you)
Got my peace sign (In the air, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, we fine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
