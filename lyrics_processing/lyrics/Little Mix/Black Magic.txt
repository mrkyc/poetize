Is your lover playing on your side?
Said he loves ya, but he ain't got time
Here's the answer, come and get it

Full of honey just to make him sweet
Crystal balling just to help him see
What he's been missing, so come and get it

Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say

Take a sip from my secret potion, I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken, one drop should be enough
