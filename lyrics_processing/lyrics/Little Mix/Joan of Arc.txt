Hey, hey
Damn

One foot in the club, everybody watch me
One pop of the booty, everybody love me
Ain't the reason I'm cocky
I make myself feel sexy
Fan of myself, I'm stannin' myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself
Fan of myself, I'm stannin' myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself

Man, I feel like Cleopatra
Joan of Arc, Queen of Hearts, yeah
Tonight, it's only me that matters
Oh, you on that feminist tip?
Hell yeah, I am

I don't need a man
If I'm lovin' you, it's 'cause I can ('Cause I can)
I don't want your cash
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand (What?)
I don't need a man (Uh, uh)
If I'm lovin' you, it's 'cause I can
