You and I and nobody else
Feeling feelings I've never felt
The way you got me under your spell (Uh)
Don't you keep it all to yourself

So, won't you take it? (Hey)
I feel like for the first time, I am not faking (Hey)
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing (Hey)
Master of anticipation, don't you keep it all to yourself

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Hey)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Hey)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Hey)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Hey)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Hey)
