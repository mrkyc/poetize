I lost my faith
Made my mistakes
Gonna find a way to make it easy
I'll be better on my own, believe me
Pain I hold back
Can't live like that
Yeah, I made my peace with all of the sorrow
And now I'm living for tomorrow

I'm a girl with a new face (Face)
And a life that's been changed (Changed)
You know (You know), you know (You know)
You know

I was a little bit lost, but I'm not anymore
I was a little bit hurt, but I'm not anymore
I was a little left out, but I'm not anymore
'Cause the tears fell down, but they don't anymore
I was a little messed up, but I'm not anymore
I was a little lucked out, but I'm not anymore
I was a little far gone, but I'm not anymore
Yeah, it's alright now, baby, I got the cure

Now it's me and myself (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't need no one else
This happiness was always inside me
But Lord, it took a minute to find me
And this freedom I found
Is worth a million of you now
And I'm puttin' all my troubles behind me
I only need my heart to guide me (Yeah)

I'm a girl with a new face
And a life that's been changed
You know, you know, you know
