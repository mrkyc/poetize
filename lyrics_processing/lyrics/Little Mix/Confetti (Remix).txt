Little Mix (Oh)
Saweetie, hmm (Oh)
Let's go

We wanna celebrate
Like we in the club every day
Got all my friends here with me
And I don't need ya, I don't need ya
Got this dress up on me
So I don't need your stress up on me
Baby, we're done, c'est la vie
Now I don't need ya, I don't need ya

Shoulda left your ass from time ago
Didn't love me then, but now I do
I used to sit at home and cry for you
Diamonds on my neck, I shine for you
Ain't blockin' my blessings anymore
Never be the girl I was before
I'ma let the good things in my life rain down

From the sky, drop like confetti
All eyes on me
So VIP
All of my dreams
From the sky, drop like confetti (Drop it down)
You're missin' me
But I'm finally free
I got what I need
So let it rain down like confetti
You might also like
Flashin' lights
I ain't got a worry on my mind
Know that you're mad I realised
That I don't need ya, I don't need ya
So, DJ, say my name
Like it's my birthday
You're just a memory
And, boy, I don't need ya, I don't need ya

Shoulda left your ass from time ago (Time ago)
Didn't love me then, but now I do (Now I do)
I'ma let the good things in my life rain down

From the sky, drop like confetti
All eyes on me (On me, yeah)
So VIP
All of my dreams
From the sky, drop like confetti (Woah, drop it down)
You're missin' me (You're missin' me)
But I'm finally free (Finally free)
I got what I need
So let it rain down (Rain like confetti)
Oh, la-la-la, let it rain down (Rain down)
Oh, la-la-la, let it rain down (Let it, let it rain down)
Oh, la-la-la, let it rain down (Let it rain down)
Oh, la-la-la, let it rain

So my girl hit me up about her fuckboy dude
I said, "Hold on, hold on, what he say he did to you?"
Caught him sendin' dick pics and a couple of nudes
Shit, we can chop it off and I'ma Bobbitt in stew
I don't play that shit (No, no), beat his ass on (Slow-mo)
Ride or die on go-go, nigga, I'm a Yoko Ono (Ono)
I'm an artsy bitch, you're gonna miss these lips
Now I'ma have to slap yours with my Swavorski tips (That's right)
I'm a Cancer baby, but I got Scorpio ways
Credit high on all my cards, top one is my face
Get a pedi in my Tessie, yeah, there's plenty of space
New it-girl on the block, they all copy and paste
Face on Halle, body on Chloe (Yeah)
Ain't givin' you a chance, I'ma give it to your homie
Mood on petty, so promiscuous, you ain't gettin' this (Oh)

From the sky, drop like confetti
All eyes on me
So VIP
All of my dreams
From the sky, drop like confetti (All of my dreams, woah)
You're missin' me (You're missin' me)
I'm finally free (But I'm finally free)
I got what I need (I got what I need)
So let it rain down like confetti
Oh, la-la-la, let it rain down
Oh, la-la-la, let it rain down
Oh, la-la-la, let it rain down
