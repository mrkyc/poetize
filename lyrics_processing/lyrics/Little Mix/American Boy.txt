Singin', singin', singin'
Ooh, la, la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And, ooh, la, la, my American boy
(Singing, singing, singing)

And I met him back when I was out in Californ-I-A
He was playin' in a band and she was dancin' on a stage
And he says that I'm the one, but she's the one that got away
And he never knew her real name

Oh, and I don't mean to get so caught up
And insecure 'bout all the things you say (Say, say, say, say)
Oh, and I don't mean to be jealous, it's just careless me
Boy, I must drive you mad

Singin', singin', singin'
Ooh, la, la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And, ooh, la, la, my American boy
Singin', singin', singin'
Ooh, la, la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And, ooh, la, la, my American boy
My American boy

So, I wanna know who's on your phone
Making me paranoid, making me bad
Making me sad, making me crazy
And making me feel like I needed to ask
I wanna know if you're at home
And if you're at home, baby, are you alone?
Are you alone? Answer your phone
Oh, baby, no, no, no

Oh, and I don't mean to get so caught up (Say)
And insecure 'bout all the things you say (Say, say, say, say)
Oh, and I don't mean to be jealous, it's just careless me
Boy, I must drive you mad

Singin', singin', singin'
