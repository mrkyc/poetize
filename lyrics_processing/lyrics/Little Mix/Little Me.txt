She lives in the shadow of a lonely girl
Voice so quiet you don't hear a word
Always talking, but she can't be heard
You can see it there if you catch her eye
I know she's brave, but it's trapped inside
Scared to talk, but she don't know why

Wish I knew back then what I know now
Wish I could, somehow, go back in time
And maybe listen to my own advice

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful
Everything she doesn't see
You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be
Little me

Yeah, you got a lot of time to act your age
You can't write a book from a single page
Hands on the clock only turn one way, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Run too fast and you risk it all
Can't be afraid to take a fall
Felt so big, but you look so small
You might also like
Wish I knew back then what I know now
Wish I could, somehow, go back in time
And maybe listen to my own advice

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful
Everything she doesn't see (And know that right here, right now)
You gotta speak up (Speak up), you gotta shout out (Shout out)
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna to be
Oh, little me

Little me, yeah, yeah, hey (Hey; Ah)
Tell you one thing, I would say to her, oh, woah

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful (Beautiful, wonderful)
Everything she doesn't see (You got to, you got to shout, woah)
You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be (Be, yeah, yeah)
I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out (Little me, woah)
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful
Everything she doesn't see
You gotta speak up, you got to shout out (Woah)
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be (Tell you one thing I would say to her; Hey)
I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out (Ah-woah, hey!)
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful (*Ooh, woah*)
Everything she doesn't see (*You got to*)
You gotta speak up, you got to shout out (*Shout, yeah*)
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be
