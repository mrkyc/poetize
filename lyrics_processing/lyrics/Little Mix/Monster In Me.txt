Beautiful creatures, you and me
Every time that we touch, it's dangerous
This spark is more than chemistry
Beautiful liars, drownin' deep
Every night we fight and it's hot like hell
But it feels like heaven between the sheets

Every time we let go
I scream and I call for more

Touch me
Why don't we kill each other slowly?
What can I say? Baby, what can I do?
The monster in me loves the monster in you
Hold me
Squeeze a little tighter till we can't breathe
What can I say? Baby, what can I do?
The monster in me loves the monster in you

Monster in me
Mmm, mmm, ayy, ayy
Loves the monster in you
Mmm, mmm, ayy, ayy
You might also like
Beautiful killer, cut me deep
Just a single kiss and I'm in your spell
Boy, you go in like I've never seen
Beautiful fire, love the heat, mmm
Every night we fight and it's hot like hell
But I love the way that you make me scream

And every time I let go
I cry and I beg for more, more

Touch me
Why don't we kill each other slowly?
What can I say? Baby, what can I do?
The monster in me loves the monster in you
Hold me
Squeeze a little tighter till we can't breathe (Can't breathe, baby)
What can I say? Baby, what can I do?
The monster in me loves the monster in you

Monster in me
Mmm, mmm, ayy, ayy
Loves the monster in you
Mmm, mmm, ayy, ayy (Hey, yeah)
Every moment we spend
Turning from friends to enemies
And fighting to hold on to each other
Every second we fall to fire below
It's so beautiful
The hell that we're both made for each other
But it's all love and war
Louder we roar
Crying for more
I know it's so wrong, but baby, just

Touch me
Why don't we kill each other slowly? (Slowly, yeah)
What can I say? Baby, what can I do? (Baby, what can I do? Oh)
The monster in me loves the monster in you (Loves the monster in you, babe)
Hold me
Squeeze a little tighter (Squeeze a little tighter) till we can't breathe (I can't breathe, ooh)
What can I say? Baby, what can I do? (Oh, what can I do, baby?)
The monster in me loves the monster in you

The monster in me, yeah
Wanting me, haunting you
Haunting me, haunting you (Oh)
Wanting me, haunting you (Oh, woah)
Haunting me, haunting you
Oh, wanting me, haunting you
Haunting me, haunting you
Oh, wanting me, haunting you
