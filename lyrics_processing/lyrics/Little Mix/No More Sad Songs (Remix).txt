Hah-ah
Ayy, with your eyes wide shut
Hah-ah
No more, no more

I keep tryin', nothing's workin'
I still wanna know if you're alone
I keep tryin' to put this behind me
I still wanna know who's taking you home

For tonight, I'm gonna get my mind off it
Don't care that someone's got his hands all over my body
Stay out all night, go where the music is loud
So I don't have to think about it
I'm beggin', please, don't play

No more sad songs
No more sad songs
No more sad songs
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more sad songs
No more sad songs
No more sad songs
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more sad songs

Taste of the good life, can you keep pace?
Can you ride shotgun in the fast lane
With your eyes wide shut, tell me, do you have faith in me?
Stay the whole night 'til you feel the sunrays
Can you forget everything your man sayin' (Ayy)
And let all of our pain be the champagne? (Hah-ah)
Let me take the wheel from here
And penthouse suite chill from here
Show you the realest years (Hah-ah)
Stare at the skies with you, only got eyes for you
Even when the light's off, I'm visualising you (Hah-ah)
I see your wonder wall, I get close to you
I watch you let it fall and get emotional (Hah-ah)
Erase the past, we are free at last
I'm beggin', please, don't play no more

No more (Woo) sad songs (Ayy)
No more sad songs (No more)
No more sad songs
I'm beggin', please, don't play (Beggin', I'm beggin', no more)
No more sad songs
No more sad songs (No more, no more; no more)
No more sad songs (No more, no more)
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more sad songs (Yeah)
No more sad songs (Little Mix)
No more sad songs (Young Gunner, haha, none other, ayy)
No more sad songs
No more sad songs
No more sad songs (No more, no more, no more, no more, ayy)
