All damn night, I was here waiting (Waiting)
Cooked your favourite, dressed up real nice
I know you were with her, I know that you kissed her
You came home late, man, I was so mad (So mad)
Had my breakup speech ready
Then you kiss my face, it's the way you persuade me

You're dirty, disgusting
But I can't get 'nough of your loving
Boy, I hate you, really hate you
My momma said I shouldn't date you
You're cheatin', you're lyin'
I know that you're hidin' two cellphones (Cellphones)
But, boy, right before I say that it's the end

You sweet talk me again, yo
I don't wanna be friends, no
Why am I such a fool when it comes to you?
A, B, C, D, E-E-eee, F.U

All my friends say I'm a sucker (Sucker)
Can't explain, it's complicated
I wish you were dead till you take me to bed
You're so good, so good, you little mother (Mother; Mmm)
Oh, them brown eyes and that body
I'll get my revenge, take my keys to your Benz
You might also like
You're dirty, disgusting
But I can't get 'nough of your loving
Boy, I hate you, really hate you
My momma said I shouldn't date you
You're cheatin', you're lyin'
I know that you're hidin' two cellphones (Cellphones)
But, boy, right before I say that it's the end

You sweet talk me again, yo
I don't wanna be friends, no
Why am I such a fool when it comes to you?
A, B, C, D, E-E-eee, F.U

I wanna say, "Shoo, shoo" (Ooh)
I wanna say, "Screw you"
I practice my (Ooh) lines in the mirror
Then you smile, that's my killer (Ooh, oh)
So I say, "Love you"
And, "Baby, I need you"
'Cause you're drop dead (Oh-oh) gorgeous (Oh)
And Cupid ain't coming to warn us

You're dirty, disgusting
But I can't get 'nough of your loving
Boy, I hate you, really hate you (Ooh, ooh)
My momma said I shouldn't date you (Ooh, ooh)
You're cheatin', you're lyin'
I know that you're hidin' two cellphones
*But boy, right before I say that it's the end*
You sweet talk me again, yo
I don't wanna be friends, no (No, I don't wanna be your friend)
Why am I such a fool when it comes to you?
