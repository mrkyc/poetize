Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

It started with "What's up with you?"
I messed around and got caught up with you
Yeah, yeah, I don't know what to do
I've got these feelings like there's nothing new
Now I can't get enough of you, oh

And when I think about the way you touch my body
I don't know how long I can wait (Ah-ah-ah)
And when I think about the way you touch my body
This could be my greatest mistake
You've got me singing

Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do (Do)
Oops, baby, I love you
You might also like
We had a good run
We messed around and had some good fun
Guess it turns out I lost a good one (Ooh)
'Cause now I'm wishing every morning would come
With you next to me, baby (Oh, yeah)

And when I think about the way you touch my body
This could be my greatest mistake
You've got me singing

Oops (Oops), my baby
You woke up in my bed (You woke up in my bed)
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do (Ooh)
Oops, baby, I love you

Ooh, I, I, I love you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now I accidentally know that you're in love with me, too
Oops, baby, I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If it was up to me, I would take a time machine
To the day I said goodbye (I lied)
Oh, I lied, so can we try again? (Ohh)
Beneficial, more than friends
No, don't you tell me goodbye
You've got me singing
Oops, my baby (Yeah), you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you (I love, I love, I love you)

Oops, I love you, ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you (Oh, I still love you)
Singin', oops, I love you (Yeah, yeah), ooh, ooh, ooh
Now I accidentally know that you're in love with me, too (Ooh)
