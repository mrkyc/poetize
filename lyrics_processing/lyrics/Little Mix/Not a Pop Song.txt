They look for picture perfect
Don't look deeper than the surface
Bubblegum always pops
And stars, they fade out, life never stops

I don't do what Simon says
Get the message 'cause it's read
That's just life, it never plays fair
Said to follow any dream
Be a puppet on a string
Works for you, but that isn't me

This ain't another pop song 'bout fallin' in love
Or a party song 'bout drinks and drugs
No more singing songs 'bout breaking my heart
And my lonely nights dancin' in the dark
If I'm a guilty pleasure, I want this life forever
I'll take it all 'cause anything is better
Than another pop song 'bout fallin' in love
But if you wanna sing along say, "I don't give a what"

A hamster on a wheel
That's how it feels tryna be real
These unrealistic expectations
Said we'll make it if we fake it
You might also like
I don't do what Simon says
Get the message 'cause it's read
That's just life, it never plays fair
Said to follow any dream
Be a puppet on a string
Works for you, but that isn't me

This ain't another pop song 'bout fallin' in love
Or a party song 'bout drinks and drugs (Drinks and drugs, drugs)
No more singing songs 'bout breaking my heart (And my lonely nights)
And my lonely nights dancin' in the dark (Dark)
If I'm a guilty pleasure (Pleasure), I want this life forever (Forever)
I'll take it all 'cause anything is better (Ah)
Than another pop song 'bout fallin' in love
But if you wanna sing along say, "I don't give a what"

No broken bottles
Or glitter on the floor from the night before
Ain't no boy troubles
If that's what you came here for, then you should know that

This ain't another pop song 'bout fallin' in love
Or a party song 'bout drinks and drugs
No more singing songs 'bout breaking my heart (Ooh)
And my lonely nights dancin' in the dark (Ah, if I'm)
If I'm a guilty pleasure (Pleasure), I want this life forever (Ever)
I'll take it all 'cause anything is better
(Thing is better than another pop song)
Than another pop song 'bout fallin' in love
(But if you wanna sing along say; Yeah, oh)
But if you wanna sing along say, "I don't give a what"
Not a pop song (Ooh, ooh)
I don't give a what (Oh, no, no, oh, woah)
Not a pop song
