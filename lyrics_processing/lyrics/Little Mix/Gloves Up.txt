Up-purrrup, put your, put your, put your gloves up
Up-purrrup, put them all the way up
Up-purrrup, put your, put your, put your gloves up
Boy, you better put 'em high

Sweat on the carpet, blood on the walls
Nothing can stop me, stop the applause
They thought I was over, down on the floor
Ain't tappin' out, see me comin' for more
Start a riot, ruckus and rage
Ready to rumble, ain't scared of the pain
Shots to my body, no tears on my face
Ain't throwing the towel in or runnin' away

Ooh, can't nobody tell me nothing
Just know, I'm gonna be startin' somethin'

I, I got my eyes on the prize
Fight 'til the day that I die
Can't knock me down and that's why
I got 'em all the way up
Takin' this moment, it's mine
Brighter than bright I will shine
Can't knock me down and that's why
I got 'em all the way up

Up-purrrup, put your, put your, put your gloves up
Up-purrrup, put them all the way up (All the way up)
Up-purrrup, put your, put your, put your gloves up
Boy, you better put 'em high

Baby, I'm gunnin', gunnin' for gold
'Cause I've been breakin', breaking the mould
We'll rewrite the history pages, believe that
Make sure they don't forget, change the green to red, legend of the four divas

Ooh, can't nobody tell me nothing
Just know, I'm gonna be startin' somethin'

I, I got my eyes on the prize
Fight 'til the day that I die (Day that I die)
Can't knock me down and that's why (You can't knock me down)
I got 'em all the way up
Takin' this moment, it's mine (I'm takin', oh)
Brighter than bright I will shine (I will shine)
Can't knock me down and that's why
I got 'em all the way up
All the way, all the way up (Oh, woah, woah)
All the way, all the way up (All the way up)
All the way, all the way up (Ooh)
I got 'em all the way up

Up-purrrup, put your, put your, put your gloves up
Up-purrrup, put them all the way up (All the way up)
Up-purrrup, put your, put your, put your gloves up
Boy, you better put 'em high (All the way up)
Up-purrrup, put your, put your, put your gloves up
Up-purrrup, put them all the way up
Up-purrrup, put your, put your, put your gloves up
