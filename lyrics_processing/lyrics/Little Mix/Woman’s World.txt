Every day she tells her daughter
"Baby, you're not just a pretty face"
She says, "You gotta work much harder
Than every single man, that's just the way"

But she goes to the same job every day
She's overworked and underpaid
Just 'cause the way her body's made
Ain't that insane?

If you never been told how you gotta be
What you gotta wear, how you gotta speak
If you never shouted to be heard
You ain't lived in a woman's world
And if you can't see that it's gotta change
Only want the body, but not the brains
If you think that's the way it works
You ain't lived in a woman's world, no

Try living, try, try living (No, no)
Try living, try, try living (Oh)
Try livin' in a woman's world

Every night she tells her daughter
"Don't you know a change is gonna come?"
There's a whisper in the water
And I know the tide is gonna turn, no, no, no (Oh)

But she goes to the same job every day
She's overworked and underpaid
Just 'cause the way her body's made
Ain't that insane? (Oh)

If you never been told how you gotta be
What you gotta wear, how you gotta speak
If you never shouted to be heard
You ain't lived in a woman's world
And if you can't see that, it's gotta change
Only want the body, but not the brains
If you really think that's the way it works
You ain't lived in a woman's world, uh-huh

Just look at how far that we've got (That we've got)
And don't think that we'll ever stop
This ain't the way it's gonna be (This ain't the way it's gonna be)
No, this ain't the way it's got to be, oh (Oh, no)
Know that there will be a day (One day)
When everyone's treated the same (No)
It's the only way it's got to be (Only way it's gotta be)
It's the only way it's got to be, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you never been told how you gotta be
What you gotta wear, how you gotta speak
Never shouted to be heard
You ain't lived in a woman's world
And if you can't see that it's gotta change
Only want the body, but not the brains
If you think that's the way it works
You ain't lived in a woman's world (You ain't)

Try living, try, try living (Living in a woman's world)
Try living, try, try living
In a woman's, in a woman's world (Woman's; Oh, na, na, na)
Try living, try, try living (*Try living*)
Try living, try, try living (*Yeah, ooh*)
In a woman's, in a woman's world (Oh)

Let me hear you say
Try living, try, try living
You've got to try
Try living, try, try living

Try living in a woman's, a woman's world
