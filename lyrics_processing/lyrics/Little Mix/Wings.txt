Mama told me not to waste my life (Ah-ooh)
She said, "Spread your wings, my little butterfly (Ah-ooh)
Don't let what they say keep you up at night (Ah-ooh)
And if they give you shh, then they can walk on by"

My feet, feet can't touch the ground
And I can't hear a sound
But you just keep on running up your mouth, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Walk, walk on over there
'Cause I'm too fly to care, oh, yeah

Your words don't mean a thing
I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is

Mama told me not to waste my life
She said, "Spread your wings, my little butterfly
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you 'cause wings are made to fly"
And we don't let nobody bring us down (Down, down)
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly (Hey, hey)
You might also like
I'm firing up on that runway
I know we're gonna get there someday
But we don't need no ready steady go, no
Talk, talk turns into air
And I don't even care, oh, yeah

Your words don't mean a thing
I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is

Mama told me not to waste my life
She said, "Spread your wings, my little butterfly
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you 'cause wings are made to fly"
(Let 'em fly, let 'em fly, fly)
And we don't let nobody bring us down
(Down, down; Let 'em fly, let 'em fly, fly)
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
(Let 'em fly, let 'em fly, fly)
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
(Let 'em fly, let 'em fly, fly)
These wings are made to fly
I don't need no one sayin', "Hey, hey, hey, hey"
I don't hear no one sayin', "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
You'd better keep on walkin'
I don't wanna hear your talking, boy'd
You'd better keep on walkin'
I don't wanna hear your talking, boy'd

Your words don't mean a thing (Don't mean a thing)
I'm not listening (Not listening)
They're just like water off my wings

Mama told me not to waste my life (Ooh, woah)
She said, "Spread your wings, my little butterfly (My little butterfly)
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you (They can't detain you)
'Cause wings are made to fly" (Let 'em fly, let 'em fly, fly)
And we don't let nobody bring us down
(Down, down; Let 'em fly, let 'em fly, fly)
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
(Let 'em fly, let 'em fly, fly; Oh, woah)
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
(Let 'em fly, let 'em fly, fly; Oh, woah)
These wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down (Down, down)
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
