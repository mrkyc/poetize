I lost my innocence over intolerance
All the indignities heaped on the black man
We went to church, they all prayed for the white man
The cops and the preachers were most of 'em in the Klan
What's a kid s'posed to think when the adults
Are all such hypocrites impossibly smug

I have seen enough (Seen enough)
I have seen enough of this
Had enough (Seen enough)
Quite enough, I swear (Seen enough of this)

The next generation, the Woodstock nation
A little bit flaky, but no hesitation
Stop the war, it wasn't worth dyin' for
The paranoia of the cold warriors
Arrogant old men with domino theories
Fractured fairy tales tryin' to kill me

I have seen enough (Seen enough)
I have seen enough of this
I have read enough (Seen enough)
History to see right through me (Seen enough of this)

You got outcast upset people you never met
Locked in the basement, hot-wired to the net
Isolated, infuriated, the punchline to the joke
Is how they are gonna smoke
Every last stuck-up snob ever dissed them
Look in their eyes, how could you miss them?

Ain't you seen enough (Seen enough)
I have seen enough of this
I've had quite enough (Seen enough)
Seen enough (Seen enough of this)

We got dead-eyed, dead drunk dead stupid cyberpunks
Fed-up killer geeks gigabyte meth freaks
Home alone in a world of their own
Up all night in the thick of the fight
Fantasy combat, veteran psychos
Removed from reality by silicon diodes

I've seen enough (Seen enough)
I have seen enough of this
Have you read enough? (Seen enough)
Son, you don't know nothin' about it (Seen enough of this)

You got powerbook potentates pointedly obviate
Every opinion they have about anything
Even if they don't know shit
Stay in the limelight, got your own website
Got all the answers, ain't got a lick of sense
Practicing psychiatry without a license

Ain't you seen enough, hey (Seen enough)
Had enough of this
I have had enough (Seen enough)
Ain't it bad enough for you yet? (Seen enough of this)
(Seen enough, seen enough of this)

So you got overfed talking heads on television
Ignoring the obvious with pained expressions
Ask the ones that sell the damn guns
By the truckload every day, fast as they can make 'em
What's a kid s'posed to think when the adults
Refuse all accountability when they fuck up

Ain't you seen enough, hey (Seen enough)
Ain't you had enough of this (Seen enough of this)
Goddam tired enough (Seen enough)
Have we done enough about this? (Seen enough of this)
