You know you are a friend of mine
Babe, you been gone an awful long time
You might remember me
I tried to set your soul free

Glad that you got it made
When did you finalize your last trade?
You are the only one
I've ever seen do what you got done (You are the only one)
Anything that you done done (You are the only one)
You are the only one
Don't put me under your gun

I'm gonna be missing you
Even though I understand that you're not through
Go on, take it day by day
Seems like I lost you anyway

Glad that you got it made
When did you finalize your last trade?
You are the only one
That I've ever seen do what you done done (You are the only one)
Anything that you done done (You are the only one)
You are the only one
Don't put me under your gun
You might also like
When you came to save the world
I caused your dreams to fade
I couldn't do what you did
And rained on your parade

(Glad that you got it made)
(Glad that you got it made)
Hard set of changes
For anyone that I know (Glad that you got it made)
You're gonna make it, make it
Make it better for you and me (Glad that you got it made)
Anyone else you know
Just don't forget me (Glad that you got it made)
I'll be there when you're done (Glad that you got it made)
And in the meantime, meantime
You'll get to know yourself (Glad that you got it made)
So don't judge anyone else, anyone
Oh oh

It doesn't matter, I don't mind
I know that you'll remember sometime
Even if you never do
All you need to worry 'bout now is you
Glad that you got it made
When did you finalize your last trade?
You are the only one
That I've ever seen do what you done done (You are the only one)
Anything that you done done (You are the only one)
You are the only one
Don't put me under your gun

Glad that you got it made
Glad that you got it made
