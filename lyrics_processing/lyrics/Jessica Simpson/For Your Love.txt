Oh

You are every part of me
And with every breath I take
Your love will light my way
And for every day I live
The promise that I made
Is I will never let you go, babe

I swear I never knew love like this before
And for everything you are
I gotta make you know

For your love
I'd give anything for your love (For your love, yeah)
'Cause baby, I'll never make it alone (No)
And forever, I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see, yeah
I only live for your love

When I was running out of faith
You still believed in me, yeah
And never let me fall
And the times I lost my way
You're the one who held me up
And brought me through it all, yeah
You might also like
I swear I never saw it like this before
'Cause baby, with your love you gave me
The reason to go on

And for your love
I'd give anything for your love (For your love, yeah)
'Cause baby, I'll never make it alone (Don't ya know?)
And forever, I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see, yeah
I only live for your love, babe
Ohh yeah

And everything I am
And all that I could be
Would mean nothing now
If you're not with me
Shining your light on me when night is closing in, oh
When I was weak, you were the one who made me strong
You gave me faith to carry on, ohh

And I'd give anything for your love (I'd give anything, no)
'Cause baby, I'll never make it alone (I'll never make it alone)
And forever, I'll stand by your side
I just gotta make you see, yeah
I wanna live for your love
Wanna sing for your love
Wanna give your your love
I'd give anything for your love (Whoa, oh)
'Cause baby, I'll never make it alone (Oh-oh, yeah yeah)
