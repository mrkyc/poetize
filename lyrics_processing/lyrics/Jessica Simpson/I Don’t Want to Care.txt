Mm, oh

Here's another day
Another girl left so confused
Trying to find a way
In the common likes of you
But you're so undecided
Stringing me along
And it hurts just thinkin' 'bout
One day you're here and then you're gone

Nothing to say, won't hesitate
Can't walk away from you
You weren't there, when I was scared
Now all that I wanna do is forget about love

So, I don't wanna care about love
No, I don't wanna care about us
I don't wanna care at all anymore (No, no)
I used to only care a little bit
But now I care way too much
Now this love thing, I wish I never felt it before
I don't wanna care
Anymore
You might also like
Tryna brace myself
For the fall 'cause you didn't catch me
Promised that you would
Hold me tight, be the one I need
But I stood waiting for you to come give me a ride
Back to what love's supposed to be
I guess that was a lie

You were there now, I don't how
I could have fallen so deep
'Cause you weren't here to wipe all my tears
Erase you from my memories
I don't wanna care

So, I don't wanna care about love
No, I don't wanna care about us
I don't wanna care at all anymore (No, no)
I used to only care a little bit
But now I care way too much
Now this love thing, I wish I never felt it before
I don't wanna care

All my precious time
Now I can't get it back
So lost and alone
And I can't take feeling like that
Baby, I've had enough
I just wanna move on
Don't wanna look back
'Cause I know I've gotta be strong
I don't wanna care about love
Anymore
I don't wanna care about us
I don't wanna care about love

So, I don't wanna care about love
No, I don't wanna care about us (Oh yeah)
I don't wanna care at all anymore, no, no (Anymore, yeah, yeah)
I used to only care a little bit (Oh)
But now I care way too much (Way too much)
Now this love thing, I wish I never felt it before
Well, I don't wanna care (I don't wanna care)
So, I don't wanna care about us (About us)
(No, no) I don't wanna care about us
I don't wanna at all anymore (Oh, oh, no, no)
I used to only care a little bit (A little bit, a little bit)
But now I care way too much
Now this love thing, I wish I never felt it before
I don't wanna care
Anymore
