Hey, oh

I was counting down minutes
I was wishin' on the stars
I was prayin' for a sign
And tryin' to beat the odds
I was dreamin' of you
Love, before I saw your face
And there you were
Waitin' for that day
When you reached through the hurricane
When you, baby, you called my name

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby, you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
Where the hero belongs
There you were, there you were
Oh, oh
You might also like
Must have broken into heaven
Just to roll back the clouds
Were you on a mission?
Were you seeking me out?
Was I that one in a million?
Was I that one sacred kiss
That you couldn't chance
You just couldn't miss?
Then you whispers through the silent tears
When you, you swept away all my fears

You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby, you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
Where the hero belongs
There you were, babe

Standin' in the middle of nowhere
With your arms wide open and you
You were the reason
When there was no reason in my life
You're the reason in my life
You broke through the storm (Oh)
And you turned back the night
Baby, you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
There you were, babe (Oh)
You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby, you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
Where the hero belongs
There you were, oh, hero
Yeah

Like the light in the eye of the storm (Mmm)
Tellin' me not to cry anymore (There you were)
Where I watched my whole world fall apart (Oh baby)
Shinin' through like an angel from afar (Oh, like an angel)
You broke through the storm (Oh)
And you turned back the night
Baby, you are the fire
Burnin' the midnight sky
And your love
Keeps taking me higher
Just when all hope was gone
There you were, babe (Oh)
You broke through the storm
And you turned back the night
Baby, you are the fire
