Ya'll ain't ready for this
Swing with me, baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby

Baby, let's start to swing
Skirt flyin' high while you're twistin' me
Shuffle, boy, to your knees
Work those hands, you start ruffling
Feel these legs moving, baby
Rub 'em up and down 'til they drive you crazy
Don't stop, just give it to me
Do the Do-Wah-Diddy, baby
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy

When I feel your body up close to me
Steamin' up, can you feel the friction when I
Pull my hips, baby, bend me, please
Can ya stand the heat comin' from the kitchen?
Turn you on like an old Durpix
Baby, rev you up when I turn the key
Normally I don't like to tease
But, baby, tonight, just swing with me
You might also like
Swing with me, baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Shake it for me, honey
Work it like you want me
Bass hits the floor and the room's vibratin'
Straight through my hips and I start gyratin'
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby

It's like a hundred degrees
Sweat draws you close like honey to bees
Your clothes are soakin' wet
And you ain't felt nothin' yet (Oh damn)
Tension just starts to grow
As I'm spinnin' and my bloomers show
Baby, come on and give it to me
Do the Do-Wah-Diddy, baby
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy

When I feel your body up close to me
Steamin' up, can you feel the friction when I
Pull my hips, baby, bend me, please
Can ya stand the heat comin' from the kitchen?
Turn you on like an old Durpix
Baby, rev you up when I turn the key
Normally I don't like to tease
But, baby, tonight, just swing with me
Swing with me, baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Shake it for me, honey
Work it like you want me
Bass hits the floor and the room's vibratin'
Straight through my hips and I start gyratin'
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby

Swing with me, baby (Swing with me, baby)
Swing with me, baby (Swing with me, baby)
Swing with me, baby (Swing with me, baby)
Swing, swing, swing with me, swing with me

When I feel your body up close to me
Steamin' up, can you feel the friction when I
Pull my hips, baby, bend me, please
