Oh-oh

When I see you there, I'm so aware
Of how lucky I am, baby
'Cause I don't deserve, I don't come close
To understanding, baby
The logic of your kind of trust
It amazes me
That someone like you would care enough
To just believe

Your faith in me
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
To hold on to
When I fall, when I'm weak
All the strength that I need is your faith, baby
Your faith in me, oh

Even when I fall, I get along
'Cause our love is real, baby
It's like salvation to my soul
'Cause that's how it feels, baby
It's a sacred thing that I keep close
To carry on
And I know that I will be alright
And you'll heal it all
You might also like
Your faith in me
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
To hold on to
When I fall, when I'm weak
All the strength that I need is your faith, baby
Your faith in me

You make me feel I could walk on water
(I could reach above the stars)
And nothing comes against me
Safe within your arms

Your faith in me
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
To hold on to
When I fall, when I'm weak
(When I fall, baby)
All the strength that I need is your faith, baby
Your faith in me
When I fall, baby
When I'm weak, baby
All I need, baby
Is your faith in me (All I need is your faith in me)
When I fall, baby (Ooh)
When I'm weak, baby
All I need, baby
Is your faith in me (All I need is your faith in me)
When I fall, baby
When I'm weak, baby
All I need, baby
Is your faith in me (Oh yeah)
When I fall, baby
When I'm weak, baby (When I'm weak, baby)
All I need, baby (Is your faith in me)
