I belong to me
Ooh, yeah
Oh

It's not that I don't wanna share my life with you, baby
It's just that I'm the one I need to be true to, baby
And I won't give up me to be part of you
It's not that I don't wanna have you in my life, baby
It's just you gotta know that it's got to be right, baby
Before I open up my heart to you

I don't need somebody to complete me
I complete myself
Nobody's got to belong to somebody else

I belong to me
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection
I belong to me
I'm one, not half of two
And if you're gonna love me
You should know this, baby
I belong to me
You might also like
I gotta let you know before I let you in, baby
That who I am is not about who I am with, baby
That don't mean I don't wanna be here with you
I do

I don't need somebody to complete me
I want you to know
I'll give all my love, but I'm not givin' up my soul

I belong to me (Me)
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection (Oh)
I belong to me (I belong to me)
I'm one, not half of two
And if you're gonna love me
You should know this, baby
I belong to me (Ooh yeah)

Love don't mean changin' who you are to be
Who somebody wants you to be
Nobody's got to belong to nobody
I belong to me
I don't belong to you
My heart is my possession
I'll be my own reflection, oh

I belong to me (I belong to me)
I don't belong to you (Don't belong to you)
My heart is my possession (Oh)
I'll be my own reflection (Baby)
I belong to me
I'm one, not half of two (One, not half of two)
And if you're gonna love me (If you're gonna love me)
You should know this, baby
