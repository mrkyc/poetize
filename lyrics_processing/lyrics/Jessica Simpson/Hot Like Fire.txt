Jessica, you are never going to believe what I am looking at right now
What are you talking about?
You know your man? Mr. Wonderful?
The guy you're always talking about?
I know, he's so hot, right?
Yeah, hot, whatever
Ok, anyways, he is all up on that girl, Coop
Coop? What are you talking about? (Laughs)
Yes, I'm telling you girl, he's playing you
Whatever
Jessica, I'm serious
He is all over her! Believe...
Whatever, I don't believe you
Jess, I swear it's true
I was watching 'em, I can see 'em right now
It's so disgusting
You guys....
I'm serious, you better call him up right now
What do I do? What do I say?
I don't know, but I'm looking at him
I mean, you gotta tell him the truth
You gotta tell him how it is
He's playing me?
He's playing you so bad
(Sighs)
You might also like
You told me that you would always be the only thing that I'd ever need
Telling all my friends that they were never good enough to be with me
You want me to stay at home
And like a fool, I did for you
Now I see the game that you played on me, oh

You go out with your friends at night like it's alright
'Cause you're hot like fire
Other girls call you your cell phone
Boy, you can't help yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
You didn't know she was by best friend, baby
You just played yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
Baby, don't try to run your game on me
'Cause it's plain to see that you're hot like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire

You said you loved me, baby
And never will fall apart
You even told me once that you suffered from a broken heart
And made plans to share a summer romance
A dream for two, just me and you
But now I see what you're really about, oh
You go out with your friends at night like it's alright
'Cause you're hot like fire
Other girls call you your cell phone
Boy, you can't help yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
You didn't know she was by best friend, baby
You just played yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
Baby, don't try to run your game on me
'Cause it's plain to see that you're hot like fire

Fire, like fire, like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire
Fire, like fire, like fire

Oh, tell me who'd you think I was
Did you think I was your fool?
Maybe you've taken other girls for a ride before
But I got your number
See baby, I can play your game
And you can tell me how it feels
'Cause everything you're ever done to me
Can be done right back to you!
{PHONE RINGS}
"Hello?"

Baby, you thought you could play me
Thought that you could make a little move and fake me
See honey, I don't need to be
Just another quick notch your on your belt, not me
I'll never be a prize on your shelf
A real player, you'll never be
You need to run your game on someone else instead of me
Look at you now, poor baby
You're so through
So tell me how it feels
Now that someone is playing you

You go out with your friends at night like it's alright
'Cause you're hot like fire
Other girls call you your cell phone
Boy, you can't help yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
You didn't know she was by best friend, baby
You just played yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
Baby, don't try to run your game on me
'Cause it's plain to see that you're hot like fire
You go out with your friends at night like it's alright
'Cause you're hot like fire
Other girls call you your cell phone
Boy, you can't help yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
You didn't know she was by best friend, baby
You just played yourself
'Cause you're hot like fire
Baby, don't try to run your game on me
