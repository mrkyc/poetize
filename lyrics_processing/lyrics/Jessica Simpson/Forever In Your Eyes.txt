Forever in your eyes

Eyes like fire
Burn desire
As we dance away into the night
This attraction
Fuels a passion
That's just too strong for us to try and fight

Each moment we're together
I just never want to end
'Cause I could never feel this way again

'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night
I never thought I'd ever realize
A love that feels so close to paradise
Boy, I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes
You might also like
Lips so tender, I surrender
Everything I am is yours alone
'Cause when you touch me, all that I see
Are feelings that my heart has never known

You're all I ever dreamed of, you're my every fantasy
Whoever thought an angel could bring heaven here to me

'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night
I never thought I'd ever realize
A long that feels so close to paradise
Boy, I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes

You're the one my heart beats for
You're my everything and more
It's a burning love I can't seem to ignore
'Cause all the things I feel inside
Are too strong for me to hide, baby
I need you by my side
'Cause I could live forever in your eyes
'Cause nothing else had ever felt so right
To feel your body lying next to mine (Oh baby)
As the rhythm of your heart beats through me
All through the night (Oh yeah, all through the night)
I never thought I'd ever realize
A love that feels so close to paradise
Boy, I could spend my whole life living
Forever in your eyes

Forever in your eyes
Forever in your eyes
Forever in your eyes
Forever in your eyes
Forever in your eyes (Oh)
