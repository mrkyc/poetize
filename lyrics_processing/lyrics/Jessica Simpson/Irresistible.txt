(Ooh) You know
I don't know what it is (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
But everything about you is so irresistible

Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire (With desire)
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait (Oh)
Let him think I like the chase (Oh)
But I can't stop fanning the fire (Oh)
I know I meant to say, "no"

But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
Oh, I can hardly breathe (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right?
That I should really say goodnight
But I just can't stop myself falling (Falling)
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
(That I don't wanna) I don't wanna play no game (No)
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me (Oh)
I know I meant to say, "no" (I meant to say, "no")
You might also like
But he's irresistible (Irresistible)
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual (Oh, oh yeah)
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

Can't you see?
Whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
He's so irresistible
Baby, you know it's more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful
He's so irresistible (He's so irresistible)

But he's irresistible (Yeah yeah)
Up close and personal (Oh yeah)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical (Oh yeah), deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
He's irresistible
Up close and personal (Yeah)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (Irresistible to me)
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
