Mmm
Way it's gonna
Way it's gonna

Lately, I find I'm caught up in these thoughts
How will you come to me?
How will we connect these hearts?
Are you somewhere near?
Hidden like a four-leaf clover
Are you miles away?
Are we getting any closer? (Are we getting any closer?)

I already see us moving mountains
I already see us walk on water
I already see the clouds we're flying
Over and under
I can really see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
I already see us moving mountains
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
I already see us walk on water
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
You might also like
Being with you is a like a scene from a dream in heaven
I feel you running through
All my senses
Will you taste like rain?
Can I breathe you like air?
Will I lose myself in your arms somewhere?

I already see us moving mountains
I already see us walk on water
I already see the clouds we're flying
Over and under
I can really see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be

And I know and I know and I know
Love can move a mountain
And I know and I know
It's gonna be even better than I imagined
Putting all my trust in you
Putting all my trust in you
We'll make this dream come true
I can really see us having babies
Walking through the park and being lazy
I already see myself falling in love eternally
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
And I think that's just the way it's gonna be
I already see us moving mountains
Ooh, the way it's gonna be
I already see us walk on water
The way it's gonna be
I can really see us having babies
The way it's gonna be
I already see myself falling in love
Meant to be
I already see us moving mountains
The way it's gonna be
I already see us walk on water (To me)
The way it's gonna be
I can really see us having babies
