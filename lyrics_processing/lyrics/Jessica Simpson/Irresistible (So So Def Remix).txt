Uh-huh
Ha, ha
Sing for me

Ooh, you know (What?)
I don't know what it is (Haha, it's the remix)
But everything about you is so irresistible
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Fo' sho' (So So Def)
It's the 2K top dog (Uh)
Don't nobody want it
I got 10K on it, I'm the hottest thing out (Hottest thing out)
If you look at me, you're lookin' at a kid with a plan (Uh-huh)
If you don't understand, homie, check Soundscan
So So Def to grain
You know our motto (Uh-huh, uh)
In the street throwing paper like we just won the lotto, ow!
Guest on the beat, like dubs hit on the six
Irresistible to all chicks
Listen to the remix

Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type (Uh)
To hide what I feel inside (Come on)
When he makes me weak with desire (Desire) (Oh)
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait (Oh) (Uh-huh)
Let him think I like the chase (Oh)
But I can't stop fanning the fire (Oh)
I know I meant to say no
(Uh, uh, uh, hand clap, oh)
You might also like
But he's irresistible (Uh-huh)
Up close and personal (That's right)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual (Uh-huh)
His ways are powerful (Uh-huh)
Irresistible to me
Oh, I can hardly breathe (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, Jessica, come on)

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right (Oh)
That I should really say goodnight (Uh-huh, I like that)
But I can't stop myself from falling (Falling)
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
(That I don't wanna) That I don't wanna play no game (No)
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me (Still wait)
I know I meant to say, "no" (I meant to say, "no")
(Clap your hands, oh)

But he's irresistible (Irresistible)
Up close and personal (Uh-huh)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual (Oh, yeah) (Yeah)
His ways are powerful (Uh-huh)
Irresistible to me (Uh-huh)
Whenever he's close to me (Break)
I really find it hard to breathe  (Ooh, uh-huh)
He's so irresistible (This is the part where you all clap)
Baby, you know it's more than just spiritual (Yo, hear you turn it up to like, ten)
His kisses are powerful (You just let it go, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
He's so irresistible (You're so irresistible)
(Like that, oh)

But he's irresistible (Yeah yeah)
Up close and personal (Oh yeah) (Yeah)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe) (Oh)
More than just physical (Oh yeah), deeper than spiritual (Uh-huh)
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

He's irresistible
Up close and personal (Yeah) (Yeah)
Now inescapable (All I wanna do it make is y'all dance)
I can hardly breathe (Irresistible to me)
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual (Wave your hands, stomp your feet, all that, ha, ha)
His ways are powerful (Hey)
