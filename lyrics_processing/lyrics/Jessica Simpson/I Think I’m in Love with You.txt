Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Every time you're near, baby
I get kinda crazy in my head for you
And I don't know what to do
And, oh, baby
I get kinda shaky when they mention you
I just lose my cool

My friends tell me
Something has come over me
And I think I know what it is
I think I'm in love

Boy, I think that I'm in love with you
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you (In love)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (Oh, I think I'm in love)
I been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

Just the other night, baby
I saw you hanging, you were with your crew
I was with mine too
You took me by surprise
When you turned and looked me in my eyes
Boy, you really blew my mind
You might also like
I don't know what's gotten into me
But I kinda think I know what it is
I think I'm in love

Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (In love)
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you (I'm in love)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (I'm in love)
I been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you
Got me tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

Something strange has come over me
Got me goin' out of my mind
Never met a guy like you before
You make me feel special inside
I think I'm in love

Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (Oh, yeah)
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you (I think I'm in love)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (In love with you)
I been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you (What I feel)
(See, I) Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (Ah, in love with you)
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you
(Goin' out of my mind, boy)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (I think I'm in love)
I been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you

(Baby, every time you call my name)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (You're drivin' me insane)
Got me doin' silly things when it comes to you (Doin' silly things for you)
(I don't know what to do)
Boy, I think that I'm in love with you (Never met a guy like you)
