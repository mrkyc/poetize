Yeah, hey
Oh-oh, yeah
Yeah, hey
Oh yeah

I'm not the kind of girl to sit out on sidelines (Sidelines)
The kind of girl who doesn't say it straight from her mind (Her mind)
You're gonna know all that I'm feeling on the inside (Inside)
I ain't into games, I don't wanna waste
Any time and all the energy we could spend (Spend)
Being together, boy
Forever, you're my best friend (Best friend)
I got a little problem that I can't mend (I can't mend)
You been taking me for granted, you

I don't wanna walk away from what we have, and you know it
I'm not telling you all of this to make you mad
It's not about who's right or wrong
It's not about who's weak or strong
It's about what I need to make this last

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say (They say)
A little bit goes a long way
A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby, at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way
You might also like
I need your heart
I need your love

Don't wanna end up in a tricky situation (Situation)
So I'm giving you my every indication (Indication)
We can work it out together, stop the tension (Tension)
Try to understand
Baby, where I stand
I love you and I'm trying to be gentle (Gentle)
So let me break it down for you, make it simple (Simple)
I gave my heart and soul to you, now it's essential (A little bit)
That you show a little love for me

I don't wanna walk away or let you go, and you know it (You know)
I'm not telling you all of this to make you sad
It's not about the tears we cry
It's about how hard we try
To give a little more, and see the other side

A little more time, a little less wait (Oh yeah)
A little more heart, a little less break (Oh yeah)
Simple and true, what they say (They say)
A little bit goes a long way
A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby, at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way
And it hurts me
'Cause I care and I'm telling you why
I'm unhappy, so if you love me
A little bit is not that much to ask to make things right
Oh yeah, oh yeah
A little bit goes a long, long way

A little bit, a little bit (Yeah)
A little bit goes a long way (Oh yeah)
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit goes a long way
(A little bit goes a long, long way)

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say (They say)
A little bit goes a long way (A little bit goes a long, long way)
A little less talk, a little more do (More do)
A little more me, a little less you
Baby, at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way (A little bit goes a long, long way)
A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break (Oh, hey, yeah)
Simple and true, what they say (They say)
A little bit goes a long way
A little less talk, a little more do (No, no, oh no)
A little more me, a little less you
Baby, at the end of the day
