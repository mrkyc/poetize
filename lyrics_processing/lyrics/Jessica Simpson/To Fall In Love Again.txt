So faithfully
Holding tight to every dream I thought our love would ever be
As the scent of hope slips through my fingers
Plain for me to see
I can feel now in your eyes the changing way you look at me
Where's the love we knew would last us eternally?

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby?
Please don't turn your back and just pretend
That your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me
Can we find a way to fall in love again?

It's hard for you
When your heart has opened up to feelings that you never knew
Never thinking that you'd doubt our love
You don't know what to do
I'd give anything, my heart, my soul if I could pull you through
Just to find again the love we hold so true

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby?
Please don't turn your back (Baby, please) and just pretend
That your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me (And your soul)
Can we find a way to fall in love again?
You might also like
And as every night goes by
With every lonely tear I cry
It's so clear to me
I need you by my side

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby?
Please don't turn your back (Baby, please) and just pretend
Oh, that your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me (And your soul)
Can we find a way to fall in love again?
Can we find a way to fall in love again?

Oh baby, I need you to love me for the rest of my life
If we fall in love again, would you love me for the rest of my life?
If we fall in love again, oh-oh
If we fall in love again, would you love me for the rest of my life?
If we fall in love again, oh yeah
If we fall in love again
Oh baby, would you love me if we fall in love again? (Oh-oh)
If we fall in love again
If we fall in love again
