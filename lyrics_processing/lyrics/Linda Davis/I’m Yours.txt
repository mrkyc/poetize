My guard is down
I'm in a place I'd never dream
Mmm
I've heard it happens everyday
Well, it's my turn dare I say
Whoa, look at me
I've never been so taken in
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up
In a feeling
My heart can't ingore
This is what I've been waiting for
Baby, I'm yours
I laid my heart out on the line
Now I know it was worth the risk
Mmm
'Cause when I see you smile
I just fall
I surrender all
And I just can't resist
You might also likeI've never been so taken in
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up
In a feeling
My heart can't ingore
This is what I've been waiting for
Oh, baby, I'm yours
I had to let my heart go
Due to circumstances
Beyond my control
I've never been so taken in
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'd get caught up
In a feeling
My heart can't ingore
This is what I've been waiting for
Whoa, baby, I'm yours
I've never been so taken in
This is a fight I cannot win
Oh, baby, I'm yours
This is what I've been waiting for
Whoa, baby, I'm yours
My hopes are up
My guard is down
I'm in a place I've never dreamed
I've heard it happens everyday
It's my turn, dare I say
Look at me
Chorus
Oh I've never been so taken in
This is a fight I cannot win
I'm yours
Take me as I am
And I never thought I'm get caught up
In a feeling my heart can't ignore
This is what I've been waiting for
Baby I'm yours
I laid my heart
Out on the line
Now I know it was worth the risk
When I see you smile I just fall
I surrender all
I can't resist
I had to let my heart go
