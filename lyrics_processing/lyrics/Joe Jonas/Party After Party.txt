Oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Roll out, downtown
Crash the warehouse
Making my way through the crowd
Where's the DJ?

Hit the...
Playback on my new track
Before we jet back to the crash bad (Blast that!)
Ch'mon at ten, me and my friends
At my place gettin' crazy

Don't bring ya money
Just bring ya body
All night long (Party after party)
Ready or not
You're not gonna stop
We're gonna shake the town up (Party after party)

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh (Rock 'til ya drop!)
Party after party
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh ('Til the sun comes up)
Party after party
You might also like
We take five to sunset
From the valley
We make a quick stop to fill up
Bumpin' to Chelsea (Bumpin' to Chelsea)
Hear the ringtone
On my bro's phone
I'm gonna meet them at the Troubadour
Front door
Kings of Leon playin' my song
I'm gonna use somebody
Through the break of dawn

Don't bring ya money
Just bring ya body
All night long (Party after party)
Ready or not
You're not gonna stop
We're gonna shake the town up (Party after party)

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh (Rock 'til ya drop!)
Party after party
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh ('Til the sun comes up)
Party after party
We don't want
This night to end
So let's
Keep goin'
Only got
One life to live
So let's
Keep rollin'
We don't want
This night to end
So let's
Keep-going
Only got
One life to live
So let's go!
Party after party after party after party

Don't bring ya money
Just bring ya body
All night long (Party after party)
Ready or not
You're not gonna stop
We're gonna shake the town up (Party after party)
Don't bring ya money
Just bring ya body
All night long (Party after party)
Ready or not
You're not gonna stop
We're gonna shake the town up (Party after party)
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
(Rock 'til ya drop!)
Party after party (Rock 'til ya drop!)
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
('Til the sun comes up)
Party after party
('Til the sun comes up)
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
(Rock 'til ya drop!)
