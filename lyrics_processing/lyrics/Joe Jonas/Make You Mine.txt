Talk bad, walk bad, tear the place up
Work bad, my damn eyes are on ya
You got somethin' all the guys want
And I just wanna get to know ya
Don't quit, keep this goin' on all night
Shake that, hey, that body's so right, oh
You got somethin' all the guys like
And I just wanna get to know ya

Tell me what you want and I'll give it
Just as long as you know where we're headed
Back to my place when it's all over, oh-oh
That's when I'm sober, baby

Oh-oh, so gonna make you mine tonight
I wanna rock with you 'til sunrise, can I?
Let me do all the little things you like

Ooh-wee, tell me, what is your name?
All I know is I'm lovin' that frame, oh
Everything about you drives me insane
And I just wanna get to know ya
You might also like
'Cause all that I see when I am looking at you
Is all the crazy things I wanna do
Let me get close to you and I'll show all you need and more, oh

Oh-oh, so gonna make you mine tonight, night
I wanna rock with you 'til sunrise, can I?
Let me do all the little things you like
Oh-oh, so will you let me blow your mind, mind?
Want you to have the time of your life, can I?
Let me do all the little things you like

I wanna rock with you 'til sunrise, can I?
Let me do all the little things you like

Game zone, let me know, baby, we can take it slow
If you wanna, let me know, we'll go, oh
Now I don't know who you are, but you shine like a star
If you let me, I can take you so far and, baby, now

Oh-oh, so gonna make you mine tonight (Make you mine)
I wanna rock with you 'til sunrise, can I?

Oh-oh, so will you let me blow your mind?
Want you to have the time of your life, can I?

Whatever you wanna do, baby, it's up to you
