He's reaching out, but she cannot hear
Through all the stars that are far and near
He wants the noise to disappear, yeah yeah

You've got that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life, young and reckless

When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless, yeah, yeah
You've got that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life, young and reckless
But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless
