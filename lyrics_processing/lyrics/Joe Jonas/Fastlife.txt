I don't really know what you're thinkin' (Thinkin')
But I know what we're drinkin' (Drinkin')
Let me put your night in drive
Cat walkin' on the runway (Runway)
Trippin' long on the highway (Highway)
Goin' home is only right, yeah

Can't see nothin' but blurred lines (Hey, hey, hey)
Actin' like it's your first time (Hey, hey, hey)
Girl, I'm done with these games and you need to get in my lane
Pushing it to the red line (Hey, hey, hey)

Girl, you know that you want it
And you know where we're goin' (Girl, get in my)
Girl, you know where we're goin'
And you know that you want it (Girl, get in my ride, girl, get in my ride, girl, get in my)

Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fastlife?
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fastlife?

When I'm in the streets, I'm speedin' (Speedin')
In the sheets, no reason (Reason)
Lookin' in your eyes, I see the signs
Put the start up, louder than a siren (Siren)
Then we focus on silence (Silence)
Then go on another ride

Can't see nothin' but blurred lines (Hey, hey, hey)
Acting like it's your first time (Hey, hey, hey)
Girl, I'm done with these games (These games), and you need to get in my lane (My lane)
Pushing it to the red line (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Girl, you know that you want it (Want it)
And you know where we're goin' (Girl, get in my, here we go)
Girl, you know where we're goin' (Goin')
And you know that you want it (Girl, get in my ride, girl, get in my ride, girl, get in my)

Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fastlife? (Ooh, baby)
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fastlife?
Turn the lights out, put the top down
Are you ready for the fastlife?

Girl, you know that you want it
And you know where we're goin' (Girl, get in my)
