Let's go
Hey, hey, hey
Let's go

Baby, so happy that you made it out tonight
With the way you look under these lights
You're the brand new owner of my eyes, my eyes
I know, I know, many men have tried and failed before

And baby, I'm pretty sure that tonight's the night will change your life
Grab my hand, watch us fly

So many things I can't wait to show ya (Hey)
So many things I can't wait to show ya (Hey)
Give me the chance to get to know ya (Hey)
Say, "Yes" before the night is over

Here's our chance, let's take it and run, take it and run (Hey)
Here's our chance, let's take it and run, take it and run (Hey)
Take it and run (Take it and run)

Baby, you take my breath with every step with every move
How you do it, I have no clue
But, girl, I cannot lie, I'm so into you (Oh-oh-oh, baby)
I promise if you give this a try, you'll be more than satisfied

So, open the door, let me in
Brand new life, let's begin

So many things I can't wait to show ya (Hey)
So many things I can't wait to show ya (Hey)
Give me the chance to get to know ya (Hey)
Say, "Yes" before the night is over
So many things I can't wait to show ya (Hey)
So many things I can't wait to show ya (Hey)
Give me the chance to get to know ya
Say, "Yes" before the night is over

Here's our chance, let's take it and run, take it and run (Oh, hey)
Here's our chance, let's take it and run, take it and run (Hey)
Take it and run
Here's our chance, let's take it and run, take it and run
Take it and run
