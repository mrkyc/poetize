I know you've been hurt before
But never say never, baby
Slow down, don't close the door
You've been waiting forever, baby
See, I know your heart's been scarred
But you've come this far, so baby, don't run away
I, I know you're close to giving up
I just wanna give you love and try to keep a smile on your face

So open your eyes and see that we belong together, hey, yeah
Pleasant surprise, you'll find that things can be much better, yeah

I wanna take you to a place where love is something more than you imagined, yeah
I put it right in your face, girl, it's yours, all you gotta do is reach out and grab it
You waited all this time, you waited all this time
I put it right in your face, girl, it's yours, all you gotta do is reach out and grab it

You played your cards right into the broken heart
Baby, I would never, I'd treat you like a treasure
It's not your fault, I know you took it hard
That was his mistake, for us, it's never too late
You can't live your life in fear, I know it's hard to move on
But you've just gotta forget it
