It can be a rush, yeah, it's like a drug
When you give up love, it's never worth it
When you're fightin' fear, it can be so clear
What you really need is each other

But I, I finally found the truth, I was using you
Every night you're gone, I swear it hurts
You're the atmosphere, oh, now you're gone, I can't live
Tell me what to do, I feel pain all over my body

Was it the things I said? Can I take them back, baby?
'Cause without you, there's nothin' left of me
We can run away, we can change our fate, baby
What can I do to show you I'm sorry?

Oh, what can I do to show you I'm sorry?

You were in a rush, you forgot your stuff
Said you'd had enough, now I feel worthless
The only thing I had was a second chance
What I really need is another
You might also like
But I, I finally found the truth, yeah, I was using you
Every night you're gone, I swear it hurts
You're the atmosphere, oh, now you're gone, I can't live
Tell me what to do, I feel pain all over my body

Was it the things I said? Can I take them back, baby?
'Cause without you, there's nothin' left of me
We can run away, we can change our fate, baby
What can I do to show you I'm sorry? (Woah, I'm sorry, babe)

What can I do to show you I'm sorry?

Pullin' away, girl, my heart is out of place
I feel it killin' me, oh, I made a mistake
Girl, I promise I won't make the same mistake twice
Don't say (Don't say), "Bye"
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Yeah, what can I do to show you I'm sorry? (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, what can I do to show you I'm sorry?

Was it the things I said? Baby, tell me what I did, baby
Without you, there's nothin' left of me
Please tell me we can run away, we can change our fate
Baby, what can I do to show you I'm sorry?
What can I do to show you I'm sorry?
