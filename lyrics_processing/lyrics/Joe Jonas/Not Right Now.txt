Yeah
Yeah
Oh
Woo
Na-na-na

We used to laugh and cry
I used to give you all of my time
When we would say goodbye
I could see sadness in your eyes
And what will it take to get everything back okay?
'Cause I don't really wanna feel this way

If it's not too late, maybe we could change our fate
And undo all of our mistakes

We've come too far to give up (Not right now)
Can't go on 'cause you know I love you still (Not right now)
Baby, we can't give up now (Not right now)
No stranger to pain, I know how it feels (Not right now)

Hey, hey (Not right now)
Oh, oh (Not right now)
Hey, hey (Not right now)
You might also like
And where did we go wrong? (Na-na-na)
We went from love to not gettin' along (Na-na-na)
We fight until the early morn' (Na-na-na)
Made me not even wanna come home (Na-na-na)
But nowadays, I sit and reminisce about us, babe
'Cause everything I miss about us, baby

If it's not too late, maybe we could change our fate
And undo all of our mistakes

We've come too far to give up (Not right now)
Can't go on 'cause you know I love you still (Not right now)
Baby, we can't give up now (Not right now)
No stranger to pain, I know how it feels (Not right now)
We've come too far to give up (Not right now)
Can't go on 'cause you know I love you still (Not right now)
Baby, we can't give up now (Not right now)
No stranger to pain, I know how it feels (Not right now)

Never thought it would be this way (Not right now)
Do everything just to make you stay (Not right now)
Tomorrow I'll give you up, not today (Not right now)
Yeah, no one, wanna give you up
We've come too far to give up (Not right now)
Can't go on 'cause you know I love you still (Not right now)
Baby, we can't give up now (Not right now)
No stranger to pain, I know how it feels (Not right now)
We've come too far to give up (Not right now)
Can't go on 'cause you know I love you still (Not right now)
Baby, we can't give up now (Not right now)
No stranger to pain, I know how it feels (Not right now)
