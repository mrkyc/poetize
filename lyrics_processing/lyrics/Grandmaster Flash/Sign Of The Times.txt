Now listen up 'cause I got a little something to say
To educate you 'bout the life in the streets today
Now everybody's confused about what to do
And what this world is coming to!
Sign of the times
Can really blow your mind
Inflation rises every time that opportunity knocks
The rent's crazy for the house the size of a box
It's an arm and a leg to keep clothes on your back
The daily run, push and shove, you just can't hack
When payday comes around, you're gonna pick up your check
Your money never sees your pocket,  out on debt
Hinkcley shot the president, he had nothing to lose
Wanted Jodie to see him on the Eyewitness News
Cops shoot up all of the citizens
And find out the next day the guy's innocent
And young girls being raped and taken by force
While all the people getting married just to get divorced!
Sign of the times

And all the rich folks screaming they're underpaid
Daddy's in jail doing twenty to life
He has a family back home with five kids and a wife
Girls run away from home with no way to survive
She had to sell her body to stay alive
Nowadays on the trains and the buses you see
People fighting for seats with the elderly
Mama down by the bedside on her knee
So much crime it ain't safe for her to walk the street
Because times are hard, you either do it or die
You can run and ignore, but you can't hide!
Man, when is there ever gonna be peace?
The only way there's gonna be peace, man, is with God seated at the conference table, I'm tellin' you
We can work it out, we need a little bit of peace, love and unity
I don't know about that man, with all this time  gone by, it just ain't never gonna end
That's why it's time for all love to come together
And I hope it's soon or we'll all be lost

Politicians like to max and relax
Sayin' "Vote for me and I know what to tax"
Sipping on martinis with a little coke
And then the headline reads "Drug overdose"
Magazines expose our beauty queen
The American dream, what does it mean?
For 'tis of thee and our country
Don't take things as they appear to be
You see babies cry while their mothers sigh
Sweet land of liberty with spacious skies
We got actors running for president
So what the hell's going wrong with this government?
No hurt is worse than a mother's pain
When the love for her child goes down the drain
She's been used and abused but would never expect
That the child she birthed would give her no respect, huh!
Car dealer wanted to make quick cash
Tried to buy the coke you don't drink out of a glass
Nowadays kids are growing up too fast
Learning more in the street than they do in class
Dealing drugs on the corner at the age of ten
Ma said, "If you go to jail, you got to stay in"
Speeding in the fast lane, going no place
And when it's over, you'll see that it was all a waste
Found with a letter by your bedside
You ended your life, committed suicide
Mama's searching in the trash for bottles and cans
While her kids stood by with outstretched hands
While a man holds a dollar and  prays
In this land of the free, uh, and home of the brave
You see people getting shot over nickels and dimes
Don't you know that it's all a sign of the times?
