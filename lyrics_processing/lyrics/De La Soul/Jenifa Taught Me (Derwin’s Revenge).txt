Access to her code
Lovestruck was my mode
Took a look, dropped my textbook
Jenifa (Oh)
Breakfast, broke it fast
She was in my English class
Asked for notes, rocked my boat
Jenifa (Oh)
Jenny
Lost her favorite penny
So I gave her a dollar
She kissed me (And I hollered)
In a flash, the school bell rang
Jenny grabbed onto my hand
Took me home and said
"Trugoy, just swing and swing and swang"

The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the break, found her shape
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Transcripts showed more than flirt
"I Love Daisies" read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Marvelous, shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found a house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan, I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried, "Kick it!"
Posdnuos was in
Jenny
Only thought about Jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin
She said, "Let's try it in the bathroom"
But 'Dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan
And came back wrapped in Saran

Now wait a minute!
Little Derwin got something to show us that Jenny could never do
Listen
Hey, look at little Derwin! Look at him go! Look at him go!
Aw, baby

Positions, muscles flexed
Dove was lost in a gon-a-hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Notions soothed the mood
Dove was lost in De La Heaven
Screwed Plug Two, did the do
Jenifa, oh Jenny
Jenny
Teased my homeboy Granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool

No more, I dispatched
Was it Jimmy had met his match?
Or could it be the realization
All girls owned a Jenny?
For normal health, I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught
Don't flaunt that the candy is good
