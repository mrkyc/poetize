I tried to be the man you wanted, baby
But I guess it wasn't good enough
Now I'm sitting here all alone
Wondering what the deal is

She don't really wanna talk to me
'Cause she said that our love is done
She don't even wanna look my way
'Cause she said that I'm not the one
All she wanted was a faithful man
Who would tell her just what he felt
(Tried to tell you how I feel, baby)
Now she's found love in another man
So I'm left here all by myself
(She said)

She said that she would comfort you through anything
Where did she go? (Where did she go?)
She said that she would be right here
Never ever leave
Where did she go?
She said that she would comfort you
Through anything
Where did she go? (I don't know)
She said that she would be right here
Never ever leave
Where did she go? (I don't know where)
You might also like
I guess I'm gonna have to tell myself
There'll be better days ahead
And all I have to do is think about
All I had before she left
(Before she left me all alone)
She don't really wanna live alone
But she will if it brings me pain
And don't I wanna have to sacrifice my soul
Just to keep love the same
You know that she said

She said that she would comfort you through anything
Where did she go? (I wish I knew)
She said that she would be right here
Never ever leave
Where did she go? (She said)
She said that she would comfort you through anything
Where did she go?
She said that she would be right here
Never ever leave
Where did she go? (I don't know where)

(Like yesterday)
Like yesterday
She's gone away
(Can't believe it)
My life ain't the same (No, no, no)
('Cause you said, yeah)
She said that she would comfort you through anything
Where did she go?
She said that she would be right here
Never ever leave
Where did she go?
She said that she would comfort you through anything
Where did she go?
She said that she would be right here
Never ever leave
Where did she go?
She said that she would comfort you through anything
Where did she go?
She said that she would be right here
Never ever leave
Where did she go?
