I can put away the letters
Hide them in the drawer
I can even forget what you sent them for
And I can take your name out of my book
I can put away the pictures
I can put the dreams aside
But I just can't seem to put you out of my mind
So tell me now ohhhh
What do I do with the love, tell me baby
What do I do with the memories of
What do I do with the nights
Without you by my side
They used to be yours and mine
Without you what do I do with the love
(yeahh yeahh ohh ohhh)
I can go out every night now
Stay out till the dawn
Do whatever I want to anytime I want
And I can make believe we never met
I can clear out all the closets
Leave your things outside the door
But I just can't seem to not love you anymore

What do I do with the love
What do I do with the memories of
What do I do with the nights
Without you by my side
They used to be yours and mine
Without you what do I do with the love
What do I do with this heart
Who do I give it to
What do I do with these arms
If they're not holding you
What do I do with this time
If I'm not spending time with you
If I'm not giving my love to you
What do I do with the love
What do I do with the memories of
What do I do with the nights
Without you by my side
They used to be yours and mine
Without you what do I do with the love
What do I do with the love
What do I do with the love
What do I do with the love
Sitting here
