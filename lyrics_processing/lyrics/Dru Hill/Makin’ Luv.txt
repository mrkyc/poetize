It's 4 A.M
I'm leavin' you this message
To let you know that
I'm sittin' here watchin' this movie
And it's got me thinkin' 'bout you
And one more... thinkin' 'bout her
(Sing it for me Tao) C'mon

Girl you go me thinking 'bout your love
So many things I wanna do to you
So much pressure sticking out of me
It's coming out of me, and I need to be inside
(Need to be inside of you)
Won't you come and ride
Can't wait any longer
The feelings getting stronger
It's stronger I'm 'bout to explode

We should be making love (Oh baby I'm telling you)
We should be making love (That is what we gotta do)
Until we've both had enough (Sweatin' between the sheets ha)
We should be making love, making love (Ooh baby let's make love)
We should be making love (I'm telling you)
We should be making love (That is what we gotta do)
Until we've both had enough (Sweatin' between the sheets ha)
We should be making love, making love

I'm going crazy
Because I'm thinking 'bout that Vickie Secret thong, yeah
You had on the other day
When you came by my way
I wanted you to stay
I wanted to stop you at the door
Pull your dress off
Pull those panties down, your hand on the wall
And bend you over
And baby when I put it in
You're never gonna want me to stop

We should be making love
We should be making love (Makin' love)
Until we've both had enough (Had enough)
So we should be making love, making love (Makin' love)

Round and round
Up and down
Breathing out
