So So Def
If you wanna dance
I will make you dance
If you wanna move
I will make you move
Dru Hill come on
SISQO:
I got this feeling
And I can't turn it loose
That somebody else is getting next to you
Can't walk around
Like I was your fool
Cause being who I am
I can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me
About things going on
But deep in my heart baby
I hope that I'm wrong
DRU HILL:
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
(Somebody's sleepin' in my bed)
Sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
(Takin my place, Oh ho ho)

I come home early
Expecting your warm embrace
But something's wrong
Cause it's written on your face
(Written on your face)
Said it hurts so bad
When I walk through the door
But you know one thing
I ain't comin' back no more
Don't try to tell me
Things are still the same
Cause when we made love
I heard you call out his name
DRU HILL:
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
Sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
What do you want?
(What do you)
What do you need?
(What do you need)
Giving you everything plus my heart
I gave you the world
(Yes I did)
Cause you were my girl
(Oh yes I did)
But you still ran out on me
JD:
Uh, fly shit, different colors whips
I got plenty big hits
All kinda dips
Got too many
DA BRAT:
My life ain't complete
If I ain't got no buzz
And can't nobody do it like we does
It's a must brat bust any mic ya hand to me
And represent for the rest of the family
JD:
Well I'm known for makin' moves
On my own big songs
And now I keep it comin' strong
Till the early morn c'mon
DA BRAT:
Lemme interrupt
Your regular schedule
Twistin' off high levels of bubonic
Chokin' amateurs till they vomit
JD:
I make 'em sick cause I'm the williest
DA BRAT:
Too much for you to deal with
My ni**as that ride quick
Survive or die bitch
JD:
Why switch this remix hurts everyday
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill
Something you can feel
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill
What the deal?
DA BRAT:
Funkier than parliment
Stay bent behind tent
Keep ni**as payin' my rent
My goldier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers
JD:
We make believers out of dreamers
DRU HILL:
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
(Sleepin' in my bed)
Messin' with my head
(Messin' with my head)
Takin' my place
Sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
(Said I can't sleep baby)
Takin' my place
