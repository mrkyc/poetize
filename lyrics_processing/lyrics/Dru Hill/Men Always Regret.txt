In 1997, "Beauty" changed my life
Who would've known that she would be my future wife
Or the mother of a child so beautiful
What I had in love I lacked in self-control
See, I had to have them all to be satisfied
And on an average night, I'd take four or five
But the measure of a man ain't how many you can fuck
It's how you live your life so you can keep her trust

Men always regret getting over
'Cause you don't know what you do
So, you're better off loving her from the start
Even if your're not sure if she's loving you
Men always regret getting over
She'll hide her pain in her smile
And be in your bed sleeping with another man
While you're on the phone askin' 'bout your child

Remarkable, incredible, confrontational, yet irreplaceable
She wouldn't cook or clean, so I let her go (Oh no no)
But she's got the kind of love that you can't let go
But still I loved her unconditionally
I wish she had've told me that she didn't love me
Could have been better off on my own (Yes, I would)
But then I never would have wrote this song
You might also like
See, my girl is the kind that walks around with a smile
Kissin' and huggin' me like she don't even care, oh yeah
So one day, I come home
Smilin', ready to say "I love you"
But then I walked upstairs
And all your things were gone like you were never there

Men always regret getting over
'Cause you don't know what you do
So you're better off loving her from the start
Even if you think she ain't loving you, oh
Men always regret getting over
She'll hide her pain in her smile
So, while you're in the bed with another man
I just wanna talk to my child, yeah

Still can't understand
Why you let me get away with what I did
I don't wanna hurt another girl
Knowin' I was sleepin' with another girl
While you were home sleepin' in my bed
I really can't be mad if you turn around and do the same to me
Please, God, give me the strength
Men always regret getting over
'Cause one day she'll leave
Men always regret getting over
'Cause you don't know what you do
I could've been better off without ya, ha
But now I'm writing this song about ya, baby, hey hey, oh
Men always regret getting over
She'll hide her pain in her smile
I'm strong enough, ha; you can tell me the truth
Tell me the truth, baby
I'm a grown man and I can take the best you can
So baby, oh yeah
Men always regret getting over
'Cause you don't know what you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey, oh
Hey hey, said I'm gonna be alright
Men always regret getting over
