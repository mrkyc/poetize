Nah, nah, nah
Nah, this, this can't be true

I got this feeling, and I just can't turn it loose
That somebody's been getting next to you
I don't want to walk around knowing I was your fool
'Cause being the man that I am, I just can't lose my cool

My friends keep telling me about the things that's going on, babe
But deep in my heart, baby, I hope that I'm wrong
Yes, I hope I'm wrong but I know it, babe

Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
(In my bed, my bed, my bed)
Somebody's taking my place, baby
(Hey hey, baby)
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
And you know just what I mean, oh oh oh oh oh

I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something is wrong 'cause it's written all over your face
It hurt so bad when I walk through the door
But you know one damn thing, baby
I ain't coming back no more, no no no
You might also like
Now don't try to tell me things are still the same, yeah
'Cause when we made love, I heard you call out his name
Call out his name

Somebody's sleeping in my bed tonight, baby
Somebody's taking Sisqo's place, hey
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
Somebody's taking my place, yeah

Girl, I want you to know
I gave you money and every little thing that you need
I gave you the world (Yes, I did)
'Cause you were my girl (Oh, yes I did)
But you still ran out on me, oh yeah

Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
Said you're sleeping in my bed
Messin' with my head, ooh, baby
Somebody's taking my place
Oh, tell me why oh why oh why
Why oh why oh why
Why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
I said you're sleeping in my bed
Messin' with my head
Somebody's taking my place
Oh yeah, mmm
Now if you truly love me (Alright)
Then this would not be happening
Sleeping in my bed, messin' with my head
Oh no no no no, gotta let you go
(Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby)
Yes I do, baby, babe
(Somebody's taking my place)
Why'd you do it to me?
Why'd you do it?
I don't wanna be a fool no more
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
Somebody's taking my place
