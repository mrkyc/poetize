Can I talk to you for a second?
Got something I wanna say

I'm remembering in the first days
You would never ever leave me alone
But now it seems here lately, baby
That you are always gone
So tell me what am I suppose to do
Should I stay and wait for you?
My heart is slowly aching for your love
And I don't know what to do, so

Give me one good reason
I should stay
Your love is out of season
Be on your way
My eyes are tired of crying
So what are we gonna do?
So give me one good reason
Why I should stay with you

Our love is like an hourglass
You know we're running out of time
How could you go and do this to me
When you know it's messing with my mind?
(Messing with my mind)
I was there when you needed me
So why can't you see
I know you say that you love me, baby
But your friends, they come before me, so baby
You might also like
Give me one good reason
Ha, I should stay, oh yeah
Your love is out of season
Oh, be on your way, oh yeah
My eyes are tired of crying
So what are we gonna do? So, hey
So give me one good reason
Why I should stay, why I should stay

Ah yeah, yeah
I can't explain, no, no
How the joy that you gave to me has turned to pain
Ha, to pain, baby
See, I'm not gonna cry no more, baby (No)
I'm walking out the door, baby
There's one thing I know for sure
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

Give me one good, give me one good reason
Ooh, that I should stay
Your love is out of season
Ooh, be on your way
My eyes are tired of crying
So what are we gonna do, gonna do?
So give me one good reason
Tell me why I should stay
(Give me one good reason)
Hey, so give me one more reason
Why love is out of season
I'm tired of trying to please you
So that's why I'm leaving you
(Your love is out of season)
Why me? Why me, baby? Why me?
(My eyes are tired of crying)
