2 o'clock and I'm all alone
Callin' you on the phone
Wanna come over
But you ain't home
Get in my car and start to drive
Yes, I gotta take a ride
'Cause I feel lonely inside
But then I ran into your girlfriend
Know she is your best friend and
If we mess around our love will end
But I've got to take a sneak peek
'Cause the freak in me is beatin' me
Tellin' me to creep, see

I'm just wondering
If you really know what's goin' on
Do you really have a clue
'Bout what I'm gonna do to you?
Ay, I'm just wondering
If you really know what's goin' on
Do you really have a clue
'Bout what I'm gonna do to you?

Now that we're here alone
Had to unplug the phone
Just in case she called she think I'm not home
Had somethin' else to do
But now I'm here with you
What I had to do has turned into you
She thinks that I'm faithful
'Cause her ride is paid for
And I bought a crib for her and her shorty
Forbidden fruit is tasty
But you gotta lace me
I'm shady but you ain't worth my baby

Can you feel it, baby? Oh yeah
Can you feel it, baby?
Come on, baby
Come on, 'cause I'm wondering

I'm just wondering
If you really know what's goin' on
Do you really have a clue

Do you wanna go home with me?
