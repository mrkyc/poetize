Whispers passed in silence
Two lovers passing through the night
A love that's lived in darkness
That could never survive in light

What are we gonna do?
What are they gonna say?
Where are we gonna go
When they find out?
What are we gonna do?
What are they gonna say?
Where are we gonna go
When they find out?
(Nokio, sing your song, sing your song, sing your song)

I really don't know you well
You gotta get to know me, too
So see if we can make this work
Though your friends won't approve
See we can't let them know exactly what's going on
'Cause they won't understand (No no)
What we have between us
You might also like
What are we gonna do?
What are they gonna say?
Where are we gonna go
When they find out?
What are we gonna do?
What are they gonna say?
Where are we gonna go
When they find out?
(Woody, Woody, Woody, Woody, Woody)

I know we may be rushing
There's no time to think it through
'Cause when love overcomes your heart
There's nothing you can do
Misery loves company
By now you should know
People always have advice about being together when they're all alone
(I cry) I cry, I cry late at night baby
(Inside) Inside my heart babe I was all alone
Don't you let no goddamn body come in
And tear our love apart
'Cause I love you, girl
You're all my world
So what are we gonna do?
Mmm...
I feel so afraid, babe
I feel like a baby
Just hold me, darling
And let me know
I need to know
I've gotta know
What will we do...Baby

What are we gonna do?
What are they gonna say?
Where are we gonna go
When they find out?

What will we say
Where will we go
When they find out
When they find out, baby
But I don't really care
'Cause I won't go no where
'Cause you can always count on me
It makes me want to say
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
It makes me want to say
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh, baby baby
Oh, why why why why why why
