(Oh, said you gotta believe it)
Do you believe like I believe?
(Gotta believe it)
Do you believe in love?
(Alright)
Can't you see, like I can see
That we should be in love
(Help me sing it, Woody, help me sing it)

Sisqo and Lisa fell in love the other day
Talked one the phone so long
They caught the break of day
Keisha and Nokio don't talk like they used to
But I guess that's just the things we go through
When two are in love

Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see, like I can see
That we should be in love
Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see
Like I can see that we should be in love
(Help me sing it, help me sing it)
You might also like
You say you're tired of all those lonely nights at home
(Do you believe?)
Tossing and turning wishing you were not alone
I've got to find a way to get you in my life
(Do you believe?)
And if I do I'll promise you i'll make you my wife

Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see
Like I can see that we should be in love
Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see
Like I can see that we should be in love
(Sing it again)
Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see
Like I can see that we should be in love
(I believe)
Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see
Like I can see that we should be in love
(I ain't go no time)
I ain't got no time for love, not time for hugs
No time for me, what was I thinking of
Said I got to find a way to get you back to me
There are no guarantees in love
(Do you believe in love?)

Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see
Like I can see that we should be in love
Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see
Like I can see that we should be in love

Do you believe?
(Oh, oh)
Can't you see?
(Do you believe it?)
Do you believe?
(Like I believe in love, yeah, oh oh oh)
Can't you see
(You've got to believe it, oh)
Like I can see that we should be in love
Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love? (Said alright)
Can't you see
Like I can see that we should be in love
(Like I believe it)
Do you believe like I believe?
Do you believe in love?
Can't you see
