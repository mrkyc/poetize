Girl, I ain't got nothing to prove
I ain't got nothing to lose
I'm just a man that's so in love with you
Girl, I ain't nothing to prove
I ain't got nothing to lose
I'm just a man that's so-oh-oh-oh-oh

You say I'm much too young
To take you for a ride
Scared about what your friends might say
(They say it don't look right)
I say they must be crazy
Can't you make up your mind, and if I'm too young lady
Then I won't waste your time

Girl, I ain't got nothing to prove
I ain't got nothing to lose
I'm just a man that's so in love with you
Girl, I ain't nothing to prove
I ain't got nothing to lose
I'm just a man that's so-oh-oh-oh-oh

I wanna treat you special lady
Do the things other guys won't do
(Shopping sprees in Paris only if you want me to)
Ain't got no mansion, baby
No big house on the hill
But if you let me, baby
(I'll show you that I got skills)

I said I'm not too young to know
I'm not to young to know
And I'm not too old to grow
Never, never, never too old
And I'm not too shy to show
I ain't shy no more, baby
That I got these feelings for you
They won't ever, ever go
Girl, just let me treat you right
I'll take you out and I...

Hey, hey, ho

Can't you see that I'm knocking, baby
Huh, said I'm knocking, baby
