Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Sorry didn't notice you there
Then again you didn't notice me
So we'll remain passers by
Until the next time we speak
I hope that I can make you mine
'Fore another man steals your heart
And once your beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name
I'm hoping I can make you mine (Yes I)
'Fore another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart (Oh, sing)

It didn't take much time to think about
But I didn't want to move too fast
'Cause I knew that when I saw you again
That I wouldn't wanna let you pass
'Cause my eyes have seen the glory
In the coming of your smile
So I swear if you ever come 'round again
Please stay for a while
You might also like
Walks by me every day
(Ooh, baby, baby)
Her and love are the same
(Her and love are the same)
The woman that's stolen my heart
(Whoa, oh oh oh)
And beauty is her name (I'm hoping)
I'm hoping I can make you mine (I'm hoping)
'Fore another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine (In my eyes)
I swear we will never be apart (In my eyes, you are)

You are so beautiful
When I'm down and out (When I'm down)
I never seem to get tired...
(Tired of your love, ooh, tired of your love)
...of your love
('Cause you are wonderful)
You're wonderful
I'm just dying to make you see
Anything you want inside your heart
(You can find right here inside of me)

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
(I don't think you hear me)
And beauty is her name
I'm hoping I can make you mine
'Fore another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart
Walks by me every day
(She walks by me every day)
Her and love are the same
(Her and love are the same)
The woman that's stolen my heart
(Oh yeah)
And beauty is her name
I'm hoping I can make you mine
'Fore another man steals your heart
(Another man steals your heart)
And once this beauty is mine
(Ooh ooh yeah)
I swear we will never be apart
(Never, will never be apart, never be apart now, baby)
Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
(Feels so good to me)
And beauty is her name
(Feels so good to me)
I'm hoping I can make you mine
