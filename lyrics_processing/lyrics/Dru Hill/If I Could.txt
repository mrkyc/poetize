Yo Jazz

I can't believe
You were the girl no one ever wanted to be With
Kiss, hold, or do a thang
Real thing so shy really not my type no
There was no future for us, girl, honestly
It's been a while I ask myself how could this be
This girl is hot, she's looking so damn good to me
Tried to approach her but her feelings, they have changed
She's not checkin' for me

Hey there, love
You're looking better than you did before
Ooh, I never meant to hurt you, no
Sometimes I sit and wish I didn't ignore ya
Ooh, I'd change it if I could

What do I do for you to even notice me
See, me trying hard to win your heart
Did I hurt you all that bad?
It's been two years and you're still mad
Shorty, tell me
Never did I feel this way before
So many dimes I've been through
Never thought that Cupid had a bow for me
'Til the day you passed my mama's door
I didn't really mean to hurt you baby
So won't you please come back?

Hey there, love
You're looking better than you did before
Ooh, I never meant to hurt you, no
Sometimes I sit and wish I didn't ignore ya
Ooh, I'd change it if I could

You got me in a state of disbelief
I didn't know you were working with something
Saw your boy been frontin', oh
You looking good, girl
Looking better than you did before
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh
Ooh, you looking good, girl
Sometimes I sit and wish I didn't ignore ya

Ooh, I never meant to hurt you, no
Sometimes I sit and wish I didn't ignore ya
