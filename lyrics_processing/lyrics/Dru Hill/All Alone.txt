I'm gonna stay to myself
Where there's no one else around me
I'm gonna stay to myself
So that no one else can find me
That's what I'm gonna do
My baby love if I can't have you
Maybe I'm better off on my own

If I pray to myself
Maybe God above will hear me
And if it is in his will
Then he'll send you right back to me
I'll hold my feelings inside so that you won't see me cry
I hope it's all in my mind 'cause I'm scared

I'm gonna chill to myself
Leave the stress of a world from inside me
I'm gonna walk all alone
And leave all my troubles behind
That's what a man has to do
In his life just to make it through
I'm gonna chill to myself

(All alone)
Since you left me baby I've been steady cryin'
(All alone)
Wonderin' if you ever really truly loved me
(All alone)
I'll never give my heart again
(Baby, I've got to be alone)
Baby, can't you see just what is happening to me?
(All alone)
Won't you come along and baby rescue me?
(All alone)
I can't stand being all alone
(And I'll never)
Be alone again

Another time, another place, another love
Maybe it will happen then
But I won't live my life on faith, no
So I'll keep my tears inside and drift away
Where I'm all alone

(All alone)
Since you left me baby I've been steady cryin'
(All alone)
Wonderin' if you ever really truly loved me
(All alone)
I'll never give my heart again
(Baby, I've got to be alone)
Baby, can't you see just what is happening to me?
(All alone)
Won't you come along and baby rescue me?
(All alone)
I can't stand being all alone
(I'll never) Be...
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
