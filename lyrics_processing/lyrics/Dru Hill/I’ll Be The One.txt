I'll be the one
I'll be the one

I heard a rumor there's a vacancy
Somebody said he put you down
Seems he found pleasure in some other girl
Baby, he's doggin' you around
So now your looking for a special guy
Someone that you can call your boo
A man that cares about your feelings, girl
A man to just be good to you

(I'll be the one) I'll be the one making you feel alright
I'll be the one doing the things you like
(I'll be the one) I'll be the one keeping you up at night
I'll be the lover in your life
(I'll be the one) I'll be the one your gonna wanna call
I'll be the one making you climb the wall
(I'll be the one) I'll be the one don't have you begging me
I'll be the one you need

You gave him seven years of your life
To think about it makes you cry
Why don't you come with me, I'll make it right
Let's bump this nigga outta your mind
Let's take a ride, baby, no special place
Somewhere where we can be alone, hey hey
Take off the clothesa nd let our feeling flow
Baby I wanna groove you all night long
You might also like
(I'll be the one) I'll be the one making you feel alright
I'll be the one doing the things you like

I'll be the one making you climb the wall
(I'll be the one) I'll be the one don't have you begging me
I'll be the one you need

Here's a thang you should know about me, yeah
Jazz is the man when it comes to ladies
I know what I want (He know what he want)
Baby, I'm keeping it real
Ain't no him now that you're here with me (You're with me)
That's the way that it's gotta be (Oh yeah)
If you're down
Than be down
Don't be playing with my heart

(I'll be the one) I'll be the one making you feel alright
I'll be the one doing the things you like
