(Ooh) I just can't believe it, girl (Baby)
I can't believe that it's over
(Oh no, no, no)
But I'm a man (Woo-hoo, yeah)
And I'll be alright (Whoa-ooh)
But still, the love we had (Oh, oh yeah)
Stays on my mind

Lately, babe, I've been thinking
How good it was when you were here
And it ain't the wine that I've been drinking
For once I feel my head is clear
(Ooh yeah)

But early this morning
When I opened up my eyes
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise
I guess you meant more to me than I realized

The love we had stays on my mind
(Stays on mind)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Oh, oh oh, whoa-ho, yeah, oh yeah, sing it, Jazz)
You might also like
And lately, girl, I've been remembering
The good times that we used to share
My thoughts of you don't have an ending (Oh no, no, no)
And memories of you are everywhere
(Hey yeah)

But what should I tell you, ha, is not your concern
You win some, you lose some
Well, I've lost and I've learned
Sisqo's so lonely with no place to turn
And at the end, I, I-I-I-I-I find, yes, I do

The love we had stays on my mind
(Ooh, oh oh, oh, oh yeah yeah)

Girl, if you were nearer (Oh baby, baby)
If you had a mirror (If you had a mirror)
Maybe you could count my tears
(You don't know, don't know how I cry, baby)
And if you were nearer
It would all be clearer
(I want you right here)
How I wish that you were here
(I want you right here next to me, ha, mmm, mmm)
How I wish that you were here
Oh baby, wow I wish, oh I wish
How I wish that you were here
I wanna let 'em know, know, know, Jazz
And baby girl, I was tired
So I laid down to dream for a little while
But lately I've been so, so uninspired
(Take your time, take your time, take your time)
Without the comfort of your smile
(Hey yeah)

But I'm not complaining (No, no)
'Cause that's how it goes
There's always some heartache in this world I suppose
Huh, listen to me
But you can't imagine that nobody knows
Nobody knows, baby

The love we had stays on my mind
(That the love stays on my mind)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Oh, yes it, oh, yes it, oh, yes it - can you hear me? Hey)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Sometimes I get a little lonely)
The love we had stays on my mind
(I can't eat at night, I can't eat at night, I can't sleep at night, I can't sleep at night, Lord have mercy)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Yeah, yeah yeah)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Oh baby, ooh, yes, help me, say yeah yeah)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Yeah yeah, say yeah yeah, yeah yeah, ooh, say yeah yeah)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, hey hey)
The love we had stays on my mind
(Baby, baby, alright, alright, said)
The love we had stays on my mind
(The love we had stays on my mind, whoa, yeah, oh yeah)
