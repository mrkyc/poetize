I can't remember why we fell apart
Or even how the arguments all start
I got this crazy thought running through my head
Mmmm you keep insisting on convincing me that nothings changed
And keep on telling me I'm trippin but its not a game
Cause somethings different when I'm in it it don't feel the same
I keep on picturing another nigga been hold n you

I feel somebodies been touch n you
In fact I know somebodies been kissin' you
Do you want to tell me who's been love-n-you , love-n-you
Hold-n-you, I don't know why I been trusting you
Only did what I'm supposed to do
I don't know how I been such a fool for love-n-you
It never really mattered too much to me
I guess I was too blind and I could not see
The message in the words that I heard you say
Hmmm, that you're unhappy and you think you need some time away
These things just happen but I know they don't happen that way
I try and understand because I love you
