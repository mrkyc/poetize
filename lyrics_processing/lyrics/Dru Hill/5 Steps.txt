I don't know how much longer
You're going to be here
So I say my prayers
Every night
One for my mother
One for my father
And one for the love of my life
So if you decide to leave today
Then leave tomorrow at the door
And take only
Half of yesterday
And forget all hope for the present
Cause it just went away

We were five steps
From eternity
We were four steps
Four steps past love
And three wishes
We were three wishes
From touching the heavens above
Said we were five steps
From eternity
We were four steps
Four steps past love
And three wishes
We were three wishes, ooh
From touching the heavens above
So you know
You might also like
Another day is gone
Another night now dawn
Waiting patiently hope that you'll return
But not before long
Why'd you say goodbye
I still feel your presence
In my bed at night
And what was reality once
A love true in form
Has now added pain
For a man scorn
Forced to wear the memories of pain
Around an empty heart

Now I sit in silence and begin to think
As laughter echoes through the air
I can't get you off my mind
But a whole new love
I could never bare
So now I lay me down to sleep
And I pray my Lord my soul to keep
And if I die, before I wake
Then I promise I'll be there for you always
We were five steps
From eternity
We were four steps
Four steps past love
And three wishes
We were three wishes
From touching the heavens above
Said we were five steps
From eternity
We were four steps
Four steps past love
And three wishes
We were three wishes, ooh
From touching the heavens above
