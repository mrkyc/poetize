Hmm
Oh baby
Oh
I love you
Sing the song for me, Jazz

Does anybody stay together anymore?
Seems like love nowadays doesn't endure
We haven't always gotten along
But I stayed 'cause I always saw this day
And I wanna say

Millions didn't make it
But our love
One of the ones that did (Ooh yeah yeah)
I knew that we could make it (Me and you, baby, baby, baby)
Please be my wife
Grow old with me (Woo)
Millions didn't make it (Ours was a love that)
But our love
One of the ones that did (Made it, baby)
I knew that we would make it (I want you to, baby)
Please be my wife
Be one with me
You might also like
From the first time I saw you
I knew that you were God's gift to me
And I found(I found) my greatest strength in you (strength in you)
'Cause no one in this world's more precious to me than you, baby

Millions didn't make it
But our love (Ha)
One of the ones that did (Ours, one of the ones that did, yeah)
I knew that we could make it (I knew that we could make it, Ohhh)
Please be my wife (Hey)
Grow old with me (I'm saying I do)

I do, I do (I do, I do)
I do, I do (I do, I do)
I do, I do (I do, I do)
I do, I do
Love you forever (I do)
(Millions never made it, but I know)

Millions didn't make it (Yeah)
But our love
One of the ones that did (One of the ones that did)
I knew that we could make it (Know what I'm talkin' 'bout, baby)
Please be my wife
Grow old with me (Oh)
Millions didn't make it (Oh no, no no)
But our love
One of the ones that did (Baby, we can make it)
I knew that we would make it (I want you to, baby)
Please be my wife
Be one with me
(Millions)
Millions (Millions, millions)
Millions (Look at me and you)
Millions (We made it through, baby)
Millions (Just me and you)
Millions (All the tears we cried)
Millions (Baby, I love you, whoa)
