This is dedicated to my real angel Ms. Joan I Milburn Green love you mommy
You taught me everything
In life I'd need
Sometimes I felt you were
My everything
And if it were all left up to me
You'd be right beside me
But you're gone
Although I know
You're in a better place
So selfishly
I wish you could've stayed
How I long to hear you call my name
Lord give me the strength to carry on
And on
If you talk to my angel'
The one who carried me and gave me life
Could you tell her that I love her
And I can't wait to see her on the other side
Wooh (4x's)
Do Do Do Do Do
Rest in peace mommy
I love you

Was it all in vain when I gave my
Life to you, did I make the right decicions
Lord tell what am I supposed to do?

Is full of sin, and if I ever fall from your
Grace will you accept me againBridge
I want to know if I'm washed in your blood
Will you set my whole life free, if so (if so)
Then I'll continue to love thee
How could you forgive me
How could you forgive me when my
Life was filled with sin (your arm were
Open wide) when your arms were open, I turned
My back and then you continue to bless me it's
No further from the truth,(there's
No doubt about it) I said there's no
Doubt about it, never find a friend like you(Scola)
Why do you do it(oh why?)
When it seems I've forgotten you it
Just shows you know my heart and there is
None like you(Jazz)

Sound) if anyone can fix my life I know you're
