Beauty's gone
Yo, my time wasn't enough (But I'm spendin' all wit you)
My heart wasn't enough (But I'm givin' it to you)
My money wasn't enough (But I gave you all of that)
My house wasn't enough (But you live in that)
And now you're gonna leave?
What? Fuck it

I wish I never told you you should leave
I wish me and you never had my seed, ha
No, I better stop it that's a lie
'Cause girl you were the apple of my eye
It took a little time for me to see
That, girl, I need you right here next to me, ha
I could let you walk away but I'm not goin' out that way, no

Not that way (No)
Not goin' out that way
Girl, I can't live without you (No, no, no, no)
Can't be without you (No, no, no, no)
I'm begging you to stay (I wish you would just believe me)
Stay (Why can't you just listen to me)
You might also like
I love you (Oh)
And even though I said that you could leave me
I want another chance just to adore you
I still believe in you and me, I'm in love
I love you (Love you)
Why won't you take the time, take the time to see (Leave me)
'Cause I don't wanna have to live my life in misery (Adore you)
I wasn't ready for you to set me free
Don't give our love away, hey

Words can't describe how I feel about you
Only heaven knows how much I do
Girl, I'd put my own life on the line
I'll cherish and protect you with my life
All that shit I said, girl, I didn't mean
I'd die without your love, baby, if you leave
I could let you walk away, but baby I'm not goin' out that way

Not that way (No)
Not goin' out that way (Oh no)
'Cause I can't live without you (Live without you)
Can't be without you (Be without you)
I'm begging you to stay (Please don't leave me)
(I'd give anything if I could have you again)
Ooooh
I love you
Even though I said that you could leave me (I was just bullshittin' baby)
I want another chance just to adore you (I was just fuckin' around)
'Cause I still believe in you and me
I love you (Love you)
Why won't you take the time, take the time to see (Leave me)
'Cause I don't wanna have to live my life in misery (Adore you)
(I don't wanna live my life without you in it)
I wasn't ready for you to set me free
(You might as well just kill me)

All (All my)
My (My life)
Life (I sacrificed for you)
Sac (Baby I'd)
Ri (Sacrifice for you)
Ficed (Baby I'll sacrifice for you)
Until the rising sun
Christens a new baby dawn
I won't live without you
Won't be without you
I'm begging you to stay
(Can't you just understand I don't want to be with you)
Please stay
I love you (Yeah)
And even though I said that you could leave me (Don't want you to leave babe)
I want another chance just to adore you (Uh tell 'em Jazz)
(I just want to take my time to give you the love that I know that you want)
I love you (Love you)
Why won't you take the time (Oh tell em Jazz now)
Take the time to see (Let's take the time)
'Cause I don't wanna have to live my life in misery (Adore you)
I wasn't ready for you to set me free

'Cause I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, baby
And I still believe in you and me, yeah
(I love you)
Oh, I love you (Forever) I love you
I love you, I love you (Forever my lady)
Waiting for you, for you, baby
I love you

We made each other
I just need some time to get myself together
I taught you how to love
And you taught me how to love
And from that we created love (I love you)
You stayed with me while I was doin' wrong
So why would you leave me when I start doin' right
Beauty's gone
I love you
