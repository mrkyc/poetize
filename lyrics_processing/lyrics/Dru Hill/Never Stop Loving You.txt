You know I'll never stop wanting you
You know I'll never stop needing you
You know I'll never stop loving you
Without you I can't do a thing

Girl, I wonder what went wrong
Where we fell apart
From a love that was so strong
I wonder where our hearts got lost
Somewhere twisted and now
I'm trying to pull myself from off the ground
Girl, I just want to know where, how, and who are you loving now

All I know
I need you now
Need to work it out somehow
'Cause I can see your part of me
With you is were I need to be
Need to be
I wantna know why

You know I'll never stop wanting you
You know I'll never stop needing you
You know I'll never stop loving you
('Cause without you I can't do a thing)
You know I'll never stop wanting you
You know I'll never stop needing you
You know I'll never stop loving you
Without you I can't do a thing
You might also like
I'm puzzled
Heart is slowly dying
'Cause I don't know
Why I keep on trying
When you're so cold
Why I keep on crying only heaven knows
It's something deep inside
I just can't let it go
And I'm about to lose my mind
Girl, I can't sleep no more
Can't eat no more
Girl, I'm falling down
This is all because we had a falling out
I never meant to go that route

Won't you pull me from the pain I feel inside
Enough to make the strongest man break down and cry
Would you come and wipe these tear drops from my eyes
Loosing you is like loosing my mind
'Cause I need you in my life
I want to know why

You know I'll never stop wanting you
You know I'll never stop needing you
You know I'll never stop loving you
('Cause without you I can't do a thing)
You know I'll never stop wanting you
You know I'll never stop needing you
You know I'll never stop loving you
Without you I can't do a thing
I've loved you all my life (All my life)
And I've learned sometimes we sacrifice
Do whatever it takes
To make love turn out right

You know I'll never stop wanting you
You know I'll never stop needing you
You know I'll never stop loving you
Without you I can't do a thing
You know I'll never stop wanting you
You know I'll never stop needing you
You know I'll never stop loving you
Without you I can't do a thing

Baby, I can't live another day
Without you in my life
Won't be the same
(I'll never be the same, I'll never be the same)
Oh, what would I do
Can't take the pain
What would I do
Won't be the same
What would I say
Girl, things have changed
Girl, I can't leave this way
Come back to me
Come back to me, baby
Come back to me
