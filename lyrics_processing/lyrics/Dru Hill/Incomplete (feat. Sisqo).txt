Everything in this world that a man could want
I gotta bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now
Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers want to lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' outta time
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money, don't amount to you
So I can make belief I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
Say that without you girl
Listen, your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday, you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall
But being without you just ain't livin' nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine
You might also likeEven though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money, don't amount to you
I can make belief I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete, oh yeah
That without you girl
I just can't help loving you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything to hear you say
That you'll stay
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money, don't amount to you
I can make belief I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money, don't amount to you
I can make belief I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
Without you girl, my life, my life is incomplete
Without you girl, my life is incomplete, oh yeah
