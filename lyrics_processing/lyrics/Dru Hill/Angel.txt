Girl, it's been so long, since I held you in my arms
So I picked up a pen and paper, and decided to write you a song
Things just ain't the same, since you took your love away
All I have is dark and lonely days 'cause the sun dont shine my way

Wish that I could find the words to say to show you love is real
But words just can't express the way I feel

You're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together
Why you wanna leave me now?
Only you can ease the pain I feel and wipe my tears away
Won't you fly back home and make me whole again

Baby, not a day goes by, that I dont want to cry
When I think of what we had, and how you walked out of my life
All I had was yours to take, 'til my heart you chose to break
I wish that I could make love to you just one more time for all times sake

If only I could find the words to say to show you love is real
But words just can't express the way I feel
You might also like
'Cause you're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together
Why you wanna leave me now?
Only you can ease the pain I feel and wipe my tears away
So won't you fly back home and make me whole again

(Come back home) Oh-oh
(Come back home) Oh
'Cause without you here beside me, girl, my house is not a home
Only you can ease the pain I feel and wipe my tears away
Won't you fly back home and make me whole again

'Cause you're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together
Why you wanna leave me now?
Only you can ease this pain I feel and wipe my tears away
Won't you fly back home and make me whole again, yeah
You're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together
Why you wanna leave me now?
Only you can ease this pain I feel and wipe my tears away
