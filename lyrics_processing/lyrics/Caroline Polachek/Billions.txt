Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles
Oh, billions
Sexting sonnets
Under the tables
Tangled in cables
Oh, billions
Salty (Ah), flavor (Ah)
Lies like a sailor
But he loves like a painter
Oh, billions

Hand it over (Ah), broker (Ah)
Give me the closure
He's a pearl, I'm the oyster
Oh, billions

Ah, ah
Say, say, say, say something to me
Ah, ah
Say, say, say, say something to me

Headless angel
Body upgraded
But it's dead on arrival
Oh, billions
Twisted, manic
Cornucopeiac
Yeah, my cup overfloweth
Oh, billions

I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close
(I never felt so close to you)
(I never felt so close to you)

Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles
Oh, billions

Hand it over (Ah), broker (Ah)
Give me the closure
He's the pearl, I'm the oyster
Oh, billions
Ah, ah
Say, say, say, say something to me
Ah, ah
Say, say, say, say something to me
