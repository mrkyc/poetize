Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there riding the sleigh (Ah, ah, ah; Ho-ho-ho)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

With all the mistletoe dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the tinsel (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mm)
