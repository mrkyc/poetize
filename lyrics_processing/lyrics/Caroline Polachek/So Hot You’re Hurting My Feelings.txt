Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there killing the game (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so hot it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So hot you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

With all the X-rated dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the hustle (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)
