And you think you've seen trouble
Well you're lookin' at the man, uh-huh
Oh, the world's own original hard luck story
And a hard time losin' man

Oh, sometimes skies are cloudy
And sometimes skies are blue
And sometimes they say that you eat the bear
But sometimes the bear eats you

And sometimes I feel like I should go
Far, far away and hide
'Cause I keep a-waitin' for my ship to come in
And all that ever comes is the tide

And you think you've seen trouble
Well you're lookin' at the man, uh-huh
Oh, the world's own original hard luck story
And a hard time losin' man

Oh I saved up all my money
I'm gonna buy me a flashy car
So I go downtown to see the man
And he's smokin' on a big cigar
You might also like
Well he must've thought I were Rockefeller
Or an uptown man of wealth
He said, "Boy I got the car that's-a made for you
And it's cleaner than the Board of Health"

Then I got on the highway
Oh, I'm feelin' fine, I hit a bump
Then I found I bought a car held together by a wire
And a couple a' hunks o' twine

And you think you've seen trouble
Well you're lookin' at the man, uh-huh
Oh, the world's own original hard luck story
And a hard time losin' man

Oh, Friday night, feelin' right
I get out on the street
Standin' in the doorway
Was a dealer known as Pete

But he sold me a dime of some-a super fine
Dynamite from Mexico (super fine, fine, fine)
I spent all that night just tryna get right
On an ounce of oregano (woo)
And you think you've seen trouble
Well you're lookin' at the man, uh-huh
Oh, the world's own original
Hard luck story
And a hard time losin' man

If you think you've seen trouble (trouble)
Well you're lookin' at the man, uh-huh
Oh, the world's own original
Hard luck story
And a hard time losin' man

And you think you've seen trouble (trouble)
Well you're lookin' at the man, uh-huh
Oh, the world's own original
Hard luck story
And a hard time losin' man

And you think you've seen trouble (trouble)
Well you're lookin' at the man, uh-huh
Oh, the world's own original
Hard luck story
