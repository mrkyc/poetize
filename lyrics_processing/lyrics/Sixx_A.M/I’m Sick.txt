I, I bit down on my tongue
To see if I could feel
To see if I've been missin' anything
And I, I crystallized my lungs
To show you they were real
And waited for a sign that never came

(If I'm not breathin')
If I'm not breathin' (Breathin'), resuscitate my soul

Bring on the shame, bring on the pain
Yeah, I know that I'm sick, but gimme some more
I say yeah, we are the ill and the deranged
Yeah, I know that I'm sick, but gimme some more

(I'm sick, gimme some more)
(I said, I'm sick)

I, I'm wishing you the worst
'Cause I'm the bitter kind
And all this hate's been covered by a veil
But I, I might forget your name
And I'll forget my lies
And maybe I'll just lay here on the rails
You might also like
(If I'm not breathin')
If I'm not breathin' (Breathin'), resuscitate my soul

Bring on the shame, bring on the pain
Yeah, I know that I'm sick, but gimme some more
I say yeah, we are the ill and the deranged
Yeah, I know that I'm sick, but gimme some more

(I'm sick, gimme some more)
(I said, I'm sick)
Gimme some more
(I'm sick, gimme some more)
(I said, I'm sick)

Laugh at my face as I hang from this rope (Bring on the shame)
I'm such a disgrace with my misguided hope (Bring on the pain)
I look at my life in the blackest of ways (Yeah, I know that I'm sick)
But when in the hell will this fear go away? (Gimme some more)
Laugh at my face as I hang from this rope (Bring on the shame)
I'm such a disgrace with my misguided hope (Bring on the pain)
I look at my life in the blackest of ways (Yeah, I know that I'm sick)
When in the hell will this fear go away? (Gimme some more)

Hey!
Bring on the shame, bring on the pain
Yeah, I know that I'm sick, give me some more
I say yeah, we are the ill and the deranged
Yeah, I know that I'm sick, give me some more

(I'm sick, gimme some more)
(I said, I'm sick)
Gimme some more
(I'm sick, gimme some more)
