Well, all alone in your house of panic
(It's just an ordinary day)
And all the things that you love make you manic
(But you can't take them to the grave)

Well, you look like you could use a friend
Someone to make this madness end (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) To make this madness end
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Someone to make this madness end

And in a little while
All the noise in your head will fade away
And you will find some relief then
Yeah, you will find some relief then
And in a little while
All the weight of the world feels like a light rain
And you will find some relief then
Yeah, you will find some relief then

Your heart beats but you feel like you're dying
(It's just an ordinary day)
You're so numb but you can't stop crying
(Like a bipolar masquerade)
You might also like
Well, you look like you could use a friend
Someone to make this madness end (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) To make this madness end
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Someone to make this madness end

And in a little while
All the noise in your head will fade away
And you will find some relief then
Yeah, you will find some relief then
And in a little while
All the weight of the world feels like a light rain
And you will find some relief then
Yeah, you will find some relief then


And in a little while
All the noise in your head will fade away
And you will find some relief then
Yeah, you will find some relief then
And in a little while
All the weight of the world feels like a light rain
And you will find some relief then
Yeah, you will find some relief then
(In a little while, in a little while)
(In a little while, in a little while)
(In a little while, in a little while)
(In a little while, in a little while) Yeah, you will find some relief then
(In a little while, in a little while)
(In a little while, in a little while)
(In a little while, in a little while)
