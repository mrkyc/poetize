Sometimes it feels like you're my fucking enemy
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons in-)
Sometimes I fantasize that you will die instead of me
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons in-)
I could've loved you to death, but now I dance on your grave
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons in-)

I try, I try, but I can't erase it

I watched you fucking him
Right then your life was over
Thought you were Heaven-sent
Then everything went to hell
I watched you take him in
And I just stood there frozen
You killed what could have been
And everything went to hell

Sometimes it feels like you laugh at all my misery
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons in-)
Sometimes I'm paralyzed by my reckless jealousy
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons in-)
I coulda loved you to death, but now I dance on your grave
(You've got your demons in play, you've got your demons in-)

I watched you fucking him
Right then your life was over
Thought you were Heaven-sent
Then everything went to hell
I watched you take him in
And I just stood there frozen
You killed what could have been
And everything went to hell

Hey, I can't get to the phone right now
But if you leave a message, I'll call you back as soon as I can, thank you
Baby, I'm sorry
I didn't know what I was doing
And you were  him
And he  me
Please call me
Please don't walk away from me
I need you, I need you
I need you
 never leave me and you 

I watched you fucking him
Right then your life was over
Thought you were Heaven-sent
Then everything went to hell
I watched you take him in
And I just stood there frozen
You killed what could have been
