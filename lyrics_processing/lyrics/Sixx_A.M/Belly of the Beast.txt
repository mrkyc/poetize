I turned my back on Jesus in the belly of the beast
Sometimes your only choice is no choice at all
Sometimes the only voice you hear is when the devil calls
So listen
I'm holding on, I'm holding on
It don't matter how deep you're digging in the belly of the beast
It don't matter how far you're falling in the belly of the beast
Sometimes it's not worth dying in the belly of the beast
You better pray for your sins to kill you fast
You better pray how long this life will last
'Cause what you do, what do when you're living
Is what you do, what you do when you die
I dove off the cliffs of sadness in the belly of the beast
I inhaled the fumes of madness in the belly of the beast
Sometimes your only choice is no choice at all
Sometimes the only voice you hear is when the devil calls
So listen
I'm holding on, I'm holding on
It don't matter how deep you're digging in the belly of the beast
It don't matter how far you're falling in the belly of the beast
Sometimes it's not worth dying in the belly of the beast
You better pray for your sins to kill you fast
You better pray how long this life will last
'Cause what you do, what do when you're living
Is what you do, what you do when you die
