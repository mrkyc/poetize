(I am) Sick of being told how to feel by the old, the decrepit, and the greedy rich
(I am) Sick of being lied to, tied to a chain gang, rats on a sinking ship
Do you wanna bleed? (No!) Gonna take a knee? (No!)
Are you gonna stand up? I am, I am
Show me what you got before you start to rot
Are you fucking ready 'cause I am, I am

It's more than a warnin' shot

We're all barbarians, everybody say, "Amen"
Say a prayer for the blessed as they're dyin' in our hands
We're all barbarians, the end is comin' soon
Say a prayer for the chosen while they choke on silver spoons
And everybody say, "Amen" (Amen), "Amen" (Amen)
We're gonna steal the crown right off their heads
We're all barbarians

You can bury the infected, next to the rejected, somewhere in the valley of tears
You can wake up with a knife as you're coming back to life and they gut you as you're facing your fears
Well, do you wanna die? (No!) Are you gonna cry? (No!)
Are you gonna fight back? I am, I am
Are you gonna stop? Or take it to the top?
Are you fucking ready 'cause I am, I am

It's more than a warnin' shot

We're all barbarians, everybody say, "Amen"
Say a prayer for the blessed as they're dyin' in our hands
We're all barbarians, the end is comin' soon
Say a prayer for the chosen while they choke on silver spoons
And everybody say, "Amen" (Amen), "Amen" (Amen)
We're gonna steal the crown right off their heads
We're all barbarians
Barbarians, yeah, yeah, yeah


We're all barbarians, everybody say, "Amen"
Say a prayer for the blessed as they're dyin'. in our hands
We're all barbarians, the end is comin' soon
Say a prayer for the chosen while they die with silver spoons

We're all barbarians, everybody say, "Amen"
Say a prayer for the blessed as they're dyin' in our hands
We're all barbarians, the end is comin' soon
Say a prayer for the chosen while they choke on silver spoons
And everybody say, "Amen" (Amen), "Amen" (Amen)
We're gonna steal the crown right off their heads
We're all barbarians
We're all barbarians
