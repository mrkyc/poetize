You might bleed out with anger, you might blow your fragile mind
You wanna go faster, but you're runnin' out of time
You can sink like an anchor, you can bury all the bones
You're out on a tightrope, you're out there all alone

And everything you touch is so cold

You might feel like you're dyin', like you're diggin' your own grave
All bloodshot from cryin', but the tears won't wash away
Everything is so bleak, but the sun is beatin' down
You think it's a murder 'cause there's bloodstains on the ground

And everyone touch is so cold

It's never too late to fall on your sword
You can't run away because the wolf is at your door
But don't be alarmed, you're not alone anymore
I'll be right by your side when the wolf is at your door
(It's okay, it's alright, it's okay, it's alright)

You might live with the danger, but you're dancin' with the dead
You avoid medication so you're hangin' by a thread
In the valley of darkness, there is no promised land
I've seen my assassin, I've even held her hand
You might also like
And everyone I touch is so cold

It's never too late to fall on your sword
You can't run away because the wolf is at your door
But don't be alarmed, you're not alone anymore
I'll be right by your side when the wolf is at your door


It's never too late to fall on your sword
You can't run away because the wolf is at your door
But don't be alarmed, you're not alone anymore
I'll be right by your side when the wolf is at your door
It's never too late to fall on your sword
You can't run away because the wolf is at your door
But don't be alarmed, you're not alone anymore
I'll be right by your side when the wolf is at your door
