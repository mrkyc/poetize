Hey
How long have you been crawlin'
With the sick and the appalling?
It's like a cancer
Hey
You gotta rise up outta darkness
Gotta leave behind the heartless
You'll find the answer

If you're the last on Earth
Feel like you're damned or cursed
You have come to the right place
And if you have lost yourself
You can escape the hell
You have come to the right place

Sometimes you feel like givin' up
Sometimes you've bled out enough
Sometimes you've got to believe in somethin'
'Cause you're not the only one
Standing there losin' blood
You have come to the right place this time
You might also like
Hey
How long have you been rotting?
Your veins are slowly clotting
You're growin' weaker
Hey
You gotta wake up from the nightmare
There's nothing you will find there
Except the reaper

If you're the last on Earth
Feel like you're damned or cursed
You have come to the right place
And if you have lost yourself
You can escape the hell
You have come to the right place

Sometimes you feel like givin' up
Sometimes you've bled out enough
Sometimes you've got to believe in somethin'
'Cause you're not the only one
Standing there losin' blood
You have come to the right place

Sometimes you feel like givin' up
Sometimes you've bled out enough
Sometimes you've got to believe in somethin'
'Cause you're not the only one
Standing there losin' blood
You have come to the right place

If you're the last on Earth
Feel like you're damned or cursed
You have come to the right place
And if you have lost yourself
You can escape the hell
You have come to the right place

Sometimes you feel like givin' up
Sometimes you've bled out enough
Sometimes you've gotta believe in somethin'
'Cause you're not the only one
Standing there losin' blood
