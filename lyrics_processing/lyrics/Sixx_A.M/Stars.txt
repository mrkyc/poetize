Do you wanna go to Heaven tonight?
Leave the evidence far behind
Say alright (alright), alright (alright)
Do you wanna be my lover tonight?
We can leave everybody else behind
Say alright (alright), alright (alright)

Do you wanna see Heaven tonight?
Underneath those lights, you will look so beautiful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall?
See the stars before they fall?
Do you wanna be my love tonight?
And for all my life, it could be so wonderful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall?
See the stars before they fall?

Maybe we should just run away
Never look back as the world decays
Say alright (alright), alright (alright)
Nothing matters ever since the day
You pulled the pin in my heart like a hand grenade
Say alright (alright), alright (alright)

Do you wanna see the stars before they fall?
See the stars before they fall?
Do you wanna be my lover tonight?
And for all my life, it could be so wonderful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall?
See the stars before they fall?

Fall out of the atmosphere
Let's run
Run until we disappear and
Never let them come and catch us
Never let them take away our stars


Do you wanna see Heaven tonight?
Underneath those lights, you will look so beautiful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall?
See the stars before they fall?
Do you wanna be my lover tonight?
And for all my life, it could be so wonderful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall
See the stars before they fall?
Before they fall (oh-oh-oh)
Before they fall (oh-oh-oh)
Before they fall (oh-oh-oh)
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall? (oh-oh-oh)
Before they fall (oh-oh-oh)
Before they fall (oh-oh-oh)
Before they fall (oh-oh-oh)
