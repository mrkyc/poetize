She lights a candle, but she doesn't know why
She wants to save me, but I'm barely alive
My soul is thirsty, I just wanna get high
Make her go away

Now I'm hitting the wall and she begs me to quit
And she drags me to church but I'm scared to commit
And I'm losing my mind 'cause she hides all my shit
She won't go away

And all I ask of her is
Pray for me
'Cause I don't want to
Pray for me
If you love me
Cross your heart and hope that I won't die before the best day of my life
Just pray for me tonight

I dragged myself out of the bed that she made
And I escape her in a black motorcade
She's pushing bibles and a clear bill of health
I can't make her go away

And now I'm hitting the wall and she begs me to quit
And she drags me to church but i'm scared to commit
And I'm losing my mind 'cause she hides all my shit
She won't go away

And all I ask of her is
Pray for me
'Cause I don't want to
Pray for me
If you love me
Cross your heart and hope that I don't die before the best day of my life
Just pray for me tonight
