(Does your desire cause you harm?)
(Do you run away, or do you) face it?

Does your desire cause you harm?
Does it when the devil twists your arm?
Do you run away or do you face it?
Sometimes this love can demonize
Penetrates every heart and mind
Get it in your mouth and you can taste it
Whoa-oh-oh, where do we go-oh?
Whoa-oh-oh, where do we go?

The door is open, step inside
I'm frantic but alive
The oxygen is leakin' from my lungs
Come save me if you can
Unraveling and damned
I'm hopelessly romantic and high strung

And I love this more than you know
These cracks are starting to show
Instead of breathing, I just hyperventilate
And I'm freakin' out in my head
Just hangin' on by a thread
Instead of breathing, I just hyperventilate
You might also like
It's like a bullet in your back
Grabs your heart and turns it black
Is it really love or is it danger?
You get so close that I can't feel
You cut so deep that I can't heal
Am I like sleeping with a stranger?
Whoa oh, where do we go?
Whoa oh, where do we go?

The door is open, step inside
I'm frantic and alive
The oxygen is leakin' from my lungs
Come save me if you can
Unraveling and damned
I'm hopelessly romantic and high strung

And I love this more than you know
These cracks are starting to show
Instead of breathing, I just hyperventilate
And I'm freakin' out in my head
Just hangin' on by a thread
Instead of breathing, I just hyperventilate

Yeah!

And I love this more than you know
These cracks are starting to show
Instead of breathing, I just hyperventilate
And I'm freakin' out in my head
Just hangin' on by a thread
Instead of breathing I just hyperventilate
