Laughin' like we're crazy
Nothin' mattered, nothin' fazed me
We were younger then
So much younger then
And everything seems rotten
Through the eyes of the forgotten
And we were dumber then
So much dumber then

Well, have I judged a book by how it's bound?
Am I lost or am I found?
And are you with me?

Are you with me, now?
Come back from the dead
You've been inside your head for too long
Are you with me now?
Find the places that scare you
Come on I dare you
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

The years, they took their toll
And all the things I can't control
Come back to haunt me now
Almost taunt me now
Whats left to be afraid of?
We found out what we are made of
And we've come this far
We both have the scars

Are you with me now?
Come back from the dead
You've been inside your head for too long
Are you with me now?
Find the places that scare you
Come on I dare you
Are you with me?

Are you with me?
Are you with me?

Well, have I judged a book by how it's bound?

Come back from the dead (Back from the dead)
Been inside your head for too long (For too long)
Find the places that scare you (Places that scare you)
Are you with me now?
Come back from the dead
You've been inside your head for too long
Are you with me now?
Find the places that scare you
Come on I dare you
Oh, come on I dare you
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
