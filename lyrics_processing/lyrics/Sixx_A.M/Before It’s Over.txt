Well, the rain outside is pouring down like bombs on my parade
And you're not here to calm my nerves when I'm frantic and afraid
Oh, the madness in the air so thick, you can cut it with a knife
And the loneliness is all I've got to get me through the night

You left me years ago, just sitting in this hole
But it feels like yesterday, 'cause you won't let me go
It's like a thorn that keeps on diggin' in my side
And, to be honest, it's like both of us have died

And everything about myself just makes me wanna scream
Oh, why can't everything feel like I'm livin' in a dream?
And all I wanna do is have another chance to fall in love again
Before it's over

The taste of love and gasoline, it still permeates the room
And every sacred vow that we both made
Well, it fades like your perfume
Oh, I serenade you every night even though I know you're gone
And dance naked in the pale moonlight to our favorite song

You left me years ago, just sitting in this hole
But it feels like yesterday, 'cause you won't let me go
It's like a thorn that keeps on diggin' in my side
And, to be honest, it's like both of us have died
You might also like
And everything about myself just makes me wanna scream
Oh, why can't everything feel like I'm livin' in a dream?
And all I wanna do is have another chance to fall in love again
Before it's over


Woo, yeah, huh!
Hey!

You left me years ago, just lyin' in this hole
It feels like yesterday, why won't you let me go?
It's like a thorn that keeps on diggin' in my side
And, to be honest, it's like both of us have died

And everything about myself just makes me wanna scream
Why can't everything feel like I'm livin' in a dream?
And all I wanna do is have another chance to fall in love again
