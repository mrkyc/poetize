(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, yeah
(Ah-ah-ah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Ah-ah-ah)

I remember the first time
It was one of the worst times
You lied right to my face
Oh, the way that you stood there
You gave me a death stare
The kind you can't erase

When the angels break their wings (ah-ah-ah)
They crash and stumble (ah-ah-ah)
Just like we struggle

If we could have this one night over
Gotta get it right
We gotta get it right this time
You might also like
Cause we were young and indestructible (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Gotta get it right this time)
With any luck, we'll be unstoppable (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Gotta get it right this time)

And we can last forever
(Ah-ah-ah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
(Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, yeah

I remember the last time
More than all of the past times
And how you crawled away
You fought with a passion
Such overreaction
But you never fought to stay

When the angels break their wings (ah-ah-ah)
They crash and stumble (ah-ah-ah)
Just like we struggle
If we could have this one night over
Gotta get it right
We gotta get it right this time

Cause we were young and indestructible (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Gotta get it right this time)
With any luck, we'll be unstoppable (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Gotta get it right this time)

And we can last forever
(Ah-ah-ah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
(Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, yeah

And there's a chance for us tonight, oh-oh (There's a chance for us tonight)
And there's a chance to make it right, oh-oh, whoa-oh (There's a chance to make it right)

Cause we were young and indestructible (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Gotta get it right this time)
Oh, with any luck, we'll be unstoppable (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Gotta get it right this time)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) We were young (oh-oh-oh-oh)
We were young (ah-ah-ah-ah) (this time)
Gotta get it right
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) We were young (oh-oh-oh-oh)
We were young (ah-ah-ah-ah) (this time)
(We gotta get it right this time)
