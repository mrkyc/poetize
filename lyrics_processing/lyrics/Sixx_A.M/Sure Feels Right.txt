The traffic's backed up on the 405
And the smog's so thick you can cut it with a knife
But it gives me time
To think about my life
I take the 10 to the 5 to the 101
I got a song sitting here on the tip of my tongue
And the more I drive
The more I feel alive

Well, I don't know what you're doing to me
But it sure feels right
Well, I don't know what you're doing to me
But let's do it all night
When the sunlight breaks through the LA sky
For some damn reason, it makes me smile
And I don't know what you're doing to me
But it sure feels right

I'm driving down Sunset Boulevard
Sex Pistols on the radio in my car
And I must be high
I just saw Jesus walk by
I make a hard left as the sun comes up
Over Hollywood vampires pushin' their luck
Baby lock your door
Yeah, we've seen this before
You might also like
And I don't know what you're doing to me
But it sure feels right
And I don't know what you're doing to me
But let's do it all night
When the sunlight breaks through the LA sky
For some damn reason, it makes me smile
And I don't know what you're doing to me
But it sure feels right


And I don't know what you're doing to me
But it sure feels right
And I don't know what you're doing to me
But let's do it all night
When the sunlight breaks through the LA sky
For some damn reason, it makes me smile
And I don't know what you're doing to me
Woah, but it sure feels right, hey

Soaking up the sunshine, sittin' on the 405 (Sure feels right)
I can take my time just to do what I like
Because it sure feels right (Sure feels right)
Just singing to the radio
I don't know what you're doing to me
But let's do it all night (Sure feels right)
Ooh-ooh (Sure feels right)
Just singing to the radio (Sure feels right)
Everybody's singing to the radio
