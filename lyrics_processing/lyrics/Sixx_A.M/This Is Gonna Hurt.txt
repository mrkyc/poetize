Feels like your life is over
Feels like all hope is gone
You kiss it all away
Maybe, maybe
This is a second coming
This is a call to arms
Your finest hour won't be wasted, wasted

Hey, hey, hell is what you make, make
Rise against your fate, fate
Nothing's gonna keep you down
Even if it's killing you
Because you know the truth

Listen up, listen up
There's a devil in the church
Got a bullet in the chamber and
This is gonna hurt
Let it out, let it out
You can scream and you can shout
Keep your secrets in the shadows and you'll be sorry
Everybody's getting numb (Everybody's getting numb)
Everybody's on the run (Everybody's on the run)
Listen up, listen up
There's a devil in the church
Got a bullet in the chamber and
This is gonna hurt
You might also like
You got your hell together
You know it could be worse
A self-inflicted murder
Maybe, maybe
You say it's all a crisis
You say it's all a blur
There comes a time you've gotta face it, face it

Hey, hey, hell is what you make, make
Rise against your fate, fate
Nothing's gonna keep you down
Even if it's killing you
Because you know the truth

Listen up, listen up
There's a devil in the church
Got a bullet in the chamber and
This is gonna hurt
Let it out, let it out
You can scream and you can shout
Keep your secrets in the shadows and you'll be sorry
Everybody's getting numb (Everybody's getting numb)
Everybody's on the run (Everybody's on the run)
Listen up, listen up
There's a devil in the church
Got a bullet in the chamber and
This is gonna hurt
This is gonna hurt

Listen up, listen up
There's a devil in the church
Got a bullet in the chamber and
This is gonna hurt
Let it out, let it out
You can scream and you can shout
Keep your secrets in the shadows and you'll be sorry
Everybody's getting numb (Everybody's getting numb)
Everybody's on the run (Everybody's on the run)
Everybody's getting some (Everybody's getting some)
Everybody's on the run
This is gonna hurt (Hey hey hey hey hey hey)
