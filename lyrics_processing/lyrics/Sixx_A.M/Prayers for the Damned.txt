When I wake up to the sound of demons
They're always tellin' me that I'm no good
And all the angels keep scratchin' at my door
I'm doin' what I can to fight this anger
I'm just a product of a living hell (living hell)
And I don't wanna live like this no more

Everything is crumblin' in my head (In my head)
Sometimes I wish I was

But maybe I'm not alone
Maybe if you take my hand
And I reach up to God
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for the damned
What have I got to lose
When I've already lost it all?
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for
Say a prayer for the damned
For the damned

Have you ever been abused by someone
So brutal that it chills your soul?
Have you ever been afraid of your own ghost? (Afraid of your own ghost?)
You might also likeI'm just a creature of a broken past
We're all lookin' for a second chance
And I don't wanna live like this no more

And all the madness rages in my head (In my head)
Sometimes I wish I was

But maybe I'm not alone
Maybe if you take my hand
And I reach up to God
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for the damned
What have I got to lose
When I've already lost it all?
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for
Say a prayer for the damned

We are not alone
It's darkest before the hope
But you and I, we're not alone

Maybe I'm not alone
Maybe if you take my hand
And I reach up to God
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for the damned
What have we got to lose
When we've already lost it all?
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for
Say a prayer for the damned

(Say a prayer for the damned)
(Say a prayer for the damned)
(Say a prayer for the damned)
