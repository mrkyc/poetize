You ain't never buried your brother
You ain't never been broke and had to put food in your stomach
You ain't run from an undercover
You ain't have a clue how it feel living life in the gutter
You ain't never sell no blow
You ain't never take no blows, nigga take no loss
You ain't never sleep on no floor
You ain't never had to get low cause you're thrown in the cross
You ain't never ducked no shots
You ain't never had no cops come knocking at your door
I barely ever see my pops, it was just me and mom dukes just in case you ain't know
You ain't never seen no murder
You ain't never seen no nigga with a tag on his toe
You ain't never lose your legs
You ain't never shoot no craps, bet all on the four
You ain't never cooked no coke
You ain't never beefed with the other side, man I paid toes
Your homie ain't did no jokes
Yeah, I looked out for his kids just in case you ain't know
You ain't never hit no lick
You ain't never came home and ain't no food in the fridge
I ain't never had no picks to this, but it is, but my hood ain't raise no bitch
You ain't never lose your faith
You ain't never stand in a corner had to fight no case
You ain't never sleep in no cell, cause you ain't had no bread ducked off in a safe
You ain't never made no cake
You ain't never made no chips, nigga Frito-Lay
You ain't never load no K
You don't know what it's like living where them niggas don't play
You might also likeIt's where niggas just don't know
Shit sounds kinda scary, right? Right...
It's trial and error nigga, Roll em'

You ain't never ducked no bullets
You ain't doubled backed with the oowop lookin'
You ain't never had the laws get behind you with a trunk full of gas, nah nigga you've never had to book it
You ain't even know what they was cookin'
Walk past the kitchen, I was like 6 years old
Pops at the table with the powder
Uncle got the water boiling over the stove, uh
You ain't even know what it was like to grow with no lights for like most of your life
Run extension cord across the street and borrow power from your neighbors at night
You ain't never fight that fight, stand up to beat cancer twice
You ain't never need radiation, take medication, cry yourself to sleep at night
You ain't been read your rights with a gun in your face
You ain't never catch no case
We ain't never catch no break
You ain't never catch no fade
You ain't never ever ever been jumped, put your back on the wall, stay around or run, nigga knuckle up
Live fast, nigga buckle up, die young we done lost too much
Man them niggas where I'm from never gave a fuck
You ain't never hang with us
You ain't never let a few shots go off in the air just to make sure that bitch'll bust
You ain't never come back there, they don't pack fair
You ain't put balloons in the air
Rest in peace Jackie, the pain still there
