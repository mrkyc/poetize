She told me she could love me right, if I let her
I told her I could fuck her good, if she let me
I'm built Ford tough but I roll Chevy
Buck 50 soaking wet but roll heavy
Getting head while i'm driving, now that's deadly
Nightmares of getting shot down, scary
Got million dollar dreams and it's comin'
To my niggas in the gutter keep hustlin'
But most niggas ain't talking 'bout nothin'
I bought a Rolly since they say my time comin'
I know some real niggas getting to this money
I had to get up get out and get somethin'
Cool nigga but don't push my button
Rude boy I smoke a whole onion
They say them boys in the hood straight trouble
But they brothers, if you fuck with one then all them niggas ridin
And if it all go down tonight then I'm ridin...
Even when my niggas wrong or right shit I'm ridin...
I keep a down ass bitch on side me who ridin...
Tell'em niggas we, yeah, old pussy ass niggas we ridin...
I'm tryin to get to Heaven while livin on Hell
Use a bitch for a meal till I get my deal
I got a couple sales where I put my scale
My hommie got Bonnie trying to post bail
Ask questions never nigga squeeze whenever
Like the hommie Krizzle fool it's now or never
I sold dope I know I'd be a dope nigga
Tell my killer I say fuck him if he catch me slippin
When I'm on making money, making history
Burn a pound out in public like a hippie
Cold world got your boy with no feelings
From a town where any nigga could get it
Stay strapped fool, I choose to roll with it
I keep banana clip for gorillas
They say them boys from the hood be illin
Straight ign'n if you fuck with one then all them niggas ridin

Even when my niggas wrong or right shit i'm ridin...
