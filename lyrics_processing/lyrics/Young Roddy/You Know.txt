Life

Uh
I bet a real bitch gon' pick up when a real nigga call, girl
I'm tired as hell with no days off
That pussy good I might dose off
I bet a real bitch gon' stay there if her man get locked behind bars
Homie call home like "what my son doin'?
And keep my kitty cat warm for me"
I bet a real nigga gone stand tall whenever times gettin' mad hard
Boy, we was raised up on that G-Code
It's trap life like its legal
I bet a real nigga gon' take care of them kids, fuck them broads
Boy, it's heartless out here, had to hustle
I don't want none of that for my youngin'
Like BIG said, I get money
Til' God callin' my number
Tryin to make it out of this jungle
Smoke that la-la-la for my troubles
Was flat broke, no stuntin
So that la-la-la to get money
Them shots ringin', they bustin'
Got my block hot as a oven
I'm young, rich and I'm famous
I can't forget about thuggin'
They say I'm all the way buggin'
Smoke that reefer all up in public
I'm lickin' shots at them haters
Stay the fuck away from my huddle
Either way them hoes gon' feel me
Tell them niggas hate it or love it, nigga
You might also like
You know, nigga, you know
I'm tryin' to see what her neck like
It's Jet Life to my next life
You know, nigga, you know
I been busy stacking that cake up
Tryna get my weight up
You know, nigga, you know
I'm highed up on that good shit
I'm all about that Good Sense
You know, nigga, you know
And they ain't talking 'bout nothin'
If they ain't talkin' 'bout money nigga

Hol' up, they know
When that loot get slim, they better lay low
Me and the clique pop up like Eggos
And lay ya balls down for that payroll
I'm all about that cheddar
Pepper jack, alfredo
You won't see manana
Comin' short of my pesos
Now bad bitches, I take those
AJ Beats, I slay those
Lungs full of that killer, killer
I'm on fire like ray co
I drops bombs all on the track
They can't handle my pay load
It's mingo baby, I'm in beast mode
I only go by the G-Code
I keep it trill with my people
I'm a lot this high, they equal
I'm on another level from these niggas, no, I can't see you
Stop worryin' about what we do
These lame niggas so see through
Got a lil older and made some change
Now all of sudden you a G too
I don't think so, you still a lame-o
You gets no love, that's how the game go
I remain O... G for sure, No L's but who keepin' score
Kushed out and I'm sittin' low
Stackin' grands, mackin' hoes
Talk is cheap to a nigga like me
If you ain't speakin' 'bout that dough... nigga
You know, nigga, you know
I'm tryin' to see what her neck like
It's Jet Life to my next life
You know, nigga, you know
I been busy stacking that cake up
Tryna get my weight up
You know, nigga, you know
I'm highed up on that good shit
I'm all about that Good Sense
You know, nigga, you know
And they ain't talking 'bout nothin'
