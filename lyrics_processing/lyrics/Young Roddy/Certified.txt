Had mary jane all on my brain while sittin' up in this interview
Weed smoke all in my lungs I'm bound to fail this physical
Beefin' with that nigga fuck I might fuck his girl intentional
Crap game that second period I'm tryna duck that principal
Was flat broke but I won 300 bucks fuck I guess this will do
I spent it all on a pitbull and some Michael Jordan tennis shoes
Thought I came up but I came short boy real talk that's critical
But real niggas don't fold I hold my head high, I'm a general
And I feel Wayne with no worries but I wonder will I see thirty
Cause them jack boys stay rollin' man them niggas outchea lurkin'
And I'm still riding like fuck em and that make my mom mad nervous
No leaks around my faucet man them groupie bitches so thirsty
Bitch I'm shinin' cause I'm working gettin' that paper cause I deserve it
Tryna smoke away my pain I hope this L'll never stop burnin'
It's just me myself plus mary tryna make it out of this journey
I try to share my vision but they vision way too blurry
And them same niggas they riding with'll be the same niggas that burn em
Them same niggas they plottin' with be the same niggas that murk em
My cousin got him a 9 to 5 but his money slow as a turtle
Now he hollerin' bout how he quitting straight back to the block to go get it
And I can't even much blame him he like "hurry up and get famous"
Cause yo shit colder than they shit he say they ain't even much hating
So till they get you your tour bus he be posted up and he slangin'
Put your living up in that murder cap be no gang banging they banging
It's Jet Life to my next life with the Andretti and Mingo
Smoke that Sour D for my nerves, fool, and that O-G for my anger
Cloud nine what I'm sitting on full sky cap my angle
But when I'm done ho please don't fall in love
