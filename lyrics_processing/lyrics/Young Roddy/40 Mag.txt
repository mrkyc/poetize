From start to finish, from the rags to the riches, the beginning and the ending nigga, the only thing a nigga could say is that nigga was on his grind, you hear me?

Let me hit that bitch one time before I go in
Good looking my nigga

And its crazy how they wanna build me up just to tear me down
They said I'm crazy cuz I used to cop them pounds just to burn that down
No I can't get caught, man I can't get caught, who gonna bail me out?
Man you're all I got, yeah you're all I got, fate don't fail me now
Cruising up in this skinny lane with these fat ass tires
I was speeding after that money and damn near wrecked my ride
I was on my grind, I was on my grind, I'm just trying to get mine
I was on that gas, I was on that gas sitting on cloud nine
Riding on them hoe ass niggas trying to hold me up, old slow-ass niggas
They lying all up in they lyrics, them niggas ain't never lived around no killers
Its free my homeboy Dip we from the same hood  my nigga
I used to walk around hella broke 'til I finally met a plug and I started drug dealing

I gotta get it while I could ain't no time for no fronting
I used to have a pocket full of lint, real shit, 'til a nigga made some money
I was on my grind, I was on my grind, I'm just trying to get mine
I was on my grind, I was on my grind, I'm just trying to get mine
I gotta get it while I could ain't no time for no fronting
I used to have a pocket full of lint, real shit, 'til a nigga made some money
I was on my grind, I was on my grind, I'm just trying to get mine
I was on that gas, I was on that gas sitting on cloud nine

Bitch on a nigga back, man can't a nigga breath?
And I'm just trying to keep it cool like the winter breeze
Told her one day I'll be on, she was like "Nigga please"
Soon as  day came she was there asking for her keys, bitch
But I'm just trying to make it out this trap dog
Without getting caged up or getting clapped dog
Real talk I've been  ghetto past dog
Real shit I'm tired of hearing "My bad dog"
First they love me, then they hate me, they don't even know
I turned nothing into something believe it or not
When I was puffing on that loud they told me "Turn it down"
I kept a Glock in my drawers, rocks in my socks
I'm headed nowhere fast, I'm headed nowhere fast
They said I'm bound to crash homie
I almost got shot down, I almost got shot down
Good thing my mama be praying for me
Nigga made a little change now I finally got some jack money
They say the homie be stunting like a nigga never had money

And its crazy how they wanna build me up just to tear me down
They said I'm crazy cuz I used to cop them pounds just to burn that down
No I can't get caught, man I can't get caught, who gonna bail me out?
