I figured all this shit out, man. All it. This whole world moves forward through transactions. Commerce, nigga. The exchange of goods and services. All the real ballin' successful folks are sellers. And all the broke-ass people playin' catch up are buyers. I ain't tryin' to go out like that P. Imma be a seller. Imma get my own business, change the game

It don't cost much to pay attention
Fool this that legal dealin'
It don't cost much to pay attention
Alright alright alright alright
Still on my pimp shit, I got a whole gang of them hoes
My homeboy trapped out until the Feds kicked in his door
Just like my corner store bitch get your shit in gold
Free Meek Mill, man they don't love me no more
She said she tryna make some money, bitch I know that's right
She say she stripped to make some hundreds, bitch I know that's right
She screamin', "Money over niggas!"
I'm like sho' you right
But in my world it's M.O.B. bitch, and I know that's right
Mad broke with them bills due, I know what that's like
Feel like God don't hear you, I know what that's like
Uncle killed by them gunshots, I know what that's like
But still, it's fuck them niggas bitch, fuckin' right

She told me love her for one night
I'm like alright alright
She told me fuck her right
I'm like alright alright
I guess they ballin' just like Route
Alright alright alright
They told me they gonna take my life
Alright alright alright
She told me love her for one night
I'm like alright alright
She told me fuck her right
I'm like alright alright
I guess they ballin' just like Route
Alright alright alright
They told me they gonna take my life
Alright alright alright

Been up all day tryna count that money
If it ain't bout loot, then it ain't bout nothin
Been flightin' all night tryna make that doe
You can ask my ex, I don't save no ho
Post up, hit the block 'til the money start comin'
Every time we fuck I turn that kitty to a puddle (splash)
Man a nigga ain't never gonna take nothin' from me
Broke nigga's always cryin' about somethin'
