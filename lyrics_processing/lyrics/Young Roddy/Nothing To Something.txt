A pro in the kitchen they call me a chemist
Had a few grand but it felt like a million
The tables still turning that shit got me dizzy
I know how it goes: stack it, flip it, then spend it
Stacking that doe stretch it out like pilates
Deep in that pussy she calling me papi
So close to the edge hope nobody don't try me
Stunt on them niggas like KD and Russell
Was raised by killers and I'm making a killing
Been losing so much it feel good to be winning
Been sinning so much I hope God forgive me
Been going so hard from start to finish
Been killing the game the Lord is my witness
Been stacking that money up, even my pennies
Fuck a bitch nigga and fuck them critics
Word to my hood I'm the king of my city
 x2
I started with nothing and turned it to something
Hate all you want but you can't knock my hustle
Them bitches they coming a dime a dozen
Ball on them niggas like  Russell

I traded my scale for a hard drive
I was taught to never ball block
If we all grind then we all shine
Chasing that doe til my heart stop
I'm on a full time grind, no part time
And I don't want half I want all mine
I turned my block into a cash cow
Trapped all night then I cashed out
Been losing my mind, they told me I'm illin
Been chasing that money I had to go get it
They calling my phone I tell them I'm busy
No love for them bitches who slept on a nigga
Counting that money like nigga we made it
Repping good sense but a nigga still crazy
Fuck a bitch nigga and fuck them critics
Word to my hood I'm the king of my city
You might also like
I'm on a full time grind, no part time
And I don't want half I want all mine
I turned my block into a cash cow
