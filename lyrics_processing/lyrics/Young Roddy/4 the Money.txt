I shipped it off and got paid
I blaze for them days I had to work like a slave
My nigga said he blaze for them days he was on paper
Probation, been a long time waiting almost drove my nigga crazy
And yeah I understand but that ain't long cause we been praying
Ain't complaining, I'm just saying
This rap shit gon' make us major
I mapped out my plans, passed it out to my man
Bible on my right hand
I swear to God we get this paper
Now my eyes low like I'm Asian
Stay blowed like a Haitian
Sent my momma to Jamaica when I make it
I promise my girl a gold bracelet, goddaughter a Mercedes
Soon as I get my pesos, no plan
I bet a nigga ball like a Laker
Sign my homies to the label
Good Sense but we ain't never gave a damn
My kicks fucked up cause I be getting out the mud
I cop an ounce from cuz and smoke it on blood


What up, Mike that's my stepdad
Homie taught me how to fix a flat, taught me how to bat
I know that shit ain't much, but that's way more than my dad
And nah, I ain't dissing neither, nigga, that's my mans
But it is what it is though, my nigga, I'm just saying
My father done a bid, stepfather done a bid
My momma had a gig, so what that make me
Nigga, the man of the crib, small thing to a G
I can handle this shit, uh, and that I did
And best believe I held that shit down with ease
Them good trees hold my hard times at ease
But good grief man, they think life a peach, damn
And all this dirty money, give me the need for speed
I'm tryna find a spot to plant my money tree
Uh, word to Pimp C, I'm sippin' out this jug
I cop an ounce from cuz and smoke it out with blood, boy
