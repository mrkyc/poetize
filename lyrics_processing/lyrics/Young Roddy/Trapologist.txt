I'm thinking what heaven like, since we trapped in hell
My cousin  his kids like he trapped in jail
That's a tough pill to swallow imagine how he feel
He told me spit that real I told him hold his head playa
My negative words, they keep a bad smell
Them dead pres I stacked turned stale
That's money I done saved up for years
Just in case that karma come too quick
I be still on my shit, real shit
I got it in while them niggas was yawnin'
Had a pocket full of stones 'til six in the mornin'
It's like a full-time job not to kill your opponent
I can direct you to who got it if you really want it
Tossing turning cold sweat, that's if you're sleeping on me
School of hard knocks man I earned my diploma
And I graduated with honours man it ain't no lie
And them bitches think I'm dead wrong since I made it live
And they told me to get a job, a suit and a tie
But I'm like fuck them  they ain't no friend of mine
So it's jet life 'til my next time
And its BFA 'til my deadline
Young Rod and Phips smoke a mary time
Smoke that loud as I drive bumping "Ready To Die"
It took a while to get this zone, girl don't blow my high
Can't forget them long nights, that studio life
You might also like
This shit remind me of the trap life
Same hours different grind, trap life
Flashback and rewind, trap life
Most niggas don't make it out of this trap life
Exactly what it sound like, trap life
Steady chasing a dollar, trap life
Be damned if I get trapped in this trap life
Most niggas don't make it out of this trap life

Most niggas are forever our toast
Cause they couldn't be here to see me, the bubbly overflow
Cause success is a drug, and I happened to overdose
 my lady have her chauffeur to open doors
By some old white cat in a top hat
Son of Miss Daisy whom my uncle drove a while back
Man ain't that funny how the tables turned?
These independents making millions while these labels burn
Got me owning my own masters, not too shabby for slaves
My old head said to get paid, young blood get paid
I ain't never been no one to stray away from the real
That's why I'll take the whole deck if I don't feel how you feel
Make you shit in your pampers have you niggas embarrassed
Try not to get too carried away like some niggas in Paris
But it's provocative that's why they  Phips he speak with confidence
It's obvious why me and Roddy click we trapologists
This shit remind me of the trap life
Same hours different grind, trap life
Flashback and rewind, trap life
Most niggas don't make it out of this trap life
Exactly what it sound like, trap life
Steady chasing a dollar, trap life
Be damned if I get trapped in this trap life
