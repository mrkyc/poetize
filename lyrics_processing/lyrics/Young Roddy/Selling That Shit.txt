Better rap my way to a mil'
 it's all in the wrist
I used to hustle that snow, I was tryin' get rich
Sell purp' for my nigga, my dog got hooked on that shit
And I don't know where you from
But where I'm from, it fully be hard as a bitch
I met a dope chick, and went half on a kid
It's just me and my nigga, tryin' go half on a brick
I came up with a plan, a master plan that'll get us out this bitch
And I don't know where you from
But where I'm from, them niggas selling all that shit
My eyes bloodshot red, but a nigga still smoking that shit
My homie girl start cheatin' on him
And real talk I know just what he feel
They say what go around come around
Uh, I guess it is what it is
Shit, and I don't know where you from
But where I'm from, them hoes be wiling in a bitch
And if you need it they got it
They on the block 'til the feds come knockin'
Ballin' be my hobby
I gotta win boy, losing not an option
I hustle hard to my grave
I'm getting paid like every damn day
Got money to be made, I'm making bread like a hunnid' different ways
Better get it right and keep it right
What, I shine bright like a street light
Uh, yeah we beefin' then it's on sight
I fuck her good all day, all damn night
I hustle hard all damn night
I grind hard all day, all damn night
Grind hard all day, all damn night
Grind hard all day, all damn night

And I don't know where you from
But where I'm from niggas selling all that shit

Born and raised in New Orleans
Where most motherfuckers have small dreams
But not me, I'm a true OG in the streets
I was ballin' like Spalding
All I know is get dough
I could turn nothing into something man
Rapping  trapping, lil' nigga used to call me hustle man
I break a beat down like a brick
Then serve it out to my beams
Yeah I'm a mayor and a franchise player of the jets
Homeboy that's the winning team
Magnolia is my home, willow street was my court
Soon as I jumped off the porch, the work start moving like a porsche
Nationwide with my hustle gang
I be getting money all over boy
Never had to worry 'bout the local boys
Cos they was too busy worryin' 'bout the local boys
I was just duckin' the feds, really living life on the edge
Weren't tryna' be in the cage, so I had to find another way to get paid
I had a few bitches movin' the yay
Some more bitches movin' the green
And I was outta' sight, outta' mind
I wasn't even on the scene
OG, beep beep for that money boy, gets no sleep
I don't even hustle like I used to, nigga look where this rap shit took me
