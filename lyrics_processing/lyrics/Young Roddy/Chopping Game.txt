Took a long time, but I got here
Thug life like Pac, yeah
No they don't play fair, them boys they shoot at cops here
Big dog my K9's, selling weed was my day job
Been through it all, learned to fight at that playground
Glock by my waistline I roll around like greyhound
Still sipping lean with my redbone from H town
Ain't no more play time, nope no more play time
I don't want no pussy without getting no Facetime
Shine like my Rolex, grind til no more left
Fresh off that tour bus right back to my projects
Fiends hit my hotline, cops kicked my door down
Real recognize real boy I don't need no cosign
In case shit might go wrong its back to my trap phone
Sleep when I'm dead I've been working my ass off
Racks in my Jansport, tattoo my passport
Speed for that cash like I'm driving a NASCAR
Life


I put it together we getting paid
I took it to Eddie to get it sprayed
And ride through the city like I could never die
I'm trying to get it ain't satisfied with just getting by
See a different picture this some HD shit
Pocket watching motherfuckers ain't gonna make me rich
I hit the pavement like a man, pockets all grown up
Now these bitches out here talking like he all blown up
A different state of mind, I think I'm stuck in my ways
A nigga gotta grind, I can't be wasting the days
Getting faded riding slow, but we chasing it fast
And when I'm flipping in the 'Lac the only time I'm on my ass
Say a prayer for me momma, they hate to see me shine
Even though I got it honest niggas plotting on what's mine
As them 84's twist through the street
I gotta calm my nerves, about to roll another sweet
Roll another sweet
