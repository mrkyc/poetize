Whole team ridin', this my whole 'hood ridin'
Whole team ridin', this my whole 'hood

I got twenty-five lighters on my dresser
I had a shoot-out once
I threw it twice, don't you test me
My flow sick; I'm sneezing on the track, God bless me
My neighbor lost her son to a bullet, God help her
My wrap sheet clean, but all my homies got felons
I be goin' so hard
Shit I feel it's now or never
I got a black queen like Keisha straight from Belly
Her last man's hatin' and my old ho's jealous
What's the recipe to kill these beats? I never tell it
Back then, I turn my momma crib to a telly
Fell in love with this one bad bitch, her name was Mary
Introduced her to my bro, told my mom I'm gettin' married
Everybody tellin' tales; liar liar, Jim Carrey
A skinny-ass nigga, in the streets I'm hella heavy
Every time I talk that street shit, they don't know about it
I don't own no Maybach, I don't own no Bugatti
All I own is a SS Ninety-Six Impala
Drive it like a Nascar, knowin' it's a long body
Word to Master P, I keep it G, I'm 'bout it 'bout it
All the fiends call my phone cause they know I always got it
Nigga stay fresh, stay fly like a pilot
You can find my in the cut ducked off like I'm hidin'
Dope man pulled up, boy that's perfect timing
Nigga fuck with Route, they fuck around and start a riot
Whole team ridin', bitch, my whole 'hood ridin'
Word to my nigga Jizzle, real niggas never die
On the corner sellin' stones all day and all night
Good thing I had some work put away for a drought
'Bout to go on tour, told my dime-piece to keep it tight
Most of these rap niggas whack, don't believe the hype
I been writin' all day, writin' raps and writin' kites
To my nigga in the pen, they tryin' to give my nigga life
We was chillin in the 'hood, on our Huffy's poppin' wheelies
All we heard was gunshots, another body by the building
I seen the car speed off, I think it was a Civic
Know the color, know the shooter, still I never do no snitchin'
Got a rat up in your crew, boy that's bad for your business
'Bout to blow, I'm so close, fool, I'm talkin' fourth and inches
Got a trill bitch who'll die for a nigga
She keep her legs spread and let me dive in that kitty
Lucky me..
