Good Sense

Uh and I know this shit ain't sweet but it's lovely
I gotta get it while the getting good brotha
And they always talking that bank shit
But them niggas ain't get no money
And they always talking that pimp shit but them niggas ain't get no cutty
And they stay talking bout that gun shit I lost homeboys to that dumb shit
So When you speak that fake shit my nigga I don't feel that
But on the real they said im bringing that real back
Put a padlock on my style before they steal that
Even a Bitch will get you set up where I live at
Shit so I don't trust these hoes and that's a fact
But Its better safe than sorry so I go in strapped
Yeah I'm talking bout my condom and my lama
Rule number one is death before dishonor
You want the finer things in life, better get to grinding
But God damn dog they reachin for my colar
And I swear like Mary I don't want no drama
Stay high of that marilyn marijuana
Cause in my section I will one day never doubt it
But for that love of that cash them niggas is riding dog
But you can miss me with that fake shit ain't no time for it
Barely send 25 niggas is dying
They coming for my head they want me dead or alive
Uh and it ain't no job most niggas jive
But it's all good I'm in the best shape of my life nigga
And keep up but only if you can
And if you could nigga I speed up I got my first rap check
What I do? reup, you know what they say
They say good weed will cause amnesia and I know how It go
A closed mouth dont eat gotta speak up
I got my money clean but my rap sheet is cleana
And meanwhile I've been tryna duck them evils
Chop it up with dizzle while we smoking on this diesel
But they wouldn't care like been the 
And for that fast money dem niggas hustling like its legal
And for the fast money I swear to god that shit get lethal
And to my old life, farewell mane cause on the real
That shit was living in hell man
Oh
