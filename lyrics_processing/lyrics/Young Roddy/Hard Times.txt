Go 'head and light that shit
Hard times don't ever last long
The block taught me that hard times don't ever last long
The ghetto taught me that hard times don't ever last long

A fool in that kitchen
Been cookin' up like I know magic
Been hustlin' hard; I gotta buy momma that mansion
Was lost for real; I had to go talk to my pastor
Was broke for real; my pockets was flat as a plasma
I peddle so fast, them niggas be peddling backwards
Almost lost my life, but boy that's a whole 'nother chapter
They want that real; I know that they tired of that wack shit
I'm good; my money gettin' bigger, my bitches gettin' badder
I'm fresh out the 'hood; my attitude still like, "whatever"
You can smoke in my ride, but please don't fuck up my leather
I'm bound to get it; bitch-niggas they said I was trippin'
They crazy, they petty; them niggas, they caught in they feelings
Got paper for real; so tall that it's stacked to the ceiling
My cousin in prison; he told me to send him some pictures
I sent him a letter, some money, and told him I miss him
I knew if he would of been free, then he would of been with me

But hard times don't ever last long
The ghetto taught me that hard times don't ever last long
The block taught me that hard times don't ever last long
The ghetto taught me that hard times don't ever last long
I knew if I would of been broke then she wouldn't fuck with me
The block taught me that hard times don't ever last long
I know if I wouldn't have no dough, then she wouldn't fuck with me
The ghetto taught me that hard times don't ever last long
You might also like
Life might throw you a curve, but
Some shit you just can't call
But I do know this: that if you know Phips
You goin' through some shit? Then you can call me, dog
All it takes is a kind word
I'd gladly quote you a proverb
And if that gets you through your days
Don't give me praise, man that's God work
That's real walk, and I live by it and I die by it
Remember we Jets, nigga
When shit look down, we swan-dive it
Man, I make that shit look cold-blooded
Stack that paper till you're holdin' somethin'
Save more than you spend
But still go and treat yourself, cause there's more comin'
My will to win move mountains, homie
Vacate for that drought, homie
Ain't no laggin', I'm proactive
I got kids and they countin' on me
Sometimes when it's lookin' cloudy
Right above it, the sun is shining
Though I pay homage to Muhammad
Don't mean I ain't 'bout my creflo dollar

But hard times don't ever last long
The ghetto taught me that hard times don't ever last long
The block taught me that hard times don't ever last long
The ghetto taught me that hard times don't ever last long
I knew if I would of been broke then she wouldn't fuck with me
The block taught me that hard times don't ever last long
I know if I wouldn't have no dough, then she wouldn't fuck with me
