Uh
They still like how he got a crib and he ain't never there
Still making money in the hood like I ain't never left
I know some cats who kill for freedom
Have to double down
Though I seen it all mama told me not to tattle tale
On the real son that shit'll get you killed son
But me and them we was only trying to chill
I remember being twelve papa let me drink his beer
But I ain't no square I ain't never puffed no squares
I ain't no lame don't you get the wrong idea
I'm no bitch nigga I ain't nothing like them
They same this game ain't fair
I say it is what it is
She went through her mail and seen bill after bill
Uh
She said it's hard for a single mama
She say she got two jobs, shit I see you mama
Uh
I'm like what it take for a kid to win
To transition from a boy to a man
It's the come up
Uh

Time needs money, no matter what those stupid morons who eat that shit up may try and tell you
Anything lost can be found again except for time wasted
Don't you listen to a word I say?
Nigga if I seen't you
Well you don't
So you'd be served to retain some of the knowledge I'm imparting to you rather than giving me all your hard ass street attitude bull shit

Uh
And I stay in my lane I play my part
Never play both sides that can get you knocked off
From a hood where lil' niggas will pull your card
Boy I done had my ups and downs but that made me out a boss
And she said I weren't ever gonna get signed
Put her on my hater catalog I paid her no mind
Remember (?) thatd be turning music down
They say keys open doors
I'm yelling break or break down
I spit fire fool this ain't no false alarm
On the block so hot they ask me how I stay calm
Fly niggas wore some Nike Airs to my prom
And that's word to my mom kept a dime on my arm
A clean nigga with a dirty firearm
Trying to weather this storm and get some money in my palms
But I'm trying to keep them snakes off my lawn
And it feel way better when you make it on your own
It's the come up

Now what kind of player am I?
Am I an offensive man or a defensive man?
Thats right I'm neither
I play my opponent
He likes to attack, I force him to defend himself
A cautious man, I draw him into dangerous waters
See you get so busy frustrated playing defensive positions, you make stupid moves you'd never make if you were thinking
