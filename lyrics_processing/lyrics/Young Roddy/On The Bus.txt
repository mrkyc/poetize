Man nigga daydream about this shit nigga. Even when a nigga was on a bus nigga was thinking about a Maybach nigga

And these niggas ain't flossin', these niggas don't really be on that boss shit
They don't keep it real often, 
Young nigga like me though, I keep it real, get money, fuck hoes blow weed smoke
Everywhere that we go we trying to hit a lick, 
By myself I'll run through a whole zip
You could tell when a nigga never had shit
Pass the bitch after I hit just like some of the killa I just twisted
Master your deliverance, pack it up hit the block and get it in
, One time for my niggas looking at 10
Fuck your bitch til she's short winded
Take your blessings cus the lord sent it
When it's war time we get suited and booted
Old school but that bitch be moving
Where I'm from you gotta pack you a toolie
In Chopper City you can't be stupid
I hit the block like 
Posted up 

My screens fogged cus I'm coming up
Fuck a punch line, I'll fuck you up
Mike Tyson you all welterweights, my sense is good but my life is great
Them pockets straight cus I go and get it
They go and spend it, I go and flip it
Stay changing lanes, I swang and bang
Like Damon Wayans I bring major pain
Now pop that titty outcha mouth boy, Jet life we the new hot boys
Niggas always saying that they jumping off the porch but you never even been up out the house boy
That steak and shrimp I go get that
Check instagram hoe I live that
Straight independent, no advance, sold out shows boy I did that
She inhaling that chronic, swear that pussy the bombest
Gone off gin and that tonic, won't tell nobody I promise
Got a cup full of that yellow and I mixed it up with that red
Hit the city on slow motion still taking joints to my head
Pulling up on your hoe nigga, how you stunt but you owe niggas
Always say what they used to be I don't give a fuck bout you old niggas
This my time you better move around, fuck your shop I'll shut it down
These corny niggas is straight jokes, ain't shit funny about yall clowns

I go dumb, flow stupid, spit retarded, rep New Orleans
A nigga turn a booth to a toilet, I take whatever the world offers
Better yet turn a booth to a coffin, I'm breaking bread with my squadron
Good Lord, Our Father, these niggas killing for Jordans
I never been jealous of that, I got the game from my partner
Trap phone like a hotline nigga, picked up like "place your order"
Small city big dreams, lil homie doing big things
Get rich or die trying, I'm getting paid by all means
Go forwards for the money, I was running like a track team
Or running from a Crown Vic, trying not to get pinched
I used to trap by the trap house, but that was way back in '06
My cousin had 5 bricks and rolled around with a mack 10
Damn them niggas kill at will, but me man I'm just trying to chilly-chill
And I ain't tryna live check to check, then be broke when I pay them bills
Nope, homie don't play that
Eat a slug like Diddy say take that
I dive in that pussy where the safe at
Was on the bus but I'm thinking about a Maybach

She like damn nigga you got 3 phones, a bitch can't get a text back?
I'm like shut the fuck up, I'm all out the plug and bitch I ain't get a pack yet
Nigga fronted me 1, I came back for 3 that's what the fuck I call progress
I got mouths to feed and excuses is some shit we can't digest
I'm in the streets going hard I even prayed to God for a better way
Then my phone ring shit nigga that's another play to make
Out here with these hungry niggas eat your food won't even say grace
Niggas will kill you, carry your casket, look your mom dead in the face
Nah nigga that's ether, I still ride around with grams behind the speaker
Fresh sneakers, I used to beg the  for adidas
I'm fly as Easter, I was cutting class with the seniors
More cash than the teachers, like what the fuck you gonna teach me?
Bitch I got cash flow you only understand if you got cash flow
I got mad hoes I don't ever put up with no mad hoes
I got on 10 chains still grinding like I need 10 more
And that's trill shit, and they don't make real like this no more
OG, I always keep it 100 my nigga
Lil boys need to call me pops the way I be sonning these niggas
I been in these streets on top since niggas had rocks in the matchbox
I been had lawyers on speed dial so they'll eat the case like 
Big bucks no whammies, FM no jamming
 never been no DJ but I always kept my cannon
Little dude but my heart big and I always did get it out the mud
Sometimes I get it off the muscle, other times I get it off the love
I know a few bloods and a few crips so I keep  exclusive
But when you see me I'm solo, 1 gun a few clips
Gangsta's paradise I get a  then I'll pass it on
I'm a little nigga with big money and Ima have mine when yours all gone
I be on my bumpy shit, in the streets tryna make like a mil a day
Hit the hood, smoking good and I'll probably give away like 100k
The feds say that I'm a big fish like  in his prime
These little niggas ain't getting no dollars so they be dropping dimes
