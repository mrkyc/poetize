I still shoot spalding, that's my first love
And its motherfuck the judge, gave my nigga the dub
I know a few niggas got rich by selling drugs
Jack a lame nigga, tell him get it in blood
And now these hoes want to be down all of a sudden
It's rush hour when I work, but I ask my brother
My man Killa Kev he'll kill for nothing

Bitch so bad you can look but don't stare
And here's another hit from me and my nigga Blair
I'm moving on up without no stairs
I wonder where would I be without my scale
They say them real niggas dead or in jail
Had a pocket full of dead prez running from twelve
I ask my dog is there a heaven or a hell
They said I think too much, but they ain't thinking enough
I tried to sell a little weed but I was blazin' it up
But that was back when my mans had to pee in a cup
I think my first girl left cuz I wasn't making enough
My older cousin used to fight me but that made me tough

I still shoot spalding, that's my first love
And its motherfuck the judge, gave my nigga the dub
I know a few niggas got rich by selling drugs
Jack a lame nigga, tell him get it in blood
And now these hoes want to be down all of a sudden
It's rush hour when I work, but I ask my brother
My man Killa Kev he'll kill for nothing

This time I'm going for the gusto, it's all or nothing
It's hot down south, but I still be cooling
I'd probably play Kyle Watson if my life was a movie
And even in the drought I was trapping, keeping it moving
No exaggeration, they told me don't rush greatness
Fuck chasing bitches I'd rather chase that paper
I'm top five dead or alive no debatin'
I'm tryna stay sane, this world will drive you crazy
I'm a good kid, but got a long list of haters
And 365 everyday payday
Empty a whole clip for nigga AJ
Yea I paint pictures like that nigga JJ
I got them young niggas grinding like that nigga Ray Ray
Like OG Bobby Johnson, them niggas ain't playing
Yea I used to be that nigga selling nickel bags
It's us against the world, just me and my lady
There's no days off yea I hustle daily
But my bitch so bad you can look but don't stare
And here's another hit from me and my nigga Blair

I still shoot spalding, that's my first love
And its motherfuck the judge, gave my nigga the dub
I know a few niggas got rich by selling drugs
Jack a lame nigga, tell him get it in blood
And now these hoes want to be down all of a sudden
It's rush hour when I work, but I ask my brother
