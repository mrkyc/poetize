I flow water, Bobby Boucher
Bout time I introduce them to they doomsday
Uh, I flow water, Bobby Boucher
I swear these rap nigga's as sweet as Kool-Aid
But them boys know that they whack
Them boys know they ain't real
Them boys know I spit crack
Them boys know what it is
Alright, let me stop fuckin' around, hold this down for my set
Jet Life, ever since Route The Ruler, they been calling me the truth
I use to have a hooptie, til Spitta loaned me his coupe
I finally got an iPhone, use to be team boost
But it made me hella money, boy my shoe box the proof
I grew up in the hood where nigga's reppin' soowoop
Wear a whole lotta red, but still bump that uncle Snoop
Ain't never claimed thug, always tried to play it cool
But if it's motherfuck me, then definitely motherfuck you
And I try to them school nigga's, it's crazy cause they don't listen
They prolly way to broke, way too broke to pay attention
This architect shit, I been busy building by business
Been humble way too long, now I'm stuntin' on them bitches
It's me against the world, shit I'm such a bold nigga
And dear summer, it's gonna be a cold winter
A different broad every night, that's what you call pimpin'
And this raw talent that I got ain't nothing but God given
That bomb head that she give, she could charge nigga's
A boss nigga, doin' it for my dogs nigga
Every track they put me on, then we go off nigga
Yeah, straight off nigga, talkin' JR nigga, preach
I might be too real for mainstream
I'm tryin' keep my rap sheet clean
But they don't feel me, ya'mean
My people gotta eat, I'm tryin' touch some legal cheese
I got a bitch that's on my team, she hustle just like me
I keep a jersey for her, remember that one night they tried to murc your boy
Remember bein' wanted, cops searchin for em'
They say they gotta cell or a hearse for em'
My homie say they got some pounds or some birds for em'
My eye's cherry red, like my birth stone
I remember postin' up, gettin' that work off
Can they say holla back, don't you take too long
Be back in 24 hours, that's what I do boy
Cause I ain't never been no duck nigga, no bitch nigga, no fuck nigga
I do this shit for my hood nigga
My crip niggas, my blood niggas
Them cap peelers, them thug niggas
Them drug dealers, them jack boys
You know, them boys who keep them tooli's on them
Uh, hey, you know I kept that toolie on me
I can't lie, I thank God for that motherfuckin' boost mobile
Used to be ridin' round with my smokin' with my nigga 
Talkin' bout makin' mad money
Bumpin' that Styles P
Had that heater under the seat
Don't believe me, just ask somebody nigga
Like, flow water, Bobby Boucher
