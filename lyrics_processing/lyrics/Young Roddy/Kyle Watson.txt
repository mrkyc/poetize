And I finally got my dream in my palm, and I can't let go
In a class by my self, when I speak, I hear those echo's.
These wack ass rapper's gassed, no petrol
I walk it like I talk it in my retro's
In the back seat of my older cousins car, they bumpin' Esco, or either bumpin' Jay's shit, but now they bumpin' my shit
I'm trying to get it poppin', paper always been my topic
That money in my mind, it's in my bank, and on my counter
That weed all on my scale, it's in my joint, and in my grinder
And Like Mekhi Phifer off of clockers, I was clocking
So can a nigga ball, Kyle Watson
These thirsty ass broads trying there best to count my pocket
But, ain't no time for gossip, I'm to busy counting profit
It's funny how they hopped off, and they hop back on my dick
It's funny how another nigga bitch all in my mix
It's funny how I used to wear my homeboys kicks
Crazy how I come from piss poor, to hood rich
Ugh, aye, but can I live? I hope they let me
Im bugging out like Clyde
Barrow, or Joe Pesci
I'll never chang, I'll remain the same if they let me
Marley told me, if I want it, to go get it
Clearly this little nigga, big business
Illen, for that money, I started sinning
Silly of a nigga, hope he forgive me
Just hope that I ain't speaking to low, so he don't hear me mane
I said I'm hoping I ain't speaking to low, so he don't hear me mane
You might also likeUgh. Music saved my life, that ain't no question
Riding like a 187, me and my bredren, ugh!
On a quest to get this cheddar
Maby they'd do better, if they knew better, but they dont five a fuck, so my attitude's what ever
Thinking level headed, even when I'm on my level
We all on a hunt to get this treasure
Either you a buyer or a seller, a Jet nigga stay fly in any weather
