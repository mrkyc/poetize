They stay selling that

Them niggas can't keep up
I hustle for my income
They don't know what I've been through
They don't know where I come from
I wake up so early, so early I beat the sun up
I saw niggas get wet up
They ran up and got done up
I left that bullshit in the past
I'm on my come up
But speaking bout my past
I hid that work by the dump truck
I got two snow bunnies
They love me, they live in Boston
Fucked em at the same time
Real talk, I ain't lyin'
Got liquor on my breathe
Got money on my mind
If they ain't talking 'bout no money
Watch how fast they get declined
My lungs straight collapse from smokin that la la la
Woke up in that hospital bed
She was right there by my side
But hard times don't last long
I guess she my backbone
And if all else fails
It's back to that trap phone
Riding with a pretty bitch
Trying to make a pretty penny
Car smellin like piffy
Got two ounces of that sticky, nigga

They stay selling that

Now who got it? Who got it?
That's me, my nigga
Had to hustle for the loot
Ain't shit free, my nigga
My OG told me keep it G, lil nigga
That's fucked up, man the feds
Trying to keep my nigga
But fuck the world and I mean it
Freedom of speech, my nigga
Know a girl who like girls
And she don't need no nigga
That's some cold ass shit
Fuck it, that ain't my biz
Boy that ain't my ho
Shit, I don't save no bitch
I play the game how it go
I'm trying to raise my kids
Soon as you get you some dough
Them niggas aim at your wig
I used to be hella broke
Until I got on my shit
Stacked me up a lil change
Them bitches hopped on my dick
I'm trying to stack some paper like Puffy
It's hard living 'round these crabs in a bucket
I used to have a pocket full of dimes
