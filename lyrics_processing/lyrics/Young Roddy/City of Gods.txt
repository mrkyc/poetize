And ain't shit sweet, shit real in the ghetto
Boy them kids totin' steel in the ghetto
They even got kids havin' kids in the ghetto
My model bitch ask me how I live in the ghetto
She told me that its all fucked up
She just calls it how she see it, me I say its tough love
She don't even smoke, I taught her how to roll up
Now she finally understands why I'm smoking so much
And I only went to college for a month
Ditchin' class I was in the parkin' lot smoking blunts
Money called the phone, I answered like what up?
Cause real talk I ain't never got paid to give a fuck
And when them shots bust, them niggas better duck
Cause they ain't got no game and they don't care who they wet up
Hey, ask my step pop, he tell you what up
I was back and forth in and out the house making runs
Shit I was trying to make some money on my own
Got my first piece of pussy, nigga thinking that he grown
And I always knew I'd make it to the league
I had hoop dreams but that shit wasn't always what it seems
Man the shit so ill in the ghetto
They even got kids takin' pills in the ghetto
Feelin' like the devil on my heels in the ghetto
Wondering how the hell I'm gonna get rich in this ghetto
Because this nine to five just ain't cuttin' it
I'm just another black brother hustlin'
Just another brother who them haters don't fuck with
Probably cause I spit that good sense, no dumb shit
I tried to warn them ignorance is bliss
Nigga know Kung-Fu, they in the hood choppin' bricks
She caught lock jaw, I caught lock wrist
From stirrin' up that shit, trying to get hood rich
I'm trying to make some real bread
But they don't know about it
I got his bitch up in my bed
But he don't know about it
I have to straighten out my act, I'm getting sloppy
I used to dream about getting it, now I got me
And I admit I might be hooked on chronic
Your girl straight wilin' she want to fuck in the lobby
It's fuck the other side, I'm just trying to do Roddy
And I bought a black gat but I ain't trying to murk nobody
Lord, I swear I smell fire in the ghetto
They even got kids sellin' pounds in the ghetto
A full time job tryin' to stay alive in the ghetto
Trying to get your money up but it go down in the ghetto
Uh
You might also likeOutro x2
Let that bitch breathe for a minute
I can get it if you hit it, if you tyring to make a purchase
I don't talk on cell phones, boy that shit make me nervous
Got a trunk full of yola, in the car with no insurance
Got a bitch who work for me, she baggin' up service
Trying to work that dirty money but momma don't have detergent
Let that bitch breathe for a minute
Uh, life
