The definition of a nigga balling


Real shit, my nigga whip broke down, I be back on the bus, we used to ride on chrome
My brother got life, man that hurt me to my heart, he ain't never coming home
Trapped in the ghetto, boy I bet I make it out, I be damned if I dont
Riding in a bucket, had a pocket full of money with them thangs in the trunk
But my homie daddy showed us how to cook up that yay
Try an make new money every damn day
My knees fucked up from how much a nigga pray
Boy I sleep when I die I ain't never take a break
They couldn't get me off my grizzly,
My momma woulda killed me if she caught me in the kitchen
Fuckin with her pots, let me stop she might be listening
I wasn't tryina beef I was tryina start a business
I met my nigga Zoe we was all in
I swear I seent it all on that park bench
In a drought that money slow like Paul Pierce
Used to be a worker, now a nigga on his boss shit
Had 36 O's of that raw shit
Plug sent a text, Told that nigga that its all good
Treat a pack like a bitch boy I ran through it
Stack that money tall, stretch it out like Rashard Lewis
My nigga Zoe turned the crib to a trap spot
Real trap boy shit I coulda been a mascot
Everyday they shootin dice, or they slap box
Shit every day they smokin weed or puffin crack rock
Tryina get rich but Im speaking for the have nots
No bank account but I keep my money Pad Locked
Coke so strong prolly make a fiend pass out
Hood so hot boy Id rather play the back lot
And I dont care if they wanna Ounce, man my nigga B.I.G said never sell outcha house
I remember running from the cops
Tried to dish my gun, but my clip dropped out
I remember gassing the whip, nigga took a lil trip and came home with them blocks
Only had a dollar and a dream, but forsure a  nigga turned them dollars to knots
Sinning like I never got Baptized
Had so much work that I had to take a cab ride
Thought I had it planned out, almost hit the jackpot
Thought I had it mapped out but that shit back fired
They better hold on cause they slippin
Might catch a hollow tip standing next to them niggas
Them 20's and them 50's my money machine clickin
I'm the definition of a nigga ballin
I done seen it all
