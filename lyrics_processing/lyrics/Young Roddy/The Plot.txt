And if it don't obtain no money then holler clown
I'm rich, my flight, you know my style
Any time I blink I swear I see dollar signs
I'm a self made nigga, you know my kind
Hope my girl keep it trill and stay real when I'm not around
Cause we are all we got so hold it down
Uh, and it's tre-first till I die man
And it's still mother fuck that other side man
And I still got my eyes on that prize and that money on my mind with a bad bitch in my ride man
And I'm still train smoking on that loud man
And I wrote this in my section eight housing
From a spot with drugs, cops, and robbers
From a goose egg, to a hundred, to some thousands
And I'm steady brainstorming, plotting
Uh, hopped off the porch like what's popping, nigga

From sun down to sun up, I'm plotting on my come up
You know, you know
From sun down to sun up, I'm plotting on my come up, oh
You know
From sun down to sun up, I'm plotting on my come up
You know, you know
From sun down to sun up, I'm plotting on my, oh

Cough up a lung, where the fuck I come from
No loot will make a nigga go nuts
It's a dog eat dog world, a pussy will get fucked
Making money in the rush definitely gave me a rush, nigga
I've been grinding since Diddy was named Puff, nigga
I'm just a little nigga who's doing shit deluxe
Not that I give a fuck but what's the love nigga
And these thirsty ass bitches on the hunt
But still ain't nothing without ? nigga
Mama want a winner not no runner up
So fuck an up coming, I'm coming up, nigga
And I'd be selfish not to give them what they want
Uh, shit but still I can't front, fuck, cause I ain't done much
But travel the world on our tour bus in two months
I'm just a young nigga who's trying to come the fuck up
What the fuck
