And everybody on the block wan' shine like Stunna
I'm stunting like Baby on 'em, I'm stunting like Baby on 'em
I hustled the whole winter just to shine for the summer
Hustled the whole winter just to shine for the summer
I'm stunting like Baby on 'em, I'm stunting like Baby on 'em

Uh
I never told her that I love her, even though I did (word)
Small city, little homie, tryna do it big (big)
I'm no Muslim though they told me not to fuck with pigs (uh-uh)
This ain't bowling, I ain't tryna hit the pin (trying to hit the pin)
I'm trying to strike gold and trying to get rich (Amen)
Shit you'll either want a Bentley or a Benz (or a Benz)
I had a Biggie poster taped to my wall (to my wall)
I watched my cousin hustle, guess it rubbed off (get that dough)
Couldn't watch my momma struggle, had to get involved
So I pushed packs, made them backflip, summersault
Real nigga, never put no bitch before my dogs
But on a rough day, she the one who know just what I want (true)
Came to the door without no panties or no bra
So sweet, so fine, make you wanna hit it raw, but heck naw
Tell them hating cats who hope I fall off, fuck ya'll
Tell my ex-broad "bitch that's your loss"

Uh
And my homie, he hit me up, he told me to come and get him
But, I'm on a mission, goddamn I'm on a mission
Tired of them hungry nights, Goddamn I gotta get it
It left a ring in my tub, that dirty money so filthy
I don't even drink but tonight I'm on that Henny
I'm tired of that hot block, fool, I'm trying to see something different
Trying to travel the world, you know, break my pimping
I'm trying to break this curse, Lord, don't let them demons near me
Living life carefree, they told me that stress kill
Tell me patience the key, but Lord they still don't hear
I say a prayer for the victim, they bust shots at the witness
So much shit on my mental, I'm high like Jimi Hendrix
Uh, I drive Porsches for the days I couldn't afford it
Uh, I smoke ganja for the days I was without it
Uh, I push the pedal to the floor in my '64
Stuntin' on them niggas, like fuck them other niggas
And everybody on the block wan' shine like Stunna
Everybody on the block wan' shine like Stunna
I'm stunting like Baby on 'em, I'm stunting like Baby on 'em
I hustled the whole winter just to shine for the summer
Hustled the whole winter just to shine for the summer
I'm stunting like Baby on 'em, I'm stunting like Baby on 'em
And everybody on the block wan' shine like Stunna
Everybody on the block wan' shine like Stunna
I'm stunting like Baby on 'em, I'm stunting like Baby on 'em
I hustled the whole winter just to shine for the summer
Hustled the whole winter just to shine for the summer
I'm finally stunting like Baby on 'em, finally stunting like Baby on 'em
Like

It's like ya'll had me in this motherfucker all day
Playing with my motherfucking people
And I fuck with real niggas and soldiers
But I got enough brains and enough change to take both these bitches life
So send me where I came from
Put me in the jungle where I need to be at
