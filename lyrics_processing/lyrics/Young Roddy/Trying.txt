And I'm just trying to get rich my nigga
Uh, riding round with my tooley
Sipping on that Bobby Brown
Rest in peace to Big Hooley
Rest in peace to Michael Brown
Hands up and my face down
But the cops might still shoot me
I gave the world my lifestory
But they still don't know Route The Ruler
Damn
I'm just trying to stay focused
Tired of seeing my niggas caged
And I know they tired of that (?)
Been grinding way too long, god damn
I'm just trying to get over, trying hide my pain
Shit, just hope nobody don't notice
They try and kill my pride
Man they try to fuck me over
Got a gold chain on my neck
I got a stone chip on my shoulder
I'm a trill nigga, thats trill shit
My mama raised a soldier
My pops left, told me I'd comprehend when I got older
Boy what that is, that ain't good sense
Boy fuck that shit
I'm a hood nigga, that hood shit in my blood
Say a prayer for a real nigga, they say the good die young
A bitch nigga get jacked quick, but I ain't never jacked my plug
All they know is sippin' that Henny, all we know is smokin' on blunts
I fell off like a few times but I got my money back up
Man they love it when you piss poor
Shit they hate to see you come up
They hate it when you bounce back
Got mad loot I started from scratch
All we know is flippin' that what?
All we know is shippin' them packs
I thank God for this rap shit, I came a long way from that trap
The devil always workin, almost knocked me off my track
Got a bad bitch on the West Coast and she always smokin' that gas
I beast mode in that pussy, she came first and I came last
Got a hot bitch on the East Coast, her head fire, she deepthroat
She strip to make a little extra, say she got money but need more
But ain't nothing like a Southside bitch who was raised up on that G-code
She smoke good, she fuck good, bitch even wrap them kilos
She learned it from her brother
Told me if she ever need man she'll whack a nigga no frontin'
Shorty thats my niggas, yah, shorty keep it one hundred
She compliment my hustle, she the extra piece to my puzzle
If you dont feel me then fuck ya
Uh
But pardon my French my niggas
I'm just trying to get rich my nigga
Its Jet Life to my next life
Bitch its Jet Life to my next life
Better straighten up, she better straighten up
This bitch losing her balance
She trying to get to my castle, she wanna fuck a nigga on camera
Soo-woo, 31st I do my shit for that Manor
I was raised round that red rag
If you bitch made then you a dead man
Jigga gave you that Blueprint, me I gave you that Good Sense
I only talk mathematics, Spitta gave you that Stoned Immaculate
Uh
I'm just trying to get rich my nigga
Bitch pardon my French my nigga
Its Jet Life to my next life
