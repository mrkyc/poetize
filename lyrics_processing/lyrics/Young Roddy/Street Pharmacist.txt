Mama told me stay humble

And I try to stay out the mix but its easy to get in trouble
I'm comin' up hella quick my mama told me stay humble
I'm buzzin off of this reefer, no molly get on my level
Another kid from the ghetto who used to pump at the telly
Trapped in the belly of the beast god help me
Obese I'm only tryna eat ya'll feel me
So will I make it out before them haters try to kill me
Or them cops try to nail me talkin' reckless on the celly
Throw away the key and lock a nigga' wit a "celly"
In a cell this is hell, man that shit will never fail
Been workin' off my tail shake the dirt under my nails
Street Pharmacist with no diploma from Yale
I'mma street general it shouldn't be hard for you to tell
That I'm almost there I can feel it in the air
If you ain't got no fresh kicks them hoes'll call you square
But that was back then when they didn't want me
Now them hoes all on me
And if I get some beats from Ye and make my tape
I wouldn't have been able to cop my rolly with that big face
Or been baby to buy my beemer with that template
But im so underground way underground im hood bound
That little block in Kenner city where you cats could find me
I shipped it off and got paid since lefted Johnny
I shot Spalding ballin' was my hobby
They shot two but only to catch behind me
Thats wicked, they lost they minds and can't find it
Ignant for a little paper they wild'n
Sicknin' they hoping I'll flop like Vloddy
Gettin' it shit everybody eatin' in my squadron
Take your favorite rapper make lames about him
I get the baddest bitches and get brains about em'
Yeah.. Im piffin' till im gone I know thats wrong
But back them they didn't want me know them hoes all..
They lost in this world I hope the Lord got em' tho
They said I 'possed to be dead a long time ago
I cannonballed in that money, Geronimo
I stand tall in that pussy wit no problem tho
And me no leprechaun just searchin' for my pot of gold
I serve cliental like holla back, adios
From duckin' public cameras to cameos
I serve grams for grands they don't hear me tho
But as I spread my wings and straighten my halo
I'm tryna make my ends meet im bout my payroll
But for them pesos they leave yo shirt tomato
So get low and its still fuck them a holes
Them niggas can't hold me shout out to O.J. Mayo
Them niggas can't guard me shout out to James Harden
And all this slick dissin' only make me go harder
But fuck em'
