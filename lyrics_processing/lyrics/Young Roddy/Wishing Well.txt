Uh, started with nothing, story about the roller
Thought the road with no jam, made us work the Martin Luther
Never get caught in my feelings
There's Biggie getting that cold G
This for them nights I was starving
So tired of ramen noodles
Never get stuck in no true
I tell you just 'bout my past
Now they call me the future
Never been with confusion
Daddy's is taking that moben
I brought my sister her toilet, I pray she never use it
Truth be told, I'd be dead and gone if it wasn't for music
On a road to the richest, started out and I hooped it
Kush shit living with niggas shooting, I ain't talking hooping
No lie them niggas ruthless, she suck it just like she toothless
Now I'm stunting these niggas
All these niggas my junior
Fuck a vest in my city, them boys ain't match your coffee
I swear this more than music
I tell you my life like a movie
I coulda been a blue chip
But this one for the crew though
'Cause they know I in good sense
They hopped up off that good shit, no bullshit
They young gods spending from the poor pit
Like God bless, they say the squad next
But I say we right now
What's a better time to drop another bomb like funk flex?
Made it out the projects where cops never protect
The damn thing, hold up, she tryna get my last name
But hold on this bitch, wanna rhyme before this cash came
Oh Lord, I jumped off the porch into the fast lane
Selling all the young dope, I'm still in the crack game
I know some killers who don't mind killing
I'm boss like Max Payne
Tell them niggas ain't for the stars
But they got bad aim
Body everybody, I put that shit on the rap game
Toss a quarter in the wishing will
Shit ain't work, my nigga still in jail
I'm talking for many years
That's cold turkey
My homie got hooked on that tony, he nose first
I guess he soul searching
Hard time, had to see him breakfast at dinner
No heat up in his crib, had to bundle up for the winter
I murder any nigga who put his hand on my sister
If they lock me up I'm like 'who the fuck'll come visit?'
Guess I'm uncommon
Niggas in the courthouse, singing like cold timers
Even in the dark I be shining like blood diamonds
Gotta keep that rocking
I'm feeling like Joe Johnson
No time for the nonsense
You might also likeGood sense
I guess I'm uncommon
