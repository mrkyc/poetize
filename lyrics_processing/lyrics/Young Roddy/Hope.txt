Surprised I ain't jumped over the ledge already
Uncommon, ay
They want that real shit but I don't think they ready

Uh, born with a strike one feeling already
Shots rained out, somebody call the paramedics
Trapped in the hood where they riding round ginning
How many make it out? Nigga, not too many
White man shot, they dead already
Shot thing jump over the ledge already
Surprised I ain't make it to the feds already
Surprised I ain't catch a murder case already
They want that real shit but I don't think they ready
Got kids that they tryna put some foot in their belly
Even when the sky gram cry, make a pretty penny
Young lies on me feeling like Machiavelli but
Small thing took shine it's no biggy
Feeling like Bruce Lee when i kick it
Sorry, ain't shit, sweep up my swisher
Said the blind lead the blind, no vision
Uncommon, yeah

It is what it is, I'ma tell it like it is
Man, they tell you keep it real but they never keep it real
I'm uncommon
I try to keep the peace
But I gotta keep a piece in the belly of the best
Work my hard on my sleep
Uncommon

Caught with the strap so you got two felons
They don't give a fuck, living like fellas
Give hope to the hood but they don't give you no credit
How many homies dead? Nigga, way too many
White man shot, they encaged already
Wonder why my shirt didn't turn red already
Surprised I ain't never get tased already
Probably wonder why I ain't never get slaved already
Two tears in the bucket, man it's pain way heavy
It's us against the world, hoping all my niggas ready
Come from living with his girl now ain't living with a celly
Wondering will he make it home safe? Ain't no telling
Who the fuck are them guests? Ain't nothing let it
I ain't never had shit, why they jealous?
Took a L but I'm counting my blessings
