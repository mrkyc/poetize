My brother, I could probably win in a shit talking competition
I'm young Juvie when I win the moon walking competition
I'm MJ when it comes to my competition
Gimme the mic or I'll jack son
Don't try to hit me with a case cause I'll beat it like Michael Jackson
Take notes, no rhymes in the composition
My lyrical composition comes from off the cranium
Fuck killing beats, man I'm slaying em
And to my opposition, I know they ain't playing em
They say I can't spit but its like, I'm missing my front teeth
Tryna say I bite, don't front me
Don't flex homie, because you're not a rock like you think
I'm like the second track of Indicud
Man, my eyes low, I'm on the bud, must be Indica
So fly, I mean high feeling like a man on the moon
I'm so gone but I might land soon
November 8th, boy I'm a maven
I'm amazing, and I'm changing
Cause it makes better sense, but I'll never ever change what I represent
When I'm done, you'll look back in retrospect
Like damn, he just blessed the set
Damn hit yo girl up, yeah I just sent the text
Sippin in some Tex, hold em and set the deck
Dont need no X, I found my mark
You think you ballin' just because you hang in the park
A lot of people taking shots hoping I reply to make them relevant
I just read their comment and say the hell with it
I'm heaven sent so no
Need to pray for me, pray to me
And if you ain't love me, stay the hell away from me
I ain't no dummy
I run my shit you just chasing me
Keanu Reeves I got that speed
Paul Westerberg, ain't no replacing me
Hearing talking, don't tell a soul, I just let it be
IFYB, that's where I'll ever be, damn
You might also like
And you thought I was finished but I'm right back in it
Like the drawers of these women
Yeah shouts to Lil Weezy
Toking on that, you know what, got me feeling a little wheezy
And I'm coughing like the Pokemon
No Pokemon, man
Better cut the shit boy, you ain't relevant
Cut the check this ain't Nike come and fight me

Ugh, Gucci x3

Ask me for a feature cause you got struggle bars hoping that I can bail you out
But I don't give a fuck man, run up in the function
You a hoe man, I should sell you out
Nah that don't make sense, probably wouldn't even make any profit
Man, I'm a motherfucking prophet
Got that dollar incentive
Damn, I'm with your mama and I'm in it
Damn, Gucci FlipFlops and I'm in it to win it
Cut the shit boy, I ain't no fucking play toy
I'm just with your girl and I'm acting like her play toy
Man, I'm just goofing off on this last part, killed the rest of it
