You should've been here for the night
Mean, I could fuck you right
Just don't look up in my eyes
Cause I know you're gonna see something that you don't wanna see
And find some reason to be disappointed in me, girl
You should've been here for the night
I could've fucked you right
But instead you running around with some other guy, damn
Having the time of your life
And I'm just counting money
WIth my other honeys, reason why you don't love me
Cause I got other honeys, yeah
Man, should've been here for the night
I'm a piece of shit, but I still treat you right
When I get the chance, yeah, when I get the chance we can roll the dice
Should've been here tonight, girl
Rather be with you

Rather be with you, but you are not around
So Imma call someone else and see if they'd be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, yeah I hate sleeping alone
If I call her, we gon be fucking
Reason why you don't trust me
Don't be judging, but if I call her, she gon be fucking
Reason why you don't trust me
I'm just being truthful, sorry if you don't love me, girl
I hate sleeping alone

Damn girl, why you always acting like you bleeding for me

Damn girl, you gon ride til you die, oh
But you should've been here for the night
'Cept you were with some other guy

But I still rather be with you than all these other whores that I'm ready to screw like a DJ
Damn, bout to get me a BJ but I'm still thinking about you

See I rather be with you, but you are not around
So Imma call one of your friends and see if they'd be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, cause I hate sleeping alone

And we're here and we're both so gone
Should've been here for the night

Cause I know you're gonna see something you won't like
And find some reason to be disappointed in me
Hate sleeping alone, yeah I hate sleeping alone
