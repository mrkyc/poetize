Gucci, Gucci

From the south where they often use word of oppression
Then claim its not offensive, they ain't trying to oppress em
From a place where its not uncommon to have depression or at least not for me
Because I've seen some shit happen
Shit I rarely speak on when I'm rapping
I've seen girls go from straight edge and straight A's, thinking that maybe they'd succeed
To sucking D for some E, in a split second
F it, not trying to spit a corny message
This ain't no conscious shit, this just some clearing this shit off my chest and conscience shit
And I could never deal keys, couldn't handle the guilt
Cocaine castles, never fit for the build
I mean would never be able to pay the bills
And a couple people act like they know me, and think that we're really homies
But they don't really know shit, they don't know what I really hold in, damn
Lately I've been feeling kinda down, kinda bum
Oh well, I'm not really, not really worry about that cause where I'm from
I know I still got homies on me, 30 for 30 look like my whole team with me
Might need a 30 for 30 damn I need a big ring with me
Look like I'm Mike Tyson with a big ring with me, damn
I might just slip off this serious shit and start joking again
I mean, what I mean joking? Imma start talking about poking again, damn
I heard the beat and had to be serious, I mean damn are you hearing this
I couldn't do that joke shit over this, nah
I couldn't do that fake shit over this
Had to do that great shit over this
Had to do my Drake shit over this
Had to clear my chest, of some bullshit
I mean I know a couple people are full of it
From straight A's to a junkie
Man that shit ain't even funny
I seen that shit happen, shit wild
I'm rapping about this, I usually don't
I'm usually on some joke shit but right now I'm, I had to get some shit off my chest
Just had to get some shit off my chest
But I still got the whole team with me like a 30 for 30
Damn, every song I make, yeah this is like what 30 or 30
Everything's a hit, I mean everything I spit becomes a hit, holy shit, damn
I from a place where, someone gets pregnant, they say "What'd you expect?
Did you see the color her skin was? Did you see just how her friend was?
Damn she ended up just like her friend, and just like..."
Man nah that's just some stereotypes, I don't rock with that
I know a couple people who ain't gon make it to graduation to rock that cap
Damn, I'm just trying to make it big so I can rock that ice
Or at least to where I'll know where Imma sleep every night
I'm usually on my joke shit but this time I'm serious
Because I heard the beat and was like damn are you hearing this
I can't be funny on this shit, I gotta be serious
I gotta express some shit, because it's been on my chest
I've been waiting for the moment, hoping that you're enjoying this
But I dunno, you probably think it's corny because it ain't
It ain't that Gucci FlipFlops that you're used to
Used to me rapping about "Oh damn girl I used you, damn girl I'm just trying to fuck you
Damn girl, I don't really want you"
But took a second to open up and now the song's closing up, damn
And you know what's up
