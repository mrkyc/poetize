I'm a spiritual individual that's lyrical with miracles
I know I'm killing you with my lyrical spiritual miracles, I'm killing you, yeah
You know you can't handle me, I'm spitting, I'm spitting
I'm getting up in it, I'm spitting, I'm spitting
I'm a lyrical miracle, lyrical miracle spiritual individual
My peripheral,  I'm extra terrestrial
I'm ripping you, got you girl up in the rest room, of the best room, of the bed room
I'm killing you like serial, I'm so sick, I need clinical
This is critical, why you so cynical
I think you need psychical, I'm just in the pinnacle
Of my career, this is typical, damn
I'm so round this is spherical
Spherical miracle, miracle, clerical
Elliptical, is what you run on
I'm in that ethereal, historical
Rhetorical questions, political
The miracle, analytical, categorical
Egotistical is what I am, empirical
Hypocritical is what you are, metaphorical is what I am
Stereotypical is what you are, miracle is what I am
Typical is what you are
Critical is what I am
