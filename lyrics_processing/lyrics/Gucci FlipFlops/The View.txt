Damn girl I need to be with you
When I'm looking at this fucking view x2

I'm on top of the rap game, damn
Every since then, it's not the same
If You're Reading This I Fucked Your Bitch
Everything is going crazy, goddamn
I mean every different night I got a new lady, goddamn
What the Fuck is Going On, it's Gucci FlipFlops all on this other song
Uh, bouncing that ass like it was ball for some pong
Man I'm feeling like I could do nothing wrong
But I don't really know, cause I don't love these hoes
But what the fuck ever, man I'm still young, so I might just go fuck this bitch named Heather
Like the pornstar, know how that shit goes
I don't love these hoes, I say that a lot
I always stay down for my bros, bros before hoes
But hoes before bros when it comes to getting pussy, you know how that shit goes
Stay down, stay down like a frown
I stay down with my sound, know how that goes
Like I'm soundcloud, man my sound is like I'm on a fucking cloud when I'm playing it
Damn, I'm so high up when I'm playing, it's like I'm on a cloud, when I'm listening music call it a soundcloud
And I'm blowing that loud like always
I'm on that mound, I'm pitching to your girl, and she loving it
I give her the curve after we're done fucking it
Yeah you know how that shit goes, Gucci FlipFlops I'm using that Milo flow
Well kinda, I don't really know how to do it
But I might just see if I can do it
Uh, calling up your bitch, ask if she can come on over to see this view from my crib
Yeah, calling if she can see this view from my crib
Look at the morning dew while she sip some mountain dew
Cause she's a country bitch, she's a country bitch but I love it
She's a country bitch but I love that shit
She's a country bitch but I fucked your bitch
Lit like bic, in her pussy, muy fuego, lit like bic
Then I lick like clit, *blaw*, man there goes that click
I'm always down for my motherfucking clique
IFYB you know where I be, yeah that shit true
Gucci FlipFlops, girl I need you to come and look at this view
