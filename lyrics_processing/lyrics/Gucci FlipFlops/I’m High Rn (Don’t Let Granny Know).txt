High right now, hoping my granny don't find out
Saying that she proud, what would she say if she knew I was on the loud x2

High right now

Pull up to an opp right now

Krok in the game, we taking yo shit
Fuck yo bitch, I'ma fuck yo bitch
Take her shit, I'ma take her shit
She sucking my dick and she poppin em vics

Skipping class just to chill in the trap
A nigga in the kitchen whipping up that crack

All these guns, I'm hella twisted
All this money, I'm hella gifted
Bad bitch, she better suck it

All this kush now let's smoke it
All this coke now let's sniff it

All this white widow up in my chest
Got me coughing out all these fucking spider webs, goddamn
Short motherfucker but I ball, bitch I'm Spud Webb
Smoking on the weed while I'm sipping alcohol
Hear my phone ring but it's just my grandma calling
Ignore that shit, hang up quick
Cause she can hear it in my voice
Goddamn, smoke out, toked out, loced out, chilling with the boys
And saying that she wanna come over, praying I get sober
Cause my eyes are fucking red, and my brain is fucking dead
And my mind is fucking fried, man wishing I was dead because I was dead when she arrived
Yeah knocking asking if she can come inside
Smell it on my shirt, saying blame it on someone else
