White Pac, White Pac, White Pacquiao
I pack and I pack and I pack the loud
And it packs and it packs and it packs a punch
Take your ass to school, better pack a lunch
You know and you know whats up yeah x2

I'm chilling and bumping Post Malone
Your bitch loves the smell of my cologne
I'm a new breed of hippy, never hipster
But your bitch is, love to make her hip stir
Go shopping like which store, should I buy out
Like a contract man I buy out, Imma
I'm on the court, watch me ball out
I'm from the south, no gold in my mouth
This girl can't want till I get home
This bitch says I'm a dog and she wants to bone
Call me snoop, fucked the bitch doggy style
Leaped in that pussy like a froggy style
I do a show then I get some blow
Then I get some girls who want some blow
You already know, yeah you already know man
Guuuuuccci
Yeah it's that Gucci Flipflops
Aka Versace Thongs, just bought a Versace bong
Im smoking loud, your weed don't make a sound
Mine so turnt it needs a Soundcloud
From the south, where they wear gold in their mouths
But I don't, mines in my pockets
I'm in a league of my own
Leader of the home, closed the door and locked it
You might also like
I pack and I pack and I pack the loud
I'm White, I'm White, I'm White Pacquiao
And it packs and it packs and it packs a punch
Take your ass to school, better pack a lunch
You know and you know and you know whats up
White Pac, White Pac, White Pacquiao
I pack and I pack and I pack the loud
And it packs and it packs and it packs a punch

Got the loud back, pack the loud, Pacquiao
I never fall but if I do I'll bounce back
Like a bouncey ball
You dont bounce at all
Like my girls that can bounce
King of the jungle, when I see the pussy I pounce
Sipping lean back to back, ounce to ounce
I'm cashing out, with all my dough
Start, I should start a bakery and hire Anita Baker
Make brownies, and bake her
Never been a player, but I'm balling
I'm the leader, shot calling
Always on point like a point guard
My whole squad full of shooting guards
We the center of attention, when we hit the club we pay it forward
On the clouds, can you feel the tension
Man got the gun, he'll spray it forward
Dropped the weed in the floorboard
We swerving like big sean, I'm the big don
My girls likes a big dong, ring her gong like a gong
Yeah it's Lord Pretty Motherfucking Gucci, you already knew me
Girl like Smurffete she already blew me
Record it and put it on a Blu-Ray
Bout to have more nicknames than Tunchei
And 2 Chainz
In the booth so much, I could drop a new project every Tuesday
White Pac, White Pac, White Pacquiao
And I pack and I pack and I pack the loud
And it packs and it packs and it packs a punch
Take your ass to school, better pack a lunch
You know and you know and you know whats up yeah
I pack and I pack and I pack the loud
White Pac, White Pac, White Pacquiao
And it packs and it packs and it packs a punch
Take your ass to school, better pack a lunch
And you know and you know, yeah you know whats up
White Pac, White Pac, White Pacquiao
And I pack, I pack, I pack the loud
And it packs, it packs, it packs a punch
Take your ass to school, gotta pack a lunch
