Don't fall in love with me
Cause once you know the real me
You won't be in love with me
Don't fall in love with me
Cause once you know the real me
You won't be in love with me

Don't fall in love with me
When we're done you won't want to be in touch with me
But right now you just touching me
And I'm touching you, damn
Oh, get some white like glue
Get you some dope like Coke
But you like that Pepsi
I can mount and do you
Girl I wanna screw you like some Texas Tea
Oh, damn, I'm with your girl can't you see?
But I'm just trying to get with your other girl that has another girl
That I'm trying to get with, damn I know all these bitches want this dick
Don't fall in love with me
After we're done, don't want to be in touch with me

Told you not to fall in love with me, don't
Cause when we're done, she ain't gonna be in love with me, no
I'm a bad guy but I always got bad bitches, oh
Yeah, I'm always taking bad bitches home
Man, I'm great, you just a clone
Don't, don't, tell the bitch don't fall in love with me
But your bitch obsessed with me, she's undressing me
Damn, I'm just flexing B
Flexing on that weed, cause I'm hella strong like that weed bitch
Got your bitch using my dick as a remote like a Wii, yeah
Don't fall in love with me
Don't, don't fall in love with me
Cause after we're done, don't want to be in touch with me
