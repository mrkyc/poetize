Ask me to be in the Dub Ep
Then turn around and sneak diss me
Two faced bitches making me watch my back man
Expected me not to detect that shit, I'm Batman
How you talking shit when your name rhymes with wack man
You need to rehire Ben for your ghost writing
You a god, well I'm a titan
You out of time,  I'm chronos
Enough of that, me and Khromos
Pushing that move music
Thats that make the girls move music
Thats that make the homies move to it
Hol up, hol up, roll up in the fruit roll up, shit candy red
Frosted chain, diabetic coma shit had me dead
Got you girl sipping cola, coca cola
Exhausted dame, hol her breath when she give me head
Oh, goddamn she all up in my bed
Oh shit, swerve with that bitch when I'm done with it
I don't give a fuck, boy do what I want
Hol up, hol up, roll up in the fruit roll up
Oh, goddamn see your bitch and we roll up
On that dopest dope, man on on that dopest dope
When she hear my shit, know that it's the dopest dope
You might also like
Fuck your bitch on the couch then I open up her mouth
After I spread her legs, goddamn oh man what the fuck is this
Gucci FlipFlops and I'm back up in this

Same shit I flip with
Wait, I ain't talking bout flipping bricks
