When I pull up on a bitch I tell that bitch "blow blow"
I'm whipping out my dick and told that bitch to open up her loud mouth
Make her shout loud, make her shout loud...

Cause if I fuck then she's a legend, oh my god, oh my God
If I fuck then she's a legend, oh my God, oh my God
In her ass, in her pussy, got it in her mouth
Got a girl, I put it in her South
If I fuck then she's a legend, oh my God, oh my God
If I fuck then she's a legend, oh my God, oh my God
Got a Girl, put it in her South
Pull it out, stick it in her mouth
She don't know what's up
I'm just 'bout to cum
Oh my God, oh my God

Gucci's back, I'm loud and clear
Got a girl, she's proud and queer
Pour her a beer, I don't drink I just want that pink
Yeah I said, Gucci's back, loud and clear
I Got your girl, say proud and queer
Bring em over here, I wanna shake that ass
Deh deh do the math, deh deh meh
I ask her if she'll fuck
