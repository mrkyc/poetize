Every time they see, you act a little different
They be like every time we see, you act a little different
Look a little, look a little different

Oh man, man
Back up in this shit like I'm Chance
Got a bitch back up on my pants, goddamn
Broads up in Atlanta
Looking like I'm Panda, eating Panda Panda every night
Do this shit right, sip on ice, cup on ice
Baby girl come my way, won't you come my way, shit

Say you always miss the old me
But 2 years ago, you ain't even fucking know me
So what's the old me, the fuck that's supposed to mean
Girl how come every time I see you, you be acting a little different
Is it because the last time I saw you, I fucking swerved you
Is it because the last time I saw you, I fucking hurt you
Well you want me on that old shit
So I'm on that fuck that bitch shit
Used to be on that tryna get rich shit
But you got me fucked up
Girl why you be so salty, got me acting so fucking frosty goddamn

You be saying we a match, but you get no love
Yeah, I just finish nutting then go on like it's nothing
Yeah, cover up the taco with some dressing like it's ranch
I'm from the south but I've never been to a ranch
Goddamn, yeah and I'm chilling on the weekend
Listening to The Weeknd, bitches got me going off the deep end
Used to be a nice guy, now I'm fucking scumbag
Girl her washing in the shower, yeah I used her as a cumrag
Used to be a church girl, now she done turned bad
Girl, once you ride me, know you can't turn back
Smoke the fucking blunts till my lips fucking turn black
Goddamn, and you know you fucking love that
Goddamn, Gucci fucking back, yeah Gucci, Gucci's back, oh man
Oh girl, pop that coochie back for me, mhm
That pussy bomb, that's some triple x
Ignore the text from my tripping ex
Back to the party like whose stripping next
Yeah, I ain't from the 6 but I'm triple six
I ain't fucked your bitch, she just slipped  on dick
Always up so I'm not the one she's sleeping with

They be like every time we see you, you act a little different
They be like every time we see you, you look a little different
