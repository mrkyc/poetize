This right here is my jam
Got a bitch with a fat ass damn
Look at me, as I turned this into a jam

Smoking on potent looking just like Makonnen
In the club on a tuesday, true say
Smoking on a Scooby Dooby
Do your bitch wanna go to the movies
Actually do your bitch wanna make a movie
Man that shit groovy
I can do this all day, all day
Man I ain't even gotta play man
Look at that play man
Like I'm Marino look at that play man
This right here I'm about to kill
Cause you know I'm about to kill
And I know, and I know, and I know, I'm true
And you know, and you know, and you know, it's true

I'm a playboy like my name was Hugh
Motherfucker I never up in the school
Because nah that was never my cue
But I'm always feeling like I'm extra cool
Like I'm ice, damn I'm so nice
Looking like, looking like fight like Mike
Looking like Fight Night
All theses shots getting taken, all these hooks that I'm killing
Man I know you get that feeling when I'm up on that pillar
Man I'm high as the ceiling, man I'm high I can't feel it
Man I'm high I can't feel it, man I'm high I'm just chilling
Man I'm high, oh man, man I'm high
Look at my voice crack, man I'm... you would've thought I was on crack
But I'm not on that, man you know that's true
Man you know I'm only on that Scooby Dooby Doo
And you know I'm only on that Scooby Dooby Doo
And if you ain't like me then screw you too
