What is life when no one knows you
Not even your mother and father?
Not your friends in the YouChew scene
And you're mean when they wanna go farther?
Too many secrets, not enough mysteries
Obnoxious like killer bees
Not like Wu-Tang, I'm a pain in the ass
Cause I stay in class and I have a lot of sass
"Hey man, what's with this emo shit?
It's a party, go hard, even just a little bit"
I'm like Pitbull, cause I'll bite your face off
And woo your bitch just enough for a jackoff
No one cares if your lyrics are good
If your sound's trash, then Donger doesn't get wood
Upchuck, just to lose weight
"Don't girls do that?" Cracka, why the hate?
In my late teens, hate means they're not worthy
You wish ill on them, hope they die of scurvy
Stupid freshmen have a personality switch
This like a feature from Pac cause I fucked your bitch
(This is a conscious rap album, right? Oh, okay)

Preach, preach
The Lord says I must preach
Preach, preach
What do you want me to teach?

Somebody lied, I'm a star like Ringo
Gave your girl my number, now she gonna call like "Bingo!"
Now we swappin' tongues like we swappin' lingo
Yeah, only she knows what that means, yo
Yeah, keep the heater on my side, El Nino
El nina, la nina, la bonitas always on my side, always on my side
Uh, don't let me turn it into a homicide, homi-
Now, I'm just playin', this supposed to be a peaceful track
Talkin' about me fucking your bitch from the back
Young Gucci, preach


Take a vacation in Miami
I'm so fucked up that you can't even understand me
I'm stutterin', I'm slurrin', my vision's blurrin'
Damn, girl, oh, I need you right now
Come through, preach
I need you to come through, girl, so I can fuck you
Girl, that's a can-do, girl, that's a can-do, girl
Preach
Oh, girl
My vision is blurrin'
I don't understand what I'm sayin', my speech is slurrin'
I need some help right now, girl
Oh, preach, preach
I can't do this by myself, girl
Oh, preach, preach
Need some help right now, oh
Cause I can't do this by myself right now
