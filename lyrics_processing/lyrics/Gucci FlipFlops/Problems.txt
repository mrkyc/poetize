Hol up, its the White Pretty Flacko
White girls in my crib like a cocaine castle
Throwing 8s out like Matt Hassel
Only want 9s and aboves, fuck em on the rug
Let her rub and tug, suck and fuck
She so dirty, she like it raw
Slide in like socks in halls
Last name Stockton way she handles balls
Yeah, Gucci on the beat man
Killing it, killing it, I'm killing it like some beef man
Every beef I'm in I'm killing it
I smash it like so beef man, whoa that's kinda weird but I don't give a fuck
I'm just having fun out here
Gucci killing this shit again, every time
And you know it's true, and you know it's true
Every time I get on a beat ... you know it's true
Uh, you already know I ain't got no fucking problems
And even if I did, then you know the bank'll solve it
Look at all this, I got more pounds than a fat kid
Matter of fact, I get more meals than a fat kid
Fact is, I want it like it's not got already, so I come through
Your top's shot off, shit is messy, I come through
My soft top's off, car's cramberry, got hoes taking
Their tops off, it's hot, like I'm Nelly, the fact is
We hit the gas, sipping lean, higher than a hawk
Then we hit the gas, tire's screech, running from the cops
Damn, and you already know I walk it like I talk it
So if I say my dog's shot up your office, then don't doubt it
I go about it, like I have no housing
Like I don't make four thousand, by the hourly
Damn, and I'm about to go home with a freak
So excuse my French, but il est tard, allons y

Yeah hoe, this the finale
Like Kenny said, turning shit up like a pep rally
Backyard looking like a farm with all the girls I rally
Xs strutting past me cause I'm tryna get up in that belly
Addyed up, bitch y'all can't reach me
Slumped off that purple and that potent weed
Didn't know K got bars like penitentiaries
I pull up to the spot and took a shot like I'm at puck's
Do i really look like a nigga who gives a fuck?
Cause i thought it was evident from the girls I fuck
Thought it was evident from all the fuckin; drugs took
Thought it was evident from all the fuckin' domes I shook
They say money make a nigga prince
But at least my nigga nigga rich
I be fuckin' your bitch in some flipflops at the mall
