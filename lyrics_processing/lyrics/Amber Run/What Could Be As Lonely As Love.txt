I'm so afraid of saying something wrong
There's a real danger in saying nothing at all
That I'll go back to the rabbit and drink, yeah
Half-cut, fired up, say what I think
That you're funny, interesting, too
That the air warms up when you walk in the room
That I still dream about the night we met
How I don't mean it now as I meant it then

What could be as lonely as love?
What could ever hurt this much?
What if you're the only one?

So let me in, let me in from out of the cold
I'm okay, I'm doing fine -- the greatest lie ever told
Even I don't recognize reflections of mine
When I'm the next call down the emergency line, I'll say

What could be as lonely as love?
What could ever hurt this much?
What if you're the only one?
What could be as lonely as love?
