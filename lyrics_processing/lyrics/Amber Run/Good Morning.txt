Oh, you can feel like a light in the dark
Oh, like the wheel, it's discovered by chance
And you know that you should, and you could, but you wouldn't
You make me feel like a child
And you break, and cry, but you carry on
You know the world seems wild

But if you run like a child and act like a child
Honestly, what's there to worry about?
And if you run like a child and act like a child
Honestly, what's there to worry about?

And oh, you can feel like a fish out of water
And oh, like the world's come to rest on your shoulders
And you know that you should, and you could, but you wouldn't
Let everything fall
You know these lonely games that you're playing?
You know they're not games at all

But if you run like a child and act like a child
Honestly, what's there to worry about?
And if you run like a child and act like a child
Honestly, what's there to worry about?
