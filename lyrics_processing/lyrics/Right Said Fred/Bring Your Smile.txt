Bring your lips
Bring those sweet words I can sip
Bring your heart
Bring your beat
That always brings me to my feet
'Cause you must know
That I won't go anywhere unless I know
If gotta bring your laugh
Bring your vibe
That little something deep inside
Bring it on yeah bring it on
You've made me wait babe far too long
'Cause you must know
That I won't go anywhere unless I know
Ah ah ah
You gotta bring your smile
Bring your smile to me
Ah ah ah
You gotta bring your smile
Bring your smile to me
Sing your song
That sweet refrain
It always wins me round again
Bring your moon
Bring your stars
Bring the night that's always ours
