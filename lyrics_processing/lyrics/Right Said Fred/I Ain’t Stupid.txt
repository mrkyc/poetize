Way back baby they lost the plot
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
From my quiver
An arrow for my bow
Pull it really hard
Let it really go
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
King of kiss he done nothing for me yet
Kisses his cross and genuflects
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
The lord of love in his old cold castle
Moats bone dry, silly old rascal
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
A slip of the tongue, she's so soothing
I could be arrested for the way I'm moving
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
A flick of the wrist, slowly blinking
You might also likeI could be arrested for the way I'm thinking(chorus???)
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
Come on, come on
Hammer nails in wood
Brick by brick we can make it real good
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
Come on, come on
Give me love
Give me trust
Believe it or not
I love the serious stuff
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
A slip of the tongue, she's so soothing
I could be arrested for the way I'm moving
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
A flick of the wrist, slowly blinking
I could be arrested for the way I'm thinking(chorus???)
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
Cos I could
I did what I did
Take it to the girl
Take it to the bridge
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
Because I could
I hit where I hit
Straight to the heart
Between the lips
I ain't stupid
Relying on cupid now
A slip of the tongue, she's so soothing
I could be arrested for the way I'm moving
Lipstick on, she puts her lipstick on
A flick of the wrist, slowly blinking
I could be arrested for the way I'm thinking
