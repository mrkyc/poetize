Who says white people have no rhythm?
Clean your teeth with your feet
Hug a bus or two
Take a sprout for a walk
Make a sand igloo
And if they fail to see you
Stick it out so they can feel you
You gotta laugh
Yeah
If you stick it out
Stick it out, ya gotta stick it out

Stick it out, ya gotta stick it out

He's too hasty
Now, you never get nowhere if you're too hasty
