Tell me what's wrong with this picture
We should be all fun and games
Lighting the sky with fireworks
I know how you love a display
Tell me what's wrong with this picture
No sign of thunder or rain
No butterflies or tidal waves
It's kinda heart for me to explain
We've been through this thing before
It's not the way
You open up my letters
It's not the way
I never make you breakfeast
It's not the way
We gave up on pleasure
It's not the way
It's not the way
It's not the way
It's not the way

Tell me what's wrong with this picture
Nocturnal capers are rare
The earth hasn't moved since New Year's Eve
Summer's gone with nothing to spare
We've been through this thing before
It's not the way
You open up my letters
It's not the way
I never make you breakfeast

Tell me what's wrong with this picture
The model the painter the frame
No it's just us lazy in love
Don't make me say it again
We've been through this thing before
It's not the way
You open up my letters
It's not the way
I never make you breakfeast
It's not the way
