I was built to be the best
Number one and nothing less
Leave me to my destiny
I have waited patiently
I have vision, oh, I believe
I know I can count on me

So, stand up, for the champions
For the champions, stand up
Stand up, stand up
For the champions, for the champions

Stand up (Stand up), for the champions
For the champions, stand up
Stand up (Stand up), stand up (Stand up)
For the champions, for the champions, stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up

Here we go, it's getting close
Now it's just who wants it most
It's just life, that's how it is
'Cause we have our strengths and weaknesses
Oh, I have vision, can't you see?
I'm on the move, make way for me

And when I fall down, I have to pick myself back up
And when I fall down, I have to pick myself back up (Stand up, stand up)
And when I fall down (For the champions, for the champions), I have to pick myself back up (Stand up, stand up)
