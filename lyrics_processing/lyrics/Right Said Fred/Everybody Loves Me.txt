I'm a pop star
Hip hip hooray
No clouds in my sky
Premieres and stocks and shares
Paradise on ice
So much fun
I'm the chosen one
Hip hip hooray
I got a gold disc
Hip hip hooray
I'm honored and I'm thrilled
No one ever mentioned that I'm pickin' up the bill
C'est la vie
The drinks are on me
Everybody loves me money
Just like on TV
Everybody says they really care
Everybody loves me money
Just you wait and see
So much fun
I'm the chosen one
Hip hip hooray
I've got diamonds
Hip hip hooray
I've got houses, boats and cars
Life is getting tougher for us daring superstars
That charity, it depends on me

I'm on the dole now
Not hip today
My rent is overdue
Scavengers and managers still waiting to be fed
The girls don't cling
And the phone don't ring
No it don't, no it don't
Everybody, everybody, everybody loves me
Everybody loves me money
