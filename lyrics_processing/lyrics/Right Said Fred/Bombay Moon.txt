Hanging over Bombay
And when I see it, it reminds me of you
There's a moon like a smile
Hanging over Bombay
When I see it, oh it reminds me of you
God knows you've been away so long
I got a call from Cuba
And a postcard from Hong Kong
Blue eyes, blue eyes, they used to be mine
Now there's some guy in a bar
With blue eyes on his mind
'Cause every time I see your face begin to fade
Then the night brings it back again
There's a moon like a smile
Hanging over Bombay
When I see it, it reminds me of you
There's a moon like a smile
Hanging over Bombay
When I see it (when I see it)
It reminds me of you
Who said that absence makes love strong?
I got a nagging doubt
Who said that could be wrong
'Cause every time I hear
Your footsteps slowly fade
Then the night brings them back again
