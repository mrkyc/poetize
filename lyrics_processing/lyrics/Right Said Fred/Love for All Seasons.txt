That's all I want to say
There's no room for manoevre
Make sure that it stays
A love for all seasons
October was a drag
Damn it all
You and I were fools
Overcast and sad
Winter blues
Allowing us to cool
When it's grey I know all I want to do
Resort to make-believe
There's no truth in the rumour
That's all I want to say
There's no room for manoevre
Make sure that it stays
A love for all seasons
January comes
Steely blue
Nothing seems to rhyme
With all the noise of spring
Passion wakes
Cos' we hear summertime
You might also likeWhen it's grey I know all I want to do

That's all I want to say
There's no room for manoevre
So Make sure that it stays
A love for all seasons...
October comes around
As it does
But this time we're prepared
You and I can go
To love land
There's a sunset to be shared
When it's grey I know all I want to do
Resort to make-believe...
There's no truth in the rumour
That's all I want to say
There's no room for manoevre
So Make sure that it stays
There's no truth in the rumour

Pull it off the wall
All the curtains, girl
