Heaven's got the moon and stars
Funny how they always are
Shining down from high above
Never giving up on love

I just can't imagine
Can you? (Can you?)
A world with little laughter
How blue
But unless you can rely
Take a look up to the sky

Heaven's got the moon and stars
Funny how they always are
Shining down from high above
Never giving up on love

High up on a mountain
Somewhere
Oh, way out in the middle
Of nowhere
You can set your sail to see
Maybe we can all agree

Another day has come up
And gone
Nightingales have played us
Their song
For we know the sun gives way
As the night begins to play

Heaven's got the moon and stars
Funny how they always are
Shining down from high above
Never giving up on love
Heaven's got the moon and stars
(Heaven's got the moon and stars)
Funny how they always are
(Funny how they always are)
Shining down from high above
(Shining down from high above)
Never giving up on love
(Never giving up on love)
Heaven's got the moon and stars
(Heaven's got the moon and stars)
Funny how they always are
(Funny how they always are)
Shining down from high above
(Shining down from high above)
Never giving up on love
(Never giving up on love)
Heaven's got the moon and stars
(Heaven's got the moon and stars)
Funny how they always are
(Funny how they always are)
Shining down from high above
(Shining down from high above)
Never giving up on love
(Never giving up on love)
