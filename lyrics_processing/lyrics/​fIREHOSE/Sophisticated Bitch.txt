Just leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold
Knowin' for a fact that girl is whacked
If you hold your hand out she'll turn her back
Better walk don't talk she's all pretend
Can't be her friend unless you spend
Wall to wall after all
Get ready to throw only money at the bitch
Cause she thinks she's so'phisticated
Peekin', seekin' inside a book
Her demands for a man with a chemical look
Wishes, desires, gettin worse with age
She doesn't want a man, all she wants is a page
Ain't got a man so she goes to a club
She think it's classy but it's really a pub
But that's the kind of place she likes to go
The bitch got a problem
Cause she thinks she's so'phisticated
Jackets, shoes, everyday ties
The girl only wants one of those guys
Suckers who front like it ain't no thing
Pretend to be friends, don't want that thang
Talk like this, don't talk slang
Do anything to get that thang
Tries to be chic and play it off
Peekin' through the window, I saw her take her clothes off
Nasty girl, stone cold freak
Stayin' in bed a whole goddamn week
Comin' and leavin' guys servin' up storms
From execs with checks, boys from the dorms
Never kept a name, never seen a face
She could pass 'em in the street like it never took place
I know she's a ho I'm on the go
Expose the funky bitch
You might also likeCause she thinks she's so'phisticated
Now she wants a sucker but with an attache
And if you ain't got it, she'll turn you away
You can smile with stile but you lost your trial
Cause you got a gold tooth, she thinks you're wild
She don't want a brother that's true and black
If you're light, you're alright, better stay back
Cause the sucker with the bag is out the catch
With something in his bag keepin' her attached
The man's got a plan, it's IBM
The devil at her level, yes it's him
His Audi she rides, his gold and clothes
The ill base method, turning up her nose
Lack a lack a lack, now beaming her up
She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up
Her status looks at us from down below
Now the bitch is in trouble
Cause she was so'phisticated
Little is known about her past
So listen to me cause I know her ass
Used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes
And never got caught, so the story goes
She kept doin' that to all her men
Found the wrong man when she did it again
And still to this day people wonder why
He didn't beat the bitch down till she almost died
