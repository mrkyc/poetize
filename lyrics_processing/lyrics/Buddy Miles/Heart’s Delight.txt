I went down to my baby's house Just the other night
She was lookin' pretty good She looked out of sight
I held her hand she frowned at me
She said come on baby let's go down to the sea
Then I knew things were right as time went on
Our love grew before the dawn
And I knew by the smile upon her face
That I showed somehow ah a saving grace
Yeah just to see the smile on her face
Well
We went to a party just the other night
Everybody there said she looked out of sight
Cause I had troubles before with another girl
And now it seems like I'm in a brand new world
And I saw by her face she could give me a way
She could thank me thank me thank me...
Thank me for a brand new day. Yeah
And she's my heart delight oh my baby so out of sight
Oh and she's knows by the time I come home home
Yeah
She's alright
She's my heart delight
Yeah Yeah

I went to her house just the other night
My baby was lookin' good she looked out of sight
She was gettin' ready to leave she was goin' away
And she didn't have a word no she didn't have much to say
And she felt somehow that I mistreated her
And like a fool I went to her
And then I said for a while come and stay with me
