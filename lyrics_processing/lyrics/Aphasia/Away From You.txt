Its so hard to know that were worlds apart
And I was so wrong to think this would all be so easy
But trust me Ill be back for more
For then Ill close my eyes
And your past will be safe with me here
Forever
I dive into a world of fact and fiction
But I'm swimming in my own contradiction
In my fantasy you are here with me
You can say its alright
You can say you don't mind
Its killing me to be away from you
So you can say its alright
And you can say you don't mind
Its killing me to be away from
Your side
I'm done with hellos and goodbyes
I'm falling apart inside
I try to make you speak
But your beautiful, awkward silence falls on me
But trust me Ill be back for more
For then Ill close my eyes
And your past will be safe with me here
Forever
You might also likeI dive into a world of fact and fiction
But I'm swimming in my own contradiction
In my fantasy you are here with me
And it makes my nights a little richer
I'm falling in love with a faded picture of you, my fantasy
You are here with me
You can say its alright
You can say you don't mind
Its killing me to be away from you
So you can say its alright
And you can say you don't mind
Its killing me to be away from...
You are the burning in my throat
A gentle wisp of smoke
That ever quickly floats past my face
Then you're gone, and I wish it wasn't true
You can say its alright
You can say you don't mind
Its killing me to be away from you
So you can say its alright
And you can say you don't mind
