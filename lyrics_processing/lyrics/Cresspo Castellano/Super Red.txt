Bad to the bone yeah I'm bad in the mental
I'm bad to the core my homie yeah I bring the fundamentals
Of real rap shit
Light a real bad spliff
Then I turn around and walk away
Now homie take a sit
As I grapple through your mind
Let me piece right through the puzzles
I put it all together yeah I'm crazy but I'm subtle
I'm a big booty hitter
A black label drinker
An open minded thinker
And a titty game tickler
Ill open up your vortex let me dig into your fantasy
Treat you like a queen when we alone we gets nasty
White thunder level my high is on a treble
Intouch with higher powers and my eyes is like the devil
And low as an asian I'm african the jungle
Where pyramids they lay we got the earth right by the knuckles
Take your stekkie gully
What you wanna dulla cuzzy
Wanna tune a praaitjie
Then you vy pozi bloody
