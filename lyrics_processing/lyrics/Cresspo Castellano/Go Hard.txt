In This Life It's Simple You Know
There's Two Things
Either You Winning Or You Not Evening Playing At All
It's Either You Go Hard Or You Go Home
Ain't Here To Chit Chat
I Just Wanna Tell You The Real
It's Either You Go Hard Or You Go Home
Your Call

I Go Hard For My Hustle Everyday I Wouldn't Lie
Keep My Money On My Mind And My Mind Up In The Sky
Ain't Got Time For Nobody Who Ain't Got Time For Me And Mine
And I Rock For Hip Hop Until The Very Day I Die
I Go Hard All The Time " I Go Hard All The Time"
I Go Hard All The Time " Now I Go Hard All The Time"
See I Go Hard All The Time " I Go Hard All The Time"
Now I Go Hard All The Time" Say I Go Hard All The Time"

I Go Hard For My City I Go Hard For My Grind
They Can See It In My Hood My Hood Is Never Hard To Find
In The Booth And In The Streets I Keep My Hustle On My Mind
And I Could Never Leave A Man Behind "Never"
Call Me Bantu Site
Where Upon The Beats I'm A Killer
Spit Lines With Flames When I Rhyme Call Me Godzilla
When I Put The Bang In The Mike Like D Your Father
Lines So Fresh And So Delicious You Mistake Em For A Father
Tonight Am Writing Raps On Your Father
I'm Killing You Wanna Be Tupacs With Your Bandana
And Every Time I Drop A Line I Know Blow A Fucking Minds Out
You Ain't Never In My League
Grab Your Star For A Scout
Ain't The Type To Backdown
When I Should Put My Fist High
Ain't Never Gonna Fall Ain't Never Gonna Die
Ama Always Say The Truth And I Never Gonna Lie
Ain't Never Going Soft And I Don't Need To Tell You Why
