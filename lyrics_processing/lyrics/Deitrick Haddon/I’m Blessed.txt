I'm out for blood
You messed with the wrong one
At the wrong time, you messed with me and my family
First Verse
You were a fool to underestimate me
I've got angels standing right beside me
I can start a war with just one command
You don't know just who I am
I am the one that gonna break your back and make you
Remember that you ain't all that
And devil you know what I was born to do assassinate
You and your demons too
Chorus-
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
And you can't curse what the Lord has blessed
Your voodoo won't work cause I'm so blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
And you can't curse what the Lord has blessed
Your spell won't work cause I'm so blessed
Second Verse
You did it this time, I'm out for blood
You Jezebel try to wreck my life like the prophet
Elijah
But it didn't work it just took me higher
You ain't nothing but a boldface liar
I'm going to be there when god toss you in the fire
And I bind you in the name of the lord
We the people of god ain't afraid no more
I've got the word in my hand just like Anais
I'm going to cut everything that's anti-Christ
You might also likeChorus
Imma show no mercy
Third Verse
The anointing is my deity and I'm about to detonate
You knew god's hand was upon my life
You refused to cooperate
You messed with me you mess with the Father
I'm I'm just getting hotter
Walking in power look at your face you looking all sour
It's making you sick,, you pulling out your spells
And tricks
You had to come through my angels first
And now your curse has been reversed
And I'm suiting up
Getting ready for war
I'm not taking no more
I'm not like the rest
Cause I'm so blessed
