L.X.W. step on ya
It's Deitrick Haddon man (mmmmm)
Church rock
Y'all know me D Haddy
This swag, get it from my daddy
Wear my clothes fitted, don't sag
Walk around with my own theme music in my bag
Got a new dance, original
It's taking over, leggo
Got it from the saints, marching in
Took it to the hood, and broke it in
Put your hands in the hair, give God praise
Then take a minute, do it your way
Tell the DJ, don't stop
When you hear the beat drop, church rock
You can do it
I know you can do it
All around the world, when you hear the beat drop
Stop, and let me see you church rock
Move (church rock)
Let me see ya (let me see you church rock)
Move (church rock)
You can do it (you can do the church rock)
Move (church rock)
Let me see ya (let me see you church rock)
Move (church rock)
Don't stop 'til you learn the church rock
America I like the way you do it their way
UK they keep it church rocking all day
I want my people in Paris, to dance
Konnichiwa I can't forget the saints in Japan
I got the whole world dancing to the beat of one drum
Look at what dee dee done dee dee dee done done
We got our own way, we giving our praise
If you don't want to dance, move out of our way
Man gone tell me you lost our soul, lost your dance
You need it up, Holy Ghost fire
Take the beat up, higher
You can do it
You can do it
All around the world, when you hear the beat drop
Stop, and let me see you church rock
Dance (church rock)
Oooo (let me see you church rock)
Yea (church rock)
Don't stop 'til you learn the church rock
We ain't pop lockin'
We ain't booty droppin'
We church rockin' we ain't never stoppin'
Follow my lead as we proceed
Get a place partner and do it like me
Wave the usher down
Wave your usher down
Let me get by
Let me get by
Turn to your neighbor, stop
Put your praying hands up, do the church rock
Rock it to the front, rock to the back
Rock it, rock it, rock it like that
Put your shoulders in it, dip with it
Do the church rockin', you can get it
You can do it
I know you can do it
All around the world, when you hear the beat drop
Stop, and let me see you church rock
West coast (church rock)
East coast (let me do the church rock)
