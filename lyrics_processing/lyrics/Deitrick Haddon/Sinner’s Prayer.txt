I could have been dead sleeping in my grave
But god blessed me to see another day
Even when I did wrong he was still there
I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer
I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer

I walked in the church lord on a sunday morning
Stood out side contemplating wether I should walk through the door
Ya see, a lot of folks knew me from way back when
People holding me to all those past sins
But I know all have sinned and come short of his glory
I'm just glad I'm still here to tell the story

I could have been dead sleeping in my grave
But god blessed me to see another day
Even when I did wrong he was still there
I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer
I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer

Ye that's without sin, won't you cast the first stone
Cus ain't nobody perfect but the man sitting on the throne
But it's about time for us to stop judging one another
Stop acting holier than thou and start lifting up your brother
But I know all have sinned and come short of it's glory
I'm just glad i'm still here to tell the story

I could have been dead sleeping in my grave
But god blessed me to see another day
Even when I did wrong he was still there
I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer
I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer

Now let me pray let me pray
Our father which art in heaven hollowed would be thy name
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us deliver us from evil
Hey hey hey hey hey he
For thine is the kingdom and the powere and the glory forever
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
