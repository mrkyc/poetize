Get up!
On your feet now
Dance wit me, praise wit me

Now it's about time for me to testify
Ima change my wrong to right
And if it wasn't for the lord workin in my life, I could never survive
Now with eveybody in got a right to praise, you kno its got to be me
Now move, back it up give me some space, cause i'm about to raise up in this place
{Chorus}
I can feel him all in my hands
Feel him all in my feet
