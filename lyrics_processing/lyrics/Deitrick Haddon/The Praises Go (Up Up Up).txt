No one's telling me how to act my friend
You can praise him right where you stand
It's time to break out in to a dance now
Everybody just stomp your feet
And magnify the Lord with me
All together at the count of 3 (1, 2, 3...)
When the praises go up up up (com'on now)
The blessings come down down down
When the praises go up up up
The blessings come down down down
He said he would open up the windows of heaven
And pour the amount of the blessings you will have room to receive
When the praises go
When the praises go
Don't just stand there make some noise
If you praise him you can feel his joy
His presence you can not avoid
Every woman bad girl and boy now
This is the day to cry aloud
Your break through is right here right now
If you don't know what to do let me show you how
When the praises go up up up (com'on now)
The blessings come down down down
When the praises go up up up
The blessings come down down down
He said he would open up the windows of heaven
And pour the amount of the blessings you will have room to receive
When the praises go
When the praises go
What I want you to do is get your praise partner
Every body send the praise up
Every body send the praise up
And the blessings they will come down
And your blessings...
Every body send the praise up
Every body send the praise up
And the blessings they will come down
And your blessings...
Every body send the praise up
Every body send the praise up
And the blessings they will come down
And your blessings...
Every body send the praise up
Every body send the praise up
And the blessings they will come down
