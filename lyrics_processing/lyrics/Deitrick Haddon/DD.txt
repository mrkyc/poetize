When you see hear me on the radio
(Deitrick Haddon)
When you see me on TV
(Deitrick Haddon)
On the cover of my CD, y'all
(Deitrick haddon)
But when I'm at home, I'm just D.D
That is what they call me, D.D
My wife need to call me, baby
Let me be real, let me be me
I'm just a normal guy from da hood
Tryin' to get my point across, be understood
I would never stop singin', if I could
'Cuz the God I serve has been too good
I just wanna keep it, keep it real
'Cause I can't tell you nothin', I dont feel
Take this journey with me, for a while
We gon' laugh, we gon' cry, we gon' smile
Everybody call me, yeah

And only all my brothers and sisters say
(d.d)
And those who know me back in the day
( d.d)
My Grandmother called me her baby
(d.d)
And I'm just a real one, let me be me
(d.d)
I was just a little boy, had a dream
That I would sing in the presence of Kings
And spread the love of Jesus Christ
And watch His power change peoples lives
And now that I'm older, nothing's changed
My goal is pretty much the same
Had to go through some heartaches and pain
But now, I'm doin' it in Jesus' name
Everybody call me, y'all
(Deitrick Haddon)
And when I'm in a concert, y'all
(Deitrick Haddon)

At the end of the chain
I'll always be, D.D
And my family and friends call me, D.D
My Mama still think I'm a baby
And I'm a real one, I want you to see
The only way I know how to be is myself
I don't try to be like somebody else
God created all of us to be one of a kind
I can't take what's yours and you can't take what's mine
Now, through the storm, I will be
(Deitrick Haddon)
Through the rain, I will be
(Deitrick Haddon)
And through the sickness, I will be
(Deitrick Haddon)
And through the pain, I will be
(Deitrick Haddon)
And you can't change me
(d.d)
'Cuz I'm just plain old
(d.d)
My wife don't need to call me
(d.d)
I'ma real, what I want you to see
Everybody call me
(d.d)
And you can't make me be in
(d.d)
That's all I give y'all
(Deitrick Haddon)
I'm just a humble guy
(d.d)
Got the love of Jesus in my life
(d.d)
I'm still
(d.d)
And I'm the real one, I want you to see, oh
