When I Make A Decision, God Can So
Transform Me With His Truth, That No Matter If
I Look To The Right, Left, Behind Me, In Front
Of Me; How Destructive Everything Looks, If I
Stay Still And Hear The Salvation Of The Lord
God Is On My Side, I'm Making A Decision By
The Blood Of Jesus
See What The Lord Has Done For Us, See What
A Mighty God He Is.
