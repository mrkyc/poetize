Oh, Lord Almighty
For my soul longs
And even faints for You
For here my soul is satisfied
Within Your presence
I sing beneath
The shadow of Your wings

Better is one day in Your house

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

One thing I ask and I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in
The place Your glory dwells
