Think it's time to admit a few things
I've been feeling some way
About the cynical man I've become
Love can be such a difficult thing
And the pain that it brings
Can be confusing and leave you undone

And I'm here, but I'm gone
Just a space where I was
So I think that I'm done
But you should know that you did nothing wrong

You maybe wondering why I seem cold
I'm just being selfish, yeah, I'm on hold
I need to be cruel to be kind
And tell you what's on my mind
I need to be selfish
I, I need to be selfish
I need to be selfish

So, tell me please that this all makes sense?
Say that somehow this puts your mind at rest
'Cause this isn't me, who I wanna be
I'd never act so indifferently
But I can't even say that I'm sorry
You might also like
That I'm here, but I'm gone
Just a space where I was
So I think that I'm done
But you should know that you did nothing wrong

You maybe wondering why I seem cold
I'm just being selfish, yeah, I'm on hold
I need to be cruel to be kind
And tell you what's on my mind
I need to be selfish

And it might be more than a minute that I need to take
It would be wrong for me to ask you to sit and wait
That would be selfish
No it's not like I'm calling this off for anybody else
No other reason, I just need a moment to myself
I need to be cruel to be kind
I need to be cruel to be kind

You maybe wondering why I seem cold
I'm just being selfish, yeah, I'm on hold
I need to be cruel to be kind
And tell you what's on my mind
I need to be selfish
