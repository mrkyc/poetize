I couldn't bare to see you moving on
Cause nobody else can have you
You told me what I gave was not enough
And the dumbing down of love has made you numb
You say that you dont feel anything at all
Well now youre gonna feel it in your heart
Like a bullet in your chest
I thought itd be best
To lay us to rest
And now a smoking gun
Is all that stands between us
I tried to make, you understand
Now theres blood, on my hands
Now Im on the run
And my demons won't release me
I couldn't be, a fool for love
I had to go, and end it all
With a smoking gun
Now a kiss it never made you think straight
And a bullet carries so much more weight
And if were gonna be over, youre gonna be over
Ill plead insanity, a jealous mans reprise
Before they come and take me, make pay for all my sins
Yeah youre gonna feel me in your heart
Like a bullet in your chest
So I thought itd be best
To lay us to rest
And now a smoking gun
Is all that stands between us
I tried to make, you understand
Now theres blood, on my hands
Now Im on the run
And my demons won't release me
I couldn't be, a fool for love
I had to go, and end it all
With a smoking gun
Youre gonna feel me in your heart
Like a bullet in your chest
So I thought itd be best
To lay us to rest
And now a smoking gun
Is all that stands between us
I tried to make, you understand
Now theres blood, on my hands
Now Im on the run
And my demons won't release me
I couldn't be, a fool for love
I had to go, and end it all
With a smoking gun
If its gonna be over, then youre gonna be over
If its gonna be over, then youre gonna be over
