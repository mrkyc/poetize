Had your heart broken
You lost it all
Now you're afraid to climb down from the shelf
'Cause you're scared you'll fall again
How long can you live that way?
You're holding back, it's driving me away

It's fair to say some give and take is what we need
We both have stress in our lives and I'm dealing with mine
Well I'm trying, so don't take it out on me

'Cause you're not the only one, the only one
The only one with shh... on your mind
The street runs both ways, we've all had those days
And if you don't see my side, then I don't feel to try
'Cause you're not the only one, the only one
The only one who struggles sometimes
You're so full of yourself, but you won't get no help
'Til you realise, you're not the only one

You make it hard, so hard, difficult to the end
Why should I break my back?
When you refuse to bend your rules
I wanna make one from two again
But it's just so hard to do it, yeah
When you're not playing fair
You might also like
So it's fair to say some give and take is what we need
We're all messed up in our ways, but I'm trying to change
Can you say the same?
Well don't take it out on me

'Cause you're not the only one, the only one
The only one with shh... on your mind
The street runs both ways, we've all had those days
And if you don't see my side, then I don't feel to try
'Cause you're not the only one, the only (one)
The only one who struggles sometimes
You're so full of yourself, but you won't get no help
'Til you realise, that you're not the only one

Oh no, so don't take it out on me
On me
The only one with shit on your mind
You're so full of yourself, but you won't get no help
