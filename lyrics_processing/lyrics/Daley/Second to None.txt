Everybody's out of line, telling me what I need
Well I'm not blind, I see fine
Yeah, I'm where I'm supposed to be
A million things I have to do
But this distraction's really all I need
'Cause can't nothing compare to my number one priority
And if this ain't what we're here for then tell me what is

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm foolish
A lifetime is a long time
So I might be crazy, but I don't put nothing before you
Without you to hold, this life don't mean nothing, no
And nothing comes close to being with you
'Cause you come second to none
Baby, second to none
[Verse 2
I'm sleeping too late, never on time
You give me bad habits but it's alright
I give you all my days, ooh, and nights
To make it all good I'd give you my life
'Cause I'm caught up in a feeling that I can't escape
Losing my focus getting carried away in thoughts of you
Now everybody else I gotta put on hold
You're the only one you know you run the show
Yeah you're the one that I choose and
If this ain't what we're here for then I don't wanna know
You might also like
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe, maybe I'm foolish
But a lifetime's a long, oh it's a long time
So I might be crazy, but I don't put nothing before you
Without you to hold, this life don't mean nothing, no
And nothing comes close to being with you
'Cause you come second to none

And I could have all the money in the world but
I might as well be dead broke
If I can't spend my time on you
'Cause there ain't nothing else I want
No, there ain't nothing worth all my intentions to you
I got a one-track mind you're the first in line, it's true

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm foolish
A lifetime is a long time
So I might be crazy, but I don't put nothing before you
Without you to hold, this life don't mean nothing, no
And nothing comes close to being with you
'Cause you come second to none
'Cause you come second to none
'Cause you come second to none
'Cause you come second to none
