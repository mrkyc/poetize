I waited for your call
You left me hanging on
It makes no sense at all
To me, no, no
We laid out all our pain
To a soundtrack that we made
But nothing resonates now
You're not here
And you're still ringing
In my ears

Melodies on memories on repeat
We're playing the feelings that we both pretending not to feel
With every note and every string
I remember everything
And so the melody lingers on

Now I need to drown out all of my pain
So I'm gonna listen to a song that reminds me of you
Of you
Of you, ooh oh
I'm tryna understand why my heart aches
So I'm listening to songs that remind me of you
Of you
Of you, ooh oh
You might also like
See, it's my therapy
I play the way I feel
I'm listening when I can't see you
I know you're thinking about me, too
So when it's "Killing You Softly"
Or Jill's saying, "Come See Me"
Well, you know where you should be
Our song is never over because

Melodies on memories on repeat
We're playing the feelings that we both pretending not to feel
With every note and every string
I remember everything
And so the melody lingers on

Now I need to drown out all of my pain
So I'm gonna listen to a song that reminds me of you
Of you
Of you, ooh oh
I'm tryna understand why my heart aches
So I'm listening to songs that remind me of you
Of you
Of you, ooh oh

So I'm playing Jill
Toni
Baby
Prince
John
Aaliyah
Lauren Hill
So I'm playing Jill
Toni
Baby
Prince
John
Aaliyah
Lauren Hill
And I know you're listening
I know you're listening
So the melody lingers

Now I need to drown out all of my pain
So I'm gonna listen to a song that reminds me of you
Of you
Of you, ooh oh
I'm tryna understand why my heart aches
So I'm listening to songs that remind me of you
Of you
