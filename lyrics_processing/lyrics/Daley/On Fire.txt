Taking about a thing you can't define
I'm so enamoured, with your mind, yeah
I really find it hard to keep away
Now it's too late to play it safe
You can't keep a moth away from a flame

'Cause I feel the heat the truth when I'm with you
Ends up being something more than just a game
I'm aware nobody does it like you do, is it only me?

You set me on fire, you set me on
You set me on fire, you turn me on
You set me on fire, you set me on
You set me on fire, fire

So let me burn
It makes no difference, I never learn
Now all the other flames I used to know
I couldn't keep them, they had to go
I had to tell them all to stop, drop and roll

'Cause I feel the heat, the truth when I'm with you
Ends up being something more than just a game
I'm aware nobody does it like you do
Is it only me, yeah?
You might also like
You set me on fire, you set me on
You set me on fire, you turn me on
You set me on fire, you set me on
You set me on fire, fire

So many summers passed tonight for you and I
Held in a daze our love emblazoned into time
Now it's begun, expand the sun, envelope me
You take me through, I burn for you
(You, you, you)
Oh I, I burn for you
(You, you, you)

Oh, you set me on fire, you set me on
You set me on fire, you turn me on
You set me on fire, you set me on
You set me on fire, fire

Set me on fire, set me on
Set me on fire, set me on
Set me on fire, set me on
Set me on fire, fire
Set me on fire, set me on
(Summers passed tonight for you and I)
Set me on fire, set me on
(In a daze our love emblazoned into time)
Set me on fire, set me on
(It's begun, expand the sun, envelope me)
Set me on fire, fire
