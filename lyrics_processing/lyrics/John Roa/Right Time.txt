I'm just gonna wait for Your right time, right time
Gotta have faith in Your right time, right time
I'm just gonna wait for Your right time, right time
Gotta have faith in Your right time, right time

Now, all I gotta do is just be patient
And walk this life with You and Your direction
'Cause Your plans are greater than my imagination
Don't gotta worry, I know that You got me
Now, all I gotta do is

Wait and have faith, my life is in Your hands, so I'm safe
And even before I was made, my future was already laid
So why would I be afraid with what tommorow would bring
Jeremiah 29:11, you already said it
Just gotta listed, believe in your vision
Ask for Your permission in every decision I make
Lead the way and I'll follow you Father
Only you know what's good and bad for me
So I'll find you in every moment and every thing I see

Oh, I don't need to rush it, no
I'll just put my trust in You
Oh, I don't need to rush it, no
I'll just put my trust in You

Walk by faith and not by sight
As long as I'm with You, I know I'll be alright
'Cause You have made everything, beautiful in its time
In perfect timing that's how you designed it
You're never too early, never too late
Never in a hurry this ain't a race
I'll follow your ways with all of my days
My future is safe because of Your grace
Like You said in your word
There's time for everything in this world
So Lord, I will wait and I will serve
