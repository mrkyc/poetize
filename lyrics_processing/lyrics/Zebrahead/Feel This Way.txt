I know that you care (and I know you care)
Man, I know that you care (and I know you care)

And I know you (and I know you care)

And I'll go where you want to go 'cause I feel this way
And I care what you got to say 'cause I feel this way (so I stepped up and I said I just don't understand)
And I'll go where you want to go 'cause I feel this way (He said just come and check it out man)

Here we go
Hip hop nation, vibe affiliation
All that I need is mind emancipation
Got to find a way to get away
Got to find something to make me want to stay
'Cause, all that I see is shaded
Now I can't even see straight cause I'm faded
Stressed cause of strain and you know that I'm leaving today (so)
And I care what you say, but I feel this way (this way)
And I'll go where you want to go, 'cause I feel this way (come check it out, man)
And I care what you gotta say, 'cause I feel this way (come check it out, man)
Yeah, I can, yeah, I'll go, 'cause I feel the way
