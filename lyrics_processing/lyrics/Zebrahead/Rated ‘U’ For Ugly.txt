Hit me, hit me, hit me with all you got
Just a superficial girl who cares a lot
About attentions that you get, they connect the dots
To form a target on your back, take your best shot
Who loves you? Who needs you?
The paint's peeling off the wall, that's it, that's all
Who loves you? Who needs you?
The itch makes your skin crawl, that's it, that's all
Head to the wall
Head to the wall

Life's staring you, breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to the end of your
Life starring you, breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to an end near you

Give me, give me, give me, got no heart to rot
When the scars and insecurities, they hit the spot
And the acceptance that you crave is all for not
Left a crosshair on your head, take your best shot
Who loves you? Who needs you?
Always waiting for a call, that's it, that's all
Who loves you? Who needs you?
Sets you up for a fall, that's it, that's all
Head to the wall
Head to the wall
You might also like
Life's staring you, breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to the end of your
Life starring you, breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to an end near you

So ugly with the lights on
Narcissistic girl
You're so ugly with the lights on
Narcissistic girl
You're so ugly with the lights on
Narcissistic girl
Living in her, "It's all about me world"

Life's staring you, breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to the end of your
Life starring you, breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to an end near you
