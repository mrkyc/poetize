I'm feeling lost
I'm feeling like my heart's been carved out with a spoon
Put on display, for all to witness this decay of me and you
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)

Awaking and taking the cycle of breaking up to a whole new level
Shaking and faking like you're making a hard choice not to settle
Imbedded, I'm think headed
I shredded all the letters you sent
Don't get it, why'd you let it get this far?
Now we reached the end
Lights out lights out, pass the herb
I turn lights out, lights out, kiss the curb
I turn lights out, lights, out your heart has turned
Who's going to save me every time I crash and burn?
And I crash and burn

I'm sick of endings
I'm done pretending
I just want you back to normal
I think you don't know just how you feel
And every time you think of me
Remember how things used to be not long ago?
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
You might also like
Ill fated, I skated, to the party faded, and I saw you there
I waited, hated, getting ignored you stated you didn't care
Flashes of car crashes and your ashes burning the cement
The curtain fails, last call, credits roll
We have reached the end
Lights out, lights out, pass the herb
I turn lights out, lights out, kiss the curb
I turn lights out, lights, out your heart has turned
Who's going to save you every time I crash and burn?
And I crash and burn (and crash and burn...)

I'm sick of endings
I'm done pretending
I just want you back to normal
I think you don't know just how you feel
And every time you think of me
Remember how things used to be not long ago?

Sick of endings
I'm done pretending
Tired of fighting
I'm sick of always trying
I'm feeling lost
I'm feeling like my heart's been carved out with a spoon
Put on display, for all to witness this decay of me and you

I just want you back to normal
I think you don't know just how you feel
And every time you think of me
Remember how things used to be not long ago?

(Whoa) Lights out, lights out, pass the herb
(Whoa) I turn lights out, lights out, kiss the curb
(Whoa) I turn the lights out, lights, out your heart has turned
(Whoa) Who's going to save me every time I crash and I burn?
And I crash and I burn
