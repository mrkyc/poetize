No way, (no way)
I think you need a new one
Hey, (hey), you, (you)

Hey, (hey), you, (you)
I know that you like me
No way, (no way)
You know it's not a secret
Hey, (hey), you, (you)
I want to be your girlfriend
You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel alright?
(alright, alright, alright)
Don't pretend, I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the motherfucking princess
I can tell you like me too, and you know I'm right
(I'm right, I'm right, I'm right)
She's, like "so whatever"
You can do so much better
I think we should get together now

And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again and again, and again, and again
S-s-so
Come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
Or, better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again and again, and again, and again
