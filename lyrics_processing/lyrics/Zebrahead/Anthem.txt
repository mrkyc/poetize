I got a girlfriend
Only she don't know it yet
I got a six string best friend (Whoa, whoa)
Who sleeps with a broken neck
I want to make my mark
Change the world, with this flow
But, all this doubt in my head
It won't let me go

Can't you see
I want to lock my door
And shut out all the world surrounding me (Yeah, let me go)
Safe from the problems and the pressures
Caused by insecurities

Get up, get up
Let the good times roll
Get up, get up
Take my heart and my soul
Get up, get up
Let the good times roll
On and on and on and on and on
You might also like
I feel like everybody else
Just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in
We shout the anthem of our lives (Come on and let me go)
And just like everybody else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives (Oooh)
The anthem of our lives (Oooh)

I got a heartache
She's my insecurity
I got all these words on my tongue
But they escape me (whoa, whoa)
I want to breakout, Carpe Diem
I know, but all this doubt in my head
It won't let me go

Can't you see I want to find my own direction
On this busy one-way street (Let me go)
Where all the influential people never bother helping me
Get up, get up
Let the good times roll
Get up, get up
Take my heart and my soul
Get up, get up
Let the good times roll
On and on and on and on and on

I feel like everybody else
Just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in
We shout the anthem of our lives (Come on and let me go)
And just like everybody else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives


This is the Anthem
Out to all the misfits
If you feel you don't belong
If you don't give a shit
About authority, about majority, about conformity
Shout it out
(Let us go, let us go, let us go, let us go
Let us go, let us go, let us go)
Get up, get up
Let the good times roll
Everybody else needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in
We shout the anthem of our lives
Just like everybody else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem of our lives (Come on and let me go)

I feel like everybody else
Just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in
We shout the anthem of our lives (Come on and let me go)
Just like everybody else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives (Get up, get up, let the good times roll)

The anthem, the anthem of our lives
(Get up, get up, take my heart and my soul
Get up, get up, let the good times roll
Get up, get up)
