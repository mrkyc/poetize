Don't got no job so he's thinking about stealin'
Cops on his 6 cause he looks like he be dealin'
High anxiety
My apologies
Tries to catch a break but he's stuck up in the rat trap
Medication on vacation cause he can't afford that
Flash back finger on the trigger ready for combat
High anxiety
Fake society
Are you right?
Are you wrong?
Do you think I think I don't belong?
You don't know anything at all about me
I won't be falling on my knees
Begging 'kill me, kill me please'
Cause you don't know anything at all me
Nothing about me
Got his hands in his pocket and his face is looking bloated
Had plans to advance then everything eroded
He gets fucked up to get fucked up, he's overloaded
High anxiety
No sobriety
Had a broad and a squad before everything got shitty
Now he's trippin' out on lean and crashing in the city
Got a tent with no rent on cement, oh what a pity
High anxiety
Fake society

I won't be falling on my knees
Begging 'kill me kill me please'
Cause you don't know anything at all about me
Nothing about me
Day after day
Another life in decay
Another person to blame in the society game
Are you your brother's keeper?
A sketchy creeper?
Should I get in deeper?
Do ya fear the reaper?
We are the prison and the jailor
We are hell bent on bad behavior
We are destined for failure
And that's fucked up to me
