Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh...
I'm kinda wasted
I'm sick of feeling like I always gotta chase it
I guess I'll do my best to fake it from now on
I'm medicated
I'm sick of feeling like I always gotta take it
I guess I'll try to suffocate it from now on
I'm sick of everything and everyone I know
I'm sick and tired, but I can't let it show
So, ohh I keep it to myself, myself
Keep it to myself, yeah!
Ohh I keep it to myself, myself
Keep it to myself!
I'm kinda jaded
I'm sick of feeling like I always gotta change it
I guess I'll do my best to make it from now on
I'm aggravated
I'm sick of feeling like I always gotta hate it
I guess I'll try to just forget it from now on
