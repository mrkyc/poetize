For a minute, she's stuck spinning in it
Still it's better to lose hope than dying in it
Off track, impact, slam
She's lying in it
Now she leads the way to the lost cost exhibit
You got to break through the walls that try to hold you
Fool you so that fear will always mold you
Push through, find that the walls are beneath you
End of the line is a brand new avenue

You said nothing in this world could ever
Make you feel better than I do (hey, hey)
You said no one in this world could ever
Take away all this from you
So hold on just a little longer
When you don't feel that you belong
All I want is a chance to fall into you
To fall into you

What a sin it's to find fulfillment in it
If it's better to crash land than flyin' in it
Violins, silence, anger violence
Says to herself "I'm going out of my mind"
You got to break through the walls that try to hold you
Fool you so that fear will always mold you
Push through, find that the walls are beneath you
End of the line is a brand new avenue

You said nothing in this world could ever
Make you feel better than I do (hey, hey)
You said no one in this world could ever
Take away all this from you
So hold on just a little longer
When you don't feel that you belong
All I want is a chance to fall into you

Break yourself from
Old ties that hold you down
You inspire me, You inspire me
I Know
I don't mind wasting time with you

You got to break through the walls that try to hold you
Fool you so that fear will always mold you
Push through, find that the walls are beneath you
End of the line is a brand new avenue
Avenue, yeah!

You said nothing in this world could ever
Make you feel better than I do (hey, hey)
You said no one in this world could ever
Take away all this from you
So hold on just a little longer
When you don't feel that you belong
All I want is a chance
For once, this is my chance to fall into you
To fall into you
