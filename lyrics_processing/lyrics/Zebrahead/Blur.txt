Did you ever get the feeling that you were all alone
And no one ever knew you and you never had a home
And the lights and the colors do their best to distract you?
Fuck you, I don't even know why I like you

It's all a blur, it's all a blur (take it off)
It's all a blur, it's all a blur (take it off)
Like a picture, it's all a blur

You don't know what you're missing
You don't know what you're missing
I've been trying so hard just to keep away
And now look where I am standing at today
Trying so hard to walk away
But it's impossible to watch you fade away
(To watch you fade away)

Did you ever stop believing after all was said and done
When you turned to your friends but they were long gone?
And the sky and the snapshots remind you
I trust you and I'm always going to miss you
You might also like
It's all a blur, it's all a blur (take it off)
Bring it back I said, it's all a blur, it's all a blur
Like a picture (take it off)
Reminds me who you were

You don't know what you're missing
You don't know what you're missing
I've been trying so hard just to keep away
And now look where I am standing at today
Trying so hard to walk away
But it's impossible to watch you fade away

Every time I see you look at me
I see those distant eyes and your looks are fading
And everytime you're next to me
I wanna talk and feel and act like we used to
'Cause everybody knows and everybody cares
Until they're walking in my shoes
And now I know, it's you I care and I loose

It's all a blur and I owe you
You can take it all when I call
Pick up the phone like you used to
It's all a blur like a picture
It's all a blur, your just a blur
I've been trying so hard just to keep away
And now look where I am standing at today
Trying so hard to walk away
But it's impossible to watch you fade away
(Try) trying so hard, I've been
Denying that I'm not your star
I've been crying, ridin' so far
But it's impossible to feel this space
Impossible to take your place
Impossible to watch you fade away
(To watch you fade away)
