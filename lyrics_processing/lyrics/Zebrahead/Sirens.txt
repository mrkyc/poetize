You can bury my heart with your box of lies
Cut me down to size, it's no surprise
You can stab me in the back and then cut all ties
Give me an "F", give me a "U"
Give me a "CK YOU" (FUCK YOU!)
Read between the lines, I guess love is blind
Want me to spell it out for you?
I hate long goodbyes, fuck off and die
You can bury my heart with your box of lies
Come on, pose with me in this sick machine
It looks like I'm going down in this murder scene
Try and try to bend and break me
I won't feel anything
Try and try to suffocate me
No pleasure like the pain
Sirens are calling
All's fair in love and war and
Words like bombs are falling down
Sirens are calling
All's fair in love and war and
I can't wait to bring you down
You might also likeGive me a "U" Give me an "R"
Give me "A bitch", yeah you are
Don't pretend to cry, kiss your ass goodbye
I've got 99 reasons why
Cut me down to size, it's no surprise
You can stab me in the back and then cut all ties
Come on, punish me if it's what you need
Tie me up, break me down, you can watch me bleed
Try and try to bend and break me
I won't feel anything
Try and try to suffocate me
No pleasure like the pain
Sirens are calling
All's fair in love and war and
Words like bombs are falling down
Sirens are calling
All's fair in love and war and
I can't wait to bring you down down down down down
Sirens are calling
All's fair in love and war and
Words like bombs are falling down down down down
Sirens are calling
All's fair in love and war and
Words like bombs are falling down down down down
Sirens are calling
All's fair in love and war and
