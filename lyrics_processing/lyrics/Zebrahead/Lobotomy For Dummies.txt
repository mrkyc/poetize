You can lie to me and say it's you I adore
You can poison me and drown me on the shore
You can kick me again when I'm down on the floor
(Give me some more, give me some more)
You say I'm desperate and if I'm desperate
At least I'm honest, at least I own it
And if I'm desperate, reap what you sow
(Give me some more, give me some more)

She said (she said) "Thanks for my misery"
Then I said (I said) "Hell needed company"
And maybe (maybe) a new lobotomy would
Make it easier to throw it all away (hey, hey, hey)
She said "I wish you were dead"

Left me out in the gutter to settle a score
Poured salt on my wounds when my stitches tore
And now I'm giving it back 'cause payback's a whore
I'm slamming the door, slamming the door
'Cause now I'm over and since I'm over it
I'll be honest, I think you're heartless
I think you need this, reap what you sow
I'm slamming the door, slamming the door
