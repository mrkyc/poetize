Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh
Lookin' out, look at me
Run it back then disagree
Wrong end of a killing spree
And the things that we want ain't free
Pound of flesh and a motorhome
So fresh in monochrome
Care less and your mouth will foam
Come and lay down in the catacombs
Fuck a piece, we walk the cake
Keepin' up on what's at stake
Till your backs about to break
You're sleep walking wide awake (They)
They ain't got heads against the wall, downfall
Middle fingers up, fuck the world, we want it all
It's never enough
I keep digging and digging
'Cause I need this more than you
It's never enough
I keep chasing and chasing
And my my heart's breaking me down

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh
Give it up, all to me
Ghost head of an amputee
Never think about hits in threes
Taking forced apologies
Bleeding out in the motorway
And no one knows just what to say
Paranoia's the price to pay
When you sound like Hemingway
Fuck the truth, we need the lies
Short film about our demise
To forget about compromise
Our apathy runs ocean-size (Bang)
Bang our heads against the walls, last call
Middle fingers up, fuck the world, we want it all
It's never enough
I keep digging and digging
'Cause I need this more than you
It's never enough
I keep chasing and chasing
And my heart's breaking me down
You want a piece? I'll take the whole thing
You want a piece? I'll take the whole thing
I'll take the sex and the drugs and the money like a rap king
Whatcha' think? It's hypnotic, right?
'Cause you can take ('Cause you can take) when you can fake the fight
I'm on it
I feel the chemicals shortin' out inside of my head
I taste the bad blood like an ocean drownin' everythin' red
I want more (I need more) I gotta have it
What's a fuckin' problem if I could just grab it?
It's never enough
I keep digging and digging
'Cause I need this more than you
It's never enough
I keep chasing and chasing
And my heart's breaking me down
It's never enough
I keep digging and digging
'Cause I need this more than you
Whoa
Whoa-oh-oh
