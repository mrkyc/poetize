The lights are on, but there is no one home
Yeah I'm the type of guy that shouldn't be left alone
They say just one more night of observation
There's nothing like a permanent vacation
(Hey-ho) break down like you want me to but I will not give control to you (hey-ho)
(Hey-ho) sniffed like a pound of glue forget all the things that you put me through
(Hey-ho) you left the residue now I'm nuts just like a blue cashew (hey-ho)
I go psycho, (psycho), psycho, (psycho)
And all I want is to go home, just for a bit (hey, hey, hey)
But these wadded rooms are the shit
(Woah-woah)
I'm happy in my mental health
(Woah-woah)
These conversations with myself
(Woah-woah)
They say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health
I'm happy in my mental health
One-two, one-two-three, go
You might also likeNow meet a friend of mine now where'd he go
He's probably sitting there, but you will never know
They say just one more shock (ow)
Try not to resist
They say lie down and bite on this
(Hey-ho) and let the shocks away cause the voices in my head are here to stay (hey-ho)
(Hey-ho) don't push your tests away but I get more drugs than the DEA
(Hey-ho) one day you'll do my brain they take your shoe laces away (hey-ho)
You go psycho, (psycho), psycho (psycho)
And all I want is to go home just for a bit (hey, hey, hey)
But these wadded rooms are the shit
(Woah-woah)
I'm happy in my mental health
(Woah-woah)
These conversations with myself
(Woah-woah)
They say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health
Straitjacket, bad habit
'Cause I live for the habit
This static, illmatic
Double dose is just like magic
Straitjacket, let's have it
You pump up all my panic
Welcome this is my life
A padded room up in the attic
And all I want is to go home just for a bit (hey, hey, hey)
But these wadded rooms are the shit
(Woah-woah)
I'm happy in my mental health
(Woah-woah)
These conversations with myself
(Woah-woah)
They say that only time will tell
Whatever, I'm happy in my mental health
(Psycho, psycho) I'm happy in my mental health (hey)
(Psycho, psycho) I'm happy in my mental health (hey)
(Psycho, psycho) I'm happy in my mental health (hey)
