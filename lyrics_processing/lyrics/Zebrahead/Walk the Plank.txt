Gonna give 'em hell
With a lie to tell
'Nother high to sell
I'm a broken shell
Wanna smack my bitch up
Light the rich up
Break the fucking code
Gonna lie awake
For the devil's sake
Like a give and take
Cause I'm gonna break
Want the fire to kick up
Crash my pick up
Die on abbey road
I keep the momentum by living
Perpetual state of locomotion
I try to defend it and end up by
Showing you shadows of my devotions
I walk the plank, and hope it's better down under the sea
I walk the plank, tell me will you take a walk with me?
It's not a lie if you can justify it all to your self
And when you die you're gonna go past the gates
Straight to hell
You might also likeI'm just a lost cause
Whoa
I'm just over my head
I'm better off dead
Cause I'm a lost cause
Whoa
I fell over the edge and I'm better left for dead
Getting hard to breathe
Choking underneath
Gotta soul to squeeze
Fallen on my knees
Want the guard to wake up
Wipe her make up
Let the violence grow
Gonna lose control
Of my mind and soul
With the time I stole
Down the rabbit hole
Wanna smack my bitch up
Light the rich up
Break the fucking code
I poison like venom and drink
In the doubt that drowns me in the ocean
I try to pretend in the end but clock keeps ticking to self implosion
I walk the plank and hope it's better down under the sea
I walk the plank, tell me will you take a walk with me?
It's not a lie if you can justify it all to your self
And when you die you're gonna go past the gates
Straight to hell
I'm just a lost cause
Whoa
I'm just over my head
I'm better off dead
Cause I'm a lost cause
Whoa
I fell over the edge and I'm left for dead
Whoa
I'm just a lost cause
Whoa
I fell over the edge and I'm better left for dead
Sink down to the bottom of the ocean with me
You couldn't imagine how many lost causes we'd see
Here and now, every second it's harder to breathe
Sink down, sink down
I'm just a lost cause
Whoa
I'm just over my head
I'm better off dead
Cause I'm a lost cause
Whoa
I fell over the edge and I'm left for dead
Whoa
I'm just a lost cause
Whoa
