When I stop looking out through a broken window
I know things are getting better
When I just break down that door
I can fall down, get pushed around
Plant myself into the ground but
I know things are getting better
'Cause it just can't get any worse than this
Trapped another one!
I'm bad fish, served on a cold dish
Never gonna get it right
'Cause I'm high and I'm foolish
I never fit in, no matter
Where I'm sittin'
If the story's got a hero
Then I guess that I'm the villain
So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh..)
What you got, what you got?
I'll keep my head low!
So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh..)
What you got, what you got?
Can't let it go!
I'll know things are getting better
When I stop looking out through a broken window
(Ooh-woah-oh-oh..)
I'll know things are getting better
When I just break down that door (HEY!)
Fall down, get pushed around
Plant myself into the ground but
I know things are getting better
'Cause it just can't get any worse than this

No it just can't get any worse than this
I spread a mean lie, my hope is low fly
Riding on a curse the worse my tank is bone dry
I'm fortune tellin', you're not buying what I'm sellin'
If that look is a cry, then call me a villain
So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh..)
What you got, what you got?
I'll keep my head low!
So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh..)
What you got, what you got?
Can't let it go!

(Ooh-woah-oh-oh..)
I'll know things are getting better
When I just break down that door (HEY!)
Fall down, get pushed around
Plant myself into the ground but
I know things are getting better
'Cause it just can't get any worse than this
So pathetic, just forget it now (Woah-oh-oh!)
Never make it sit and pass it round (Woah-oh-oh!)
Disappointment apathy, I'll take a double shot of misery (HEY!)
You can't fake it so far, hold it down (Woah-oh-oh!)
Yeah ignorance is bliss, but it can't get worse than this
I know things will get better
When I stop looking out through a broken window
I know things will get better
When I just break down that door
I can fall down, get pushed around
Plant myself into the ground but
I know things will get better
Cause it just can't get any worse
I know things will get better
