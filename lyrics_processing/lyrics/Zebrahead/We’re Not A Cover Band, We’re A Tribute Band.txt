Plug it in, steal the girls again
Scissor kicks, bitchin' licks and
Leather chaps and finger taps and
Tonight, we're gonna let the roof cave in
Raise hell, passing out again
Spandex, whipping necks and
Mic stands, leopard head bands
Plug in tune out, lets start the show
It's time to throw down, here we go
Don't touch that volume button
We don't care if the SWAT team comes knockin'
Hey-ho, welcome to the jungle
Oh-no, where is Mister Bungle?
Holiday in Cambodia
Help me, Knights of Cydonia
The bulls are on parade
There's anarchy in the UK
Cities all on flame with rock and roll tonight
Tonight, we're getting metal signs and
They'll crowd surf, jump in time again
Guitars, whammy bars and
High fives, stage dives and
Tonight, we're gonna melt your face and
There'll be pounding bass again
String bends, leather fringe and
Motorbikes, metal spikes and

We don't care if the SWAT team comes knockin'
Hey-ho, hi, my name is Jonas
Oh-no, our parents might disown us
Rock you like a hurricane
There's Cherub Rocks in LA Grange
The Mississippi Queen
She just won't talk dirty to me
Story of my life is just rock and roll all night
We got burn outs and in house we're down to play
And if your down with the sound, let me hear you say
We're no sell outs so you can put your cash away
Cause the basement stays open like early late
We got burn outs and in house we're down to play
And if your down with the sound, let me hear you say
We're no sell outs so you can put your cash away
Cause the basement stays open like early late
Hey-ho, hit me with your best shot
Oh-no, sabotage, I can't stop
The devil went down to Georgia
Pride and joy with a barracuda
It's raining blood on me
The cult of personality
The number of the beast is one
Hey-ho, welcome to the jungle
Oh-no, where is Mr Bungle?
Holiday in Cambodia
Help me, Knights of Cydonia
The bulls are on parade
There's anarchy in the UK
