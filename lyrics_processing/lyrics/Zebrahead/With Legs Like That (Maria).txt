Here she comes again, like good medicine
Every step she takes, my blood is flowing
Her legs go on and on for days
She's got a hold of me
I need the remedy
Just to hold her would, be a cure for me
I can't keep going on this way (I gotta get away, I gotta get away)

She's at the top of her game
She don't know my name
The future's looking weak
She's out of my league

Look out (Hey), she'll tear your heart out
Look out (Hey), she'll rock your world there's no doubt
She comes and goes when she wants to
I'll do anything she wanted me to (Wanted me to)
Who would blame me, with legs like that

Here she comes again, she makes me wanna sin
My heart stops when I think about her coming
Her legs go on and on for days (On and on and on and on)
She's got a hold on me
It's a tragedy
That I would never get a chance to have her close to me
When she moves, she takes my breath away (She moves and she moves and she moves)

She's breaking me down
She's at the top way that I wanna go
Breaking me down
She gets me high when I'm feelin' low
Breaking me down
She's on the move like the Rolling Stones
Breaking me down
Just one run gets me to the go

She's at the top of her game
She don't know my name
