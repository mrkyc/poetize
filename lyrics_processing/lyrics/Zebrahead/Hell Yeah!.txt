Whoo
Punk rock, tripping with
The flavor of hip hop
Spitting out venom as I'm
Watching all your heads bob
Representing for the outcasts
And the have-nots
Fiending to find light
In a world that has blacked out
Well, middle fingers up (yeah, put 'em up)
We've had enough
We take our shots to the chin
With a grin, we're tough
We know exactly why you're here
So make it clear (let's go)
We know you want to
Let's go, let's go
Hell yeah, hell yeah
(We want control)
Hell yeah, hell yeah
(A scene to call our own)
Hell yeah, hell yeah
(I grip the microphone)
(And we're picking up speed)
(Like a rolling stone)

We can't live forever
(One note)
The louder, the better
(So let's go)
We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell yeah, let's go
(Let's go)
We can't live forever
(One note)
The louder, the better
(So let's go)
We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell yeah, let's go
Rising from the ash, counter clash
And there is no doubt
Swinging from the rafters
Are the kids who never sold out
Holding out for hope, this shit is dope
Hear the crowds shout
Fighting to survive
But one day we'll make them tap out
Well, raise your voices up (yeah, raise 'em up)
We've had enough
We're standing up
And now we're being heard
The gloves are off
The voices loud
We have the crowd
The time is now, let's go
We know you want to
Let's go, let's go
Hell yeah, hell yeah
(We want control)
Hell yeah, hell yeah
(A scene to call our own)
Hell yeah, hell yeah
(I grip the microphone)
(And we're picking up speed)
(Like a rolling stone)
(Let's go)
We can't live forever

The louder, the better

Hell yeah, let's go
(Let's go)
We can't live forever
(One note)
The louder, the better
(So let's go)
We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell yeah, let's go
(Get up tonight)
(Stand up and fight)
(They are here, they are inside)
(They're inside)
(And I can't go alone)
(On this microphone)
(Is this on?)
(Is this on?)
This flow, definitive
Make your throat hurt
A gagged voice
With no choice is so limited
Hell yeah (come on)
Hell yeah (it's on)
Bounce to the boom
Of the beat of the drum, drum
(Let's go)
We can't live forever
(One note)
The louder, the better
(So let's go)
We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell yeah, let's go
(Let's go)
We can't live forever
(One note)
The louder, the better
(So let's go)
We're in this together
Can you hear me?
Hell yeah, let's go
(Oh)
(Oh)
