I broke down on a Japanese street
Words unsaid, they scar so deep
Bullshit, Palahniuk, both make me choke
Too much JD, too much coke
She says speed up, I wanna go faster
She holds on, I outlast her
Build it up, but what does that matter?
We can build it up, but we always watch it shatter

Get up, get up, the house is on fire
Get up, get up, I want to get higher
Get up, get up, you motherfucking liar
You make me feel alone

I burned out in Shibuya station
Lost all my friends, hazard occupation
Manic Compression like quicksand slip
Ate too many mushrooms, I'm gonna be sick
She says slow down, you're going through the motions
I start to crash like a plane in the ocean
Build it up, but what does that matter?
When the shit goes down, we all fucking scatter
You might also like
Get up, get up, the house is on fire
Get up, get up, I want to get higher
Get up, get up, you motherfucking liar
You make me feel alone
Get up, get up, the house is on fire
Get up, get up, I want to get higher
Get up, get up, you motherfucking liar
You make me feel alone
Post-Chorus: Justin Mauriello
Never said I wanted to try
Never said I wanted to live this lie
All you said was goodbye
All I ever said was to get me out of here

I focus on the flame (Set it off)
Wasted, what a shame (Set it off)
Focus on the flame (Set it off)
We were once the same
Set it off

Get up, get up, the house is on fire
Get up, get up, I want to get higher
Get up, get up, you motherfucking liar
You make me feel alone
Post-Chorus: Justin Mauriello
Never said I wanted to try
Never said I wanted to live this lie
All you said was goodbye
All I ever said was to get me out of here

Get up, get up, the house is on fire
Get up, get up, I want to get higher
Get up, get up, you motherfucking liar
