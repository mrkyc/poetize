If this is it, then I've given all I can
The road that leads to nowhere has fallen in my hands
If this is it, then the needle has been found
The haystack is long gone and the world's turned upside down

I see right through you
Everything you do
Leech on the side of me
Covert hostility, your negativity
Drains to get what you need
Your vampire logic turned out tragic
Lost your meal ticket to feed
Karma got to you ego ate through you
Nothing left to do but to bleed

Now out come the wolves
Out come the wolves
Out come the wolves
Out come the wolves

Cave in, just surrender
You know you're already six-feet down
Cave in, just surrender
'Cuz you have nowhere to go but down
You might also like
Right now it's over
Right now it's over
Right now it's over
Right now

Your friends
Call them yes men
Ain't always the best men to trust in or to believe
The credit you were taking
Let's just call it faking
Is obvious, everyone can see
Got a good ride on our coat tails
Now it's time to set sail
And leave you tied up to the tree
Karma got to you ego ate through you
Nothing left to do but to bleed

Now out come the wolves
Out come the wolves
Out come the wolves
Out come the wolves

Cave in, just surrender
You know you're already six-feet down
Cave in, just surrender
'Cuz you have nowhere to go but down
Out come, out come the wolves
Out come, out come the wolves
Out come, out come the wolves
Out come, out come the wolves
Come and get it
They can smell it
Fear is what controls you
If you let it
It will divot
Your entire soul through
They're on to you
Come and get it
They can smell it
Fear is what controls you
If you let it
It will divot
Your entire soul through
They're on to you
They're on to
They're on to you

Cave in, just surrender
You know you're already six-feet down
Cave in, just surrender
'Cuz you have nowhere to go
Cave in, just surrender
You know you're already six-feet down
Cave in, just surrender
'Cuz you have nowhere to go but down
Right now it's over
Right now it's over
Right now it's over
