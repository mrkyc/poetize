I always find a reason why to waste
My day with you
(Way while the record)
(Way while the record)
(Way while the record spins, spins...)
I got a list of demands and no antidote
Green thumb on my hand and some hope to float
Since then you've had a hold of me by the throat
Back alley, on the wall, the graffiti wrote
Hold on, wait up
Enjoy the smoke
Take time, red wine
And the levy broke
It's hard to throw away what the rush dragged in
Wanna go all the way while the record spins (spins, spins, spins...)
Wasting away the day again
Wasting away the day
I've been wasting all the day away
I'm so close yet far away (far away)
Still I'm wasting away the day
Again
You haunt me and you hypnotize
You write the tale of my demise
Begins and ends with you
(Way while the record)
(Way while the record)
(Way while the record spins, spins...)
You might also likeI got a one way ticket and a fight to throw
I'm a house of cards falling like dominos
You will always be the one that I can't let go
The hieroglyphics on my arm mean take it slow
Hold on, wait up
Enjoy the jokes
Take time, red wine
And the moment spoke
It's hard to throw away what the rush dragged in
Wanna go all the way while the record spins (spins, spins, spins...)
Wasting away the day again
Wasting away the day
I've been wasting all the day away
I'm so close yet far away (far away)
Still I'm wasting away the day
Again
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
No matter how hard I try
I always find a reason why to waste
My day with you
Wasting away the day again (I'm wasting away)
Wasting away the day (I'm wasting away)
I've been wasting all the day away
I'm so close yet far away (far away)
Still I'm wasting away the day
Again
(Oh, I'm wasting away, I'm wasting away, I'm wasting away)
