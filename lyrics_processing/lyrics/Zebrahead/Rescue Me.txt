Another tragedy in the news
Someone shooting down the right to choose
It doesn't seem at all that they chose the right way
(Yo, man, your goin' the wrong way)
Another law I heard got passed today
Someone's trying to take my rights away
It doesn't seem to me they chose the right way
(Hey, man, we're goin' the wrong way)

It's out of my hands
But stuck in my mind
In time I find my spine is crooked in design (design)
I wanna be so much more (more)
I wanna be so much, much

Rescue me
Take this hand, by myself, alone I stand
Rescue me
From this world, from myself, before I grow old
Someone rescue me

Does anybody ever feel this way?
Does anybody have the guts to say?
It doesn't seem at all they chose the right way
(Yo, man, you're goin' the wrong way)
Who am I to say I disagree?
Who am I not to change a thing?
Because I don't believe they chose the right way
(Hey man, you're going the wrong way)
It's out of my hands
But stuck in my mind
In time I find my spine is crooked in design (design)
I wanna be so much more (more)
I wanna be so much, much

Rescue me
Take this hand, by myself, alone I stand
Rescue me...
From this world, from myself, before I grow old
Here it comes again

Excuse too weak to stand on (I'm fallin' off)
Too weak to stand on (I'm fallin' off)
Too weak to hang on
Fallin' for you to catch me
Excuse too weak to stand on (I'm fallin' off)
Too weak to stand on (I'm fallin' off)
Too weak to hang on (I'm fallin')
Fallin' for you to catch me, catch me

I'm afraid
That no one is changing
Who's to blame?
Someone save me
Rescue me
Take this hand, by myself, alone I stand
Rescue me
From this world, from myself, before I grow old
Someone rescue me

Save me now, you gotta save me now (save me)
Save me now, someone rescue me
Save me now, you gotta save me now (save me)
