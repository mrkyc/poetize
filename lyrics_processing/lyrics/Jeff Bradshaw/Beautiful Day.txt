Do your thing, we could get together
Till the sun goes away, you're back again
This is a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day don't you gotta
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the moon goes down, background
It's a beautiful day
It's just such a beautiful thing
Dreamt a dream of clouds
In night sky
Such a beautiful thing
Whispered pretty questions
To a humming bird
He flew away with his response
And I never saw him again
But occasionally the anticipation
Returns within
A herd of butterflies
Such a beautiful thing
Once over a round table surrounded by feline wizards
Swirl by over standing of the unknown
A secret of you was delivered to me
For the small fee of thirty Stirling
You might also likeAnd then large cost of now knowing, knowledge
Knowing you such a beautiful thing
It's a beautiful day don't you wanna
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the sun goes away, you're back again
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day don't you gotta
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the moon goes down, background
It's a beautiful day
Such a beautiful thing
Now every moment may be that now
But I always knew that
How beautiful, how beautiful
Now within a silence, serenaded by sound
In the presence of artificial light
I am overwhelmed by the flames of the candle
How beautiful
And I find myself searching again
'Cause this time could be that time again
And it's beautiful, what to do?
Definitely appropriate for me to be nice, right now
'Cause you got pretty teeth
And a pretty smile
And pretty eyes and
Excuse me could I know your name?
It's a beautiful day don't you wanna
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the sun goes away, you're back again
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day don't you gotta
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the moon goes down, background
It's a beautiful day
Ya, ya, ya, check the solo
It's a beautiful day don't you wanna
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the sun goes away, you're back again
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day don't you gotta
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the moon goes down, background
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day don't you wanna
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the sun goes away, you're back again
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day don't you gotta
Do your thing, we could get together
Till the moon goes down, back around
