I don't believe you that you don't want me (tick tock, tick tock)
I don't believe that you can just walk away
And if you don't think this is something (tick tock, tick tock)
Then all I can do is kneel, kneel down and pray
I believe
I believe in love
I believe the light shine through your eyes
While I wait for a sign, well baby that's fine
But, why waste your time
You know you're gonna be mine
You know you're gonna be mine
You know you're gonna be mine
Isn't it clear
You'll listen baby, then you will hear
You know just how I feel
You know you're gonna be
I believe

I don't believe you wanna play stupid (tick tock, tick tock)
I don't believe that you could just fade away
And if you wanna front and be stupid (tick tock, tick tock)
Then all I can do is kneel, kneel down and pray
You might also like
I believe
I believe in love
I believe the light shine through your eyes
While I wait for a sign, well baby that's fine
But, why waste your time
You know you're gonna be mine
You know you're gonna be mine
You know you're gonna be mine
Isn't it clear
You'll listen baby, then you will hear
You know just how I feel
You know you're gonna be
I believe

Come over here
Tell me just how you feel
It's gonna be so nice
Hold me all through the night
Come over here
Don't you make me wait
Don't you hesitate
You're gonna be
Why waste your time
You know you're gonna be mine
You know you're gonna be mine
You know you're gonna be mine
Isn't it clear
You'll listen baby, then you will hear
You know just how I feel
You know you're gonna be
