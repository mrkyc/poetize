But you, you, you only tell my friends
That you, you, you know, you are my kind
But you, you, you turn away my smile
Oh, I know I should be so strong
But I, I don't wanna waste no time
And I, I don't wanna fight no more
But I, I've got to hear this thing from you
Screaming, shouting anyway, anyway
Anyway you wanna go
Screaming, shouting anyway, anyway
Anyway you wanna go about it
So tell me I need your loving
I think I love it
Tell me I want you by my side
You know, I know that you want my loving
Now tell me
And you, you, you know away forever
But you, you, you take me to the end
And you, you know I'll be gone
But you, you know my time is precious
You might also likeOh, I know I should be so strong
