Just say hey, if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright

Pay attention, listen here
Crystal's gonna make it clear
Everybody here tonight
Better have a real good time
Let your hair down and decide
Come go with me for the ride
Don't sit down, get on up
Join with the rest of us

Hands in the air waving
I want your body shaking
Boot stomping, music rocking
No, we ain't never stopping
Higher and higher, we're going higher
Higher and higher, were going...

Just say hey, if it feels alright
Just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright

It's the slam, it's the jam
Every child, woman and man
Use your skills you possess
If you wanna pass this test
Don't conserve, just go wild
Turn it up until it's loud
Scream and shout, use your lungs
Y'all join in, let's have some fun

Hands in the air waving
I want your body shaking
Boot stomping, music rocking
No, we ain't never stopping
Higher and higher, we're going higher
Higher and higher, were going...
