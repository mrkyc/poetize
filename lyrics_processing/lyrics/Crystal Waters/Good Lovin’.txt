Good lovin', good lovin'
You give good lovin'
Good lovin', good lovin'
You give good lovin'
Good lovin', good lovin'
You give good lovin'
Good lovin', good lovin'
People stare while I'm walking down the street
If they would close their eyes they know this how it feels
You'll need my body more every time we meet
It's just the taste of love that we seek
It's little shiver and it's much too hot
It's the best desire than you're givin' me
It's a little quiver and it's much too much
It's the best desire than you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
This feeling pours from my head to my feet
My body churns and burns from the heat
As I remember I tremble from the strain
Forever your love'll be locked in my brain
It's little shiver and it's much too hot
It's the best desire than you're givin' me
It's a little quiver and it's much too much
It's the best desire than you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
Back and forth eyes smile at me
And the taste of your tongue is oh so sweet
Your mouth opens wide as our body locks
I feel the pleasure and the treasure from the start
It's little shiver and it's much too hot
It's the best desire than you're givin' me
It's a little quiver and it's much too much
It's the best desire than you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give good lovin', that's what you're givin' me
You give me, you give me
You give me, you give good lovin'
You give me, you give me
You give me, you give good lovin'
You give me, you give me
You give me, you give good lovin'
You give me, you give me
You give me, you give good lovin'
You give me, you give me
You give me, you give good lovin'
You give me, you give me
You give me, you give good lovin'
You give me, you give me
You give me, you give good lovin'
You give me, you give me
