I feel a little fantastic
I'm in the club knee deep
I feel a little Freaky Deek-y
My pretty baby don't care
My baby don't care, no
Watch while I strut my hinnie
Flip my skirt to the breeze
Call me... freak of the... freak of the week... freak of the week
Yes, I'm a freak, I'll never be alone
I rock the floor until the morning comes
Escape thru the music, let my worries go free
Shake off the world, let 'em think I'm just a freak
Tisket a tasked
I feel a little pre school-astic
I paint my hair green
I, I wear it down to my feet, yeah
My pretty baby don't care
My baby don't care, no
Let my inhibitions go free
Throw my cares to the street
I'm freak of the... I'm freak of the week
Yes, I'm a freak, I'll never be alone
I rock the floor until the morning comes
Escape thru the music, let my worries go free
Shake off the world, let 'em think I'm just a freak

Escape thru the music, let my worries go free
Shake off the world, let 'em think I'm just a freak
My baby don't care (My pretty baby)
My baby don't care (My baby don't care)
My baby (My baby)
My baby (My baby)

Mary Mary's on the floor
She's looking freak but she's much more
Le Chic Sun Chic, she's the head of state patrol
Head to toe a shade of peach
But there's a secret she likes to keep
She likes the boys, thinks they're cool
But between her legs hide the family jewels
There is a place we all want to be free
Find yourself, don't worry what they think
Letting go is where you'll find some relief
No one gets hurt, they just might call you a freak
Yes, I'm a freak, I'll never be alone
I rock the floor until the morning comes
Escape thru the music, let my worries go free
Shake off the world, let 'em think I'm just a freak
Yes, I'm a freak, I'll never be alone
I rock the floor until the morning comes
Escape thru the music, let my worries go free
Shake off the world, let 'em think I'm just a freak
Yes, I'm a freak, I'll never be alone
I rock the floor until the morning comes
Escape thru the music, let my worries go free
