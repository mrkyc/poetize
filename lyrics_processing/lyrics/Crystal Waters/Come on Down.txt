Don't you wanna party, body to body?
We all need some healin' baby, touch the ceilin'
When the beat is thumpin' keep your body jumpin'
DJ's got the rhythm come on, get with'im

It's just a feeling, just a feeling, what is this feel that I feel?
That is real when you're near? Love that you're near
And when I close my eyes, it's all that I hear

Come on down, come on down
Hey, don'tcha wanna party? Party with me
Come on down

Yes, you are the answer, baby, there's no question
Magic seems to happen, when we're dancin'
The music's got me swayin', love has got me prayin'
Tell me what the deal is, come on, let's hear it

It's just a feeling, just a feeling, what is this feel that I feel
That is real when you're near? Love, that you're near
And when I close my eyes, it's all that I hear
You might also like
Come on down, come on down
Hey, don'tcha wanna party? Party with me
Come on down
Come on down, come on down
Hey, don'tcha wanna party? Party with me
Come on down

Come on down and dance, let us make a romance
Let the music come and move ya, let the beat get into you
Come and share with me, come and dare with me
There is somethin' 'bout tonight and I know that it's right

It's just a feeling, just a feeling, what is this feel that I feel
That is real when you're near? Love that you're near
And when I close my eyes, it's all that I hear

Come on down, come on down
Hey, don'tcha wanna party? Party with me
Come on down, come on down
Shake it loose and let it go
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down
Hey don'tcha wanna party? Party with me
Come on down, come on down
Shake it loose and let it go
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down
