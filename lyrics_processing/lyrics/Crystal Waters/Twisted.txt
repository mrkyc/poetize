That I was right out of my head
The way he described it
He said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along
He was all wrong
And I knew that he thought
I was crazy but I'm not, oh no
My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
He said I'd need treatment
But I'm not that easily led
He said I was the type
That was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts
No more ifs or ands or buts, oh no
They say as a child
I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas
But I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius
What's so strange when you know
That you're a wizard at three
I knew that this was meant to be
You might also likeWell, I heard little children
Were supposed to sleep tight
That's why I drank up all vodka one night
My parents got frantic
Didn't know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes
Before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy
I may have been only three
But I was swinging
They laughed at angry young men
They all laughed at Edison
And also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry
If they just couldn't understand
The idiomatic logic
That went on in my head
I had a brain, it was insane
Oh, they used to laugh at me
When I refused to ride
On all those double decker buses
Because there was no driver on the top
My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
The way he described it
He said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along
That he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought
I was crazy but I'm not, oh no
My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
I said dear doctor
I think that it's you instead
Because I have got a thing
That's unique and new
And to prove it I'll have
The last laugh on you
'Cause instead of one head, I got two
