(So Happy) On a dark street in the back seat of his car
Him and her, where they're goin', they're goin' too far
On the floor by the door of her house
She screams "Ah-ooh-ah", she sounds just like a mouse
Now picture you with me on a lonely beach
We'll see how high we both can reach
Can you hear us all say, ooh-wee?
Ah ooh-wee ooh, ooh-wee ooh, ooh-wee, ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Just makin' happy, makin' happy, happy, happy, happy
Why don't you make me happy?

Ah ooh-wee ooh, ooh-wee ooh, ooh-wee ooh-wee ooh-wee
(So happy) Ah ooh-wee ooh, ooh-wee ooh

You just couldn't put up, put up a silly fight
You're in the tub, scrub and scrub, ah-ooh-ah

Now picture you with me on a lonely beach
We'll see how high we both can reach
