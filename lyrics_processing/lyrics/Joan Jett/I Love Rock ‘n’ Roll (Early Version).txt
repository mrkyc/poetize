I knew he must have been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah me
Singin'
I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
Ow!
He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
But that don't matter, he said 'cause it's all the same
He said, "Can I take you home
Where we can be alone?"
And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
Next we were moving on
He was with me, yeah me
