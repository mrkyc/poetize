Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less

Love me with a tender touch
Kindness, I need very much
It is so hard for me to trust
But deep inside I know I must

(Come on) Love me all through the night
Hug me 'til the first rays of sunlight
Be sweet, make me unafraid
'Cause tonight, I'll lay with you, please be gentle

Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less

Love me, try to be understanding
Tenderness is all that I'm asking
Don't feel like I'm making conditions
I wanna to overcome my inhibitions
