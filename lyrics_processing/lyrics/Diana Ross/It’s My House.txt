It's my house and I live here
It's my house and I live here

There's a welcome mat at the door
And if you come on in
You're gonna get much more
There's my chair
I put it there
Everything you see
Is with love and care

It's my house and I live here
I wanna tell you
It's my house and I live here

On the table, there sits a rose
Through every window
A little light flows
Books of feeling on the shelf above
'Cause it was built for love
It was built for love

Where my dreams await someone to share

And good vibrations won't let you go
