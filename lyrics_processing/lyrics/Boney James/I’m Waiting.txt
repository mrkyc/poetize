I'm waiting
Boy, I'm always waiting for my plane to come
For the show to stop, for you to break my heart
I'm waiting
Shawty, do you wanna win the game?
Gonna take the fame, can we try it again?
In my own place, you tell me we're through
Now you're back again asking me to
See if I can take it, I know that you can fake it
Wait for time to pass so you pass the time
Time for you to stay or go
Can't let my feelings show, no, no
Boy, I'm always waiting for the page to turn
For my light to shine and get together
I'm waiting
Boy, I'm always waiting for my plane to come
For the show to stop, for you to break my heart
I'm waiting
