Never felt this way like I am paralyzed
But I can't stay like this forever
You're pulling on my strings any way you want
Are we in or, are we out or, together?

You need to tell me either way (say you will)
Can no longer be afraid (say you won't)
Need to say it either way (how you feel)
Gotta tell me if you will or you won't -- will you stay?

We have so many options we both could entertain
But I only have eyes for you
I feel some apprehension when it's the same you claim
We just to get to the truth

Need to tell me either way (say you will)
Can no longer be afraid (say you won't)
Need to say it either way (how you feel)
Gotta tell me if you will or you won't -- will you stay?

Cause you need to tell me either way (say you will)
Can no longer be afraid, no no (say you won't)
Need to say it either way
Gotta tell me if you will or you won't -- will you stay?
Tell me (tell me if you will) (say you will)
(tell me if you won't) What you want
(tell me if you will) (say you won't)
(tell me if you won't) Say you will, say you won't
Either way, I need to know (tell me if you will) (say you will)
(tell me if you won't) Oh, won't you tell me?
(tell me if you will) (say you won't) I need to know it
(tell me if you won't)
