Keep shining
Shine on me, your smile
Show so brightly
You shine on me, I get a taste of heaven now
I just love it when you shine on me
Day breaks, I see your face
Nothing but is common place
Think, I think I caught a case
Of your love
So fresh like morning dew
Honey, I'm in love with you
Got that special something on
I can't get enough
Can't wait till each day begins
So I can see your face again
Wish you could feel just how I feel
Then you know it was real, I just love it when you shine on me
Shine on me, your smile
Show so brightly
You shine on me, I get a taste of heaven now
I just love it when you shine on me
