I think I can speak for all men when I say
There's something exceptional, unique
About a woman

Your Colgate smile
Those pretty brown eyes
Like heaven, smooth skin
Your hair in the wind
That lives in those hills
That switch all in your walk
That sexy way you talk, girl
Like a DaVinci painting art, girl

And I, if I can make you with a magic wand
I will make you no other kind of way
You was made by the Maker of love (Nah, nah)
You was made by the Maker of love
Baby, listen, I said I wouldn't change a thing
I want you, couldn't have you no other kind of way
You was made by the Maker of love (You're exceptional)
You was made by the Maker of love

Your Body Bath Works
Them hips in that skirt
The smell of a fragrance
Ooh, the taste of a sweet kiss
The passion, the thrill
Goosebumps and the chills
Thy wish is thy will
And I'd do anything for you
See when it comes to you
