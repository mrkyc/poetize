I don't know why
It took me so long
To see you were the one for me
How could I be so wrong?
Why was I so blind?
It was obvious to see
You were right there in front of me
And I was still

Searching, wondering, girl
(Ooh, but you were right there and I)
Didn't know 'til now
(I just wanna be)
(Close to you)
And I will do anything
To be by your side
And be close to you
(Close to you)
There ain't no other place
Nothing I wouldn't face
To be close to you

I'll write this one down
And sing this melody
So this is the one mistake
I never will repeat
I promise this to you
It is my guarantee
I will be true to you
Won't ever be
