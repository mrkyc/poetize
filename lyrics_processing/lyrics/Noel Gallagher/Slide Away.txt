My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now
Hold me down, all the world's asleep
I need you now, you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you and we talk of growing old
But you said: "please, don't!"
Slide in, baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying, but I don't know what you're saying to me
Now that you're mine
We'll find a way of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning
We don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way to do what we've done
Let me be the one that shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now
You might also likeSlide in, baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying and I know just what you're saying to me
Now that you're mine
We'll find a way of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning
We don't know what to do
We're two of a kind
We'll find a way to do what we've done
Oh, let me be the one that shines with you
And we can slide away
And I want to try now
I'm gonna make you mine now
And I want to try now
I'm gonna make you mine now
And I want to try now
I'm gonna make you mine now
I don't know, I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
I don't know, I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
(Slide away)
I don't know, I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
(Slide away)
I don't know, I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
(Slide away)
I don't know, I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
(Slide away)
Take me there, take me there, take me there
(Slide away)
All I know is you can take me there
