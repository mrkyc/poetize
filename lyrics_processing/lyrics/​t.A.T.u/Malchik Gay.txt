Handsome, tender, soft
Why do you look right through me
Thinking
"No, I can't deny my feelings"
Growing strong
I try to keep believing, dreaming on
And every time I see you, I crave more
I wanna pull you closer, closer, closer, closer
But you leave me feeling frozen

Malchik gay, malchik gay
I can be all you need
Won't you please stay with me
Malchik gay, malchik gay
Apologies, might-have-been's
Malchik gay, malchik gay
Can't erase what I feel
Malchik gay, gay
Malchik gay
Malchik gay, Malchik gay, malchik gay
Malchik, malchik
You might also like
Choking back emotion
I try to keep on hoping
For a way;
A reason for us both to
Come in close
I long for you to hold me
Like your boyfriend does
And though my dream is
Slowly fading
I wanna be the object
Object, object, object
Of your passion but it's hopeless

Malchik gay, malchik gay
I can be all you need
Won't you please stay with me
Malchik gay, malchik gay
Apologies, might-have-been's
Malchik gay, malchik gay
Can't erase what I feel
Malchik gay, gay
Malchik gay
Malchik gay, malchik gay
I can be all you need
Won't you please stay with me
Malchik gay, malchik gay
Apologies, might-have-been's
Malchik gay, malchik gay
Can't erase what I feel
Malchik gay, gay
Malchik gay
Mal'chik-gei, mal'chik-gei
Bud' so mnoi ponaglei
Ot stida ne krasnei
Mal'chik-gei, mal'chik-gei
Polozhi na druzei
Mal'chik-gei, mal'chik-gei
Ot menya ofigei
Mal'chik-gei, gei

Malchik gay, malchik gay
I can be all you need
Won't you please stay with me
Malchik gay, malchik gay
Apologies, might-have-been's
