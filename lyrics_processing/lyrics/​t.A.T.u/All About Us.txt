They say, they don't trust
You, me, we, us
So we'll fall, if we must
'Cause it's you, me, and it's all about
It's all about

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us, all about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause ya know (Ah-ah)
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us, all about us
We'll run away if we must
'Cause ya know (Ah-ah)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you, I can trust (It's all about us)
It's all about us

If they hurt you
They hurt me too
So we'll rise up
Won't stop, and it's all about
It's all about
You might also like
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us, all about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause ya know (Ah-ah)
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us, all about us
We'll run away if we must
'Cause ya know (Ah-ah)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you, I can trust (It's all about us)
It's all about us

They don't know
They can't see
Who we are
Fear is the enemy
Hold on tight
Hold on to me
'Cause tonight

It's all about us
It's all about, all about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause ya know (Ah-ah)
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us, all about us
There's a thing that they can't touch
'Cause ya know (Ah-ah)
It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us, all about us
We'll run away if we must
'Cause ya know (Ah-ah)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
It's all about us (It's all about us)
In you, I can trust (It's all about us)
It's all about us
