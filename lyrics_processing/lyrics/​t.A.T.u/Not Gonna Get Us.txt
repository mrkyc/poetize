Not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us, not gonna get us
Not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us, not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
Not gonna get us

Starting from here, let's make a promise
You and me, let's just be honest
We're gonna run, nothing can stop us
Even the night, that falls all around us
Soon there will be laughter and voices
Beyond the clouds, over the mountains
We'll run away on roads that are empty
Lights from the airfield (Shining upon you)

Nothing can stop this
Not now, I love you
They're not gonna get us, they're not gonna get us
Nothing can stop this
Not now, I love you
They're not gonna get us, they're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us (Not gonna get us)
They're not gonna get us

(Not gonna get us)
Not gonna get us
Not gonna get us
Not gonna get us (Not gonna get us)
Get us
(Not gonna get us)

We'll run away, keep everything simple
Night will come down, our guardian angel
We rush ahead, the crossroads are empty
Our spirits rise, they're not gonna get us
My love for you, always forever
Just you and me, all else is nothing
Not going back, not going back there
They don't understand, they don't understand us

(Not gonna get us)
(Not gonna get us)
(Not gonna get us)
They're not gonna get us, not gonna get us

Nothing can stop this
Not now, I love you
They're not gonna get us, they're not gonna get us
Nothing can stop this
Not now, I love you
They're not gonna get us, they're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us (Not gonna get us)
They're not gonna get us (Not gonna get us)
Not gonna get us (Not gonna get us)
Not gonna get us (Not gonna get us)
Not gonna get us
