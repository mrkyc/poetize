Games we don't wanna play
Same winner everyday
Kill for the second best
Feel no more, feel no less
We have our minutes cut
We lose our feelings but
That's what the movies show
This is where stories go

Stars we don't wanna reach
Scars we don't wanna stitch
Go where we haven't been
Fly away, time machine
Clouds, we will chase them out
Crowds, we will face them down
This is our secret place
Outer space, outer space

Our home forever is outer space
Black stars and endless seas, outer space
New hope, new destinies, outer space
Forever we'll be in outer space, outer space

Ground we don't wanna feel
Found what they didn't steal
Time; we were really lost
Bridges burnt, fingers crossed
We, shall we ever be
Free with no guarantee?
Life on another plane
Same before, same again

Go where you wanna go
So no one ever knows
Only what we decide
Is it gone, has it died?
Dry every tear in my eye
You can tell me why
This is our secret place
Outer space, outer space

Our home forever is, outer space
Black stars and endless seas, outer space
New hope, new destinies, outer space
Forever we'll be in outer space, outer space
Outer space is where we get together
In this place we're meant to be
Stars are dancing and the time is fading
Die forever, you and me, you and me
Passing stars and counting moons of planets
In the cosmos, we are free
There's no atmosphere and no obsessions
It'll always be, it'll always be

Our home forever is, outer space
Black stars and endless seas, outer space
New hope, new destinies, outer space
Forever we'll be in outer space, outer space
Our home forever is, outer space
Black stars and endless seas, outer space
New hope, new destinies, outer space
