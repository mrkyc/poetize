Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes, since we found out, since we found out
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could


After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour

But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could

Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes, since we found out, since we found out
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could

I know it's gonna be, I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be, I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be, I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be, I know it's gonna be, oh
(But I don't think I need you)
(But I don't think I need you)
