We
We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the lights started out
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
