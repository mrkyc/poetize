Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said
When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met
Don't forget me, like I didn't care
Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete

(Flux, flux)
I don't think you have the patience
I don't think you know the difference
(Flux, flux)
And I don't want cute imitations
I know you wanted to save me

And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on

Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know

When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas
You might also like
(Flux, flux)
I should be counting my blessings
Staying safe in confusion
(Flux, flux)
And maybe I'm learning my lesson
I know you wanted to save me

I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on

Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Would we be living in Camden?
Getting a ticket to your band?
I wanna know, I wanna know

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, I'm still in love with the idea of loving you (Oh, with the idea)
It's a state of flux (It's a state of)
But it's not enough (It's not enough)
I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on
(Oh, I just keep holding on)
I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough (Oh, I'm still in love)
I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
