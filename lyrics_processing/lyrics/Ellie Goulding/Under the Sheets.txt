Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys

You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a handprint on the door
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before
This is our luck, baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, to scale the map to get us back on track

I've seen you in a fight you lost
I've seen you in a fight

We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
You might also like
In here, the world won't bring us down
Our plan is gold dust
Out there, a lonely girl could drown
In here, we're frozen
Where did the people go?
My hands are empty
You're not the answer, I should know
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before

We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me

We're in a mess, babe, we're in a mess, babe
Your more is less, babe, oh (Oh)
We're in a mess, babe, we're in a mess, babe
Your more is less, babe, oh, oh

We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me (I've seen you in a fight you lost)
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
Oh, you're killin' me, you're killin' me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
