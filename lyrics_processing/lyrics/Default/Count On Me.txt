I know that life ain't always good to you
I've seen exactly what it's put you through
Thrown you around and turned you upside down and so you
You got to thinking there was no way out
You started sinking and it pulled you down
It may be tough you've got to get back up

Because you know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
You can count on me
'Cause I will carry you 'til you carry on

Anytime you need someone
Somebody strong to lean on
Well you can count on me to hold you 'til the healing is done
And every time you fall apart
Well you can hide here in my arms
And you can count on me to hold you 'til that feeling is gone

I wonder why nobody's waiting on you
I'd like to be the one to pull you through your darkest times
I'd love to be the light that finds you
I see a silver lining on your cloud
I'll pick you up whenever you fall down
Just take my hand and I will help you stand
You might also like
Because you know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
You can count on me
'Cause I will carry you 'til you carry on

Anytime you need someone
Somebody strong to lean on
Well you can count on me to hold you 'til the healing is done
And every time you fall apart
Well you can hide here in my arms
And you can count on me to hold you 'til that feeling is

Gone so you can live today
Say so long to yesterday
Keep on counting on me
To carry you 'til you carry on
Carry on

You know that life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
You can count on me 'cause I will carry you 'til you carry on
Anytime you need someone
Somebody strong to lean on
Well you can count on me to hold you 'til that healing is done
And every time you fall apart
Well you can hide here in my arms
And you can count on me to hold you 'til that feeling is gone

Remember life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
That you can count on me to hold you 'til that feeling is gone
Remember life ain't over yet
I'm here for you so don't forget
