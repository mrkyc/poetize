All work and no play makes another dull day
You're a car crash that's been going on for a year
You're a hurricane that hits when the skies should be clear
I, I got a gun and I'm into the weeds
You're everyone's fool and you're nobody's queen
A royal flush, turn your suicide king
You know we go together like cigarettes and gasoline
There's no reason to fight
You know you may be right
You know you may be right
Tell yourself another good lie
You keep singing your song
You know you may be wrong
You know you may be wrong
There's a lot to be said for goodbye
Give me one good reason why you think we're okay
Give you another ten thousand why I'm walking away
I'm tired of fighting and sick of the pain
Tired of the talking when you're acting insane
And here we are at the end of the day
We go together like kids and cocaine

You know you may be right
You know you may be right
Tell yourself another good lie
You keep singing your song
You know you may be wrong
You know you may be wrong
There's a lot to be said for goodbye
All work and no play makes another dull day
All work and no play makes another dull day
All work and no play makes another dull day
All work and no play (It's time to say goodbye) makes another dull day
There's no reason to fight
You know you may be right
You know you may be right
Tell yourself another good lie
You keep singing your song
You know you may be wrong
You know you may be wrong
There's a lot to be said for goodbye
Said for goodbye
There's a lot to be said goodbye
