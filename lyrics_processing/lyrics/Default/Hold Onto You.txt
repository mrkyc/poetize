Do you remember how it felt in the sunlight?
You're still smiling through the pain you're hiding in
But everyone can see that something's just not right
You've been waiting for so long, so long
You've been looking for some way to hold on
I know you feel so far away
So far away from better days
As you look
For a way out
I'll hold onto you
And when it gets too hard to take
I'll be the light that leads the way
As you look
For a way out
I'll hold onto you
I'll hold onto you
You tell yourself that you'll make it right someday
You're getting way too good at living your own lies
Been broken down
But believe somehow
That the sun can still burn through the clouds in your eyes

You've been looking for some way to hold on
I know you feel so far away
So far away from better days
As you look
For a way out
I'll hold onto you
And when it gets too hard to take
I'll be the light that leads the way
As you look
For a way out
I'll hold onto you
I'll hold onto you
Take one step
Just one step forward
One step
One step
I know you feel so far away
So far away from better days
As you look
For a way out
I'll hold onto you
When it gets too hard to take
I'll be the light that leads the way
As you look
For a way out
I'll hold onto you
I know you feel so far away
So far away from better days
As you look
For a way out
I'll hold onto you
When it gets too hard to take
I'll be the light that leads the way
As you look
For a way out
I'll hold onto you
