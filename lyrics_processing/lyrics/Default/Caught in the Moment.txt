Well I was waiting for you
Just don't think I ever knew
I was out there all alone
Now every breath I breathe for you
If you fall, know you can
Just reach out and take my hand
Give to me the weight of your world
I'd carry it for you

Some things just have to stall
Don't ever say it's your fault

My son, it's not what I wanted, I got tired of falling
This road that I'm running, it will lead me back to you
Time I thought that was stolen, got caught in a moment
The moment brought me you

I didn't want you to see
What was never meant to be
These old mistakes I can't erase
Won't come between you and me
You might also likeI know I'm sometimes hard to find
I'm never leaving you behind
I may be miles away but you should know
You're always on my mind

Some things just have to stall
Don't ever say it's your fault

My son, it's not what I wanted, I got tired of falling
This road that I'm running it will lead me back to you
Time I thought that was stolen, got caught in a moment
The moment brought me you, the moment brought me

Laughter in the storm, but a love that can't be torn
And it all started with you
And I see you're the reason I'm here, the reason's so clear
It's the moment of truth, this moment brought me you
I got caught in a moment
The moment brought me you, the moment brought me you

My son, it's not what I wanted, I got tired of falling
This road that I'm running it will lead me back to you
Time I thought that was stolen, got caught in a moment
The moment brought me you, the moment brought me
My son, it's not what I wanted, I got tired of falling
The moment brought me you, the moment brought me you
Time I thought that was stolen, got caught in a moment
