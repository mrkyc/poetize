Pressure is presently pushing down on me
The first time it starts with just you and I
Repeating myself but you don't hear me
I can see what you see
But is it worth it to me?
The same old conversation
Over and over and over
I'm just sick and tired
Of all those lies you tell me
You say those same things to me
Over and over and over
It's safe to say you surprise
I see right through you this time
But I keep telling you
It's over, it's over, it's over
You've taken these things that belong to me
Twisted so tightly and torn so carefully
The last time it ends with just you and I
Alone in a room with these torn bed sheets
I can see what you see
And it ain't worth it to me
The same old conversation
Over and over and over
You might also likeI'm just sick and tired
Of all those lies you tell me
You say those same things to me
Over and over and over
It's safe to say you surprise
I see right through you this time
But I keep telling you
It's over, it's over, it's over
You swore I'd regret it
Now thanks to you I can't forget it
Cost of this constant battle
Won't even miss you at all
Free from this life that you call...
I'm just sick and tired
Of all those lies you tell me
You say those same things to me
Over and over and over
It's safe to say you surprise
I see right through you this time
But I keep telling you
It's over, it's over, it's over
I'm just sick and tired
Of all those lies you tell me
You say those same things to me
Over and over and over
It's safe to say you surprise
I see right through you this time
But I keep telling you
