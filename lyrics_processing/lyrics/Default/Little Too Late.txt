Maybe I missed you
Maybe it's true
Maybe I didn't do enough to
Hold onto you
Maybe you'll think back
On the good times we had
Maybe one day this feeling won't
Remind me of you

It took some time now I know
It's a little too late
I'm in this world all alone
And now I see it's over out of time

I wish I never said goodbye
All the times that I never tried
I couldn't find your love when I lost my way
But as time went on and on
I denied we were meant to be
And now I'm dying 'cause I couldn't see
I threw it away
Now it's a little too late
You might also like
It should have been easy
It seemed so hard
I could never say that we were
Better apart
I should have been the one to hold you
I should have been the one you run to
Turned around just in time to
See a fading memory of you

It took some time now I know
It's a little too late
I'm in this world all alone
And now I see it's over out of time

I wish I never said goodbye
All the times that I never tried
I couldn't find your love when I lost my way
But as time went on and on
I denied we were meant to be
And now I'm dying 'cause I couldn't see
I threw it away
Now it's a little too late
I remember when I said goodbye
I can't forget the tears that you cried
I pretended that I was over you
I let you go and I don't know why

You took some time now I know

I wish I never said goodbye
All the times that I never tried
I couldn't find your love when I lost my way
But as time went on and on
I denied we were meant to be
And now I'm dying 'cause I couldn't see
I threw it away
Now it's a little too late

(Too little, too late, too late)
It's a little too late
(Too little, too late, too late)
It's a little too late
(Too little, too late, too late)
