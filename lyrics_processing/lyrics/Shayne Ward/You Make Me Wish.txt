I noticed you, noticed you walking through the door, yeah
The sexiest finest thing dancing on the floor, yeah
You move your body like I've never seen before, yeah
You make me wish that I didn't have a girlfriend
It crazy, so crazy, the way your body's shaking
I almost feel guilty picturing you get naked
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you know how to work it
You make me wish that I didn't have a girlfriend

I love my girl, I love my girl but come on
You're hotter than an oven turned on
The things I wanna do with you are so wrong
Wish I could stay but I should go home

(Dance with me)
Do you wanna dance with me girl, just for a little while?
(Dance with me)
Don't you wanna dance with me, girl, girl, girl?
