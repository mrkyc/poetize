You said, goodbye, I fell apart, I fell from all we had
To I never knew, I needed you so bad
You need to let things go, I know you told me so
I've been through Hell to break the spell
Why did I ever let you slip away?
Can't stand another day without you
Without the feeling, I once knew

I cry silently
I cry inside of me
I cry hopelessly
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
(I cry)
'Cause you're not here with me
'Cause I'm lonely as can be
(I cry hopelessly)
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again

If you could see me now
You would know just how
How hard I try
Not to wonder why
I wish, I could believe in something new
Oh please, somebody tell me it's not true
(Oh, girl)
I'll never be over you
Why did I ever let you slip away?
Can't stand another day without you
Without the feeling, I once knew
You might also like
I cry silently
I cry inside of me
I cry hopelessly
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again
(I cry)
'Cause you're not here with me
'Cause I'm lonely as can be, yeah
(I cry hopelessly)
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again, yeah

If I could have you back tomorrow
If I could lose the pain and sorrow
I would do just anything
To make you see, still love me
Ohh
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love again

I cry silently
I cry inside of me
I cry hopelessly
'Cause I'll never no, no never breathe your love again
(I cry)
'Cause you're not here with me
(I cry)
'Cause I'm lonely as can be, yeah
(I cry)
'Cause I know I'll never breathe your love
(No I'll never)
