It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable, how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know
If you just don't know how I feel
Then let me show you that now I'm for real
If all the things in time, time will reveal, yeah

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one

So incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable, for us to be apart
Never would've made it very far
Cause you know you got the keys to my heart

Cause one, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one
You might also like
Say farewell to the dark of night
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child
Whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line
Just in the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
