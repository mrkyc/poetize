These four walls closing more every day
I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
I'm crying inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say?
How could I let my angel get away?
Now my world is just a tumbling down
I can see it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm trembling inside and nobody knows it but me, yeah
I lie awake, it's a quarter past three
I'm screaming at night if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah, my heart is calling you and nobody knows it but me
How blue could I get? You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be loving you still
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
Tomorrow morning I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, wherever you might go
And I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me
I said when the nights are lonely
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinking about the love that we had
