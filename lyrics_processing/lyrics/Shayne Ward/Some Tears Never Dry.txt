Baby, some tears never dry

I used to think that we could work it out
I used to think that if we had some problems
I always thought if there was love around
No matter what, I always thought we'll solvin'
Now, everyday we're in an argument
It's like a circle that don't ever end
We're keepin' secrets and we're tellin' lies
Whatever's wrong, let's make it right 'cause I

I don't wanna say goodbye
'Cause my heart couldn't take it
Baby, give me one more try
I don't wanna have to cry
'Cause I know if we lose it
Baby, some tears never dry
Baby, some tears never dry

Now, what happened to our movie nights?
Girl, I thought that we would always have them
I used to make you laugh like all the time
Now, I don't ever, we got a problem
Lately, you never ask about my day
And on the phone we got nothing to say
I get the feeling something's going on
Whatever's wrong, let's make it right 'cause I
You might also like
I don't wanna say goodbye
'Cause my heart couldn't take it
Baby, give me one more try
I don't wanna have to cry
'Cause I know if we lose it
Baby, some tears never dry
Baby, some tears never dry

Let's talk about
A way that we can work it out
Girl, we're runnin' outta time
And the thought of a break up is tearing me up inside
We can work it out, if we talk about it
We can show the world that you and I are fighting for it
We'll get through the worst and I know we'll make it
If we stay together we'll make it through alive

I don't wanna say goodbye
'Cause my heart couldn't take it
Baby, give me one more try
I don't wanna have to cry
'Cause I know if we lose it
Baby, some tears never dry
I don't wanna say goodbye
'Cause my heart couldn't take it
Baby, give me one more try
I don't wanna have to cry
'Cause I know if we lose it
Baby, some tears never dry
Baby, some tears never dry
