Let's, let's go ahead now
Girl, let's go ahead now
Go ahead now, go ahead now
I know that you got a boyfriend
Who's waiting for ya
But I don't care about your boyfriend
Keep on waiting for ya
I wonder if everything on you girl
Is really real now
Checking you out, checking you out
Now I figured it out, figured it out
I wish I could hypnotize ya
Get in your head now
I won't ever snap my fingers
And let you back out
All I'm about, all I'm about
Can you figure it out, figure it out
Tell me when you wanna go
I just can't wait not another day
Girl say yes tonight
Say what you want but it's me you like
And I know what's been on your mind
My body over your body
Your body over my body
I always wanted somebody
Someone like you
Now that I gotta taste the heaven
I wanna go back
Know that the chance that I've been given
Can no one top that
Feel it we were meant to be together
Don't keep me from that
I got it knocked out, got it knocked out
You're all I'm thinking about, thinking about
I wish I could hypnotize ya
Get in your head now
I won't ever snap my fingers
And let you back out
All I'm about, all I'm about
Can you figure it out, figure it out
That's all I'm waiting for
Hey
I just can't wait not another day
Girl say yes tonight
Say what you want but it's me you like
And I know what's been on your mind
My body over your body
Your body over my body
I always wanted somebody
Someone like you
Hey
You say that you got a man and I wonder why
What you're doing here spending all your time
Baby one can see that you live a life
What you're meant to do to your man tonight
He'll never gonna love you more than I
Looking for the one that I gotta find
That I gotta find
I just can't wait not another day
Girl say yes tonight
Say what you want but it's me you like
And I know what's been on your mind
My body over your body
Your body over my body
I always wanted somebody
Someone like you
Girl, let's go ahead now
Let's, let's go ahead now
Girl, let's go ahead now
Go ahead now, go ahead now
Girl, let's go ahead now
Let's, let's go ahead now
Girl, let's go ahead now
