Sweeter than you, sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover
More precious than you, more precious than you
Girl, you are
Close to me, you're like my mother
Close to me, you're like my father
Close to me, you're like my sister
Close to me, you're like my brother
You are the only one
You're my everything
And for you this song I sing
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
Said I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of, I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug
I really love you so much, baby
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me
You might also likeYou're all that I ever know
When you smile on my face all I see is a glow
You turn my life around
You picked me up when I was down
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
All my life I prayed for someone like you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
I will never find another lover
