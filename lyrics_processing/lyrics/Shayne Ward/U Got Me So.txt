Excuse me girl, can I talk to you
Maybe get you name and your number too
I don't mean to be blunt, but baby
I know that I've got the thing you need
Say what you want and I can make sure
You get it on the count of three
We can move slow or we can move fast
To get to it right away
You must've known with a body like that
I'd go insane

You got me so, so hooked on
Every little thing you do
Has got me so, so turned on
Let me take a look at you
Without a doubt, I'm higher now
Girl, I'm higher now
Every little thing about you
Has got me so

Girl, you got me so
Got me hooked on you
And I'm so turned on by the things you do
It's okay to be shy but don't you deny
That I got that thing you need
I'll say what I want and you can make sure
I get it on the count of three
A pretty face on a body like that
Don't come along every day
Maybe I'm over confident
You might also like
But you'll say my name, you got me so
Say my name
You got me so, so hooked on
Every little thing you do
Has got me so, so turned on
Let me take a look at you
Without a doubt, I'm higher now
Girl, I'm higher now
Every little thing about you
Has got me so

I can tell I'm good for you
I can tell you see it too
When you wanna leave tonight
Should we go to yours or mine

You got me so

You got me so, so hooked on
Every little thing you do
Has got me so, so turned on
Let me take a look at you
Without a doubt, I'm higher now
Every little thing about you
Has got me so
You got me so, so hooked on
Every little thing you do
Has got me so, so turned on
Let me take a look at you
Without a doubt, I'm higher now
Girl, I'm higher now
Every little thing about you
