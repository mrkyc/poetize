Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free
You got me trippin'
And it feels like a shock to my system
Didn't think it existed
And now I know that it's true, yes, I do
And now I'm on a mission
Because you made me see
That it's not impossible
That someone just like you
Could be with me, yes, you could

Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free
It's like you're out of my league
And though I'm trying to keep my cool
It's hard you see when you're next to me
(When you're next to me, baby)

It was you that was missing
I never knew the truth 'til my heart told me
That something was different
So I listened for the first time, yes, I did
It's a new kind of feeling
You take me to a place that I ain't been
When you touch me, it's magic
When you touch me, yes, it is
You might also like
Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free
It's like you're out of my league
And though I'm trying to keep my cool
It's hard you see when you're next to me, baby
Next to me, baby, come on

Feels like the first time
Every time that you look at me
And I have to try and get a grip on reality
People say this and they say that
But baby, it's hard to see
When you're next to me, baby, come on
 X2
Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free
It's like you're out of my league
And though I'm trying to keep my cool
It's hard you see when you're next to me, baby
