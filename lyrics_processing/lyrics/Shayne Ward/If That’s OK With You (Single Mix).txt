I love the way that you look without your make up
I had a girl before we met but we broke up
Theres something 'bout you that make me wanna step up
Step up and be with you, if thats ok with you
Well keep the neighbors awake too late, too late
'Cuz Im gonna make you feel so good
Thats how I see it happening
Yeah, well keep the neighbors awake too late, too late
'Cuz baby, I wanna step up and be with you
If thats ok with you
Im gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth
Im gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
Im gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If thats ok with you, if thats ok with you
I wanna keep your toothbrush at my apartment
Make a second set of keys and ask you to move in
Im not crazy, I know what Im getting myself in
I wanna live with you, if thats ok with you
Im gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth
Im gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
Im gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If thats ok with you, if thats ok with you
Im gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth
Im gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
Im gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If thats ok with you, if thats ok with you
If thats ok with you, if thats ok with you
Well keep the neighbors awake too late, too late
I wanna love you this way, that way, this way
Well keep the neighbors awake too late, too late
I wanna love you this way, that way, this way
Im gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth
Im gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
Im gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If thats ok with you, if thats ok with you
Im gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth
Im gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
Im gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If thats ok with you, if thats ok with you
If thats ok with you, if thats ok with you
If thats ok with you, if thats ok with you
