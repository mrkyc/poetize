You left your mark, hope it never fades
But don't stop now, take me all the way
This is close to close, this is close to close
They say love just isn't worth it
I say you gotta put the work in
That way you're always gonna get what you give
This is close to close, this is close to close
You're this close
So stay right here and don't hold back
I'm into what you're doing, do it just like that
It's me and you, forget the world
Just do what you're doing
Because you're this close to close
This is close to close, this is close to close
So don't stop now, take my breath away
Don't let your heart try to play it safe
This is close to close, this is close to close
You're this close
Last time love just wasn't working
This time I plan to put to the work in
That way I'm always gonna get what I give
This is close to close, you're this close, oh
So stay right here and don't hold back
I'm into what you're doing, do it just like that
It's me and you, forget the world
Just say what you're saying
'Cause it's the best thing that I've heard
You don't know how far you've come
Negotiation's over, let's just get it done
So stay with me and don't let go
Just do what you're doing
Because you're this close to close
This is close to close, this is close to close
It's been a while since I've been this way
You left your mark, hope it never fades
But don't stop now, take me all the way
Into your heart, baby, don't stop me falling
Stay right here and don't hold back
I'm into what you're doing, do it just like that
It's me and you, forget the world
Just say what you're saying
'Cause it's the best thing that I've heard
You don't know how far you've come
Negotiation's over, let's just get it done
So stay with me and don't let go
Just do what you're doing
