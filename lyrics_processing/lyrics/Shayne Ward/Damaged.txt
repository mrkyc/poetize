Remember those photographs
We took on that boat in Spain
I took 'em down and ripped 'em up
And threw them all away
Remember on the back of one
You wrote we were meant to be
That doesn't really matter now
'Cause you don't mean a thing to me

Baby, you should've told me
Told me from the start
I thought that I was your only
Till you put me on the shelf and
Found somebody else

I never thought that you would ever do that
Everything we had is gone
You said you love me, said you'll never leave
Maybe I just heard you wrong
'Cause I'm damaged, I'm damaged
Don't know what to do, baby
I'm damaged, so, so damaged
Because of you
You might also like
Got rid of those clothes you left
Like you got rid of my dreams
I don't wanna be reminded of
All of the memories
I used to have the tickets
I saved from our very first date
But it don't really matter now
'Cause you threw our love away

Baby, you should've told me
Because now I'm torn apart
I thought that I was your only
Till you put me on the shelf and
Found somebody else

I never thought that you would ever do that
Everything we had is gone
You said you love me, said you'll never leave
Maybe I just heard you wrong
'Cause I'm damaged, I'm damaged
Don't know what to do, baby
I'm damaged, I'm so, so damaged
Because of you
It's almost like you would never hear
I almost feel like I don't care, girl
I've almost got rid of all the pain
The only thing I've left to say
Is how could you leave me so damaged
Damaged, oh no no no no

I never thought, never thought that you'd do that
Everything is gone
You said you love me, you said you'll never leave
Maybe I just heard you wrong
 X2
I never thought that you would ever do that
Everything we had is gone
You said you love me, said you'll never leave
Maybe I just heard you wrong
'Cause I'm damaged, I'm damaged
Don't know what to do, baby
I'm damaged, I'm so, so damaged
