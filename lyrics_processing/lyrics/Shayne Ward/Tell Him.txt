I woke up this morning, you know
I had a shocker
See it finally hit me how much I truly love ya
Stumbling out of bed
I grabbed my phone and called ya
But you were MIA so I decided to stay right here
Picked up a pen before I knew I had it
Hand written letter to you with some Vivaldi magic
See every love before this I had was truly tragic
That's why 'm happy to say

Hey, I think it's time you be telling your boyfriend
Exactly what you and I've been doing
Tell him, the end
Don't know how much more I can take
Hey, now's the time to be telling your boyfriend
About all of the time we're spending
Tell him, the end
Baby hey, hey, hey, hey

Now running, catching a cab 'cause I just have to see ya
I tell the driver to drive like it's gon' break his meter
(I tell him don't stop)
Before I go any further, I gotta tell you
I ain't never acted quite like this
You done a number on me
I swear you're everything I ever wanted
I've got so much love to give, you don't understand
Now I'm right outside your door
Rode up forty floors, gotta hold you, touch you

Hey, I think it's time you be telling your boyfriend
Exactly what you and I've been doing
Tell him, the end
Don't know how much more I can take
Hey, now's the time to be telling your boyfriend
About all of the time we're spending
Tell him, the end
Baby hey, hey, hey, hey

It's what you do, you're killing me
I can feel there's something different
How you make me feel no accident
I found you girl
So please, this should come as no surprise

Hey, I think it's time you be telling your boyfriend
Exactly what you and I've been doing
Tell him, the End
Don't know how much more I can take
Hey, now's the time to be telling your boyfriend
About all of the time we're spending
Tell him, the end
Baby hey, hey, hey, hey
Something you should know
'Cause it's killing me
Girl are you listening
Go on and tell him
