I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops
You're my one and only baby
Come on
Listen girl, there's a lot of things I need to tell you
And it's coming from my heart cause I can't seem to live without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sit with me and let me explain my situation
I need to put it into words, but you gotta have a little patience
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your face should be the first thing that I see in the morning
Cause I wanna be by your side bursting with pride for all to see
I wanna shout out in the street
So everyone will see
That I'm so proud of you
We'd go walking hand in hand
Leaving footprints in the sand
Like lovers do
We can join our hearts together
Always and forever
I'm so proud of you
Listen girl, you know I'm pretty hot on devotion
I mean everything I say, I'm not another fish in the ocean
Oh, oh, oh, oh
