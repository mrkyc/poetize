Must be a reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
And I
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you
This started in my mind
Not limited by where I'm at in my life
Only I can ever change it up
Kinda stuck but I make my luck
And I know I gotta take control
I don't wanna ever lean on you
You're defined by what you own
But my soul is rich on its own
I don't ever wanna bow down a lot
All I wanna do is call the shot
Ain't nobody got me on speed dial
In my head I'm ahead by a mile
Moving on to bigger, better things
In my brain I'm the only king
Don't need you
That's how I get through
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
And I
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you
Yeah, of you, yeah, of you
Yeah, of, yeah

Only I can ever right my wrong
I don't jump when you hit the gong
And in my mind I design how long
Don't you start thinking I'm working for you?
Deep in my heart yo I do what I do
Gotta 'cause I gotta eat when I'm free
Feeling the heat underneath my feet
Moving on to bigger, better things
In my brain I'm the only king
Don't need you
That's how I get through
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
And I
Must be a reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be a reason why I'm making examples of you
Yeah, of you, yeah, of you
