I represent my nigaa Myze
Myze, we represent my nigaa Myze
Myze, from New Jersey we rep represent Myze
Myze, uhhh
Uhh
Myze Myze, uhh...uhh!
Uhh Myze Myze!..uhhh, uhh..
Damn if I had dreams, it would've been hype as shit
But damn...curls 

I gotta get out man I gotta get out man
I know I'm gone make it man I'm educated man
I'm lightly faded this wine is outdated
I stick to the liquor that cause that hit you quicker
They don't really know all of ya problems man
But they so proclaim they gone solve em man
They, they, they ain't even doing it
Hey, hey, Watch em ruin it they ruin it
Walk up into the room like who is this, newest-ness
Turn the volume up man it's Myze
That'll be better man it time to tell em all of the tricks of the trade
Get up out that life that turned you slave
So I turn the page, this a new book
Medusa past , I can't look I won't look
I won't be shook and i stand all alone
Grew up in a place where house wasn't home
If it wasn't bout sports I did not get support
And this music shit wasn't even last resort
I just did it cause I liked man I wasn't even good
Niggas wouldn't listen cause I wasn't even hood
They put me to the side until I started getting older
As I got older my shoulder got colder
As I got older my friend circle shrunk
Couldn't fuck around, with them fuck arounds..
Can't even amount to what I'm gonna be
All my future visions man y'all wanna see
Everything I'm gonna be y'all wanna be y'all boring me
Y'all have no originality
All this pain I carry man it's a heavy load
But nobody else stronger enough to hold a piece
They holding me back, but they never ever ever had my back
You might also like
I stay, I stay, roaming the city 
Home is where the heart is but my heart isn't with me
They say you grow'd up
Now look times changed
Still don't know love
So what is love
So what is
Another year, same me
Another year, same me
Another year, same me
Another year, same me, nobody else

Whole life like I'm stuck in a cavern
Little did they know that this cavern has shattered
Can't see it up close so it really don't matter
Should I piss life away and get a new bladder
All these options these options these options
All of these options are up for adoption
Golden child getting treated like dirt
Just keep a smile so they think I don't hurt
Inside I hurt, outside tough steel
This stainless man I made it
I made me nigga self
All these beats I made and I don't get paid
Lived a dirty life then I cleaned it up self maid
Got a girl I don't need self-laid
Whole life crazy
Whole life crazy
Dad kicked me out but my mom let me back in
A day never passed that he ever let me forget
Man how could I forget
Had food on the table but I couldn't fork it
Had me scared to eat
Had me scared to sleep
But I never left the kitchen cause I always took the heat
Always took the heat
Still a role model, selfie on the road model
Had low support and I still do
Like saying "damn your shit is good" is gonna kill you
But fuck all that shit don't need you on my dick
Ain't no room anyways, my dick big don't mistake
Anyways man back to the story
Whole life way short of the glory
20 years and I still ain't shit
20 years wishing I was still a kid
I'm a kid at heart man it seems like I gotta be
Momma said she sees my future man I wanna see
Man I wanna see
Man I wanna see

Another year, same me
Another year, same me
Another year, same me
Another year, same me, nobody else


Friend: Bruh, let's go back to the party!!
