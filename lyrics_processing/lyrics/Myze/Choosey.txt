You said you'd never drink
Now you drinking straight from the bottle
You used to make fun of
Now you a wannabe model
Had dreams of coasting
Now you just smoking
How'd you stoop so low
Used to not care what they think
Now you crave the attention
You used to be care free
Now you begging for the permission
Had dreams of Forbes listing
Now all your choices so twisted
How'd you lose control
It's almost like you do it on purpose
But then again you're losing your purpose
Tell me why making choices makes you nervous
You hiding your old flames in a furnace
Oh, I bet you didn't know I've been observant
Actions no long so holy tell me who your serving
Even when it's cold out you'd rather be shirtless
Are you sure of this
Are you sure of this, cause
You might also like

First get your cred up
Then you'll get your bred
Quit the second guessing
Overcome the lessons
So many options all you do with them is tango
First get your cred up
Then you'll get your bred
Quit the second guessing
Overcome the lessons
So many options all you do with them is tango

Enough with the one day you'll choose me
And then the next day you just can't wait to lose me
Un-diagnosed psycho
Choosey choosey choosey cycle
My time's not the only one wasted
It's your time, it's your time
My time's not the only one wasted
It's your time, it's your time
