Have we met before?
I guess not because I am not forgetful
You would know me even if we never really met
My aura in the room is one you can't even forget
I hear them say I'm different
But I'm just trying to hear Myze
You should know can't nobody compete
Don't care about positioning yo
You can have the window seat
As long as I'm the captaim (ooh)
You better buckle up
It's a puzzle how I juggle all these women and attention
And I barely even mention how I struggled in the rubble
To get money in the duffle and still shuffled all my hustles
And yet you worried 'bout Metro
When it's Myze who do not trust you
Can't you see me
Yeah you see me
You imitating my reflection
The difference between you and Myze is
You can't gain this affection
Ain't no love and affection ever pushed in your direction
Mama said boy don't forget that your complexion is a blessing
Now I'm noticing the lighter ones are tanning
And they stressing, cause
You might also like
If you've ever met me
Congratulations cause you've met me
You'll never forget me
You'll never forget me I'm not forgetful
I'm not forgetful
You'll never forget me I'm not forgetful
I'm not forgetful

Did you notice me?
That's a trick question I know you notice me
Elephant in the room I will always be
So Come & Talk to Me on some Jodeci
You think the attention going to ruin me
It's hard to stay the same when your closest one's change
Who now remain without a name
Whose to blame
Maybe I seemed lame with no money to my name
Use to ask me to go out and now it's hard to go back home
Well at least that's how it was back when
I was crossing state to state to state
Almost every single day
But boy it paid to get here to this day
Practiced at my passions on some 2-a-days
I would choose the same path every day (day)
Currently, slowly building up my currency
Every key I touch opens a new door
It's easy to complain when you go against the grain
But at least you making bread in a new store
If you've ever met me
Congratulations cause you've met me
You'll never forget me
You'll never forget me I'm not forgetful
I'm not forgetful
You'll never forget me I'm not forgetful
I'm not forgetful

Touched down in a new town
Got to learn faces quickly
So no one forgets me
I'm glad I'm not impatient
I'm overtime embracing
Putting in work for everything that I'm worth
If God gave me brain I should get it too
