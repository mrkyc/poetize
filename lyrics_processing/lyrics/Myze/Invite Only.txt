Yeah, yeah

This is you
This is yo moment of truth, be the vehicle
You get this offer one night only
If we hit it off, won't tell my homies
You, oh, you got something different
The connection a lovely epiphany
Seems these the days that were sent for me
I feel all the tension and energy
Lately I'm acting professional
I'll no longer hold back on testosterone
See, I got a plan
One day you'll all understand
Knew it when I whipped the van
They boo'ed it when I passed on zans
Oh yeah, and I'll clean my own ceiling fan
Courtesy to K Dot, I'll be my own fan
But I won't be alone in the end, hmm

My love, my love is invite only, hmm
My love, my love is invite only, hmm
My love, my love is invite only
My love, my love is invite only, yeah

I been showing love with a poker face
Sipping liquor with some lemonade
How the world 'gon get saved
When I turned Sampson, got my beard shaved
Pulled up late, ain't no mistake
We just lost faith in our damn selves
Why y y y answer the call from a damsel
Cut my beard, shed no tear like I'm Denzel, twe-
Twenty-Third century man with no damn help, hmm
Blasting through your speakers, even low vol I'll be heard
You got me wanting to break the curse

My love, my love is invite only, hmm
My love, my love is invite only, hmm
My love, my love is invite only
My love, my love is invite only, yeah

I been showing love with a poker face
Sipping liquor with some lemonade
How the world 'gon get saved
When I turned Sampson, got my beard shaved
Pulled up late, ain't no mistake
