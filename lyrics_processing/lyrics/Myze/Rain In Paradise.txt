I don't mean to sell my self short
Seems to be the only thing I've done lately
It's hard to know your worth
If you don't hear it on the daily
At least it seems that way to most
I thank God I'm not like most
It's always quieter when you have nothing to boast
No bragging
'Mo lagging
You not up to speed
No silence
'Mo violence
Nobody riding with me even in a 2-seater
When they saying "Legend tells"
They repeat the things I'm telling you
I ain't got enough soul to be selling you
Reflect on all the moments that's compelling you

It's weird like rain in the sun (x5)
I know there's Rain In Paradise (x3)
It's weird like rain in the sun
I know there's Rain In Paradise

Why is it me that you come to for motivation
What makes you think I don't need motivation
It's not swallow pride but I never ask for help
Because when I ask for help I never get it
Don't waste apologetic confessions
There's many lessons in rejection
Please don't wait til my money up scales
And my songs cause hell
That won't end well for you
I swear to you
I swear it's true
Tell me what you're afraid of
What mistakes did you make
Did you break a heart of gold
How many friends did you replace
Success is bittersweet
With no one to share it with
I'm the one to share it with
But nobody ever shares anything with me
Unless I'm the 2nd option
No longer will I be a 2nd option
No longer will I be a 2nd option
'Cause it's weird like rain in the sun
You might also like
It's weird like rain in the sun (x5)
I know there's Rain In Paradise (x3)
It's weird like rain in the sun
I know there's Rain In Paradise


I don't need no convincing
I've seen it with my eyes
I know there's Rain In Paradise (x3)

Rain (x6)
