It must be your birthday
Tonight you're the DJ
Pick out yo playlist
Every song we playing
Don't matter the tempo everybody moving
Don't matter the tempo everybody moving
I know you thinking I'm nice
Maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're right
No matter what you say I'm feeling your vibe
It must be mine 'cause I'm feeling your vibe

Oh , I'm feeling your vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe
Oh, I'm feeling your vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe
Hey DJ (hey), Can I request a song for you
You, you ,you
Here it go , this song here is for you
Oh, this is for you
You should know I'm doing this for you
Even making things more complicated
Never had somebody like me baby
Never had somebody with these eyes
Never had a man full of surprises
All you know is lies in disguises
I'm just gonna be straight up with you

Oh, I need a 2nd night
Night, night, night
Oh, I didn't get to say goodbye
Bye, bye, bye
I know you listening, so this isn't goodbye
This isn't goodbye
I know you're listening so this isn't goodbye
This isn't goodbye
Never good at making the first move
Don't want you feeling uncomfortable
Because the more you get comfortable
There's more you're willing to tryout
You start doing extra things like this your tryout
Tryout, tryout
I done walked them cold streets in the DMV
But there's no streets like my streets back in Tennessee
My city's skin color same as Hennessy
Oh the streets need peace and the sheets need freaks
The streets, the streets, the streets
The streets need peace
Peace, peace, peace
And the sheets, the sheets, the sheets
The sheets need freaks
Freaks, freaks ,freaks
I know you thinking I'm nice
Maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're right
No matter what you say I'm feeling your vibe
It must be mine 'cause I'm feeling your vibe
I'm feeling your vibe
Your vibe
I'm feeling your vibe
Your vibe
I'm feeling your vibe
Your vibe

Your vibe

I know you feel the vibe
