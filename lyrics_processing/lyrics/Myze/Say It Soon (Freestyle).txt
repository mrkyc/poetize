All my homies just want me to get to the top
So they can chill with girls and get a little top
I'm talking model chicks
But model chicks are kinda right
If you live the diamond life
They act like they vagina like
Not even in the slightest light
The images inside my head
It sad the people that I'm chilling with are losing they 'cred
I mean they acting like they down
But when I'm needing 'em most they never around
So many fish in the sea man I almost drowned
Fish in the sea
Listen clearly I don't even know why I am telling this
2 years ago I was a rock bottom specialist
D-List celebrity , ain't that a bitch
Long ways away from a hometown hero
Fan count zero doubt percent 100
Gimme like 2 more years then you destroying my dick

So many fish in the sea man I almost drowned
Fish in the sea
I Almost drowned
You might also likeIf you keep hating on me go ahead and kiss me
My ass specifically
When I ask specifically you know shit gets done
Ain't no words undone that fly off of your tongue

They want me back to my old ways
But my old ways way back back in the days
Got a past like Medusa man I can't look back
Flipped some pages in a book that I won't look at
I won't flip them pages back neither should you
Cause everything now and next is certainly the truth like
The moments you living are yours
To share a moment is a choice like
So many fish in the sea man I almost drowned
Fish in the sea
What's the reason that we're living
Are we really really happy
If we say that we are
But always steading mapping
All the places that we'll go to
What's the point of living
If we become a legend then we start giving the children
One life that they don't know yet
One life full of regrets
I'm talking 'bout

This, this isn't love (Love)
This isn't love
(Lord) No no no no
This isn't love
This is something different (x3)
