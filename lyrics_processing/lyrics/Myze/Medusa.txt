(No no no)
All of my actions accounted for
(x4)

I'm flicking the cig' while she's kissing my neck
It's really not working, move on to the next
Toyota Camry, I wanted the Lex
I got options
My good lord, I keep 'em open
I got options
Don't look cause she's watching
I'll turn to stone, I'll turn to stone
Before they all leave me alone

I can't stress all this shit enough
Hoes come and go like they forgetting stuff
Conversating about so so
3 years ago she was a hoe ya know
Making flicks on the go with a go pro
Now ya know she now a no go
But wait a minute I heard from a little birdy that she doing the no no
I heard she souled her soul
I heard she get her earnings on a pole
I heard she throw that ass back and forth like a yo-yo
But I'm guessing them rumors
Them shits spread like tumors
But control that shit for it control you
I like the new me better than the old you



11:30 in the morning got no reason to be turnt
But a long weeks struggle man this shit feels like it's earnt
I wet my curly hair then proceed to clean my brother's Mary Jane resin
Solo smoking and this blunt is his 7th
All jokes aside, no more facades
All these niggas talk Versace but they actions are Hurraches
Minus the nike sign they ain't doing shit
Youngest doing and I'm referring to me
People search for the truth and get referred to me
You thought chick was good at 2k? Nah she learned from me
Ion play games yo, I be on some coach shit

She Ask me why I'm frustrated I said (grunts) ahh it's my Testosterone
