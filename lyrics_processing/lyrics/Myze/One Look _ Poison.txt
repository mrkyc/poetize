All she get is one look then it's over
I mean
Shawty been eyeing me all night, it's over
(Repeat)

All she need is one night then it's over
One look then it's over
Look in these eyes girl mesmerize and
Get you wet wet wet baptized
She freaky, too thick for dashiki's
All she got to do is ask for this dick like it's a genie
You you you
Rub rub rub 3 rounds now girl you out of wishes
I'm caramel not chocolate , no Hershey's, no kisses
Now I'm on to the next chick
Please stay out my business
But if you offering that mouth
I won't reject like a dentist
Your oral and aura been giving me life
Your sent and aroma it's matching matching the night
See these eyes on me not meant to have a wife
Cause these eyes see thick chicks girl I can't do right
I'm feeling the feeling like I just chugged the whole bottle
Wait a minute yeah I chugged the whole bottle
The night been going full throttle
Amsterdam to pass the time
2nd bottle 2nd time

Hol' up hol'up hol'up one at a time
If you thinking you know me you out of your mind
Stick to yo grind homie I'll stick to mine
If you interfere mine your chick's mine in due time
Ain't got time to play games
Ain't no time I can waste
Don't bro who you don't know
That's a nigga at your doe
Asking can he get free dough
You gone ask what for like nope nope nope nope
Back to topic baby I must be Medusa
Shake it then look back at me
Don't know what I do to you
What do I do to you
One look girl and I'm moving
One thing I know I ain't ruin you
This liquor just improving you
Take some shots of henny
Oh don't worry we got plenty more
You say you don't want any
You can leave girl I know more for sure
I know more who gonna take it
Later in the room no faking
All she get is one look
Anything after that is off the books
All she get is one
Look (x8) then it's over
Been eyeing like all
Night (x8) it's over

She she she she
Don't know that I'm Poison
(X2)
I'm poison
