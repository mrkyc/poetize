I'm mastering the art of miracles and flawless tragedies
In here I spend every day in captivity
Devoured while the walls grow hands and teeth

I cried and listened to the rain in a rental car
One day, somebody's gonna go and get pushed too far
But now I don't know what to say
Shall I deny my lungs their breathing rights?
So give it up, give it up, don't let your mind slip away
Don't drink, don't get so high
Your beat's too obvious
Not gonna say what you want me to say, I guess you're right
The less you're seen, the less you are
But I don't even care anymore

Anatomy of a ghost, invisible friend
I won't pay for sanity 'cause I don't wanna know
Some things are better left alone
But thanks for your concern and calls

I'd put a bullet in my head if I ever lost you now
Never even owned a bed, just a blood-red couch
You think you're getting the best of me, disarm this smoke alarm
Fuck you, no one is gonna ruin all our fun
All that we want is this temporary release and distraction

Anatomy of a ghost, invisible friend
I won't pay for sanity 'cause I don't wanna know
Some things are better left alone, it seems
(Are you out there?)
I'm not everything you wanted me to be
So I suggest you pray for a
A full recovery, a full recovery

Your words were written in
Your words were written in
Cold blood
Yeah

Even with phantom power and ludicrous speed
I can't run because betrayal won't come from my enemies

Anatomy of a ghost, invisible friend
I won't pay for sanity, so baby, here's a toast
To things much better left alone
It seems I'm not everything you wanted me to be
In a dream, on the way to the hospital, I'll slip away
What's happening to me?
And as you drag the lake and pull me out
Do you feel the shame inside you?
And as my body lays before you now
