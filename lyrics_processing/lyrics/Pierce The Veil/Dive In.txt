Dive in, take a breath
Blow the smoke through the hole in my chest
Still choking on the bed
Found your waste while the ember red
Keeps falling down and burning holes
Until the pillow and the mattress glow
Now I wanna be the tattoo ink
That swims down through the needle in your skin
And I wish I was poisonous
Like a bottomless sound, like a violent drug
Do you remember the knife I kept?
The sharper it got, the more you wanted me to use it
I was lying to you (Oh), but you were lying too
So what's left to do?
What's left to say?
Stop making friends, just us
I'll decompose with you
So light the fuse inside your brain and we
We will detonate (Yeah)

You threw your drink at the wall
It started raining wine and glass so
Stay and warm me with the Gentlemen Jack
Gold locks on the cage, turn your diamond keys
Open the door, you'll see me digging out my getaway
(Away, away, away)
Hang the stars
Who pulled the pin out of my heart?

And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and swim under the ice

And modern anxiety
That motherfucker never rests
Our adrenaline is kickin' in so play the beat faster
Head for the streets, we're the puke and decay
We're only dreaming, what's your problem baby?
Don't mean to break your heart
I'm the new fragrance in fermented jars
In area code six-six-six, oh

And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and learn how to swim underneath the ice

They're everywhere
Nothing can stop them
Nothing

Kill me if I end up like you
And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and swim under the ice
I know that it's not safe here
You did this to yourself but have no fear
