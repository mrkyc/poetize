She sits up high, surrounded by the sun
One million branches and she loves everyone
"Mom and dad, did you search for me?
I've been up here so long, I'm going crazy"

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Three, two, one, where did it go? (Oh)

Now don't be crazy, yes, now, of course you can stay here
Been in a touring band for going on ten years
"Big deal," she said, "I guess you're official" (Oh)
I only said it 'cause I know what it's like to feel burned out
It gets you down, we've all been there sometimes
But tonight, I'll make you feel beautiful once again

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Three, two, one, where did it go?

If I were you, I'd put that away
See, you're just wasted and thinking 'bout the past again
Darling, you'll be okay
And she said
"If you were me, you'd do the same
'Cause I can't take any more
I'll draw the shades and close the door
Everything's not alright and I would rather"

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
