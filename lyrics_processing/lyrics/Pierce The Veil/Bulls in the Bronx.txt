Do you know
I count your heartbeats before you sleep?
I bite my fingernails to bone
And now I crawl back under the stairwell
To a place I call my home
I really hope you enjoy the show
Because for me, it's just a bad day
You need people like me to feel

Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue

You'll never know
I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight
She said hotels are cheap and there's one down the street
But, oh, don't you threaten me with a good time
Murder the moment, my God, I'm the serpent
I'm sorry, I can't see that you truly loved me

Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue
I've been having this dream that we can fly
So maybe if we never wake up, we can see the sky

Please don't take this out on me
(I don't know how much longer I can take on this earth)
'Cause you're the only thing that's keeping me alive
(I've lost all touch with everything and nothing seems to work)
And I don't want to wait for the down-set date 'cause
(And I'll never be the person that we both want me to be)
I would rather end it all tonight
And if I mean anything to you
(I don't deserve to be alive)
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind

Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue
I've been having this dream that we can fly
So darling, close your eyes

'Cause you're about to miss everything
(About to miss everything)
About to miss everything
