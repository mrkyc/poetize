Surf to me whatever you want
And whenever you're breezing through
Keep tearing my world apart
As we lost the light, wet cash on the bar
She fell victim to a violent wave
And died on the jagged rocks

But don't believe
It's a never-ending summer
'Cause they don't exist
Tied around your tongue in all
The rage and spit
So why am I the one falling apart?

'Cause you don't even know you're an angel
Foolish am I for the times I come and go
These stars defy love, so I close my eyes
And sleep inside your worn-in bed outline

Splash over your body while you drown on me
You ain't seen nothin' yet, enter the galaxy
Of our sober demise
To the young and without type (Oh-oh-oh)
In the morning, hear all the birds sing
It never stops, then, with tears in your eyes
You smiled dressed in Coppertone tan lines
Oh-oh, I hope you don't regret me

But don't believe
It's a never-ending summer
'Cause they don't exist
Tied around your tongue in all
The rage and spit
So why am I the one falling apart?

'Cause you don't even know you're an angel
Foolish am I for the times I come and go
These stars defy love, so I close my eyes
And sleep inside your worn-in bed

And it won't be long 'til we drop this match (Oh-oh-oh)
When I burn to your fingertips, you can throw what's left

So long
Let's go and play those games you like
Let's go and play those games you like
(Oh)

But don't believe
'Cause yesterday I found her with her
Clothes still wet
Crying in the shower on her
Knees, she screamed
"Why the fuck am I falling apart?"
'Cause you don't even know you're an angel
Foolish am I for the times I come and go
These stars defy love, so close my eyes
And sleep inside your worn-in bed

And it woke me up like a heart attack
