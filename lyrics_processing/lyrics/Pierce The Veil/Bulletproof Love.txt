I'll breathe you in with smoke in the backyard light
We used to laugh until we choked, into the wasted nights
It was the best time of my life, but now I sleep alone
So don't, don't, don't wake me up, 'cause my thrill is gone
Say I'm wrong in the sunset turning red behind the smoke
Forever and alone
Yeah

And you've gone and sewn me to this bed
The taste of you and me will never leave my lips again
Under the blinding rain (Blinding rain)
I wanna hold your hand so tight, I'm gonna break my wrists (Break my wrists)
And when the vultures sing tonight, I'm gonna join right in

I'll sing along, (Oh, oh, oh)
Because I don't know any other song, woah, oh, no
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And now there's nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon

This isn't fair (No)
Don't you try to blame this on me
My love for you was bulletproof, but you're the one who shot me
And goddammit, I can barely say your name
So, I'll try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink
Woah, oh
But, don't just say it, you should sing my name
Pretend that it's a song 'cause forever it's yours
And we can sing this on the way home

I'll sing along, (Oh, oh, oh)
'Cause I don't know any other song, woah, oh, no
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
But now there's nothing to do, but tear my voice apart
