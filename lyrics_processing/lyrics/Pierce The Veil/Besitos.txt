You're my favorite explosion
(You know the only real way to cure pain is to add a little more)
(Because everything new distracts the old)

A violin with no hands plays
Symphonies with no words (With no words)
A drowning boy with no voice prays
Someone up there's telling me
"You'd better not get back up"
I spit my heart into this red cup
I'd better pick it back up, it might ruin your night (Ruin your night)
And she said

"Baby, leave the water by the bed for later"
I woke up without a single drop

I told myself
"I'm tired of holding up your backup plans"
Go down your list and be satisfied
If all you have is not enough

(True love comes from more than just the heart)
She said paint a picture on me
Throw your dress up and your heart away
Yeah, I heard what you said (No), a friend of a friend
These strangers at the party never paid
And if that doesn't turn you on
I'll keep talking 'til something does
As we're covered in sand, you roll over and smile (Smile, smile)
See Pierce The Veil LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like
I told myself
"I'm tired of holding up your backup plans"
Go down your list and be satisfied
It's all you have

And until that day (That day)
I'll steal you flowers from the cemetery, red roses
Red rose of the dead
How does it feel to breathe oxygen inside her head?

So say it (Say it, say), say "I'm in love"
'Cause you called me crying (Crying), crying (Crying) from your job
Said you just got fired and you don't have a backup plan
So don't expect me to understand
A diamond bullet and a gun made of gold
She was covered in blood, last seen in San Francisco

Yeah, alright
(We all break down)
Sometimes the bedroom walls become my only friends
But they were there from beginning to end
(There from beginning to end)
I'm tired of holding up your backup plans
Go down your list and be satisfied
It's all you have

You know I've never held a gun in my life
But now I carry one around in case I see you tonight
Bedroom walls, oh, these bedroom walls
Oh, I hate what it tastes like

(Hate)
