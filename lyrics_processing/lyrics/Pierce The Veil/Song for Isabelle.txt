She paints in grey
And she closes her eyes
'Til fireworks and palm trees almost look alike
She looks up to me and whispers
"I won't be here in a year"
So I take the long road
To think and wonder why
I can't sleep with all this sunlight
If there's still evidence of us
Why can't that be enough?

I don't mean to drag you down
You taste just like you always do

Isabelle hides, so I can't find my way
I'd give anything just to surround your dreams
Oh-oh-oh

The envy of the dead
The sound of scissors and sleep
I can't believe you dreamed
And pulled all of your clothes off
You're not supposed to drink
With what's inside your purse
And not expect me not to call, call you out
I'm guiding your chin to my lips
Using only my fingertips

All we have are parking lots and nowhere to go
If you love me, then show me more

Isabelle watches me from far away
I'd give anything just to surround your dreams
I know you like when
The temperature rises to a boiling heat
The chlorine and wine found
He sees through her nightgown
And everything fades away

The stars awake
But we can't see them out, so why pretend?
Is there a train
That travels back to yours at 5 AM
Or are we walking?
Car alarms and leaves that blow
They're calling out our names
But it's gone too far
Your butane mouth
Will spit me into flames
Why!?
Sorry 'bout it, I can't help it
I'm an anarchist in love
And I forgot to call you
I can't break you down while I
Think about honey and the sweet New York sounds

Isabelle hides, so I can't find my way
I'd give anything to carry on, and on and on the same way
Why!?
The temperature rises to this boiling heat
The chlorine and wine found
He sees through her nightgown
As Saturday burns away
Why!?

Back in the days, when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
