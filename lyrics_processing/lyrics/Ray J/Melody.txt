Yeah, oh, oh, melody, get me hot (Uh)

I just wish that I could hold you
While you're slipping through my fingers, as I'm playing the piano
What is that sound it sounds so beautiful
And I just wanna be close to you
Close enough that I can feel you (Baby)
I'm already wondering where you are
And it sounds like it's coming from my guitar

Melody, said that I love you
Melody, said that I adore you
Melody, said that I, I need you (Need you, need you)
You can call me foolish, and I might be, but I'm in love with a melody

Donnie and Stevie, they can write you
Now you come humming in my ride too
As the music's playing in my radio
I hear that sound it sounds so beautiful
It makes me wanna just embrace you, you, you
You're close enough that I can taste you
I know just where you are 'cause you're right here next to me
