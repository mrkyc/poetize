Ray J, what it look like baby?
This yo boy Fabolouso
Got Clue on the track, yeah
I ain't the one to be wishing
I'm one to be pushing, the 600 edition
Under the cushion of air
I've been in the sea and I'm done with the fishin' I swear
But you don't see, honey your visions impaired
Maybe it's 'cause I flash the Breitling
And light the sky up like a flash of lightning
I wish I knew a way that pushes you to stay
We could play the White House like Bushes for a day
Yeah
Desert Storm!  Knockout!

Baby
As of a mattter of fact, I was the one who said I loved you first
Was about 8 years ago, don't act like you don't know
'cause you know what I'm talking about we've been through this before
Sitting at home in your momma's living room (momma's living room)
Remember how it goes
I would call you on the phone
Your mom said you we're home
But we couldn't be alone
See back then we were in school
And growing up I was a fool
And I can't lie, I'm missing you, baby, baby, baby
See Ray J LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, wahhhh
I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish, one wish (wish)
Haha, Desert Storm!

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searching I'll go, then I can have you fo' sho
Then you'll be loving me
Touching me (uuhhh)
Holding me (uuhhh)
Squeezing me (uuhhh)
So girl don't keep saying to me (uuhhh)
What I'm feelin' (uuhhh) is make believe (uuhhh)
Got me drunk in the club with two - bad ladies and I'm acting a fool
But I can't lie I'm missing you baby, baby, baby
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, stop from wild'n in the club
Third one, don't need a lot of wishes, I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends (If I get one wish)
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you (I'll love you)
If I had one wish, we would run away (If I get one wish)
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
Pop a bottle to this

I remember hoping I could bang
A girl who was holding like Trina in the ass and Oprah in the bank
It never came true but I still came through
With the Benz coupe that's electric stole plain blue
I wish you was in the leather seat on the right
But I made a wrong turn by never treating you right
And now, I'm wishing on a star
I see what's here today, could be going tomorrow
Girl, I was too busy chasing models in bikinis
Riding them drop-top model Lambourghini's
Now you got me looking in a bottle for a genie
Just to make a wish
Give me a pretty girl that can make a dish
Some Angel Hair pasta with a steak and fish
And I'll be yours
Girl, I was running wild before
Now you got me riding 'round playing Al B. Sure
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
This has been
If I had one wish, we would run away
A Desert Storm remix
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
