Well, whaddya know?
Look at me go, I'm on a rampage
See, I got this other side
And when the two collide, it's all the rage
I wonder if the thunder
Will be way too loud for you
Just creep a little closer
To make sure you feel the boom, boom, boom

Ooh, with such a sick finesse
You played me little lady like a game of chess
Oh, you're no better than me
And incidentally, we both deserve the agony
Ooh, and in between the sheets
Your screams resonate into the city streets
Fortunately, I think you can agree
There's nothing wrong with being lonely

It really comes as no surprise to me
We got stuck on the dark side
Where all of the shine died
It really comes as no surprise to me
We got stuck on the dark side
You might also like
Well, whaddya think? Twist a kink
And complicate my world
As easy as you please
You can follow my lead, girl

Ooh, with such a sick finesse
You played me pretty lady like a game of chess
Oh, you're no better than me
And incidentally, we both deserve the agony

It really comes as no surprise to me
We got stuck on the dark side
Where all of the shine died
It really comes as no surprise to me
We got stuck on the dark side

Where I think we should rip ourselves apart for fun
(Oh, just for fun)
A little self-indulgence never hurt anyone

It really comes as no surprise to me
We got stuck on the dark side
(Stuck on the dark side)
Where all of the shine died
It really comes as no surprise to me
We got stuck on the dark side
(Stuck on the dark side)
Where I think we should rip ourselves apart for fun
(Oh, just for fun)
