My guts are spilling out onto the floor
Of a nightmare you wouldn't believe
Of a nightmare you could not conceive of
You're floating above my head
There are words carved in my chest
And they said...
"Could somebody show me the kind of affection
That you only see in the movies, you know what I mean"
I will suck the elixir from your fingertips
Until I feel my head start caving in
My mouth will overflow with your evil soul
And I'll be convulsing for days in this hole
Bubbling at the lips that you used to love to kiss
Well, I think I'm trying to wake up, but I can't
These pills aren't working anymore
My eyes are gouged out and rolling under the door
It blacks out the
Nightmare you wouldn't believe
A nightmare you could not conceive of
You're floating above my head
There are words carved in my chest
And they said...
"Could somebody show me the kind of affection
That you only see in the movies, you know what I mean, you know what I mean"

Bubbling at the lips
I know you never meant to do everything you put me through
It's okay I forgive you
Just know that when you see me cringe sometimes
I'm trying to rid the poison from my mind
