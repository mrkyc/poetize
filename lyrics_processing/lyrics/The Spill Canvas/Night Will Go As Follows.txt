I will experiment with my fear right before her eyes
And every smile that's unveiled will be soaked
In my nervous charm
Then I'll say
"Is everything alright?
There's been a few things I've been meaning
To let go of tonight"
And she will say
"Everything's just fine
So you can put an end to your worrying mind"
And then our lips will collide
The August sky will then bare witness
To a brand new chapter with torn up pages
When the planets align, I can feel the gates opening
To my courage
As I proceed to run my fingers through her hair
And forget everyone who's jaded, 'cause they don't matter
And I don't care
In a confident fashion
I will admit my deepest and darkest to her
And every gaze across the table
Will send my unsuspecting body into shock

"Would you like to go inside?
And forget the world and the rules
By which we are to abide"
And she will say
"There's nothing I want more"
As we step into the room, turn off the lights and close the door
The August sky will then bare witness
To a brand new chapter with torn up pages
When the planets align, I can feel the gates opening
To my courage
As I proceed to run my fingers through her hair
And forget everyone who's jaded, 'cause they don't matter
And I don't care
No, 'cause they don't matter
And I don't care
Brash and hopeful
That my luck will not perish tonight
When the overcast tries to kill me
It's your slow motion rain
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive
Brash and hopeful
That my luck won't perish tonight
And when the overcast tries to kill me
It's your slow motion rain
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive
Brash and hopeful
That my luck will not perish tonight
And when the overcast tries to kill me
It's your slow motion rain
That falls warm on my neck that keep me alive
Consider this song a testament
Of my devotion to your saccharine scent
And to be completely honest
You're not like all the rest
You're not like all the rest
Consider this song a testament
Of my devotion to your saccharine scent
And to be completely honest
You're not like all the rest
You're not like all the rest
Oh no, you're not like all the rest
You're not like all the rest
