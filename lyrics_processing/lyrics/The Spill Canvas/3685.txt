Led to our demise
And I could never tell you how I really feel
And for that I eternally apologize
I hope you never forget the tapping at your window
With the harsh cold and the jealousy
Running through my bones
We were both selfish, but I think I was more
I would like to thank you, for showing me
A part of myself that I have never seen
Yeah, we were young and dumb, but it still was fun
And I guess these things just tend to fall apart
And I hope you feel the same
My empty promises
My empty promises
Brought us to an end
I just hurt you and I never looked back
Now I have no logic to defend
I hope you never forget the tapping at your window
With the harsh cold and the jealousy
Running through my bones
We were both selfish, but I think I was more

I would like to thank you, for showing me
A part of the world that I have never seen
Yeah, I was young and dumb, but it still was fun
I'm forever indebted to you
And I hope you feel the same
You seem like such a big part
Of my life and my heart
But the truth is I've found something new
And she easily towers over you
You seem like such a big part
Of my life and my heart
