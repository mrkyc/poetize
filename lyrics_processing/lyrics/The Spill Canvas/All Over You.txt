But I really think it's guts that matter most
I displayed them for you
Strewn out about from coast to coast
I am easily make believe
Just dress me up in what you want me to be
I'll take back what I've been saying for quite some time now
I gotta feel you in my bones again
I'm all over you
I'm not over you
I wanna taste you one more time again
I'm all over you
I'm not over you
In my daydreams, in my sleep
Infatuation turning into disease
You could cure me, see all you have to do now
Is please try
Give it your best shot and try
All I'm asking for is love
But you never seem to have enough
I gotta feel you in my bones again
I'm all over you
I'm not over you
I wanna taste you one more time again
I'm all over you
I'm not over you
This life is way too short
To get caught up in all this stuff
When I just want you to love me back
Why can't you just love me back?
