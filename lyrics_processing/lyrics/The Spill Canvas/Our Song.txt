Sometimes you wish it was a little more mysterious
When you look at me with your cinematic eyes
I wanna play the part but I forget the lines
I do it all the time
I never get it right
One day when you replay the slide show we know
Pictures won't show villains and heroes
It's just me keeping time with you
Butter knife's dull but it still cuts through
We never were
We'll never be
Strangers kissing in the pouring rain
Chasing after your leaving train
But we know that's not how our song goes, oh
You're a waitress in a cocktail bar
And I'll save you 'cause I'm a big rock star
But we know that's not how our song goes
It goes like this
You didn't like my friends and your mom didn't trust me
I thought I was slick but my moves were rusty
Bought you a 12 pack, promised you Sushi
Sorry if I wasn't straight out of a movie

We'll never be
Strangers kissing in the pouring rain
Chasing after your leaving train
But we know that's not how our song goes, oh
You're a waitress in a cocktail bar
And I'll save you 'cause I'm a big rock star
But we know that's not how our song goes
It
Be kind when you rewind the story of the two of us
Sometimes you wish it was a little more mysterious
When you look at me with your cinematic eyes
I wanna play the part but I'm messing up the lines
We never were
We'll never be
Strangers kissing in the pouring rain
Chasing after your leaving train
But we know that's not how our song goes, oh
You're a waitress in a cocktail bar
And I'll save you 'cause I'm a big rock star
But we know that's not how our song goes
