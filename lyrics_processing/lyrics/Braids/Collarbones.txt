We are so near, yet so alone
Sitting next to each other, looking at our phones
See the screen light my face in this darkened place
Do you think it makes me look pretty
When I soften all my lines away?
When I make myself look as far away from real?

Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
I have collarbones and cleavage you can rest in

This pic's lookin' better than the real
So when my clothes are off and we're together
I probably won't look this way again
And I wonder, will you still want me then?
Will you still want me when you catch the frowning of my brow and see how my breasts move around, breasts move around?
Breasts move around, breasts move around
Move up and down, move up and down

Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
I have collarbones, yeh
You might also like
Walk with me hand in hand
What the hell is going on?
We're here to feel something more
But we're just hurdling towards
Seeing and feeling nothing
Nothing more than an impulse
To move onto the next thing
And forget the last
Get hold of a new friend
That you've never even met
Can I be your new friend?
I hope I never meet you
Just stay as a number
Help make me feel better
About the craziness that is
This life

Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
I have collarbones, yeh
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
I have collarbones, yeh
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
I have collarbones, yeh
Ooh-ooh, yeh
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
Breasts pushed up, I'm tryna show you
