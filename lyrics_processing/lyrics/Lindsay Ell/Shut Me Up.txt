You did, tell 'em what you did to me
I saw you and that who did
Who did, underneath the willow tree
Two-timing bandit
Caught you red-handed
No free card out of jail
You can't deny it
I ain't keepin' quiet
If you're gonna kiss
I'm gonna tell
I'm gonna tell
You can't shut me up, can't hush my mouth
I'll bang a drum, I'll be so loud
You can't cover up the truth with duct tape
Boy, it's gonna hit you like an earthquake
Gonna sound like thunder from your rooftop
All day, all night, can't make me stop
I'm the siren you can't unplug
No, you can't shut me up, up
I'm gonna tell your mama what you did
You did, gonna tell the preacher too
The other girl you've been foolin'
Foolin' is gonna know how you do
You might also likeIf you need a reminder
You'll be the headliner
Black and white on the front page
Or just come to a show
Stand in any row
And I'll be singin' it up on the stage
You can't shut me up, can't hush my mouth
I'll bang a drum, I'll be so loud
You can't cover up the truth with duct tape
Boy, it's gonna hit you like an earthquake
Gonna sound like thunder from your rooftop
All day, all night, can't make me stop
I'm the siren you can't unplug
No, you can't shut me up, up
I'm gonna be a megaphone
Tellin' everybody how you did me wrong
The only switch that I got is "on"
Yeah, I'm gonna be a megaphone
Tellin' everybody how you did me wrong
The only switch that I got is "on"
You can't shut me up, can't hush my mouth
I'll bang a drum, I'll be so loud
You can't cover up the truth with duct tape
Boy, it's gonna hit you like an earthquake
Gonna sound like thunder from your rooftop
All day, all night, can't make me stop
I'm the siren that you can't unplug
No, you can't shut me up, up
