Thank you, Mr. Cowboy Boots
For making a fool of me
Now I know not to trust
Every sweet talking boy
In a pair of tight blue jeans
And thank you, Mr. Baseball Cap
For standing me up
You left me at the party all alone
And that's where I met
Mr. Pickup Truck

How long did you think that
I'd stay lonely or what
Guess you didn't know me
I'm good at getting over goodbye
Good thing
I ain't stuck with you forever
By the way, hey, by the way
Hey, guess who's going out tonight
By the way, hey, by the way
Guess who's going out tonight

Sorry, if you just tuned in
And you're looking for a second chance
Miss you, well I didn't have time
I was busy making other plans
You might also likeThey say yeah, but then
Love is for a reason
Kinda like you leavin'
Leaving me here, where I am
Getting on with my life

How long did you think that
I'd stay lonely or what
Guess you didn't know me
I'm good at getting over goodbye
Good thing
I ain't stuck with you forever
By the way, hey, by the way
Hey, guess who's going out tonight
By the way, hey, by the way
Guess who's going out tonight

(Hey-oh)
I want you to know my heart
Ain't broke like before
(Hey-oh)
Yeah, I don't miss you anymore
(Hey-oh)
And just in case you're wondering
I've been doing alright
And hey, by the way, by the way
Guess who's going out tonight
By the way, hey, by the way
Guess who's going out tonight

(How long)
How long did you think that
I'd stay lonely or what
Guess you didn't know me
I'm good at getting over goodbye
Good thing
(Good thing)
I ain't stuck with you forever
By the way, hey, by the way
Hey, guess who's going out tonight
By the way, hey, by the way
Guess who's going out tonight

That's right
I won't bore out tonight
That's right
I'm going out tonight
That's right
I won't bore out tonight
