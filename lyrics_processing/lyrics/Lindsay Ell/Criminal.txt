I don't wanna close my eyes
Why pretend I'm going to sleep
When I know damn well I'm gonna keep lying here wide awake?
Waiting for the breath you take, to come back
I can't relax, I'm a tiger pacing in my cage
Cocked like a twelve guage
Feeling like a teenage crush, you're the rush
You're the habit that I can never get enough of

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

I, have the right to remain silent
But there ain't no way that I can
'Cause I'm wired like a ticking time bomb
It's so wrong, but it feels right
Tonight you repeating like an echo
Baby I can't let go, got me going klepto like a thief
Yeah I'd steal, just to keep on feeling what I feel
You might also like
Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

Oh, don't try to save me
Oh, you never gonna save me

Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
Yeah, what you do to me is criminal
