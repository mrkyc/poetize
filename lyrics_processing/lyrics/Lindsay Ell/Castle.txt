I could win the lottery tomorrow
And still wanna win on a ticket the next week
There's always gonna be somethin' better
'Cause the top is never high enough to reach
There's always gonna be more money, more fame
More chances you can take
You forget what you could lose
When you only see what you can gain

Even when the sun is shinin'
We just see the shadow
We wanna win the war so bad
We don't care about the battle
Once you feel the fire
It feels like nothing holds a candle
And even if we had a house up on a hill
I bet we'd want a castle
Mm-mm yeah
I bet we'd want a castle

So focused on we get to where we're going
We're too blind to see we're right where we need to be
We're never satisfied with livin' in the moment
We're too anxious to let it happen naturally

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I bet we'd want a castle

All we ever do is dream
We think our dreams will be evergreen
But there's always gonna be another thing

Even when the sun is shinin'
We just see the shadow
We wanna win the war so bad
We don't care about the battle
Once you feel the fire
It feels like nothing holds a candle
And even if we had a house up on a hill
I bet we'd want a castle
Yeah, yeah, yeah
