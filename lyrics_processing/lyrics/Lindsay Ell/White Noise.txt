Silence and breathing
That's all I hear these days
The ceiling fan spinnin'
Rumors beginnin'
That's all I hear these days
'Cause your memory is hotter than the static
My head on your heart was such a habit
Going crazy now that I don't have it
I don't have it
Another headache from a loud crowd Friday
Another lover throwing gravel in the driveway
Another love song driving down the highway
But it's just white noise, it's just white noise
Another wake up to the TV on sunrise
Another break-up with the echo of your goodbyes
But it's just white noise, it's just white noise
'Cause I miss you, boy
So it's just white noise
Bartender, last drink
Taxi on South Street
That's all I hear these days
Friends calling friends "Baby"
All in love and crazy
That's all I hear these days

So it's just white noise
Anything other than your voice
Anything other than your voice
Anything other than your voice
Is just white noise
