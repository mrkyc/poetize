Say goodbye, man
It's the same old fork in the road
I could cry, I guess
Damsel in distress
That's the role I really know
If I gotta get over it
Then I oughta get on with it
I'm not gonna be just another girl that's addicted to hurt
Walking around in a daze, for days in a shirt
Who goes and throws the dirt or throws the darts
Just another girl with a chip on her shoulder
Once she got out of love, was a little bit older
And a couple of names on a chain
I'm not gonna be just another girl, just another girl
Just another girl with a broken heart
Just another girl, just another girl
Just another girl with a broken heart
God, I'm really bored
Feeling sorry for
Me on a Saturday night
I could turn the page
Forget about the wait
I've done it every other time
I could just stay mad as hell
But I don't wear with it well
