You've a room over the shop here?
Times is so hard, why don't you rent it out?

People think it's haunted.

Haunted?

Yeah.
And who's to say they're wrong?
You see, years ago...something happened up there.
Something not very nice.
(sung)
There was a barber and his wife
And he was beautiful
A proper artist with a knife
But they transported him for life
And he was beautiful
(spoken)
Barker, his name was.
Benjamin Barker.
What was his crime?

Foolishness
(sung)
He had this wife, you see
Pretty little thing, silly little nit
Had her chance for the moon on a string
Poor thing
Poor thing
There was this judge, you see
Wanted her like mad
Every day he sent her a flower
But did she come down from her tower?
Sat up there and sobbed by the hour
Poor fool
But there was worse yet to come, poor thing
Well, Beadle calls on her all polite
Poor thing, poor thing
The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite
He blames himself for her dreadful plight
She must come straight to his house tonight
Poor thing, poor thing
Of course, when she goes there
Poor thing, poor thing
They're having this ball all in masks
There's no one she knows there
Poor dear, poor thing
She wanders tormented and drinks, poor thing
The Judge has repented, she thinks, poor thing
"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?", she asks
He was there all right, only not so contrite
She wasn't no match for such craft, you see
And everyone thought it so droll
They figured she had to be daft, you see
So all of them stood there and laughed, you see
Poor soul
Poor thing

No!
Would no one, have mercy on her?

So, it is you.
Benjamin Barker?
No, not Barker.
That man is dead.
It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd.
