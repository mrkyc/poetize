That's all very well, but what are we gonna do about him?

Later on when it's dark, we'll take it to some secret place and bury him

Oh yeah. Of course we could do that
I don't 'spose he's got any relatives gonna come pokin' 'round lookin' for him
Seems a downright shame...

Shame?

Seems an awful waste...
Such a nice, plump frame
Wot's 'is name has...
Had...
Has
Nor it can't be traced...
Bus'ness needs a lift
Debts to be erased...
Think of it as thrift
As a gift
If you get my drift
You might also likeSeems an awful waste...
I mean, with the price of meat
What it is
When you get it
If you get it...

Ah!

Good, you got it!
Take, for instance, Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop!
Bus'ness never better using only pussycats and toast!
Now a pussy's good for maybe six or seven at the most!
And I'm sure they can't compare as far as taste!
(simultaneously)

Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion

Well, it does seem a waste...

Eminently practical
And yet appropriate as always!
Think about it...

Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived
Without you all these years, I'll never know!
How delectable!
Also undetectable!

Lots of other gentlemen'll
Soon be comin' for a shave
Won't they?
Think of
All them
Pies!

How choice!
How
Rare!
For what's the sound of the world out there?

What, Mr. Todd?
What, Mr. Todd?
What is that sound?
Those crunching noises pervading the air!

Yes, Mr. Todd!
Yes, Mr. Todd!
Yes, all around!

It's man devouring man, my dear!
And/Then who are we to deny it in here?

These are desperate times
Mrs. Lovett, and desperate measures are called for

Here we are, now! Hot out of the oven!

What is that?

It's priest. Have a little priest

Is it really good?

Sir, it's too good, at least!
Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh
So it's pretty fresh

Awful lot of fat

Only where it sat

Haven't you got poet, or something like that?

No, y'see, the trouble with poet is
'Ow do you know it's deceased?
Try the priest!
Lawyer's rather nice

If it's for a price

Order something else, though, to follow
Since no one should swallow it twice!

Anything that's lean?

Well, then, if you're British and loyal
You might enjoy Royal Marine!
Anyway, it's clean
Though of course, it tastes of wherever it's been!

Is that squire, on the fire?

Mercy no, sir, look closer
You'll notice it's grocer!

Looks thicker
More like vicar!

No, it has to be grocer --
It's green!

The history of the world, my love --

Save a lot of graves
Do a lot of relatives favors!

Is those below serving those up above!

Ev'rybody shaves
So there should be plenty of flavors!

How gratifying for once to know

That those above will serve those down below!

What is that?

It's fop
Finest in the shop
And we have some shepherd's pie peppered
With actual shepherd on top!
And I've just begun --
Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily
Have one!

Put it on a bun
Well, you never know if it's going to run!

Try the friar
Fried, it's drier!

No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy!

Then actor
It's compacter!

Ah but always arrives overdone!
(spoken)
I'll come again when you have judge on the menu!
(sung)
Have charity towards the world, my pet!

Yes, yes, I know, my love!

We'll take the customers that we can get!

High-born and low, my love!

We'll not discriminate great from small!
No, we'll serve anyone
Meaning anyone

And to anyone
