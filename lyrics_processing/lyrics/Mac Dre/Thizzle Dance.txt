Hello, everybody
Hi
I'd like to introduce you to the Thizzle Dance
Thizzle Dance?
Thizzle Dance I said
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?
(Can you do the Thizzle Dance?)

First, I do like this (Like this)
Put a look on my face like I smelled some piss
Bounce to the beat 'til it start to hurt
Then I dust all the smirk off me shirt
Dip to the ground as I catch the bass
Then I wipe all the sweat off me face (Off me face)
Hop back up then I start to slide
Popping my collar as I glide
Then I break the thing down and do The Bird
Dust myself off like I just stole third
Come on, everybody, now's the chance (Come on)
Fuck the Harlem Shake, this the Thizzle Dance (The Thizzle Dance)

Dance, Thizz Dance

First of all, I hope you got you a juice (First of all)
A thizzle because it's time to pop you a few
Then you gas, brake (Brake), start to dip (Start to dip)
Bounce with the car as it start to shit (As it start to shit)
Open up the car doze the whole damn car low
Hop out and follow, while you let the car roll
Ghostride the whip while you ride the strip
Here's your chance to do your dance on the side of it
While you at it the passenger and driver switch (And the driver switch)
Then hurry up and jump back inside your shit (Hurry up and jump right back in your shit)
Hanging out the rooftop
Do not get ooh-aahed by them fool cops, they tryna have you got
Other than that you and your boys 'coon big
You wanna learn 'coon stay tuned to Thizz
Hoochie mama freaks, get your man (Get your man)
And show them niggas how to do the Thizzle Dance (Thizzle Dance)

Just like the niggas that I'm chillin' with (That I'm chillin' with)
You can't do the Thizz 'less you're pillin' it ('Less you're pillin' it)
This is the last verse then I'm sealin' it (Then I'm sealin' it)
After this niggas gon' be stealin' it (N****s gon' be stealin' it)
This is hip hop with no Johnny Gill in it (No Johnny Gill in it)
No New Edition or Prince when I'm spillin' it
I'm 12 years strong and I'm still in it (Still in it)
Now I'm slugged up and diamond grillin' it (Diamond grillin' it)
I don't care who I'm in the building with
I'll do the dance with Nancy Von Chillinwich
