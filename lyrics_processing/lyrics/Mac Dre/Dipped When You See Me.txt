I'm dipped when they see me
(I'm dipped when they see me)
They don't wanna see me

These niggas wanna be me

I smoke Backwood blunts 'cause they the most expensive
Me no work, don't touch no nuts and wrenches
You always see me shopping like it's Christmas
I'm always tree shopping like it's Christmas
Miami my witness, I'm flammy relentless
Yes, I pimp, bitch, and no, I didn't rent this
I'm showing no interest in them girls that's broke
You need bank and dank for Furl to smoke
Jumbo prawns and Australian lobster
I want everything life has to offer
Coppers jealous 'cause me and my fellas
Eat fillets, no more hot dogs and relish
Two sets of grills, two sets of wheels
Whatever I feel, I do sex and pills
Coogi in the winter with the matchin' beanie
Eating linguini
I'm dipped when they see me

It's my turn to live like the Osbournes
Keep rollin', baby, let's smoke 'til our eyes burn
I'm not concerned with your petty affairs
You been drivin' in that same old Chevy for years
Out with old, in with the new
This ain't 2K2, nigga, what you gon' do?
It's 2K3, and it's almost over
Let me see, July, August, September, October, yup
Boy, you better hurry up, flip you a model
And some of that new car smell that come in a bottle
When I come through it's like watchin' TV
I'm a living video
I'm dipped when they see me
I'm dipped when they see me
(I'm dipped when they see me)
They don't wanna see me
(They don't wanna see me)
These niggas wanna be me
