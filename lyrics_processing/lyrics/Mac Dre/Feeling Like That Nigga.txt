Chillin' at a house party, me and my 40
Chokin' off dank rolled up in a pierogi
Cot everywhere, I mean the bitches was at that
I'm peepin' the scene seeing who I'ma mac at
This bitch walked in lookin real prizznity
With no hesitation, I step to the brizznity
Said, "How you doin', baby, can I spit at you?
Saucy young tender, can I get at you?"
She musta recognized the potent pimpin' on sight
'Cause she was jockin' MD for the rest of the night
We smoked dank, and drank Tanqueray
I said, "Baby, are you sure you can hang with Dre?"
With the party still poppin' we shook the spot
Cut to my Brougham and I took the cot
For 25 minutes MD was shovin' it
She was screamin' my name and I could tell she was lovin' it
Cock was thrusted, nuts was busted
In this no good bitch that some nigga trusted
Pulled up my pants and she put on some lipstick
Went back in the party feelin' pimperistic
I couldn't help but notice that this nigga was starin'
I thought he was trippin' off the clothes I was wearin'
But, he stepped to MD and said, "What's up, punk?
You been fuckin' my bitch and now I want some funk"
I said, "I'm not with the drama so you can save the theatrical
I macked on your bitch 'cause she appeared to be mackable"
But instead of this nigga being real on a playa
He took a step back and tried to steal on a playa
I said, "Look fool, nobody smashes Dre
I throw these thangs like young Cassius Clay"
With one blow, I sent the punk to the flo'
And said, "Get your ass up if you want some more"
These niggas ran up, they musta been his crew
Now tell me what the fuck was I supposed to do?
Cut to the Brougham and got the M-double-8
So I can get these motherfuckers from up out of my face
Let off a rat-a-tat, hopped in my Cadillac
And burned long rubber on them suckas I gatted at
Yeah
You might also like
I got my choppa on my left with my finger on the trigga
Rollin' in a glasshouse feelin' like that nigga
Suckas started static last night now I'm searchin'
Finna put some work in, 'gnac got me perkin'
Seen a sucka posted with his bitch at the liquor store
Put in the clip and go, didn't mean to hit the ho
Fully automatic Mac-11 spittin' fast
Make sure I get that ass, then I hit the gas
Punch it to the hood, switchin' up now I'm back
Rollin' in the 'Lac, still sippin' 'gnac
Rollers to their right get behind me, I don't trip
They lookin' for a nigga in a Chev', I don't slip
High speed chase if they want to harass me
Put the lights on, switch lanes then pass me
Had me kinda 'noid but no longer am I spooked
And man, like I said, if they jacked me they was juked
Creep to the spot where the homeboys romp
Niggas on the dice gettin' paid shootin' twamps
30 minutes later, pockets fat, now I'm cool
Steppin' out the house, niggas scream "Get that fool"
Suckas smash up in the deuce and a squirrel
Three bald heads and a nigga with a curl
Bullets let loose, I get it in the chest
Fools smash off screamin', "Trick, fuck the Crest"
Waitin' for the motherfuckin' ambulance
Thinkin' to myself: I don't stand a chance
Dizzy and my breathing is impossible
Next thing I know I'm at the hospital
Wakin' up hurt, fresh out the trauma
Lookin' at my bitch, and my baby's mama
They tryna act cool, but I know they hate it
My baby's mama said, "Damn Dre, you barely made it"
Straight tore back, sore than a motherfucker
Thinkin' to myself: Man, I gotta smoke another sucka
Chillin', illin', back on the street
Strapped with my gat layin' in the back seat
Got a white boy drivin' lookin' like a nerd
Rollin' in a fucked up Thunderbird
Got my gloves on, hoodie and my mask and
Mad than a motherfucker, finna do some blastin'
We hit this dope track like we lookin' for some rocks
And I hop out the back door and quickly get to poppin'
Suckas start droppin', and I stop cappin'
And hop back in, just like nothin' happened
I'm puttin' in work, killin' fools dissin'
A motherfuckin' savage, a nigga on a mission
