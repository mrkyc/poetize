Man, through fuckin' around
You niggas keep on, you gon' be duckin' some rounds
I'm rushin' the mound, bitch done hit me with a pitch
He a snitch and he walk with a switch
He in a band that sing for the cops
Him and his mans, they cleanin' up shop
Undercover concert promotor
Ricky Schroder tryin' to turn somebody over
Put that E.T. finger up, you stoolie
Don't tattletale, the number one ruley
You the jumpers, the boys, the people
Slipped in the game, sellin' toys to people
I avoid them people, don't ask me shit
The only law I break is in public, grip
My mouth zipped, I plead the fifth
And niggas like you get pushed off a cliff

Don't ask me shit (I don't tell, mayne)
I don't tell (You can send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I won't tell, mayne)
I won't tell (Send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I don't tell, mayne)
I don't tell (You can send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I won't tell, mayne)
I won't tell (Send me to jail, mayne)

I'm on to you, boy, you used to be the man
'Til I caught you in the courtroom sitting on the stand
Got to waving your hand and pointing your finger
Holding the mic like some type of rap singer
I seen you, you told and now you gotta live with it
They gone get you and probably say Diggs did it
Fuck you, fuck who you kin to
Fuck what you going through and fuck what you been through
Consider this a warning to you cats out rapping
The streets get ugly when a drought 'bout happen
You rap niggas out here starving for fame
Better watch who you fuck with, it's scarrin' your name
My young nigga locked up, ball and chain
And y'all niggas acting like it's all in the game
I hear niggas on the street wanna blast this bitch
And when it happen, don't ask me shit

Don't ask me shit (I don't tell, mayne)
I don't tell (You can send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I won't tell, mayne)
I won't tell (Send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I don't tell, mayne)
I don't tell (You can send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I won't tell, mayne)
I won't tell (Send me to jail, mayne)
You can line 'em up and put twelve in a box
And find out your boy is workin' with the cops
Doin' flip-flops, the Rover rollin' over
The Tootsie Roller, scared to do a quarter
It's October and he can't be gone 'til November
So he's givin' up the gang, every damn member
Everything he remember, he's tellin'
He get out of jail free, ain't no bailin'
He's no felon, he's no misdemeanor
He got a target melon and a E.T. finger
Nigga, you the cleaners, tryin' to wash me
Quit peepin' at my Bimmer, tryin' to watch me

Don't ask me shit (I don't tell, mayne)
I don't tell (You can send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I won't tell, mayne)
I won't tell (Send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I don't tell, mayne)
I don't tell (You can send me to jail, mayne), send me to jail
Don't ask me shit (I won't tell, mayne)
