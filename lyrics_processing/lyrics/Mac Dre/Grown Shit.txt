Yep, yeah, yep, yeah, yep
Don't stop, won't stop, won't quit
Never could, never would
Mac Dre back with some mo' shit
You know (Yadida mean, Yadida mean)
Come on, man (Come on, man)
Uh

I'm a rap-matic track addict
And I'm back at it
Play me a beat with this heat, I'ma blap at it
The cat scatted, when the mac spatted
You don't want to see me, punk get your hat flatted
Dope like a crack addict, or a hop head
Spit it clear so you can hear what I said
Pothead, hot head nigga that got dreads
Got bread, stop red, get hit with the hot lead
My bed, you might see three things
High heels, my pills and hoes in G strings
I see things through my pimpin' glasses
Cheesy macaroni, teaching pimpin' classes
I dips and mashes, Mercedes Benzes
Might wear stunnas without the lenses
I'm off the hinges, I handle business
Leave no clues, witness or forensics
No co-defendants, all by my lonesome
Won't see Solano, Quintin or Folsom
I ghost 'em at the four way stop sign
Forty HK don't fuck with Glock nine
I rock rhymes, I'm a star, I'm famous
Got my own language, cool when I swang it
Oh, I'm all out the do'
351 with the shift in the flo'

Come on, you beezy, let's do some grown shit
Put on a tight thong too small that don't fit
When I'm on the thizz I'm a fool, I don't quit
Unborn kids, nut all on shit
Come on, you beezy, let's do some grown shit
Put on a tight thong too small that don't fit
When I'm on the thizz I'm a fool, I don't quit
Unborn kids, nut all on shit

Dre rock rhymes from here to New York
Only smoke rope, no coke or Newports
Hibachi Benihana pork on my fork
Rapping is a sport and this is my court
Do anything to win, my referees cheat
I flagrant foul and bruise to beat
Read 'em and weep
I'm a royal flush
Give me some shrooms
So I can get mushed
Kick dust, always in something tight
Hella loud with the whistle or the suction pipe
Fucking dikes, in Vegas or Reno, ask Kilo, nigga he know
I'm well connected, I know big whales
Did shows in harryels, been in hella jails, the federals
But nigga, it never fails
The shit don't stop when I drop hella sales
Hella mail, call me the postman
From Vallejo, born in Oakland
Yoking, Dodge Diplomats
Fuck three strikes get the bitch to bat
Come on, you beezy, let's do some grown shit
Put on a tight thong too small that don't fit
When I'm on the thizz I'm a fool, I don't quit
Unborn kids, nut all on shit
Come on, you beezy, let's do some grown shit
Put on a tight thong too small that don't fit
When I'm on the thizz I'm a fool, I don't quit
