Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world that's
A distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories
Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm cryin'
Reflects a hurt I can't control

'Cause although you're gone
I keep holdin' on
To the happy times
Ooh, when you were mine
You might also like
As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterday
And all the love I gave all in vain

(All the love)
All the love that I've wasted
(All the tears)
All the tears that I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt that you have caused
Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust
After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of lovin' you

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me
In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
