It's hurtin' me, it's hurtin' me
This doubt is hurtin' me

So remove this doubt from my heart, little boy
And let me live my life knowing you care
Remove this doubt from my mind, little boy
And let me breathe again, feeling my love you share

Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There's no joy in the air
I just don't think you care

Close the door of doubt forevermore
And may it nevermore make me unsure
Turn the key and lock away this doubt in me
Keep it in the dark, not in my heart

Be more tender
Completely surrender
Your love to me
Be sweet and not discreet
You might also like
Remove this doubt from my heart, little boy
And let me live my life knowin' you care
Remove this doubt from my mind, little boy
And let me breathe again, feeling my love you share

Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There's no joy in the air
I just don't think you care

(Remove this doubt in our hearts)
