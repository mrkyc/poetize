You packed your bags, as I recall
And you walked slowly down the hall
You said you had to get away to ease your mind
And all you needed was a just little of time

Oh, winter's passed, spring and fall
You never wrote me, you never called
(Yeah) Nathan Jones, you've been gone too long
Gone too long (Gone too long)

If a woman could die of tears
Nathan Jones, I wouldn't be here
The key that you're holding (Holding) won't fit my door
And there's no room in my heart for you no more

'Cause winter's passed, spring and fall
You never wrote me (Ooh-ooh), you never called
Nathan Jones, you've been gone too long
(Gone too long)

Do-do-do

Mm-hmm
Nathan Jones, oh

Winter's passed, spring and fall
You never wrote me (You never wrote me), you never called (You never called)
(Oh-oh) Nathan Jones, you've been gone too long
Mm-mm-mm, gone too long (Gone too long)
Nathan Jones, you've been gone too long (Gone too long)
You've been gone too long (Gone too long)
Hey, Nathan Jones, you've been gone too long (Gone too long)
Hey, you know, you've been gone (Gone too long)
Nathan Jones, you've been gone too long (Gone too long)
