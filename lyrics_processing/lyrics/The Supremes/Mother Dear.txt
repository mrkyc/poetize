Something's on my mind
Mother dear, the boy keeps me crying
Don't know which way to turn
Keeps me so confused (Help, help me, Mother dear)
Keeps me so confused (Help, help me, Mother dear)

Mother dear
'Cause for him I yearn
But he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad

I wish I didn't love him so (Help, help me, Mother dear)
'Cause now I can't let him go
His kiss gets a little sweeter
Ooh, my heart gets a little weaker

I'm falling deeper (Deeper, deeper)
Deeper in love each day (Help, help me, Mother dear)
I know he's no good for me
But I'm too weak to break away

Ooh, each day love gets a little stronger (Help, help, Mother dear, help, help, Mother dear)
Ooh, heartaches lasts a little longer (Help, help, Mother dear, help, help, Mother dear)
You might also like
Help, help me Mother dear
'Cause I can't help myself (Help, help me, Mother dear)
Ooh, he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad

So many times I've tried (Help, help me, Mother dear)
Telling him we're through (Help, help me, Mother dear)
But when he takes me in his arms
There's nothing I can do

Ooh, it's no use (It's no use)
I can't break loose (I can't break loose)
I keep lovin' him more and more and more (Help, help me, Mother dear)
Each passing day (Help, help me, Mother dear)

All my love, to him I give it (Help, help, Mother dear, help, help, Mother dear)
Without him around, I couldn't live (Help, help, Mother dear, help, help, Mother dear)
I need him so, and he knows it (Help, help, Mother dear, help, help, Mother dear)
Can't let him go, and I show it (Help, help, Mother dear, help, help, Mother dear)

Help, help me Mother dear
I'm so in love with him (Help, help me, Mother dear)
But he treats your daughter bad
Keeps your daughter sad
Help, help me Mother dear
Help, help me Mother dear
Ooh, he keeps your daughter crying
Keeps your daughter sad (Help, help me, Mother dear)
