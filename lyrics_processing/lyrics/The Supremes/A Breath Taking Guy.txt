You didn't bat an eye (An eye)
My darling, won't you tell me why
You're actin' strange toward me? (Strange)
Why have you changed toward me? (Changed)

One night love-makin'
Next day heart-breakin'

Last night your love was true (Was true)
The next day you were gone
And I was blue (Was blue)
And you were movin' on (Moved on)
And I was left to cry alone
What have I done to you? (Done)
