Where lovers go
And flowers grow forever more
Where time is standing still
And lovers fill
The quiet places by the shore
We'll cross the rainbow
To a place where we'll be free
And he'll give his love to me
So, I wait for the day
When he takes me away to
Paradise
He'll take me by the hand to
Paradise
We'll walk along the sand in
Paradise
A never-never-land
Paradise
Ooh
We'll build a castle there
Where we can share
The happiness we've waited for
Where white flamingos fly
Way up high
And way above the ocean's roar
Yeah yeah
You might also likeWe'll climb the mountain
To see our wonderland
Maybe now, you'll understand
Why I wait for the day
When he takes me away to
Paradise
He'll take me by the hand to
Paradise
We'll walk along the sand in
Paradise
A never-never-land
Paradise
Ooh
I'll stand by him
Do right by him
And I swear
I swear I'll die for him
Die for him, die for him
Paradise
He'll take me by the hand to
Paradise
