(Someday we'll be together)
Ooh, ah, say, say, say, say it again
(You tell her) Someday we'll be together
Oh yeah, oh yeah

You're far away
From me, my love (Sing it pretty)
And just as sure, my, my baby
As there are stars above
Wanna say, wanna say, wanna say it

(Someday we'll be together) Mmm
Ah, yes we will, yes we will (Sing)
(Someday we'll be together) Some sweet day
Ah, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

My love is yours, baby
Oh, right from the start (Do you mean it, honey?)
You, you, you possess my soul now, honey
And I know, I know you own my heart and I wanna say it (Tell her)

A long time ago, na na, sweet thing
I made a big mistake, honey
I (Say it)
Say I said goodbye, oh, oh (Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
Baby, ever (Ever)
Ever and ever and ever (Ever)
Ever since that day, now (Ever since that day)
All I (All I wanna do)
All I wanna do, (All I wanna do)
Oh, is cry, cry, cry
Hey, hey, hey

I long for you (Oh, yes I do)
Every, every night (Mmm, mmm)
Ooh, just to kiss your sweet, sweet lips, baby
Hold you ever, ever so tight and I wanna say it (Sing)

Ah, yes we will, yes we will
Someday we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will

Ah honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Someday we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will
