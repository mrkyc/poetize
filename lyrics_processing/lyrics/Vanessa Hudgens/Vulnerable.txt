When I think about you and me
I get a little weak in the knees
I feel the flutter of the butterflies
And sometimes I can hardly breathe

So, baby (Baby), hold me now (Hold me, hold me now)
I can't tell if I'm lost or found
('Cause I'm livin' in a dream, and I don't wanna wake up, wake up)
And I don't know how to let you in (Don't know, don't know)
Or let you go, I'm so vulnerable
Hold me now (Hold me)
Please, baby, don't let me down
('Cause I'm livin' in a dream, and I don't wanna wake up)
I know for sure that you're the cure
Comin' down with a case of "I love you more"
I don't wanna be vulnerable

When it comes to this book of us
I think it's time now to turn the page
And I don't wanna say I love you first
But, my heart, it can hardly wait

So, baby (Baby), hold me now (Hold me, hold me now)
I can't tell if I'm lost or found
('Cause I'm livin' in a dream, and I don't wanna wake up, wake up)
And I don't know how to let you in (Don't know, don't know)
Or let you go, I'm so vulnerable
Hold me now (Hold me)
Please, baby, don't let me down
('Cause I'm livin' in a dream, and I don't wanna wake up)
I know for sure that you're the cure
Comin' down with a case of "I love you more"
I don't wanna be vulnerable
You might also like
I don't wanna see you hurt
Don't you worry, baby girl
Take my hand, understand I'm afraid
To tell you the very words that you want to hear me say (Wake up)
When you say it here tonight, will you mean it for life?
Will you tell me everything that your heart is really feelin' for me
So I (So I) won't be vulnerable?
('Cause I'm livin' in a dream, and I don't wanna wake up, wake up)

And I don't know how to let you in (Don't know, don't know)
Or let you go, I'm so vulnerable
Hold me now (Hold me)
Please, baby, don't let me down
('Cause I'm livin' in a dream, and I don't wanna wake up)
I know for sure that you're the cure
Comin' down with a case of "I love you more"
