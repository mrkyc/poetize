Let go
All I wanna do tonight
Oh-oh

The day's been long, I just got home
And work is drivin' me crazy
I could do up, I could go out
But I'm feelin' too lazy
I wanna run, I wanna have fun
But I don't wanna work it

All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight

(All I wanna do tonight) All I wanna do is let go tonight
Feelin' right, I just wanna forget about it (Hey)
All I wanna do is let go tonight
Wind it up without my getup (Oh)
(All I wanna do tonight) All I wanna do is get down tonight
Move around tonight, don't really care about it (Me and my girls tonight)
All I wanna do is let go tonight
I'm feelin' free, tonight is just for me

Yeah, I'm hopin' you feel it
'Cause I'm my best and I'm my worst
Yeah, you've already seen it
Let down your hair, the hell, who cares?
Gonna let it all out

All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight
(Oh, woah-woah)

(All I wanna do tonight) All I wanna do is let go tonight (Let go)
Feelin' right, just wanna forget about it
(All I wanna do tonight) All I wanna do is let go tonight (Let go)

(All I wanna do tonight) All I wanna do is let go tonight (Let go)
I'm feelin' free, tonight is just for me

High heels just feels
Like a business stance, make it hard to dance
Tight shirt, short skirt
Just hurt, too much work
A fake-up of makeup
Never handled the wet, 'cause I wanna sweat
All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

All I wanna do is let go tonight (Let go; woah, yeah)
Feelin' right, just wanna forget about it
All I wanna do is let go tonight (Let go; yeah, yeah)
Wind it up without my getup (Yeah)
All I wanna do is get down tonight (Let go, let go)
Move around tonight, don't really care about it (Me and my girls tonight)

All I wanna do is go and kick it with my crew tonight

(All I wanna do) All I wanna do is let go tonight (Let go; yeah)
Feelin' right, just wanna forget about it
(All I wanna do, yeah) All I wanna do is let go tonight (Let go)
Wind it up without my getup
(All I wanna do, yeah) All I wanna do is get down tonight (Let go)
Move around tonight, don't really care about it (Me and my girls tonight)
All I wanna do is let go tonight (Let go)
I'm feelin' free, tonight is just for me
(All I wanna do tonight) All I wanna do is let go tonight (Yeah)
Feelin' right, just wanna forget about it (Hey)
