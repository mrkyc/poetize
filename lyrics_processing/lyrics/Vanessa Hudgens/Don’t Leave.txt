I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave, I won't stop you

I've been gone so long, I'm used to feelin' alone
I estimated our love, my estimation was wrong
See, I never knew what you were goin' through
But I just got back, now I see where you're at

How could you have doubted that I'd ever be distracted by
Any other guy, no matter if he ever caught my eye?
We just need time, some time to connect
What I'm tellin' you now, hope you never forget it

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave, I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me
To be the one, the only one you wanna run to
Baby boy, you know I've just begun to
Realize what's important to me
So don't leave, don't leave
You might also like
Maybe I should've tried to put your needs first
But my priorities were messed up and I know you got hurt
See, I never knew what you were goin' through
But I just got back, now I see where you're at

Think about it, take a moment just to rewind
Everything that you believe in, everything that was right
Do you really wanna stand there and tell me goodbye
When I'm sayin' I still love you?

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave, I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me
To be the one, the only one you wanna run to
Baby boy, you know I've just begun to
Realize what's important to me
So don't leave, don't leave

Lonely days and lonely nights
That's where you'd be without me by your side
Better think twice, baby, oh
This could blow up crazy, you know
I can't keep singin', I'm speakin' 'cause it's out of control
I give you everything: body, mind, heart and soul
But you keep breakin' me, takin' me to another low
Don't do it, baby, don't do it, don't let me go
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave, I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me
To be the one, the only one you wanna run to
Baby boy, you know I've just begun to
Realize what's important to me
So don't leave, don't leave
