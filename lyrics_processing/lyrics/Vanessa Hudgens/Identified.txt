I know what you're tryin' to do, know what you're tryin' to say
You're givin' me the eye, then pushin' me away
It's like you're playin' games, like you're the only one
We're both one and the same, so think about it

All your friends are tellin' me there's only one ambition on your mind
You keep on denyin' it, but all the proof I need is in your eyes

You can say what you want, play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart, 'cause you're smart
Put up a front, but I see what's inside
Gotcha identified
You play my heart, 'cause you're smart

You keep askin' how I am and watchin' what I do
You're waitin' for the chance, come on and tell the truth
It's more than obvious the way you cover up
So tell me, why the fuss? Just come on over

All your friends are tellin' me there's only one ambition on your
Mind-mind-mind, mind, mind-mind-mind, mind-mind
You keep on denyin' it, but all the proof I need is in your eyes
(It's in your eyes)

You can say what you want, play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart, 'cause you're smart
Put up a front, but I see what's inside
Gotcha identified
You play my heart, 'cause you're smart
You can say what you want, play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart, 'cause you're smart
Put up a front, but I see what's inside
Gotcha identified
You play my heart, 'cause you're smart

I got a confession
I got, I got a confession
I got, I got a confession
I got, I got a confession
I got, I got a confession
I got, I got a confession
(I got, I got, I got, I got)

I got a confession
I can see through what you're doin'
Had it right from the beginning
Gotcha identified
Come on over to me
Tell me now, before you lose me
It's no secret, you pursue me
Gotcha identified
You can say what you want, play it cool if you like
But you're identified
You play my heart, 'cause you're smart
Put up a front, but I see what's inside
Gotcha identified

But you're identified
You play my heart, 'cause you're smart
Put up a front, but I see what's inside
