Just when it's getting good, I slowly start to freeze
Just when it's feelin' real, I put my heart to sleep
It's the memory I can't see, then this fear comes over me
Understand that I don't mean to push you away from me

Why am I so afraid to crash down and lose my heart again?
I don't know, I can't see
What's come over me?
Why am I so afraid to break down and lose my mind again?
I don't know, I can't see
What's come over me?

You got a way of easin' me out of myself
I can't stay, but I can't leave
I am my worst enemy
Please understand that it's not you, it's what I do
Just when I'm about to run, I realize what I've become

Why am I so afraid to crash down and lose my heart again?
I don't know, I can't see
What's come over me?
Why am I so afraid to break down and lose my mind again?
I don't know, I can't see
What's come over me?

(What's come over me?) Yeah-yeah
(Come over me) Over me
(What's come over me?) Yeah

Now I wonder what you think of me
Don't know why I break so easily
All my fears are armed, surroundin' me
I can't get no sleep
I keep runnin' in circles around you
Are you the trap I wanna fall into?
Yeah

Why am I so afraid to crash down and lose my heart again?
I don't know, I can't see
What's come over me?
Why am I so afraid to break down and lose my mind again?
I don't know, I can't see
What's come over me?
(Why am I so afraid) To crash down and lose my heart again?
I don't know, I can't see
What's come over me?
I'm so alone without you (So alone)
(Break down and lose my mind again) Without you
