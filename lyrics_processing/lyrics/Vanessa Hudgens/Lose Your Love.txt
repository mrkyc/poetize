If I should lose your love, boy
Shame on me, I was just too stubborn, too blind to see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love (I don't wanna lose your love)
Don't wanna lose your love

I remember the moment I first looked in your eyes
And seen nothin' lookin' back at me
It was then I realized that even though you were there
Your heart was long gone
And I knew right then how lost I'd be
Before you move on

If I should lose your love, boy
Shame on me, I was just too stubborn, too blind to see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love (I don't wanna lose your love)
Don't wanna lose your love

Before it's final, before you close the door
I'm asking him, please, can we try this once more?
Just hold me tight, don't never let go
And if never comes around, I want you to know

I don't want you, I need you
Can't lose you tonight, no, no
I won't do nothin' to lose you
I won't lose this fight
I'm gonna make it right (Oh, yeah), right (Right)

If I should lose your love, boy
Shame on me, I was just too stubborn, too blind to see (Too blind to see) That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love, lose your love (Lose your love)
Shame on me, I was just too stubborn, too blind to see
That I would lose your love, boy
Just tell me how to get you back
'Cause I could never lose your love (Lose your love)
Don't wanna lose your love (I don't wanna lose your love)
