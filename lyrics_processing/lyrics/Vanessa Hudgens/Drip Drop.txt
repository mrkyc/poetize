Drip drop
Drip drop

Now only Heaven knows
How I really feel inside
I try my best not to let it show
But late at night, in my room, I think of you and start to cry

You know that I'm emotional (Oh, yeah)
But still you break my heart, now let's make no mistake
We both know that you're the one responsible
For hurting me this way, now my tears fall like rain

Drip drop
When will my tear drops stop fallin' for you?
(Don't know what to do)
Tick tock, steady as a clock, drip drop
I'm hopin' someday soon I'll be over you
Drip drop
When will my tear drops stop fallin' for you?
(Don't know what to do)
Tick tock, steady as a clock, drip drop
I'm hopin' someday soon I'll be over you

It's a quarter after twelve
I know I should be in bed (Bed)
Boy, you got me feelin' sorry for myself (Oh, yeah)
I must confess, this loneliness is killin' me (I'm so upset)

How could you break all your promises?
Like how you told me you'd be there to hold me
I cannot believe the way I fell for it
I was a fool to buy all the lies you sold me

Drip drop
When will my tear drops stop fallin' for you?
(Don't know what to do; fallin' for you)
Tick tock, steady as a clock, drip drop
I'm hopin' someday soon I'll be over you (Oh, it's true)
Drip drop
When will my tear drops stop fallin' for you?
(Don't know what to do)
Tick tock, steady as a clock, drip drop (Oh, yeah)
I'm hopin' someday soon I'll be over you

Maybe we were never meant to be
I'm sorry that it took so long for me
To see what's happenin'
You come around and then it rains again (Again, again)
Drip drop (Oh, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
When will they stop?
Drip drop
When will my tear drops stop fallin' for you?
(When will they stop fallin' down?; don't know what to do)
Tick tock, steady as a clock, drip drop (Oh, drip drop)
I'm hopin' someday soon I'll be over you (Drip drop, drip drop)
Drip drop
When will my tear drops stop fallin' for you?
(Don't know what to do; fallin' for you)
Tick tock, steady as a clock, drip drop
I'm hopin' someday soon I'll be over you

Raining, it's pouring (Oh, yeah)
I try hard ignoring these tears
I try so hard ignoring the tears
Raining, it's pouring
