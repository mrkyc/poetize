What you think about this?
I've been holdin' it in, now I'm lettin' it flow
What you think about this?
Gonna do my own thing, yeah, I'm flyin' solo, so
Don't tell me how it's gonna be
On my own, and the thing of it is
There's nothin' 'round here that I'm gonna miss

'Cause you're holdin' me down, I just wanna fly
Yeah, there comes a time
When I gotta say goodbye to the life that you see me in
Here's where I begin

And I promise myself, I ain't nobody's, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself, even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain, never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself, I'm the only one who will believe me

There's a voice in my head
Tellin' me, "C'mon, c'mon, move on"
There's a voice in my head
Tellin' me, "I know my right from wrong"
They, they say what doesn't kill you can make you strong
Now I know what it means
You can try to bend, but you ain't breakin' my dreams
You might also like
I'll be makin' mistakes
Comin' up at a loss
I'll be tumblin' down, but like MC, shake it off
I'll stay cool, 'cause I know who's boss of me, myself and I

And I promise myself, I ain't nobody's, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself, even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain, never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself, I'm the only one who will believe me

I'll keep movin', even when the beat is gone
I will, I'm on, I want
I'll keep doin' what I gotta do to carry on
And on, I will, I'm on

So don't hold me down, 'cause I'm gonna fly
Yeah, the time has come
And I gotta say goodbye to the life that you see me in
Here's where I begin

And I promise myself, I ain't nobody's, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself, even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain, never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
Promise myself, I'm the only one who will believe me
And I promise myself, I ain't nobody's, I just wanna be free
And I promise myself, even though it don't always come easy
Gonna learn from my pain, never explain
Do it my way, that's what I say
