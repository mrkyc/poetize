Yeah, yeah

I used to think bein' like you
Was the key to havin' everything, every dream come true
I used to think followin' the crowd
Was the only thing that I could do, until I found out

I'm okay (Dig it)
Sometimes you gotta do your own thing (Dig it)
Every winter turns to spring (Get it)
And everybody's got their own wings

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well, she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standin' my ground
Am who I am, and for that I'm proud
And the girl that you knew
Well, she's gone with the wind

She's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
Well, she's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
She's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
Yeah, she's gone with the wind

I'm speakin' up, my conscience is clear
And I don't care what anybody thinks, I've released that fear
And I don't have to be what you want me to be
'Cause every time I try to fit in, it feels like I'm in a prison

I'm okay (Dig it)
Sometimes you gotta do your own thing (Dig it)
Every winter turns to spring (Get it)
And everybody's got their own wings

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well, she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standin' my ground
Am who I am, and for that I'm proud
And the girl that I was
Well, she's gone with the wind

She's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
Well, she's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
She's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
Well, she's gone with the wind
One look in my eyes, and you'll see I'm different
I'm findin' myself every day
And along the way, I have changed

The little girl you knew
The one who never stood up to you
Who kept her silence too long
Well, she's gone with the wind
And now I'm standin' my ground (Standin' my ground)
Am who I am, and for that I'm proud
And the girl that you knew
Well, she's gone with the wind (Gone)

She's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
Well, she's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
She's gone (She's gone), gone (She's gone)
