Yeah, oh-oh

He sends a friend to ask me if I'm interested
I see you comin' my way with a smile
You say, "He's the guy, you caught his eye
But he's afraid to come over, he's a little shy
So, why don't you come talk for a while?"
But I see your smile, baby (The messenger may take the prize)
And you see the look in my eyes

I'd rather be with you, baby
You know what you're doin' to me (What you're doin')
Yeah, you're the one, the only one that sets it all on fire, yeah
You, baby
And I can see you wanna be with me
And now you know what I'm sayin' is true
I'd rather be with you

It's you and me
But then you call him over, and your buddy makes three
I know you're just tryin' to do right
A glance, a touch
Tryin' not to stare just a little too much
Baby, it's impossible to fight, oh-oh
Best of intentions
Do you really wanna give me away?
I'll take this moment to say

Yeah, you're the one, the only one that sets it all on fire, yeah
You, baby
And I can see you wanna be with me
And now you know what I'm sayin' is true
I'd rather be with you

I'd rather be with you, oh-oh (It's only time I'll make you mine)
I'd rather be with you, yeah, yeah (You know you can't deny me)
I'd rather be with you, oh-oh, oh (Come a little closer, baby)
And tell your friend that I'm not really interested
There is nothin' more that you can do

I'd rather be with you, baby
You know what you're doin' to me (What you're doin')
Yeah, you're the one, the only one that sets it all on fire, yeah
You, baby
And I can see you wanna be with me

And now you know what I'm sayin' is true
