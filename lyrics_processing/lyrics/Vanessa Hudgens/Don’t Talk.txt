Like a shooting star, you're headed for me
You've touched my heart, but I won't set it free
Oh boy, you've got to be patient with me
Oh boy, I wanna get to know you much better
Let's start it out being friends for a while
You caught my eye when I first saw your smile
Oh boy, this could really turn into somethin'
Oh boy, that's why I don't wanna rush it

Don't talk, don't tell your friends about us
Don't talk, or this all will end, I promise
Be quiet, be quiet, or I will just deny it, be quiet
Don't talk (Shh), keep it between us

I'm goin' out with a bunch of my friends
You can meet up with us a quarter to ten
Oh boy, don't act like there's somethin' between us
Oh boy, for now, let's keep it a secret

Don't talk, don't tell your friends about us
Don't talk, or this all will end, I promise
Be quiet, be quiet, or I will just deny it, be quiet
Don't talk (Shh), keep it between us
You might also like
I know we feel that this is real
But I need some time to see
If you're gonna be the one for me
For now, let's just keep it hush
Yeah, keep it between us

It looks obvious and I don't really care
'Cause people like to talk and people like to stare
But it's one thing to guess and it's one thing to know
So when it comes to us, baby, keep your mouth closed

(Don't talk) Don't talk, don't tell your friends about us (Oh, don't tell)
Don't talk (Don't tell, oh no), or this all will end, I promise
Be quiet, be quiet (Hey), or I will just deny it, be quiet
Don't talk (Shh; oh), keep it between us (Between us)
Don't talk, don't tell your friends about us (Yeah)
Don't talk (Don't talk, don't talk), or this all will end, I promise
Be quiet, be quiet, or I will just deny it, be quiet
Don't talk (Shh), keep it between us
