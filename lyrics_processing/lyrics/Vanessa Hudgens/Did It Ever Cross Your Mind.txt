Did it ever cross your mind, boy?
Did it ever cross your mind, boy?

Fears that I would face
Knowin' that I would never see your face
I miss you, baby, every day and night
It just ain't right
(Did it ever cross your mind, boy?)
You would break my heart
Knowin' that you would break this all apart
These tears of mine, I cry so hard at night (Cry, cry, cry, cry)
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind (Oh, oh)
That I'd be left behind?
Did you ever stop to think (Oh, oh)
You'd lose me in a blink?
Did it ever cross your mind? (Oh)
I thought we said for life
Did it ever cross your mind? (Oh)
No, and that just ain't right
No (Oh), no (Oh), it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right

Miss you, now you're gone
Beat down and tryin' so hard to move on
I'll face up, now I'm lyin' to myself
It just ain't right
(Did it ever cross your mind, boy?)
I've had time to think
And all my friends are watchin' as I sink (Sink, sink, sink, sink)
Nothin' no one can do to help
It just ain't right

Did it ever cross your mind (Oh, oh)
That I'd be left behind?
Did you ever stop to think (Oh, oh)
You'd lose me in a blink?
Did it ever cross your mind? (Oh)
I thought we said for life
Did it ever cross your mind? (Oh)
No, and that just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right

Now you're gone
I'm tryin', tryin' to move on
Now you're gone
I'm tryin', tryin' to move on
Now you're gone
I'm tryin', tryin' to move on
Now you're gone
Did it ever cross your mind, baby?
Did it ever cross your mind (Oh, oh)
That I'd be left behind?
Did you ever stop to think (Oh)
You'd lose me in a blink?
Did it ever cross your mind? (Oh)
I thought we said for life
Did it ever cross your mind? (Oh)
No, and that just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right

No, no, it just ain't right
No, no, it just ain't right
