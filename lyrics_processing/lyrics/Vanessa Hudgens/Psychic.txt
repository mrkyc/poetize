Sometimes I feel his love, sometimes I don't
There's times when he proves it, and times when he won't
It's time I know the deal 'bout how he truly feels
I guess what's killin' me is just not knowin'

My friends all tell me maybe I should seek a psychic
They tell me, "Just beware," I may or may not like it
But either way, I know I need to get some answers
About where I stand with him

How do I know? (I need to know)
I need to know

If he's for real, won't you please let me know?
Or is he just playin'? Let your magic card show
Somethin' 'bout when he's here makes me not see so clear
Does your crystal ball show any lovin' at all?

My friends all tell me maybe I should seek a psychic
They tell me, "Just beware," I may or may not like it
But either way, I know I need to get some answers
About where I stand with him
You might also like
How do I know? (I need to know)

I know this must seem so desperate
But desperate's what I've become
I'll do anything to know I'm the only one
Anything to get the truth from you

My friends all tell me maybe I should seek a psychic
They tell me, "Just beware," I may or may not like it
But either way, I know I need to get some answers
About where I stand with him
My friends all tell me maybe I should seek a psychic
They tell me, "Just beware," I may or may not like it
But either way, I know I need to get some answers
About where I stand with him

How do I know? (I need to know)

How do I know? (I need to know)
