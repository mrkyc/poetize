I thought I had control
But I slipped, and I don't, and I don't know where to go
I thought I knew it all
But all I do is think about the next time I see you
I thought I had control
But we kissed, and I slipped, and I don't know where to go
All I really know, it's getting too emotional

When you came to me
Yeah, I thought you'd be like every other guy that I'd ever met
We'd hang for a while, then I'd soon forget you
But this is something new
I was not prepared to wonder where you are when you're not with me
This feels so crazy

I thought I had control
But I slipped, and I don't, and I don't know where to go
I thought I knew it all (Knew it all)
But all I do is think about the next time I see you
I thought I had control
But we kissed, and I slipped, and I don't know where to go (Before it came)
All I really know, it's getting too emotional
You might also like
It's a strange feeling to care about someone
I guess I never did 'til I met you, boy
How was I to know how you would affect me?
Friends say I talk too much
I talk too much about you
The definition of bein' out of control
And I don't wanna feel this anymore

I thought I had control (I did)
But I slipped, and I don't, and I don't know where to go
I thought I knew it all (Knew it all)
But all I do is think about the next time I see you
I thought I had control
But we kissed, and I slipped, and I don't know where to go
All I really know, it's getting too emotional

I get this feeling inside my heart when you come around
And when we're apart, then I feel so torn up inside
I've gotta get control of my life

I thought I had control (I did)
But I slipped, and I don't, and I don't know where to go
I thought I knew it all (Knew it all)
But all I do is think about the next time I see you
I thought I had control
But we kissed, and I slipped, and I don't know where to go (Before it came)
All I really know, it's getting too emotional
