All I want is to be a part of your weekend
All I need is a little bit of your time
Baby, I'm your girl, and I need some attention
When you ignore me, I just lose my mind

I ain't gon' bug about you goin' out last night
'Cause, oh, baby, I know that I'm the only one in your sight
But please, don't tell me nothin'

I don't wanna know what you did last night
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time
I don't wanna know if it's all real or a lie, yeah
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there
I don't wanna know about the other girls there
I just wanna know when you're around, you're mine

Na-na-na-na-na-na (Uh-huh), na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na

I don't think that I'm bein' obsessive
I don't think that I'm bein' out of line
You got your space and I get to be selfish
You get yours, baby, and I get mine

I'm doin' just fine as long as we see eye to eye (You with me?)
And no, no
Ain't nothin' wrong with goin' out and havin' a good time
But I don't wanna know nothin'

I don't wanna know what you did last night
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time
I don't wanna know if it's all real or a lie, yeah
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there
I don't wanna know about the other girls there
I just wanna know when you're around, you're mine

At home, I picture you out meetin' someone new
Baby, got my mind goin' wild (Got my mind goin' wild)
I know your love is true, but what's a girl to do?
All I need is a sign (God, give me a sign)
'Cause I get jealous
Oh, baby, I get jealous
Oh, so jealous
Don't mess me up with whatever went down
I don't wanna know what you did last night (Oh, I don't wanna know)
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time (I don't wanna hear about it)
I don't wanna know if it's all real or a lie (Ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there (Don't wanna feel it)
I don't wanna know about the other girls there
I just wanna know (I just wanna know) when you're around, you're mine (You're mine)

Na, na-na-na-na-na-na (Oh, baby), na-na
