All I wanna do is stand close to you
All I wanna do is stand close to you

I'll be the one to tell everyone I'm gone
I've fallen into a place I can't begin to understand
I'm just happy you're here to hold my hand

All I wanna do is stand close to you
Be by your side
All I wanna do is make the world revolve
Around you and I
What I would give up, what I would go through
To get it right
All I wanna do in this lifetime
Is make you mine
All I wanna do in this lifetime
Is make you mine

My secret's out, it's been hidden in my heart
But that's over now, I want everyone to know I found it all
You're the everything I never had
And baby, I got it bad (Got it so bad)
You might also like
All I wanna do is stand close to you
Be by your side (Be by your side)
All I wanna do is make the world revolve
Around you and I (Oh, yeah)
What I would give up, what I would go through (Go through)
To get it right
All I wanna do in this lifetime
Is make you mine
All I wanna do in this lifetime
Is make you mine

And it's far too hard to see (To see)
What the future will be
But everywhere I go (Everywhere I go)
Everywhere I go, I know you're with me

Make you mine
Yo (All I wanna do is stand close to you)
Make you mine (All I wanna do is stand close to you)

All I wanna do is stand close to you
Be by your side
All I wanna do is make the world revolve
Around you and I
What I would give up, what I would go through
To get it right
All I wanna do in this lifetime (All I wanna do)
Is make you mine (Is make you mine)
All I wanna do in this lifetime
Is make you mine
