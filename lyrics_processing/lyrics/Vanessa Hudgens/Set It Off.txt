Your strategy's no mystery
I know you're schemin' on me
Yeah, boy, you're schemin' on me (Uh-oh)
I know your plot on what I got
Your red dot is on me
You're like a SWAT team on me (Uh-oh)

Now this mami don't come that easy
My security's tighter than Fort Knox (Uh-oh)
Got chains all over like Houdini
And there's no key, you gotta pick the lock (Uh-oh)

Come and trip my wire, trigger all my sirens
I'm on red alert, you set it off
C'mon and disarm me
Trigger my alarm, it's goin'
You set it off (Uh-oh)
Set it off

Beyond a doubt, you staked me out
You got the blueprints on me
You're plannin' a "B" and "E" (Uh-oh)
I play to win, I'm zeroed in
I got you locked in my sight
Infrared vision at night (Uh-oh)

Trigger my alarm, it's goin'
