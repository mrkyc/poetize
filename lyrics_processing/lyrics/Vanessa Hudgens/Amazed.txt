When I'm all broke down
Headin' for disaster
And I'm spinnin' 'round
Tryin' to find a clue
And my head is tired
Searchin' for the answers
Can't figure out
How I'm gonna get through the next ten minutes

Baby, I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby, I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby, I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know? Oh
Baby, I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby, I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby, I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know? Oh

Oh, oh (Oh, oh), oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh (Oh, oh), oh, oh (Oh, oh)

When I'm all burnt out
Need a place to run to
No one hears me shout
Lost and all alone
And I'm losin' ground
No one understands me
Can't figure out
What I'm gonna do, 'cause I just can't take it

Oh, oh (Oh, oh; yeah), oh, oh (Little Mama, let's go)

If I could think of you and smile
Ask you, "Could you stay a while?"
Even if you gotta go
Chase your dough, that's fo'sho
It's my love you raisin'
With my heart, you praisin'
Passion, if you stayin', ain't that amazin'?
They be callin' it a phase, we gon' keep phasin'
Some don't wanna play the game, so they keep acin'
That's a loser, see, me, I'ma keep chasin'
Chasin' this dough, oh

Oh, oh (Oh, oh), oh, oh (Oh, oh)
