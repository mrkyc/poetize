Right now, here's something real lo-fi--if I could borrow a Bill Berger term--but also really good. Music from The Girly-Sound

I was talking, not two days ago
To a certain bartender I'm lucky to know
That there are so many things in this town that make me tired
And there are so many people that leave me uninspired

And he said, "You're lucky to even know me
You're lucky to be alive
You're lucky to be drinking here for free
'Cause I'm a sucker for your lucky, pretty eyes"

And I was thinking, not ten days ago
About all the famous men that I'd like to know
And I asked Henry, my bartending friend
If I should bother dating un-famous men

And Henry said, "You're lucky to even know me
You're lucky to be alive
You're lucky to be drinking here for free
'Cause I'm a sucker for your lucky, pretty eyes"

And then he said
"Do you want to be a polyester bride?
Or do you want to hang your head and die?
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale?
Do you want to pack your things and fly away from here?
Princess, do you really want to pack your things and fly away from here?"

And I was thinking, not two days ago
About a beautiful boy that I know
And I was hating him 'cause he wouldn't call me
And I was hating him 'cause he wouldn't fall for me

And Henry said, "You're lucky to even know him
You're lucky that he's alive
You're lucky that he's not smart enough to read you, yet
'Cause he'd see what a mess you are inside"

And then he said
"Do you want to be a polyester bride?
Or do you want to hang your head and die?
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale?
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here?
Princess, do you really want to flap your wings and fly away from here?
Because you've got time"
He keeps telling me, "You've got time"
But I don't believe him, "You've got time"
'Cause I'm not listening, "You've got time"
I'm too busy pushing harder
I'm too busy pushing farther away
But he keeps telling me, "Baby"
He says, "Baby
You know, you've got time"
He keeps telling me, "You've got time"
But I don't believe him, "You've got time"
'Cause I'm not listening, "You've got time"
I'm too busy pushing harder
I'm too busy pushing farther away
But he keeps telling me, "Baby"
He says, "Baby," yeah

"Do you want to be a polyester bride?
Or do you want to hang your head and die?
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale?
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here?
Princess, do you really want to flap your wings and fly away from here?
