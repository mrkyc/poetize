Call me when you think the coast is clear
I've been hiding out almost a year
Is there something wrong?
What's taking you so long?
And yeah, I know it's not easy

You said if I waited, it'd pay off
But my eyes are growing wild and my body's gone soft
Is there something wrong?
What's taking you so long?
And yeah, I know it's not easy

You said I should let go of your hand
But I don't even know if I can
You're the only one
You are the very sun to me
And you know it's not easy


Well I look at the stars and I know you're under them
I look at the books and things people are reading
I know that you've written them, too
You've got so many little things to do
But then I look at my life and I know you've forgotten
The promise you made to me, I think that's rotten
I'm hopelessly lost and there's hardly a sound anymore
Coming through that can show me around
As I'm endlessly, endlessly searching the crowd
Looking for something from you
Just one fucking measly clue
Any shitty little tip-off would do
But I'm just an ant in Alaska to you
