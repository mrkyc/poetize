Under the surface you don't know what you'll find
Hmm, until it's your time
No second chances but all we can do is try
Hmm, I made up my mind

I can't see you
But I hear your call
Baby, hold on now

We're going home
If we make it or we don't, we won't be alone
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
If you're waiting all your life, you won't ever go
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine

Some things are simple and hard to ignore
They say, hmm, the truth is like that
We're getting colder, so far from the shore
I say, hmm, the world is like that
