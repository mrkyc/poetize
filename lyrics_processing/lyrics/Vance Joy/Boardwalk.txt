Meet me at the boardwalk
I'll be there in a New York minute
And if you need the words, I'll say 'em
Say 'em, and I'll never take 'em back, no
Yeah, we could take a long walk
And get there in our own sweet time
It's hard to catch your breath in the big bad city

But we could make it all look easy, easy, yeah
We could make it all look easy, easy, yeah

If it were me
There'd be no second-guessing
If it were me
You wouldn't have to wonder
If it's worth your time
If you're even on his mind
For me, it's so instinctive just to be good to you

So meet me at the boardwalk
I'll be there in a New York minute
And if you need the words, I'll say 'em
Say 'em, and I'll never take 'em back, no
Yeah, we could take a long walk
And get there in our own sweet time
It's hard to catch your breath in the big bad city
