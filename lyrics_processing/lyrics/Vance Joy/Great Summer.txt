Coming to your house, knocking at your door
You're my first sip of wine, you cool me, cool me down

Do you know me, you know me, you know me, do you know me now?
Do you love me, you love me, you love me, do you love me now?
Oh

Left your clothes next to the bed
Some pretty pictures in my head
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away

Now I'm in the dark, I'm not so used to doubt
You're my first cigarette, cause you calm me, you calm me down

Do you love me, you love me, you love me, do you love me now?
Do you feel me, you feel me, you feel me, do you feel me now?
Oh

Left your clothes next to the bed
Some pretty pictures in my head
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away
The kid you used to be
But I know that you're still there
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away
