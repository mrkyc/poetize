One day love came knocking on my door, but I was far away
I pretended that the sound I heard was just another game

Then I looked around
And noticed pieces that were gone
You were right before me
And I couldn't see the bond

Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
I want to try to understand
Just give me nothing but one more chance
I wanna make it all right (Make it all right)
Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
I'm gonna cherish it the best I can
Just give me nothing but one more chance
I wanna make it all right (Make it all right)

And day by day I think I'll grow to change
'Cause I can't stay the same, oh-oh-ooh
I wonder why it took so long for me
To see the love was always in the way
You might also like
You were right before me
And I didn't see you there
I thought of all my feelings
Were just begging not to care

Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
I want to try to understand
Just give me nothing but one more chance
I wanna make it all right (Make it all right)
Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
I'm gonna cherish it the best I can
Just give me nothing but one more chance
I wanna make it all right (Make it all right)

I don't care what tomorrow's gonna bring
(I don't care about tomorrow)
I don't know if it's emotion or a sin
And all I need is what I've kept alive within

Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
I want to try to understand
Just give me nothing but one more chance
I wanna make it all right
Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
I'm gonna cherish it the best I can
Just give me nothing but one more chance
I wanna make it all right (Make it all right)
Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
I want to try to understand
Just give me nothing but one more chance
I wanna make it all right (Make it all right)
Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
I'm gonna cherish it the best I can
Just give me nothing but one more chance
I wanna make it all right (Make it all right)
Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
(Make it, make it all right) To try to understand
Just give me nothing but one more chance (One more chance)
I wanna make it all right (One more chance)
Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
(Make it, make it all right) And cherish it the best I can
Just give me nothing but one more chance (One more chance)
I wanna make it all right (One more chance)
Oh, will you give me just one more chance?
(Make it, make it all right) To try to understand
Just give me nothing but one more chance (One more chance)
