Can you feel me? Even tough where an a different side (oh oh)
Do you know this? What is happening
Can you realize it in front of your eyes?
This is love that I'm offering
Baby I don't come to discuss
Let me do ya, when I do ya cause I know you want me to do it
And I can satisfy
One more time, one more night
One more baby just get it in
One more night and I can do it
I can make you right
One more time, one more slide
One more cash, baby one more lie we gonna do this straight up we ain't gonna fight
Just one more, just one more night
I can see it in your eyes it's impressionism
Anybody in calling I seek one more time
I can keep you pushing up down like a plane in the sky
I can let all your dreams come true right in front your eyes
The deeper I'll go girl the more pleasure I apply
Feel rour pressure bursting like a greet from the sky
One more night, one more baby just get it in
One more night and I can do it
I can make you right
One more time, one more slide
One more cash, baby one more lie we gonna do this straight up we ain't gonna fight
Just one more, just one more night
Whisper so safely, telling she love me
Wanna care my baby
She knows me if I'm happy (Ohh man)
She make me everything I ever need
She's the one that meant for me
Sets my soul and mind blind free
I need some....
One more time, one more night
One more baby just get it in
One more night and I can do it
I can make you right
One more time, one more slide
One more cash, baby one more lie we gonna do this straight up we ain't gonna fight
Just one more, just one more night
