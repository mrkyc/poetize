You and you alone
My heart is everything
That you need
And every time I see you
I'm weak in the knees
My heart is filled with love
Baby, you are in control
And I won't do anything more
I keep on knockin' on your door
Because your lovin, it's the best

And keep you coming back to me
For more of the same treat
Give my all to you
I give you what you need
I'll fulfill all your needs
Keep you comin' back to me again
