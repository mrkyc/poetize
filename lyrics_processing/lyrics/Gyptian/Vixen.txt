Believe me!
That is the wickedest sound that play and it is the new celebrity
Along with all massive and all crew line up, them cyan get we out
When it comes to championship, it's we have it
And when it comes to dignitary, oh God, we nah talk 'bout the business, we have it very versatile when it comes to sound you cyan pass we, 'cause we have done cross the border...

Eyes so green that even diamonds couldn't shine so bright
I was lost in the darkness, but then she stole the night, woah oh
I only talk to her for maybe once or twice
Skin so golden brown, red lips with a vicious smile

She said
Gyptian before you place your hands on me
I just don't let any man take over my body
She whispers softly in my ear
I said I hear you loud and clear
You got me begging you, begging you, begging you, be-begging you
That's just something I would never do
I'm in agony, agony, agony over you
There is just something about you

How could someone you just met make you fall in love like that?
She's a vixen, got me fiending for a touch tonight
Never ever have I been so honest
Never ever have I been so blind
Never ever have I been so open
She got control, but I don't mind
You might also like
I bet her kisses taste like paradise
She warms my heart and it was cold as ice
See!
She haunts my dreams and that ain't right
Hips that shake like a mountain, she rock a grown man to sleep
Hear what I say

She said
Gyptian before you place your hands on me
I just don't let any man take over my body
She whispers softly in my ear
I said I hear you loud and clear
You got me begging you, begging you, begging you, b-begging you
That's just something I would never do
I'm in agony, agony, agony over you
There is just something about you

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ah ah, ah ah ah
She's a vixen
Got me fiending for a tou-ou-ouch
She said
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ah ah, ah ah ah
She's a vixen
Got me fiending for a tou-ou-ouch
Believe me!
That is the wickedest sound that play and it is the new celebrity
Along with all massive and all crew line up, them cyan get we out
When it comes to championship, it's we have it
