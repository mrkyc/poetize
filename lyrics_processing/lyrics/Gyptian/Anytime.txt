Never let your problems get you down
Gotta stay focused and hold your grounds
Though it seems hopeless
There is no progress
Still have to hustle round town
Do what we do just to stay alive
We sell what we sell just to survive
We tired of the fuckery and we fed up from about 95

Tell them say, anytime
Me hungry again them ago see the nine
Police outta road say them a fight crime
Corruption and war, mi say, do it this time
Tell them say, anytime
Me hungry again them ago see the nine
Police outta road say them a fight crime
Corruption and war, mi say, do it this time

A we feel the pinch now when everything spoil
Poverty and hunger anuh easy lifestyle
Tired and we tired and we tired
Bumboclaat, some man tired
Well, try nuh send no cris chrome nine into a barrel
Nine months now, and see me don't drink no sorrel
Landlord and mamma deh a courthouse a quarrell
Tired and we tired and we tired
