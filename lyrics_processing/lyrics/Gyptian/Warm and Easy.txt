Oh no, oh no no no no no
Oh no, oh no no no

Love keeps me so warm and easy
If this is not love, well yes it is
Everything comes naturally
Each time you take my breath away

It's like everything from my mind
Manifests in front my eyes
Never thought in my wildest dreams
You would be mine
I've won myself the prize of a lifetime
No need to second try
And this is forever
Now and forever
You forever by my side

Love keeps me so warm and easy
If this is not love, well yes it is
Everything comes naturally
Each time you take my breath away
You might also like
I would've never thought that love would treat me good as you
No need to do that, 
You are forever, and a keeper
And that all I'm gonna do
You're my lover, my saviour
I'm so glad to meet you

Love keeps me so warm and easy
If this is not love, well yes it is
Everything comes naturally
Each time you take my breath away

It's like everything from my mind
Manifests in front my eyes
Never thought in my wildest dreams
You would be mine
I've won myself the prize of a lifetime
No need to second try
And this is forever
Now and forever
You forever by my side

Love can be so warm and easy
If this is not love, well yes it is
Everything comes naturally
Each time you take my breath away
So natural, so naturally
You are all, you're all I ever need
You're so warm and easy, so warm and easy
 baby
Hypnotize me, so warm and easy, yeah
Take my breath away

Love keeps me so warm and easy (Just want you to know)
If this is not love, well yes it is
Everything comes naturally
Each time you take my breath away
Love keeps me so warm and easy
If this is not love, well yes it is
Everything comes naturally
Each time you take my breath away

Angel in the sky
I could tell by looking in your eyes
She just want me to fly away, fly
Just fly with me, away
