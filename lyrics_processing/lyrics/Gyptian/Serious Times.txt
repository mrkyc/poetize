And I seh
These Are some serious times
All I can see round natty is violence and crime
Full time for us to centralize socialize and realize
To let the sun shine through out every day
And let the moon shine through out the peaceful nites
This is 7 times rise and 7 times fall but I dont really believe in the falling tings at all
Cause life continues as it goes if you really want to no the true of the true isnt been told
No no no no no
