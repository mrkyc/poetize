Calling me on my phone
I tell fi ever tell dem Gyptian ain't home

And I tell my friend fi tell dem that I'm not at home
Hear they lookin' for me
While I'm over here lookin' at dem
I saw their wonderin' where I am
While I'm at the studio buildin' new song
I said they want I to be their man
But they're not the same age as I am
So school girl
