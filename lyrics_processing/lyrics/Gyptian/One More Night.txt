Summer morning
Summer nights, yeah
Love, lo-lo-lo-love, love, love, love, love
Lo-o-o-o-ve

Can I ask you what you doing tonight? Baby
Can you feel me? Even though we're on a different side
Do you know this? What is happening?
Can you realize in front of your eyes?
This is love I am offering
Baby I don't come in disguise
Let me do you, when I do you
Cause I know you want me to do it
And I can satisfy

One more time, one more night
One more baby, just get it in
One more night, and I can do it
I can make you right
One more time, one more slide
One more dash, baby one more lie
We gonna do this straight up we ain't gonna fight
Just one more, just one more night
You might also like
I can see it in your eyes
Your temperature's rising
And your body is calling
I seek one more time
I can keep you pushing up down like a plane in the sky
I can let all your dreams come true right in front your eyes
The deeper I go girl, the more pleasure I apply
Feel your pressure bursting like a greet from the sky

One more night
One more baby just get it in
One more night and I can do it
I can make you right
One more time, one more slide
One more dash, baby one more lie
We gonna do this straight up we ain't gonna fight
Just one more, just one more night

Whisper so safely
Tell me she love me
Wanna carry my baby?
She knows me, if I'm happy, oh man
She make me... everything I ever need
She's the one that's meant for me
Set my soul and my mind free
I need some...
One more time, one more night
One more baby, just get it in
One more night, and I can do it
I can make you right
One more time, one more slide
One more dash, baby one more lie
We gonna do this straight up, we ain't gonna fight
Just one more, just one more night

Night
Night
