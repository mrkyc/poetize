Hello?  I hear school girl callin
Callin me on my phone
I tell flavor tell them gyptian ain't home
I hear school callin, on my phone
And I tell my friend to tell them that I'm not at home
If they're looking for me, While I'm over here looking at them
I said they're wondering, where I am
While I'm at the studio building new song
I said they want I, to be their man
But they're not the same age as I am
So school girl'
(Chorus)
Gwan a school go learn di golden rule
And don make no man cum use you turn ya inna foot stool
Gwan a school and take in ya lesson well
Cuz soon you can be da manager fi Sandals hotel

Verse Two
When you check a stack, and ya hear dem whispers back
You see school girl sit down inna conductor lap
You know straight forward say dat him a feel up dat
Inna di song say dese words might sound slack
But it's di real fact, and di true reality

Bridge
Callin, oh yea, I ain't answerin, no way
Because they could be my young sister
Not my sex partner no day, no time
I said the youths are the future
So protect them from pain harm and danger
Youths are the new leaders
To become the new doctors and lawyers
I said the youths are the future to become the new doctors and lawyers
Said the youths are, Said the youths are, Are the neeew leaders oh oh ooooh
I say, So school girl'..
(Chorus)
Gwan a school go learn di golden rule
And don make no man cum use you turn ya inna foot stool
Gwan a school and take in ya lesson well
Cuz soon you can be da manager fi Sandals hotel
