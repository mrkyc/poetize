She say she'd rather did yaso
And she nah mek no joke
She say nah let go
No matter how far me go

And she nah run no joke

Tell me how you bend and move like an acrobat
When, how, tell me how you do that
Baby, now I see you move like a gymnastic
And your moves are fine and fantastic
Right now girl, your body is incredible
Spin on my own like a turntable
You transform and give me the drop and whine
