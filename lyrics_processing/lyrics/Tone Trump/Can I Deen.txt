Muslim Don Family
Free Kill King
Want for your brother what you want for yourself
Want for you sister what you want for yourself
A Key, I got it

A rapper and a shooter like Chi-Ali
A hustler and a Muslim like Sheikh Ali
(Wallahi!)
West side king I don't need an ID
(West Side!)
They killed my lil cousin, damn PIP
Peace in paradise
I'm on the block like a pair of dice
I treat their Prada's like a pair of Nikes
I'm Ramadan sober, I got my bares right
(Mashallah!)
Black kufi, black dickies, that's what I wear at night
I did it for the fam, I ain't stingy
My wife want properties, my son want Balencis
Two thousand for the jeans
The thobe custom Fendi
While Meek was chasing his dreams
I was chasing basenji

Bird Gang I'm like the Jimmie of my city
Black excellence
I'm like the Diddy of my city
West Philly, I'm the mayor around there
Watch your body you could get air brown there

I'm on my deen my nigga
I know some rich Muslims keep prayer rug in the back of the Rolls Royce nigga
Prayer rugs on the yacht
What's up nigga, East side blood, you know how we do it

Nigga leaves his gun in his car when he jump out go to the mosque and pray
He got OPS so coldly his excuse to use his mask and pray (You hear that?)
The imam gon' tell you the same thing that the pastor say
I got a Muslim brothers want me to take my Shahada just like Cassius Clay
(Wallahi!)
Lord forgive us since we've been out here getting cash off ye'
I've been lost in the streets like Tom Hanks in Castaway (Save me)
Fucking pretty bitches tryna put pay crash and stay
And every night I swear you could hear blast the K
We got whips and chains but we ain't listening to what the master say
I'm a NO LIMIT soldier I've been listening to Master P
Wallahi I'm grateful, I still give thanks when I break fast
Catch me at the light you could see Ferrari on my brake pads
I'm on my deen, prayer rugs on the back of the Wraith
I keep a 40-cal that be stashing back of the safe
Listen! scary moment if I'm every cracking a safe
I know I got one to the head
I got in the head that's in the back of the safe
