Don't call ass on me, man
I can't get the price or the quality anywhere else
Why do you come to me with all this shit
...after all I've done for you?
I done told you I'm getting out of this business
I thought you'd do it for me, man
I've been washing your wheel
I've run errands for you ever since I was a kid
You were always the man
Who the hell else could I go to?
 Tone Trump
They gon' make me catch a body
(Everyday I make dua's for my ahki's in them cells)
Stop all that Wallahi!
Everyday, every night big up MDF

It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in the million dollar studio laying my vocals
(Wallahi!)
Do Chanel on the thobe got the drip in a chokehold
Raised a million out in Africa, ain't no way I'm local
If it wasn't for the 'Gram, I'd never be social
Bucha grown ass boys, you niggas emotional
Shit, you a YouTube nigga
You lucky I'm deen'in, the old me would shoot you nigga
Whether you with your mama, I'm a new coupe nigga
Rapping, acting, shit, I'm the new Snoop nigga (Believe that)
Baby blue Prada, those for Nipsey (Nip!)
Twenty thousand stuffed in my dickies
(Wallahi!)
Is he blood? Is he Muslim?, stop backbiting (Stop it)
Felt back for a minute now I'm back writing (I'm back)
All white Porsche with black lightning (Beam!)
Her baby father got book now she back indicting
I got ahki's in the mountains and they ain't hiking
My younglings goin' to war and they ain't fighting
Balenciaga thobe changed the game up (Drip!)
Made a million from the mud we came up

My enemies loose lips nigga how to hurt me
My weapons help prosper
So when they try the shit don't be working
Living and learning
Back the fifth off the turban
I hit a buck off the speed limit in a V-12 and I'm swerving
 Thegoboyko (Tone Trump)
These niggas be all cap (They gon' make me catch a body)
Don't be thinking they really tough
They just talk that (Stop all that Wallahi!)
Yeah-yeah
These niggas be all cap (They gon' make me catch a body)
Don't be thinking they really tough
They just talk that (Stop all that Wallahi!)
Yeah-yeah

Look, I'm like Ma$e but for the churches
I put my heart into these verses
I was raised on the sunnah and the G-code
Bulletproof vest under Burberry pea coat
My camel tied and I'm sprayed up
Ghea! West Philly stars Dope Boys raised
There's tray-8 and razors
Four pounds and gauges
Jai Claire flavors, shooting like a Laker
I'm looking like Faloose, you looking like a hater
The younglings wanna be us, the FEDS wanna raid us
Praying to Allah for another day
Have supper and ask 'em for another way
My enemies loose lips nigga how to hurt me
My weapons help prosper
So when they try the shit don't be working
Living and learning
Back the fifth off the turban
I hit a buck off the speed limit in a V-12 and I'm swerving
