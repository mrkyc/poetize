You criticize but your kids they look up to us
MDF we the Mob, y'all know what's up with us
Tattoo tears I'm all cried out
New laws from the 'burbs that's the hideout
A unique thobe Franck Muller and some Yeezy slides
54th street where they let them heaters fly
We survived wars I need a Purple Heart
They killed my brother B'ak man that hurt my heart
Master street legend throw your M's up
Free the ahk's keep your spirits and ya chins up
Bulletproof windows on the Benz truck
All white buffs ice the lens up
 Avery the Artist
Mistakes are never made without the lesson
No diamonds ever made without the pressure
That's why we pray...
That's why we pray to the Mecca, Mecca
And everyday we wake up is a blessing
This dunya we live in like a treasure
That's why we pray...
That's why we pray to the Mecca, Mecca

Balenciaga tee is such a waste of money
I heard homie was a rat ya still embracing money?
He need his honors snatched, call earner up
I got my chains out and my burner tucked
Ascribing Muslim but I'm far from perfect
Yeah I'm moving cautious but I'm far from nervous
We all strapped up, allegedly!
Me no speak no English when they question me
Yeah Allah protect me from the evil eye
Louis thobe new kufi baby keep the vibe
COVID goin' crazy but we still outside
We don't turn the other cheek the whole team ride
