Jenny's daddy was five years gone
By the time that Jenny was six years old
It was her and her mom and her parakeet Pete
In a little blue house at the end of the street
Her friends ask her what her daddy did
And you know how it is when you're just a kid
She couldn't tell 'em that she didn't know
So Jenny just lied and told 'em

He's a cowboy ridin' the range
He's got a painted pony with a flowin' mane
And he's chasin' the sun, dodgin' the rain
And he don't go runnin' away when it gets tough
He's made of that stuff
That don't let you down, boy
No, he's a cowboy
He's a cowboy

Ten years later after a pillow fight
Well, Jenny and her friends got to talkin' 'bout life
What they're gonna do when they graduate
What kind of guy they're gonna marry one day
And all of her friends said the usual stuff
You know, doctors and lawyers and bankers and such
But Jenny didn't even bat an eye
When she started talkin' about her dream guy
You might also like
He was cowboy ridin' the range
He's got a painted pony with a flowin' mane
And he's chasin' the sun, dodgin' the rain
And he don't go runnin' away when it gets tough
He's made of that stuff
That don't let you down, boy
No, he's a cowboy
He's a cowboy

Jenny married a guy named Mike
And they had a little boy and they started a life
But Mike ran off four years ago
And now her little boy is five years old
And Jenny looks out the window with a smile
At the way life works when you give it a while
Little man runnin' 'round out back
With a stick horse and a little red hat

He's a cowboy ridin' the range
He's got a painted pony with a flowin' mane
And he's chasin' the sun, dodgin' the rain
And he don't go runnin' away when it gets tough
He's made of that stuff
That don't let you down, boy
No, he's a cowboy
Yeah, he's a cowboy
