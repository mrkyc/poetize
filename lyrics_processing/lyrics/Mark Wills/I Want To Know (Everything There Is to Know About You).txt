What stations are the buttons on your radio on?
Do you sleep late Saturdays or get up at dawn?
Do you prefer fiddles or violins?
And have you given any thoughts to how a lifetime of love begins?

I want to know everything there is to know
About what turns you on what you like and what you don't
Tell me all your secrets, all your hopes and wishes too
I want to be everything you ever want
So I'm gonna need something to go on
I mean to make your every dream come true
So I want to know everything there is to know about you

Do you like walking underneath the moonlight?
Is there some kind of magic that'll make the mood right?
How many kisses? How many stars?
I'm determined to keep trying 'til I find the way to your heart

I want to know everything there is to know
About what turns you on what you like and what you don't
Tell me all your secrets, all your hopes and wishes too
I want to be everything you ever want
So I'm gonna need something to go on
I mean to make your every dream come true
So I want to know everything there is to know about you
You might also like
The serious stuff and the light-hearted
I look in your eyes and I'm just getting started

I want to know everything there is to know
About what turns you on what you like and what you don't
Tell me all your secrets, all your hopes and wishes too
I want to be everything you ever want
So I'm gonna need something to go on
I mean to make your every dream come true
So I want to know everything there is to know about you
