In a dim-lit parkin' lot
They file in at 6 o'clock
Down on Madison Avenue
In black shades and BMWs, uh-huh
They cover tattoos with their long sleeves
And hide their skull cans underneath the seat
Then they walk through the door
Down the stairs to a circle of foldin' chairs and they sit down
And old boy says, 'Welcome y'all, who wants to start us off?"

Stand up, give your first name
Go on, speak up, don't be ashamed
If you're a hick, son, start confessin' the life you've kept hidden
Knowin' that deep down you're one of us
Welcome to the weekly meeting of Rednecks Anonymous

Charlie took the floor, said call him Chuck
Said he hates his car and wants a monster truck
With a cattle guard and a gun rack
Then he sat down and everybody clapped, uh-huh
Then Mary Beth broke down
Said last night, she went downtown
Said she danced up on a barstool
Even sang karaoke and rode the bull and got bucked off
Lee leaned over and hugged her neck, and said, "All right, who's next?"

Welcome to the weekly meeting of Rednecks Anonymous

And he said, "You know what? I've heard enough
Ain't nothin' y'all need to recover from
Stop livin' life, take some pride, and take the twelve steps
On down the street, to the corner bar
Who's comin' with me?"

Come on, stand up, give your first name
Go on, speak up, don't be ashamed
If you're a hick, son, start livin' thatlife you've kept hidden
I'm so glad to know you're one of us
And I never wanna see you at another meeting of Rednecks Anonymous
