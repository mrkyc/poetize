3 AM on the clock
Lullaby, music box
Oh, baby, please don't cry
Let's let mama sleep tonight
You've only been home one day
You don't even know your name
Tiny hand on my cheek
You're a miracle to me
In the stillness of the night
Cradled in this rocking chair
I hold all my hopes and dreams
Every single answered prayer

In my arms
Wish I could hold you forever
In my arms
I will give you shelter
Still I know I can't always be there
To protect you from this great big old world
But I swear this much is true
There'll always be a place for you in my arms

As I watch you take each breath
Oh, it scares me to death
To know you're counting on me
To be the daddy that you need
Wounded knees and broken hearts
Learning how to drive a car
When it's time for your first date
Will I know just what to say
And when you find that one true love
I'll put on my best smile
And I'll try to hide my tears
As I walk you down the aisle
You might also like
In my arms
Wish I could hold you forever
In my arms
I will give you shelter
Still I know I can't always be there
To protect you from this great big old world
But I swear this much is true
There'll always be a place for you in my arms
Wish I could hold you forever
In my arms
Oh, now I will give you shelter
Still I know I can't always be there
To protect you from this great big old world
But I swear this much is true
There'll always be a place for you in my arms

Oh, this promise I will keep
