Ah, come on
Here we go

He was an underdog, a no threat
A NASCAR junkie, a rookie, a wannabe
Still wet behind the ears
A red line baron just jammin' his gears
There are those that are and those that ain't
The quickest get stickers, he was nothin' but paint
Chartreuse paint

Then he raced, now we cut to the last ten laps
Here comes Junior, sneakin' up from the back of the pack
With fire in his eyes, wavin' out the window as he passes 'em by
The tension mounts, now he's number two
All out of rubber and runnin' on fumes
He's door to door, outta turn four
He sees those checkers and he hears that roar

And the crowd goes wild
And the crowd goes wild
You're shinnin' like a superstar, baby
And the crowd goes wild
You might also like
He played the Honky Tonks, the road sidebars
A real humdinger, a blue-eyed singer
With a red guitar around his neck
Payin' them dues 'bout stoppin' his debt
But he told his mama every time he come back
"One of these days I'm gonna buy you a big, long Cadillac
And get you outta this shack"

And then he hit the road, frontin' the band
Six long hairs bobbin' up and down
In a Chevy van, all beat up
He did a lot of givin' but he never gave up
Then one night, he wrote a song
Made a little record that started catchin' on
Now it's colosseums, he's all the rage
The lights go down when he hits the stage

And the crowd goes wild
And the crowd goes wild
You're shinnin' like a superstar, baby
And the crowd goes wild
You're shinnin' like a superstar, hey
Woo
Go
One more
Yeah, and here's the two/two to Parker
Hit high in deep to right field
Jones to the back, to the wall
Goodbye
Setup is good, kick is in the air
It's got the distance, it's good
He gets the four main front
And three wide receivers
Two to the left
He goes back to throw
Has time, to the end zone
Touchdown

And the crowd goes wild
And the crowd goes wild
You're shinnin' like a superstar, baby
And the crowd goes wild
You're shinnin' like a superstar
And the crowd goes wild
You're shinnin' like a superstar, baby
And the crowd goes wild
You're shinnin' like a superstar
You're shinnin' like a superstar, baby
And the crowd goes wild
You're shinnin' like a superstar
And the crowd goes wild
Woah
You're shinnin' like a superstar, baby
