You look so peaceful sleeping
You don't know that I'm leaving but I'm gone
Well I did my best to beat 'em, but in my head the demons said, "Move on"
When you wake up, you're gonna curse my name
But as some time goes by, I hope and pray

When you think of me (Think of me)
Remember the way that I used to be (Way that I used to be)
Remember the times I held you tenderly (Tenderly)
Remember the way that I love you

I think about the night I met you
I swore I'd never forget you, well, I won't
I think about the way you live and breathe beside my dreams forever
Well, you'll be better when I'm gone
You'll be better when I'm gone
'Cause I know you're gonna fall in love again
I'm sorry this is how it has to end

But when you think of me (Think of me)
Remember the way that I used to be (Way that I used to be)
Remember the times I held you tenderly (Tenderly)
Remember the way that I love you
Oh, when you think of me
You might also like

As I pick up these bags and turn around
I say a little prayer and hope somehow

When you think of me
Remember the way that I used to be (Way that I used to be)
Remember the times I held you tenderly (Tenderly)
Remember the way that I love you
When you think of me (Think of me)
Remember the way that I used to be (Way that I used to be)
Remember the times I held you tenderly (Tenderly)
Remember the way that I love you

Oh, when you think of me (Think of me)
When you think of me (Think of me)
When you think of me (Think of me)
