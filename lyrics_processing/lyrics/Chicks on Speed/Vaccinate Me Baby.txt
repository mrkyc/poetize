Gotta find my baby
So I can dry away these blues
She's got the right prescription
Knows just what to use
Please baby, vaccinate me from these blues

I'm lonely for you
Because you know just what to use
()
Hurry up and 
Wipe away my tears
Everyday that you've been gone just seems like years and years
Oh my baby, vaccinate me from these blues
I'm lonely for you only
'Cause you know just what to use

I don't want your money
All I want is you
Come and treat me baby
Well, you know just what to do
Please baby baby, vaccinate me from these blues
(these blues, these blues, these blues)

You're  my baby
To drive away these blues
You  the right prescription
You know just what to use
Please baby, vaccinate me from these blues
I'm lonely for you only
'Cause you know just what to use

I don't need your body
All I need is you
Come and see me baby
You know just what to do
Please please baby, vaccinate me from these blues
Lonely for you only
'Cause you know just what to use

I got two more from my baby
So I can drive away these blues
She's got the right prescription
Well, she knows just what to use
Please baby, vaccinate me from these blues
Well, I'm lonely for you only
'Cause you know just what to use
(How do I know that when I get the vaccine that Bill Gates won't insert a microchip into my arm so that he can follow wherever I go for the rest of my life?)
(Well it could be worse)
(Well good for you)
(I'll put my vaccine type in my dating profile)
(It's 94.1% effective)

I'm lonely for you only
'Cause you know just what to use
All I need is you
