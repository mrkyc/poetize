What happened to me? I'm just a girl
Only a girl wanting to be someone
And if I try, oh
And if I dream, oh
And if I see my heart inside of me

Let's go flying together
Let's go fly like a bird, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go skating the sky
To hear my voice an your cry

I just want to be free in this world
I hope that everybody understands
I just want to be free and fly away
And smell all the flowers in my heart
I want to feel the love in me
And I want to go, go, go, go, go away

I'm feeling real love only for you
You opened my eyes and I saw the world
It's time to live, oh
You can be mine, oh
And we can journey to paradise
You might also like
Let's go flying together
Let's go fly like a bird, yeah, yeah, yeah

I just want to be free in this world
I hope that everybody understands
I just want to be free and fly away
And smell all the flowers in my heart
I want to feel the love in me
And I want to go, go, go, go, go away

If I had a wing to fly
If I had a tear to cry
I would give my soul to the angels of the sky

I just want to be free in this world
I hope that everybody understands
I just want to be free and fly away
I hope that everybody understands
I just want to be free and fly away
And smell all the flowers in my heart
And I want to feel the love in me
And I want to see the liberty
To share the feelings in my heart
Ooh, ooh, what happened to me?
(Ooh, what happened to me?)
