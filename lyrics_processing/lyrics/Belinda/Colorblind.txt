Why you lookin' at me like that?
You know I'm not perfect
Don't try to color me with my past
'Cause nobody's perfect
My blood turns red, yeah exactly like yours
And hurting me now doesn't even the score
Who I've been is not who I am no more, oh

You got flaws and baby I've got mine
Million shades between black and white
Will you see me in a different light?
Can you love me, love me, love me, love me colorblind?
You got flaws and baby I've got mine
Million shades between black and white
Will you see me in a different light?
Can you love me, love me, love me, love me colorblind?

Love me (Don't shade me)

Can you love me, love me, love me, love me colorblind?

Who I am is what you believe
It's not that complicated
Stop projecting the past on me
Sorry, can't change it
You're insecure, but it's all in your head
Been fighting all night, can you love me instead?
Come on baby, take back all the shit you said, yeah

Can you love me, love me, love me, love me colorblind?
