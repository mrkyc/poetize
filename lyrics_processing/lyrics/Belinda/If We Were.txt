Maybe I'll treat you better
Maybe I'll be your friend
Maybe I'll wear your sweater
Maybe I'll find some time
To go shopping and buy you nicer clothes
'Cause the ones you've got have got to go
I'll cook your dinner, put some meat on those bones

That's the least I could do
I'd be so good for you

I'd build you up, I'll be the best, you'd have it all
If we were, if we were (If we were)
You'd never be so damn depressed
If we were, if we were (If we were)
I'd build you up, you'd never rest
If we were, if we were (If we were)
We'll be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever

Maybe I'll do your laundry
Maybe I'll scratch your back
Tell you I adore you
Make you feel like a man
And all of that, now wouldn't that be nice?
And you've got a life, wouldn't think twice
I'd drove you crazy for the rest of your life (Rest of your life)
You might also like
That's the least I could do
I'd be so good to you

I'd build you up, I'll be the best, you'd have it all
If we were, if we were (If we were)
You'd never be so damn depressed
If we were, if we were (If we were)
I'd build you up, you'd never rest
If we were, if we were (If we were)
We'll be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever

You don't realize what you're missing
All that huggin', all that kissin'
Shut up and listen to me
But we're not, I forgot

I'd build you up, I'll be the best, you'd have it all
If we were, if we were (If we were)
You'd never be so damn depressed
If we were, if we were (If we were)
I'd build you up, you'd never rest
If we were, if we were (If we were)
We'll be the most beautiful mess
If we were forever
You don't realize what you're missing
All that huggin', all that kissin'
Shut up and listen to me
