Hey girls
I have a story to tell...
Can you relate to this?

Where is my dog?
My Louis Vuitton
My Christian Dior
Where is my car?
My Gucci dress
My private jet
Where is my cash?
My credit card
My bank account
Where is my house?
Oh not just a house
My lovely mansion in Saint-Tropez

Shower me with material things
But don't you buy me all these things to get close to me
I want (I want) I need (I need)
Give me every little thing

It's never enough
You've heard it all before
It's money we adore, oh baby
It's never enough
What makes us all want more
It's never enough, oh baby

Where am I from?
Since when did i need so many things
Where are your priorities?
But i love these modern luxuries

Shower me with material things
But don't you buy me all these things to get close to me
I want (I want) I need (I need)
Give me every little thing

It's never enough
You've heard it all before
It's money we adore, oh baby
It's never enough
What makes us all want more
It's never enough, oh baby
It's never enough
You've heard it all before
It's money we adore, oh baby

What makes us all want more
(is that) It's never enough, oh baby
I want (I want) I need (I need)
Give me every little thing
I want (I want) I need (I need)
Give me every little thing
Wait girls, we don't need all these Material things
We need love, we need friendship
Oh and maybe those Mark Jacob boots

It's never enough
You've heard it all before
It's money we adore, oh baby
It's never enough
What makes us all want more
It's never enough, oh baby
It!s never enough
You've heard it all before
It's money we adore, oh baby
It's never enough
What makes us all want more
It's never enough, oh baby
