Hand me that balloon right there
Boy I used to love to do this when I was a kid
Watch this...Hey, watch this girl
Plowboy
Ain't that funny?
Plowboy
{sound of a horse neighing}
Well I'm a-packin' up my truck
An I'm a-head down south
Where real men pack their lips
With dips in their mouth
Start a moonshine still
Sleep in a tent
Buy some cheap livestock
Find some land to rent
Then I'm a Cledus T. it
Up and down the farm
With a couple of barns
A baby calf in my arms
You know I hate to brag
But I'll be tilling the most
Run a barbwire fence from post to post
Keep shells in my gun
Deer heads on my walls
Live out in the sticks and wear overalls
Why because I wanna
Find me a home in a cow town baby
Where the buffalo roam
Read the Farmer's Almanac for all the right reasons
Make sure my crop is the top for next season
Cledus T. is the farming freakazoid
Yeah I'm heading down south sugar
Because I wanna be a plowboy baby

(Sleeping at night cause I work all day)
Plowboy baby
(You can smell my pigs from a mile away)
I bet you'll hear my rooster crowing when the day begins
He goes..
(Sounds of a rooster crowing)
In lust for a hen
Home schooling, home fries, good homemade wine
We'll harvest the fields
(But not before its time)
Plant peas, and beets, green beans and rice
Haul manure from the barn to fertilize
And if the price is right
I'm gonna sell my hay boy
And let G-E-O-R-G-I-A know why they calling me
The Plowboy baby

YEAH... Cledus T. you can call me a hick
The only woman for me is a Dixie Chick
I got two billy goats
Week 'fore last
Till my snapper gets fixed
They'll be cuttin' my grass
Back hoeing, scare crowing, shoeing my horse
You know a horse is a horse
(Of Course, Of Course)
Spruce up the spread gotta make it look right
I gonna paint my barn red then paint my fence white UH!
Vidalias, tommy toe tomatoes
Irrigate some ground for my sweet potatoes
Break wild mares
Farm like Quakers
Got no love for you vegetable haters
How I'm gonna buy my seed
Sell my soul to the seed and feed
My thumb is green just like my hay bailer
Ain't no chickens in my yard keep em all in my trailer
Dog named Ol' Yeller
Kudzu is thick
I'd slop my hog but I
(Already fed it)
I'm picking off ticks, scratching poison oak
But I keep on sucking thanks to calamine lotion
(Plowboy)
Got a 4230 with my diesel whinin'
(Plowboy)
Spend all my time on a big combine
(plowboy)
Praying at night it'll rain some day
(Plowboy)
You can smell my pigs from a mile away
(Plowboy)
Got my crop laid out and the sunshine shinin'
(Plowboy)
Got an old tin still with my moonshine shinin'
