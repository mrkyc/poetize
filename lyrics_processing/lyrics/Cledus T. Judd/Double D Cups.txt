Now double D cups are utterly incredible
At Mardi Gras and Spring Break they're usually quite visible
But you there sweet lady have a good set of breasticles
Are they real? I don't have to ask
Hey double D cups may look inflatable
And whether they're paid for is often debatable
But on tons of websites they're always downloadable
As well as Kim Kardashian's Ass
Double D cups, six thousand bucks
We'll credit card 'em, go ahead and charge 'em
I love you double D cups, can't get enough
I'm glad I bought 'em, so glad I bought 'em
I like 'em in tank tops, I like 'em in sweaters
I like when they point like an Irish Settler
Double D cups have never looked better
But I can't seem to get lucky
Yeah I must admit that ladies with big 'uns
More than a few times had my name written
On them with a sharpie when they see fittin'
But they're all usually quite chubby
Double D cups, hope they don't bust
Good lordy, lordy, you're such a hottie
I love them double D cups, can't get enough
Oh what a body, oh what a body
Well, nothing against those who were not as blessed
And may never win a wet t-shirt contest
But when it comes to double D's I confess
They're the "va" in my "vavoo"
Double D cups can be saline and plastic
The bigger, the better, they sure look bootastic
And though they might make it hard to do gymnastics
I mean it when I look at them and say:
Double D cups, you're more than just jugs. Bazoons, cans, baby feeders, tata's, milkshakes, pink nose puppies, hooters, watermelons, twinner sausages, blouse bunnies. Whatever you are you're still my friends, my life long friends, both of you even the slightest small one
I love them double D cups in bras that push up
Like Dolly Pardon, like Dolly Pardon
We love those double D cups, can't get enough
They're kinda gaudy, oh what a body
