When I came across this homeboy
Said he'd fix me up real good
He led me down an alley
And right through a chain link fence
I had a hundred dollars I could spend
It was parked out in the driveway at a house of ill-repute
And in the back seat hung a double breasted lime green suit
What that homeboy showed me nearly caused a heart attack
For what he called a hooptie was a sky blue Cadillac
And I felt a little nervous as I drove out of the hood
But I loved that furry steering wheel
And that dashboard made of wood
I opened up the mini bar and in there I found a note
The stationery said County Jail and this is what he wrote
He said my nizzame is inmate Leroy Jerome
And if youse readin this judge says I isn't coming home
Though I am incarcerated I'll make a deal with you
If you can keep my gals in line this car belongs to you
Now ride low
And drive slow
And make her yours own
You'll always be riding with Inmate Jerome

And I'd tell you those old curb feelers were handy late at night
I get the feeling sometimes if I turn real quick I'd see
A gold-toothed cat daddy in the seat right next to me
One night I was hoppin and when I heard the breaking glass
And I can still remember the sounds of bullets whizzin' past
Someone said they saw a man in a fur coat and fur hat
Push me out of the motorcar and take his Caddy back
It was a young man named inmate Leroy Jerome
He's out of the joint the parole board sent him home
Yes he was incarcerated... but he cut a deal or two
Now he's got a brand new pinky ring and new Bruno Malli shoes
Hey I think I caught a whiff of Michael Jordan's splash cologne
