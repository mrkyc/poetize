Yeah what's up everybody Cledus T. Judd is back and unhealthy as ever that's right
Cledus T. Judd featuring the Ohio Kentucky West Virginia Line
That's right
Let's get it

I like my chicken fried
My potatoes pilled high
Scoop of cole slaw on the side
'Bout Joe Diffie wide
Don't bother me at all
Watchin' my cholesterol
Goin' up down up down up down
Tonight I'm gonna weigh
To see how much I gained
From the China Wok buffet
Number eight from hick-fil-a
I'll be drownin' there in sweat
From that stair step
Goin up down up down up down

I'm just chokin' it down here at chicken chief
Pourin' on them pounds of that brown gravy
Dessert and a jug of sweet tea
I turn it up down, up down, up down
You might also likeI'll eat all I can and take home the rest
I can burn it off in 30 minutes
On my treadmill ketamine pills
My weights goin' up down up down up down

Beer, or make it a six pack
Haha

Yeah them hotdogs hit the spot
Them doughnuts were nice and hot
But that chili in the crock
Is gonna have me on the pot
Gonna spend all night with the bathroom light
Flippin' up down up down up down

I'm just scarfin' it down here at freezy queen
Hell with that doctor and an EKG
Blizzard Oreos cookies
Don't turn it up down up down up down
I'll eat all I can and I'll save the rest
Try to burn it off in 20 minutes
On my treadmill phentermine pills
My weights goin' up down up down up down
Yeah I need a two all the way
Yankee dog a  sandwich
I'll need a dessert
I'll need a cotton toppin'
And I'll need you to charge it to someone else 'cause I ain't got no money to pay for it
You know what I'm talkin' about
That will be 9.45 sir thank you

Had my 405 checked yesterday
It's goin' up down up down up down

But I'm just chokin' it down here at the meat and three
Couple quarter pounders packin' on lb's
Brain freeze from that flurry
I turn it up down, up down, up down
I eat all I can 'til I'm tight in the chest
And burn it off in 10 minutes
On my treadmill phentermine pills
