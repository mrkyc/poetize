Let's get jiggy with it
Uh OHHH
My front won't crank
I owe the bank
I'm gonna pay em back but right now I can't
My record went gold half a million sold
My wallet was fat
But I spent all that
(All that)
Just when I bought
Things I couldn't afford
Now Uncle Sam's knocking on my door
All that stress I'm so depressed
Do not mess with the IRS
Loan shark says its time to pay
Says I got till the end of the day
Nothing left to do but pray
Pray
(He'll)
Give
(Me)
One more day
You might also likeShania I'm broke
I need help right away
I blew what little bit of money I made
You and me where on C.M.T
So why can't I seem to make ends meet
Radio Shack keeps a billing me
They say their gonna repo my color TV
Pick up the phone
Throw the man a loan
Say
(You'll)
Pay
Shania I'm Broke
I'm poor as hell
Can't ya tell
That's why I've got my house for sale
I try in vain
But it's not the same
I just can't emulate Mutt Lange
Have you got a place that I can stay
Maybe just for a couple days
Check with Mutt see if it's ok
Say
(The)
Word
(I'm)
On my way
Shania I'm broke
And I need a pay day
If you got an extra million send a little my way
If Shania was mine didn't make me a dime
So I had to steal your song just one more time
Look-y who's back it's Cledus T
I know ya thought you'd heard the last of me
This ain't no joke
Your my only hope
Pay
(To-)
Day
Shania I'm broke
Aww write a check will ya
Hey Shaina I tell ya what I'll do if ya let me borrow $135 dollars
To pay my stretch Yugo payment
I'll give you four free hair cuts and a bang trim
And even sing backgrounds on your next record
(HEY-EY-EY)
Shania I'm broke
I'm ashamed to say
That Super Bowl bet didn't go my way
Won't ya please buy my new CD
Or I'll be filing bankruptcy
All my creditors are suing me
I owe back taxes from 93
I know your home so pick up the phone
Pay
Me today
Shania I'm broke
I'm broke
