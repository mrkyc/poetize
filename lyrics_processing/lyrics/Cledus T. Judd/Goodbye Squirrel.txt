Set in our backwoods ways
Both members of the huntin' club
Both active in the NRA -Nation Redneck Association
We scouted a location where we had no doubt
We'd kill the biggest buck in the world-about a 34 pointer
Harold waited in his tree stand but all he seen was a squirrel
Dang near two weeks since the the season started and
Neither one of us was amused
We had a on real tree camo, high-powered ammo
But no big game to shoot
Then we finally saw a deer as big as a horse
Harold had it in his cross-hairs
But that squirrel jumped off a branch above us and
Landed in Harold's hair
Harold fell off the stand, on his head he landed
Like a wimp he laid there he cried
Till I climbed on down, picked him up off the ground
And it didn't take us long to decide...that squirrel had to die
HA ha ha ha ha ha ha
Good-bye squirrel-with black-eyed peas
Your gonna taste good to me-squirrel
It's you or me
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Come on out of that tree-squirrel
Hey guess what-You've eaten your last nut-squirrel
You might also likeMe and Harold went down to the surplus store
Bought a keg of dynomite
Two baseball bats and a case of M80's
We were in for one heck of a fight-we'll show you
When your huntin' with dumb and dumber
Somethings surely bound to go wrong-now be careful
And when Harold lit that real short fuse
I knew it wouldn't be long
When the dynamite blew
Harold's foot did too
And fingers began to fly
We were barely alive when the Game Warden 'rived
And much to our suprise, that squirrel didn't die
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Good-bye squirrel
Just one more shot, you'll be in my crock pot-squirrel
You'll make a lunch, you over grown chipmunk-squirrel
I'll skin your hide
And make a hat when it's dried-squirrel
