A Fella can't get no rest around this joint
Well, she got up this mornin' at 6 a.m
She was as grumpy as can be
Not a snowballs chance of sleepin' late
'Cuz she started vacuuming
Said: "Get your lazy butt up Cledus
You gotta take me to the mall
Don't forget to bring them credit cards
'Cuz I'm a'gonna use 'em all"
Wives do it all the time
We can't meet all their demands
A bunch of female General Schwarzkopfs
A'barkin' off their commands
They spend all our money it's a mystery
How us menfolk can survive
Oh why do we can't tell if they break a nail
Wives do it all the time
Oh, her makeup's scattered all over the place
& the bathrooms a cloud of dust
Didn't leave no gas in my pick up
& she hates the way I get my hair cut
You know you sure are a cold one baby
You get green with jealousy
When I steal your Victoria Sacret
Or what Mindy on CMT
You might also likeWives do it all the time
We can't meet all their demands
You know they loose all their sweetness
When we give 'em that weddin' band
They spend all our money it's a mystery
How us menfolk can survive
Well they never fail to find a sale
Wives do it all the time
Well she might just get frisky tonight
So I won't get nowhere near her
& if she says: "Cledy, come on to bed"
I'll pretend I don't hear her
OOOOOO
They spend all our money it's a mystery
How us menfolk can survive
Beats all I ever saw they'll bankrupt us all
Wives do it all the time
Yeah wives do it
All the time, all the time
Wives do it
All the time, all the time
Wives do it
All the time, all the time
Wives do it
