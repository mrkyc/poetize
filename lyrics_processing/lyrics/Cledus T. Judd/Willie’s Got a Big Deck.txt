Whoa uh what time is it 6:30 in the morning my gosh...
WILLIE, Willie!!!
What are you doing over there?
Building the Taj Mahal?
It's Sunday morning!
It's 6:30!
Can't that wait till Monday?
What are you putting up over there a log cabin?
God I wish he'd move
Yeah
I bought a little house in a west side neighborhood
The girls came over to party life is good
Till Willie moved in next door and he's made my life a wreck
Now the girls are always over at Willie's cause Willie's got a big deck
WITH
A hot tub on it
And the girls really want it
There's a band playing and lots of thong bikinis
There's a barbeque grill in the corner and they're eatin' weenies
Check out the blonde on the hot tub ladder
I guess it just goes to show size does matter
Willie's got a big deck...
You might also likeI decided to get some redecoratin done
I got some plants made sure they were well hung
I thought a long hot tanning bed might do the trick
But all I got was this tan and Willie's got a big deck
WITH
Hot babes on it
And they know how to flaunt it
In those itsy bittsy teeny weeny yellow dental floss bikinis
They're drinking frou frou drinks with umbrellas and they're burning tikis
Check out the twins on the hot tub ladder
I guess it just goes to show size does matter
Cause Willie's got a big deck
Well
If you can't beat 'em might as well join 'em
And that's exactly what I did
Now me and Big Willie and I are the best of friends
And some day I'm gonna be like him
Cause Willie's got a big deck
WITH
My tanning bed on it
And the girls really want it
The hot tub's bubbling over with thong bikinis
They're funnelin beer and sippin martinis
There's a nekkid redhead everybody's staring at her
Willie showed us all size does matter
Cause Willie's got a big deck
Hey you know mine might not be as big as Willie's but it's...uh...all I got...
You know I was thinking about adding on what do they call it?
Like an add-a-deck-tomy? Whew that's a lot of wood right there...
