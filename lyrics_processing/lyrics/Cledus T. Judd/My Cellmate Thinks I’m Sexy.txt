Hi ho Silver, AWAY!
After my show, thought I'd have a little fun
Hopped on a horse: Shorty sure could run
Well, I got a butt kickin, when the police finally caught me
("Give me back my horse!!!")
Not a moment too soon, Tim McGraw jumped in
Did his best Jackie Chan, caught a cop on the chin
Now I don't understand why they's arrestin' me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy, I really turn him on
He's always staring at me, oh, when the guards are gone
I'm runnin out of cigarettes; he's askin me to dance
He says I'm lookin good in these orange pants
I really wish Tim McGraw was here to protect me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
I'd give anything to be back on my bus
I'm hidin' in my bunk, but he's climbin' on up
Swears all he wants me to do is sing him one of my songs
Says he's got a dream: I'm afraid of what it is
You're never gonna see me on a horse after this
I only get one call. I hope that Faith is home
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy, he just won't leave me alone
He's blowin' kisses at me, and I'm a'duckin' em all
I hate to break it to him, I'm in no mood for romance
What part of no don't this fool understand?
I'm in big trouble if someone don't come and get me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy

'Cos when I drop that show gold, man his eyes light up
My cellmate thinks I
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy, I really turn him on
My name is Kenny Chesney, this ain't where I belong
Me and Tim's in trouble, buddy, one thing is for sure,.
George Strait's gonna kick us off his George Strait tour
I'd call Tracy Lawrence but he's in the next cell beside me
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
My cellmate thinks I'm sexy
I had him from hello...hello...hello
