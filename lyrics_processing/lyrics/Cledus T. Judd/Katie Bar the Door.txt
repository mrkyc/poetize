Out on that sawdust floor
That later on that evening
It be Katie bar the door
No wedding band was a showin
But I wasn't looking too hard
The next thing I knew we pulled up to the Blue Moon trailer park
She poured us a double
Then she pulled the shades on down
And I was in hog heaven
Till I started lookin around
I saw cigars in the ashtray
Then I saw an old twelve gauge
Then I heard his truck come a driving up
And I can see myself blown away
OH
Katie bar the door
Is that your husband coming home
(I think he's here)
I took it for granted
You were living here alone
(What am I going to do???)
I don't think he'd believe me no matter what I said
Katie bar the door hide me underneath the bed
You might also likeCause he came in about half drunk
And thank God he didn't see
My red underwear on the rabbit ears
Of that black and white TV
I's under the bed all doubled up
And my kidneys about to bust
The dust fell off that box springs
As those two fell into lust
Huh huh hoo hoo hoo hoo
I laid real still the morning came and he went on off to work
And she leaned over that Posturepedic
With that I still want you flirt
A sane man would have went on home
But that's something I ain't never been
Somehow the day just slipped away
Katie there he is again
OH NO
Oh
Katie bar the door
Is that your husband coming home
(I'm in a mess)
I took it for granted
You were living here alone
(He's got a gun)
I don't think he'd believe me no matter what I said
(It's LOADED)
Katie bar the door hide me underneath the bed
Katie Katie Katie
Baby what we gonna do
I got my pants on backwards and I'm looking for my boots
You can tell him I'm your brother tell him I'm a bookie
Or that I'm a den scout mother selling Girl Scout cookies
Baby find me a wig high heel shoes
Say I'm ugly aunt Eunice from Baton Rouge
Honey honey honey
Finally what a man will try
When he's underneath his death bed fearing for his life
Oh
Katie bar the door
Is that your husband coming home
(Where's my keys)
I took it for granted
You were living here alone
(Oh they're in my britches)
I don't think he'd believe me no matter what I said
(Where's my britches)
Katie bar the door hide me underneath the bed
Katie Katie Katie
