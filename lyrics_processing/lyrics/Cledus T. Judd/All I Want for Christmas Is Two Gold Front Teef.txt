Uhh

All I want for Christmas is two gold front teeth(What?)
Two gold front teeth with a diamond in each
I'd be a G if I could have two front teeth
That I'd wish you a funky Christmas (Christmas)

Well, it's Christmas and I'm toothless (Ho ho)
I got a cap in my grill that's ruthless (Ho ho)
I need a dentist that's both a driller and a jeweler (Ho ho)
I'm lookin' for a look that's just a little bit cooler (Ho ho)
I don't want toys I don't want any money (Ho ho)
I want my carats in my mouth of Bugs Bunny (Ho ho)
This year the only thing on my list
Is two teeth to match the watch on my wrist

All I want for Christmas is two gold front teeth (What?)
Two gold front teeth with a diamond in each
I'd be a G if I could have two front teeth
That I'd wish you a funky Christmas (Christmas)

When someone says "Yo wazzup dog?"
I'll say: "You know I'm doin my plug fizzle
(Right on)
A real OG like ODB
My record sales will triple"

Better wrap it up put it underneath the tree (Ho ho)
I want a million dollar smile like Master P (Ho ho)
I'll keep them shinin' like the doves on my dually (Ho ho)
Santa Claus won't you please bring him to me
