And what about you Cledus?
CLEDUS
Well Santa
It's not what I want
It's what I want to give...
It's Christmastime in Nashville for country singers one and all
I'm going to give a right nutty party
It's Cledus' Christmas Ball
You might also likeI sent out the invitations
Heck I even rented out the hall
And I've got a big SACK full of presents
Male CHORUS
Cledus' Christmas ball...
Dolly Parton brought two JUGS
(*wolf whistle*)
Of wine everyone admired
Montgomery Gentry spiked the eggnog
Female chorus
Chestnut's roasting on an open fire
Somebody get Mark off of there
Ah the twin fiddles are playing'
And it's a sewingin' time for all
YEE HAW
Everybody's dancin' around
Male CHORUS
Cledus' Christmas ball
HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO
Shania'a under the mistletoe
And that line was slap down the hall
Boy I hope she enjoys kissin'
Male CHORUS
Cledus' Christmas ball
Willie Nelson's homemade brownies
Brought us all good cheer
Garth retired early again
CHORUS
But he'll be back next year
You can count on THAT
The party's dyin' down now
So here's my present to you all
Haha
Come check out MY package
Male CHORUS
Cledus' Christmas ball
It's a little bitty piece of me to you
Male CHORUS
Cledus' Christmas ball
CHORUS
It's an ornament for your Christmas tree
Cledus' Christmas
