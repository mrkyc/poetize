Just why we have come together as one
There are rumors flying
Even LaToya's psychic line
Could not predict that you would marry me
**Take it Lisa Marie
+You couldn't go on pretending day by day
That you were really the King
You're more feminine than me
From plastic surgery
And Liz was old and overweight so you chose me
We own the world we got gazillions
*You wear the pants I'll wear the glove and LOVE the children
+I'll teach you scientology
Move to Memphis Tennessee
*I swear we're gonna have more clout than Bill and Hillary
*Oh Priscilla was mad
She said your dad
Was weird enough
You might also like+But even Elvis didn't try to buy the elephant man
*He gave away big Cadillacks
Ate cheeseburgers by the stacks
+And left me a bloody fortune no you get half
We own the world that's why we're grinning
And if you hear a whirling sound it's Elvis spinning
+Ah he's turning over in his grave
His face has turned blue suede
*And if he ain't really dead this'll kill him now
+We haven't kissed so far we've just held hands
The only ride you've given me was at Disneyland
*Waa waa wellllllllll there's people suing
Oh they're trying to make me pay
I've had to hire more lawyers than OJ
We own the world
Neverland and Graceland
Bubbles the Chimp can have the jungle room to play in
+I'll learn to do the moonwalk too
*And if my nose should come unglues
Or my hair should catch on fire you'll come to my rescue
We own the world
+He loves me tender
Even though I'm still not sure about his gender
*I guess that I'm a cross between Janet and Jermaine
+And I'm a hunka hunka burnin' love straight from the King
Ooo
**Lisa Marie when do you think we can uh constipate our marriage
++Well as soon as ya stop grabbing yourself honey
**Ha ha ha oh Lisa Marie you're such a Thriller
++Aw thank you
Thank you very much
