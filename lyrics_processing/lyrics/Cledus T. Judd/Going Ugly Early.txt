You know a metting market, where you pick up chicks
Well knowing Bobby Ray as i do, He'll be goin home alone before the night is through
He's just too darn picky, he's always wantin to score big!
Well I'm not leavin here alone, I'm gonna compromise, early on
Yea, I'm goin ugly early tonight
She may not be a beauty queen but thats alright
I'm not waitin round for one that looks good in the light
I'm goin ugly early tonight
So Bobby I says
Please dont stare, but check them 2 out standin over there
He says you mean the good lookin blonde and the one with the big zits?
I says, Yea thats right and heres my plan, im not goin for miss scandinavian, Her chubby lil friend...well thats my pick
You can drink them cute but not skinny
You get too picky, you ain't gettin any
So im goin ugly early tonight
She may not be a beauty queen but thats alright
I'm not waitin round for on who looks good in the light
Im goin ugly early tonight
Then all of a sudden to my suprise, the pretty one was givin me the eye
And i was fixin to move up from a 2 to a 10!
She said, you know i dont live to far from here
I'll get my purse and you pay for them beers
And i was feelin pretty puffed up til she turned to her friend
I guess she didn't i'd here
Them hurtful words she whispered in little chubby's ear
Yea im goin ugly early tonight
His friend is better lookin but i ain't got the time
I'm not waitin round for one that looks good in the light
She sed im goin ugly early tonight
You know she really hurt my pride but way down deep inside
