Tonight, I'm walking on air

The sun shining
Still late to the date, got fears, it appears
I can feel them subsiding
Can't see, can't hear, who is looking in the mirror?
Got age on my face and I'm feeling older
Global warming has never felt colder
It's over
Feels like these songs that I'm playing have frozen your shoulders
Look, I think that I'm losing it now
All alone in my tower, I'm passing the hours
This torch I can't ever pass down
I can't throw in the towel
Can't hand over the crown
And that's hand over fist
Mind over matter, that chatter
You're backing me into a corner
With corny ass rappers, I'm backed up and blasting
Fuck your acceptance, it's more than just rapping
Clapping for the kid, you know you gotta give
Heart is on the line, cannot be denied
Cannot be defined, hope you got it right
Shooting in the dark, trying to shed a light
Trying to tell you I ain't trying to tell you
I'm speaking the truth
Beauty is something that doesn't just happen
Beauty is something you do
That's beautiful
You might also like
Tonight, I'm walking on air

Still trying
Saw God in the face of the people
Preaching, we just want to be equal
But I've never seen somebody take shots that lethal
Kill our own people
Is it me or is murdering legal?
Fuck peaceful
Fuck your mind frame, fuck your mind state
Come to my state and see that the truth is deceitful
The prey vs. the predators
That's a tale as old as time
So you know that Imma climb
Imma prey on my competitors
Break your necklace, break necks, break bread
Break her off before breakfast
Break fast busting off in every direction
Think quick kid, here take this lesson:
The world don't move like they teach you in school
Don't let the magazines tell you whats Beautiful
Bet she never heard that growing up
All them lost boys kept showing up
Looking back I guess we never know enough
Always looking to the future, and living on the cusp
Heart upon my sleeve, believe in the love
Real life never seemed suitable
Don't complain, just engage, and change
And let's make it Beautiful
Tonight, I'm walking on air

Yeah, yeah, I know you love that
Don't act like you don't love that
Tell me baby, let me know
Do you know where this road goes?
I can only hear you through the phone, I'm honing in
Is it wrong? Is it counterproductive to make this song?
I need to know, I've been walking so long
And no matter where I go, no matter what I'm doing
This is all I'm working on
Fuck that, get in the car
We can go anywhere you want to go
Go

Wait a minute where's he going with it?
If you don't get it, need to go and get it
The attention doesn't last long
Hit a party around the block
Had to turn the Navi on
Hit the city, catch a cabby home
Catch a flight, don't keep a carry-on
I was born on a Sunday, 420 fell on Easter
The second-coming's finally coming home
We were waiting for this shit to pop
Had a conversation with my pops
For a moment I thought I was lost
97 when I saw the cops
Turn down the music hesitate to stop
I ditched the doobie, stash was in my sock
Pull to the side, put the car in park
I was like "Fuck the police" then I heard a bark, Damn
Ay, hold up
Ay, hold up
Ay, hold up

Wait a minute where's he going with it?
If you don't get it, need to go and get it
The attention doesn't last long
Had it when you turned it on
It will be gone before the last song
