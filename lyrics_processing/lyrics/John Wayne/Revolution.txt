Recorded this in the kitchen, because I was just tryin to get my cake up
This the revolution better wake up
Knocking at your front door, I'm here to stick the place up
Think I give a shit the color of your house
Is American History X it'll blow your brains out bitch
Scattered on the floor, then I hit the drawer
Where that bible at, God tell me what's in store
For a sinner like me, it's probably unlikely
That I'll find enlightening in a book I never read before
But that's just what we're going through
And don't take me as a radical
Because I really just got outta school
And I'm already going back to school
Trust me I ain't mad at you, could've been avoided
But disregard the attitude, I just get annoyed
When I don't know the policies of these people we appoint to lead
Want a leader of the free world? better follow me
Better yet, stand beside me
We all brothers in this battle with these criminals we fighting
You can keep the chain, I just need enough fame
To give these people some inspiring
You might also likeRevolution's now
Get the fuck up off the couch, put that magazine down
Go outside and do something about
This world that you couldn't live without
God bless
America

I'm about to run on, screw the commas
You don't know what's been brewing inside us
The new Assata's got no room for Hakuna Matata's
They talkin youth saying what is the future without us
But if we was Trayvon they too would've shot us
So who the fuck knows, who the fuck cares
Why we always try to leave it to whoever's upstairs?
If He got better things to do then we should focus
You ain't the only one who feels like you the only that noticed
We're busting out the matrix, relearning the basics
Any and all races, now we are the plaintiffs
Ready to state cases, ready to break cages
With or without Obama we're ready to make changes
I'm sick of falling in style, it's time to go beyond
You can follow me or choose to continue to mozie on
Pay attention to the words I spew
We the same I'm just trynna get a bird's eye view
Because the world I knew was never once what it really is
The city ain't the prettiest, half of it is hideous
The other half is smiling, happy, and totally oblivious
Thinking the rest ain't got it because they're just some fucking idiots
We're watching the 99% perish
While conservatives are more concerned with stopping gay marriage
Take a moment of musical meditation
