Having a dream, seeing a picture
And then bringing it to life...
It's hard to believe that person could do that

All I ever had was a dollar and a dream
You might have heard it
Do you know what it means?
You gotta risk everything
Barely having a thing
Just trying to live and make a living
In the land of the living
You want a two-car garage
A minaj, and a big Thanksgiving
Anything that I'm missing?
You're addicted to this
High walls and private jet-setting
Searching my pockets
Collecting the change for the washer
But I couldn't wash out these stains
The beat-up shoes I walk in
Got 'em looking down on me
Soon as I walk in
How you think that they'll respond when I start talking?
Say the money talks
And I guess that means that I was never saying nothing
Lost prophet, trying to prove something
You might also likeTell me when you gon' stop the bluffing
Putting me down won't combat
The conversation I'm starting
They said "it's too deep for the market."
Why?
Cause I know how it feels to go hard
Not make it too far
I'm coming back for my targets
All my people out there busting their ass
And making it happen
Without the establishment
Finally got it established
And you should be glad at it
You should

Love the life that you live
Make it something worth looking back at
Don't forget to forgive
Treat each day like it could be your last one
Gotta do the right thing
Whether that's good or bad
You gotta trust your instinct
Always follow your dreams
I know
Life ain't all that it seems
We got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
Yeah we got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
Yeah we got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
We got, we got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys

Coming in kamikaze
Till they stop me
I'll stack up the stock
When this drop
They gon' wanna sign me
Yeah well you should have caught me
Back before I caught up
I'm back, all it took was timing
Grinding
9-to-5 with my homies
We riding
5-to-9 I'm just perfecting my lines
If you ain't talking progress
We don't have the time
You knew me
But you don't know me
Call me out
I just call it growing
Now I'm going
I'm over-flowing
You should
Tuck your pride in
Don't ever show it
Say something that's worth recording
Otherwise
Truth be told
We don't wanna know it
Save your breath if it was not important
This is potent
They withheld the antidote
You gotta

Love the life that you live
Make it something worth looking back at
Don't forget to forgive
Treat each day like it could be your last one
Gotta do the right thing
Whether that's good or bad
You gotta trust your instinct
Always follow your dreams
I know
Life ain't all that it seems
We got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
Yeah we got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
Yeah we got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
We got, we got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys

I'm back to broke
I'm glad that this happened
You haven't seen mad yet
Haven't seen over-reaction
They're not reacting
There's no point in laughing
Give credit where due
No credit cards
Only IOU's
Took a break and I think I had a break-through
Make the money
Don't let the money make you

I've been chasing money my whole life
You need it to live
You don't need it to survive
I find that if you can give it out
It's not a matter of whether you get it back
It really is a matter of how you get it back

Love the life that you live
Make it something worth looking back at
Don't forget to forgive
Treat each day like it could be your last one
Gotta do the right thing
Whether that's good or bad
You gotta trust your instinct
Always follow your dreams
I know
Life ain't all that it seems
We got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
Yeah we got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
Yeah we got
Ups and downs
We got
Peaks and valleys
We got, we got
Ups and downs
We got
