This one's for my people
Act like you never heard that
Tell the truth, you don't keep it equal
Show love, I don't get it back
I ain't rolling with these rappers
Don't confuse me with these actors
They're just writing scripts, shooting clips
Talking about the weight up on their hip
But, I don't think that ever happened
I don't keep a piece, I just keep the peace
Wanna find me all alone
I wasn't worried about the working
I was more worried about the walk home
They were four-deep in a Camry
They were waiting on me, I was wrapping up the show
Caught me walking with my pops
We were in the parking lot
Got me wondering where everything went wrong but...

Don't ask about it
If you don't know about it
It's on my mind
Don't ask about
You don't know about it
It's on my mind

I ain't got time for this lame shit
Barely had time for this function
I was thinking 'bout giving up drinking
I was thinking 'bout giving up thinking
I was thinking 'bout never giving up
'Till I'm sleeping in the dirt, plant seeds in the Earth
Run and tell these mother-fuckers where you heard it first
John Wayne came down from the Sun to the Earth
Now I'm trying to take it somewhere much higher
Trying to set the sky on fire
Make these mother-fuckers retire
You can't get it all and get what you desire
You're lying
Talking 'bout flying, bird on a wire
My mama call's me Duke, I ain't Dukie from the Wire
But don't get it twisted
Something in this Swisher got me lifted
Medicated with that meditation
Told me that I'm distant
I don't see the difference
But then again I can't even see these bitches
Can't look back like my rear-view is missing
Headed to the future, I've been on a mission
They don't understand me
Came to the city couldn't even get a show
Now I'm pulling out the stops
Burn out in the parking lot
If I had a burner on me I would probably let it go like
BLAM
Don't ask about
Don't ask about
Don't ask about
Don't ask about

It's on my mind
It's on my mind
It's on my mind
It's on my mind
It's on my mind

Don't ask about it
You don't know about it
It's on my mind
Don't ask about
You don't know about it
