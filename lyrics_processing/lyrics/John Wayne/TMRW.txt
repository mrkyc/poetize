You know I always talk about growing up
But I feel like, each time I have that revelation
It's like, realizing it for the first time again, you know
Kinda trippy
John Wayne!

Tell me that you'll be here tomorrow
But tomorrow never really comes
Tell me that you'll be here tomorrow
To see me rising with the rising sun
I know, I know
We grow, we change, we move
It comes and it goes
Can you tell me what's the point?
What is all this all about?
Maybe when you hear this song
You can finally hear me out
Tomorrow

Back to the spot on the map
Put it back on my back
Wasn't taught how to rap
Never thought that I had, what I thought that I need
When in fact, I was faced with the thoughts I entrapped
Put myself in a box
When I saw, had dreams of it all
Never think of Spring in the Fall
When you're getting blown off
Had dreams of a call, everyday hope it changes tomorrow
Now, ay
Somehow to can't see that, believe that
Know that everyday I dreamed that
Came back, just to be back
It's a long time coming so I hope see that
Damn, can't believe that shit
Said it once before, know I mean that shit, ay
Switched up when I moved schools
Now you see me moving across the map
Dope raps in my backpack
You might also like
Tell me that you'll be here tomorrow
But tomorrow never really comes
Tell me that you'll be here tomorrow
To see me rising with the rising sun
I know, I know
We grow, we change, we move
It comes and it goes
Can you tell me what's the point?
What is all this all about?
Maybe when you hear this song
You can finally hear me out
Tomorrow

Back to the point of the track
Get it all off my chest
Send it back to react
Talk smack to my back, when I only showed love
Try to keep my act intact
Hold back from attack, keep the blade tucked
You don't wanna get fucked up
That's enough, keep a duffle full of bluffs
In a coupe suped up, hit a bump
Get your nose stuffed up, how long will the high be enough?
Pushing 120
Getting capital, from my capital
Call me captain, of the radical
Baby get down, bust it open to a lateral
Give it all night, pop an Adderal
Going for the gold
Keep the chains and the rings
Want a watch and a Range
Like I need to explain that a dollar and some change
Don't add up to be the same thing
Damn
Tell me that you'll be here tomorrow
But tomorrow never really comes
Tell me that you'll be here tomorrow
To see me rising with the rising sun
I know, I know
We grow, we change, we move
It comes and it goes
Can you tell me what's the point?
What is all this all about?
Maybe when you hear this song
You can finally hear me out
Tomorrow

Back to the point of the track
Back to the spot on the map
Put it back on my back
Wasn't taught how to rap
Back to the point of the track
Get it all off my chest
Back to the, Back, to the Back
Put it Back on my Back
Back
Never think of Spring in the Fall
When you're getting blown off
Trippy
You don't wanna get fucked up
That's enough, keep a duffle full of bluffs
In a coupe suped up, hit a bump
Get your nose stuffed up, how long will the high be enough?
