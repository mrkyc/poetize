Balling, say you're balling?
Call me Spaulding
I'm all in, girlfriend calling
Boys been stalling, they been bonging
Brew to brew, you look foreign to me
Plus you only spread that hate
Call you Stalin, you should call defeat
You've been falling
Don't even know who the hell you're talking to
I've been winning, since we were children
Caught the feeling back in high school
Sorry, I had to skip your classes
My dad said he'd whip my ass
I talk that teacher into passing
Guess that I just always had my way with words
You should know by now
You turning up and turn me down
We lived a block away in town
Said that I don't have that sound
Look where I came, they hear that now
Young kid that they talk about
Said I'd blow up before that gown
Push that back I'm cooling now
Realized it takes time to make this
Put my hours in toward greatness
10,000's an understatement
100,000 problems but my chick ain't one
We still got a ways to go, but look how far that we've come
You might also likeFeel like I already won while we were rolling up
Spilling on myself, I grab that lighter, please just hold my cup
Where the hell am I?
I do not know but I can't get enough
Sitting on a star, caught a comet
I was falling, catch the rocket
Swear if I'm just being honest, I just call it like I see it
The girl you brought here is a skeezer
She got bruises on her knees
These are just the things I pass on
While I'm dealing with these people
Show a smile when I greet you
Memory don't ever equal
You ain't fake, I swear you see through
Why you love the way they treat you?
Caught that vibe soon as I met you
Watch you scandal through the peep-hole
People need to look the other way when you walking through
Cause there is no need to encourage anything that you do
These type of hoes want attention
And they get it when you spending
Privacy tint on them benz's
Hope you got room for her friends's
Those Chanel's got different lenses
She don't see it like you see it
Got that bag, think she's a vegan
Cause she's all about the green
So she keeps coming back for more
You're telling her you're going broke
Type of life that she don't know
You don't want to let her go
So you never let her know
Now she's fucking on the low
You can't get that love to go
You watched it walking out the door
Push that back I'm cooling now
Realized it takes time to make this
Push that back I'm cooling now
Realized it takes time to make this
Push that back I'm cooling now
Realized it takes time to make this
Put my hours in toward greatness
