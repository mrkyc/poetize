Walk with me
If you wanna leave then I think I got the remedy
Just speak your mind
I just gotta know if you feel alright
You gotta slow your roll
You don't even know you're beautiful when the lights glow
Just hold my hand
Tell me if you think that I could be your man?

I just wanna get a minute
I just wanna get to know you
I don't want to get up in it
I just want the chance to show you
Baby why don't we just move in closer?
Late night slow dance
Sip the potion
Feel the motion
We been stressed out
We need to focus
Cause life's too short to feel so hopeless
Live in the moment and

Walk with me
If you wanna leave then I think I got the remedy
Just speak your mind
I just gotta know if you feel alright
You gotta slow your roll
You don't even know you're beautiful when the lights glow
Just hold my hand
Tell me if you think that I could be your man?

Just
Dont confuse me with
With these other M.C.'s
With the greed and the cheap sleaze
I aim to please
Got tree for the breeze
If you blow
We can freeze
Just free your mind
We can unwind with some cheap wine
All about the me time
That you and me
Tell me what we are, what we could
And what you know we should be
Just

Walk with me
If you wanna leave then I think I got the remedy
Just speak your mind
I just gotta know if you feel alright
You gotta slow your roll
You don't even know you're beautiful when the lights glow
Just hold my hand
Tell me if you think that I could be your man?
[Outro}
Walk with me
Speak your mind
Slow your roll
Hold my hand
