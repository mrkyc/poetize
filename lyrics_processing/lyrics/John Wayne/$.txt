(Scene from Wolf of Wall Street)

Hold up let me get my money straight
Came up doing this the honest way
Came from where they slang that Mary K
You could grow up quick and earn a K today
I never saw it going down that way
Never really had a chance to hesitate
I just pull it together, watch it fade away
Imma ride forever, get what I can take
I never put my money on a long shot
This right here's a sure thing
Go ahead, place your bet today
Walk the path that they have laid
No delay, I'm coming straight
Scrape the plate, and pray someday
We may just make it out this cage

I know you see it
I know you see it in my eyes
Higher than a kite, when you see me riding by
Got dreams of the paper
Got money on my mind
Hater's see you later
Give it time
I ain't lying

You might also like
I need more than this to get my money straight
I lose track of time and plot my great escape
Feind for finer things, that lobster, shrimp, and steak
Need the finest greens, we call that Garden State
If this the first you've witnessed, hate to say you're late
Just know I lack forgiveness, hater stay away
Cause this is sacrilegious, wonder what they'll say
Just keep you'r cool my pilgrim
Flowers bloom in May, I need bouquets
I'm talking Blue Dreams, Collard Greens
Northern Lights insight the scene
Dream team, C.R.E.A.M. Regime
Money making machine
Like the rubber band man, met the sandman
I'm full of plans man
Got a grand scheme, to burn down all the grand stands

I know you see it
I know you see it in my eyes
Higher than a kite, when you see me riding by
Got dreams of the paper
Got money on my mind
Hater's see you later
Give it time
I ain't lying
