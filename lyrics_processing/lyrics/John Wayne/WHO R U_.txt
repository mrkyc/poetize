Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?

Where we at now?
Lay your back down
Make a track now
Make you love how I act wild
Never used to act out
Pass out
Red light in the room
Let me put my mack down, baby

Who do you think you are?
Tell me who you think you are?

Keep your heart close
Tell me what you see when you look at me
Took the hard road
You want money, I just wanna be free
Maybe, a little green in my family tree
Don't think of where you wanna be
Just think of where you're gonna be
They told me it's a mindset
So, now, I just wanna find out where my dreams meet reality
Maybe, in the back of that Honda
Prom night, I was on the phone with your mama
"Trust me, you can trust me with your daughter"
She was caught up, falling, I caught her
Like the leaves in Autumn
She was falling like he leaves in Autumn
Back in B Town, hometown, homecoming
She was falling like he leaves in Autumn

Where we at now?
Lay your back down
Make a track now
Make you love how I act wild
Never used to act out
Pass out
Red light in the room
Let me put my mack down, baby

Who do you think you are?
(Gotta let me know, gotta let me know
Holding on to hope, never let it go)

Holding on to hope, never let it go)
