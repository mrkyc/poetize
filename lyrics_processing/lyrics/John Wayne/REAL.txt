One time for my, City
I felt the fire in my soul
I felt the fire in my soul

Demanding
Reprimanding
Felt the fire, still I'm standing
And still understanding
Life is what you make of it, I swear
Nothing's ever handed
Most couldn't handle the thought of comprehending
That's why you cover up your ears when I speak
Deep in your phone, looking for
What your favorite artist retweets
We speak
The words that ain't concerned with nouns and verbs
Full of feeling
Longing for healing
Would rather live and learn
I jumped the tracks, never looking back
I left my city, so that I could put my city on the map
Put your pity on my back, brush it off
It's shitty, they don't teach you how to react
They just teach you how to adapt to the system
You've grown accustom
Don't know the life your living
You put your faith inside a dollar bill then ask forgiveness
And you swear that's for your kids's
Who you kidding?
These excuses are illusive, it's been proven
Homie what's the difference?

They don't do it like this no more
They don't tell it like it is no more

I set it off
Cause I swear you never listen, blow the system
Turn that fucking music up
Feel the difference, feel what you've been missing
Listen close
Hear the gift I'm giving
Wish it all upon a star
You seek permission, you no competition
Bitch I felt the mother-fucking fire in my soul
A vision
Not some getting lifted, talking shit and ditching
Type of premonition
(Listen) You need to pay close attention
Cause this the H.A.M. flow
What the G's want, what your ho probably didn't come for
Dare you to hit the next song
Promise that you done for
Dumbfounded, hit the google search
John's well rounded
Been pounding pavements, just the space between the ground
Funny, because you hating's just the space between the sound
An atmosphere, the space between outer space and the clouds
I got higher, the only conclusion that I have found
Was to change the world, you gotta change your mind
And when your life is figured out
Then all you have is time
They don't do it like this no more
They don't tell it like it is no more
X2

They don't do it like this no more
They don't tell it like it is no more
No one teaching the kids how they should live no more
They tell them how they're living
Who the hell you kidding? You know it
X2
Let me keep it 100
I'm having day dreams about me burning this money
X4

They don't do it like this no more, man
They don't tell it like it is no more, no one tells it like it is
They don't do it like this no more
