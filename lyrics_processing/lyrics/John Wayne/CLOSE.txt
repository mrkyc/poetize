C'mon get closer to it
See the edge, wanna push you off
Just wanna talk, we could take a walk
Watch what you say, you could set me off
And you can't take it back, but you could take it off
I just wanna know, what's your alibi?
Why, you ain't here with some other guy?
We could walk around the gallery
You a star, swear you fell from the galaxy
Now you're running through my mind
Getting exercise
I could work you out
You're in love with the love I'm talking 'bout
Inside, all the time, you my side kick
Down to ride, take a flight, no side chick
Quick to get the money, and it's no accident
She got goals, got more than attractiveness
Still a dime, I'm just saying that's an additive
I was lost on the run when she found the kid, she said...

C'mon get closer to it
See the edge, wanna push you off
Can't stop, when you want it all
Can't fall if you never take a jump, man
Still ball and I never rock Jump Man's
Got a palm in my hand, I'm floating
On a cloud, times nine, we coasting
Coast to coast, so dope, no boasting
Hold a toast, for the host, with the most-est
I put it down like a scuba-dive
Looking supa-fly
Different style than the rapper type
Never been alike
Never tried but to stay alive
Hold on to it tight
If you're looking for the light
You can look into my eyes
I was kicked back
Felt a breeze
Burn a tree
Pay to play
Pay the fee
That's all on me
Get that degree
500 degrees, we were burning up
You feel the energy

C'mon get closer to it
See the edge, wanna push you off
X4
I wanna push you around
(and I will, and I will)
I wanna push you down
(and I will, and I will)
I wanna push you around
(and I will, and I will)
I wanna push you, push you, hey, hey, and I will
