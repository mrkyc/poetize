I was totin' my pack along a dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with high and canvas covered load
If you're going to Winnemucca Mack, with me, you can ride
So I climbed into the cab, and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I've seen a road with so much dust and sand
And I said, "Listen, bud, I've travelled every road in this here land."

I've been everywhere man
I've been everywhere, man
Across the deserts bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel, I've had my share, man
I've been everywhere

I've been to Reno, Chicago, Fargo, Minnesota, Buffalo, Toronto, Winslow, Sarasota
Wichita, Tulsa, Ottawa, Oklahoma, Tampa, Panama, Mattawa, La Paloma
Bangor, Baltimore, Salvador, Amarillo, Tocopilla, Barranquilla, and Padilla, I'm a killer

I've been everywhere man
I've been everywhere, man
Across the deserts bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel, I've had my share, man
I've been everywhere
