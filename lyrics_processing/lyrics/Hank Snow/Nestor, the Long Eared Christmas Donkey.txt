Our fleet-footed friend from the north
Who lights Santa's way through the darkness
As he drives his sleigh back and forth
But there's someone else we should mention
If we want the whole story told
He carried the first gift of Christmas
More precious than diamonds or gold
Nestor was a donkey who seldom laughed or played
'Cause no one evey used him in the stable where he stayed
And all the camels teased him, the other donkeys too
They said, look at little Nestor, there's nothin' he can do
Look at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
When he looks at his reflection, ears are all he sees
Nestor's heart was broken and his eyes were full of tears
If only there was somethin' he could do about his ears
One dark night two strangers gave Nestor a surprise
They chose him from all others for they loved his gentle eyes
A man was called by Joseph, Mary was his bride
She needed help to Bethlehem and Nestor's back to ride
They travelled through the desert but hadn't gone too far
When winter clouds no longer let them see their guiding star
But Nestor learned a secret as he listened to the breeze
And the angels gave directions to the ears that touched his knees
You might also likeLook at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
When he looks at his reflection, ears are all he sees
Nestor's heart was broken and his eyes were full of tears
If only there was somethin' he could do about his ears
And so it was that Nestor found the manger where they stayed
Where kings and wise men bowed before the baby where he lay
Mary bore our Saviour and Nestor brought them there
A gift of love from God above for all the world to share
Though, Rudolph, I just love you, I know you'd want it said
Nestor's ears are lovely as a reindeer's nose is red
So children, if you're happy when you trim your Christmas trees
You might thank a little donkey whose ears hung to his knees
Look at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
They shouted as they praised him and his friends were all so pleased
Nestor was so happy and his eyes held no more tears
