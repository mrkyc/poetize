Oh this is the place where the fishermen gather
Oil-skins and boots and the Cape hands batten down;
All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers
They congregate here on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
Some are workin' their jiggers, while others are yarnin'
There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down;
While all kinds of fun, jokes and drinks are begun
As they wait for the squid on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain
There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown;
There's Rip, Red and Gory out here in the dory
A runnin' down squires on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
There's men from the harbor, there's men from the tickle
And all kinds of motor-boats, green, gray and brown;
Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby
He's chawin' hard tack on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
God bless my soul, list to, there's Skipper John Champy
He's the best hand at squid jiggin' here, I'll be bound;
Hello, what's the row? Why he's jiggin' one now
The very first squid on the Squid Jiggin' Ground

He's gettin' well on, but he's still pretty sound;
While Uncle Bob Hockins wears six pairs of stockin's
Whenever he's out on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
Holy Smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited
It's a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned;
There's a bustle, confusion, the wonderful hustle
They're all jiggin' squid on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
Says Barney, "The squids are on top of the water
I just felt me jiggers jig five fathoms down
But a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat
Now he's swearin'like mad on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
There's poor Uncle Louie, his whiskers are spattered
With spots of the squid juice that's flyin' around;
One poor little guy got it right in the eye
But they don't give a darn on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
Now, if you ever feel inclined to go squiddin'
Leave your white clothes behind in the town;
And if you get cranky without your silk hanky
