In the middle of the night
You keep showing up
Running 'round in my mind
Walk it off
Walk it off
Walk it off now
But I can still feel you
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off now
But I can still hear you
Haunt me like a ghost
Even with my eyes closed
I can see your face in the dark
I feel you in my bones
Like a chill so cold
You're making your way to my heart
Like a ghost
I can see your face in the dark
Like a ghost
You're making your way to my heart
Shadows fly around
Like a bad, bad dream
Whispering so loud
I know it's you calling me
Walk it off
Walk it off
Walk it off now
But I can still feel you
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off now
But I can still hear you
Haunt me like a ghost
Even with my eyes closed
I can see your face in the dark
I feel you in my bones
Like a chill so cold
You're making your way to my heart
Like a ghost
I can see your face in the dark
Like a ghost
You're making your way to my heart
I can see your face
I can see your face in the dark
You're making your way
You're making your way to my heart
Haunt me like a ghost
Even with my eyes closed
I can see your face in the dark
I feel you in my bones
Like a chill so cold
You're making your way to my heart
Like a ghost
I can see your face in the dark
Like a ghost
You're making your way to my heart
I can see your face
I can see your face in the dark
You're making your way
