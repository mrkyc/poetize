Thinking 'bout our last long talk
Been sitting here at this table at your favorite restaurant
Been hoping I could meet you here so that I could make this perfectly clear
That all I do is think about you since you went and left me on my own
I'm so alone, ohhhh
I'm so lonely baby. And i need to say that...
I know I was wrong, ohhhh. and I'm asking you to come back home
Don't wanna be here alone
Listen your sweet body baby, tears are streaming down my face, yeah
Go on and make your mind up-your mind up
I ain't got no where to be right now, baby
But loving you's a long, long way from here
And all I ask of you my dear
Is maybe you would reconsider all the love you've missed since you've been gone
I'm so alone, ohhh
I'm so lonely baby, and I need to say that I know I was wrong, I was so wrong
And I'm asking you to come back home, don't wanna be here alone
I know I was the fist to say good-bye, I was a fool baby
Look at these tears in my eyes
And if loving you's a long, long way from here, then all I ask of you my dear
Is maybe you would reconsider all the love you've missed since you've been gone
You might also likeI'm so alone, ohh, I'm so lonely baby, and I need to say that
I know I was wrong, I was so wrong
And I'm, asking you to come back home, don't wanna be here alone
I'm so alone, ohhh, I'm so lonely baby. Ohh yes
And I know that I was wrong, oh I was wrong
But I'm asking you to come back home, I don't wanna be here alone
I'm so alone.......
