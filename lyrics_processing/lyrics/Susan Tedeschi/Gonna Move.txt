Quiet country house I had to call home
Living with a couple folks, rich millionaires
Sat on their money Lord it seems they didn't care
Finally we moved to our own place
Where I could walk around with a smile on my face
And i knew in order to make a stand
I had to pull up my roots and move on in this land
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
Came to a school in the big city
Looked around at the lights and I thought they were pretty
They told me and teached me to live by their rules
So I wouldn't be nobody's fool
I found out, not too long
Their rules wouldn't let me sing my song
I knew in order to make a stand
I had to pull up my roots and move on in this
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there

I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
Then I joined the college ranks
There they said they'd teach me how to think
Gave me books to read and papers to write
They didn't know that this girl's come to fight
But I found out after awhile
Reading those books was making me loose my smile
I knew in order to not conceal
I had to play music and express what I feel
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me if you want to go there
I'm gonna move away from here
You can find me oh but you're gonna have to go there
Oh, I'm gonna move
I'm gonna roll out, roll on
Oh, and if it takes to long
I'm gonna jump on a plane
Oh, I'm gonna move away from here
