So fly
Yeah
Listen!
I bumped carts at the grocery store
Spilled that display things all over the floor
But now I'm face to face with you
Girl
Could it be my eyes deceive
There stands an angel shoppin' on isle 3
Heaven must be shampoo
Pre-Chorus
Girl your so beautiful
Beautiful
Girl I'm so pitiful
Pitiful
Torn up from the floor I'm
I can't ignore ya
Chorus
Ya break necks when you walk by
Walk by
Ya got wings cause your so fly
So fly
