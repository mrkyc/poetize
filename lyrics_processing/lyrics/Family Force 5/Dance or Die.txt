Respond if you're alive, give me a sign of life
I need to say to you, say to you
I've found a way to fight, one hope for all mankind
We're gonna take control, dancing is your weapon
Let your moves unfold, kill 'em with your steppin'
We can win this war, it's time to come together
Now we're stronger than we were before

They're tryna take our lives (tryna take our lives)
But we will survive (we will survive)
We're running out of time, the world ends tonight
Unless we dance or die, da-da-dance or die
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Dance or die, da-da-dance or die
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Da-da-da-dance or die, d-d-d-d-dance or die

Take back the night, dance for your right
I'm on my way to you, way to you
We can reunite, and watch the sky ignite
They couldn't take the sound, they fall harder when they're bigger
Yeah, they all crashed down, our party pulled the trigger
We won this war because we came together
Made 'em wish that they were never born
