Time don't wait for no one
Leaving you broken
Especially when you're under the gun
Makes things complicated
Leaving you jaded toward
Everything that's under the sun

Tick-tock, tick-tock goes the clock
Tick-tock, tick-tock 'til I drop
But time don't faze me, not a bit
'Cause I give mine to you, all of it
Death can't shake me from your hand
Me minus you equals not a chance
It's good to know that when I go
You'll never ever let me
Never ever let me, never ever let me
Never ever let me, never ever let me
Never ever let me, never ever let me
Never ever let me, never ever let me go

I want some face-to-face
Just give me that full embrace
What did I hear you say?
That you will never ever let me go
I'll never know
When it's my time to go
I know one thing fo' sho'
That you will never ever let me go
Never ever let me go
You might also like
The mind is a ticking time bomb itching to go off
Impatiently, it waits in the calm
Bang, bang, it might be over in one little moment
Before you know it, it's all gone

Tick-tock, tick-tock goes the clock
Tick-tock, tick-tock, gonna pop
It's good to know that when it goes
You'll never ever let me
Never ever let me, never ever let me
Never ever let me, never ever let me go

One thing I'll never know
The time and place that I'll go
Death can shake me from your hand
You Never let me go
I Know
You Never ever ever evey every let me go
You Never ever let me go
I Know
You Never ever never ever let me go
I want some Face to Face
Just Gimme that Full Embrace
What did I Hear you Say?
That you will Never Ever Let me Go
I'll never Know
When It's my Time to Go
I Know one Thing fo' sho'
That you Will Never Ever Let me-
I want some Face to Face
Just Gimme that Full Embrace
What did I Hear you Say?
That you will Never Ever Let me Go
I'll never Know
When It's my Time to Go
I Know one Thing fo' sho'
