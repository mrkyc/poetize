I've never seen a soul set free
Through an argument
I've never seen a hurt get healed
In a protest
But I've seen sinners turned to saints
Because of grace
It's love, love that lights the way
Love that lights the way

Let it be a heart wide open
Bigger than the words we've spoken
Let it be a heart for the broken
If we're gonna light, light
Light the way
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
Nothin' but love, nothin' but love, yeah
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
It's love that lights the way

It's not about the stand we take
But the grace we give
It's not about the name we make
But the life we live
Heard about a King who sat down
Took my place
True love gave His life away
It's love that lights the way
You might also like
Let it be a heart wide open
Bigger than the words we've spoken
Let it be a heart for the broken
If we're gonna light, light
Light the way
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
Nothin' but love, nothin' but love, yeah
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
It's love that lights the way

Stronger than every fear
Comfort for all the tears
It's where the war is run
And it has overcome
Louder than the loudest shout
Deeper than the deepest doubt
We'll watch the walls fall down
We'll watch the walls fall down

Let it be a heart wide open
Bigger than the words we've spoken
Let it be a heart for the broken
If we're gonna light, light
Light the way
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
Nothin' but love, nothin' but love, yeah
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
It's love that lights the way
It's love that lights the way
