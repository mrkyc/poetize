Fever's got me sweating and you know I'm burning up

Hey, you, did you turn up the heat
It's getting hotter and I'm growing weak
Maybe it's because you're standing close to me
I'm coming down with something feverishly
(I think my body's in shock
It just don't know what to do
I feel my temperature rising past 102)
Fever, fever, fever, fever

Fever
(Turn up the heat)
Fever
(Come on and get sick with me)
Give me what you got, cause you know it's getting hot
Fever
(I'm turning flush)
Fever
(I'm burning up)
Fever's got me sweating and you know I'm burning up
Yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa
You might also like
Fever's got this thing that I just can't shake
I tried to sweat it out but it would not break
My heart is taking all the heat that it can take
Just let it burn me up for heaven's sake!
(Hot-hot-hot-hot to the touch
To the N'th degree
Thermometer's reading 'bout infinity)
Fever, fever, fever, fever

Fever
(Turn up the heat)
Fever
(Come on and get sick with me)
Give me what you got, cause you know it's getting hot
Fever
(I'm turning flush)
Fever
(I'm burning up)
Fever's got me sweating and you know I'm burning up
Fever's got me sweating and you know I'm burning up

Blow up the phone lines
Cause I'm already at the red line
Somebody call me up the New York Times
This fever's gonna make the headlines
Blow up the phone lines (Yeah, whoa)
Cause I'm already at the red line (Yeah, whoa)
Somebody call me up the New York Times (Yeah, whoa)
This fever's gonna make the headlines, headlines, headlines, headlines
(Fever!)
