Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall
Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall
Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall
Get your, get your back, get your back off the wall

This revolution starts when you're moving
Don't wanna step to me unless you plan on losing
Not here to brag, not here for thrills
I'm here to battle, baby, I dance to kill, fall in
(Shaking like a leaf, buckling at the knees, stop dragging your feet)
Time to go all in
(Time for standing tall, move to kill 'em all, no win, lose, or draw)
Get your back off the wall

Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall
(Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall)
Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall
(Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall)

We dig them trenches so they be tripping
I'm on the front lines, yeah, I see them flinching
Annihilation of the enemy
Wrath pours down when I move my feet, fall in
(All my new recruits, now you're in my troop, shake 'em in their boots)
Time to go all in
(They can scratch and claw, we ain't backing off, time to lay down the law)
Get your back off the wall

Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall
(Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall)
Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall
(Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall)

Back off the wall, get, get your back off the wall
Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall, wall
Get your back off that wall, wall
Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall

Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall
(Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall)
Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall
(Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall)
Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall
(Get your back off the wall, get your back off the wall
This is a call to you all, get your back off the wall
Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall
Get your, get your, get your back, get your back off the wall
