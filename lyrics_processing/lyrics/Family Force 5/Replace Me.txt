My batteries died some time ago
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I got a heart-shaped box where they must go
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Corrosion's building everyday
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
My flesh is leading me astray, that's why I've started to decay
And I will slowly rot away, but I can't feel that anyway

This heart, it wants to beat, these lungs, they want to breathe
These eyes, they want to see, got a mouth that wants to sing

Desperation, needing you
Every last breath I scream for you
Shatter me into a million pieces
Make me new
Crush me, tear me, break me, mold me
Make me what you want me to be
I am yours, for you to use
So, take and replace me with you

I need more than a jump start to get me through
My disconnection is now the issue
(I miss my first love bad and it's driving me mad
Just like a mixed up crazy person out of his head
Its been a long, long time, I've been on the decline
I do an about face so I can be replaced, 180)

This heart, it wants to beat, these lungs, they want to breathe
These eyes, they want to see, got a mouth that wants to sing

Desperation, needing you
Every last breath I scream for you
Shatter me into a million pieces
Make me new
Crush me, tear me, break me, mold me
Make me what you want me to be
I am yours, for you to use
So, take and replace me with you

One for the body, two for the soul
Three to get ready, now go go go
Replace me with you
Replace me with you
Desperation, needing you
Every last breath I scream for you

Desperation, needing you
Every last breath I scream for you
Shatter me into a million pieces
Make me new
Crush me, tear me, break me, mold me
Make me what you want me to be
I am yours, for you to use
