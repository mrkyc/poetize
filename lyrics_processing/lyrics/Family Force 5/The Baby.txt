Shining down, where He lies
Gonna be a life changer
Sleeping in a manger, tonight
Riding on the town into Bethlehem, see?
Hey, Girl, the Baby's so pretty
Got you some Frankincense, got you some Murr
Gotta truck full of presents, should I dump 'em right hur?
Gifts (for the Baby)
Presents (for the Baby)
I'll make it rain (all night on for the Baby)
I got some Silver & Gold
Let the legend be told
Don't you know that I'm all about the Baby?
Gifts (for the Baby)
Presents (for the Baby)
I'll make it rain (all night on for the Baby)
I got some Silver & Gold
Let the legend be told
Don't you know that I'm all about the Baby?
Wrapped up in some swaddling clothes
...I think Mary knows
Yeah, we came this far
We are the kings that know who You are
You might also likeComin' on a ride
Away from my Hood
Got You some Incense
'Cuz it smells so good

Momma got some royalty

Fallin' from the sky

Porin' down rain
'Cuz I'm all about the Baby
