It's Your goodness
That leads us to repentance
It's Your kindness
That leads us to Your heart
It's Your grace that
Give us a place at Your table
Without apology
When You invite me, I'll sit down
I've fallen before
And I believed
I believed it rendered You unable
And suddenly unable to be omnipotent
Omnipresent, but there You were
I fell down at Your feet
You were always there
And You offered me a seat
You offered me a seat at the table
And You told me who I was
You told me who I was
You gave me a seat
And You told me who I was

I am loved by You
Loved by You
I am loved by You
I'm accepted
I'm accepted
