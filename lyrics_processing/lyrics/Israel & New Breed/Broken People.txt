I love the way
You embrace
Broken people like me
I love the way
You won't forsake
Broken people like

Me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e-e
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I've been written off before
Down to the slamming door in my face
I tried to hide my scars
But you specialize in wounded things

You waited up for me
Because you never sleep; You never slumber
I'm healing as we speak
'Coz you specialize in shattered dreams

'Nd I love the way
You embrace
Broken people like me
I love the way
You never turn away
Broken people like
You might also like
'N rejection haunted me
I suffered silently, 'Till you came
You call me past redeemed
'coz you specialize in rescuing
(I love the way!)

I love the way
You embrace
Broken people like me
I love the way
You never turn away
Boken people like me
I love the way
You embrace
Broken people like me
I love the way
You never turn away
Boken people like

Me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh Me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e-e
