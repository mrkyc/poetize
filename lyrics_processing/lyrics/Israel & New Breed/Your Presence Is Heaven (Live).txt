Who is like You, Lord in all the earth?
Matchless love and beauty, endless worth
Nothing in this world can satisfy
Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry

Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me

Treasure of my heart and of my soul
In my weakness, You are merciful
Redeemer of my past and present wrongs
Holder of my future days to come

Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me
God, Your presence is heaven to me
There's nothing like Your presence
(Nothing like Your presence)
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
You might also like
All my days on earth I will await
The moment that I see You face to face
Nothing in this world will satisfy
Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry
Nothing in this world will satisfy
Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry
Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry!

Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me
There's nothing like Your presence
(Nothing like Your presence)
There ain't like Your presence
Your presence is heaven to me
To me, to me, to me
Ooh! To me, to me, to me
So we're singing...
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me

Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me
