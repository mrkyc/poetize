Your latter will be greater than your past
And You will be blessed more than you can ask
Despite all that has been done
The best is yet to come
And your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater than the rest...

Your latter will be greater than your past
You will be blessed more than you can ask
Despite all that has been done
The best is yet to come
And your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater than the rest!

All things are possible, possible
Possible, possible
All things are possible, possible
Possible, possible
And your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater than the rest
All things are possible, possible
Possible, possible
All things are possible, possible
Possible, possible
And your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater
My latter will be greater
My latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater
Your latter will be greater than the rest!

Now lift up your hands all over this building
And receive the Word of the Lord
You may have come through some situations and circumstances
Look at  one minute
How many of you know The Bible declares
The end of a thing is better than the beginning of a thing
God knows the end from the beginning
And God promises that the glory of the latter house
Shall be greater than the glory of the former house
I just want to take a moment right here and minister
To those of you that have been through something
And the enemy has lied to you and told you
That the best is behind you
I've come to call the devil a liar and say
That the best is in front of you
That your latter will be greater
That you haven't seen anything yet
Your best days and your blessed days, they are ahead of you
That your problems don't equal your promises
The devil's "No" cannot compete with God's "Yes"
Sing the best is yet to come...

The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
Oh, the best is yet to come!
The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
Oh, the best is yet to come!
Our best is yet to come
Our best is yet to come
Oh, our best is yet to come!
The King is soon to come
The King is soon to come
Oh, the King is soon to come!
The King is soon to come
The King is soon to come
Oh, the King is soon to come!
The King is soon to come
The King is soon to come
