Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy
When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful you are
And how great your affections are for me
And Oh, how He loves us so
Oh, how He loves us
How He loves so, oh whoa
He loves us
Oh, How He loves us
Oh, How He loves us
Oh, How He loves
He is jealous for me
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy
When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful you are
And how great your affections are for me
And Oh
How he Loves us so
How he loves us
How he loves us so
He loves us
Oh, How He loves us
Oh, How He loves us
Oh, How He loves
He loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves
So we are His portion
And He is our prize
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking
Oooh
So Heaven meets Earth like a sloppy wet kiss
And my heart turns violently inside my chest
I don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about the way
I think about the way
He loves us
Oh, How He loves us
Oh, How He loves us
Oh, How He loves
He loves us
Oh, How He loves us
Oh, How He loves us
Oh, How He loves
Yea
Oh what a love
The Father's love
Your love is great, we receive it today
Where would we be
I meant there is no us without it
It's wonderful, glorious
It's redeeming, restoring
And it's beautiful
And it's beautiful
Oh so beautiful
Yes it's beautiful
Yes it's beautiful
Oh so beautiful
Oh, How He loves me
How He loves me
And it's beautiful
And it's beautiful
Oh so beautiful
Yes it's beautiful
Yes it's beautiful
Oh so beautiful
How He loves me
How He loves me
