What does it mean to be saved?
Isn't it more than just a prayer to pray?
More than just a way to Heaven
What does it mean to be His?
To be formed in His likeness
And know that we have a purpose?

To be salt and light in the world, in the world
To be salt and light in the world

Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Say so, say so
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Say so, say so

Oh, that the church would arise
Oh, that we would see with Jesus' eyes
We could show the world Heaven
Show what it means to be His
To be formed in His likeness
Show them they have a purpose
You might also like
To be salt and light in the world, in the world
To be salt and light in the world
To be salt and light in the world, in the world
To be salt and light in the world

To be salt and light in the world
To be salt and light in the world, in the world
To be salt and light in the world
To be salt and light in the world
In the world, in the world
