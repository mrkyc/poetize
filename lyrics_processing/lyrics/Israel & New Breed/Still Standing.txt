You gave me courage to believe
That all your goodness I will see

And if it had not been for You
Standing on my side, where would I be?

If not for Your goodness, if not for Your grace
I don't know where I would be today
If not for Your kindness, I never could say
I'm still standing
If not for Your mercy, if not for Your love
I most likely would have given up
If not for Your favor, I never could say
I'm still standing but by the grace of God

To You I lift my offering
And set my heart on higher things

For if it had not been for You
Standing on my side, where would I be?
You might also like
If not for Your goodness, if not for Your grace
I don't know where I would be today
If not for Your kindness, I never could say
I'm still standing
If not for Your mercy, if not for Your love
I most likely would have given up
If not for Your favor, I never could say
I'm still standing but by the grace of God

I'm still standing, I'm still standing
I'm still standing but by the grace of God
I'm still standing, I'm still standing
I'm still standing but by the grace of God
I'm still standing, I'm still standing
I'm still standing but by the grace of God

If not for Your goodness, if not for Your grace
I don't know where I would be today
If not for Your kindness, I never could say
I'm still standing
If not for Your mercy, if not for Your love
I most likely would have given up
If not for Your favor, I never could say
I'm still standing, standing
I'm still standing but by the grace of God
I'm still standing, I'm still standing
I'm still standing but by the grace of God
I'm still standing, I'm still standing
I'm still standing but by the grace of God
I'm still shouting, I'm still shouting
I'm still shouting but by the grace of God
I'm still jumping, I'm still jumping
I'm still jumping but by the grace of God
I'm still standing, I'm still standing
