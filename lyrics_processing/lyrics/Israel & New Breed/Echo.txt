When night has fallen
When fear is common
Still You're calling me
When faith is lost and
My hope exhausted
You will be my strength, c'mon
And when my mind says I'm not good enough
God, You're enough for me
I've decided I'm not giving up
You won't give up on me, You won't give up on me
Your love is holding on and it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo (Come on your love)
Your love is holding on and it won't let go (I feel it breaking out)
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Echo in my soul
Soul
I feel it in my soul
Soul
In every season You keep repeating
Your promises to me
Now there's no stopping what You have started
Until it is complete, come on, say it with me
