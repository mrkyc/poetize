It's a time of favor, It's a time of reign
It's a time of increase, It's a time of harvest
It is a time for reaping
You've shone in many tears
You've shone countless nights
You've paced your floor back and forth
You've believed
You stood on words that you have yet to see come to pass
But this is the time for reign, Ask for the reign
Ask the reign in the time of reign
Ask for favor while favor is falling
