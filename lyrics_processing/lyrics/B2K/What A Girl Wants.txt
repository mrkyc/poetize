Yo, I don't know what's goin' on
But I do know one thing
You gotta make it right, aight?

Man, what's goin on wit' you?
Why you treat her like ya' do?
When you know the girl is all about you, tell me
Why you always lose ya' head?
Should find a better way to handle it
You need to stop this game before you mess around and lose
(Im just tryna' help you) What a girl wants

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
A guy to be there for her
What a girl needs, what a girl wants
What a girl needs, what a girl wants
Honesty, love and a friend

You always comin' down on her (Why?)
Losin' all the power (Why?)
When you know that she'll do anything for you, tell me
Why you always lie to her?
And doin' things she don't deserve
Man if you don't stop, then she'll end up leaving you

And I'll be right there to say I told you so
No more you, had your chance
Take a hike, shoulda' been a man
Now she's gone
All because you were doin' wrong
Shoulda' listened to me
