When I pulled up in my ride it was four fly girls sittin on the side
So I glanced to my left and I winked my eye but they wasn't lookin

So I rolled over there and tried to spit but the main pigeon was

When I pulled up the light was red
Romeo hit the brakes and then he said
Look at the girl in the pink
