Yo, it's alright girl
I understand how you feel
You ain't gotta lie to yourself
It's easier to see
Listen

Baby it's official
I'm tired of looking at you out my window
I peep you when you coming home from work
With your high heels on
Louie Vuitton
Girl you got it going on
It's crazy, I'm tired of telling people I'm your homie
Like they don't know that you really want me
Girl I know it's wrong
I'm feeling you strong
Why don't you just put me on

When you're loving me
When you're touching me
It's like ecstasy
To the tenth degree
Girl I think you got me sprung
But I'm not number one
I'm too young for you
Yet not young enough
To do what I do
Now ain't that the truth
Girl I think you got me sprung
But I'm not number one, no
You might also like
Girl you see I need you
I know you mad at how your man treats you
But he can't do it for you like I do
Huh, you claim you wanna leave
So give him back his keys
Girl come and roll with me
It's simple
If you don't wanna be with shorty no more
Then turn around and walk into my heart's door
It's open for you
And tell him that you're through, oh

When you're loving me
When you're touching me
It's like ecstasy (yeah baby)
To the tenth degree
Girl I think you got me sprung (no no)
But I'm not number one (I'm not number one)
I'm too young for you
Yet not young enough
To do what I do
Now ain't that the truth
Girl I think you got me sprung (I said you got me sprung baby)
But I'm not number one, no
Keep it real with me (oh baby)
Don't try to play me girl (don't try to play me girl)
Got some years on me but (oh can you tell me)
What's he got on me?
(Is it his seniority, yeah)
Or are you afraid that I am what you need?

When you're loving me
When you're touching me
It's like ecstasy
To the tenth degree (oh)
Girl I think you got me sprung (you got me sprung)
But I'm not number one
I'm too young for you
Yet not young enough
To do what I do (do)
Now ain't that the truth
Girl I think you got me sprung
But I'm not number one, no

Wooh! I ain't gonna lie
I got you now
