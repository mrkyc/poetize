Oh
Yeah, uh
I love you
Check this out

From day one, you and I've been friends
Hanging out, having fun, chilling
Now I know at times I got crazy
Silly ways and acting shady
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, check this out)
You peep things in me no one sees
You hold it down for sheezy
Now I have friends I thought were true
But no one more true than you
So what am I gonna do?

It took a while for me to see
How special you treated me

Maybe that's the reason why I love you
You're my heart girl
And with all the crazy things that I do
You're still here girl
No one else can make me feel like you do
You've shared my world
Baby, that's the reason why I love you
You might also like
No other girl is quite like you
And no one has my back like you do
Girl, you're one of a kind
And you blow my mind (Baby, mmm)
And I'm glad to say you're mine

Girl you're the one that changed me
From a boy into a man (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Maybe that's the reason why I love you
You're my heart girl
And with all the crazy things that I do
You're still here girl
No one else can make me feel like You do
You've shared my world
Baby, that's the reason why I love you

It took a while for me to see
How special you've treated me

Maybe that's the reason why I love you
You're my heart girl
And with all the crazy things that I do
You're still here girl
No one else can make me feel like you do
You've shared my world
Baby, that's the reason why I love you
Maybe that's the reason why I love you
(Why I'm so crazy over you)
You're my heart girl
And with all the crazy things that I do
(Oh, crazy things that I put you through)
You're still here girl
No one else can make me feel like you do
(No one else can make me feel the way)
You've shared my world
Baby that's the reason why I love you

Why I love you
I love you
