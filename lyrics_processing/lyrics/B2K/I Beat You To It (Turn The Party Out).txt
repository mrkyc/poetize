Yeah, ayo, you know what I'm sayin'
A lot of people heard the last album
And really didn't understand what B2K was all about
But I'ma tell y'all
We ain't have no soul image, just gangsta on our album
This right here's about to be gangsta
You sure?
You know what I'm sayin', Boog?
A'ight, let's see (Come on, uh), check it out

Hot spots, I bang like Little Rock
Step up in the club and watch the beat stop
Hey shorty, can you do that dance in my drop?
Pop that and make that booty clap like flip-flops?
Like the Flintstones, we can make the bed rock
Yes, this little boy got a house on the hill
Call me Mattel, I got so many hot wheels
Now you know what I'm about, let's turn this party out, a'ight?

Everybody, put your hands up if you feel me

Let's leave right now, let's stop playin' around
It's a lot I wanna do for you, how that sound? Uh
You's a cutie, scarf over your doobie (On your doobie)
Louis or Gucci look good on your booty
(Look good on your booty)
What's really good, can I floss you in the hood?
Tell you things that you think I mean, knock on wood
So make it happen if you wanna handle it
Tonight I'm a good man but tomorrow I'm scandalous
So grab your coat, let's make an exit
And if your moms is home, girl, we hittin' the Lexus

Yo, on this last one, man, I gotta speak the real
Let everybody know
We don't ride around in trucks, we ride in the Bentley bus
Other crews recognize, y'all can't fade us
When Platinum Status drop heat, man, you already know
B2K and Chris Stokes, it always equal big dough
We in a 4-point-6 with four Asian chicks
They admiring the ice around my neck and wrist
I'm like, "Show me, baby girl, how you do that thurr"
I got 'em all askin', "Fizz, can I play in your hurr?"

Check it out
Let me pop that knowledge on y'all real quick, uh
A lot of people think B2K, you know what I'm sayin', it's all about imagin' and, you know, dancin' and stuff like that
And the people that's talkin' like that is probably the people that don't have an image, you know what I'm sayin'
So if you need one, come to T.U.G., we got a lot of 'em
We'll give you one, not a problem
'Cause we focused, man
Once again, we focused, man
Probably got done on the last track but I just wanted to get my point across
Round two, Raz B
Round two, Raz B, where you at?
