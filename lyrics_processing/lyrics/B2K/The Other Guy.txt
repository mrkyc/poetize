It's another day
Of you trippin' out on me, hah
I could retaliate and bring the ghetto outta me, hah
But I feelin' you
But not the things you do
I would rather set you straight
Than smack you in your face
This is not your ex-relationship
'Cause all I gotta say is

Girl, you just don't realize
You gotta figure out
I'm not like the other guy (Don't be like those other guys)
Because I wear saggy jeans, tim boots
And don't lie like the rest do
You gotta figure out
I'm not like the other guy
Not like the other guy

There is no reason for
All these crazy confrontations, hah
Let's set the record straight
You're the only one for me, hah
But true at heart I am
Please, just understand
Okay, hah, look
First I gave you up
Then I played the role
Then I fell in love with you, girl
You might also like
Girl, you just don't realize (Oh, you don't realize)
You gotta figure out
I'm not like the other guy (I'm not like the other guy)
Because I wear saggy jeans, tim boots
And don't lie like the rest do (Rest do)
You gotta figure out (Hah)
I'm not like the other guy (Don't be like those other guys)
Not like the other guy

Heartfelt, unselfish love
All thoughts revolve around you

Uh, I mean
I just... I don't understand
I mean, I know what you had and what you been through
But I'm here and I'm different (Ay, ay)

Girl, you just don't realize (You don't realize)
(You gotta figure out, oh, yeah)
You gotta figure out
I'm not like the other guy (Not like those other guys, oh-wow)
(Don't be like those other guys)
Because I wear saggy jeans, tim boots
And don't lie like the rest do (Rest do)
You gotta figure out (Oh)
I'm not like the other guy (You realize)
Not like the other guy (I'm not the like other guy)
Hey-hey
