I know that you've been saying
That things haven't turned out within the way that you had always planned
I'm here girl for the taking
It's time to be more than just friends
I wanna be (Your every hour man)
The one that you will always know
Will always be (Doing all I can)
To show you on the real who I be
I tell you, if you just ask me

I tell you what U get is all of me, fantasy
Anything you need
Every chance I get I'll shower you, how I do
Just to prove to you
Tell you what U get is just the truth, you can't lose
When I get to you
All them fairytale stories that your momma told ya
It's what U get girl

Girl I don't mean to be pushy
But I know that you and me should be here living out this fantasy
I love you but I'm fading, I've been waiting here so patiently
I'm ready girl to be (Your every hour man)
The one that you will always know
Will always be (Doing all I can)
To be there if you ask me, if you wanna be
You might also like
I tell you what U get is all of me, fantasy
Anything you need
Every chance I get I'll shower you, how I do
Just to prove to you
Tell you what U get is just the truth, you can't lose
When I get to you
All them fairytale stories that your momma told ya
It's what U get girl

I never thought I'd ever want to be an on-the-lock one-girl man
But you've changed me and I
I don't wanna spend my time without you

I tell you what U get is all of me, fantasy
Anything you need
Every chance I get I'll shower you, how I do
Just to prove to you
Tell you what you get is just the truth, you can't lose
When I get to you
All them fairytale stories that your momma told ya
It's what U get girl
