O, tell 'em what's up

Shorty was 5'5, hair cut like a bowl
Lookin' like a model from the cover of Vogue
Sexy mama, body bangin' out of control
She lookin' at me, but I ain't fa sho
She was the hottest girl I ever seen before
Said to myself, "Gotta get her, fa sho"
Stepped up to her with my playa approach
And said, "Hey, little lady, please give me your name and..."

What up there, shorty?
Lookin' sexy in your jeans there, shorty (Whoa)
Got me actin' like a fiend there, shorty
So girl won't you come and be my shorty, uh, uh
(Be my shorty)

Lookin' sexy in your jeans there, shorty
Got me actin' like a fiend there, shorty
So girl won't you come and be my shorty, uh, uh

For the first five minutes she was sweatin' me
But I could tell that she liked the way I sag my jeans
I said, "Sweetie, do you wanna take a ride with me?"
Told my boys that she could be the one for me
So I said, "Baby, can I be the man you need?"
Holla at me, mami, if you feelin' me"
I whispered in her ear and she smiled at me
I said, "Hey, little shorty, will you be my girlfriend?"

What up there, shorty?

So girl won't you come and be my shorty, uh, uh

Saditty and pretty, just how I like 'em
When a girl talk mess, she always down to fight 'em
A thug appeal that's real, she don't say "hi"
She like, "Yo, what's the deal?" Come on
(Now catch the Dreux)
A girl that pop her collar, that'll make her own dollar
She don't like a Benz, she like a 6-4 Impala
One that can hold her own, sneak me in when pops is home
Tuck the chrome and say she love me in a sexy tone
What up there, shorty?
Lookin' sexy in your jeans there, shorty
Got me actin' like a fiend there, shorty (Yeah)
