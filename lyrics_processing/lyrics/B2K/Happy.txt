Didn't take long to get over you (guess what)

Shorty, it was only one mistake
Can you forgive me? (no)
You and me

I can't let you go no (oh it's like that)
One more time girl you know I got you
You know I'll take care of you
Give you anything
Be the man you want me to be
Your everything
You know I love you

Girl I love you

Come on now girl
Lemme show you
(What ever)
I know I was wrong
Then you shoulda kept a smile on my face
I got a smile on my face
Don't trip,didn't take long to get over you (guess what)
I'm good,ain't got no attitude
Found another lover quick,by loving you
And that's the truth...boy
