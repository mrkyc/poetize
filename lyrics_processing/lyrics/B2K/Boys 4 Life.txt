Yo, why ya'll have to bring this up man?
I mean it ain't like I forgot but it's like I wasn't thinkin about it man
Now that you wanna talk about it... You got me all watery in the eyes ya
Know but uh it's all good I wanna tell you all 3 I love y'all like ya'll
Love me but if y'all know what I'm talkin about Fizz holla at cha boy
(Rap 1:)
For the first 3 yrs
We was on coat fax
No deals no money
But everybody had our back
We knew it would happen and that for a fact
Until then we was washing cars, visiting laundromats
Scrounging up change for a meal at pizza guy
No ride to Roscoe's
We made our own sunrise
Getting sick off cheetoes
Skittles and benekos
Marq yelling cause we eat his last taqeto
Wishing for a bank account with at least 2 zero's
Playing ball all day
Sharing one Gatorade
No dogs of our own
So we walked Bear and Jane
Playing B-B bridges
Hopping over gates
Just to go swimming
Yeah we were bad
Tryna holla at older women
Man
Times was hard
You know we didn't get much
But we had each other and man that was enough
You might also like(Chorus:)
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
We are still friends til the end
Ups and downs
Yeah dats a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
(Rap 2:)
Its getting hard now
What are we to do now
Years is passing
Its time to make a moves now
We got our act together
Faced the bad wheater
Told ourselves its either now or never
So we grabbed our stuff
And started shopping at lables
Perform demos and did whatever it takes
Damn every label slammed the door in our face
But we kept our heads up until we found the right place
(Chorus:)
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
We are still friends til the end
Ups and downs
Yeah dats a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
(Rap 3:)
We found a home now
It's on
We in the game now
Chris and Max done made this thing crack now
Now we work with Tom and Polly with Dee Mack now
Took us a while but we got a name now
A platinum album with dough up in the bank now
No more lounging around, we businessmen now
Epic helped us and put us in the right gear
Video and radio thanks for the great year
I'm glad the time that it took was a struggle
To when this time came we would be greatful and humble
We thank God for making all this happen for us
We thank all our fans for having love in us
Ah come on
(Chorus:)
We been through thick and thin
But we still here
No matter what goes down
We are still friends til the end
Ups and downs
Yeah dats a hard-knock life
Yeah its ride or die
Cause we are boys for life
(Hook 3x:)

Thank God that you brought the joy to me

I love y'all just like y'all love me
(J-Boog Talking)
