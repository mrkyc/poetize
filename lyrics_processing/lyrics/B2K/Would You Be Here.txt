Girl, if I didn't have a plan
Could I be your man still? Uh-uh-uh, baby
And if you couldn't watch cable
Would you be able to understand?
And if I couldn't buy you diamond rings
Take you out and things and do nothing special
Would you deal? Would you stick around and chill?
Would you keep it real? Tell me

Would you be here if I had nothing?
Would you be here if I was struggling?
If I had nothing, would you be here at any cost?
Would you be here if I didn't have a boss, at any cost?
Would you be here to pay the rent?
Would you be here, no benefits?
Girl, if that was it, would you be here if I gave up?
Straight out of love, would you give a what?

Girl, if all hope is gone, we didn't have a phone
Would you stay at home with me
And how long would you stay by my side
If I applied and wasn't qualified, baby? Mmm
What if I was finished
And you couldn't do nothing else with it
Would you forget it?
Girl, do you swear to tell the whole truth
Nothing but the truth?
I'm listening, baby, oh

The day may come when things ain't going too good
So for my sake I gotta be sure
Who I'm choosing is all the way wit' it, yeah
And I'm lying, I don't wanna get caught in a sticky situation
'Cause you never know, might not be so cold, huh
Might get a little older, oh
