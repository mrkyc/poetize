I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
Ay yo yo, Dave Mack
You know we had to go and do a remix
It just wouldn't be right, baby
B2K, flip it

Just copped a Bentley and it's parked in my garage
A 2 o' clock appointment for my massage
And everywhere they go they know just who we are
There they go, it's them ghetto superstars

The latest throw backs and the ones on my feet
So girl watch yourself 'cuz I'm tryin' to keep 'em clean
All of the hunnies go from Black to Japanese
But yet still there's just this one thing that I need
[Chorus}
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
You might also likeI need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I know all ya out there in ya cars n' jeeps
But what I want ya to do for me is get out ya car right now
And party in the streets, c'mon

Chillen in my hummy, it's about that time
Shorty wit her man, I'm 'bout to make her mine
She lookin' at Fizz like a man of shine
Oh, it ain't no doubt, we gon bump and grind
I see this girl eyein' me 'cause my body is shine
It's just a matter of time before I, the line
Don't ever chase her 'cause I got so much paper
That they all up wit me
I got a fat Excursion, that's about a block long
And a fat crib that's about a block long
Three hunnies in the mirror just followin' the chrome
Yeah, they wanna get wit the rapper that sings songs
I got the po po, followin' the limo
Yeah, I'm somewhere in the van chillen wit this hunnie
And plus I got this thick chick fellin' on me
Yeah, I sho love to see her hips roll fo me
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I know all ya out there in ya cars n' jeeps
But what I want ya to do for me is get out ya car right now
And party in the streets, c'mon
B2K and pi pi piper
