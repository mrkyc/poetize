Once again
Listen

I've been goin' through some things (Oh)
I struggle with my inner man (Yeah, yeah)
I hustle, I'll do what I can
To get this money (Uh, yeah, listen)
I know I promised you some things (Some things)
There's gotta be a better way
It's not easy to make that change
The streets keep callin' me

Last night tryna make it home (Make it home)
I get this call on my phone (On my cell)
Stop yellin', slow down, I can't understand a word you sayin'
Did you say my nigga got hit? (In the head)
Did you say he didn't make it? (Is he dead?)
Please tell me you know who did this
I'm on my way and somebody's gonna get it
Mash the pedal on the highway (Speedin')
And my baby in the background (Pleadin')
"Come home and leave it alone"
It's out of the question, girl, it's on
"What about his newborn child?
And you know that he was wild"
I don't wanna hear this shit right now
When they just stretched my nigga out
You might also like
I've been goin' through some things (Some things)
I struggle with my inner man
I hustle, I'll do what I can
To get this money (Yeah, yeah)
I know I promised you some things
There's gotta be a better way (Yeah, baby)
It's not easy to make that change
The streets keep callin' me (Streets keep callin' me)

By my name, sayin', "How you gonna get paid?" (You know you need that)
No education equals minimum wage (You gotta get it)
Minimum wage equals minimum play
And you know real niggas wanna play
Won't you come on and move this way?
School don't guarantee a higher pay
That's the shit that'll get me locked away
Man, they tryna give a nigga all day
Now I'm out here every night comin' in late
If you slip, then I'm comin' for the take
It's goin' fast and I need to hit the brakes
The greater the risk, the more you make
All my thoughts are in the clouds
What about just shuttin' down?
But girl, I really can't quit right now
Notice on the door, they tryna throw us out
I've been goin' through some things (Through some things)
I struggle with my inner man (Inner man)
I hustle, I'll do what I can
To get this money (To get this money, woah, woah)
I know I promised you some things (I never)
There's gotta be a better way (Gotta be a better way)
It's not easy to make that change
The streets keep callin' me

Although (Although)
I was raised right (Ooh-hoo)
Still these streets ain't nothin' nice (Streets ain't nothin' nice)
They can't change the course of life
And you know that I know (I know)
That I must grow (Must grow)
To see my kids grow
But still the streets is all I know

I've been goin' through some things (I've been really goin' through some shit)
I struggle with my inner man (Yeah, yeah)
I hustle, I'll do what I can
To get this money (To make this money, baby)
I know I promised you some things (Oh, oh-woah)
There's gotta be a better way (Gotta be a better way)
It's not easy to make that change
The streets keep callin' me (Said the streets keep callin' me, yeah)
I've been goin' through some things (Yeah)
I struggle with my inner man (I've been goin' through)
I hustle, I'll do what I can
To get this money (Hey)
I know I promised you some things
There's gotta be a better way (They want me back down)
It's not easy to make that change (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The streets keep callin' me (Ooh, woah)
I've been goin' through some things
I struggle with my inner man
I hustle, I'll do what I can
To get this money
I know I promised you some things
