Why, why would you make me feel this way (Why)
Make me feel like we would never separate (Separate)
Make me feel like you wanted to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

"Like best friends" were the words you said to me
Got me wondering to myself how could this be
They way we touched was more than a fantasy
Just knew that what we had was more reality
My wifey is who I thought you'd be
Maybe one day raise a C-H-I-L-D
Broke my heart when you didn't wanna be with me
And all this time I was a fool in L-O-V-E

Why, why would you make me feel this way (Why)
Make me feel like we would never separate (Separate)
Make me feel like you wanted to be my girl (My girl, my girl, my girl)
But knowing you only wanted to be friends
Why, why would you make me feel this way (Feel this way)
Make me feel like we would never separate (Separate)
Make me feel like you wanted to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends
You might also like
Beautiful, baby that was you and I
Now everyday I got to sit and wonder why
The way we kissed, got a feeling deep inside
What I'm hearing girl, it has to be a lie
How could you, just keep me to the side
You never even gave this thing a T-R-Y
Don't understand these things you try to hide
Now all the sudden you been actin F-U-N-N-Y
And why

How could you do this to me (How)
You led me to believe you want me (You want me)
Now I can't change how I feel inside (I can't change)
Girl tell me why (Why)

Why, why would you make me feel this way (Why'd you make me feel this way)
Make me feel like we would never separate (Separate)
Make me feel like you wanted to be my girl (My girl, be my girl)
But knowing you only wanted to be friends (To be friends)
Why, why would you make me feel this way (Why would you)
Make me feel like we would never separate (Separate)
Make me feel like you wanted to be my girl (You wanted to be my girl)
But knowing you only wanted to be friends (My one and only girl)
Oh yea
Baby
You wanted to be
You wanted to be

Why, why would you make me feel this way (Why did you) (Feel this way)
Make me feel like we would never separate (Separate)
Make me feel like you wanted to be my girl (What's wrong with you, why'd you play with me)
But knowing you only wanted to be friends (We're supposed to be family)
Why, why would you make me feel this way (Oh no)
Make me feel like we would never separate (Make me feel this way)
Make me feel like you wanted to be my girl (Be my girl)
But knowing you only wanted to be friends
Why, why would you make me feel this way (Why would you make me feel this way)
Make me feel like we would never separate (Never separate)
