I'm young, like to hang with my crew, have fun
But it seems like all the girls I know
Never understood that flow
Like this one ,when i first met her she was so cool
But when I told her I need space, she got all in my face
Realizing what I need, the kind of girl to be for me
Now I see it's going to take some understanding

To be the one I'm looking for
The perfect one i need
You gotta be sexy and secure
And be understanding
'Cause I'm the kinda guy that likes to twerk
No drama that's just me
If you wanna be the one I want
Then be understanding

One girl, she had a little game, personality for days
Insane, the cutest little hottie chick
She had the body and wit to go with it
But she had a problem with insecurity, jealousy with me
I'm not the one for drama though so, I had to let her go
Realizing what I need, the kind of girl to be for me
'Cause now I see it's going to take some understanding

To be the one I'm looking for
The perfect one i need
You gotta be sexy and secure
And be understanding
'Cause I'm the kinda guy that likes to twerk
No drama that's just me
If you wanna be the one I want
Then be understanding

If you understand me (If you understand me)
Take my hand and show me (Show me girl that you)
That you can be all I need
And we can fall in love
To be the one I'm looking for
The perfect one i need
You gotta be sexy and secure
And be understanding
'Cause I'm the kinda guy that likes to twerk
No drama that's just me
If you wanna be the one I want

You gotta be sexy and secure
And be understanding
