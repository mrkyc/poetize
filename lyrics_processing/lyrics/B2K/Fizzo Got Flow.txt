One,Two,Three,Four
Fizzo came though and Im blazin out the door
Hold five to six hoes causin frenzies while round the globe
And my belly stay froze cause chain hang low
Now Im gettin it paid every single day
Wit my niggas my niggas Chris and J
Now its best yall move out my way
Cause yall been havin bad days every since I took place
Dudes wit fast names can't seem to win a race
Dont try to spit dog if you can't you can't make a hit
Dont try to make her shake if she dont move like a snake
Throw it on her like a champion
Bouncin like a trampline
I tellin you sweet things you think I mean
Its only right that we get this green
If the game is open
Im taking it like Ivy
If rap was ball
I'd have points like Kobe (ya heard)
(chorus)2x
Fizzo got flow
The fizzo got flow (what)
Fizzo got flow
The fizzo got flow (c'mon)
Fizzo got flow
The fizzo got flow you think you know but you have no idea
You might also like(verse2)
I came in this game abrupt
Ya'll said whos him
Slim wit the tilted brim on powder blue tims
Wasn't wrong long 'fore I filled my chain wit gems
Turned linen to benz brought a e-class benz
Now yall wanna say how we speak so fluent
How we keep the crowds moving
Our hope is neva truent
Do I have to say that Im betta then yall
When ya album can't compare to my sixteen bars
Yall got me confused I dont kick it wit nerds
Ima grown man yall kids like Big Bird
Look dog I dont think you heard
Hit em up spit em up get it em up word
(chorus)4x
(Talking)
This is ridiculous man
No this is hideous (its crazy)
No ima tell you what it is
Its a god damn shame... Its a got damn shame
It's tha R R Kelly... Holla
