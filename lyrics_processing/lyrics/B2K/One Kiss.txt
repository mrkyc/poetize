She was so sincere
The way she grabbed my hand
And introduced herself
Like no one else has done before
And I can't lie
I was hypnotized
By the smile, and the talk and the style of the walk
And when she tried to kiss me
I just (sighed)
Said to myself that this can't be (real)
I lied to my mind but my heart it could (feel)
Something was wrong (Don't worry)
That's what she said (Now I)
Look back on the night that changed my (life)
I remember the things
That made me call that night
And to think that I betrayed me for one kiss

One kiss for all my trust
One kiss for all my love (one kiss)
One kiss caused me to break
One kiss
I just hate it
One kiss
One kiss
One kiss (one kiss)
That's where I started feeling
One kiss felt so good
But I never shoulda had that kiss
You might also like
I was so far gone
She could do no wrong
'Til I caught her in the act
Downright gettin' it on
How could I not see
That eventually she would break my heart
Where did it all start
It started with a little bitty kiss

One kiss for all my trust (ohh I)
One kiss for all my love (one kiss)
One kiss cause me to break
One kiss
I just hate it (i just hate it)
One kiss
One kiss (one kiss)
One kiss (one kiss)
That's where I started feeling
One kiss felt so good
But I never shoulda had that kiss

Mistook that kiss for kindness
How could I be so blinded
Shoulda read
Instead I
Made it easy ooooh
But I won't let my heart get hurt (ooh)
It was all about a lesson learned (ooh)
And the lesson (ooh) that I learned was (ooh) taught to me by (ooh)
One kiss
