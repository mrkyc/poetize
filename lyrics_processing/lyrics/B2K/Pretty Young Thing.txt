Uh, yeah, yo check it out
It's B2K, uh, what, Platnium Status, uh
She's a pretty young thing, uh, uh, a pretty young thing
What
Uh

She put it down, she put the thang on me
Without a doubt, I know that she's wifey
Workin' it out, makin' me feel freaky
But I don't mind, she's all I need
Making the moves, keepin' a brotha thinkin'
I do the same, keepin' her *** fiendin'
You know my name, ain't no replacing me
'Cause I'm a man and I'm all she needs

Pretty young thing, you give me lovin'
While them other girls out there buggin'
You keep it comin', my pretty young thing
So understanding, you never need another man and
With you my life I'm plannin'
'Cause through the rain, you're still my pretty young thing

She put it down, she put the thang on me
Without a doubt, I know that she's wifey
Workin' it out, makin' me feel freaky
But I don't mind, she's all I need
Making the moves, keepin' a brotha thinkin'
I do the same, keepin' her *** fiendin'
You know my name, ain't no replacing me
'Cause I'm a man and I'm all she needs

I love girls screamin' my name while I'm spittin' this game
It's hard to maintain doin' a hundred in the slow lane
Seein' chicks go insane in the membrane
But through all of this, ma, you never changed
Still act vain, still the same plain Jane
Never think I'm cheatin' when my phone is outta range
These other girls is lame, they not on the same page
Don't believe your friends, you still my pretty young thing

Pretty young thing, you give me lovin'
While them other girls out there buggin'
You keep it comin', my pretty young thing (Keep it comin')
So understanding, you never need another man and
With you my life I'm plannin'
'Cause through the rain, you're still my pretty young thing
Pretty young thing, you give me lovin'
While them other girls out there buggin'
You keep it comin', my pretty young thing
So understanding, you never need another man and
With you my life I'm plannin'
'Cause through the rain, you're still my pretty young thing
(Pretty young thing)
