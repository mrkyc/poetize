Man, how this happen? Mmm
Listen, baby, I know I messed up, and I know you wanna leave
But I wanna do things different this time
Please don't go, hear what I gotta say

I remember like it was yesterday
Had everything under control
Stayed out all night with my boys
I took advantage of your love
Then one day you peeped my game
Now suddenly everything has changed
Never thought that you would go, oh no
But now I'm missing you so

If I gotta spend another day without you
I don't know what I might do (I might do)
I don't wanna think of living without you (No no)
'Cause baby, I'm not finished loving you
Monica, Keisha, girl, I'll let 'em go (Let 'em go)
'Cause they don't compare to you (To you)
I don't wanna spend another day without you
'Cause baby, I'm not finished loving you
You might also like
I didn't know how much you meant to me
When I looked up you were gone
Now I realize you're my destiny
That's why I'm singing this song
Baby, come back to me (Baby, come back to me)
I'm on my bended knee (I'm on my bended knee)
You are my everything (Everything)
Girl, I, I need you, I need you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If I gotta spend another day without you
I don't know what I might do
I don't wanna think of living without you
'Cause baby, I'm not finished loving you
(I'm not finished loving you, baby, yeah)
Monica, Keisha, girl, I'll let 'em go (Let 'em go)
'Cause they don't compare to you (Nobody)
I don't wanna spend another day without you
'Cause baby, I'm not finished loving you

I'll do what I gotta do to get you
To love me the way you did before
Before I was taking your love for granted
You're always on my mind
Every day (Every day), and every night (Every night)
I think about how to make it right (Make it right)
All I wanna do is be with you (You you you you)
I gotta let you know I miss you
I miss, miss, miss, miss you
I really miss, miss, miss, miss you
I wanna kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss you
Girl, I, I need you, I need you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I gotta spend another day without you (I can't)
I don't know what I might do (Ooh yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I don't wanna think of living without you
'Cause baby (Baby), I'm not finished loving you
(Not finished loving you, baby)
Monica, Keisha, girl, I'll let 'em go (Let 'em go)
'Cause they don't compare to you (Nobody)
I don't wanna spend another day without you
'Cause baby, I'm not finished loving you

If I gotta spend another day without you
I don't know what I might do
(I don't know what I might do)
I don't wanna think of living without you
(Thinking of living)
'Cause baby, I'm not finished loving you
