Darling, when my back's to you
My heart beats fast
And every little thing you do makes me feel so bad
There's something 'bout your smiling face
That puts me in the mood
You see, i just wanna touch you
You don't know how much you make me feel so good, baby

Giving me the good vibration (Feels so good)
Don't you know you're a sweet?
And I like it, baby (I like it, baby)

And it feels so good
You do so much for me, what no other woman could
You've got the personality
I've always hoped for
The things that you do for me, how could I ask for much more?
