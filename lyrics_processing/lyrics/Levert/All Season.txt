My, my, my baby, baby
Love you all over

If you were my woman
And I was your man
I'd give you everything you desire
See, it's a shame
He don't treat you right
With me it'd be an everlasting fire

Whenever you need me
I'll be right by your side
To keep you warm when the nights are cold
Whenever you need me
I'll come running to you
'Cause I don't need a reason
To love you for all seasons

Winter, spring, summer, fall
(Winter, spring, summer, fall)
I'll give you my all
There's plenty of love (Love, love)
I promise baby
Winter, spring, summer, fall
I'll give you my all (Give you my all)
I don't need a reason
To love you all seasons
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

I'll keep you smiling (Smile)
Turn that frown upside down
I want you to feel sexy every day
I'll keep you happy baby
Your wish is my command
And I don't need a reason
To love you for all seasons

Winter, spring, summer, fall
