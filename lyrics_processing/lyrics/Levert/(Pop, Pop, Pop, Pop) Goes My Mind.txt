La, la, la, la, la, la, la, da
Ooh, hoo, hoo, oh, no, no

I remember when you
Said I was the only one that you would give your love to
Your love was so strong
Baby, I admit I was wrong

Can we try to start it over? (Ba, ba, ba, ba)
Or has your love run out for me?
Tell me that you love me, girl
Baby, please have pity on me, baby, yeah

Pop, pop, pop, pop, goes my mind (My mind)
Every time I think of all the times I did you wrong
Pop, pop, pop, pop, goes my mind
Goes my mind

I never wanted you to leave
I tried to love you the best I could
But baby, now I see, girl
My best, my best was no good
No, no, no, no, no

So please, don't say you're leaving me (Ba, ba, ba, ba)
See, I can't stand to see you cry
Tell me that you love me, girl
But I don't know, I don't know why
My mind keeps saying, keeps telling me

Pop, pop, pop, pop goes my mind (My mind)
Every time I think of all the times I did you wrong, baby
Pop, pop, pop, pop, goes my mind
Baby, my love was so strong

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Tell me that you love me, girl
See, I don't know, I don't know why
My mind keeps saying, keeps telling me
Pop, pop, pop, pop goes my mind (My mind)
When I think of all the times
All the times that I said I didn't love you, baby
(Pop, pop) Goes my mind
Remembering the times, remembering the times I needed, needed you

Oh baby (Every time I think of how I loved you)
Baby, baby, baby (Pop, pop), baby, baby, baby, baby
All the times that I did you wrong, baby
(Knowing that I can't do without you)
(Pop, pop) Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop goes my mind
(Knowing that, I can't do without you) My mind
(Pop, pop, my mind) Oh girl, girl, girl, girl
(Every time I think about how I love you, pop, pop)
I never wanted to hurt you girl
I only wanted to love, to love you, baby
