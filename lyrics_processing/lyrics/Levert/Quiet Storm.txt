No one to talk to 'cause you're gone
Without you here the nights are long
So I turn the radio on
Hope they play my favorite song
I called on the line
To make a special request
And I say it all on the radio
To the girl I love the best
From me to you, ooh
Quiet storm
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh)
Quiet storm
(Oh, you, you, you, you, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Quiet storm
Sending, sending out my song to you
On a quiet storm, baby
No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You so near but yet so far
The music is soothing
But I still need to be where you are
So baby, I'm ready, the feeling is real
I wanna do things so baby, please say you will
