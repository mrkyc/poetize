(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
You know, every house has a door
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
And every room has a floor
Every fence has a gate (And every beast has a mate)

Everybody, everybody's got something but me
I ain't got nothing

(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
Every stove has a fire
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
And every car has a tire
Every fish has a bowl (And every shoe has a sole)

Everybody, everybody's got something but me
I ain't got nothing

Now I don't care about politics
And things across the sea (Across the sea)
All I wanna to do is love
And have somebody love me
I need, I need somebody

Every lion has a den
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
And every little pig has its pen
Every road has a way (And they tell me every dog has its day)

Everybody (Woo-hoo), everybody's got something but me
I ain't got nothing
I ain't got nothing, oh no
I ain't got nothing
I ain't got nothing, oh no
Mhm
I ain't got nothing, oh no
I ain't got nothing
I ain't got nothing, oh no
I ain't got nothing
I ain't got nothing, oh no
I ain't got nothing
I ain't got nothing, oh no
