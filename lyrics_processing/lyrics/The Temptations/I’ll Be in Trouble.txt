If you decide to make me blue, I'll be in trouble
If you decide to be untrue, I'll be in trouble
'Cause no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in trouble

If you decide one day you want to make a change, love
You want to leave me here and love a total stranger
Well, no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in danger

I'll do everything I can to make you stay
To keep you by my side (By my side, baby)
'Cause I love you in such a way
I forget all about my pride

If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble

Oh yeah
Mmhmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmhmm
