Girl, I can't believe my ears
Are you really telling me goodbye?
See, you're taking away my reason for living
And you won't even tell me why
Before you walk out the door
There's something I want you to know

That I could never, ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other love would I share (I could never love another)
'Cause none could compare
After loving you

It was only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
Baby, you said long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you wanna leave me behind
Listen, baby
I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay
I just know I've got to find a way
