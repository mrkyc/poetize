Try to remember when life was so tender
That love was young and oh, so mellow
Try to remember, it's nice to remember
When dreams were kept beside your pillow
Try to remember, it's nice to remember
When love was an ember about to billow
Deep in December, our hearts should remember
And follow
Follow (Follow, follow, follow, follow)

Deep in December, ooh, it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made us mellow
Deep in December, our hearts should remember
And follow (Won't you follow?)
Follow (Won't you follow?)
