Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
And oh baby (Oh baby)

I cry myself to sleep at night
For fear of another holdin' you tight and oh baby
(Oh baby)
I miss you more with each passin' day
Every night on my knees I pray oh

Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love I'm just no good
I am just a lonely one

I'm sorry for the wrong I've done
Now I know how it feels to lose that special someone
And oh baby (Oh baby)
I need you more than words can say
Without your love I can pass another day

Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love I'm just no good
And oh baby

And oh baby (Oh baby)
I can't control this growin' need
Girl come and see about me

Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love I'm just no good
