Ooh

Lonely man am I
Ever since you said goodbye
Girl I know that I should have woke up
'Cause it seems now that we've broke up
Your farewell kiss is haunting me
My two lips cry out constantly
Let your heart, let your heart be your guide
Forget about your foolish pride

Starting tomorrow, I keep telling myself (I need ya, baby, I need ya)
I'm gonna get out and find me somebody else (I need ya, baby, I need ya)
Somebody that's sweet and kind (I need ya, baby, I need ya)
Who will erase you out of my mind
But tell me how can I find somebody new baby? (It's you that I need)
When my two arms keep reaching out for you (It's you that I need)
And my two lips keep right on repeating (It's you that I need)
It's you that I need, ooh (Baby, I need you)

You know that even when I close my eyes to forget ya
I see your face and your memories too
Girl, I've never felt this loneliness before
And hoo, girl I just can't take it no more
Every night a million tears I shed
Girl, I'm slowly goin' out of my head
Just take a good look and you'll see
What this loneliness is doin' to me

Ooh (Don't you know that it's you that I need)
Oh, I can't take this loneliness (Baby, you that I need)
Oh baby, I need ya (Don't you know that it's you that I need)
Ooh (Baby, I need you)

Some fool I'm gonna be no more (It's you that I need)
'Cause I'll soon be knockin', knockin' on your door (Oh, it's you that I need)
Gonna get down on my bended knees (Oh, it's you that I need)
Beg and plead (It's you that I need)
Girl, come back to me (Baby, I need you)

It's you that I need (Every night a million tears I shed)
Girl, it's you that I need (Girl, I'm slowly goin' out of my head)
Girl, take a good look and see
What this loneliness is (It's you that I need)
