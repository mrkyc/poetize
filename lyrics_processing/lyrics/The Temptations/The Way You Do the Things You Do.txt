You've got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could have been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could have been some perfume

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do (Ah baby)
The way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are (Ooh-hoo)
You know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute (Ooh-hoo)
You know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart (Ooh-hoo)
You know you could have been a cool crook
And baby you're so smart (Ooh-hoo)
You know you could have been a schoolbook
