I just want a dime
'Cause I need a cup of coffee
And a moment of your time
I can tell your raised in hell
The way I used to do
But I wish someone had to talked to me
Like I wanna talk to you
Listen
I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
Stole a woman in Tennessee
(Stole a women, Tennessee)
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
(freeee)
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise (I've been to paradise)
But I've never been to me
Thanks mister, thanks mister
But please don't walk away
(I have this neeeeed)
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
(I can see, so much of me still living in your eyes)
Won't you share a part of an old man's heart
Just once before he dies

On any ship that would sail
Made some noise with some good old boys
(Made some noise with some good old boys)
And we wrecked southern jail
I've seen the best men crawl and some teardrops fall
There ain't nothing I didn't see
(Nothing I didn't see)
I've been to paradise (I've been to paradise)
But I've never been to me
I've even, been to marriage
Children cry for someone they couldn't find
Never knowing that I was searching
For things I left behind
I thought my heart could wait
But I learned too late
Only love can make people free
I've been to paradise (I've been to paradise)
I've been to paradise
But I've never been (never been)
Toooo meee
(Been to Georgia, California, anywhere I could run)
Oh yeah, can't you see?
(Stole a woman in Tennessee)
Listen to me
(Made love in the sun)
I don't want you to make the same mistakes I've made
(But I ran out of places, friendly faces)
Oh no, I've been to paradise
('Cause I had to be free)
I have even been there twice
(I've been to paradise)
Oooh weah, hey hey
I know you want to, you wanna be free
My son, please, please listen to me
I I I I I I
(I've been to paradise)
I wanna help you, huh
Oh no
I've never been to me
Don't walk away, oh no
(I've been to paradise)
I got more, I got more
I got more to say hey
I've seen the best man crawl and some teardrops fall
I've been all over the world
(I've been to paradise)
Oh, no no, oh yeah
So I can let you see
So you can have just a judgement of this time
I believe I can get older
(I've been to paradise)
I can get across
I can get through
I can get next to the man
Hey I got to, I got to talk to him
I didn't have the chance myself
I wish somebody would've
I wish they could've just talk to me
(I've been to paradise)
Like I want to talk to you
