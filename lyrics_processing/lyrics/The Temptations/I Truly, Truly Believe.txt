I'm sending red roses and violets of blue, girl (Violets of blue, girl)
The roses mean I love you
The violets mean I'll always be true, girl (Be true, girl)

'Cause I really love you ('Cause I really love you)
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do (Yes I do)
In spite of the way you're acting that you love me too
Say you do

You try to keep me away, girl
To prove that you don't really care
But I believe you feel the same as I do
And this torture just ain't fair (No, this torture just ain't fair)
I'm sending you a bracelet engraved in gold (Sending you a bracelet baby)
With, "I love you girl" (Love you, girl)
And I'd send my heart if I could to prove I'll always be true

'Cause I really love you ('Cause I really love you)
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do (Yes I do)
That you love me too
Say you love me, 'cause I love you

And that bright shining bracelet helps me to say I love you (I love you, love you)
