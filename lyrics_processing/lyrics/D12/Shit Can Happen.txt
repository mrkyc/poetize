Bitch
Yeah
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen
Shit can happen, shit can happen

That's right motherfuckers, we back
Same slanging, orangatanging, wilding out on hoodrats
They say I act like I'm too famous to say "Hi"
And tell 'em what my name is, but really I'm still nameless
You niggas don't get it yet, do you?
Deal or not, platinum or flop, I still put it through you
With a Luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal wit' you in front of St. Andrew's still?
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that roll you got, you gon' see these Runyon Ave. niggas that really need some Prozac
Fo' sho' that, ask the others, Brigade'll lay you down
Next to your mother's mother's grandmother

You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight, ready to fight (What up, dawg?)
And half the niggas I give dap to I don't even like (What up?)
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it like the next L.A. Clippers' game (Fucking bitch)
I kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom (Punk)
You and your madame, it's really unexplainable how I have 'em (That's right)
Who call theyself screaming about a challenge (What?)
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off mere talent
My skills are deeply embedded even your ho said it (Uh-huh)
She was knock kneed, I fucked her, now she's bow-legged
In the middle of rapping, I drop the mic (What?)
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping (Bitch)
Kuniv' and Kon Artis, my nigga, we get it cracking (That's right)
While the paramedics pick you up, we on the side, laughing (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

Shit can happen
Now this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
Shit can happen
You can be touched, don't think you can't
Shit can happen
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more, man
Shit can happen
This ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
Shit can happen
You can be touched, don't think you can't
Shit can happen
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more, man

The feds can't hold me (Why?), I hold feds
I was born with a dark ass cloud over my head (Uh-huh)
Raining acid (Man), you can't refrain from getting yo' ass kicked
'Cause you talk too much, you asked for it (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm on some massive shit, everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy
These niggas get confronted, then they change stories (What up now?)
I cut you and they thinking everything's hunky dory
I even have you pouring me the gasoline for me
Pulling up slowly, cocktailing your homie
You met a lot of niggas, but you wouldn't wanna know me (For real)
Yo' ass might not even make it home wit' your Rollie
Don't even try, in your system like E. coli
Trying to beef with me, nigga please, yo' people die
I'm so wicked that my mama gave birth illegally (Uh-huh)
I survived the abortion immediately, surprise (Aah!)
Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting (Shit)
Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
So when the cops come knocking each hand's got one
Cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shotputs
One man army, guns can't harm me
Young and ornery, worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop airing out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flipped at censorship
Your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I've been giving it a hundred and ten percent
'Cause when I vent, most of my energy's spent on enemies
Eighty percent of what I invent is Hennessy (*burp*)
Twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
10's because I love being under your skin, yeah (Shit)
Shit can happen, so stick to rapping
Quit the yapping or I'ma lift the MAC and
That can lead to another mishap happening
Skip the crap, get the can of whoopass cracking

Shit can happen
Now this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
Shit can happen
You can be touched, don't think you can't
Shit can happen
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more, man
Shit can happen
This ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
Shit can happen
You can be touched, don't think you can't
Shit can happen
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin around no more, man
Shit can happen
It can and it will (Nigga, nigga)
Shit can happen
Fuck around with Amityville
Shit can happen
And you die, insanity spills
Shit can happen
From the mentality of twelve motherfuckers
Shit can happen
In six different bodies with their personalities split
Shit can happen
Fucking you up with hit after hit
Shit can happen
Sticking you up with clip after clip
Shit can happen
Making you suck dick after dick
Shit can happen
Dirty motherfucking dozen
Shit can happen
The Kon Artis
Shit can happen
Motherfucking Peter S. Bizarre
Swifty McVay
The Kuniva
Dirty father-fucking Harry
Putting you down in a cemetery
You get buried
All you of you motherfuckers
Suck our motherfucking cocks
We are not playing
We are not playing
We are not bullshitting
This is not a motherfucking joke
