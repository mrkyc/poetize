Daddy?

I wanna be just like you
When I grow up, yes, I do
I wanna be just like you
When I grow up, (Heh, he-he-he-he)  yes, I do
I wanna be just like you (You like)
When I grow up, yes, I do
I wanna be just like you
When I grow up, yes, I do

You don't wanna be just like your daddy
Pimpin' hoes out here drivin' Caddies
Runnin' 'round town, fuckin' with skeezers
Shots in your ass, catchin' diseases
Son, your daddy got a foul mouth
From fuckin' bitches in they foul mouths
I can't help it, my group's D12
All we do is pop pills and stay in jail
Talkin' nasty shit, Bizarre won't stop
I'll fuck two twins, with a midget on top
A sick mind, rapin' an old lady
Knowin' damn well Bizarre shouldn't have a baby
All I can teach you, learn how to mack
Smoke crack, smack a bitch when she talk back
Matter of fact, smack your sister, she's a slut
Don't you realize Bizarre don't give a fuck? (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

Don't go to school, become a Catholic priest
Sell crack to your Auntie Denise
If Auntie Denise is short forty cent
Make her get on the ground and **** some more ****
Nas is gon' probably hate me
When Mos Def hear this, he probably gon' suffocate me
"Why they let Bizarre rap on Hi-Tek track?
All he gon' do is talk about hoes and smoking crack"
If your wife is pregnant - I call her a whore
Leave her no money and go out on tour
Nah-hah, I'm playing, leave her something:
A pack of hot dogs and a fucking dirty muffin
You're my son, I'm trying to teach you something
You're ***** years old? It's time to start fucking
You know, daddy won't give you the wrong advice
Smoke weed and listen to Obie Trice (Ha-ha!)

All I can tell you how to do is pop pills and stay high
And tell a bitch to suck a dick
A-ha! I'm a parent, yeah-yeah!
A motherfuckin' role model
