Yeah! D-Twizzie back up in this bitch!
"Eminem buddies"
Buddy this, nigga

Welcome to D12 World
(Where you can get anything from sex, X, to girls!)
Welcome to D12 World
(Prostitutes and guns, so, fuck the real world!)

Word, word *gibberish*
How do we smoke crack, how do we smoke crack?
How do w-?

Fuck the silly shit, I pull a mac milli quick
When D12 rock his summer it's over with
All these bitches and all these hoes
What the fuck you looking at me for? (You, nigga!)
Oh, yeah, you like my chain
Wanna get your skinny ass up in the Range
I like my bitches raspy and nasty
I like a fat and nasty bitch named Ashley
You might also like
I slide you dope without no procrastination
And you can watch me fuck up your imagination
I'm always getting drunk, and I fiend to smack hoes
I mean it, I leave them screaming like pterodactyls (Ahh!)
This is our world

We'd love to smack you
Hot lead flying with debris and shrapnel
Ripping you to shreds, fucking up your tattoo
Break into your crib, take your records and plaques too

D12 is, that's who! Got you limping
Still popping something purple with a bottle of gin, bitch!
I fuck up your kinship, I lie in this shit
Peep, I stole your mom's jeep and crashed into my street!

Crazy deranged, of course we Shady's gang
Of course we wear clothes with holes and blood stains
No doubt, we shoot badges, born with ski masks
Chew on shrooms, drink booze, and pee acid

Welcome to D12 World

Welcome to D12 World
(Prostitutes and guns, so, fuck the real world!)
Welcome to D12 World
Welcome to D12 World
Ayo, niggas be talking shit, but they laying slump now
I graduated from techs, I grip a pump now
I used to be nice, but nice don't cut it (Cut it)
Now I open they wig, if they don't open my budget, bitch

Them D12 niggas, they be quick to blast
I'll take my shower cap off, and whoop your ass
Stepping to us, you can't be the smartest
Cause you'll get dropped like an Aftermath (Ha!) artist

They catch me mingling by a bitch with class
When she turn I'll be sprinkling some shit in her glass
What part of this you can't understand
I'll emmilliate a man, worse then making a band
Don't be mistaking that man
He'll invite you over
Real fast, and pass your ass a glass of Ebola

I've been doing this for a minute
And I'm starting to see my little brother Caleb
Look more like a star then me
That's why I just started working out
Man, this shit ain't working out
Welcome to D12 World
(Where you can get anything from sex, X, to girls!)
Welcome to D12 World
(Prostitutes and guns, so, fuck the real world!)
Welcome to D12 World
