Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
'Cause what's confusing you is just the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
'Cause what's puzzling you is just the nature of my game
Come on, come on, come on
You might also like
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, ah, yeah
'Cause what's confusing you is just the nature of my game

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, who killed the Kennedys?
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for the troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
And I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politeness
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, oh yeah
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is just the nature of my game
Ah, yeah, get down

What's my name?
What's my name?
Lucifer, that's my name, baby
