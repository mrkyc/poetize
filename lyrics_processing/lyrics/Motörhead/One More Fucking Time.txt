All life is a mystery
All things come to he who waits
All things just a twist of fate
It's just a state of mind
All your time is not your own
It's real hard to find out why
It's real hard to say goodbye
To move on down the line

Both your eyes wide open, you see the shape I'm in
It wasn't of my choosing, it's only bones and skin
And I will plead no contest if loving you's a crime
So go on and find me guilty, just one more fucking time

All your life is in your head
All your dreams are in your sleep
And if your dreams are hid too deep
They're just a waste of time
When you try to chase the dream
You never seem to know the time
You never recognise the signs
And nothing's what it seems
You might also like

And if I would have been a bad man
You would have seen the good in me
You would have seen the other, the good man I can be
But since I am a good man, the same was all the same
Nothing I could do, nothing I could do

All life is a mystery
All things pass you by in time
All things just a perfect crime
It's just the way we are
All instincts let you down
It's not a case of love in vain
It's not a case of love insane
It's enough to break your heart

Both your eyes wide open, you see the shape I'm in
It wasn't my idea that I'd be the one to sin
And so all those years together weren't worth a fucking dime
So go on and find me guilty, just one more fucking time
 2x
All our years together weren't worth a fucking dime
