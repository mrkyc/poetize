Well here babe, look at you
In love with someone else
Turned out like all the others
Leave me by myself
That's how it works I guess
And you like all the rest
Guess I can handle it
If that's the way it is

I'm in love with rock 'n' roll
It satisfies my soul
That's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad
Rock 'n' roll

I never been the one to have no steady girl
I love the way I live, running around the world
I like to fool around, I love to tear 'em down
And when I leave, you love to miss me
When I'm gone

I got rock 'n' roll
It satisfies my soul
That's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad
Rock 'n' roll
(Play it to me)

I can't imagine growing old with anyone
Marching to a different drum
I hear a different song
I swear I love them all
I don't care if they're small
I don't care if they're tall
I love them anyway

I got rock 'n' roll
It satisfies my soul
That's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad
I got rock 'n' roll
Satisfies my soul
If that's how it is, it ain't so bad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
If that's all there is, it ain't so bad
I got rock 'n' roll
It satisfies my soul
That's how it has to be, I won't get mad
I got rock 'n' roll to save me from the cold
And if that's all there is, it ain't so bad
Rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
