I could use some dirty love
You can't abuse my dirty love
That's what I need
To satisfy my greed
Come on over with your dirty love

I wanna taste some dirty love
Don't wanna waste your dirty love
Whatever you got
You bet your life I want the lot
I wanna grab your dirty love
Like this

I gotta have your dirty love
I gotta have your dirty love
I'll show you the way
To dirty love all night, all day
I'm gonna treat you to dirty love
