Can't make out things they said
Too many nights getting out of my head
Must be mad, must be blind
Driving me crazy, right out of my mind

Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine, emergency

Can't think straight, can't decide
Time's running out, nowhere to hide
Where to go, what to do?
Better watch out, they're coming for you

Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine, emergency

Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
Nine nine nine, emergency (Emergency)
