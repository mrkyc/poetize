That can make me feel this way
Gets up close you know, I just ain't got a word to say
Please Don't Touch
I shake so much
Please Don't Touch
I shake so much
Well I get so nervous when I see his eyes that shine
Gets too close and a chill runs down my spine
Please Don't Touch
I shake so much
Please Don't Touch
I shake so much
I don't know why she's got her claws in me
'Cause I ain't fighting baby, can't you see
Sneaking up the stairway, running like a thief
Spend the night shaking like a leaf
Oh I remember the first time I took her to a cheap motel
Well I woke up drunk, you know I felt like Eskimo Nell
Please Don't Touch
I shake so much
Please Don't Touch
