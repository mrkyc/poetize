Teenage baby, you're a sweet young thing
Still tied to Mama's apron strings
I don't even dare to ask your age
It's enough to know you're here backstage

You're jailbait, and I just can't wait
Jailbait baby come on

One taste baby, all I need
My decision made at lightning speed
I don't even want to know your name
It's enough to know you feel the same

Jailbait, I just can't wait
Jailbait baby get down

Hey love that young stuff

Tell me baby, oh you look so fine
Send quivers up and down my spine
I don't care about our different ages
I'm an open book with well thumbed pages
You might also like
Jailbait, I ain't too late
Jailbait baby get down
