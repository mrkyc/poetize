Were you ever lost? Were you ever young?
Were you ever safe, little brother?
Do you see the sense of the evidence?
Are you still part of the struggle?
Did you bang your head? Did you go to bed?
Does it still feel pretty funky?
Lay back and dream in the death machine
Pity you still think like a monkey

Go! Bring it up, bring it down till you hit the ground
Now! Get a rude attitude, turn the world around
Hey! Shall we see? Shall we disagree?
Sing it all in the name of tragedy

Did you ever lie? Ever wonder why
Nobody believed you, honey?
What a pretty smile, drive the people wild
Wonder who ran off with the money
Do you ever change? Is it gonna rain?
Will it bring you pennies from heaven?
Do you know the score? Are you waiting for?
Anxious for the new Armageddon
You might also like
Go! Get it up, get it down till you hit the ground
Now! Cop a rude attitude from the world around
Hey! Shall we see? Shall we disagree?
Sing it all in the name of tragedy


Marbles in your mouth; what's it all about?
Do you know the name of the winner?
If I was to go, would you let it show?
Life is not a TV dinner
If you dream of me, will you ever see?
Do you want a piece of the action?
If I wasn't sure, would you do it more?
Help me to achieve an erection

Go! Get it up, get it down till you hit the ground
Now! Cop a rude attitude, turn the world around
Ooh! Shall we see? Shall we disagree?
All in the name of tragedy
Now! Sing it loud, sing it out, make the people shout
Ooh! Get it all, get it on, get it sorted out
Now! Be a seer, be sincere; can you really see?
