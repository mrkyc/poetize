Just wait
For happy ever after in a never ending summer, can't wait
Passing every mirror just to check you're looking slimmer, lost weight
99 problems, and every single one with a flake
How can you be so sad when everyone around you is okay?

Can't wait
Can't wait

Like ripping off a plaster: be quicker, do it faster, don't wait
Skippin' every meal, now can you feel it gathering pace?
Everyone is famous, line up and take a number, just wait
How can you be cryin' when everyone around you is...

Laughin' all the time, singin' as they go
Lookin' like an ad, drinkin' Diet Coke
Everybody dance, let's breakdown tonight
Making up the lies, keeping up the show
Checkin' out the boys, wearin' summer clothes
Get it while you can
Let's breakdown tonight
I'll just wait

Gimme, gimme, gimme celebrity bikini clickbait
Gimme Stacey Solomon, show me her abdominal plate
Where is my forever? I was promised I was special take take
How can it be normal when everyone around you is...

Laughin' all the time, singin' as they go
Lookin' like an ad, drinkin' Diet Coke
Everybody dance, come on over, let's breakdown tonight
Making up the lies, keeping up the show
Checkin' out the boys, wearin' summer clothes
Get it while you can
If you wanna, let's breakdown tonight

National Breakdown is starting today
Due to lack of interest, it's delayed
Now your 15 minutes turned into 8
I'll take hell now
Give em hell now and heaven can wait
Happy ever after in a never ending summer, just wait
How come you're so sad when almost everyone around is...

Laughin' all the time, singin' as they go
Lookin' like an ad, drinkin' Diet Coke
Everybody dance, come on over, let's breakdown tonight
Making up the lies, keeping up the show
Checkin' out the boys, wearin' summer clothes
Get it while you can
If you wanna, let's breakdown tonight
I'll just wait

Let's breakdown tonight, I'll just wait, wait, wait, wait
Let's breakdown tonight, I'll just wait, wait, wait, wait
Let's breakdown tonight, I'll just wait, wait, wait, wait
