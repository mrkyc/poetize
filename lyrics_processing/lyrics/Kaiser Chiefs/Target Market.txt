The PowerPoint presentation of love
Overhead projectors above
Acetates and lying awake
I go over every mistake I'll make
What a speech, it was pitched just right
Nothing niche, kept proceedings light
Bridesmaid at table 3, I hope that she can see

You are my target market
You're the only one I wanted to impress
My demographic
In a vintage party dress
You are my target market
You're the only one I wanted to impress
I almost had it
A percentage of your interest

The lost art of falling in love
I didn't know how to give up
I came back time and again
Got laughed at by all of your friends
And now the party's over, they're closing the bar
Rattling cans, shaving foam on the car
The last dance, alone on the floor
A heart-shaped dart board on my door

I do believe it might have worked
I thought you smiled in the church
But when these words go round and round
I must admit it's just a sound
It's always in my head
It's always in the back of it
You're always there, I was unprepared, but still

You are my target market
You're the only one I wanted to impress
My demographic
In a vintage party dress
You are my target market
You're the only one I wanted to impress
I almost had it
A percentage of your interest
You are my target market (ah-ah)
You are my target market (ah-ah)
You are my target market (ah-ah)
