Strike up the band
Give yourselves a great big hand
And all together now
All together now, strike up the band
Bring down the house
Once more with feeling now
I'll try to make it count
It's all for you so take a bow

And everybody gave up
Until we start from the top again
Take it all from the top, the top, the top, the top

There's a hole in my soul
That can only be filled by you again
There's a hole in my soul
That can only be fixed by two

It can never be filled
Never be filled
Never be filled by anyone else but you
It can never be filled
Never be filled
Never be filled by anyone else but you
See Kaiser Chiefs LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like
Whip up the crowd
Get 'em going nice and loud
But you're the only one I see
You're the only one, it's you and me
Strike up the band
Give yourself a great big hand
And all together now
Stay together, hold onto my hand

And everybody gave up
Until we start from the top again
Take it all from the top, the top, the top, the top

There's a hole in my soul
That can only be filled by you again
There's a hole in my soul
That can only be fixed by two

It can never be filled
Never be filled
Never be filled by anyone else but you
It can never be filled
Never be filled
Never be filled by anyone else but you
You'll find each person in the world are the same
We're just the same
We're the same
Only different by name (The top, the top, the top)
We're the same
The top, the top, the top, the top

There's a hole in my soul
That can only be filled by you again
There's a hole in my soul
That can only be fixed by two
There's a hole in my soul
That can only be filled by you again
There's a hole in my soul
