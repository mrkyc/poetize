She were lying in the bathroom
I was banging on the door
She was crying in a puddle
On the laminate floor
I was screaming out "let me in
You've had too much gin
You better come out or I'm kicking it in"
The door unlocked, my heart stops
I throw-ow-ow, she says

Don't just stand, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, do something
Don't just stand, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, do something
Do something

The 24-hour garage
And it's in my hand
As a telephone it's average
But it's worth a grand
A gang of youths
Start throwing abuse
Your money or your Nikes, do I have to choose?
All pride lost, stood in my socks
I fro-o-oze and I thought...

Don't just stand, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, do something
Don't just stand, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, do something
Do something

It would be useful if you knew
That everything you say and do
Potentially could change tomorrow
And if you're all still sleeping there
Without the power without a care
Don't mention me when your alarm goes, yeah

Life is just a beer garden
A sunny afternoon
There's always one drunk hardman
Singing out of tune
A plastic chair flies through the air
The lager tops go everywhere
The jukebox clicks, the record sticks
And we fro-o-oze, everybody sang...

Don't just stand, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, do something
Don't just stand, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, do something
It would be useful if you knew
That everything you say and do
Potentially could change tomorrow
And if you're all still sleeping there
Without the power without a care
Don't mention me when your alarm goes
