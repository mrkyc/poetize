I never seen nobody ever live like you
We never leave the house without a drink or two
We never go to work, we play all night and day
I never thought a life could ever be that way

Although the lights fade, they never went out
The life that we made, will never wear out
And though the lights fade, they never went out
The life that we made, will never wear out

Why are you so sad, oh
If sex makes everything better, better?
Why are you so mad, oh
If sex makes everything better?

You've never seen the summers that you didn't like
I never been to paradise that wasn't right
But one in every hundred times I'd see right through
You maybe drop a line or times I miss my cue

Although the lights fade, they never went out
The life that we made, will never wear out
And though the lights fade, they never went out
The life that we made, will never wear out

Why are you so sad, oh
If sex makes everything better, better?
Why are you so mad, oh
If sex makes everything better?

We got separated during the aftermath
Now I'm following your path of destruction back
We had to leave because the people were asking us
Sit down because we're scaring the passengers
I've been exploring every avenue
Worn shoes out keeping up after you
Need help? Well the number to call is 0800 good clean fun
A little bit of good clean fun
We're living like a loaded gun
All we need is good clean fun, fun, yeah

Why are you so sad, oh
If sex makes everything better, better?
Why are you so mad, oh
If sex makes everything better?
Why are you so sad, oh
If sex makes everything better, better?
Why are you so mad, oh
