It was only just last Christmas
We decided we would try
To add another little puppy
To our family tonight
Making lists and we were laughing
Too much Bailey's over ice
I held the litmus and you miss it
And now we're checking daily twice, yeah

We can talk when we get home
(Golden oldie, golden oldie)
'Cause there are things I'd like to do before we're old
(Golden oldie, golden oldie)
When I get you on your own, alone
And if you wanted to then
I'll show you to my room and we can get into tune

(Golden oldie, golden oldie)
Woohoo, oh-oh
(Golden oldie, golden oldie)
Woohoo, oh yeah
(Golden oldie, golden oldie)
Woohoo, oh-oh
