Didn't know that we'd gotten this far, and now I'm ready to throw it
And we make believe there's nothing wrong with you
Why do you act surprised when you got it you show it
When you cry like that and you throw yourself down on the floor?

Hold me down, you're my dead end
I said show me my mistakes again
Made me laugh that time you throw me out
Thrown me out, why?

Because
Oh why do you do it to me?
Why do you always try to make me feel like a nobody?
Oh why do you do it to me?
Why do you always try to make me feel like a nobody?

Didn't know that I was part of the show and now it's finally over
And you don't think I can function without you
Why do you try and disguise it when everyone knows it
When you kick like that and I'm already down on the floor

Hold me down, you're my dead end
I said show me my mistakes again
Made me laugh that time you throw me out
Thrown me out, why?

Why do you always try to make me feel like a nobody?
Oh why do you do it to me?
