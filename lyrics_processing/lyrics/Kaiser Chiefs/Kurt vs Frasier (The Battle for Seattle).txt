What do you think
Of hitting the road?
Leave it behind
Lighten the load
Full of mistakes
Make a new start
Pull up a crate
And empty your heart

Cross out Christmas, cross out endless summers
Cross out high school dances, cross out all the one hit wonders
And we'll cross out kisses, cross out private numbers
Cross out teen romances, cross our hearts and hope to die again but

Never forget my name (hey!)
Never erase the days of Kurt Cobain and Frasier Crane
Never forget my name (hey!)
Letting it wash away with all last year's Seattle rain

What do you think?
How do you know
When it is real
And when it's a show?
Making the rent
And sending it home
Pack up the tent
Where shall we go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go
