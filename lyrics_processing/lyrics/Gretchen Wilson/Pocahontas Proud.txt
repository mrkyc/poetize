I was raised in Pocahontas, Illinois
Everybody thought of me as one of the boys
'Cause I'd run with a crowd that was tough
At fifteen
I was tending Big O's Bar
I'd sing 'til 2:00 AM for a half-full tip jar
Spent my youth singing truth
Paying dues

I'm the biggest thing
That ever came from my hometown
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 'em down
If it's the last thing I do
Before they lay me in the ground
You know I'm gonna make Pocahontas proud

I knocked on every door on Music Row
But they looked down at me
And said, "Girl, go back home
You ain't got what we need in this town."
But they couldn't whup the fighting side of me
You know where I come from
We don't give up easily
Overnight
Took all my life to be found
You might also likeI'm the biggest thing
That ever came from my hometown
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 'em down
If it's the last thing I do
Before they lay me in the ground
You know I'm gonna make Pocahontas proud

At twenty-seven
I had baby Grace
I was born again when I saw her sweet face
And I knew she was the greatest thing I'd ever do

I'm the biggest thing
That ever came from my hometown
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 'em down
If it's the last thing I do
Before they lay me in the ground
I'm the biggest thing
That ever came from my hometown
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 'em down
If it's the last thing I do
Before they lay me in the ground
You know I'm gonna make Pocahontas proud
I was raised in Pocahontas, Illinois
Pocahontas proud
You know I'm gonna make Pocahontas proud
