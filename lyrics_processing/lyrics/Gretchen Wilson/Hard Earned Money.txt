With a pond and a pole and a place to fish
And a shotgun
Ten bucks an hour and a sixty-hour week
Got a put a little back to put a pinch in your cheek
But it's a job, son
Be glad you got one
A lot of work for little pay
So, we ain't throwing it away
Spending that hard earned money
Feels something country
If you can't get a ticket 'cause the cheap seats sold
Parking lot party where the beer's as cold
And ooh, wow, perfect
And every dollar laid down is worth it
People all around, let me hear you shout
If you know what I'm talking about
Spending that hard earned money
Hard earned money
Two dollars worth of gas and we're ready to go
Fishtail swerving down a gravel road
For a quarter mile
You might also likeCut-off shorts in a swimming hole
Red watermelon that's ripe and cold
In the sunshine
Now, that's a good time
We all know that life ain't free
But we still get off pretty cheap
Spending that hard earned money
Feels something country
If you can't get a ticket 'cause the cheap seats sold
Your parking lot party where the beer's as cold
And it's ooh, wow, perfect
And every dollar laid down is worth it
People all around, let me hear you shout
If you know what I'm talking about, come on
It don't matter where you're from
You can still find a little fun
Spending that hard earned money
To feel something country
If you can't get a ticket 'cause the cheap seats sold
Your parking lot party where the beer's as cold
And it's ooh, wow, perfect
And every dollar laid down is worth it
People all around, let me hear you shout
If you know what I'm talking about
Spending that hard earned money
Hard earned money
We'll be spending that hard earned money
