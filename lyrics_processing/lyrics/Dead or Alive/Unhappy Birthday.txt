I believed, I believed, I believed, I believed in you
It's my night
And everything should be so fine
And you look your usual devine
You make my eyes burn
Everybody's here and they're rocking to the house
I should have nothing to worry about
It's my party, i can cry if I want to
It's me, girl, who all the wrong has been done to
You've blown out the candles on my cake
Something's wrong, you've been gone too long
Something's wrong, have you been getting it on?
Do you wanna spoil my birthday now?
Unhappy birthday
Unhappy birthday, baby!
Unhappy birthday
My party's been ruined
So stop what you're doing!
Well, you walked in
And everyone stood still to stare
And I saw the light in your hair
It told me "danger"
You might also likeSo how
How could you do what you've done?
For once I'm the innocent one
It's my party, I can cry if I want to
It's me, girl, who the crime has been done to
Someone left my cake out in the rain
Something's wrong, you've been gone too long
Something's wrong, have you been getting it on?
Do you wanna spoil my birthday now?
