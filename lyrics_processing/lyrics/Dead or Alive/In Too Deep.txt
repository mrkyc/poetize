I could offer you a thousand things
But with a lot of them, you wouldn't bother
I could buy you ten real diamond rings
But I'm sure that you would want another
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away

You have brought me a lot of things
But the main one that you've brought was trouble
You put your finger to the trigger and you shot my heart
Well, now I'm really gonna burst your bubble
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away

But I'm in too deep, there's no getting out of it
In too deep, no doubt about it
In too deep, there's no getting out of it
In too deep, no doubt about it

(Too deep)
(Too deep)
You might also like
I could call you a lot of things
I could say there'll never be another
Every time the situation feels like it is close
I've got to turn around and say don't bother
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away

But I'm in too deep, there's no getting out of it
In too deep, no doubt about it
In too deep, there's no getting out of it
In too deep, no doubt about it
In too deep (There's no getting out of it)
In too deep (No doubt about it)
In too deep (There's no getting out of it)
In too deep (No doubt about it)

I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away

I could offer you a thousand things
But with a lot of them, you wouldn't bother
I could buy you ten real diamond rings
But I'm sure that you would want another
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away
But I'm in too deep, there's no getting out of it
In too deep, no doubt about it
In too deep, there's no getting out of it
In too deep, no doubt about it

(In too deep) There's no getting out of it
(In too deep) No, no, no, but I'm
(In too deep) There's no way I'm gonna go now
(In too deep) No, no, no, no
(In too deep) There's no getting out of it
(In too deep) No, no, no
(In too deep) There's no getting out of it
(In too deep) Yeah, yeah
