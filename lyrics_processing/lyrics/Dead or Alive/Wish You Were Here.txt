You have what somebody else has to stay with
I simply cannot ignore you
Come over here, I'll do something for you
Girls won't, boys don't
You've got me, the devil 
I call you up
And all I can say is
How I wish you were here, here
Where I can see ya, see ya
Oh, I wish you were here, here
Where I can see ya, see ya
I should grow up
And learn that people are not toys, now
Forget it boy, forget it boy, I won't
I have got my finger in my ear
I block out what people are saying
Block out the noise, block out the noise, you won't
And all I can say is
How I wish you were here, here
Where I can see ya, see ya
Oh, I wish you were here, here
Where I can see ya, see ya
No one would know
You might also likeI should grow up
And learn that people are not toys, now
Forget it boy, forget it boy, I won't
I have got my finger in my ear
I block out what people are saying
Block out the noise, block out the noise, you won't
And all I can say is

Where I can see ya, see ya
