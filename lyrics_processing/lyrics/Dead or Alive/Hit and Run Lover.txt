I used to know
A daydream believer with a heart of gold
Don't try to ignore me
Cause everyone already knows
All the scandalish things we used to do
The time at the movies, in you daddy's room
They don't satisfy me, they seem to do something for you
Why am I surprised, you're a hit and run lover
Put the hammer to the wheel, baby run for cover
Gonna tell it to your friends, you're a two time mother
Tell me why am I surprised?
Why am I surprised?
I have secrets, you were keeping
I was looking, you were leaping
Look at my face, I'm not lacking yet
I got something for you that you'll never forget
And I know, you know, they know
That all the magic is mine
You got no money, well maybe a dime
The time has some fortune and the hours are mine
We're gonna make it, we've got what it takes
We're gonna make it, we've got what it takes
