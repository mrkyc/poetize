I really felt secure
Because I wanted to
Who is zoomin' who
But I really must explain
That I can't hide the pain
When you enjoy yourself
With someone else
But there's one thing
That you should know about me
That I can't stand the lies
That I can't take the infidelity
I know you've been seeing
A total stranger
(A total stranger)
All the love we built
Has been tumbled down
'Cause of a total stranger
A total stranger
I know (I know)
You've been seeing
A total stranger
(A total stranger)
Everything we had
Has been thrown away
'Cause of a total stranger
A total stranger
You might also likeWhat's good for you
Is good for me, too
And I've had enough
Of your lying
Enough is enough
I've taken to much
You've made your mistake
Now you're crying
You better beware
When I come to town
I'm gonna paint it so red
You'll think it's burning down
That's how I got my name
(How I got my name)
And some things never change
And so I'm going home
Into the party zone
But there's one thing
You've got to know about me
That I can't stand the lies
That I can't take the infidelity
And I know you've been seeing
A total stranger
(A total stranger)
All the love we built
Has been thrown away
'Cause of a total stranger
A total stranger
I know, I know
You've been seeing
A total stranger
A total stranger
Boom, boom
With a total stranger
A total stranger
What has been done
Should never have been
You were just headed for heartbreak
I won't pretend
That I'll be your friend
You pay for mistakes
Now I know your game
I know what must be done
I'm gonna fan the flame
You will remember my name
Oh baby, I know
You've been seeing
A total stranger
In the boom-boom room
With a total stranger
A total stranger
And all of the time
That you were out all night
Well, I already knew
It was me who's fooling you
And I know you've been seeing
A total stranger
(A total stranger)
All the love we built
Has been thrown away
'Cause of a total stranger
A total stranger
I know, I know
You've been seeing
A total stranger
(A total stranger)
Boom, boom
With a total stranger
A total stranger
I know what you've been doing
With a total stranger
(A total stranger)
Everything we had
Has been thrown away
But it was me who was fooling you
Now, baby, and I know
I'm gonna, I'm gonna fan that flame
Because I'm goin' home
To the party zone
I know, I know, I know, I know
You've been seeing
A total stranger
(A total stranger)
Everything we had
Has been thrown away
And so I'm goin' home
To the party zone
And that's how I got my name
(How I got my name)
I'm gonna fan that flame
(Gonna fan that flame)
I know your game
So I know what must be done
