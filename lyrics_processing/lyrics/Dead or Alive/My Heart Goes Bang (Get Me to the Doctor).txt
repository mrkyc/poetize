(Ba-ba-bang, bang, bang, bang)
(My, my heart)
(My, my heart)

The other night a close friend told me
Never let my heart fall into careless hands
I said, "Thanks, that's very nice, appreciate your good advice
But things don't always go the way that I planned"

Oh you, you, you take my heart and shake it up
You, you, you take my heart and break it up

Get me to the doctor
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang

(My, my heart)
(My, my heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang)

When I get in close to you
I do the things I never do, there's no depression
Doctor, put me to the test
I've heard your lovin' is the best
The heat is rising, oh, I need a session

Oh you, you, you take my heart and shake it up
You, you, you take my heart and break it up

Get me to the doctor
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang

Doctor, doctor, give me the cure
Doctor, doctor, give me the cure

Doctor, I'm consulting you
I wanna put myself into your careless hands
All I need's a lovin' dose, I feel much better when you're close
I really hope things go the way that I planned
Oh you, you, you take my heart and shake it up
You, you, you take my heart and break it up

Get me to the doctor
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang

When I get close to you (ah)
When I get close to you (ah)
When I get close to you (ah)
When I get close to you (ah)
When I get close to you (ah)
