And I'll never find a lover like you again
I hear a Four Tops record on the radio
And the words remind me, I miss you
Ah Ah Baby don't say goodbye
The word is out that we'll soon be parted
Out of sight isn't out of mind
So spare a thought for me
I guess you couldn't face
The heavy responsibility, of looking at my face
And knowing you could never lie to me
Bad dreams can come true
I woke up this morning and I knew I was losing you
Breaking hearts never make a noise
If they did it would be a sad sound
I'm not like the other boys
I refuse to stay here and be clowned around with
Your love cause pain
And if I had the chance, I'd do it all again
Ah Ah Baby don't say goodbye
The word is out that we'll soon be parted
Out of sight isn't out of mind
So spare a thought for me
Ah Ah Baby don't say goodbye
Please spare a thought for the broken hearted
My love baby, it blew your mind
Some things are meant to be
You were meant for me
You might also likeYour love caused pain
And if I had the chance, I'd take you back again
Black leather roses wrapped in chain
You gave romantically
A jacket studded with your name
These things I keep eternally
Bad dreams can come true
I woke up this morning and I knew I was losing you
Ah Ah Baby don't say goodbye...
I've been to New York, Paris, and the south of Spain
And I'll never find a lover like you again
I hear a Four Tops record on the radio
And the words remind me, I miss you
Your love caused pain
But if I had the chance, I'd do it all again
