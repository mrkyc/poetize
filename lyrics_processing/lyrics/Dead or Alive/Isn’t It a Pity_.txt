(I must admit we do get along, he's quite a man!
No saint of course, but you must have expected that before you married him
Maybe that was why you married him...)

I'm a kind of hybrid of a cartoon and a feature
Some have thought me lovely, others saw an ugly creature
Some have thought me right at times and others found me tired
And I couldn't count the times that my backside has been admired

Beauty is glitter in my eyes
I really wanted roses but you sent me custard pies

Isn't it a pity that I'm not the prettiest girl in the world, sometimes I feel when I
Kick up my heels in the sun
I'm the loveliest one
Isn't it a pity that I'm not the prettiest girl in the world? But sometimes I feel when I
Kick up my heels in the sun
I'm the loveliest one

I'm a kind of cross between a pupil and a teacher
Some have found me lovely, others saw an ugly creature
I have found my image has obscured all that I am
But who said you can't mix vinegar with jam?

Beauty is glitter in my eyes
I really wanted roses but you sent me custard pies

Isn't it a pity that I'm not the prettiest girl in the world? But sometimes I feel when I
Kick up my heels in the sun
I'm the loveliest one
Isn't it a pity that I'm not the prettiest girl in the world, sometimes I feel when I
Kick up my heels in the sun
I'm the loveliest one

Isn't it a pity (the London image makers...
Face is made for mirror breakage
You know their magazines
Can not affect my self esteem!)
Beauty...
