I couldn't get to sleep I wanted more things
So, I looked in your eyes 'cos they were staring
But baby you have gone and got me wrong
I'm in no danger
'Cos, I'm not into falling for a stranger
I couldn't love you, even if I tried to
But baby you have gone and got me wrong
It was your lucky day
You should be happy that I looked your way
It's just a game you'll remember my name
Wow, your life's gonna change
Love can be strange
Come to me at night time
'Cos when the sun goes down, you know that's my time
And anytime you're with me that's a nice time
But baby you have gone and got me wrong
Don't think you're a special one
I was looking for a night of fun
And you were right there, you had loves stuff to share
But don't think that I care, Na, Na- Na, Na
Don't think that I care

I, oh I, don't wanna be your boyfriend
I, oh I, don't wanna be your boyfriend
I got your attention
But what is on my mind, I got to mention
That everywhere we go people are saying
But baby you have gone and got me wrong
This is love on the run
Don't think You're the special one
Just have a good time
The pleasure's all mine
Don't tell me no more lies
Don't tell no lies
You got me wrong (times 4)
I, oh I, don't wanna be your boyfriend,(times 2)
This is your lucky day
You should be happy that I looked your way

Wow, your life's gonna change
