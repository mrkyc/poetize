You can't look me in the eye
Every new face
That they let in through the door
Might be added on to your score
You tell me that it is just physical
You cannot fight the way you feel
It gets so hard for me
To keep you to myself
You're mine, you're mine, you're mine
You're mine, you're mine
What are we waiting for
Tell me what are we waiting for
What are we waiting for
There's trouble on the dance floor
Someone else has taken what's mine
Someone else has captured
Your attention and time
And your sweetness is your weakness
Someone else has taken what's mine
I know what you're thinking'
By the look in your eye
Babe, your sweetness is your weakness

In another place and time
You're like honey
For the bees that fly around
Attractive to the ground
You've got to tell me what you feel for me
It could make me feel so real
I won't share what's mine
With anybody else
You're mine, you're mine, oh mine
Oh mine, oh mine, oh mine
What are we waiting for
Tell me what are we waiting for
What are we waiting for
There's trouble on the dance floor
Someone else has taken what's mine
Someone else has captured
Your attention and time
And your sweetness is your weakness
Someone else has taken what's mine
I know what you're thinking'
By the look in your eye
Babe, your sweetness is your weakness
Someone else has taken what's mine
Someone else has captured
Your attention and time
And your sweetness
It goes on and on and on and on
Oh...
Babe, your sweetness
It's grooving, it's grooving
And perfect and stupid for me
Your sweetness is your weakness
Just for the sex of it
S-E-X
(repeat 4 times)
Someone else has taken what's mine
Someone else has captured
Your attention and time
And your sweetness is your weakness
Someone else has taken what's mine
I know what you're thinking'
By the look in your eye
Babe, your sweetness is your weakness
Someone else has taken what's mine
Someone else has captured
Your attention and time
And your sweetness
It goes on and on and on and on
