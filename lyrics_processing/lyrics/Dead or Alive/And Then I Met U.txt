That I am not the sweetest boy in town
Somehow you've been fascinated
In our times
We'll have the ups and down
But we'll feel alive
Wondering what
My hopes and dreams had come to
I was looking round
For something to hold on to
And then I met you
Just when I needed your love
I met you, so glad I met you
Just when I needed you love
It might be wise
For you to run away
And hide your heart
But you might change
While I'm away from your arms
And I would surely die
Wondering what
My hopes and dreams had come to
I was looking round
For something to hold on to
You might also likeAnd then I met you
Just when I needed your love
I met you, so glad I met you
Just when I needed you love
I met you, I met you
I couldn't bear to lose you
Now that I have found you
I won't hear a bad thing
People say about you
I was getting used to
Being on my own when
Then I met you
Just when I needed your love
I met you, so glad I met you
Just when I needed you love
And my heart says
I would be better off
Without your love
But though I know
This is not the time to tell it
Right from my heart
Wondering what
My hopes and dreams had come to
I was looking round
For something to hold on to
I couldn't bear to lose you
Now that I have found you
I won't hear a bad thing
People say about you
I was getting used to
Being on my own
And oh then I met you
I was looking around and around
I met you, so glad I met you
Just when I needed your love
I met you, I met you
Hey, standing in the corner
I've been watching you
All my friends use a cute line
It seemed to work
Most every time on you
Oh I met you
My heart, it says
That I should run away
And hide, and hide
Maybe you should run away
And hide your heart
I was wondering
Where my hopes and dreams had gone to
There I was
With nothing to hold on to
Hey, standing in the corner
I've been watching you (I've been watching you)
I've been looking around and around
And around and I was wondering
And then I met you
