Magpie, magpie
I'm sitting here watching the world go by
I wonder do you ever question why
Oh crow, oh crow
I'm sitting here wondering what you know
You see more of the day than I could dream

And I do not know what to tell you
I do not know what to say to you
I do not know what will set you free

But it's a hard, hard fight
A hard, hard fight
And I'm turning this one in
I'm turning this one in
I won't turn back
I've seen the sign
I won't turn back
Not for anyone
I've seen the sign and I know what is mine

What a lie, what a lie, what a lie
What a lie, what a lie looks like
Yeah, what a lie, what a lie, what a lie
What a lie, what a lie looks like
You might also like
Bluejay, bluejay
I don't think you mean quite what you say
I don't think you're the friend you claim to be
Oh crow, oh crow
Will you tell me please, tell me please what you know
You have seen more of the world than I could dream

I do not know what to tell you
I do not know what to say to you
I do not know what will set you free

But it's a hard, hard fight
A hard, hard fight
And I'm turning this one in
I'm turning this one in
And I won't turn back
I've seen the sign
I won't turn back
Not for anyone
I've seen the sign and I know why I'm free

What a lie, what a lie, what a lie
What a lie, what a lie looks like
What a lie, what a lie, what a lie
What a lie, what a lie looks like
Silence me and I won't be here anymore
Silence me and I won't be here anymore
You silence me and I won't be here anymore
Silence me and I won't be here anymore

What a lie, what a lie, what a lie, what a lie, what a lie
What a lie, what a lie, what a lie, what a lie, what a lie
What a lie, what a lie, what a lie, what a lie, what a lie
