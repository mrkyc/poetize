You lay on your back under spider-spun trees
Hallucinated on fractals of green
And thought about living with nothing to lose
With windows to see them before they see you

And you do not know how to pretend
You hoped it would all go away in the end
But you're every person in your dream
When anything happens, it happens to you, and you

You start believing in magic

What in the world are we gonna do now?
There's nowhere to turn and there's no one around
I suppose, in the end, well, that is what it is
You grow up alone and that's what you get left

But nobody knows how to forgive
You thought it might all go away if you did
Now you're every person in your dream
When anything happens, it happens for real, and you
You might also like
(Who do you cry to?)
You start believing in magic
(Who do you cry to?)


We lay on our back under vibrating green
Hallucinated on what it all means
Now, I could be patient, but just tell me how long
And why I feel like shit for what I didn't do wrong
'Cause I do not know how to pretend
I thought it would all go away in the end
But I'm every person in this dream
But when anything happens, it doesn't just happen to me

(Who do you cry to?)
You start believing in magic
(Who do you cry to?)
Well, I'm believing in magic
(Who do you cry to?)
Without believing in magic
(Who do you cry to?)
Turning like a stone
In the hand of the unknown
I made an art, oh
Out of believing in magic
But I made-believe
I could take it for granted
Falling like a star
I fell into your arms
Fell into your arms
It just happened by magic
It just happened by magic
