Nothing seems to be going my way
Trying to keep my sanity
It's getting the best of me
Today
Yesterday
Yes
I know the one
Who said I'd be safe from all harm
Just sometimes what I see
I let it get the best of me
Like today
Yesterday
Today Oh Today
Nothing seems to be going my way
Trying to keep my sanity
It's getting the best of me
Today
Yesterday
Yes I know the one
Who said I'd be safe from all harm
Just sometimes what I see
I let it get the best of me
Like today
Yesterday
My babies daddy's acting like a nut
My car is smoking
It keeps acting up
I feel like I'm about to lose my head
My strength is getting weak yall
My boss is acting like he is crack
Want me two shift back to back
Don't want to say something I'll regret
So I'll censor what I say
Today, Oh Today
Nothing seems to be going my way
Trying to keep my sanity
It's getting the best of me
Today
Yesterday
Yes
I know the one
Who said I'd be safe from all harm
Just sometimes what I see
I let it get the best of me
Like today
Yesterday
Been wait on a check about three weeks
The mortgage company is call as we speak
I feel like I'm about to lose my mind
My strength is getting yall
The IRS wants more than what I can give
If I give them what they want
How will I live
Instead of working for myself
I work for them
I'm trying to stay positive
Today, Oh Today
Nothing seems to be going my way
Trying to keep my sanity
It's getting the best of me
Today
Yesterday
Yes
I know the one
Who said I'd be safe from all harm
Just sometimes what I see
I let it get the best of me
Like today
