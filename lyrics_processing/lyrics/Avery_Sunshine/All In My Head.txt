I just wasn't in a place
Where I could hear what you meant
When you said it
I took it out of context and
Got all bent outta shape
So angry till I started thinking 'bout the sense
That it didn't make
It was all in my head
All the things that you said
I changed them around in my head
I listened not to my heart but to my mind instead
Sensitive and warm
That's the way I am, that's the way I was born
You know, doubts and insecurities
Make it hard for me to hear the things I should
I took it out of context and
Got all bent outta shape
So angry till I started thinking 'bout the sense
That it didn't make
It was all in my head
All the things that you said
I changed them around in my head
I listened not to my heart but to my mind instead
Made something out of something
I made a mountain out of a molehill
It's so sad that all the baggage I had made me feel
Things that weren't real
It was all in my head
All the things that you said
I changed them around in my head
I listened not to my heart but to my mind instead
It was all in my head
It was all in my head
I made it all up in my mind
It was all in my head, hold on, hold on
It was all in my head, It was all in my head
I need to get my mind, I was somewhere else, it was all in my head
It was all in my head, oh yeah, yeah
It was all in my head, all in my head
It was all in my head, all in my head
