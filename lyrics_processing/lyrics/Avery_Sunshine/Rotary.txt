Uh, yeah, yeah
Ayy, uh, yeah

My numbers stretch like the phone that is rotary
This is just debts that I know they gonna owe to me
I be so high, why bitches can't get over me
Drone to the neck, but it don't got a hold of me

Don't miss the old me
Turn down your shutter, bitch, you'll over-expose me
I'm DLP Official, no, I don't need a notary
Like the fame, I go straight up, ain't nobody holdin' me
Holdin' me, holdin' me
Back, my dog bark and then attack
I just sit back and I laugh
Feel like Johnny with my Cash
I'm like, "Hold up, wait a minute, ayo, Tommy, where's the stash?"
She got white on her lips, but it ain't a milk mustache, bitch
Bitch, I'm a Lorax, I speak to the tree
Only got gas, make you weak in the knees
I feel so blessed that I feel like a sneeze
Leave you a mess and your blood in the streets
Meanwhile,  something you'll never see
I'm turnin' up and I'm drinkin' that Hennessy
You not with us and that makes you an enemy
You really tough, but it looks like pretend to me
Yeah, yeah, these racks pullin' down my pants like a fuckin' dancer
I'ma kill that pussy, I'ma put it in a damn hearse
Now she makin' weird noises like a fucking Chance verse
We ain't even fuck but by my dick she was enamored
You might also like
My numbers stretch like the phone that is rotary
This is just debts that I know they gonna owe to me
I be so high, why bitches can't get over me
Drone to the neck, but it don't got a hold of me

Fuck a bitch, love a bitch, you the same as the other bitch
Tunnel bitch, vision shit, disjoint, dispoint
His coin haunts him like Congress goin' insane
Whippin' in Impalas but ain't shit tame
It ain't shit changed
Sunny side shinin', wrist ain't poppin'
Blockin' up my mental state
Put your girl in a pretzel shape
Don't like this game but I must obey
'Til I pop out in a foreign, doors go Spalding gray
So much trauma in my head feel like Chris Benoit
Head butt off the top to all you fake boy fuck facades
Felt a little tense, now the rust is off
Your frontin' off your funds, now my trust is gone
Waiting for your sixteen back, bitch, come on
Only got 'til 4:30 and then I'll fuck your moms
My gevity long, you ahead of me long
Rather die than be pawned
I shined, y'all are my sons, oh, my God
My numbers stretch like the phone that is rotary
This is just debts that I know they gonna owe to me
I be so high, why bitches can't get over me
Drone to the neck, but it don't got a hold of me
My numbers stretch like the phone that is rotary
This is just debts that I know they gonna owe to me
I be so high, why bitches can't get over me
