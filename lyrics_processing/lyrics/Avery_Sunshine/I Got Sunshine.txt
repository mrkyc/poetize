And I've got myself to thank
I had to make ten dollars last for three weeks and a day
All of my bills are due
And so I don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta keep it moving 'till I get to my breakthrough
I see a brighter day in view
Sometimes I miss it for the hell I'm going through
Ain't nothing gonna keep me blue
Listen 'cause I know I got
I got sunshine on my mind
I got sunshine all the time
I got sunshine everywhere I'm going I want you to know
I got sunshine when it hurts
And when nothing seems to work
I got sunshine
Do you see the sun shine
If you're working every day
Two jobs for getting no pay
I know it's hard to see the light with darkness in your way
But listen let me tell you
What you outta do
Open up your mind and know the sunshine is in you
You might also likeI see a brighter day in view
Don't you miss it for the hell you're going through
Ain't nothing gonna keep me blue
Listen 'cause I know I got
I got sunshine on my mind
I got sunshine all the time
I got sunshine everywhere I'm going I want you to know
I got sunshine when it hurts
And when nothing seems to work
I got sunshine
Do you see the sun shine
I got sunshine on my mind
I got sunshine all the time
I got sunshine everywhere I'm going I want you to know
I got sunshine when it hurts
And when nothing seems to work

Do you see the sun shine
I got sunshine on my mind
I got sunshine all the time
I got sunshine in my purse
I got sunshine in my shoes
I got sunshine everywhere
I got sunshine in my hair
