Good Afternoon
Been waiting to say that all day
Good Afternoon
Been waiting see your face
Close the door
Make love to me
We don't have much time
Good Afternoon
I'm so glad your here
So glad that you could get away

Cause there's just not time enough in the morning
And we're both worn out by the evening
Sometimes it's nothing better than the sweet, sweet afternoon
Hey

Good good good afternoon
I love you
Been dreaming bout you baby
And I've been missing you
I'm so glad you could make it through

Cause there just not time enough in the morning
And we're both worn out by the evening
Sometimes there's nothing better than a sweet sweet afternoon

All that's on my mind
