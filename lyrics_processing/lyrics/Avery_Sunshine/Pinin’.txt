Telling myself how it was going to end
It's been such a long time and I have got butterflies
Nervous that you will know all my thoughts
So much more that you ought
Please understand that I know we both have our ties
What happened how did we miss out
I just didn't realize what you meant to me until now
Still wondering how it could have turned out
But I guess we'll never know and I can't
Can't get you out of my head
Can't get you out of my system
Still wanting you
I don't care who knows it
Twenty long years have passed
And I'm still pinin baby
Yes I am
Had you given this this much thought at all
Like what would happen if we started to fall
In love like we did when we were to young to even know
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
I would have loved you like I was out of my mind
If only I knew then what I know now I'd be fine
What happened how did we miss out
I wish I could move on but I can't
I'm perplexed, bewildered, upset
Cause I can't have you
No No No and I can't get you
Can't get you out of my head
Can't get you out of my system
Still wanting you
I don't care who knows it
Twenty long years have passed
And I'm still pinin baby
Still sitting over in a corner wishing you were mine
Oh yeah
Can't get you out of my head
Can't get you out of my system
Still wanting you
I don't care who knows it
Twenty long years have passed
And I'm still pinin baby
And I'm still pinin baby
And I'm still pinin baby
Somebody say pinin (pinin)
Pinin (pinin)
