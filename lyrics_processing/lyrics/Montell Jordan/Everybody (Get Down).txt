And if I'm not mistaken, this is an invitation
To participate with me, she and she

She was sitting in a chair
With her legs lightly spread
Showing just how off the chain she is, yeah

(And what she's showing to me)
You could call it "Basic Instinct"
(I played it oh so pimply)
I told her when and where to meet me
See, playboy ain't that anxious
So I just let honey know
I'ma twist her back up later
But right now I gots to flow, flow, flow

A party ain't a party (Unless)
Unless you've got a shorty
Moving and shaking that ass on you
