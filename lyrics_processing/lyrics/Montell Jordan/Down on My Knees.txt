Say you like it (Oh)
I wanna hear you (Baby, baby, baby)
Louder (Oh, say you like it)
Tell me how you like it (Say you like it) 'Cause tonight, you're getting it all, baby
Tell me you like it (Tell me you like it)
Oh girl, you want it, lady (Oh girl, you want it, lady)
Oh, do you want it?
Then let me up on it
Do you like it? (Do you like it?)
Is it good to you?
Oh, oh, no, no

You say you've got a man, but he ain't home, huh
It's getting late in the evening, and he leaves you all alone
I can see that you're tempted, oh girl, to do somethin' wrong
And with my song playing on the radio, now you wanna get it on
Girl, let me take off your stockings
I'll pull 'em down, pull 'em down real slow
Your body needs my attention
From your head to your baby toes
I know you're scared, I see you shaking
Your thighs are just aching for a good tongue spanking
A towel you need to get
'Cause it's all slippery when it's wet
You might also like
'Cause I'm going down
(I'll go down on my knees)
Whoa, I'm going down and do the things that you want me to
All the things that your man won't do, I'll do 'em
(I'll go down on my knees for you)
Said I'm going down, going down, down
You know that I will do anything for you

So many ways we can do it
On your knees, on the floor, in the shower
And I won't stop 'til every drop's
Got you wanting me hour after hour
I'll taste your lips so let me kiss you around
'Til the kitty starts to give me that sweet, sweet sound
You've got a freak on your hands
You know that Montell demands to go down

(I'll go down on my knees)
Oh, do the things that you want me too
All the things that your man won't do, I'll do 'em, I'll do 'em
(I'll go down on my knees for you)
Said, I'm going down, going down
And I'll do all you want me to, oh baby, yeah
(I'll go down on my knees)
I'll make you weak in the knees
And I'll do the things that you want me to
And all the things your man won't do, said I'll do
(I'll go down on my knees for you)
Said, I'm going down
Oh, baby, are you ready? I'm going down
(I'll go)
When your man ain't taking care of business, I'll go
(I'll go)
Don't you know I'm the one to keep you satisfied?
(Do the things you want me to)
I'll do what you want me to
(All the things that your man won't do)
All the things that your man won't do
(I'll go)
Oh, I'll, I'll go, baby

(I'll go down on my knees)
I said, I'll go, baby
I'm trying to satisfy ya
Girl, I know that you really like it, do you like it, baby?
(I'll go down on my knees for you)
Oh, I wanna satisfy you, one hundred percent, baby
I'm gonna give you my all, starting tonight, baby
(I'll go down on my knees, I'll go)
Oh, it'll be right, baby, oh
(Do the things that you want me to)
Turn out the lights, baby
(All the things that your man won't do)
Oh, he ain't coming home
(I'll go down on my knees, I'll go)
And that means we can take our time
(Do the things that you want me to)
Oh, that's what I plan to do tonight, take my time
(All the things that your man won't do)
Going down
(I'll go down on my knees, I'll go)
Baby, I'm going now, oh
(Do the things that you want me to)
It'll feel so right
(Do the things that you want me to)
Everything you want me to
(All the things that your man won't do)
I'm going down on you
(I'll go down on my knees, oh yeah)
Oh, said, I'm going down, down, down, baby
(Do the things that you want me to)
Oh
(All the things that your man won't do)
All the things that your man won't do
(I'll go down on my knees, I'll go)
You know that I'll do it for you, oh baby
(Do the things that you want me to)
