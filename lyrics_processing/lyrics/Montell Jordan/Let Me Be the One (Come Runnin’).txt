Be the one you come running
Be the one you come running to

Don't cry lady, dry your eyes
You know I wanna be the one
To make you feel alright
If you will let me do what I wanna do
Then I will be the one
The one that you come running to

Now wasn't I that special guy
That you could rely on
A shoulder to cry on
If you would give me the opportunity
I'll show you what I'll do
I'll be the one that you come running to

Let me be the one you come running to (I wanna be)
Be the one you come running (Only one)
Be the one you come running to (That you come running to)
Let me be the one you come running to (Won't you let me be)
Be the one you come running
Be the one you come running to (Come running)
