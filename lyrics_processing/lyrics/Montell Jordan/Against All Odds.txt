Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, you
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I could do is watch you leave
Girl, we shared the laughter and the pain
We even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
Take a look at me now
There is just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just a memory of your face
Take a look at me now
There is just an empty space
And your coming back to me is against the odds
That's a chance I've gotta take
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
You might also likeTake a look at me now
There is just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just a memory of your face
Take a look at me now
There is just an empty space
And girl, just to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face
Take a look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
Your coming back to me is against the odds
That's a chance I gotta take
Take a look at me now
(Coming back to me) is against all odds
But the chance I've gotta take
Look at me now, now, now, now, now
I'm so sad, sad, sad, sad, sad
Look at me now, now, now, now, now
Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad
Look at me now, now, now, now, now
No, no, no, no, no
