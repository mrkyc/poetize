Uh, yeah, comin' right back at cha
With a different type of swing, ya know
(Somethin' for the honeys) You better ask somebody
(Somethin' for the honeys)
Baby, this is for you, and you, and definitely you

I'm the type of guy who takes time to just kick back
I turn around my baseball cap
I have a 40 sittin' on my lap
Slamming the ivories until I sees
A female worth my while
I'm scoping that ass, checking her smile
And I know that I can get it
And I'll hit it if she's wit' it
I get the five to the six, seven digits
Call her up on my cellular
And all the shit that I'll say to her
The fun will begin when I hit the skizins (Yeah)
So if a girlie is lonesome
I think that she knows where to go when she wants some
'Cause Monty ain't here for nothing, but I got a little

Somethin' for the honeys
(Yeah, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys
(You know, the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Uh-huh, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys

Ooh, summertime, no funner time for me to kick it with you
To find something or someone to get into
I call up my crew, I tell them to bring a brew
And some Hennessy for the beach party
So call up your girlfriends
And you know there always tends to be an ugly one
But bring her, too
Fat or skinny, she likes to shoop (Shoop, shoop)
With Montell in the SL Coupe
While the beat is bumpin'
From South Central to Compton, a little somethin' somethin'
Could very well be the next Aaron Neville
Sounding like nobody 'cause I'm on another level
And you fellas can't dig it with a shovel
But it ain't for you

Somethin' for the honeys
(Yeah, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Somethin' for the honeys
(Yeah) Ah, suki, suki now, honey
(Yeah, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
Yeah, somethin' for the honeys

This is something for the honey, yeah
(Sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)
When you're rollin'
Summertime, oh so fine
It feels alright
Summertime tonight
Something for you, honey, oh
The M-O the N-T the E double L and
And yes I'm guaranteeing that I won't be failin'
Some people call me Monty, some call me Monty Swinga
Sometimes I bust a rhyme but I'm an R&B singer
And I'ma go on and flow on
And you tell two friends and she'll tell two
And so on and so on
Another number one hit so get your roll on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
