Yeah, yeah
When I'm around you
Haha, this still happens every time
When I'm around you
Oh, oh
When I'm around you

I've been waiting for the perfect opportunity to talk to you and say
I be getting funny feelings, girl
Even through we're together, I still lose my cool and then my words get in the way, oh

When I'm around you
I be stumbling over my feet, yeah
When I'm around you
My heart just skips a beat, yeah
When I'm around you
And I be mumbling over my words
When I'm around you
Oh
When I'm around you
I go crazy, crazy when I'm
When I'm around you

Gotta get this game plan tight
Gotta make my next move right (Next move right)
Gotta do what I gotta do
I'm so into you
You got me hoping right now (Girl)
I seem cool, but inside I'm shaking (Shaking, shaking)
I'm talking every little step I'm taking
You're fine, and we're fine
But in my mind
Baby, I swear I refuse
To get comfortable and lose
The thing that made us fall in love (Love)
I think of the first time we met
Girl, I'll never forget what I felt

When I'm around you
I be stumbling over my feet, yeah
When I'm around you
My heart just skips a beat
When I'm around you
I be mumbling over my words
When I'm around you
Oh, ah
When I'm around you
I go crazy, crazy when I'm around you
When I'm around you
Yeah, okay
One, then comes the two to the three to the four
When I'm 'round you, girl, I only want more
What we got is timeless (Timeless)
I'll put you on a plane and fly you the islands (Yeah)
I'm like
Ayy, who got my heart for forever? It's you
Who held me down, made me better? It's you
Was slippin' and my eyes had me trippin'
I was livin' like I didn't recognize it's a privilege, but true
Love is hard to find in this day and time
People lyin', don't nobody wanna be tied down
But you got me on the roads for it
It's a wrap, so you know I prolly rode for it, yeah
I'm old school like Gazelles with the fat laces
I still believe in chivalry, it's that basic
I open up the door of my heart
Let you in while my man Montell sing his part like

When I'm around you
I be stumbling over my feet, yeah
When I'm around you
My heart just skips a beat, yeah
When I'm around you
I be mumbling over my words, yeah
When I'm around you
Hey! When I'm around you
I go crazy, crazy when I'm around you
When I'm around you
I stumble, fall over my feet
When I'm around you
My heart just skips a beat
When I'm around you
I mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mu-mumble all over my words
When I'm around you
Hey!
When I'm around you
I go crazy, crazy when I'm around you
When I'm around you

When I'm around you
When I'm around you
When I'm around you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I'm around you
When I'm around you, babe (Around you, babe)
Oh (Oh)
I love you, babe (I love you, babe)
I love you (I love you)
I love you, babe (I love you, babe)
