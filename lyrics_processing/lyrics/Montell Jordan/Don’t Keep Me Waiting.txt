So what's up? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah (I'm waiting, baby)
Oh, oh, oh

Baby, you're a good thing
And good things come to those who wait
And girl I'm next in line, all night
I've been patiently waiting for your call
So girl, stop wasting time
Oh
You see that clock that's on your wall?
It's tick-tock-telling you
To give Monty Swing your all, oh yeah (Yeah)
So if you've been holding out (Yeah)
I think you'd better hurry (I'm waiting, baby)
'Cause your time is running out (Running out)
And baby, don't you worry, no, no, no, no
