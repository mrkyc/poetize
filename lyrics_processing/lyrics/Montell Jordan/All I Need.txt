All I need

If you just say the words
That I can make you feel alright
I promise that I'll love you
Every morning, afternoon and night
Something about you got me crazy
Going out my mind
I can't believe what's happening
I need to love you all the time

I'll take your hand ("You bad")
Pull you close ("You bad")
Rock you in my arms ("You bad")
Be the one who loves you most ("You bad")
Oh, take your time ("You bad")
I'll take you there ("You bad")
Anywhere you wanna go ("You bad")
But there's one thing you should know

You're all I want, you're all I need
My heart and soul, my everything
You're all I want, you're all, you're all I need
Na-na, na-na, na-now
You might also like
Now that you're here with me
The table's set, I'm so direct
As we begin to enter into satisfying fantasies
I hit the spot, you move like that
You're on the top, I'm on my back
We're rolling over and it's just like in my dreams

I'll take you there ("You bad")
Pull you close ("You bad")
Rock you in my arms ("You bad")
Be the one who loves you most ("You bad")
Oh, take your time ("You bad")
I'll take you there ("You bad")
Anywhere you wanna go ("You bad")
But there's one thing you should know

You're all I want, you're all I need
My heart and soul, my everything (My everything)
You're all I want, you're all, you're all I need
(You're all I need, baby, yes, you are)
You're all I want, you're all I need
My heart and soul, my everything (My everything)
You're all I want, you're all, you're all I need
(Yes, you are, sugar, you're all I need)
You're all I want, you're all I need
My heart and soul, my everything
You're all I want, you're all, you're all I need
(All I need, you're so incredible)
You're all I want, you're all I need (All I need)
My heart and soul, my everything (My everything)
You're all I want, you're all, you're all I need
(Everything I want and so much more)
You're all I want, you're all I need
My heart and soul, my everything
You're all I want, you're all, you're all I need
