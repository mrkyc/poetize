Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Do ya like it, like it, like it, like it, girl?

Great, I'm in trouble, I suppose because I does hit
Girlfriend jalopy in my drop-top Rolls
Traffic came to a halt
I'm like "I beg your pardon, madam, it was truly my fault"
And instead of me yellin' and actin' all bugged
Hon all in my drop-dead gorgeous mug
Pretty, body definitely curvy, and thirdly
The way she dyed her hair bronze fitted her superbly
Baby, let me say what's on my mind
Take a little time to express myself, honey, I think you're fly
Now I don't have no problem sayin' what I like
I'd like to spend some time with you startin' with tonight, and I like

I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooh, I can't help myself
Baby, I like
I'd like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooh, I can't help myself
Baby, I like
You might also like
Here's the situation, I'll lay it on the line
Meaningless relationships be wastin' all my time
You are the special someone that I wanna get to know
Baby, can't you see it in my eyes? I wanna take you home

Tonight, let's take our time
Do it nice, do it slow, baby, we got nowhere to go
Oh, I hope you don't mind
Oh, I'm comin' on real strong, I give good lovin' all night long, oh, I like

And when you move your hips (Can I kiss your lips?)
