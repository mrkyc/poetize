Me a think and wonder but me can't understand
What the drink it a do for we Indian man
Me a think and wonder but me can't understand
What the drink it a do for we Indian man
(Verse 1)
Now when me talk this ya no bother worry nor fret
No bother feel say Apache come fe disrespect
But nough mon them a drink and them can't give a damn
Bout the children that a cry and about them woman
And the money that a pass mon from hand to hand
And the job where them have where them have fe work long
So if you have the answer mon would you tell me
Why them can't lef the drink till them get sharbee
(Chorus)
Mai sorch thar sorch thar sumugde nay logthee
Why them drink too much and get sharbee
Mai sorch thar sorch thar sumugde nay logthee
Why them drink too much and get sharbee
(Verse 2)
Nough mon them a work till all a 7:30
But no wan rush home wan to see the family
Them wan 2 pint and 2 glassee
Then kar pornch-gair and the wife angry
Ca all day she a cook mon make the subjee
And them him start say roti - nay chythee
Just wan more sharb mon fe me belly
Then you have the same mon go to a Indian wedding
And if there is no sharb then a pure talking
That it is disrespect and it is an insult
To have no whisky just juice and coke
Sare-jarne notch-thai but him only wan talk
Sadar time waste hor-gear ca there is no sharb
And then him talk bout the wedding that him love
But o-pie kenthar said him gone to the pub
You might also like(Chorus)
Mai sorch thar sorch thar sumugde nay logthee
Why them drink too much and get sharbee
Mai sorch thar sorch thar sumugde nay logthee
Why them drink too much and get sharbee
(Verse 3)
O whisky nall bacardi them a start drinking
Fai-ken-there gudee mai chlarenee and a start driving
Usee thawnoo thusi-air "O thusee gudee nai chlow"
Uchee bolar kair kenthere "O mai bair shadthow"
Unoo swearair thus yeh fer meri gol mon gair
Rathnoo yar-iae thuva thuv not gair
And me feel so strong when me see what me see
When the drink come bout break up the family
But even so the wifes put up with the drinking
Ca divorce in a we culture is not a popular thing
So respect to the woman fight fe all of we
Ca the family would a split if it wasn't for she
(Chorus)
Me a think and wonder but me can't understand
What the drink it a do for we Indian man
Me a think and wonder but me can't understand
What the drink it a do for we Indian man
(Verse 4)
Now me done talk this ya one but don't get me wrong
Indian mon them is good so please understand
Its only when them start drink them have a next side
Come like when you watch mon Jekle and Hyde
But now the reason of concern why me feel the anga
Ca the kids them a follow but a start younger
(Chorus)
Mai sorch thar sorch thar sumugde nay logthee
Why them drink too much and get sharbee
Mai sorch thar sorch thar sumugde nay logthee
Why them drink too much and get sharbee
Me a think and wonder but me can't understand
What the drink it a do for we Indian man
Me a think and wonder but me can't understand
What the drink it a do for we Indian man
