This is a warning fe each and everyone
You have fe no bout the AIDS upon the island
This is a warning fe all the youth them
Listen raggamuffin Indian a tell them
Say you listen when me talk original Arawak
Say the AIDS it a gwarn and we have fe stop that
Hear them talk bout the coke
Hear them talk bout the crack
Talk bout heroin cha! we no wan that
When me chat fe the Indian, white and the black
But you listen when me come and start fe attack
All the idiot them that love fe be slack
Say them have fe wipe out mon off this ya map
Ca the AIDS it gwarn and me wan none of that
