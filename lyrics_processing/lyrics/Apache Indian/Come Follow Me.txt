See the Taj Mahal one of the seven wonder
The golden temple a Amritsar

The Hindus bath in-a the Ganges river
In-a Bombay city you find the film star
The nicest place are the one Kashmir

Say the Sikh them a fight fe Kalistania
In-a pind and city nough people suffer

And if you pass one place where them call Calcutta
