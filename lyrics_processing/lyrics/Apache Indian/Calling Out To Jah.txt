I know a place where we can go - and I know a place to be free
And I know a place where we can go - lets unite and live in love and intiy
Calling out to jah - calling out to the highest father
Calling out to jah - to mek every man come live together
Verse (luciano)
In this world of uncertainty
All we've got is you and me
There's no need for hostility
Lets unite and live in love and intiy
Say brothers and sisters
No matter what denomination
No matter the class or the creed
And no matter your nation
It's one God one aim one destiny
One universe oh can't you see
Come along lets unite
Lets unite and live in love and intiy
