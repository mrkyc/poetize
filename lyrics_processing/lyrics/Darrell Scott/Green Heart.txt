I met her years ago one summer
She was working at a church camp up the Boulder River
It was the first time I felt that aching wonder
It was the first time I felt I want to quiver
I went home for summer football
She went back to Fallon County
She was the only thing I thought about
Every minute every day
I tried to write her letters
I tried to keep her near me
But every time she wrote back
She was was farther away

I played my last game in a loss against White Sulphur
I went home that night
And I got ready for a ride
Packed some clothes and some blankets in a thirty gallon garbage bag
Was out before the daylight
With the barn door open wide

From Stanford down through Harlow
Past Baker to the North Dakota line
I rode my sorrel gelding
And I'll follow this green heart of mine
You might also like
Big ponderosas the sweetness of the cottonwoods
Beauty of a sunrise over miles and miles of sage
Antelope and mule deer, white tail, and a touch of fear
A sea of prairie grasses
And a thousand birds of prey

Found pasture for my horse just out of Baker
Took a room there for the night
Washed some clothes, shaved my face
I bought some roses at a florist there next morning
Asked for directions and I rode out to her place

I found her house and tied my pony to a tree
Ran fingers through my hair
As I walked to the door
There she stood, I could see it wasn't good
She gave a nervous laugh
Said, "what did you come here for?"

From Stanford down through Harlow
Past Baker to the North Dakota line
I rode my sorrel gelding
And I'll follow this green heart of mine
Stopped at a ranch on Powder River
I'd spend the night there on my way through
I called my father
Said "bring the horse trailer
I wish to God I'd listened to you"

Nineteen days across Montana
There was frost on every morning in that damn November wind
All of my life to do without her
