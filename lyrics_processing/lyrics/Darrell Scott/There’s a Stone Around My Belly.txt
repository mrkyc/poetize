There's a stone around my belly
Keeps me up at night
Makes me want to feed it
Makes me want to fight with the world
I got a heart full of darkness
I got a headache full of dreams
I got a lifetime of memories
I don't know what they mean to this world
Is there a place in this world for a dreamer
If dreaming were all he could bring
Would you listen to a man with a stone around his belly sing?

Now Jesus was a carpenter
This I do believe
He built his church without walls
And we brought him to his knees in this world
Now we lift our prayers to heaven
Up above the smog
Up above the satellites
Angels long for this world
Is there a place in this world for angels
Who would turn in their perfect wings
Just to walk down this road lifetime and sing
A song for this world
You might also likeHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

There's a reason for the sadness
There's a reason for the song
I have reason to believe that I won't be too long for this world
Sixty years seventy-three if I'm lucky
Take this stone take this belly to a cabin in Kentucky
Push the stone up the mountain
Watch the stone roll down
Roll the stone into a pick-up truck
And drive it into town
In the town I check my mailbox
Find a letter from a friend
Who has hired a private eye
To find out where the hell I've been
Well I've been up on the mountain
I've been rollin' like a stone
Searchin' this whole world over
For a place to be alone
Alone to see the sunsets
And to count what I have lost
Alone to read aloud Walt Whitman
