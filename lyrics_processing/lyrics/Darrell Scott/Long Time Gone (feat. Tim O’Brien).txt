Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley tbacca
Now he knows it never will
My brothers found work in indiana
M sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me Ive been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I dont know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again
Deliah plays that ol church piana
Sitting out on her daddys farm
She always thought that wed be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin
And lord, Ive been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I dont know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin back again

Now me, I went to nashville
Tryin to beat the big deal
Playin down on broadway
Gettin there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah Im gonna be a star
Now, me and deliah singing every sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear whats cookin
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they dont sound haggard
Theyve got money but they dont have cash
They got junior but they dont have hank
I think, I think, I think
The rest is a long time gone
No, I ain't hit the roof since I dont know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back
I said a long time gone
No, I ain't honked the horn since I dont know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again
I said a long time, long time, long time gone
Well its been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh, its been a long time gone
Long time, long time, long time gone
