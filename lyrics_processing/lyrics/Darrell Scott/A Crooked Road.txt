To get where I am going I must walk a crooked road
And only when I'm looking back I see the straight and narrow
I see the straight and narrow when I walk a crooked road
I sing a lonesome song to anyone who'll listen
To anyone who'll listen I 'll sing my lonesome song
And when I hear you singing too, the sorrow sounds so hopeful
The sorrow sounds so hopeful when I sing my lonesome song
And a lonesome song will be my true companion
When all else has abandoned for singing of their own
And a lonesome song will fill my days with gladness
Make joy out of sadness when I sing this lonesome song to you
I love with all my heart, there is no way of stopping
I have no way of stopping I just love with all my heart
Through the broken and the beautiful, the bad news and the good news
The bad new and the good news is I love with all my heart
And a loving heart will be my true companion
When all else has abandoned for loving of their own
And a loving heart will fill my days with gladness
Make joy out of sadness when I bring this loving heart to you
I long to be a happy man, in this life that I've been given
In this life that I've been given I long to be a happy man
When the noise turns to stillness I see I have the makings
I see I have the makings to be one happy man
You might also likeAnd a happy man will be my true companion
When all else has abandoned for happy of their own
And a happy man will fill my days with gladness
Make joy out of sadness when I show this happy man
And a happy man will be my true companion
When all else has abandoned for happy of their own
And a happy man will fill my days with gladness
Make joy out of sadness when I bring this happy man to you
I walk a crooked road to get where I am going
To get where I am going I must walk a crooked road
And only when I'm looking back I see the straight and narrow
