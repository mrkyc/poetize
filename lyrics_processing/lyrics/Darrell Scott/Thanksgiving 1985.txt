My stepdad's name is Rodney
I guess he's been okay to me
He says things when he's drinking
Mostly I just let it pass
But sometimes I wish you were here
You'd take him out and kick his ass
Yeah you'd take him out and kick his ass

They say the war was winding down
When you took that AK-47 'round
Jackson from your company
Calls me now and then
He says he kept a picture of me in your tent
Showed it off to everybody who came in
He's gonna come down and visit sometime from Bethlehem

You'd've carved the turkey
We'd've pulled the wishbone you and me
Instead of him and that stupid grin
"Honey don't cook let's go out again
Get in the car boy lets take a ride
Instant mashed potatoes Kentucky Fried"
A lot of things would have been different here
Thanksgiving 1985
You might also like
And that old fender you left behind
Mom says you loved it and now its mine
I've been taking lessons
It feels good and I can play
And just like you I dig Hendrix too
And this other dude named Stevie Ray
Man I wish you could hear him play

You'd've carved the turkey
We'd've pulled the wishbone you and me
Instead of him and that stupid grin
"Honey don't cook let's go out again
Get in the car boy lets take a ride
Instant mashed potatoes Kentucky Fried"
A lot of things would have been different here
Thanksgiving 1985

My sister's five and I'm sixteen
Feels a little bit in between
My girlfriend goes to a different school
Her name is Jan and she's sixteen too
And I've got an old car I've been working on
It's a rusted out Dodge from '72
It's kinda funny how that'd be new to you
Dad I feel myself drifting off
The day was hard and this pillow's soft
I know you're listening
And you hear every word I say
I don't mean to bum you out
It's just that today was a real bad day
But listen tomorrow, you can hear me play
