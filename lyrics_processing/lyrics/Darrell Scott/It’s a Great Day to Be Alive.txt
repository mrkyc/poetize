I got rice cooking in the microwave
I got a three day beard, I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, I'm doing all right
I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feeling pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no I'm just doing all right

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining when I close my eyes
It's hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's been fifteen years since I left home
Said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best, then I left it alone
I hope they're doing all right
Redbird, redbird what do you see?
He says, "I see a lone wolf looking at me
Head in the clouds but harmless as a tree
I guess he's doing all right"

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining when I close my eyes
It's hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

Sometimes it's lonely
Sometimes it's only me and the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling, howling at the moon
Awooo
Awooo

It's a colorful life that we go through
It's neither black or white, nor just shades of blue
Maybe I'll grow me a fu man chu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining when I close my eyes
It's hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining when I close my eyes
It's hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good
