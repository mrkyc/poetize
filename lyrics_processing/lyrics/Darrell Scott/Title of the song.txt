First you get their attention like "Hey look at me" (Look at me)
Then you throw some chords around it no more than three
And you talk about love or love that's gone wrong
And you end it all off with the title of the song

Title of the song, title of the song
When left ain't right, what's right ain't wrong
Cain't be more than three minutes long
End it all off with the title of the song

It's boy meets girl, girl meets boy
It's good to be clever but you better be coy
Get 'em all line dancing like old King Kong
End it all off with the title of the song

Title of the song, title of the song
When left ain't right, what's right ain't wrong
Cain't be more than three minutes long
End it all off with the title of the song

This here's the bridge
It don't say too much, you see
But it don't have to, it just takes us all from A to B to C to D to yeah
You might also likeBring it down boys, bring it down

Well I've told you everything about music I know
You aim for platinum but you settle for gold
You shoot you country video with old Cheech and Chong
And you end it all off with the title of the song

Title of the song, title of the song
When left ain't right, what's right ain't wrong
Cain't be more than three minutes long
End it all off with the title of the song
I said end it all off with the title of the song
Yeah end it all off with the title of the song
Yeah, woo!
Yeaheee

...Through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine
