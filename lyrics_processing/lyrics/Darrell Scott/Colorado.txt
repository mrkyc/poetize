From this sorrow I've been feeling
Give me old souls with healing hands
The misunderstood, surely they will understand
It takes a goddess touch to touch a godless man
And get him back to believing
Give me a small-town mayor who should be dead
But, he trades in old guitars and art instead
Well, he brought the fish and I brought the bread
And he says, miracles still happen
Colorado, I need healing
From this sorrow I've been feeling
Coyote walks through the light of day
He hides behind a rock like he had plans to stay
And I never did know just what he meant to say
But I can tell you, I was listening
And there was Pedro with his cigarette sleeves
Full of Friday pay and rattlesnake dreams
He shared his Marlboros and I shared my cheese
His steady eyes were glistening
And I heard an uplifting sound in a downtown park
Playing his own tunes on an Irish harp
And he played with just one hand as the August sky grew dark
The other hand was for a lover
Colorado, I need healing
From this sorrow I've been feeling
I need your ancient winds to dry these tears
I need your silver lakes to be my mirrors
I closed my eyes and met this song
And the whole damn state of Colorado sang along
And I knew right then that somewhere I belonged
But hey, I know I was only dreaming
So I'm gonna take what little's left of me
Strap me in a plane eastbound for Tennossee
Cause a man can only take so much being free
And then he starts to charging
Colorado, I need healing
From this sorrow I've been feeling
I need Chautauqua wind to dry these tears
I need your silver lakes to be my mirrors
So that I might see the fool I've been
And maybe I can then begin again
