Beelzebub and chosen one have both been in cahoots
They play us like gin rummy and they're cheating on the side
While we gaze into a broken mirror like Frankenstein's bride
I wish someone could tell me something I don't already know
It's been some hard living, still got a ways to go
Rooster in the hen house, hit man on the phone
Low man on the totem pole, can't get no time alone
I've been seeking satisfaction for this gnawing in my soul
I build a house like Andrew Jackson if that were my only goal
I'm looking for a change to come but brother, change comes slow
And it's been some hard living, still got a ways to go, ho ho ho
I look outside at this beautiful day
Sun is shining, lighting up my way
I gotta get out of here and get me a fishing pole
It's been some hard living and I still got a ways to go
I pontificate, I suffocate, I overate
(My, my)
I've been wearily, sincerely, too lonesome now to cry
Gawking, squawking, talking from a patent leather couch
Working through my childish hood beyond the shadows and the doubts
Oh, ye of little consequence, please cast that first precious stone
'Cause it's been some hard, hard living and I still got a ways to go
You might also likeI look outside and it's starting to rain
'round the curve comes a passenger train
Northbound freight on a south bound track
Yeah, she's alright leaving but she won't be coming back
I look outside at this beautiful day
Sun is shining, man, it's lighting up my way
I gotta get out of here and get me a fishing pole
It's been some hard living and I still got a ways to go
