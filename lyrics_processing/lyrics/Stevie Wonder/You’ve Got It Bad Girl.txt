When you believe in a feeling
That's holding you back from my love
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl
When you insist on excluding
The tenderness that's in my kiss
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

If you try to display an emotion that will contradict itself
You will find your heart just sitting
Like a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf

Should you depend on an outlet
Through which an escape can be found
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl
If you don't see there's no way out
Just no way of getting 'round me
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

Yes, you know the plans I am making are intended to capture you
So you practice false reaction
To delay the things I do, the things I do, things I do
Oh foolish you
You might also like
You've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)
You've got it bad girl (You've got it bad girl)
Mmm hmm, yeah yeah
You've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)
You've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)

There's no reward in detouring, my deep sincerity
Especially since what you're feeling
Is perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me

Before you discover the feeling
You've tried very hard to hide
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl
But when you can find just a small space
To let my love live in your mind
Then you'll have it good girl, you'll have it good girl

You'll have it good girl (You'll have it good girl)
You'll have it good girl (You'll have it good)
You'll have it good girl
(You'll have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good girl)
You'll have it good girl
You'll have it good girl (You'll have it good, you'll have it good)
You'll have it good girl
(You'll have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good)
You'll have it good girl (Baby baby)
You'll have it good girl
