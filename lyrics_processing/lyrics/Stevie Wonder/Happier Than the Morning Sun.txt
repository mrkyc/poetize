I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

All my life, I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
But now, I see there's joy inside your heart
Every day, I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now, I see this star is on Earth

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
(That's what you told me, yeah)
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
(That's the way it will always be)
Ever since the day you came inside my life

(Baby, that's what you told me, yeah)
If I should ever bring you inside my life
I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be

If I should ever bring you inside my life
