Uh, uh, uh

I will rob and steal with you, dog nigga what
Ride 'till we die, on 'till it's up
Thick like blood, where's my dogs?
Uh, there's my dogs
I will rob and steal with you, dog nigga what
Ride 'till we die, on till it's up
Thick like blood, where's my dogs
Uh, there's my dogs

Now who I am is who I'll be until I die
Either accept it or don't fuck with it, but if we gon' be dogs then you stuck with it!
Let me go my way but walk with me
See what I see, watch me then, talk with me
Share my pain, make it a little easier to deal with it (Aight)
'Cause despite all the fame, you, I'm a keep it real with it (True)!
Rob and steal wit' - dog nigga what
Ride till we die, on till it's up
Love is love and I enjoy the love
But when it's conflict then it destroys the love
You can't toy with love, niggas take it to the heart
You ain't gon' find too many niggas willing to, bark in the dark (Come on)
Keep your head from the start, don't fuck it up now
Later on it hit like, "Fuck it up how?"
You my dog and I die for you, let's keep it like that
Give me unconditional love and I give it right back (For real)

Most niggas make movies, but niggas like us make it happen
The shit we used to do never thought we would make it rappin'
But now we here, at the same place at the same time
And got jokes cause now niggas get it, with the same rhyme
Yeah niggas is living comfortable, cause life is all good
But one thing we must remember, is that life is all hood
And the casket's all wood and we all take it there one day (shit)
Shit today is Sunday we both can be there on Monday
Life is funny like that (What) bugged the fuck out
Sometimes I take it to the church, sometimes I thug the fuck out
Niggas get drugged the fuck out they boots, violatin' family rules
Motherfucker stay in your shoes!
