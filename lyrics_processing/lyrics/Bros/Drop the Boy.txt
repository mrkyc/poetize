Doo-da-da oh
I get down to dry my hair with a little touch of gel
I read all the newspapers but my mother still reads my mail
Oho
Oooh, yeah
I won't wish my life away so tell me if you can
Who decides when I'm grown up and turned into a man
Drop the boy, drop the boy (Oooh, oh)
I'm the man, yes, I am (I'm the man)
But they still call me boy (So just drop it, oooh)
Drop the boy, drop the boy (Oooh, oh)
I'm the man, yes, I am (I'm the man)
And I'll be jumping for joy
When they drop the boy, oooh
When they drop the boy, doo-da-dey
I'm tired of the boy thing, I've got other things to do
I'd like to be in politics, can't take another visit to the zoo
Oooh, oooh, yeah
