Well, not too long ago in nineteen forty-four
When every mother's son was goin' off to war
They had to lift they spirits high (High!)
For Uncle Sam, motherhood and apple pie
Instead of spendin' money that they didn't have
In hot spots in the Bronx
They went to hear the kind of jazz
You hear in funky honky-tonks
It made you wanna
Jump (jump!), shout (shout!), knock yourself out
A boogie-woogie beat is what I'm talkin' about
If you had the heebie-jeebies you could dance away
To the boogie-woogie music the piano man was playin'
You could jump (jump!), shout (shout!), knock yourself out
A boogie-woogie beat is what I'm talkin' about
You could pull a switcheroonie if you felt low down
With the boogie-woogie beat of a piano man who's goin' to town
(doot, doot, doot doo, yeah)
(doot, doot, doot doo, yeah)
See Barry Manilow LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also likeIt had the kind of rhythm that would fill the hall
The plinkin' and the plunkin' drove 'em up the wall
And they would dance and drink their gin (yeah!)
And when the fuzz (fuzz) buzzed (buzzed), they'd join in
So everybody partied 'till the cows came home
'cause that's what boogie's for
And every night that dump would jump (jump, jump)
And keep 'em comin' back for more
Because it made you wanna
Jump (jump!), shout (shout!), knock yourself out
A boogie-woogie beat is what I'm talkin' about
If you had the heebie-jeebies you could dance away
To the boogie-woogie music the piano man was playin'
You could jump (jump!), shout (shout!), knock yourself out
A boogie-woogie beat is what I'm talkin' about

With the boogie-woogie beat of a piano man who's goin' to town

It made you wanna
Jump (jump!), shout (shout!)
(Foo-der-acka-sacki)
Wanna jump (jump!), shout (shout!)
(Slip the talcum to me Malcom)
You wanna jump (jump!), shout (shout!)
(Floy-doy, floy-doy)
To the boogie-woogie music the piano man was playin'
You could jump (jump!), shout (shout!), knock yourself out
A boogie-woogie beat is what I'm talkin' about
You could pull a switcheroonie if you felt low down
To the boogie-woogie beat of a piano, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha
