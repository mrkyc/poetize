Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair
And a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar

Across the crowded floor
They worked from eight 'til four
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?

At the Copa, Copacabana (Copa, Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)
At the Copa, Copacabana (Copacabana)
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the Copa, they fell in love
(Copa, Copacabana)

His name was Rico, he wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair
He saw Lola dancing there
And when she finished, he called her over
But Rico went a bit too far
Tony sailed across the bar

And then the punches flew
And chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gunshot
But just who shot who?

At the Copa, Copacabana (Copa, Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)
At the Copa, Copacabana (Copacabana)
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the Copa, she lost her love
(Copa, Copacabana)

(Copacabana)
(Music and passion)
(Always in fashion)

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago
When they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined
And drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind

At the Copa, Copacabana (Copa, Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)
At the Copa, Copacabana (Copacabana)
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the Copa, don't fall in love
(Copa, Copacabana) Don't fall in love
(Copacabana, Copacabana)
