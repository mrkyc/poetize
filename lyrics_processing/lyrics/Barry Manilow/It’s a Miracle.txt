You wouldn't believe where I've been
The cities and towns I've been in
From Boston to Denver
And every town in between

(Everyone looks the same)
The people they all look the same
(Yes, the same)
Oh, only the names have been changed
(Just the names)
But now that I'm home again
I'll tell you what I believe

It's a miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true
(Whoa ohh ohh ohh)
We're together, baby
I was going crazy
Till the miracle came through
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
Now you're here and my arms are around you
And, baby, there'll be dancing in the street
For the miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
(Woo! Hoo hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo!)

To ever have gone away

You know that I'm home to stay
