I'm singin' to the world, it's time we let the spirit come in
Let it come on in
I'm singin' to the world, everybody's caught in the spin
Look at where we've been

We've been runnin' around, year after year
Blinded with pride, blinded with fear

But it's daybreak, if you wanna believe
It can be daybreak, ain't no time to grieve
Said it's daybreak if you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world

(Sing it to the world, sing it, sing it)
(Sing it to the world, sing it, sing it)

Singin' to the world, what's the point in puttin' it down?
There's so much love to share
I'm singin' to the world, don't you see it all comes around?
The feeling's everywhere

We've been closin' our eyes, day after day
Covered in clouds, losin' our way

Hey, but it's daybreak, if you wanna believe
It can be daybreak, ain't no time to grieve
Said it's daybreak if you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world

(Everyone sing it, sing it to the world)
(Everyone sing it, sing it to the world)

Yes, and it's daybreak, if you wanna believe
It can be daybreak, ain't no time to grieve
Said it's daybreak if you'll only believe
And let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world
(Everyone sing it, sing it to the world)
Come on, and let it shine, shine, shine
All around the world

(Sing it to the world, sing it, sing it)
(Sing it to the world, sing it, sing it)
Hey, it's daybreak (Sing it to the world, sing it, sing it)
Can you feel it's daybreak? (Sing it to the world, sing it, sing it)
Can you see it's daybreak? (Sing it to the world, sing it, sing it)
