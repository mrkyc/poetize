We're goin' hoppin' today
Where things are poppin' (Pop)
The Philadelphia way
We're gonna drop in (Drop)
On all the music they play
On the Bandstand (Bandstand)
We're goin' swingin' (Swing)
We're gonna swingin' the crowd
And we'll be clingin' (Cling)
And floatin' high as a cloud
The phones are ringin' (Ring)
My mom and dad are so proud
I'm on Bandstand (Bandstand)
And I'll jump, and hey, I may even show 'em my handstand
Because I'm on, because I'm on the American Bandstand
When we dance real slow I'll show all the guys in the grandstand
What a swinger I am, I am on American Bandstand
We're goin' hoppin
We're goin' hoppin today
Where things are poppin
The Philadelphia way
We're gonna drop in
On all the music they play
On the Bandstand (Bandstand)

Hey I'm makin' my mark
Gee, this joint is jumpin'
They made such a fuss just to see us arrive
Hey, it's Mr. Dick Clark
What a place you've got here
Swell spot the music's hot here
Best in the east, give it at least a seventy five!
Now for all you Joe's here goes my American handstand
Because I'm on, because I'm on the American Bandstand
As we dance real slow I'm showin' the guys in the grandstand
That I like my girl, but I love American Bandstand
The singers' croonin'
He ain't the greatest but gee
My baby's swoonin'
In front of all of TV
So if you tune in
You'll see my baby and me
On the Bandstand (Bandstand)
And now we're hoppin
And we'll be hopppin all day
When things are poppin
The Philadelphia way
And you can drop in
On all the music they play
On the Bandstand

Lindy hop and slop, it's American
Tune in, I'm on
Turn on, I'm in, I'm on
