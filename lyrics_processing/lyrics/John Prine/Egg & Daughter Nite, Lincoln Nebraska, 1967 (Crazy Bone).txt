If you like your apples sweet
And your streets are not concrete
You'll be in your bed by nine every night
Take your hand-spanked, corn-fed gal
And your best friend's four-eyed pal
To a treat right down the street, that's dynamite

Let your conscience be your guide
If you put your foot inside
You'll wish you left your well-enough alone
When you got hell to pay
Put the truth on layaway
And blame it on that old Crazy Bone

Crazy Bone (Crazy Bone)
Crazy Bone (Crazy Bone)
Well you wished you'd left your well-enough alone
When you got hell to pay
Put the truth on layaway
And blame it on that old Crazy Bone

Don't be stuck up in Alaska
When you should be in Nebraska
On a Thursday when it's Egg & Daughter Nite
When the farmers come to town
And they spread them eggs around
And they drop their daughters down at the roller rink
You might also like
Well you're probably standin' there
With your slicked-back Brylcreem hair
Your Lucky's and your daddy's fine-toothed comb
If they knew what you were thinkin'
They'd run you out of Lincoln
Just blame it on that old Crazy Bone

Crazy Bone (crazy bone)
Crazy Bone (crazy bone)
Well you must have left your wisdom tooth at home
If they knew what you were thinkin'
They'd run you out of Lincoln
Blame it on the old Crazy Bone

When the grandkids all are grown
And they put you in a home
And eternity is approachin' fast
Yeah you're half out of your head
And you probably pissed the bed
And you can't see a thing to save your ass

And far across the prairie (prairie)
In the local cemetery ('tery)
They already got your name carved out in stone
When all them nurses say
"Grandpa why you walk that way?"
Just blame it on that old Crazy Bone
Yeah blame it on that old
Crazy Bone (Crazy Bone)
Crazy Bone (Crazy Bone)
And everybody in that old folks' home
If they knew what you were thinkin'
They'd run you out of Lincoln
Just blame it on that old Crazy Bone
And everybody in that old folks' home
