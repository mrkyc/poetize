Woke up this morning, put on my slippers
Walked in the kitchen and died
And oh, what a feeling when my soul went through the ceiling
And on up into heaven I did ride

When I got there they did say, "John, it happened this a-way
You slipped upon the floor and hit your head
And all the angels say just before you passed away
These were the very last words that you said"

Please don't bury me down in the cold cold ground
No, I'd druther have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears, if they don't mind the size

Give my stomach to Milwaukee if they run out of beer
Put my socks in a cedar box, just get 'em out of here
Venus de Milo can have my arms, look out, I've got your nose
Sell my heart to the junkman and give my love to Rose

But please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
No, I'd druther have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears, if they don't mind the size
You might also like

Give my feet to the footloose, careless, fancy free
Give my knees to the needy, don't pull that stuff on me
Hand me down my walking cane, it's a sin to tell a lie
Send my mouth way down south and kiss my ass goodbye

But please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
No, I'd druther have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes
