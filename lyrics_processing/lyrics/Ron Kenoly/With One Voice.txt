And tambourines
Call up the trumpets and horns
Raise up a banner
And come with me
It's time to worship the Lord
Praise Him together in unity
We've got a reason to sing
Lift up a heavenly harmony
It's time to worship the King
With one voice
Every tribe will praise Him
With one voice
Every tongue will tell
That the Lord is good
And His love endures
And His mercy lasts forever
With one voice
Come and worship
Lift your voice
We will worship
With one voice
Come and worship
With one voice
