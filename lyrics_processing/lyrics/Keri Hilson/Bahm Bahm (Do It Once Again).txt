I run, I jump, I fly
Oh me, oh you, oh we, oh my
Your love, it takes me high
So real, so true, I can't lie
Oh boy, you got me going crazy (Bahm bahm)
I think I want to have your babies (Bahm bahm)
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
When you come around me, me get weak in the knees
Boy stay, oh please don't leave
I need you by my side and I'm begging you please
I think your loving is amazing (Bahm bahm)
Oh boy, your heart, you're really blazing

When you grind up on me
Love up on me, touch up on me
Do it once again
Grind up on me, love up on me, touch up on me
Do it once again

(Bahm) I win your heart
I tried to do everything you want, do everything you like (Bahm)
I need you to get mine
If I can't have you, I think I'm gonna cry
You never gave me, not one warning (Bahm bahm)
Now boy your loving is a problem (Call the police)
Call 911, I'm hooked, I'm shook
I've fallen, I can't get up (Bahm)
Your lips, your body, your touch
Got me in a trans- or can't get enough
You're too much for me and I can't take it
Oh boy, you got my body shaking
