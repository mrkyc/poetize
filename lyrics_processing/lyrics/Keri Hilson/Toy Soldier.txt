So I guess I fell in love, with a toy soldier

He told me that our love would be marching on
Hoorah, hoorah
He told me that our love was mighty strong
Hoorah, hoorah
And guess I believed you, 'cause you were my baby
Why would I doubt you, when you said you loved me?
But I didn't know you were the enemy

The only who made me cry, is you
And the only one I had to fight, is you
And it was you who told me, yeah

He said, that I would never have to fight again
He said, that I would never have to cry again
He said he'd had been to the battlefield
My heart is safe with him
All my trust, I gave it to him
So I guess I fell in love with a toy soldier

You told me that you would take care of me, you lied, you lied
You told me that you was the best for me, you lied, you lied
'Cause you came up empty
I feel like you're tricked me
Everything you said you'd give me, you couldn't give me
Yeah, oh

But who protects me now?

Ooh, you let me down
