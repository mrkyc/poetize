In A Perfect World, your girl
In A Perfect World, your girl
In A Perfect World]
So much has changed
Two years have passed
Who would have though I'd cross your path
Memories of you came flashing back
No question why we didn't last
I know it was me it wasn't you
I couldn't commit to loving you
But now in a dream, I dream of you
It took seeing you to know the truth
Cos
In A Perfect World, I'd still be your girl
In A Perfect World, I'd still be your girl
In A Perfect World, I'd still be your girl
In A Perfect World
The sun and the moon may never meet
That's the story of you and me
I feel like a song that's out of key
Cos I see you with another girl

Be the one you hold on to at night
I'd be, more than just a friend in your life
Baby
Maybe I'd even be your wife
Cos without you in my life

In A Perfect World, I'd still be your girl
