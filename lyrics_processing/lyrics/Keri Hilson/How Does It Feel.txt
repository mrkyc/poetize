Keri, talk

I'm startin' to think I need space
Now every time I go out, you all in my face
Soon as I hit the door, why you gotta be actin' so insecure?
Where I been? Who I was with?
Boy, you stressin' me out with this (Watch this)
Our relationship was supposed to revolve around trust, right?
But let's take it back a few months, like
What about the other chick that you was kickin' it with?
Man, I'm gettin' sick of it
Damn it, it's a shame, a sin
You about to get a dose of your medicine
You couldn't even handle me
If the shoe was on the other foot now

So what you gonna do when I don't give you that last chance?
And how you gonna act when you see me in the back with a new man?
And what's it gonna be when you could see me and him holdin' hands?
I bet you'd give a damn then

You could keep on feelin' yourself, I'ma be with somebody else
Gotta keep it real with yourself, before you end up by yourself
Gotta keep it real with yourself, before you end up by yourself
How does it feel?

Now you threatin' to leave me so
But ordinarily, I would be biting my tongue
But, you couldn't picture me gone
Thought I be sittin' at home while you was doing me wrong
You know it's messin with my head, thoughts of her up in my bed
And if I did what you did to me? How would it be?
If the shoe was on the other foot now?

I could wild out, take the knuckle route, but I got class
So what you gonna do when I pimp out I've got a new romance?
Then what you have, turns into what you had
I bet you'd give a damn then
You could keep on feelin' yourself, I'ma be with somebody else
Gotta keep it real with yourself, before you end up by yourself
You could keep on feelin' yourself, I'ma be with somebody else
Gotta keep it real with yourself, before you end up by yourself

Baby, do you know what I gone through? (How does it feel?)
Sittin' up waiting for you? (How does it feel?)
(How does it feel?)
If that was you, you'd be gone, baby, you're slippin' on me (How does it feel?)

You could keep on feelin' yourself, I'ma be with somebody else
Gotta keep it real with yourself, before you end up by yourself
You could keep on feelin' yourself, I'ma be with somebody else
Gotta keep it real with yourself, before you end up by yourself
How does it feel?

You would find out how it feels (Feels)
Oh, how does it feel?
Oh, how does it feel?
Oh, how does it feel?
