Dearly beloved
You were brought here today
To make this thing called (Can you do it?)
Love (Well, can you prove it?)
Such a beautiful thing (Well, can you touch it?)
Can you feel it, daddy? (Well, can you love it?)
If you really know what it is
Can you do it?

Tell me how any other girls done heard this
Sounds a little like you might rehearse this, oh
Yeah, you talk a real good game
But it's worthless if you can't work this
Don't look so nervous

All you gotta do is ask about me and you'll find out I'ma boss
When it comes to the get down, get down
Ooh enough said, you might have to come through
And show me how you do

Can you do it? (I can do it)
Then do it to me
Well, can you prove it? (I can prove it)
Better than me
Well, can you touch it? (I can touch it)
Like I really need
Well, can you love it? (I can love it)
Then give it to me
Just do it
Just do it to me
Just do it
Just do it to me
Just do it
Just do it to me
Just do it
Just do it to me
