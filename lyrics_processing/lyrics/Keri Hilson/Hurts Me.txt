I'm standing at the fork in the road
And I
Don't really know which way to go, It's like
Seventeen years ago all over again, and I
I'm a little girl lost alone, and yes
I wanna know what lies ahead, and yeah
My feet are planted
And I don't wanna take a step

'CauseI won't make it any further with you on my back
Carry your burden, I can't do it this time
Goodbye
Then again
Do I listen to my heart? Do I cry for help?
I keep second guessing myself
Why does it have to be so (Be so) hard to let you go? Oh

It's almost sun down
I gotta put my foot down
And I know if I do
It's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you
I know how much you need me
Breaks my heart, believe me
Now I know what I gotta do
But it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you
More than it hurts you
More than it hurts you
But it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you
More than it hurts you
More than it hurts you
But it's gonna hurt me

Now ordinarily, I wouldn't give up, I'm no quitter
But under the circumstance
I think it's better that I wash my hands of ya, love ya
But I'm thinking that I can't live with ya, can't live without ya
It's something about ya that makes me wanna stick around
And stay settled down
Even if it kills me, but I can't

'Cause I won't make it any further with you on my back
Carry your burden, I can't do it this time (can't do it this time)
Goodbye (Goodbye), then again
Do I listen to my heart? Do I cry for help?
I keep second guessing myself
Why does it have to be so (Be so) hard to let you go? Oh, whoa

It's almost sun down
I gotta put my foot down
And I know if I do
It's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you
I know how much you need me
Breaks my heart, believe me
Now I know what I gotta do
But it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you (It's gonna hurt me)
(Hurt you) More than it hurts you (Hurts you)
More than it hurts you (More than it hurts)
But it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts you (Hurts you, yeah)
More than it hurts you (Said it's gonna hurt you, babe)
More than it hurts you
But it's gonna hurt me
I'm walking away like...
Goodbye
You got me walking away like...
