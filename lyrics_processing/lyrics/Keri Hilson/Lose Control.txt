Hey
Hey, hey

I know I've been telling you not now
But baby, come and give it to me
'Cause I can tell by the way that you move
That you're the one who could give it to me, yeah
So come on, let's move through the crowd
So we can find ourselves some privacy
And when I get you all to myself
I promise it's gonna be hard to breathe
When you watch me

Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control (Control)
Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control (Control)
Put your hands on my body, I
Love the way you make my body say, I, I, I
Shake, wind and roll, let's lose control (Control)

Shake, wind and roll
Shake, wind and roll
