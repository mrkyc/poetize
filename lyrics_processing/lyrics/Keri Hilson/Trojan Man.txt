Uh, Lifestyles of the magnum lovers
This is for my girls who only love covers

Said you got a surprise
And your headed down the highway
Baby I'm so excited
Cause I wanna have you my way
From the very first night
That we hit it off  hit it off 
There was something on your mind
Let me help you get
It off  get it off 

Tell me what you wanna do now 
If I get in the mood 
If we take it there 
Cause I'm hooked on, following down-
And if you lead me on-
Get me out of my zone
Baby I can tell you really want it
And I got you (wrapped upx3)
Even in the heat of the moment
Said I need you (wrapped up x3)

You pull up to the truck-
And you wanna let it bump
Boy you better be a-
(Trojan Man)
Want more than a kiss?
If you want this, boy you better be a-
(Trojan Man)
Or it ain't happening..
Never leave home without it-
Or you gotta 
Never leave home without it-
Or you gotta 

Im feeling the vibe
No, we won't need it right away
No, lets take our time
Just keep it in the hideaway
I've waited so long
Since we hit it off  hit it off 
Now there's something on my body
Can you help me get It off  get it off 

Tell me what you wanna do now 
If I get in the mood 
If we take it there 
Cause I'm hooked on, following down-
And if you lead me on-
Get me out of my zone
Baby I can tell you really want it

Never leave home without it-
Or you gotta
