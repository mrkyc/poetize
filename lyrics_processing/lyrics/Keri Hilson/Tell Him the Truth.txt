If you've ever kept a secret from the one you love
This is what it feels like

If you thought that I was perfect
Boy, you were wrong
I'm far from that
There's one thing that I've done to you
That I regret and
Look, I know it's no excuse, but I'm only human and young at that
And I'm gonna make mistakes
And hope you understand

Didn't see it comin'
Wasn't on purpose
Baby, I promise I didn't mean to hurt you
Will you forgive me? You didn't deserve this
I know it wasn't worth it

I'ma tell him the truth (When I'm ready to)
Tell him the truth (Somehow)
Gotta tell him the truth (That's what I gotta do)
Tell him the truth (But not now)
Gotta tell him the truth (Just wait a little bit)
Tell him the truth (He couldn't handle it)
Tell him the truth (That's what I gotta do)
Tell him the truth (But not now, ooh)

Didn't see when I had tears rolling down my face
I turned my back
It was heavy on the tongue
(And I knew that you knew something was wrong)
I was about to break open, spill out everything
But something said
"Keri, wait, things are going great, what you gonna say?"
"I don't know, maybe something like..."

I feel less (Than nothin')
Lower (Than zero)
And tired (Of frontin)
Gotta tell him the truth, ooh
I feel less (Than nothin')
Lower (Than zero)
And tired (Of frontin)
Gotta tell him the truth, ooh
Guess I've been waitin' for the stars to align
There's no perfect time
I gotta tell him the truth
'Cause it's hard to build the truth on a lie
And if that's what I want
I gotta tell him the truth

I'ma tell him the truth (When I'm ready to)

Tell him the truth (That's what I gotta do)
Tell him the truth, I gotta (But not now, ooh)
Baby, I'm cryin'
I'm, I'm cryin'
Ohh
Tell him the truth (That's what I gotta do)
Tell him the truth (That's what I gotta do)
I'm so scared, and I'm sittin' here all alone
Tell him the truth
