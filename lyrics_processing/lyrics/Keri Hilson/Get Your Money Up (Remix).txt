Uh huh, yo yo I need all the dudes in the club
Get ya money out
(Let's get 'em Keri)
Stop, now let me see your booty drop

If you think you impressin' us with your ice and your dub
Poppin' bottles in the club, get your money up (Uh-huh)
'Cause I ain't your average girl, I've been all around the world
With your boy, wanna wow me?
Then get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
I wanna see something bigger than a Hummer truck
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You gotta throw something bigger than a hundred bucks

Now slide slide one of them black cards
If you got it, then show me how you're gettin' it
Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them
Might even act a fool while you're hittin' it
When you see me in my thang, blow a whole lot of change
Let the bottle get jealous, get your money up
And if you don't like us, there's nothing to discuss
We don't even give a fuck, get your money up

And still livin' with your momma

If you ridin' big whips, can't take care of your kids
Why you lookin' at me?
Get your money up
When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll
Them bottles pop, nonstop
You up in Hollywood, you know how we roll, stop!
Now let me see your booty drop

Catchin' what I'm talkin' about, I don't wanna hear your mouth
You needa put some money down, or get your money up
Why you invadin' my space? Why you get up in my face?
I ain't got nothing to say, but get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You know I wanna see something better than the autobus
Get your money up, boy

You know my bottle cost more than a hundred bucks

Okay now, slide slide one of them black cards
If you got it then show me how your getting it
Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them
I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it
Now grind, grind
Get you some big money and don't forget about me when you're spendin' it
But if you ain't gon' pay, don't be screamin' out, "Hey girl"
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)

Yo yo yo yo
Big meals. I think I'm gettin the 'itis
I big ball, that ain't no elephantitis
Three girl play, so I'm tripling my value
Keri steal, Keyshia pass, Nicki with the alley oop
More bottles then a wine-o
Then with a coupe, all-white albino
And you know it's going down, like draino
Cause when I come out, it's a zoo with a rhino
Ok, he know he's gonna have to step up on a C-note
Starbucks Hazelnut Vanilla Cappucino
Rose, Greeco

Get your Brinks truck, I'm flyer than Darkwing Duck
