You know I, I had my, my vices
You said you could handle it
But you lied 'cause you tried to change me, mold me, no

Everything you loved before you don't love no more
Everything I did for you, you don't want no more
Maybe I'm not king of girl you been looking for
Would you agree? So how could you not see it?
