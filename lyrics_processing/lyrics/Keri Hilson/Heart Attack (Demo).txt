There's a feelin I can't express and it isn't pain
Palpitations in my chest that I can't explain
(baby you the cause and cure everything the doctor is for)
Your the medicine for the state I'm in my love prescription
(You make me weak in the knees you make me scream baby please)
Call the ambulance and check me in, cause it hit me

It hit me like a heart attack I never knew that love can knock me over like that (oh yes it did)
My feet it started skippin and my heart started trippin when you walked into the room
I wasn't ready for no heart attack I never knew that love can knock me over like that (never never knew boy)
Somebody call the peramedic and tell them to get my room ready just in case I can't get over you

Sometimes I swear Im bout to die what can I take
Cause this infliction that I got so hard to shake Oh yes it is darling
