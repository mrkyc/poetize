*Right About Now*
Aaahh!

You can't treat me like no basic bitch
I'm Grade A approved and just face it
I don't think you know who you playin' with
I could have bettered your image
You wasn't shit before I met you
When I leave they gon' forget you
I put you onto that vintage
Chanel and BVLGARI, Versace, Cavalli
You had so much potential though
Homie tell me, where did it go?
Now you just frontin' and actin'
If you ain't addin' you subtractin'

You mistakin' me for somebody else
But see you're only foolin' yourself
You ain't got nothin' I want
I'm way better with you gone
See Keri Hilson LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
I was cool all by my lonesome, oh until you came alone
You convinced me to be loyal while you go do what you want
If I did the same to you, oh you would tell me that I'm wrong
I ain't gon' lie, I would respect you if you knew to...

Keep it 100 with me (100!)
100, 100 (100, 100 with me!)
Homie can you keep it G? (G!)
100, 100 (100!)
Say that you come from the streets (the streets!)
100, 100 (well keep it 100 then!)
Keep it 100 with me (damn!)
100, 100 (100!)

Sometimes I feel you're worse than a bitch
Why you be actin' all scary?
If you did it, you did it, just say the shit
At least have the kahunas to tell me
Now you watchin' from the outside
I can see you, what you lookin' at?
When you was on the inside
I noticed how much you was feelin' yourself
Fuck you and whoever you're screwin'
Don't care no more 'bout what you're doin'
Hope she cheat on you and leave you ruined
I'm so turnt up cause you went and pissed me off
You mistakin' me for somebody else
But see you're only foolin' yourself
You ain't got nothin' I want
I'm way better with you gone

I was cool all by my lonesome, oh until you came alone
You convinced me to be loyal while you go do what you want
If I did the same to you, oh you would tell me that I'm wrong
I ain't gon' lie, I would respect you if you knew to...

Keep it 100 with me (100!)
100, 100 (100, 100 with me!)
Homie can you keep it G? (G!)
100, 100 (100!)
Say that you come from the streets (the streets!)
100, 100 (well keep it 100 then!)
Keep it 100 with me (damn!)
100, 100 (100!)

I'ma keep this shit 100, damn
She the bomb like Osama
Keep it real, I'ma let you meet my mama
Don't care if you blow it back like condom
All these 100s, niggas, only commas
Diamonds bright like the inside of a tunnel
Keri think I'm Ben Franklin cause I'm 100
Stack them Ms and live every day like the summer
I'ma pull up kickin' shit like I'm a punter
Catch me ridin' with my dogs like a hunter
Keep ice on like a fuckin' penguin
Baby know I'm rock solid like the cement
I'll change seasons for no reason
I might fuck her and leave her if she don't...
Keep it 100 with me (100!)
100, 100 (100, 100 with me!)
Homie can you keep it G? (G!)
100, 100 (100!)
Say that you come from the streets (the streets!)
100, 100 (well keep it 100 then!)
Keep it 100 with me (damn!)
