Come here, baby
Sometimes, I just wanna dance with you
Hold me like this
Just rock with me

Put your arms around me, boy
I got somethin' to show ya, tonight
And you know I need your undivided attention, baby (Whoa)
Ain't no other girl can rock your world like I

So, rewind
Make this moment last forever, baby
It feels like your body's callin' me
But I don't...

I don't (Don't)
Want to (Don't want to)
Come on (Come on)
Too strong
But something happens when we slow dance (When we slow dance)
I try to be (Be)
Lady like (Lady like)
But I got you (You)
Here tonight (Tonight)
But somethin' happens when we slow dance (When we slow dance)
