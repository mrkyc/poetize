I-I still remember that funny look
On your face when I finally told you
I'd be on my way (I'd be on my way, hey)
You called me crazy, said I'm out my mind
I said but if I stay here, it'll be a waste of time
I-I really gotta go, gotta get out of here
I'm running, gotta continue my journey

'Cause the lying and declining, know that I'm off that
I ain't tryna go back to when it was all that
Boy, when you had me, you ain't know how to act
Now when you call my phone, I don't even call back
Hey, 'cause I'm too good for all that
I wanna give this love back if I could (My love is so good)
You wish you could get this girl back
You miss me 'cause my love was so good

(My love is so good) So good, so good
So good, so good
So good, so good
So good, so good
So good, so good

All I remember was smoking mirrors
Making pictures, raging temper
With him, it's different
Look what you did to us
You used to find it hard to tell me
You love me, now you need me
I find it so hard, hard to believe that you want me back
Well, I ain't in no rush
Everything that you wanted was yours
Love was right in your face, now it ain't no more

'Cause the lying and declining, know that
I'm off that
I ain't tryna go back to when it was all that
Boy, when you had me, you ain't know how to act
Now when you call my phone, I don't even call back
Hey, 'cause I'm too good for all that
I wanna give this love back if I could (My love is so good)
You wish you could get this girl back
You miss me cause my love was so good

(My love is so good) So good, so good
So good, so good
So good, so good
So good, so good
So good, so good
Now you're begging me to come home
But I'm already over you, baby
I bet you're all torn up
As soon as I'm long gone
You want me and you miss me like crazy
But, you're all out of luck

(My love is so good) So good, so good
