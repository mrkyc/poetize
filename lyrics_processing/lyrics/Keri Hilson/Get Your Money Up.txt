Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's get 'em, Keri
Stop, now let me see your booty drop

If you think you impressin' us with your ice and your dub
Poppin' bottles in the club, get your money up (Uh-huh)
'Cause I ain't your average girl, I've been all around the world
With your boy, wanna wow me?
Then get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
I wanna see something bigger than a Hummer truck
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You gotta throw something bigger than a hundred bucks

Now slide, slide one of them black cards
If you got it, then show me how you're gettin' it
Diamonds are girl's best friend, if you can provide them
I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it
When you see me in my thang, blow a whole lot of change
If the bar don't get jealous, get your money up
And if you don't like us, ain't nothing to discuss
We don't even give a fuck, get your money up

If you're tearin' the bar down with all the fly women
And still livin' with your momma
Get your money up
If you ridin' big whips, can't take care of your kids
Why you lookin' at me?
Get your money up
When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll
Them bottles pop, nonstop
You up in Hollywood, you know how we roll, stop!
Now let me see your booty drop

Cash is what I'm talkin' about, I don't wanna hear your mouth
You needa put some money down, or get your money up
Why you invadin' my space? Why you get up in my face?
I ain't got nothing to say, but get your money up
Get your money up, boy
Get your money up
You know I wanna see something better than the autobus
Get your money up, boy

You know my bottle cost more than a hundred bucks

Okay now, slide, slide one of them black cards
If you got it then show me how you're getting it
Diamonds are girl's best friend, if you can provide them
I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it
Now grind, grind
Get you some big money and don't forget about me when you're spendin' it
But if you ain't gon' pay, don't be screamin' out, "Hey girl"
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)

Now slide, slide one of them black cards
Make the pacific ocean be a part of my backyard
If you ain't gon' pay, don't be screamin' out, "Hey"
I'm an independent honey, I get money all day
Now slide to your bank account, all the cash, throw it out
If you ain't yellin' dollars and diamonds, I gotta walk it out
Know what I'm talkin about? You steppin' to the baddest
Got millionaires standin' in line wishin' they had this
Take me to Paris, buy 100 carats, Christian Louboutin boots
Bags and more carats
You want average? Well, this the wrong section
My girls need the check so we headed in that direction
Get your money up
Get your money up
(Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up)
Get your money up (Get your money up)
Get your money up (Get your money up)
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)

Oh!
