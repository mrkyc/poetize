Moonshine
Rum, whiskey, and rye
We give the top and tail to the mountain trail
But we pour that hard in a jar, let's write some moonshine
Little bottle of good time
Burns like hell but it tastes like heaven

Get those bottles on the road young man
Oh I am a bootlegger
With a trunk load full of moonshine
And my daddy tried to quell my crimes
But I just couldn't let it go
My heart was set on money
And the open road in the moonlight
Sooner or later I been meeting then, but till then

Moonshine
Rum, whiskey, and rye
We give the top and tail to the mountain trail
Pour that hard in a jar, let's write some moonshine
It's a little bottle of good time
Burns like hell but it tastes like heaven
You might also like
I found myself a lover
She swore she'd never leave me
I found it hard to believe it
But it turned out to be the truth
But my heart was full of trouble
And it always gathered 'round me
Sooner or later we were meeting then, but till then

Moonshine
Rum, whiskey, and rye
We give the top and tail to the mountain trail
Pour that hard in a jar, let's write some moonshine
A little bottle of good time
Burns like hell but it tastes like heaven

I got my blood till the water boils
Chasing the horizon
Before the sun starts rising
Can I have the moonshine getting low?
And I brewed us up a batch boy
Get your howl at the moonlight
Four till the morning, better hold on tight
Sleep all day cause we live by night
Moonshine
Rum, whiskey, and rye
We give the top and tail to the mountain trail
Pour that hard in a jar, let's write some moonshine
It's a little bottle of good time
