We fell out by the side of the road
I came in like a Roman attack or a train off the track
You were taken aback
I was there for sharing the load
I was there for taking the slack when your spirit was lacking
And your soul was feeling shackled up

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I was there to help the story unfold
But I ended up a thorn in your side with my prickling pride
And inarticulate drive
All you wanted was a glimmer of hope
And I exploded like a splitting of Adams
Even Eve couldn't fathom how we shrugged it off as happenstance

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

It's hard to see it now, but I remember once upon a time
There was a world, then there was you and I
Never dreamed we could be anything less than alright
Until the night when I tried to pick a fight
No apology could ever make it be alright
But we're still alive, and I still apologize
All you ever really wanted to see in my eyes
Was a little life to illuminate and empathize
You might also like
I was shouting in the street I recall
You were armadillo in full effect, simply trying to protect
All the space that he left
You said, "Didn't you hear about the call?
You're bombarding me with previous lovers and then devious brothers
Like everything means nothing at all"

It's hard to see it now, but I remember once upon a time
There was a world, then there was you and I
Never dreamed we could be anything less than alright
Until the night when I tried to pick a fight
No apology could ever make it be alright
But we're still alive, and I still apologize
All you ever really wanted to see in my eyes
Was a little life to illuminate and empathize

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

It's hard to see it now, but I remember once upon a time
There was a world, then there was you and I
Never dreamed we could be anything less than alright
Until the night when I tried to pick a fight
No apology could ever make it be alright
But we're still alive, and I still apologize
All you ever really wanted to see in my eyes
Was a little life to illuminate and empathize
