Her hair was copper and her beauty bold
It warmed me to my soul
Her eyes were green, brown, orange, and gold
And her lips, like cherry cola
Man, the way she looked that night
Made my heart skip a beat
The way she laid everything on the line
And said, "Baby, what's it gonna be?" nah

Do you wanna be with me (Be with me, baby)
Or do you wanna bum around this town? (Be with me, baby)
Do you wanna be with me, baby (Be with me, baby)
Or do you wanna bum around this town
With your golden brown?
Do you wanna be with me (Be with me, baby)
Or do you wanna bum around this town? (Be with me, baby)
Do you wanna be with me baby? (Be with me, baby)
Hoo hoo hoo

I just smiled and I held her eye
And I tried to play it cool
I said, "Babe, I ain't gonna lie
You know you caught me on the back foot"
I know that we've both been playing
You as much as me
And the only question to remain
As far as I can see is
You might also like
Do you wanna be with me
Or do you wanna bum around this town? (With me baby)
Do you wanna be with me baby (With me baby)
Or do you wanna bum around this town?
Drinking till you drown
Do you wanna be with me baby (With me baby)
Or do you wanna bum around this town? (With me baby)
Do you wanna be with me baby? (With me baby)
Ooh hoo

Be with me baby
Be with me baby
Be with me baby
Be with me baby
Be with me baby

Do you wanna be with me? Ah
Do you wanna be with me? Yeah, yeah
Do you wanna be with me? Ooh hoo hoo hoo
Do you wanna be with me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do you wanna be with me? Yeah
Do you wanna be with me? Yeah
Do you wanna be with me? Yeah
Do you wanna be with me?
