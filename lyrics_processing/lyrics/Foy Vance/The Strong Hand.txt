January and the air is cold
It's been a while since I heard my mother's tone
Yet I know when I need her most
She lends me her shoulder
Carries my grief like hidden sin
Even through the times I wouldn't let her in
Now I'll never make the same mistake ever again

Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Of a kind-hearted mother to make a weak man
Dig down deep and find the strength from somewhere
To withstand more than he can without her care

Lately I've been calling home
Speaking to my brothers on the phone
And we laugh as we're looking back
Over our shoulder
Laughing 'bout games that we played to win
And how we wouldn't let each other in
How we'll never make the same mistakes
Ever again

Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Of a kind-hearted brother to make the weak man
Dig down deep and find the strength from somewhere
To withstand more than he can without his care

It's hard to think there was a time when I believed I
Would never see a future
Now I can't see anything clearer

So tonight I'm coming home
Can't bear to think of you lying there alone
Stroke your hair and I'll kiss your back
Then right up over your shoulder
Dive into your world like it's gonna end
Like I may never get the chance again
Everybody needs somebody on whom they can depend

Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Of a kind-hearted woman to make a weak man
Dig down deep and find the strength from somewhere
To withstand more than he can without her care

Sometimes it takes a little planning
And whole lotta understanding to make a weak man
Dig down deep and find the strength from somewhere
To withstand more than he can without her care
Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Of a kind-hearted mother
Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Of a kind-hearted brother
Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Of a kind-hearted woman
Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Sometimes it takes a strong hand
Sometimes it takes a strong hand
