Dropped her luggage bags, looked the concierge in the eye
Said "I need a room for the night
But I don't got no money, would you take payment in kind?"
He said "It's alright I got a room here, you can share mine
Make the bed in the morning, that'll do fine
You can change in the bathroom, hang your clothes on the line"
A tear came to her eye, she thought "How could he be so kind?"
How could he be so kind?
How could he be so kind?
She sat down on the bed with a needle
And he said, "I'd hate to see you bleed
I'll just fetch a warm towel then sit here 'til you're dry"
She started to cry, saying "Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?"
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
She was cold turkey, he was holding her hand
And she said, "I was ruined by a man and this was never in my plans
I dreamed of men who loved me, together we'd see the world
Somehow I lost myself among the insults they hurled"
You might also like"I'm sure you're a wonderful woman
And some day there will surely be someone
So just relax, it's important that you're calm"
She said, "How is it you can see past me as I am?"
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
"See, when you took your chances, it was like you placed a bet
And sometimes this is the reward you can get
I was always told, if you see someone defiled
You should look them in the eye and smile
Take their hand or better still take them home
Home
Home
She awoke early in the morning
Made the bed, gathered up her clothes to leave
Saw the concierge curled on the settee
Said "What you did for me is hard for me to believe"
"I was just doing what was right
Nobody that knows love could leave you out there on such a night
If you can help someone, bear this in mind
And consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness"
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
Consider it an indiscriminate act of kindness
