Every dream has a heartbeat
(Listen to it, listen to it)
And it won't let you sleep
(It's whispering, whispering)
You wake and it's in your breath
It's everything, everything

You know it's meant to be
And it's gonna set you free

There's a light in your eyes and it's magic
Everybody's gonna see that you have it
There's a voice saying gonna make it happen
Can't stop it, can't stop it
Go girl, no never give up
I know, know everything that you touch
Becomes alive right before your eyes
You were born  to shine
(Born to sing, born to try, born to dance, born to rise, born to be who you are, born to love)
You were born to shine

Like the sun you will always be
Rising, rising
When something looks out of reach
You keep trying, trying
You gotta a spirit inside of you
It ain't dying, dying
You might also like
It goes on and on
Keeps you strong, when you're like the sun

There's a light in your eyes and it's magic
Everybody's gonna see that you have it
There's a voice saying gonna make it happen
Can't stop it, can't stop it
Go girl, no never give up
I know, know everything that you touch
Becomes alive right before your eyes
You were born  to shine
(Born to sing, born to try, born to dance, born to rise, born to be who you are, born to love)

Born to run
Born to fly
Born to be more than alive
Find your voice
Find your life
Find that you born to shine

There's a light in your eyes and it's magic
Everybody's gonna see that you have it
There's a voice saying gonna make it happen
Can't stop it, can't stop it
Go girl, no never give up
I know, know everything that you touch
Becomes alive right before your eyes
You were born  to shine
(Born to sing, born to try, born to dance, born to rise, born to be who you are, born to love)
You were born to shine
(Born to sing, born to try, born to dance, born to rise, born to be who you are, born to love)
