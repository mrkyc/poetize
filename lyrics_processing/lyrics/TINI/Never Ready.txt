Right now, right now
No time to waste 'cause it's a moment
And we both know it, yeah
This rush is just
Because I wanna know you better
Might be forever

How 'bout right now we play pretend
Act like this won't end in a life like this, eh
Where everything changes too fast
Memories can't last, not forgetting this, yeah

I'm not ready to leave you, I'm never ready
Let's go another night, (-nother night, -nother night)
I'm not ready to leave you, I'm never ready
I need you in my life (-nother night, -nother night)

I'm never ready (-nother night, -nother night)
I'm never ready (-nother night, -nother night)

Come close, real close
So we can keep this moment going (eh)
That's all I'm hoping, mmh
Stay here with me
I feel like this is something special
Your eyes are special, mmh
You might also like
How 'bout right now we play pretend
Act like this won't end in a life like this, eh
Where everything changes too fast
Memories can't last, not forgetting this, yeah

I'm not ready to leave you, I'm never ready
Let's go another night (-nother night, -nother night)
I'm not ready to leave you, I'm never ready
I need you in my life (-nother night, -nother night)

I'm never ready (-nother night, -nother night)
I'm never ready (-nother night, -nother night)

I missed you before I missed you, missed you
I missed you before I missed you, missed you
I missed you even when I'm still with you, I tell you
I missed you before I missed you, missed you (oh, oh)

I'm not ready to leave you, I'm never ready
Let's go another night (-nother night, -nother night)
I'm not ready to leave you, I'm never ready
I need you in my life (-nother night, -nother night)
I'm never ready (-nother night, -nother night) (ready, ready)
I'm never ready (-nother night, -nother night) (ready, ready, oh-oh)
I'm never ready (-nother night, -nother night) (ready, ready)
I'm never ready
