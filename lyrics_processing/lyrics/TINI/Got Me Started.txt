I remember what you said
I can't get you out my head
Every night's a crazy party
I don't wanna wake up from it

I feel you like a hurricane
A perfect song inside my brain
You should hear the things you say
(You should hear the)
Every word makes me insane
(Every word makes me insane)

We can't stop, once we get started
Baby, you got me started
Even though you're so far away
I'm feeling you on my body
We can't stop, once we get started
Baby, you got me started
Even though you're so far away
I'm feeling you on my body

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Once we get started
(Oh
Once we get started
Oh, oh
Once we get started)
You might also like
I could fix your lonely pain
Close your eyes and think of me
I could be your ecstasy (i can be your)
Magic power in your veins

We can't stop, once we get started
Baby, you got me started
Even though you're so far away
I'm feeling you on my body
We can't stop, once we get started
Baby, you got me started
Even though you're so far away
I'm feeling you on my body
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
(Once we get started)

Somewhere where we more than just a fantasy
There'll be no more hide and seek
And if you want me I'm only a blink away
Close your eyes and look for me
'Cause your love
Is keepin' me close
Your love
Is keepin' me up
Your love
Is keepin' me going
Your love
Is keepin' me high
Somewhere where we more than just a fantasy
Close your eyes and look for me
Oh, yeah
Oh
Oh

We can't stop, once we get started
Baby, you got me started
Even though you're so far away
I'm feeling you on my body
We can't stop, once we get started
Baby, you got me started
Even though you're so far away
I'm feeling you on my body
We can't stop, once we get started
Baby, you got me started
Even though you're so far away
I'm feeling you on my body
We can't stop, once we get started
