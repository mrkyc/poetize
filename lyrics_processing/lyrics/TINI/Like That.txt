Are we, are we, are we playing games?
Never, ever, ever, ever thought that we were more than friends
Baby, are we more than friends?
I know we always, always fool around
Never really, really, really wanted to get complicated
But feelings are changing

Say, say, say you want me
'Cause waiting is gonna make me crazy
If this goes down, don't blame me
Na-na, don't blame me
Say, say, say, the right things
And maybe I can stop pretending
Na-na-na, don't blame me

'Cause if you love me like that
If you touch me like that
Move my body like that, oh
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you right back
If you touch me like that
Make a good girl go bad, mmh
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you

Why, why, why, why, why
Are you making me believe
That there's more to you and me?
Why, why, why, why, why
Is it getting hard to breathe
When you're getting close to me?

'Cause if you love me like that
If you touch me like that
Move my body like that, oh
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you right back
If you touch me like that
Make a good girl go bad, mmh
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you right back

Right back, right back, mmh
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you right back
Right back, right back, mmh
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you

Say, say, say you want me
'Cause waiting is gonna make me crazy
If this goes down, don't blame me
Na-na, don't blame me
Say, say, say, the right things
And maybe I can stop pretending
Na-na-na, don't blame me
'Cause if you love me like that
If you touch me like that (oh, woah)
Move my body like that, oh (like that, yeah)
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you (baby)
Right back (like that)
If you touch me like that (like that)
Make a good girl go bad, mmh (like eh, eh)
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you right back

Right back, right back, mmh
Imma love you, love you, love you, love you right back
Like that, right back
Like that, right back, mmh (like eh, eh)
