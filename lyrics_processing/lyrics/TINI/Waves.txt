You're the life of the party
Glad you got me alone
If I'm too honest, I'm sorry
I've never felt this before
Let's forget what the rules say
I know we met on the floor
If I could bet all my money
I bet that this could be lo-o-ove

Don't stop
Play me that song that will make my heart drop
Tick-tock, I'm losing track of my mind

Feel the waves of my body
I know you love to ride them down, down, down, down, down
Feel the waves of my body
Come on now, baby, ride them down, down, down, down
Take it to your knees, take it to your knees
Keep your hands on me, we could take it deep, eh
Come ride the waves of my body

Ride them down, down, down, down, down
Ride them down, down, down, down, down
Ride them down, down, down, down, down

The floor is force is forceless
Leaving me no choices, choices, choiceless
I'm not diving him over my head
And I feel the waves pushing to my bed, yea-eah
I love the way you move like you're a part of me (I do, I do)
Love the way I move like I'm a part of you (I do, I do)

Don't stop
Play me that song that will make my heart drop
Tick-tock, I'm losing track of my mind

Feel the waves of my body
I know you love to ride them down, down, down, down, down
Feel the waves of my body
Come on now, baby, ride them down, down, down, down
Take it to your knees, take it to your knees
Keep your hands on me, we could take it deep, eh
Come ride the waves of my body

Ride them down, down, down, down, down
Ride them down, down, down, down, down
Ride them down, down, down, down, down
Don't stop
Play me that song that will make my heart drop (oh)
Tick-tock, I'm losing track of my mind

Feel the waves of my body
I know you love to ride them down, down, down, down, down
Feel the waves of my body
Come on now, baby, ride them down, down, down, down
Take it to your knees, take it to your knees
Keep your hands on me we could take it deep, eh
Come ride the waves of my body

Ride them down, down, down, down, down
Ride them down, down, down, down, down
