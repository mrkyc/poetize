Wait before you treat me like a stepchild
Let me tell you why they got me on file
'Cause I give you what you lack
Come right and exact
Our status is the saddest
So I care where you at, black
And at home
I got a call from Tony Rome
The FBI was tapping my telephone
I never live alone
I never walk alone
My posse's always ready
And they're waiting in my zone
Although I live the life
That of a resident
But I be knowing the scheme
That of the president tapping my phone
Whose crew's abused
I stand accused of doing harm
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on
I'm louder than a bomb
Come on
You might also likeI am
The rock hard trooper
To the bone, the bone, the bone
Full grown, consider me stone
Once again and I say it for you to know
The troop is always ready
I yell Geronimo
You're CIA
You see, I ain't kidding
Both King and X, they got rid of both
A story untold, true, but unknown
Professor Griff knows
I ain't milk toast
Of those with closed minds
Don't know I'm rapid
The way that I rap it
Is making 'em tap it, yeah
Never serving 'em well
'Cause I'm an Un-Tom
It's no secret at all
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on
I'm louder that a bomb
Come on
Cold holding the load
The burden breaking the mold
I ain't lying, denying
'Cause they're checking my code
Am I bugging 'cause they're bugging
My phone for information
No telling who's selling out
Building the nation
Join the set, the point black target
Every brothers inside, so least not you forget
No, taking the blame is not a waste
Here taste a bit of the song
So you can never be wrong
Just a bit of advice
'Cause we be paying the price
'Cause every brother mans life
Is like swinging the dice, right?
Here it is, once again this is
The brother to brother
The terminator the cutter
Going on and on
Leave alone the grown
Get it straight in '88
And I'll troop in to demonstrate
The posse always ready, 98 and 98
My posse come quick
Because my posse got velocity
Tapping my phone
They never leave me alone
I'm even lethal when I'm unarmed
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on
'Cause I'm louder that a bomb
Come on
'Cause the 'D' is for dangerous
You can come and get some of this
I teach and speak
So when it's spoke it's no joke
The voice of choice
The place shakes with bass
Called one for the treble
The rhythm is a rebel
Here's a funky rhyme that they're tapping on
Just thinking I'm breaking the beats
I'm rapping on
CIA, FBI
All they tell us is lies
And when I say it they get alarmed
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
Come on
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
