My baby, don't rush me, I know it's coming
But let's not go crazy, you've got you're reasons
Reasons I know, you'll never be alone

My baby, don't rush me, I know it's coming
But let's not go crazy, you've got you're reasons
Reasons I know, you'll never be alone
You dance on the dance floor
You're locked in my sights
You hide in the crowd
And get lost in the lights
Now these feelings I'm feeling
They cut to the bone
Te ala te ala
You're good as gold
And now I know who's in control
And now I know who's in control
And now I know who's in control
And now I know who's in control
And now I know who's in control
And now I know who's in control
And now I know who's in control
And now I know who's in control
