And I'm not like you
And you're not like me
But I'm the same as you
And you're the same as me
And you're a lot like you
But you're a bit like me
And you're a bit like me
But you're a lot like you
And I'm not like you
And you're not like me
And you're a bit like me
But you're a lot like you
I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll listen
It's true you're a bit like me
But you're a lot like you
I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll listen
Lessons lately I learned
Now it's your turn
I think you've earned your freedom
Forgive me I was a fool
Might be older than you
But I certainly ain't no wiser
So come now, rest your head
Ease your mind
I'll fight for you for you instead
(2x)
