I'm tryin to learn to keep my mind in check
I listen to my friends when they say
It's destiny, its meant to be this way
I found that they're right and now I see
That all this time and I had the key
So now I'm on a roll, I got nothing but luck
With a spring in my step as I strut down the block
I see the boys stare and...
I see the boys stare and...
I see the boys stare and...
I hear them talk
Uh uh uh
As far as I go, and-a uh uh uh
As far as I know, and-a uh uh uh
I've always got, and-a uh uh uh
A place called home, and-a uh uh uh
I cross overseas, and-a uh uh uh
It's fine by me, and-a uh uh uh
'Cause I'll never be, and-a uh uh uh
Far from home
My heart takes a hit and then my heart hits back
And each day I find comfort in the fact
I listen to my friends when they say
Man, just relax 'cause it's all a game
I found they're right and now I see
I'm gonna have my fun, what will be will be
Now I'm on the street and I'm whistlin' this
Everything's in place 'cause I can't miss
I smile at my girls and...
I smile at my girls and...
I smile at my girls and...
I blow them a kiss

Hard not to be so hard on myself
