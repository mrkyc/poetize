A dirty city, living wild
Dinner guests you left beguiled
Why?
For the thrill of the chase
A country manor, knees soiled
Bodies bruised from endless toil
And I
Hungered for a taste
Waiting
Watching
Sir, sir, sir
Father knew who you
Were, were, were
Now you got me back training foxes
While you packed the world in boxes
And I am your summer home
Now I xxxx this xxxx alone
So take hold of these carriage reins
And drive me away
A dirty city, living wild
Dinner guests you left beguiled
Why?
For the thrill of the chase
You gave it up
A country manor, knees soiled
Bodies bruised from endless toil
And I
Hungered for a taste
I hunger
Waiting out
Watching
You were watching
Sir, sir, sir
Father knew who you
Were, were, were
Now you got me back training foxes
While you packed the world in boxes
And I am your summer home
Now I xxxx this xxxx alone
So take hold of these carriage reins
And drive me away
Sir, sir, sir
Father knew who you
Were, were, were
Now you got me back training foxes
While you packed the world in boxes
And I am your summer home
Now I xxxx this xxxx alone
So take hold of these carriage reins
