Flirtatious, tryin' to show faces
Lookin' for the right time to shoot my steam
Lookin' for the right time to flash them G's
I'm leavin', please believin'
Me an' the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the four seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve, no teasin'
I need you to get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for
Cause I feel like bustin' loose an' I feel like touchin' you
An' can't nobody stop the juice
So baby, tell me whats the use?
I say
It's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles?
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' sports cars, ain't hittin' the throttle
An' I be down an' do a hundred, top down an' goggles
You might also likeGet off the freeway, exit 106 an' parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out an' walked it
I spit game cause baby can't talk it
Warm, sweatin', it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, all on at this point
Your with a winner, so baby, you can't loose
I got secrets, can't leave Cancun
So take it off, like your home alone
You know, dance in front your mirror while your on the phone
Checkin' your reflection, tellin' your best friend
Like, "Girl, I think my butt gettin' big"
It's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Stop pacin', time wastin'
I gotta a friend with a pole' in the basement (What)
I'm just kiddin', like Jason (Oh)
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra, spread the news
Nelly took a trip from the Luna to Neptunes
Came back with somethin' thicker than fittin' in sasoons
Say she got a thing 'bout cuttin' in restrooms
Mix a little bit of ah, ah, with a little bit of ah, ah
Give a little bit of ah, ah, with a little bit of ah, ah
Mix a little bit of ah, ah, with a little bit of ah, ah
Sprinkle of that ah, ah, with a little bit of ah, ah
It's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes
It's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes
