I'm trying to learn to keep my mind in check
I listen to my friends
When they say
"It's destiny
It's meant to be this way"
I found that they're right
And now I see
That all this time
And I had the key
So now I'm on a roll
I got nothing but luck
With a spring in my step
As I strut down the block
I see the boys stare
And I hear them talk
As far as I go
As far as I know
I've always got
A place called home
I cross all the seas
It's fine by me
'Cause I'll never be
Far from home

And then my heart hits back
And each day I find
Comfort in the fact
I listen to my friends
When they say
"Man just relax, 'cause it's all a game"
I found they're right
And now I see
I'm gonna have my fun
And what will be will be
Now I'm walking up the street
Whistling this
Everything's in place
'Cause I can't miss
I smile at my girls
And blow 'em a kiss
As far as I go
As far as I know
I always got
A place called home
I cross all the seas
It's fine by me
'Cause I'll never be
Far from home
As far as I go
As far as I know
I always got
A place called home
I cross all the seas
It's fine by me
'Cause I'll never be
Far from home
Far from home
Far from home
Far from home
