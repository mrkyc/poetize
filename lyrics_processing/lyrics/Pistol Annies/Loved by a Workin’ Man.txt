He ain't much on roses but he'd walk a country mile
To pick a handful of white flowers that would make his baby smile
He won't do the dishes but he'll sweep you off your feet
And he'll make you feel like the prettiest thing that he's ever seen

'Cause he knows how to treat his woman
And he knows how to make ends meet
He'll take you for a ride in his four-wheel drive
And he'll fix about anything
He likes to get dirty but he cleans up good
He drinks with his buddies but he prays when he should
And there ain't nothing better than
Being loved by a workin' man

He don't write love letters but he loves to make things right
With a heart the size of Texas, two arms to hold you tight
He won't do the laundry but he'll keep your car real clean
And he'll make you feel like the prettiest thing that he's ever seen

'Cause he knows how to treat his woman
And he knows how to make ends meet
He'll take you for a ride in his four-wheel drive
And he'll fix about anything
He likes to get dirty but he cleans up good
He drinks with his buddies but he prays when he should
And there ain't nothing better than
Being loved by a workin' man
