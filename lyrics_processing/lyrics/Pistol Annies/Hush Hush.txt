My brother got out of rehab
Right around Christmas time
Mama made a turkey, Daddy was worried
He was gonna have to break up a fight
Everybody was walkin' on eggshells
Drinkin' eggnog instead of beer
We were holdin' our tongues, scratchin' our heads
Wonderin' how the hell we got here

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts?
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush

We were sittin' 'round the dinner table
And we were eatin' our pumpkin pie
While the sugar-coated purty little secret
Was eatin' everybody alive
Well, Daddy's readin' propaganda
And he's talkin' 'bout the end of days
Well, cheers to the vodka Mama's been sneakin'
Let's all gather 'round and pray
You might also like
Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts?
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush

So I snuck out behind the red barn
And I took myself a toke
Since everybody here hates everybody here
Hell, I might as well be the joke
I'm gonna dance up on the table
Singin' "This Little Light of Mine"
God gave it to me, what good's it gonna do me
If I don't, by God, let it shine?

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts?
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush

Hide your tattoo
Put on your Sunday best, pretend you're not a mess
Be the happy family in the front pew
Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, boy, you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush
Don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts?
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove
It's best to keep it hush, hush

What are the neighbors gonna think?
Better shut that mouth
Hush it, be quiet
