If I could put us in a snow globe
Ooh, then maybe we could let it go
And we could spin around in circles
In a world that's all our own
And we could shake it up
Shake it loose
A white Christmas all year through
If I could put us in a snow globe
Then we could let it go

We'll be kissing on the steps of the little white church
From January 1 to December 31st
We could cruise around in a little red Ford
Pick a pretty tree from the All Country store

If I could put us in a snow globe
Ooh, then maybe we could let it go
And we could spin around in circles
In a world that's all our own
And we could shake it up
Shake it loose
A white Christmas all year through
If I could put us in a snow globe
Then we could let it go
You might also like
We wouldn't have to wait around for the magic to finally happen
We'll live right here in Tinsel town, cuddled up by the fire and laughing

If I could put us in a snow globe
Ooh, then maybe we could let it go
And we could spin around in circles
In a world that's all our own
And we could shake it up
Shake it loose
A white Christmas all year through
If I could put us in a snow globe
Then we could let it go

If I could put us in a snow globe
Ooh, then maybe we could let it go
And we could spin around in circles
In a world that's all our own
And we could shake it up
Shake it loose
A white Christmas all year through
If I could put us in a snow globe
Then we could let it go
If I could put us in a snow globe
