Ridgecrest Apartments, movin' that white girl
Posted up on the corner, movin' that marijuana
Glock .40 on my hip, holl'in out "You don't want it!"
My Glock stay cocked, rocks in a match box
Head garlind' on lock - I'mma go getta!
A nigga raided ya spot, confiscated your block
And he didn't get shot - you'se a ho' nigga!
And I remember you, do you remember me?
8th grade leavin' school, rockin' up a quarter ki (That's wassup!)

Fish tail swervin' witcha bitch on the passenger, side
Shawty, let's ride (Whuddup!), rims still spinnin' so shawty let's glide (Whuddup!)
She askin' me why, I don't get, high

Wanna be me nigga - that's wassup (Yeh!)
'Bout ya dollar, pop ya collar then you holla - that's wassup (Yo Gott-Ayye!!)
See me shawty, say "Wassup!"
Wanna fuck me shawty, that's wassup (Yeh!)
That's wassup, that's wassup, th-that's wassup, that's wassup (INE!)
