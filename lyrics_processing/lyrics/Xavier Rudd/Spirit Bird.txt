Give it time and we wonder why
Do what we can laugh and we cry
And we sleep in your dust because
We've seen this all before
Culture fades with tears and grace
Leaving us stunned hollow with shame
We have seen this all, seen this all before
Many tribes of a modern kind doing brand new work same spirit by side
Joining hearts and hands and ancestral twine, ancestral twine
Many tribes of a modern kind doing brand new work same spirit by side
Joining hearts and hands and ancestral twine, ancestral twine

Slowly it fades
Slowly we fade
Slowly we fade
Slowly we fade

Spirit bird he creaks and groans
She knows she has seen this all before
She has seen this all before, she has
Spirit bird he creaks and groans
She knows she has seen this all before
She has seen this all before, she has

Soldier on, soldier on my good countrymen
Keep fighting for your culture now
Keep fighting for your land
I know it's been thousands of years
And I feel your hurt
And I know it's wrong and you feel you've been chained
And broken and burned
And those beautiful old people
Those wise old souls
Have been ground down for far too long
By that spineless man
That greedy man
That heartless man
Deceiving man, that government hand
Taking blood and land, taking blood and land
And still they can
But your dreaming and your warrior spirit lives on
And it is so so so strong
In the earth, in the trees, in the rocks
In the water, in your blood and in the air we breathe
Soldier on, soldier on my good countrymen
Keep fighting for your children now
Keep fighting for your land
Slowly we fade
Slowly it fades
Slowly it fades
Slowly we fade

Give it time and we wonder why
Do what we can, laugh and we cry
