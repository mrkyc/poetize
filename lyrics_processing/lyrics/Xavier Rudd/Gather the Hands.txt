She was delivered by the grace of his hands
Kindness, relentless quiet to be shared
People stood awkwardly and gazed across the room
She walked with such elegance in the places that she knew
Flawlessness, contagious, compassionate, engagement
In these hands, I belong
In these hands, you belong
Foolish, segregation scars deep beneath the skin
Of the black man and the white man and everyone in-between

Forever sacred was the feminine
Right down to the final hour
When every baby to be taken, to be poisoned to be soured
Bodies turning in their graves
And spirits waiting to go home
Disconnected from their holy places when the museums stole their bones
Cry freedom, still bleeding
Still waiting for a reason
Throw these arms around the world
Throw these arms around the world
Through the eye of a needle, we tried to move the stone
So heavy from its history, of shame and blood and bone

Gather the hands to move the stone
Gather the hands to move the stone
Sing it up to the heavens
Let it rain down on us all
