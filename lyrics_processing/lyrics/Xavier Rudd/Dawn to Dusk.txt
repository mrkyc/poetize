Tryna fan a fire that's been smoking since they came
Distant songs powdered bones deep
Inside the caves
Sentimental pieces the eye cannot locate
Tryna find some reason in the pain of it all
And time on time marches on
We're walking on broken glass and
Tryna get along with peace and every piece the centre of it all
Wounds as deep as canyons hands worked to the bone
Sacrifices undenied to get us to this point
Hand in hand we stumble on and listen to your songs
And breathe on we breathe with heavy hearts
I lay here awake thinking what you would say
You are always in my heart
Burning strong from the start
Now that you're gone your flame burns on
From dawn through to dark
Am I not my father living with this curse
Am I not my mother a veil over the hurt
You have shown me freedom king within my gates
You have shown me anguish for the things I couldn't change

But it's hard sometimes to let it all come loose
We are bound up so tight conditioned from the fight
Generations of wrongs became our truth
High above the mantle high above the shame
King parrot calls the one he loves
To keep her close and safe
Their pride it is their nature
From nature it was raised
The pride inside of all of us
Extinguished by hate
Please help me see your wisdom on my own when I am weak
When there's trouble on every side
When rain clouds fill my mind
When the words become so faded I cannot read
Help me to fly or help me to fall
Must I do it on my own all alone
Days I'm scared for my life
Days I cannot stop my mind
Days I know that I can see but I am blind
And when the rain finally falls and
I have no strength at all and I just wanna
Slip away and find your soul
Give me strength
