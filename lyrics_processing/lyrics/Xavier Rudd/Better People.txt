And giving your thanks to our seas
My respect to the ones in the forest
Standing up for our old trees
Them giving food to the hungry
Hope to the needy
Giving life to a baby
Giving care for free
Cause there is freedom around us
We have everything we need
And I will care for you
Cause you care for me
And we all have opinions
Some of them get through
But there's better people
With more good to do
Good to do
And what I have could be a message
Or just some words from my heart
My respect to the ones making changes
For other lives they'll give their own
Like giving food to the hungry
Giving hope to the needy
Giving life to a baby
Giving care for free
Cause there is freedom around us
We have everything we need
And I will care for you
Cause you care for me
And we all have opinions
Some of them get through
But there's better people
With more good to do
Good to Do

Human nature keeps spreading its disease
And our children keep growing up with what they know
From what we teach and what they see
And it's only a question of the time we have
And the lives that our children will lead
Cause they can only keep growing up with what they know
And what we teach, and what they see
Like giving food to the hungry
Giving hope to the needy
Giving life to a baby
Giving care for free
Cause there is freedom around us
We have everything we need
And I will care for you
Cause you care for me
We all have opinions
Some of them get through
But there's better people
With more good to do
