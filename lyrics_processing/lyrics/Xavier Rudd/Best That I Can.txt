If there's one little thing that I know is true
I'll do my best to take care of you
It's this crazy world that swallows us now
Baby smoking cigarettes
Buying tattoo guns on the internet
The President says science got it wrong
When people posting
The current mood
Disease multiplying from the shitty food
And pharmaceutical companies got it made
At the end of the day when I take your hand
Remind myself I'm the luckiest man
Breathe with you and gently drift away

And I'll take of you darling
Just like the sun takes care of rain
If trouble strikes without warning
I'll do the best that I can

And every now and then
As my hunger slips away
I'm humbled that I get to choose everything that's on my plate
Empathy for the Sudanese, so far from their home
Had to drink their urine to reach Ethiopia
Never know the demons that chase a child soldier
We'll never know the pain with him, Emanuel Jo
Sent to tell his story
Through wise, tormented eyes
He was sent to share his magic, in these crazy troubled times

And I'll take of you darling
Just like the sun takes care of rain
If trouble strikes without warning
I'll do the best that I can
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll do the best that I can
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll do the best that I can

Holy, holy, Mother Theresa
Working her fingers to the bone in the slums of Kolkata
Some are sipping fine wine, planning out their wars
How to bomb entire nations
Get control of the oil
Memories and photographs platforms in my mind
Mandatory loneliness before you were by my side
Remember dad once telling me of the very first TV
Stephen Hawking said we'll all be gone by 21-17

And I'll take of you darling
Just like the sun takes care of rain
If trouble strikes without warning
I'll do the best that I can
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'll do the best that I can
Oh-oh, oh-oh
