He told me yes he can forgive, but he can never forget it
Weapons always close to hand, for he has seen too much hatred
Only weapon that he chooses is love, universal call now for justice
And I'll keep keep on waving this flag, cover my head, cover my back now 
And I'll keep keep on waving this flag, cover your head, cover your back now
People keep on waving this flag, cover your head, cover your back now
You know, you know, I said praise Jandamarra and the Bunuba tribe
Building the resistance with strength and pride
Said no to domination of the ancient clans
Protection of his people and his tribal lands
Healing in the tunnel at his mothers right hand
Healing in the tunnel with the spirit of the land
Precedent set for the present day
Time to stand time to keep waving that flag
Cover my head, cover my back now
And I'll keep keep on waving this flag, cover my head, cover my back now
People keep on waving this flag and I'll cover your head, and I'll cover your back now
People keep on waving this flag, cover my head, cover my back now
Said people keep on waving this flag
(keep waving, keep on waving that flag)
People keep on waving this flag, cover my back now
(keep waving, keep on waving that flag)
