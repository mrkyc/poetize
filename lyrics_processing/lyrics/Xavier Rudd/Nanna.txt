Breathe of wind through the souls
Of my feet into my ? you go
Meditation of an ancient kind
Exhaling through my third eye
Stand strong in what I know
Stand aside from the evil
As the day turns into night
Through the breeze I hear you cry
And I believe in you
I believe in you
I will pray for you
I will pray for you

I believe in you
(Traditional Indigenous language)
I believe in you (I believe in you)
I believe in you (I believe in you)
And I will pray for you (I will pray you)
Oh my

Your rivers flow ?
Down the serpent's line ?
In these hands I hold your line
Through these hands I'll guide, I'll guide
You fuel me from the ground
Pulled me up when I was down
I believe in you
I believe in you
