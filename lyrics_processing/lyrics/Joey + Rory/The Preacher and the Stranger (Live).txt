The preacher told the stranger at the door
Come sit down by this fire, let the coffee warm you up
I can't say I've seen it rain this hard before."
The stranger said "
I saw your sign as I was walking down the road and I figured that a church might be the safest place to go."
Well son, crosses sure get heavy and we've all got one to bear
And if you're looking for a shelter from the storm, you'll find one here."
They sat and talked for hours there in that empty church, about how life's unfair sometimes, trying to make sense of how God works
The preacher said, "
I lost my son one summer and he was only 25
A drunk driver crossed that double yellow line
I prayed so hard to Jesus to save my only son, it seems all I do these days is question why?
Now I stand here every Sunday and preach to everybody else
I talk a lot about forgiveness, but I can't do it myself."
Well son, crosses sure get heavy and we've all got one to bear
I don't know why I'm telling you all this, or if you even care"
They sat and talked for hours there in that empty church, about how life's unfair sometimes, trying to make sense of how God works
Tears filled the strangers eyes, he said "
I know I've changed a lot
I might be hard for you to recognise
Late one summer night, I'd had too much to drink, I got behind the wheel and changed both of our lives
And I'm sorry just ain't good enough when you hurt someone like that
And if I could God knows I'd give my life to bring him back."

And I'm here to ask forgiveness, if you even care."
