We've been marching ten days and we're just outside Hopkinsville
It's been snowing all night and we ain't got no more kerosene
It's colder than hell, hope you're doing well, Josephine
There's a fever in camp and our boys are too sick to fight
We done lost old Calvin, Weaver won't make it through the night
I overheard heard the captain say it's the worst he's ever seen
I'm losing some weight but I'm still standing up straight, Josephine
Tell my children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more
Bet they've grown a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door
Tell mama and daddy I'm alright and just more thing
I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine
There's three thousand union troops camped at the river below
There's six hundred of us, 'least there was two nights ago
Will Erwin deserted and they hung him down by the stream
God, I'm so scared, keep me in your prayers, Josephine
Well, the orders come down, we attack tonight at nightfall
If we can stop them right here we can win this war once and for all
You know, I killed a union boy last week, bet he wasn't fourteen
He looked just like our son, forgive me for what I've done, Josephine
Tell my children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more
Bet they've grown a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door
Tell mama and daddy I'm alright and just one more thing
I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine
You might also likeAnd lastly, my darling, in case I should be killed
Don't grieve me too long and promise me that you will
Marry another and don't let him treat our babies mean
When he's holding you, would you think of me too, Josephine?
Tell my babies I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more
Bet they've grown a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door
Tell mama and daddy I'm alright and just one more thing
I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine
