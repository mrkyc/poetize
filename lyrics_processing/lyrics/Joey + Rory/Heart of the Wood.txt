I'd love the time we spent and I'd go everywhere he went
We'd end up on some old deer trail
And I'd listen hard as he would spin his tales
We were in a field of stumps he said I got a new one for you hon
These trees once stood tall and I'm the man that made them fall
I cut 'em up, sanded them down
And you wouldn't believe what I found
Past the bark and all the scars
Our home was in the heart of those old trees
God bless who sowed those seeds
A hundred years and they just grew
And only heaven knew what they'd be, to our family
All that time to become what they should
You know Our home was in the heart of the wood
He smiled, said there's my favorite one, pointed at a cherry stump
He said I couldn't afford the one at Sears so the good lord planted one right here
He carved out what he saw within and he gave it to my dad when he turned ten
Past the bark and all the scars
There was a guitar in the heart of that old tree
All from just one seed
A hundred years and it just grew
And only heaven knew just what it'd be
And how that tree could sing
All the time to become what it should
There were songs in the heart of the wood
You might also likeHe said we can mark a tree to keep from getting lost
And it'll always point our way home like that old rugged cross
A hundred years and it just grew and only heaven knew what it'd be
And who'd hang on that tree it held the Son of God like it should
But I know it broke the heart of the wood
I think what made granddaddy great was that he didn't work all day
I'd love the time we spent
