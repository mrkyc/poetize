And you went to work today, this song's for you
And if you put eight honest hours in
For eight hours worth of pay, this song's for you
And if it's taking all you got these days
Just to make ends meet
You'd like to give a piece of your mind
To those fat cats on Wall Street, this song's for you
If you go to church on Sunday
And you try to do what's right, this song's for you
If you've been known to drink a beer
And raise hell on a Friday night, this song's for you
If you wish we didn't have to go
And send our boys to war
But you still think this country of ours
Is sure worth dying for
This song's for you, you know who you are
We're up on this stage but you're the star
You're why we do what we do
We want you to know, this song's for you
Now if you love country music
As real as it comes, this song's for you
And if you came here tonight
Hoping you might hear you some, this song's for you
You might also likeIf you paid your hard earned money
To that bouncer at the door
To hear the kind of songs
That you don't get to hear much anymore
This song's for you, you know who you are
We're up on this stage but you're the star
You're why we do what we do
We want you to know, this song's for you
You might've lost a friend, a job
Or someone broke your heart
But just like you might need it to
The healing's in the tune
This song's for you, you know who you are
We're up on this stage but you're the star
You're why we do what we do
We want you to know, this song's for you
You deserve so much more, it's true
