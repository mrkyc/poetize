That the moon would never shine again
If there was ever the slightest doubt
That tomorrow the sun
Would somehow not come out
If such a thing could possibly come true
It wouldn't matter to me
Because I love you
More than the moon
More than the sun
More than the stars
If for some reason
All the seasons should fade away
Or what if suddenly we discovered
That the world's not round at all it's flat
Tomorrow such a thing could possibly be
But nothing could mean
As much as you do to me
'Cause I love you more
More than the moon
More than the sun
More than the stars
You might also likeThey could take the blue from the ocean
Toss the mountains into the sea
Chase the colors out of the rainbow's end
But it wouldn't bother me
'Cause they never could ever compare
To the natural high
That I get when you smile
When we touch
Oh, I love you so much, oh
If there was ever, never a chance
That we should meet again
Or if you had a change of heart
And decided that you and I should have to part
If such a thing would ever come to pass
Let the record show that I did my best
I loved you more
More than the spring
Summer, winter, or fall
Seasons will change
But you don't at all
I love you just the way you are
More than the stars
More than the stars
If for some reason
Seasons should fade away
Or what if suddenly we discovered
That the world's not round at all it's flat
Tomorrow such a thing could possibly be
But nothing could mean
As much as you do to me
I love you more
More than the spring
Summer, winter or fall
Seasons will change
But you don't at all
I love you just the way you are
Much more than the stars
More, more, more, more, more
More than the stars
I love you
