Your love, like wine, tasting sweeter to me every day
Your kiss, divine, and it melts the cold inside away
All of (All of) my life (My life), I've been waiting for a love like this
And now (Now), that you're here romance is just a second away
It's gonna stay

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over
'Til the Mojave red turns into blue
When my lungs get tired of breathing, and my heart stops its beating
Then I'll stop loving you

And in (And in) the dark (The dark)
When there's no one calling out your name
Well, I'll hold (I'll hold) you so tight
And I'll whisper to you once again, and again

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara, 'til the sun freezes over
When the Mojave red turns into blue
When the music's no longer playing, and the faithless start praying
I'll stop loving you
When the snow falls on the Sahara (Uh-huh) and the sun freezes over
When the Mojave red turns into blue (That's a long Time)
When my lungs get tired of breathing (Oh), and my heart stops its beating
I'll stop loving you
You might also like
I don't wanna miss a single heartbeat
Sometimes my words get in the way
But I hear your love just fine
Just fine
And it's gonna take a long time

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over
When the Mojave red turns into blue (That's a long time)
When the music's no longer playing, and the faithless start praying
I'll stop loving you, oh
When the snow falls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over
When the Mojave red turns into blue (I'll be loving you, baby)
When my lungs get tired of breathing, and my heart stops its beating
