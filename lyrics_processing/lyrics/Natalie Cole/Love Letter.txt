One, two, three, ow
Come on, y'all

Sittin' in front of your house
A-rainin' early dawn
I'm workin' on a love letter
I got my radio on
I got my eye on your window pane
Oh, I smoked a lot of cigarettes
Oh, mercy, mercy but love is strange
And you haven't even kissed me yet

Look comes to push
Push come to shove
Shove comes to touch
Touch will come to love

Working on a love letter
Listening to a love song
Oh, I'm writing you a love letter
I got my radio on
You might also like
I hope you get the message, baby
I know you'll let me in
'Cause it's real in your neighborhood
And this is more than I'm gonna bend

Listen, love don't sit around waitin'
Love, it don't behave
Love's waitin' in the car
Out in the pourin' rain

Working on a love letter (Oh, I'm working)
Listening to a love song (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm writing you a love letter (Baby, baby, baby)
With my radio on (I got my radio on)

Workin', ooh
Writin', ooh
Listenin', mmm-mmm
Lovin', mhm

(Well) Working on a love letter (Oh yeah, oh)
Listening to a love song (Oh yeah)
I'm writing you a love letter (Writing you a love letter, yeah)
With my radio on (I got my radio on)
Working on a love letter (Said I've got my eye on you, baby)
Listenin' to a love song (I've smoked too many cigarettes, oh)
I'm writing you a love letter (Mercy, mercy, hoo, hoo)
With my radio on (Oh, somebody turn up the radio)
All y'all could go on all night long if you want to
It's alright with me
Hey, woo, huh, yeah, oh, now roll with it
Oh, oh, now do it to it
Hey, yeah
Come on, y'all, let's go home
Oh, well, well, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
