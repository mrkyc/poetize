Oh, fellows you're cool, but, girls
If you've got a good man, you'd better keep him
Oh, I know you're saying right now, "What does she know?
Who is she to tell me about my situation?"
Well, I don't know your situation
But whatever it is, you should try to stay together
You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember?
Well, today it's not nothing
Just don't let him leave you, honey
'Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about him
It was the real small things
Go on and laugh but it's true
You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house
But never paid any attention to
Like helping with the groceries and
Helping in the yard and
Painting and repairing and
Huh, paying the bills
But you know now
All I have is memories and regrets
I could have given our love a chance to grow but no
I had to challenge it and be heard
Let me tell you something
That female liberation stuff
I don't know, sometimes
I don't think it's worth it
And I'm really feeling
You might also likeFeeling kind of bad y'all
I'm catching hell living here alone
Hmm, I never realized, oh, Lord
That you mean so much to me
I'm catching hell living here alone
I want you to come back, baby
Come back 'cause here's where you belong, oh, yeah
If I could replay, if I could replay
That whole scene again, oh well
You know that I would never, never say it again
That our love, our love is at its end
And oh, you know that I would kind of ease on back, yes I would
And let confusion pass on by
I took a fool's way out, oh, yeah
Without one good reason why
I'm catching hell, I'm catching hell
Lord, I'm living, living, living here alone, alone, lone
I didn't believe it could be
You know all the pressure on me
All the time, oh
I'm catching hell, well, well
Living here alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone
To tell you the truth, to tell you the truth
I'm going out of my mind, yeah
Oh, do you hear me tonight?
I don't have too much more to say except (This is my story)
Somebody told me that if you've got something that's good to you (Hey, this is my song)
And you don't use it you might lose it (Sad, sad, sad, song, song, so sad)
So girls, hold on to your good thing (Oh, you gotta hold on a little bit now)
And don't let go
Oh, do you hear me tonight?
It's so sad living alone, living alone (Hmm)
Hold on to your good thing, hold on (Well, well), oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Lordy, Lordy do you know what it's like?
Catching hell (Somebody turn up the microphone, oh)
