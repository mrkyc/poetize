Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh yeah

Baby, what's your hurry?
Where are you goin' so fast?
You can keep your motor runnin'
But don't run out of gas

Getting there's half the fun
'Cause you've got the rest of the night to hold me
And the best of my love's yet to come (Yet to come)
For the rest of my life I'm gonna love you
So take a little longer, my love can only get stronger
(Stronger, stronger)

If we're gonna climb a mountain
We gotta take our sweet time
When you're traveling down love's highway
Don't you know speeding is a crime?

Listen, getting there's half the fun
'Cause you've got the rest of the night to hold me
And the best of my love's yet to come (Yet to come)
For the rest of my life I'm gonna love you
So take a little longer, my love can only get stronger
(Stronger, stronger)
You might also like
Oh, my baby, we gotta slow down
Take your time, ease your mind
Ah baby, mmm, mmm
So stronger, rest of my life, I'm gonna love you
So just take a little longer and our love is gonna get stronger

'Cause you've got the rest of the night, oh yeah
And the best of my love yet to come (Yet to come)
Oh baby, for rest of my life, I'm gonna love you
I want you to take your time
Love me, baby, love me, baby, love me, love me
(Rest of the night)

Slow down, baby, I ain't goin' nowhere (Best of my love)
So why don't we just take our sweet time (Rest of my life)
Don't rush me, you're gonna crush me, let the fever climb
Oh, remember that song about a slow hand (Rest of my life)
Now she had the right idea
So, baby, what's the hurry? (Best of my love)
We've got forever if we don't use it up too fast
Take it slow, calm down, smell the roses
We'll get there, don't you worry
Rest of the night to hold me
Best of my love, yet to come
