Growing up wasn't easy for Annie Mae
(Hoo, hoo, hoo)
A little girl in a great big world
Annie Mae (hoo, hoo, hoo)
No one knew about her past
Some people swore she'd never last
She was (Growing up much too fast)
Growing (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Just a little too fast (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Never had her a Mama, no, no
Annie Mae (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Rarely heard a kind spoken word
Annie Mae (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Looking at life through an empty shell
And all the time she's catching hell
She was growing
(Growing up much too fast) up much too fast
Does anybody know where is Annie Mae today
Where oh where is Annie Mae
All you got to do is look into the faces of
All the young girls
On the avenue (Young girls!)
Oh, well, (Hoo, hoo, hoo) ha
In the night hear her cry, Annie Mae (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Hurt and pain keeps coming again
And again, and again, Annie Mae (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Trippin' and runnin' is blowin' her mind
Tryin' to decide if she'll make it this time
She was (Growing up) oh, yeah (Much too fast)
She was (Growing up much too fast)
Somebody got to stop her, oh Annie, Annie
(Ooh) (Hoo, hoo, hoo) (Where is Annie Mae)
Annie, Annie
Somebody
(Ooh) (Hoo, hoo, hoo) (Where is Annie Mae)
Got to stop her, oh, Annie, Annie
(Ooh) (Hoo, hoo, hoo) (Where is Annie Mae)
Annie, Annie
She's runnin', she's runnin'
Growin' up too fast, oh, oh
(She's runnin') oh, oh
Growin' up too fast, oh, oh
(She's runnin') oh, oh
Growin' up too fast, oh, hey
(She's runnin') Annie, Annie Mae, yeah
(She's runnin') Where you goin' Annie
(She's runnin') Don't you think somebody aught to stop you
(She's runnin') Somebody aught to stop you
