Wild women do
And they don't regret it
Woo
Here I come, baby

You tell me you want a woman
Who's as simple as a flower
Well, if you want me to act like that
You'd better pay me by the hour
Don't wanna travel in the danger zone
Take another number
Don't want a lover who can hold her own
Baby, step aside if you don't wanna ride
Because

Wild women do
And they don't regret it
Wild women show
What they're going through (Ooh, ooh)
Wild women do
What you think they'll never
What you only dream about
Wild women do (Oh, yes, they do)
You might also like
You think that love is a vision
Of a princess in a picture
Well, let me tell you something, little boy
You wouldn't know love if it hit you
Scared of someone who is off the wall
Kicking and a-screaming
Don't you want a lover who can do it all?
Listen to me, Jack
I ain't holding, back
'Cause

Wild women do
And they don't regret it
Wild women show
What they're going through (Ooh, ooh, yeah now)
Wild women do
What you think they'll never (Never, never, no)
What you only dream about
Wild women do (Oh, yes, they do)

Come on and wild with me, baby
Hey, everybody get wild
Everybody get wild, yes
Wild women do
And they don't regret it
Wild women show
What they're going through
(I'm not ashamed to show it, I'm not ashamed to show it)
Wild women do
What you think they'll never (And I never, never)
What you only dream about
Wild women do (I'm a wild child, baby)
And they don't regret it (Oh yeah, yeah)
Wild women show
What they're going through
What you think they'll never
(Oh, you know they should know better but I can't help myself)
What you only dream about
(I'm just a wild child)
