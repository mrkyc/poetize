Of rapin' and killin'
And government gold
The place Arizona
The year '84
Sit back and I'll tell you some more
A thirty year captain
Just earnin' his pay
Was movin' a shipment of bullion that day
While men without honor were waitin' to test
The unwritten code of the west
It's the code of the west
You must honor your neighbor
The code of the west
To your own self be true
The code of the west
You must do unto others
Do unto others before they do it unto you
Sweet yellow, sweet yellow
Sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold
So the town of Delores that morning in May
Was in for an infamous day
You might also likeYou don't draw with the stranger
If he's faster than you
You've sung your last ditty
You've kissed your last pretty
And played yer last hand if you do
When fate is the dealer you raise or you call
A chance takin' man plays the cards as they fall
A map worth a killin' is worth trackin' down
So off to Integrity town
The code of the west ain't some words on a page
You just naturally know it when you come of age
You eat when you're hungry, you drink when you're dry
You look every man in the eye
It's the code of the west when the boys talk of women
The code of the west what you know you don't tell
The code of the west a man soaps his own saddle
Brands his own cattle and some of his neighbour's as well
If you're buildin' fences then I ain't for hire
You get me for nothin' and I'll bring the wire
You patch up my windows, I'll plumb up your doors
If you scratch my back I'll scratch yours
It's the code of the west you must honour your neighbour
The code of the west to your own self be true
The code of the west you must do unto others
Do unto others before them others do it unto you
A yellow haired woman is early to bloom
Her laughter is roses
Her smile is perfume
But the child of the lawman can die on the vine
With no man to take of her wine
It's the code of the west
You don't leave for tomorrow
The code of the west
What can be done today
The code of the west
It's a true fact of livin'
What so lovingly given will lovingly come back yer way
The desert was losing its fight with the sun
As Cole stopped for water at hole number 1
Just what was he chasin' he'd sure like to know
But he still had him two holes to go
The code of the west
Show your backside to evil
The code of the west
Give the devil his due
The code of the west
You must do unto others
Do unto others before they do it unto you
Now rapin' and killin'
Ain't really so bad
But stealin' ole Blue
Now that made sheriff John mad
You don't help yourself to the eggs in the nest
Of the man with the badge on his vest
For tumbleweeds tumblin' from boulder to stone
Your permanent address is places unknown
You eat when your hungry
You drink when your dry
If wishes were eagles you'd fly
Rest your head on your saddle
Dream of fortune and fame
When the winds in the willow
A girl hugs her pillow
And wishes that she knew his name
Now treat a girl tender
She'll preen like a bride
But take her for granted
She'll come for your hide
She'll shoot off your head
If you leave her behind
And you'll loose your natural mind
Sweet yellow, sweet yellow, sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold
Your warm like a woman a treasure to hold
Sweet yellow sweet tangerine gold
You make a man fevered you make a man bold
Sweet yellow sweet tangerine gold
You got to do unto others
Do unto others before they do unto you
When a showdown is comin'
When a shootout is due
Face up to the danger
Throw a slug into a stranger
Before he throws one into you
You gotta do unto others
Do unto others before they do unto you
While Ben was playin' steal the gold and make your gettaway
The other three played shoot em up and turnabouts fair play
But Ben had tasted painted lips and heard the sirns song
So he could hardly keep from going wrong
It's the code of the west
Heed the word of your sisters
The code of the west
Make a left turn from sin
The code of the west
Keep an eye on temptation, recite the quotation
That says when Satan calls your name it doesn't matter
How you played the game 'cause all he cares about is
Did you win?
Now Cole and John and Henry J were feelin' mighty sad
To think a little sack of gold could turn a good man bad
But when you picked em meek and mild against the brave and bold
The meek inherit all the armys gold
Now in the meantime Billie girl was scemeing on her own
She know a healthy sweet young thing could live by bread alone
To play the tricky game of life a woman needs a plan
To play the game of love she needs a man
Now Lewton Cole know Billie had some mighty fetchin' ways
Ol' Ben would tell her everything and still get ninety days
Beneath the rock beside the trail that leads to Mexico
You'll find yourself a hundred pounds or so
It's the code of the west
Every girl needs a dowery
The code of the west
And it don't matter whose
The code of the west
When a girls pushin' twenty
She's gotta end up with plenty
If she wants to end up with rice in her shoes
Well Cole had a few other things left to do
He flowered his Stetson
And boarded ol Blue
The rougher you treat em
The stronger they grieve
And the longer they watch when you leave
Oh Mexico is just ahead so gambler move along
There ain't nobody there to care if you did right or wrong
You shot a thief ,you found some gold you stole a kiss or two
And the worlds a better place because of you
Oh the code of the west
When you're drinkin' toquilla
The code of the west
Toast the red white and blue
The code of the west
Be kind to your neighbors
Your new northern neighbors
