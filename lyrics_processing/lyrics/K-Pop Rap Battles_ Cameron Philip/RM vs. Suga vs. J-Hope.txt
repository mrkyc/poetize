Shut the fuck up and listen to your leader
They say you should join em if you cannot beat em
RM comin' with a 1, 2, punch
Reminder, that BTS started as ONE
Where would you little boys be without me?
What would you do, without me there to lead?
Couldn't survive in another country
I am trilingual, I am a beast
IQ feelin' like 148
That's more than both of yours combined
But wait-
Top 1 percent in South Korea
Nobody could ever match my career
Why you lookin so sad huh? Nan molla!
I can see you down there, im on the top
Yeah Mono was a hit
Hope World a flop
Yeah Mono was a hit

Rap Monster, you listen here
Betta grab your crabs the end is near
You rappin' first like Outro; Tear
But when im done, come out your tears
IQ 148-my ass!
I've seen you forget your damn passport, more than you been denied handshakes
"Expensive Girl", that shit was nasty!
Listen here, now Jung Hoseok
I hate to say it, but you SUCK
Just stick to dancing thats enough!
It hurts to say because I love you so much
Wait a minute ,scratch that last part, this a battle
I done had it, being savage to a man who i'm so proud of
Love his fashion, let love happen
I love it when he is rappin
In my dreams when I am nappin'
He's my best friend im so happy
When were together we laughin''
Wait--also I love Kim Namjoon
Thats my dude! Aways behind you!
I'd be lost livin' without you
PEACE!

Oh, Wow! Thank you Yoongi, um, I kinda feel bad about the stuff I wrote now,  But um....Ok, I mean, here goes!
Jung Hoseok is in this bitch!
My dick is long, i'm filthy rich
Now listen boys, this is the sitch
I'm Gonna kill you in this fit
Thats worth a quarter mill-i-on
When i'm on stage ARMY is lit
Give up now, kus I do not quit
Namjoon you cannot ride my whip
You are my HOPE, I am your HOPE
You wanna win, well I say NOPE
I turn women into some hoe's
I got two girls back at my home
So what do you say? Let's wrap it up
Don't make me dominate you subs!
Yoongi, why don't you take a nap
Namjoon, "Expensive Girl" was wack!
I am the best, these are the facts
Just play the Cyphers -listen back!
I am the sun, my shine is lit!
I'll burn you boys into a crisp!
Without me, there's no BTS
Without me, we won't be the best
Without me, you losers can't dance
