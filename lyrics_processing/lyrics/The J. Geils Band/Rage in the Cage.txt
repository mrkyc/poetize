Shopping center crazy
I need some fast relief
The boss says, "Boy, you're lazy"
But I'm just bored beyond belief
Laid off since last summer
Man, this really takes the cake
This town is like a prison
And I just got to make my break

They say "Be cautious, little mister," they shove it down your throat
I'm 'bout to choke, I'm gonna choke
I'm nauseous, my transistor's 'bout the only antidote
To keep my temperature from runnin' wild
Let me hear that radio

There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage (There's a rage in the cage)

Sweet Diana to the rescue
Hot potato to my aid
She's the girl with the swirl
Like air-conditioned lemonade
But the lady's on the hotplate
Daddy's threatened to disown
Handcuffed tight in a chain of events
I guess I'm out here on my own
You might also like
It don't take a PhD to know I'm goin' nowhere fast
I've got to move, I'm on the move
It don't take much to see this town is livin' in the past
They all just seem to wanna tie me down
Let me hear the radio

There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage (There's a rage in the cage)

I wanna rock it
I've got to rock it
I've gotta get me on that rocket ship to outta here
Watch out


This town is wearin' ear plugs, I'm of age and loose to juice
But they say stop, you better stop
There's a fire in the furnace breakin' out and breakin' loose
You know I'm just about to lose my mind
They don't want me paralyzed
They just want me neutralized
Rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage (Rage in the cage)

There's a rage in the cage (Hey now, hey now)
There's a rage in the cage (Hey now, hey now, there's a rage in the cage when I hear the radio)
There's a rage in the cage (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
There's a rage in the cage (Oh-oh, oh-oh, there's a rage in the cage, a-ba-ba-ba-ba, yeah)
There's a rage in the cage (Hey)
There's a rage in the cage (There's a rage in the cage, rage in the cage)
There's a rage in the cage
There's a rage in the cage (There's a rage in the cage, there's a rage in the cage)
There's a rage in the cage
