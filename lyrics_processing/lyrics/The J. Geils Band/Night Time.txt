The sunlight in my eyes is playing tricks with my head
I work like a dog on the job every day
I'm tryin make some money so I can go and play
In the night time
That's the right time
In the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you in the night time
I come home from work you know I'm tired and I'm beat
I run in the kitchen get me something to eat
I jump in the shower wash the world off my back
I'm gonna get you baby that's a natural fact!
In the night time
That's the right time
In the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you in the night time

A hundred million people they got nothing to say
They're running around in circles they just live for today
Stick with me baby I'll show you how to fly
We'll make such pretty music watch the world go by

Get up in the morning kick the covers from my bed
The sunlight in my eyes is playing tricks with my head
