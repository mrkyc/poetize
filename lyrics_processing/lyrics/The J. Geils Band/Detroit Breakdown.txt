Everybody's doin' it right in the hall
Plaster is fallin' right on the floor
We're tearin' it up and that's for sure
Doin' the Detroit breakdown
Oh, Motor City shakedown
A-doin' the Detroit breakdown
I said the Motor City shakedown
Jumpin' toes and everything goes
Hot night, sweatin' right in your clothes
I'm bittersweet for dancin' feet
Everybody did it, found her right in the street
Doin' the Detroit breakdown
I said Motor City shakedown
Ow, Detroit breakdown
Hey, Motor City shakedown
I'm losin' touch, I'm feelin' no pain
Everything is headed right down the drain
I'm gettin' crazy, this I swear
I'm past my limit, honey, I don't care

Oh, Motor City shakedown
