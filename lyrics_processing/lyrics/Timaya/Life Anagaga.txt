M.I
Way back then, i was so razz
Before anybody ever heard my vocals
Before awards, and the shows and promoters
Man dey sleep by himself, i mean no gurls
I remember wen guys couldn't toast
Cuz to toast, you need bread and the bread wasn't clothes
And the clothes that we pose with, to get noticed
Was from Yaba bend-down and so no chicks
But ask about me now, Google M.I
I gat so many shows, they call me the event guy
I fly so many times a year, i should rent sky
Keep it up for Mr. Incredibulent guy
Call M.I, Mr. I don try
I gat the Doe baby, wetin you wan buy
And all my enemies now, wetin dey wan try
I dey glow like the sunshine
And now, House i gat it, gat it; Money i gat it, gat it; Clothes i gat, i gat it; Cars i gat it, gat it
Anytin you want, baby gurl i can give you cuz i gat it, gat it
Yes i gat it, gat it

Shoes i gat it, gat it(Egberi Popsi)
Money i gat it, gat it
