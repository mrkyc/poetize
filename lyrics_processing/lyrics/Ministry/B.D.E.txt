This is a nightmare
Big dick energy
Toxic misogyny, violence
Toxic misogyny, violence
Toxic misogyny
Using, using violence
Toxic misogyny, violence
Toxic misogyny, violence
Toxic misogyny
This is a nightmare
Horny little boys full of hormones and hate
Waging war on women 'cause they can't get a date
Stockpiling their weapons 'cause they think their dicks get bigger
Waiting for the chance to finally pull the fucking trigger
Hating what you cannot have
Killing what you cannot be
(Fuck, fuck, fuck)
(Fuck, fuck, fuck)
No one can justify their toxic behavior
(Fuck, fuck)
Big dick energy

It comes down to controlling women's bodies
It's the birth rates, birth rates
Let me give you a hint, I'm not just a vagina
Big dick energy
Toxic little man with the toxic little plan
Fuck 'em all, kill em all, both if you can
There's no relief in sight from the crazy far right
They'll never get to fuck, so they just kill out of spite
Hating what you cannot have
Killing what you cannot be
Well, I don't think so
(Fuck, fuck, fuck)
(Fuck, fuck, fuck)
No one can justify their toxic behavior
(Fuck, fuck)
Big dick energy
Controlling women's bodies
Insecurity
Controlling women's bodies
Using, using violence, violence
They're all focused on the idea of-
Slaughter, slaughter, slaughter, slaughter
(Slaughter) Sorry that you can't get laid
(Slaughter) Big dick masquerade
(Slaughter) Tough guys so afraid
(Slaughter) Fucking losers on parade
(Slaughter) Toxic masculinity
(Slaughter) Toxic ideology
(Slaughter) Toxic misogyny
Big dick energy
Big dick energy
You don't hate me, you hate yourself
I'm not gonna have your baby, you fucking loser
Big dick energy
(Fuck, fuck, fuck)
(Fuck, fuck, fuck)
Big dick energy
(Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck) No one can justify their toxic behavior
(Fuck, fuck) Big dick energy
(Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck) Who trusts a guy whose gun is his savior?
