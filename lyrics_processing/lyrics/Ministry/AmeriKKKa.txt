"I want you
I want you
To get up
To get up
To get up
To get up"

Well, I walked a mile today
In someone else's pair of shoes
I came home tired and disgusted
Just walking home from Hatred Avenue

What you want, what you feel
You will never forget
What you know, what you trust
You should always suspect
What you say, what you do
It makes you regret
What you think, what you see
You should always resent

"I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell"
You might also like"Mad as hell
Mad as hell
Mad as hell"

Well, I heard some news today
I guess we're going to war
We don't know who we're fighting
We don't know what we're fighting for

What you want, what you feel
You will never forget
What you know, what you trust
You should always suspect
What you say, what you do
It makes you regret
What you think, what you see
You should always resent

"I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell"
"I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)
I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)
I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)"

It's like the Nazis back in '39
Like the Romans on the verge of decline


"I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)
I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)
I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)"

Like the Russians back in '68
How is this supposed to make America great?

Well, I guess the truth is hiding
Beyond the walls of the USA
This is exciting
Don't have to listen to anything you say

What you want, what you feel
You will never forget
What you know, what you trust
You should always suspect
What you say, what you do
It makes you regret
What you think, what you see
You should always resent
"I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell"
"I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)
I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)
I'm mad as hell (Mad as hell)"

It's like the Nazis back in '39
Like the Romans on the verge of decline
Like the Russians back in '68
How is this supposed to make America great?
Listen to me!

"I want you to get up
I want you to get up
(I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
And I'm not gonna take this anymore!)
I want you to get up
I want you to get up
(I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
And I'm not gonna take this anymore!)
I want you to get up
I want you to get up
(I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
And I'm not gonna take this anymore!)
I want you to get up
I want you to get up
(I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
I'm mad as hell
And I'm not gonna take this anymore!)"


What you want, what you feel
You will never forget
What you know, what you trust
You should always suspect
What you say, what you do
It makes you regret

Well... I guess I don't know what to expect...
Well... I guess that's all we got...
"I want you
To get up
I want you
To get up
I want you
To get up
