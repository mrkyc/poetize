I'm telling you:
Your day of judgment, it's coming...
Nothing gets me off more
Than the smell of a good gas fire death
Damn...
Smells like, yeah... like judgment is calling
Because war is fucking sexy...
You're fucking nothing against an army
They're coming...

Death, power, and sex
These are the things that we do best
Which country wants it next?
Not many left to molest

Yeah... I remember that feeling
It was fucking righteous
The violence right in front
Of my fucking face
I felt it from my gut
Down to my fucking balls
You know that fucking feeling...
It's fucking tight...
Makes you want to feel more
It's like fucking sex
Watching that fucking blood on TV
I got a gun
I'll fucking use it, too
Why not? Everybody else does...
And apparently...
I got the complexion for the connection...

A state of war"

"'I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons'
And they are beautiful pictures
Of fearsome armaments 
What did they hit?"

Violence! We love it!
We just can't get enough of it!
Wartocracy and S&M
We're dropping bombs on them again

Subjugate, then rape
No one's allowed to escape
Carnage and calamity
It's how we masturbate

That is the red, white, and blue"
