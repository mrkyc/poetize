The term "antifa"
Short for "antifascist"
The organization
Which has a violent history
In Europe and South America
But has largely been unknown
In the United States until very recently
(Anarchists, anarchists, anarchists)
They're the ones responsible
For Trump supporters
Being beaten by the pigs
Setting fire to cars
Pepper-spraying old men
Pelting women with eggs
And smashing out windows and ATMs
(Antifa)
The groups compromising Antifa
Consider the many people
Across the country
Who voted Trump into office
To be literally Nazis
(Antifa)
They were a revolutionary response
In large groups
Waving the red and black flag
(Red and black flag, red and black flag)

I've got something to say to you
I'll back it up with my fist
Sick and tired of dealing with assholes
That's why I resist

We're not snowflakes
We are the antifa

Right wing is in free fall
Skinheads taking a dive
Antifa is coming for you
They won't survive

We're not snowflakes
We are the antifa

What do we want?
Violence, violence
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Violence, violence
When do we want it?
Now!

Anarchy in the USA is here
(Antifa, antifa, antifa)
Here
(Antifa, antifa, antifa)

Brownshirt little snowflakes
Never want to admit
Terrified of the red and black flag
Antifa's the shit

We're not snowflakes
We are the antifa
(Antifa, antifa, antifa)
We're not snowflakes
We are the antifa

When they come together
In mass demonstrational riot
They are effectively...
(Antifa, antifa)
Some of them may refer
To themselves as black bloc
(Black bloc, black bloc)
Although, technically, black bloc
Is a tactic and not an organization
(Antifa, antifa)
Black bloc is especially useful
When some people bring sweats to the action
(Antifa, antifa)
They may break the law, break the law
Antifa, antifa
