Jew, Gentile, Black man, White"

Polarized, divisive
Drowning in strife
Technically, I still exist
But not in my mind

"Greed has poisoned men's souls
Has barricaded the world with hate
Has goose-stepped us
Into misery and bloodshed
We have developed speed
But we have shut ourselves in
("Even now, my voice is reaching millions
Throughout the world")
"Our knowledge has made us cynical
Our cleverness, hard and unkind
We think too much and feel too little"
"Let us all unite!"
"...gentleness"

Silence of majority
Silver linings prevail (Greed)
Golden dreams remember
Remember to exhale

Wake up, take it in
Exhale, repeat
Fire up, freak out
Let it go
