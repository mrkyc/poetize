You've ran out of lies
Stronger than reason
Stronger than lies
The only truth I know
Is the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes
Just like a car crash
Just like a knife
My favorite weapon
Is the look in your eyes
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
Get out of my life
I'm chewing on glass
And eating my fingers
I'm not the one
Who's run out of lies, lies
You might also likeYou've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of time
Cutting my face
And walking on splinters
I lost my soul
To the look in your eyes, your eyes
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of lies
You've ran out of time
Stigmata
You've ran out of lies
Oh, you have empty eyes
