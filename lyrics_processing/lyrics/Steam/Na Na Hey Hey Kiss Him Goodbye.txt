Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye

He'll never love you the way that I love you
'Cause if he did, no no, he wouldn't make you cry

He might be thrillin' baby, but a-my love (My love, my love)
So dog-gone willin', so kiss him
(I wanna see you kiss him, wanna see you kiss him)
Go on and kiss him goodbye, now

Na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye
(Listen to me now)

He's never near you to comfort and cheer you
When all those sad tears are fallin', baby, from your eyes

He might be thrillin' baby but a-my love (My love, my love)
So dog-gone willin', so kiss him
(I wanna see you kiss him, I wanna see you kiss him)
Go on and kiss him goodbye
