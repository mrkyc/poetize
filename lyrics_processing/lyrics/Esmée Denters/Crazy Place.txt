It's the most beautiful thing
I think I've ever seen
A homeless child playing with something
As simple as a cardboard box
And he seems so happy
With that smile on his face
Like nothing matters
He's so serene
When he doesn't even know
If he's gonna live through another day
Worrying about what he's gonna eat

When I look at that
It kinda makes me feel guilty
'Cause the world that I'm living in
Only seems to care about having enough money
To buy luxurious things that we don't even need
I'm not trying to be the good girl
To save the world
'Cause I do the same damn thing

Isn't it a shame?
But we only have ourselves to blame
When love is the most beautiful thing
But it's a lost somewhere along the way
To money and fame (Money and fame)
Isn't the world a crazy place?
You might also like
We were all brought up with different dreams and beliefs
But the one thing we all need
Is to be loved by friends and family
And when a child like that
With no parents around is able to smile
Makes me feel very weak, small, and vulnerable

When I look at that
It kinda makes me feel guilty
'Cause the world that I'm living in
Only seems to care about having enough money
To buy luxurious things that we don't even need
I'm not trying to be the good girl
To save the world
'Cause I do the same damn thing

Isn't it a shame?
But we only have ourselves to blame
When love is the most beautiful thing
But it's a lost somewhere along the way
To money and fame (Money and fame)
Isn't the world a crazy place?
It makes me conscious of all of the things
I have and makes me feel oh so fast
It makes me want to follow my dreams
And try to be a better person
It takes me to a higher level
It makes me wipe away all my tears
It helps me put a smile on my face
'Cause everything I need is right here

Isn't it a shame?
But we only have ourselves to blame
When love is the most beautiful thing
But it's a lost somewhere along the way
To money and fame (Money and fame)
Isn't it a shame?
But we only have ourselves to blame
When love is the most beautiful thing
But it's a lost somewhere along the way
To money and fame

Isn't the world a crazy place?
