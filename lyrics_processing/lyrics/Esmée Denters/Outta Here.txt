Get me outta here
'Cause my eyes are burning from these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don't really care
And you never loved me
Someone get me outta this place
(One, two, three, four!) Right now

It's so amazing
How you have so many faces
And you are not that person
I thought that I had fell so deep in love with

You changed up your make-up, your DNA
I can't recognize, you're a stranger to me
I feel so betrayed
What a waste of my heart and me

Get me outta here
'Cause my eyes are burning from these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don't really care
And you never loved me
Someone get me outta this place
Right now
You might also like
My body's trembling
It's so damn hard to kick this feelin'
Your heart is so cold and now I'm freezin'
Wish you could feel the pain
Maybe I will arrange it, yeah, yeah, yeah

You changed up your make-up, your DNA
I can't recognize, you're a stranger to me
I feel so betrayed
What a waste of my heart and me

Get me outta here
'Cause my eyes are burning from these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don't really care
And you never loved me
Someone get me outta this place

I thought that we were forever
I guess I misunderstood
My fault for thinking you loved me
Or even thinking you ever could
Get me out of here right now
Get me out of here right now
Get me outta here
'Cause my eyes are burning from these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don't really care
And you never loved me (No)
Someone get me outta this place
Get me outta here (Oh)
'Cause my eyes are burning from these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don't really care (You don't really care)
And you never loved me
Someone get me outta this place

(One, two, three, four!)
Right now (Right, right, right, right)
Right now (Right, right, right)
Right now
Someone get me outta this place
