Some say it's better to have loved then lost
But I don't know the feeling at all
And baby, it's mostly your fault
Ever since you put a move on my heart
And I can't see the world around me
I only see what we created
And I don't know what's behind me
I only look forward to how we make it

Are the stars out tonight? Is it cloudy or bright?
I only have eyes for you, only have eyes for you
Does the moon seem far away? If it is, I can't say
I only have eyes for you, I only have eyes for you

Boy, I wanna be where you are
I wanna wrap my arms around you
It's not like I'm tryna go too far
It's just that I wanna surround you
And I can't tell if it's night or day
'Cause everything is brightened by your smile
Don't know if I have the right of way
'Cause my pulse's racing a thousand miles
Baby boy, you're just too much
I wanna give you all of my love
I get a rush just by your touch
You're all that I've been thinking of
You might also like
Are the stars out tonight? Is it cloudy or bright?
I only have eyes for you, only have eyes for you
Does the moon seem far away? If it is, I can't say
I only have eyes for you, I only have eyes for you

You're the only one
Boy, nobody compares to you
Boy, you're all that I want
Not a day goes by without me thinking 'bout you
Even if the walls came crumbling down
No, I wouldn't even notice at all
Even if the city blacked out right now
Baby, you're still my shining star

Are the stars out tonight? Is it cloudy or bright?
I only have eyes for you, only have eyes for you
Does the moon seem far away? If it is, I can't say
I only have eyes for you, I only have eyes for you
Are the stars out tonight? Is it cloudy or bright?
I only have eyes for you, only have eyes for you
Does the moon seem far away? If it is, I can't say
I only have eyes for you, I only have eyes for you
Hey, hey, yeah, boy, I only got my eyes on you
