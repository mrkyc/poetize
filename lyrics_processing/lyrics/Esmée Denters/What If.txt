I can remember all the times I tried to tell you
Just what was on my mind, but I couldn't find the words to say
I'm so confused by the thought of you and me together
And I'm afraid you might not feel the same

Even if you did, would it change everything?
And we could try, but maybe it's not meant to be

Oh, what if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about
What if, what if? What if, what if? What if, what if?
What if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about
What do we do when all breaks down?

Now I don't know where to go and who to turn to
It has always been you, nut I don't wanna lose you, not this way
I'm not even sure if it's real what I feel, but I know that I need you
But I'm afraid you might not feel the same
You might also like
Even if you did, would it change everything?
And we could try but maybe it's not meant to be

Oh, what if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about
What if, what if? What if, what if? What if, what if?
What if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about
What do we do when all breaks down?

What if you feel the way I feel? We could try
But it could all go wrong in the end
And I don't want us to fall apart
Maybe it's better to stay friends
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo

What if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about
What if, what if? What if, what if? What if, what if?
What if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about
What do we do when all breaks down?
What if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about?
What if, what if? What if, what if? What if, what if?
What if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about
