Ohh, ohh

I think my heart might explode
'Cause now I feel the weight of your love on me now
From my head down to my toes
And I can't handle nothin' else
I'm starring at the mirror at these clothes
That is funny, they mean about as much as yesterday
Something is calling me home, me home
I can hear your voice and I'm not afraid

Now I know I'm just a girl
Trying to make my way through this life
Now I feel bigger than the world
With your hand in mine
Like a speeding bullet
Tryin' to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger than the world
With your hand in mine

Boy, I'll take care of the storm
Let's sneak right past the clouds where it's warm
And I can handle the people
They're just pebble's on the long, long road
I'm staring at the sky at those stars
And it's funny, they seem about as far as tomorrow
Something is calling me home, me home
And I'm not afraid, no
'Cause I can see everything from high above
The Earth is a little place next to my love
I can reach here from where you are
Just look for me in the sky, I'm not that far
You might also like
Now I know I'm just a girl
Trying to make my way through this life
Now I feel bigger than the world
With your hand in mine
Like a speeding bullet
Tryin' to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger than the world
With your hand in mine

And now I feel bigger than the trees
That hold the leaves
Bigger than the mountains
That touch the sea
Bigger than the night
That needs to stay
Bigger than the waves
That crash the bay

Bigger, oh ooh, bigger oh ooh
Bigger, oh ooh, oh oh ooh
Bigger, oh ooh, bigger oh ooh
Bigger, oh ooh, oh oh oh
When all of the world seems to get you down
Just know that I'm always gonna be around
My heart's in my head and it's where it'll stay
I love you too much, just like I did today

Now I know I'm just a girl
Trying to make my way through this life
Now I feel bigger than the world
With your hand in mine
Like a speeding bullet
Tryin' to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger than the world
With your hand in mine
And now I know I'm just a girl
Trying to make my way through this life
Now I feel bigger than the world
With your hand in mine
Like a speeding bullet
Tryin' to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger than the world
