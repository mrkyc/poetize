Can anybody tell me why
I feel like I just lost control?
And I can't get it back, no matter how hard I try
There's no way to say goodbye
And I don't even know if I wanna go
We'd be lying if we didn't say that something just don't feel right

Well, we keep talkin' and talkin'
But nothing ever seems to come out of it
And I know that I can't make you see the way I feel
Well, now my heart is broken and I just can't make any sense of it
All I know is your everything that's real, oh

This ain't the way it's supposed to be when you're in love
You got me stuck here on the ground
Everything feels heavy
And I can't carry the weight for the both of us
Your gravity's holding me down

I can't move on
'Cause gravity is holding me down
I don't know how
But your gravity is holding me down
Wanna spread my wings and go
Your gravity is holding me down
I don't know how
But your gravity is holding me down, down
You might also like
What's going on? I don't wanna feel this way
I keep going on to the way that it used to be
Now tell me, where to go from here?
I don't wanna lose this thing we had
But I kept tonight so far away from me

Well, we keep talkin' and talkin'
But nothing ever seems to come out of it
And I know that I can't make you see the way I feel
Well, now my heart is broken and I just can't make any sense of it
All I know is your everything that's real, oh

This ain't the way it's supposed to be when you're in love
You got me stuck here on the ground
Everything feels heavy
And I can't carry the weight for the both of us
Your gravity's holding me down

I can't move on
'Cause gravity is holding me down
I don't know how
But your gravity is holding me down
Wanna spread my wings and go
Your gravity is holding me down
I don't know how
But your gravity is holding me down
This ain't the way it's supposed to be when you're in love
You got me stuck here on the ground
Everything feels heavy
And I can't carry the weight for the both of us
Your gravity's holding me down

I can't move on
'Cause gravity is holding me down
I don't know how
But your gravity is holding me down (Gravity is holding me down)
Wanna spread my wings and go
Your gravity is holding me down
I don't know how
But your gravity is holding me down, down

(Ooh) Gravity is holding me down
(Ooh) Gravity is holding me down
(Ooh) Gravity is holding me down
(Ooh)
