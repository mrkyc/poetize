(Mmm)
(Oooh)

Hangin' in the hood, givin' me the eye
I get the message; Why you gotta act shy?
Looking at your light ahead
I can read your mind, you really want it bad
I can tell by the look on your face
That you're really really really really into me

Is it me or is it hot in here?
(Burnin' up, adrenaline rush, can't get enough)
Is it really really or am I just imagining?
(Do I want it too much? Am I makin' it up?)
I try to ignore you, babe
But I keep coming back for more

Just admit it
I know you want it
Why you over there
When you could be right here?
Come and get it
You know I got it
Can't you read the signs?
Why you wasting time?
When you could be mine
(Just admit it, admit it)
(Just admit it, admit it)

Trying to impress, got me acting like a fool
Don't want you to see me, but I really do
Cause I'm the type of girl who's used to playin' it cool
If you wanna win me over, it's up to you
(Yeah, baby)
Come on, come on, come on and make your move

Is it me or is it hot in here?
(Burnin' up, adrenaline rush, can't get enough)
Is it really really or am I just imagining?
(Do I want it too much? Am I makin' it up?)
I try to ignore you, babe
But I keep coming back for more

Just admit it
I know you want it
Why you over there
When you could be right here?
Come and get it
You know I got it
Can't you read the signs?
Why you wasting time?
When you could be mine
(Just admit it, admit it)
(Just admit it, admit it)
When you could be mine
(Just admit it admit it)
(Just admit it admit it)
When you could be mine
(Just admit it admit it)
(Just admit it admit it)
You could be mine (Oooh)
