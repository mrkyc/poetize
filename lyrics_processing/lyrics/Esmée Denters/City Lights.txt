Looking at the stars
I'm not coming down
'Cause I know I'mma never stop
Sitting on the roof top
Looking at the stars
I'm not comin' down
(Down, down, down, down, down)
Bright like the city lights, city lights, city lights
This was coming
Now we're taking, making mo-o-ore
(Oh, oh, oh)
Bright like the city lights, city lights, city lights
This was coming
Now we're taking, making mo-o-ore
(Yeh, yeh, yeh)
When I was younger
Yeah, I knew that I was born to do this
Ain't nothing to it (uh)
I said to my mama I'm a star
She said, "Don't get in trouble
Living in your bubble."
(Yeh)

I'm always looking for a good time
All I need is one night
Yeah, the stage is all mine
