One, two, two, three, three, uhh, hands up
I'll show what it do, I got my stance up (Whoa)
Everybody knows this is the anthem
Everybody knows this is the anthem
So get your hands up, go

You don't feel love from nobody
And brand new problems keep coming
They follow you, you keep running
So down boy, don't you hear something?
Gone through it if you just listen
It might just make you look different
Just let it go, you won't miss it
Nothing to lose, just go with it

What is that?
Could it be the rescue that you need?
It's not a dream, that's happening
Hands up come, with me
What is that?
Could it be the rescue that you need?
It's not a dream, that's happening
Hands up come, with me
You might also like
Follow my lead
And we'll go where no one goes
When everyone leaves
I'll be the one still standing strong
Listen to me, love is a song
I'll be the melody, you'll be my drum
Follow my lead and we'll go where no one goes

The world around you keeps changing
Come back to what you keep waiting
For something to come and save you
Just let it in, let it take you
To a place where every thing's better
'Cause you've been waiting forever
Live life like it don't matter
It won't stop if you don't let it

What is that?
Could it be the rescue that you need?
It's not a dream, that's happening
Hands up come, with me
What is that?
Could it be the rescue that you need?
It's not a dream, that's happening
Hands up come, with me
Follow my lead
And we'll go where no one goes
When everyone leaves
I'll be the one still standing strong
Listen to me, love is a song
I'll be the melody, you'll be my drum
Follow my lead and we'll go where no one goes

Uh, hands up (Hands up)
I'll show what it do
I got my stance up (Stance up)
Everybody knows this is the anthem (This is the anthem)
Everybody knows this is the anthem (Yeah)
So get your hands up
Hands up (Hands up)
I'll show what it do, I got my stance up (I got the stance up)
Everybody knows this is the anthem (This is the anthem)
Everybody knows this is the anthem
So get your hands up

Follow my lead
And we'll go where no one goes
When everyone leaves
I'll be the one still standing strong
Listen to me, love is a song
I'll be the melody, you'll be my drum
Follow my lead and we'll go where no one goes
