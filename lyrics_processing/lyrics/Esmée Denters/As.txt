(tuh-ru-tuh..)
As around the sun the Earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always(extended)
Chorus
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (allways)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
(hmmm uh, this is gonna be allways)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
(you know it's gonaa be allways)
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more(extended)
Mary J. Blige
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
George Michael:
As today I know I'm living in tomorrow(yeahhhhh)
Could make me the past
But that I must'n fear
Mary J
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
George/ mary j
And I'll be loving you allways
Background chorus
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (been loving you)
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea (loving you)
Until we dream of live and live becomes a dream
(now ain't that loving you?)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (allllllllways)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (i'll be loving you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (alllways)
Until the day that is the day are no more(extended) (yeahhhhh)
