Yeah, c'mon

You wanna get carried away on the waves of freedom
Now get ready, it's that time of the year
Don't wanna lose yourself and give into temptation
Who cares, who's gonna know
We're dangerous, delirious
Acting like we're famous
Tell all the boys we're messing about
We'll be the talk of the town
Driving through the city with the top down
Everything is better when the sun's out
Everything is better when the sun's out

You can't tell us nothing, no no
It's summer cause we say so
There's no trouble in paradise
Now we got the whole world singing, shout it out

We got that crazy, that sexy, that beautiful
We got that young, that foolish, that freaky love
Can you hear the beat of the wild hearts
Can you hear the beat of the wild hearts
You might also like
We got that sugar sweet, innocent, naughty but confident
Everybody here is a 10 out of 10
Don't want this day to end
Driving through the city with the top down
Everything is better when the sun's out
Everything is better when the sun's out

You can't tell us nothing, no no
It's summer cause we say so
There's no trouble in paradise
Now we got the whole world singing, shout it out

We got that crazy, that sexy, that beautiful
We got that young, that foolish, that freaky love
Can you hear the beat of the wild hearts
Can you hear the beat of the wild hearts

It's summer cause we say so
From the beach we take it to the dance floor
Now listen all, can you hear the wild hearts?

We got that crazy, that sexy, that beautiful
We got that young, that foolish, that freaky love
Can you hear the beat of the wild hearts
Can you hear the beat of the wild hearts
We got that crazy, that sexy, that beautiful
We got that young, that foolish, that freaky love
Can you hear the beat of the wild hearts
