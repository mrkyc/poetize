Did anybody hear that? (Oh)
There's a string that just broke in my heart
I can feel it
And the sound of it tears me apart
Play it again (-gain, oh)
'Cause I
Don't recognize this song anymore (Oh)
Can you make it sound like it did before?

It's the same old melody
And I can't stand what you do to me
Why you keep strummin' all the strings of my heart? My heart
It beats like a timpani
But you stole that away from me
I should've known it right from the start (Oh baby)

All I know is I don't wanna hurt no more (Hurt no more)
All I know is our song needs a different chord (Different chord)
'Cause there's so many times that I feel like we've been here before (Here before)
I stay cryin' while you walk out the door

I hear a sad, sad symphony (So let these strings cry)
A sad, sad symphony (So let these strings cry)
It's like a sad, sad symphony (So let these strings cry)
I hear a sad, sad symphony (So let these strings cry)
You might also like
Somebody save me
'Cause I'm surrounded by all of these sounds
It's driving me crazy
'Cause you're playing me way too loud
All I hear is noise
(Now I) can't hear my own voice
(Now I) I didn't wanna tell you so
But you're bringin' me down (Bringin' me down)

It's the same old melody
And I can't stand what you do to me
Why you keep strummin' all the strings of my heart? My heart
It beats like a timpani
But you stole that away from me
I should've known it right from the start (Ooh baby)

All I know is I don't wanna hurt no more (Hurt no more)
All I know is our song needs a different chord (Different chord)
'Cause there's so many times that I feel like we've been here before (Here before)
I stay cryin' while you walk out the door

I hear a sad, sad symphony (So let these strings cry)
A sad, sad symphony (So let these strings cry)
It's like a sad, sad symphony (So let these strings cry)
I hear a sad, sad symphony (So let these strings cry)
The song in my head won't leave
Everywhere I go, it plays
Takin' the beat from my heart
I wanna hear the encore, but I guess we're stuck (We're stuck)
'Cause I already know this part
And it seems we just can't get past the start (Oh)

All I know is I don't wanna hurt no more (I don't wanna hurt no more)
All I know is our song needs a different chord (Different chord)
'Cause there's so many times that I feel like we've been here before (Here before)
I stay cryin' while you walk out the door (Walk out the door)

I hear a sad, sad symphony (I hear) (So let these strings cry)
A sad, sad symphony (I hear) (So let these strings cry)
It's like a sad, sad symphony (I hear) (So let these strings cry)
I hear a sad, sad symphony (I hear) (So let these strings cry)
