I used to look in the mirror
Felt so uncomfortable
I always felt like I was different from everybody else
I didn't want any attention
I got lost in the crowd
So busy tryna fit in
When I was born to stand out

I felt like my best
Wasn't good enough (Wasn't good enough)
But I'm not the same girl
That I once was

I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry 'bout what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
I'm feeling good

If you ever feel like I did
No, it don't have to be that way
'Cause you are perfect the way you are
You shouldn't have to be ashamed
'Cause we are all a work in progress
You gotta work with that you got
Rather be true to myself
Than to be who I'm not
You might also like
So if you're unlike anyone else you know
That's what makes you original

I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry 'bout what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
I'm feeling good

Let go of who you think that you need to be
You are so much more than what they may see
Let it all out and set it free
Darlin', what you got is all you need
Let go of who you think that you need to be
You are so much more than what they may see
Let it all out and set it free
Darlin', what you got is all you need

I'm no longer insecure
'Cause life is just too short to worry about what others think
I'm feeling good in this skin
That I live in
There is nothing I would change
