It was the summer that changed our lives forever
Do you remember all of the nights we spent together
We were foolish, crazy and reckless
Acting careless and jealous
There was nothing between hell and heaven

It'll never be like when you were mine
It was a first time that I ever felt so alive
And when you left me, I swear that I could die
And for the first time, I felt like the world was gonna end

Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like my first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like my first love, ain't nothing
Cause it'll never be like when you were mine
Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like my first love, ain't nothing

Never felt such pleasure and so much pain
I wanted you so bad but you were playing games
Thought that you had the answers to all of my questions
Guess I was too young, too young to understand
You might also like
It'll never be like when you were mine
It was a first time that I ever felt so alive
And when you left me, I swear that I could die
And for the first time, I felt like the world was gonna end

Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like my first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like my first love
'Cause it'll never be like when you were mine
Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like my first love

Everything changes but the memories remain
And one thing is for certain, it'll never be the same
It won't be like the first love, not like the first love
It won't be like the first love, oh

Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like my first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like my first love, ain't nothing
'Cause it'll never be like when you were mine
Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
Everything changes, but the memories remain
And one thing is for certain, it'll never be the same
It won't be like the first love, ain't nothing
Ain't nothing like your first love, ain't nothing
