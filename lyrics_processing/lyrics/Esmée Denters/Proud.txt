So wipe the tears from your eyes
'Cause I really hate to see you cry
And I gotta do this without you
It's time to find my own truth
Step out of the shadows and into the light
And when I'm far away from home
I'll take you with me wherever I go
You tell me everything you know
I know you're worried and you're scared
But it'll be worth it I swear
I wanna show you that I care
I'm sorry that I'm not around
Wish I could be there right now
'Cause I don't wanna let you down
I just wanna make you proud
I don't let you have your doubts
Promise it'll all workout
'Cause I don't mean to let you down
I just wanna make you proud
I know you're tryna protect me
But all I need you to do
Is trust me in me and I'll do the right thing
You know I'm a fighter
'Cause I've watched you be strong
Over and over time and time again
Oh-oh
