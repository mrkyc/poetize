Listen
It's 11 o'clock and the last time that we talked
He said he's busy and he'd call me
But he never called me back (No)
And now I feel like somethings going on
But I feel crazy every time I bring it up, so I don't
He told me there's no one above me
And all of my friends are telling me different
And something seems funny
Tell me, do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love?
I can still hear voices in my head like...

I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on ya
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
'Cause he's playing a part
Why didn't I see it from the start?
How was I to know it would bruise my heart?
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
Like a wave, you took me under, now it's so hard to breathe
You might also like
And I guess I'm just too young to play with love (Hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (Sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (Hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (You lived another, 'nother day)

I shoulda never given into his games
Shoulda only been the type that treat me the same
And it ain't fair cause I gave him all I had
Now there's nothing left (These tears will dry and you'll move on, on and on and on)
This songs the same thing
Can't keep fallin'
No more heartbreak
Tell me, do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love?
Cause I still hear everybody's voice like...

I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on ya
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Cause he's playing a part
Why didn't I see it from the start?
How was I to know it would bruise my heart?
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
Like a wave you took me under now it's so hard to breathe
And I guess I'm just too young to play with love (Hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (Sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (Hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (You lived another, 'nother day)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (Hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (Sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (Hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (You lived another, 'nother day)

And so I cry, cry, cry
Ask myself why, why, why
And that I cry, cry, cry
So why should I try, try, try?
And so I cry, cry, cry (Hey)
Ask myself why, why, why (Sometimes it has to be this way)
And that I cry, cry, cry (Hey)
So why should I try, try, try?

And I guess I'm just too young to play with love (Hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (Sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (Hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (You lived another, 'nother day)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (Hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (Sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (Hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (You lived another, 'nother day)
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
