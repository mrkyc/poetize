Just can't have it, just can't have it, uh
Said I just can't have it, just can't have it
Just can't have it, just can't have it
No, I just can't have it, just can't have it

It's been about twenty days now
And the truth is that I really miss you, in my life
I heard that bouncing back was easy
But I can't seem to get you, off my mind

And I know that you can't hear me
But I think about you every day
And I have the shortest memory
But I can't forget the pain
That I felt when you went away

I can't have it both ways
I'm sorry that I said goodbye
People say I did the right thing
But they don't have to cry
I can love you for all the things that you are
And then hate you for all the things that you're not
I want you to go, I want you to stay
But I can't have it both ways
No, I can't have it both ways
You might also like
You used to put the "S" in selfish
Most time the only one you cared for, was yourself (Oh)
But then you go and put the in affection
And you could make me forget about, everything else

And I know that you can't hear me
But I think about you every day
And I have the shortest memory
But I can't forget the pain
That I felt when you when away, ooh

I can't have it both ways
I'm sorry that I said goodbye
People say I did the right thing
But they don't have to cry
I can love you for all the thing that you are
And then hate you for all the things that you're not
I want you to go, I want you to stay
But I can't have it both ways
No, I can't have it both ways

Hating, hate is overrated, baby
So are all the mistakes we make in life
Just to keep our pride
I can't have it both ways
I really want it that way
But I love it this way
I can't have it both ways
I can't have it both ways
I really want it
And I love you and hate you
You gone then you stay
I fight you tomorrow, but want you today
It's all the same, and I just can't have it both ways

I can't have it both ways (Oh)
I'm sorry that I said goodbye (I'm sorry that I said goodbye)
People say I did the right thing (Ooh)
But they don't have to cry (They don't have to cry)
I can love you for all the thing that you are
And then hate you for all the things that you're not
I want you to go, I want you to stay
But I can't have it both ways (Both ways)
N,o I can't have it both ways (I can't have it both ways)

Just can't have it
I can't have it both ways
Said I just can't have it, just can't have it
Just can't have it, just can't have it
No, I just can't have it, just can't have it
