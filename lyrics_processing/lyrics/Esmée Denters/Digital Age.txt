Growing up in the digital age
Hiding behind a screen
Instead of being face to face
Addicted to likes and views
It can be a dangerous game
It's so easy to lose yourself
When they've always got something to say

When we're not satisfied
Oh, we'll just put a filter on it
You know it ain't real life
When we only share the good moments
Is it really worth it, tryna be this perfect?
We are so much more then we could ever capture
With technology

So turn all your devices off
And maybe we could just talk
And spend our time like we used to do
Turn all your devices off
And maybe we could just talk
And spend our time like we used to do
You might also like
Instead of staring at our phones
Let's have a conversation
And cancel out all the noise
We don't need to try hard to fake it
Striving for the unattainable
When the flaws are what makes us beautiful
Start living in the moment
Stop trying to save it

When we're not satisfied
Oh, just put a filter on it
You know it ain't real life
When we only share the good moments
Is it really worth it, tryna be this perfect?
We are so much more then we could ever capture
With technology

So turn all your devices off
And maybe we could just talk
And spend our time like we used to do
Turn all your devices off
And maybe we could just talk
And spend our time like we used to do
If we are so connected, why do I feel so disconnected?
For a moment let's go back in time
Back to when we used to talk for hours
Felt like the world was ours
Let's just pretend it's you and I

So turn all your devices off
And maybe we could just talk
And spend our time like we used to do
Turn all your devices off
And maybe we could just talk
And spend our time like we used to do

So just talk to me
Remember how it used to be?
Won't you just talk to me
You remember how it used to be?
