Hmm

Before I met you, I didn't believe in love
The only thing I knew was a broken heart
I still remember the day that my parents broke up
My world was caving in, I swore that I'd never fall

Other lovers, they tried to change me
Treated me like I was a fool
I know that you'd never hurt me
Just love me the way that you do (do, do, do)

I don't have to worry 'bout
Where you go and where you've been
We got a different kinda love
And you don't ever give me drama
We don't ever play no games
We got a different kinda love

We got a different, different
We got a different kinda love
We got a different, different
We got a different kinda love
I ain't never felt like this before
We got a different kinda love
You might also like
We got inside jokes nobody understands
Oh, how you make me laugh, you really are my best friend
I wanna share my all that I have to give
So whenever you need me, I promise that I'll be here

I'm not scared to tell you my feelings
'Cause I know that you're feeling the same
I don't know if this is forever
But with you, I could spend everyday (day, day, day)

I don't have to worry 'bout
Where you go and where you've been
We got a different kinda love
And you don't ever give me drama
We don't ever play no games
We got a different kinda love

We got a different, different
We got a different kinda love
We got a different, different
We got a different kinda love
I ain't never felt like this before
We got a different kinda love
With you I can be myself, I don't need nobody else
I'll put my heart in your hands because you understand
And love me for who I am
And we don't have to fight, you are always on my side
You would never deceive me, I trust you completely
This is what it should be like

I'm not scared to tell you my feelings
'Cause I know that you're feeling the same
I don't know if this is forever
With you, I could spend everyday
I ain't never felt like this before
We got a different kinda love
We got a different kinda love

I don't have to worry 'bout
Where you go and where you've been
We got a different kinda love
And you don't ever give me drama
We don't ever play no games
We got a different kinda love
We got a different kinda love
We got a different, different
We got a different kinda love
We got a different, different
We got a different kinda love
I ain't never felt like this before
We got a different kinda love

Different kinda love (got a different kinda)
Different kinda love (got a different kinda)
Different kinda love (got a different kinda)
