Hold up, wait a minute, what I'm feeling now
My world's spinning around, got me freaking out
Hold up, wait a minute, you're my universe
Everything you say or do always seems to hurt
Eight hours, to the minute, since I left your place
You told me I should be thanking God that you came my way
Eight minutes to the second, since I realized
I know we aren't supposed to feel like this
And it's time that I...
Let go of all the things you've been calling me
Let go of all the pain and the memories
I ain't about to break my beginning
I'm starting now
And you showed me how

I don't need your love for charity (Charity)
Got everything I want in me (Want in me)
Open your eyes and you will see (You will see)
That I, I, that I, I
Ain't a victim (Ain't a victim), ain't a victim (Ain't a victim)
Are you listening? (Are you listening?)
Said I, I, said I, I
Ain't a victim, ain't a victim, ain't a victim, ooh
You might also like
Don't think I'll be giving any part of me
Anything that you ever had now is history
Don't blink 'cause you'll miss it
I'm Houdini, boy
I'll be slipping out of this change, you won't hear a noise
Let go of all the things you've been calling me
Goodbye to all the pain and the memories
I ain't about to break my beginning
I'm starting now
And you showed me how

I don't need your love for charity (Charity)
Got everything I want in me (Want in me)
Open your eyes and you will see (You will see)
That I, I, that I, I
Ain't a victim (Ain't a victim), ain't a victim (Ain't a victim)
Are you listening? (Are you listening?)
Said I, I, said I, I
Ain't a victim, ain't a victim, ooh

Oh my.. you're looking like a lonely guy
You just don't know where to turn
Oh my.. baby. don't cry watching the biggest part
Hold up, wait a minute, what I'm feeling now
My world's spinning around, got me freaking out
Hold up, wait a minute, you're my universe
Everything you say or do..
I don't need your love for charity (Charity)
Got everything I want in me (Want in me)
Open your eyes and you will see (You will see)
That I, I, that I, I
Ain't a victim (Ain't a victim), ain't a victim (Ain't a victim)
Are you listening? (Are you listening?)
Said I, I, said I, I
Ain't a victim (Ain't a victim), ain't a victim (Ain't a victim)
Are you listening? (Are you listening?)
Said I, I, said I, I
Ain't a victim (Ohh, I)
