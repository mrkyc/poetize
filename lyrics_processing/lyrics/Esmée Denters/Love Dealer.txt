Let's go
Baby, I gotta have some more (Turn the track up)
What's it gonna take to get a score? (Turn the beat up, yeah)
Got me like a fiend bangin' on your door (I think I want some of that)
Why don't you meet me on the floor?
And then...

Step into my office
Would you like to try a sample, a taste of my stuff? (Yeah, c'mon)
I've got a million different flavors
All the boys say they can't get enough (That's right)
Once I'm under your skin, you're begging me for more
You'll get addicted to this, but baby, you've been warned
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you when I'm on the floor
The floor, the floor

'Cause I could be your dealer
I can be your only friend when you meet her
I'll keep you comin' back again
You can call me anytime, I can make you feel fine
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix
Then I'm your dealer, hey
Love, love dealer, hey (Ch-check it out)

All those other pushers, they say they got that good stuff
But you already know (You already know what it is)
That they can't do what I do, oh no
I'll take you places you never thought you'd go (Uh, yeah, c'mon)
I can get you so high with the things I do
You get a rush in your veins when we start to move
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you when I'm on the floor
The floor, the floor (C'mon)

'Cause I could be your dealer
I can be your only friend when you need her
I'll keep you comin' back again
You can call me anytime, I can make you feel fine
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix
Then I'm your dealer, hey
Love love dealer, hey (C'mon)
You can call me anytime, I can make you feel fine
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix
Then I'm your dealer, hey (Dealer)
Love, love dealer, hey (Break it down)

Baby, I gotta have some more
Eyes roll back and you feel dizzy
What's it gonna take to get a score?
Now you got me in your system
Got me like a fiend bangin' on your door
So now you know what you've been missin'
Why don't you meet me on the floor?
And then, break
You ain't gotta say that you like it
I can tell by the look in your eyes
Won't you give it a try?
You'll be mine

'Cause I could be your dealer (Woo!)
I can be your only friend when you meet her (Uh, c'mon)
I'll keep you comin' back again

Then I'm your dealer, hey
Love love dealer, hey
Love love dealer (Sing it, girl), hey
Love love dealer (Get down girl), hey
