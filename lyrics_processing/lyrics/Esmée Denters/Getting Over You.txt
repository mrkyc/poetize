I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get over you
I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get over you
I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get over you
I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get, talk to 'em, girl

I was always the kind to keep it cool and all
They don't want to let you in, built up this wall around me
Never thought that I'd be in this position
But in the back of my mind, I knew this would happen
You overtook my door when I thought it was locked
I got scared when you stole the key to my heart
Got to convince myself, I don't need anyone
That's why I let you go, but I couldn't be more wrong

'Cause there's really no getting over you
Now I don't know what I'm supposed to do
'Cause the more I try, the more I can't let you go
I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get over you
I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get

Here we are, you was on, but I'm still stuck here
Another girl in your life, she's taking over
Everything that could have been mine
She is the one you're with, late at night
Now I realize, but it's too late
Boy, every time that I see your face
I don't know how much more my heart can take
'Cause I lost a good thing and let it go to waste
If I had a second chance, I'd never make the same mistake
You might also like
'Cause there's really no getting over you
Now I don't know what I'm supposed to do
'Cause the more I try, the more I can't let you go, no
Guess there's really no getting over you
I see your face and it breaks my heart in two
Though I'm crying inside, I try not to let it go

I'm looking in the mirror, but it's not me looking back
I am not gonna go see him
She would never let you go like that
When I had the chance, I guess I let you slip away
Now I've only got myself to blame
If I had a second chance
I'd never make the same mistake

'Cause there's really no getting over you
Now I don't know what I'm supposed to do
'Cause the more I try, the more I can't let you go, no
Guess there's really no getting over you
I see your face and it breaks my heart in two
Though I'm crying inside, I try not to let it go

I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get over you
I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get over you
I gotta get over, gotta, gotta get over you
