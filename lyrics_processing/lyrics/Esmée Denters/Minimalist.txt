I'd like to own a house one day with a garden
A place that we can call our own, live happily
Maybe we'll even have a car, drive to the ocean
So we can go anywhere we please

I like all of the clothes that I wear and the books that I read
So many things that I collected over the years
But if I had to choose between all I can see
Or what I feel for you
It would be so easy

Call me a minimalist
'Cause I don't need a lot of stuff
When it comes to you, darling, I could never get enough
So call me a minimalist
'Cause I don't need a lot of things
As long as I got you, I won't be missing anything (Missing anything)

No one knows what the future brings, it's uncertain
Never really knowing where it is we stand
The world can be a lonely place, so confusing
But when I'm in your arms, suddenly it makes sense
You might also like
There's not a single thing that could replace the way that you make me feel, no
There's no amount of money that can buy me a love that is this real
Now I know why they say the best things in life come for free
'Cause you're the only essential I need

So call me a minimalist (Call me, call me)
'Cause I don't need a lot of stuff (I don't need)
When it comes to you (When it comes to you), darling, I could never get enough (Never get enough)
So call me a minimalist (Call me, call me)
'Cause I don't need a lot of things (I don't need)
As long as I got you (As long as I got you), I won't be missing anything (Missing anything)

If tomorrow it all gets taken away (Away)
And everything changes, our love will remain

So call me a minimalist (Call me, call me)
'Cause I don't need a lot of stuff (I don't need)
When it comes to you (When it comes to you), darling, I could never, ever, ever get enough
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
So call me a minimalist (Minimalist)

'Cause out of all the places that I been
People that I've seen
I ain't ever met someone like you
Yeah, out of all the places that I've been
People that I've seen
