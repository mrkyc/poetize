It's Vedo, baby

In too deep, got you weak at the knees
Might not come to my senses in time, it's now or never, baby
Might put it all in the line
I thought I had my mind made up
Until I had your legs raised up
Music low with this liquor in my cup like
You make it hard for me
You know how to pull all my parts, you see
You know how I like it, mind control
I don't even wanna fight it
You gonna make me start a family
Make an honest woman out you, meet the family (Might risk it all)
Then wait on that late text, saying you're late text...

I don't wanna pull out, pull out
Pull out, baby
Don't make me pull out, pull out
Pull out, baby (Yeah)

Right now it's feeling like the best option
Can't let another nigga take my spot and
Lock you down, take what's mine, so
I go down, take my time (Ooh, whoa)
I taste your love, your overflow
Leave you with a piece of my soul
Judgment cloudy, so deep I can barely speak
The deeper that I sink, it makes it hard to think
I might risk it all and give you my all
And wait on that late text, saying you're late text...
You might also like
I don't wanna pull out, pull out
Pull out, baby
Don't make me pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out (Yeah)

Henny with your body, that's a cold combination
I got to slow it down, 'bout to cum, heart racing
I might risk it all and give you my all
And wait on that late text, saying you're late text...

Damn, I didn't pull out, pull out
Pull out
Damn, I didn't pull out, oh, oh, oh
