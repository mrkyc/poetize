Rock me, baby

2 AM, one thing on my mind
Candlelight, kissing you until our love combine
3 AM, now that we're aligned
Get you right, I'ma miss my flight if you stay the night
All alone, take it slow, feel my love below
Take my time loving you, feel your water flow
Lay your head upon my chest and feel my heart before we start

Girl, can you repeat, baby, rewind?
Slow it down, can we freeze time?
Fast forward, baby, track nine
Different position for every song I play
I know that this your favorite song
Girl, your body told me so
You don't have to say a word

Sex playlist (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
One hour and thirty minutes of showers
Girl, when I'm in it
With this sex playlist
A little bit of that, a little bit of this
A little bit of sweat, a little bit of silk
A little bit of Teddy
Girl, I hope you're ready
A little bit of G
Girl, what's in those jeans?
Trust me, I know just what to play
Enjoy my sex playlist
You might also like
Couldn't have been a more perfect time
For this song to come on
Girl, it won't be much longer
Sitting her watching you undress is satisfying
Girl, I'm not lying
Your body, babe
Got me hooked like I hit the weed
Next song is a mystery
Grabbin' the headboard, know my neighbors gon' be pissed at me
We'll go down in history
Oh, you say young boy ain't hittin' on shit (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well you ain't never met a real young G like this
Oh, you konw I know what you want

Girl, can you repeat, baby, rewind? (Oh, babe)
Slow it down, can we freeze time? (Oh, babe)
Fast forward, baby, track nine (Yeah, yeah)
Different position for every song I play (C'mon)
I know that this your favorite song
Girl, your body told me so (Oh)
You don't have to say a word, baby

Sex playlist (This sex playlist)
One hour and thirty minutes of showers

With this sex playlist (Oh yeah)
A little bit of that, a little bit of this (Oh no)
A little bit of sweat, a little bit of silk
A little bit of Teddy (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, baby)
Girl, I hope you're ready (C'mon, baby, show me now)
A little bit of G
Girl, what's in those jeans? (What's in those jeans?)
