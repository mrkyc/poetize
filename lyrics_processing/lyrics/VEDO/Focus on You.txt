Yeah, wow
Whoa-oh, yeah, yeah yeah
It's Vedo, baby

Thinking 'bout ways to make you mine
Followed your Instagram so I know you got time
See you been working, putting in overtime
I'm not tryin' to press you, but girl, you stay on my mind
Just being honest, I really want you, yeah
Talk to my conscience, no other options, yeah
Thinking 'bout the things I wanna do
You're all in my head, need you in my bed

I want your attention, I won't waste your time
Damn I love your accent, girl, say that one more time
Tell me where you're from, I think you're the one
Tell me what's your backstory? Why you so damn fine?
You're fine, fine

So much more potential in you (Oh-whoa-whoa)
I can only see me with you, (With you)
You're not that accessible (They can't get to you)
That's why I put my focus on you (You, you)
That's the type of shit I want (That's that shit)
Don't need no one to put you on (Oh-whoa)
You got something special, boo (So special, baby)
So I put my focus on you (Look)

See how you curve them niggas in your comments
If they get wrong, you can pop off too (Yeah)
Tunnel vision, I'll travel the distance
Girl, I'm incomplete, but you're the piece I'm missing, oh, whoa
