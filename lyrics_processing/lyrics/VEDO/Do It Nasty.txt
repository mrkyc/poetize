It's VEDO, baby
Hold up

Yeah I like when she get nasty
But I love when she keep it classy
Yeah she like when I get nasty
And I love when she call me daddy
She not shy
Yeah, she want it when she want i
Know she down to ride
Yes her favorite position is the peace sign
She be like, "Daddy, record it and rewind"
Then give me time

She gon' make a mess when I go down
So she get the best, plus she make me proud
She try not to scream and shout out loud
Make that sound, when you pull it out
I like it better when you

Do it nasty, do it, do it nasty
Do it nasty, she gon' do it nasty
Do it nasty, do it, do it nasty
Do it nasty, I like it better when you
Do it nasty, I'm your daddy
Call me daddy, messin' up the bedsheets
Do it nasty, do it, do it nasty
Do it nasty, I like it better when you
You might also like
Do it with no hands, when you in that stance
Girl, you ride it like a champ, got me making plans
I love it when you kiss it when you're done, done, uh
Make you feel it in your chest when I go un-under
Shawty, you the greatest, greatest
Muhammad Ali with the box, you drive a nigga crazy, crazy
Then you make it disappear, hocus pocus
You never lose your focus
If you keep going when I'm done
Fuck around, give you a son, oh

She gon' make a mess when I go down
So she get the best, plus she make me proud
She try not to scream and shout out loud
Make that sound, when you pull it out
I like it better when you

Do it nasty, do it, do it nasty
Do it nasty, she gon' do it nasty
Do it nasty, do it, do it nasty
Do it nasty, I like it better when you
Do it nasty, I'm your daddy
Call me daddy, messin' up the bedsheets
Do it nasty, do it, do it nasty
Do it nasty, I like it better when you
Do it nasty, I'm your daddy
Call me daddy, messin' up the bedsheets
