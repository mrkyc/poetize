Be careful what you aks for
I can be a lot more
I hide my pain behind these frames, but baby, you
I know you don't deserve that
I promise I'm worth it
Yeah I'm broken, but open, I'm hopeful to love again

Forgive me if I get too sentimental
Some things in my life have been instrumentals with me (Yeah)
I know I'm hard to love but if it's true, I can promise

Hold on to me never let go
Broken, but you give me hope, baby (Hope, baby)
Show me, show me you can love me slow
When you fall in love with my soul
My body will follow, I know, baby (I know, baby)
Can you control, babe? (Mm)

It ain't easy
Lovin' me, I be rude for no reason
Guess it's true that we're all missin' pieces
Up and down, out of love, ain't my season
Wait on it, pray on, stay on it, faith on it, I know
I learn from my mistake
But when I'm with you I feel a way, oh
You might also like
Forgive me if I get too sentimental
Some things in my life have been instrumentals with me (Yeah)
I know I'm hard to love but if you do, can you promise?

Hold on to me never let go
Broken, but you give me hope, baby (Hope, baby)
Show me, show me you can love me slow
When you fall in love with my soul
My body will follow, I know, baby (I know, baby)
Can you control, babe? (Mm, yeah)

Broken pieces
Make love to my soul, I need it (Yeah)
All the reasons
Slow it down if you climb, we'll reach it
Girl, if I give you my hand, gromise you'll lead me to the light
It feels so right, just don't play me close

Hold on to me never let go
Broken, but you give me hope, baby (Hope, baby)
Show me, show me you can love me slow
When you fall in love with my soul
My body will follow, I know, baby (I know, baby)
