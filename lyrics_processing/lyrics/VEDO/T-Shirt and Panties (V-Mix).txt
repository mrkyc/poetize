It's Vedo, baby

Just got out from work
Shawty hit my line
Says she's all alone
And I've been on her mind
She just got out the shower
Sippin on some wine
Said if I'm not busy
Can I come spend some time

So I hoped in the coupe
I hit the freeway
Then I hit that FaceTime
Like what you got on babe
I've had a long day
I'm so glad you called me
She say you don't have to worry 'bout my clothes

'Cause I got my t-shirt and my panties on
That's all I need to hear, she said
T-shirt and my panties on waiting for you
T-shirt and my panties on
Don't have to be naked just have T-shirt and your panties
Have T-shirt and your panties on
I'm on my way, girl don't you play
Don't be on that bullshit 'cause it's way too late
She said T-shirt and my panties on
Don't have to be naked just have
T-shirt and your panties
Have your T-shirt and your panties on
Look
That's how I like it
Waiting for you you you
Right now

I'm in the driveway
Unlock the door roll on the floor
Start in the hallway
You just don't know what you're in for
I'm off that henny so I know i'm hitting that, hitting that, hitting that tonight
You deserve rounds
I'm gonna repeat that, repeat that, repeat that tonight
I'm on a wave tonight
That kitty been on my hitlist
Not gonna play tonight
I've been put you on my wishlist
You gonna crown me king 'cause i'm gonna do everything
It ain't no limits when I'm in it
Pretty as a picture i'm staying in it

I hoped in the coupe
Then I hit the freeway
Then I hit that FaceTime like what you got on babe
I've had a long day
I'm so glad you called me
She said you don't have to worry 'bout my clothes

'Cause I got my t-shirt and my panties on
That's all I need to hear, she said
T-shirt and my panties on waiting for you
T-shirt and my panties on
T-shirt and your panties have your
T-shirt and your panties on
I'm on my way, girl don't you play
Don't you be on that bullshit because it's way too late
She said T-shirt and my panties on
Don't have to be naked just have
T-shirt and your panties have your
T-shirt and your panties on
That's how I like it
Waiting for you, you, you
