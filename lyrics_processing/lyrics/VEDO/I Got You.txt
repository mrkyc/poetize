Yeah, yeah, do yourself a favor
Put you in my phone, shawty, text a nigga later
Know I got the wave right now
Know you tired of being played by now
You the greatest and you winning, baby
Never let a hater tell you different
You gon' make me pull up on that nigga with the issue
Know you got a ways to go, but girl, I'm with you
No jumpin' ship, if you sink, then we gon' swim, let me know

'Cause baby, I, I see so much inside you
Ain't no rush, I got time
Fight that war right beside you, I got you
I don't mind
You get lost I come find you
Ride for you, I do time
You gotta look out for you
I think that it's time, girl, I got you

You know that I got you
It tok me so long just to find you, yeah
I knew there was something about you
Tell me when that other nigga left
'Cause I know you best
I know your problems
Don't mind me, I just sit and solve 'em
Why you so stressed?
Baby, just calm down
I want you to have it all
