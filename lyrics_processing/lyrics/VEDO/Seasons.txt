Yeah
Everybody got they season
You gotta wait on it
Vedo, baby
(Rock me, baby
Well, how do you like it?)

Girl, tie up your hair
Need no makeup on
Girl, I need you bare
Stripped down to your soul
Need no distractions
You've had too much of that
Tryna see where your mental's at
I know you're special, you're just damaged
Just hold on tight, girl, you can manage
Help you understand it (Oh)

That if a flower doesn't bloom in the sun, doesn't mean let it go (No, no)
'Cause when it rains outside and it's all said and done, you will grow, this I know

It ain't your season
Just give it time to grow
Let me work on your soul
Don't be closed minded
No, it ain't your season
Wait for it, don't let go
Just focus on the grow
Got your back, you know
Whatever you need, just know that I got you
Girl, we're a team, won't let nothing get past you
I'm here, shawty
We all got problems, baby, you're not alone
But you got to be patient and let your flower bloom
Wait on your season
You might also like
Protect your investment, learn from that lesson, wait on your blessing
Remember mistakes that you made in the past but don't let it affect you now
It's been a while, while
But I got you now, now
I won't let you drown, drown
Pick up when you're lacking, girl, I got it
Chin up, I got your back, no lookin' back
Pin you to the mattress while I explore all your magic
Girl, your past is why you made it
Shawty, don't be scared to face it on your own
And in case you didn't know

That if a flower doesn't bloom in the sun, doesn't mean let it go (Oh, wait on your blessing girl, no)
'Cause when it rains outside and it's all said and done, you will grow, this I know

It ain't your season
Just give it time to grow
Let me work on your soul
Don't be closed minded
No, it ain't your season
Wait for it, don't let go
Just focus on the grow
Got your back, you know
Whatever you need, just know that I got you
Girl, we're a team, won't let nothing get past you
I'm here, shawty
We all got problems, baby, you're not alone
But you got to be patient and let your flower bloom
