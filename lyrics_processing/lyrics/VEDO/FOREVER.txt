Yeah
It's VEDO, baby

Times are crazy
But your lovin' doesn't feel that way
I'm glad you made it, love
Together, I don't feel the pain, oh-woah
I don't think it's wise
To confide in someone who ain't true
And you ain't gotta lie
I know the world is comin' down on you too (Yeah)

I don't mind bein' used as a place to escape to (Yeah)
Now I know there is love after pain and you're the proof
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Let's make it forever, girl
Not just for this moment
I'll be yours forever, girl
Say yes and we can own it
You have all the leverage, girl
I'm yours if you want it
Let's make it forever, girl (Yeah)
