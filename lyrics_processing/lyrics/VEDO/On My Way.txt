I can't wait
You
It's Vedo, baby
Yeah

I'm on my way, hop on the plane
Girl, I've been missing your body
What you got on, send me a picture show me what I'm missing
Don't hide it, girl you the one
I miss when I kiss it and you get submissive girl
It ain't no fun
If I cannot touch it and leave a few hickies girl
I can't lie, girl, I miss your vibe
All between your thighs
Waking up with you by my side (My side)
I miss that breakfast in the morning
Your conversation keep me going
I can't wait to get back to you
Can't wait to go in my bag for you

It's been way too long, way too long
Just make sure you're home, sure you're home (I'm on my way back to you)
You should come and ride my wave
Cancel your plans a couple days
You might also like
Girl lets roll one, girl lets pour up
We got a vibe, you know what it is
As soon as I show up
Real nigga you got one
Girl don't slow up
Talking that shit all in my ear
Gon' make you a momma

Come get this blessing
Kissing all over your neck and girl I can't front you the best
I did find me a wife and my best friend
I'ma do the most baby when I pull up
Shawty you the G.O.A.T
You ain't got to prove nothing
Waiting all day girl I need your lovin'
When I call pick up
You, I can't wait to get next to you
I've been all in my bag all day
'Cause I miss all that freaky shit you do
I'm on my way girl I won't be long
Oh, oh baby I can't wait no more, oh, oh

It's been way too long, way too long
Just make sure you're home, sure you're home (I'm on my way back to you)
You should come and ride my wave
Cancel your plans a couple days
Girl lets roll one (Girl lets roll one), girl lets pour up (Girl lets pour up)
We got a vibe, you know what it is (You know what it is)
Soon as I show up (Soon as I show up)
Real nigga you got one (Real nigga you got one)
Girl don't slow up
Talking that shit all in my ear
Gonna make you a momma
Girl lets roll one, girl lets pour up
We got a vibe, you know what it is
Soon as I show up
Real nigga you got one
Girl don't slow up
Talking that shit all in my ear
