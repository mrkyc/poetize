Bitter
Mad at you, mad I'm your nigga

Fuck nigga get out of your feelings
You had her first but I'm realer

So nigga if you with it me too
You had your chance
Nigga move
Don't get gassed up by your crew
So bitter, she got a real nigga with her, oh no
I gave her some, she wasn't feeling with you
What you gave her, now she ain't healing (It's true)
I told her don't trip when you see him
Don't give him no energy
I told her don't trip, give it back to 'em, aye
Don't leave him thinking you attached to him, whoa
That nigga goofy, he a cartoon
And I'm here to stay like a tattoo
He thought he had you stuck
When you let that nigga fuck
So he keep on poping up (Poping up)
Said she didn't even came

Tongue in her mouth, all in her story, ain't no croping out
Steady looking for attention
Nigga should've payed attention (Attention, attention)
Yeah, I hear niggas talking but whatever they say ain't about shit
Oh no no noo

Just because y'all got a past it don't mean y'all got a future
