Shoo Ba Dee Do Baby
Shoo Ba Dee Do
Oh Naa Na Na
Its Vedo baby ....
(Verse 1)
Girl I can't front you know I'm selfish
I want it all don't wanna share it
I'm leaving hickies I can't help it
Can't let no other niggas beat me to it
Love when you got your hair tied in a ponytail
Love when you wear them sweatpants wit no underwear
Can't wait to meet yo mama and say thank you for your daughter
Hope you not thinking that I'm all for myself cause I'm selfish
When it comes to you(x2)
I could be selfish you know I can't help it baby
Oh oh
(Chorus)
Don't give it to nobody babe You know can't nobody do you like you like I do
You know I got my selfish ways
That's why I do your body like I do
Selfish, When it comes to you (x2)
Selfish ... Oh ho ho ho

Look girl I can't lie
Know I get jealous whenever you don't reply
Baby forgive me I just hate saying goodbye
(I just want you all to myself)
I don't need nothing else
Love when you got your hair tied in a ponytail
Love when you wear them sweatpants wit no underwear
Can't wait to meet yo mama my future baby mama
Hope you not thinking that I'm all to myself
Cause I'm selfish
When it comes to you(x2)
I can be selfish you know I can't help it
Oh Oh
(Chorus)
Don't give it to nobody babe (Don't give it to nobody babe)
You know can't nobody do you like I do (Oh yeah yeah)
