But now I'm gonna forget all about her, oh, oh
So she can't keep pulling me through hell
I can't believe I ever said I loved her
It took me so long just to see
But now I'm gonna listen to my mother, oh, oh
She is always looking out for me
I'm on my way to learning, I'm a better me
Without you, I was better off
Is one enough to my mama told me don't settle for less
She was right about all the rest
Mama knows best
(Yeah, she knows, yeah, she knows)
Whatever she says
(Yeah, she knows, yeah, she knows)
She could've just left but she knows
Yeah, she knows, yeah, she knows
I gotta confess
That mama knows best
I can't believe I ever said I loved her
It took me so long just to see
But now I'm gonna listen to my mother, oh, oh
She is always looking out for me
