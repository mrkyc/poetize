Tonight I believe that you are the reason I dream
Wrapped up in sheets, I'm wrapped up in everything
But here comes the light, stealing me back from you
Leaving the night, leaving me so confused

I'm wide awake,I'm wide awake

Cause I wanna close my eyes and sleep
Run to the place we used to meet
Cause I'd rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you
Cause I'd sleep forever if you leave
Give up the world so you would see
That I'd rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you, without you

Come to my dreams and daylight won't find us here
We're finally free, free to go anywhere
So give me the strength, strength just to say goodbye
Goodbye to the world, the world we could leave behind

I'm wide awake,I'm wide awake

Cause I wanna close my eyes and sleep
Run to the place we used to meet
Cause I'd rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you
Cause I'd sleep forever if you leave
Give up the world so you would see
That I'd rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you, without you

Don't give up, I'll never let you
Don't give up, I'll never let you
Don't give up, I'll never let you go
Don't give up, I'll never let you
Don't give up, I'll never let you
Don't give up, I'll never let you go

I wanna close my eyes and sleep
Run to the place we used to meet
Cause I'd rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you
Cause I'd sleep forever if you leave
Give up the world so you would see
That I'd rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you, without you
Without you, without you
