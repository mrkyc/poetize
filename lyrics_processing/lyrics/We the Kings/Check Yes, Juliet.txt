Check yes, Juliet, are you with me?
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
I won't go until you come outside
Check yes, Juliet, kill the limbo
I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
There's no turning back for us tonight

Lace up your shoes (Ayo, ayo)
Here's how we do

Run, baby run, don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance (Give them the chance)
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run, baby run, forever we'll be
You and me

Check yes, Juliet, I'll be waiting
Wishing, wanting yours for the taking
Just sneak out and don't tell a soul goodbye
Check yes, Juliet, here's the countdown:
Three, two, one, now fall in my arms now
They can change the locks, don't let them change your mind

Here's how we do

Run baby run, don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance (Give them the chance)
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run baby run, forever we'll be
You and me

We're flying through the night, we're flying through the night
Way up high
The view from here is getting better with you by my side

Run baby run, don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run baby run, forever we'll be
Run baby run, don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance (Give them the chance)
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run baby run, forever we'll be
You and me
