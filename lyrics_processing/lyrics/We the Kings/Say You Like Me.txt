She's the girl that no one ever knows
And I say hi, but she's too shy to say hello
She's just waiting for that one to take her hand
And shake her up, I bet I could
I wish my heart was always on her mind
'Cause she's on mine like all day, all the time, yeah
Forget me not, forget me now
I've come too far to turn around
I'm here tonight

'Cause I'm never going down
I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave
So put your hands up
If you like me
Then say you like me
I'm never going down
I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave
So put your hands up
If you like me
Then say you like me

She's the girl that no one ever knows
Works a double just to buy her clothes
Nicotine and faded dreams
Baby, just believe
There's no one else like me

'Cause I'm never going down
I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave
So put your hands up
If you like me
Then say you like me
I'm never going down
I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave
So put your hands up
If you like me
Then say you like me
Woah, oh, oh, oh

It's time to fall into my arms
'Cause I've been waiting for too long
You're an angel
Grab your halo
And let's fly tonight

'Cause I'm never going down
I'm never giving up
I'm never gonna leave
So put your hands up
If you like me
Then say you like me
'Cause I'm never going down
I'm never giving up
