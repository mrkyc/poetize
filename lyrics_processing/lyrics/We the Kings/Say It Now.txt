And tired eyes just lay your head on me
And I'll be here until you fall asleep
The storm is getting closer, I won't leave
All the words I sing are whispers in your dreams

When I said I wanted it all, I wanted it all
It hurts more than ever, I won't give up now
And all that you are, is all that I need
I promised forever

So tell me it hurts, tell it burns
Tell me it's love and that you're ready to fall
Into my arms or into the ground
It's lost or it's found
Whatever you need to say
Say it now
Say it now
Say it now

Clouds are clearing up, I see the stars
Like underneath your pain, I see your heart
Laying hand and hand beneath the sky, forget the world
It's only you and I

When we said we wanted it all, we wanted it all
It hurts more than ever, we can't give up now
And all that we are, is all that we need
We promised forever

So tell me it hurts, tell it burns
Tell me it's love and that you're ready to fall
Into my arms or into the ground
It's lost or it's found
Whatever you need to say
Say it now
Say it now

Say it, tell me that you love me
Say you want to leave me
Tell me that you need me
Say it like you mean it
You know that I can take it
You that it won't break me
I just wanna know

So tell me it hurts, tell it burns
Tell me it's love and that you're ready to fall
Into my arms or into the ground
It's lost or it's found
Whatever you need to say
Say it now
Say it now
Say it now
Say it now
