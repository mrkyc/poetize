Woah, alright, now everybody hit it
Woah

You can bring me down, ay
But it'll take a whole lot more
To keep me down, ay
'Cause I've been here before
Yeah, I'm a regular
And nothing you can say to me's original, ay, yeah

Whether I stay or whether I go
I still got my mind, I still got control
I feel it sometimes
I feel like I'm more
Like the end of the line is the end of the road
When everything stops, gimme the go
I turn up the heat, never turning too cold
I give it my all with my heart and my soul
And I never take silver, I only take gold

I'm alive for a reason
Should have died
But I'm breathing
I'm alive for a reason
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Alive for a reason
I won't die, I'm believing
Yeah, I'm alive for a reason
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Second chance, ay
And every single moment I am living in, ay
The air that I am breathing isn't permanent, ay
There must be something here I haven't finished yet, ay, yeah

Whether I stay or whether I go
I still got my mind, I still got control
I feel it sometimes
I feel like I'm more
Like the end of the line is the end of the road
When everything stops, gimme the go
I turn up the heat, never turning too cold
I give you my all with my heart and my soul
And I won't quit at silver so gimme the gold

I'm alive for a reason
Should have died
But I'm breathing
I'm alive for a reason
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Alive for a reason
I won't die, I'm believing
Yeah, I'm alive for a reason
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Woah, woah
And I'm alive for a reason
And I won't die, I'm believing
That I'm alive for a reason
Tonight, tonight, tonight

I'm alive for a reason
Should have died
But I'm breathing
Yeah, I'm alive for a reason
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
