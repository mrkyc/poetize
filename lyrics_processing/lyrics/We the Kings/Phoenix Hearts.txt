Into the night
We hold our breath
Waiting for the sign
So take my hand
And close your eyes
There's nothing left to hide

And oh, our angels soar
Ready for war
My heart is yours
Lead this march for more
The arrow flies
Our eagle dies
But our voices rise

Let's chase the sun into its grave
Our phoenix hearts are rising in flames
Let's race the stars across the sky
And burn our names into the night
Let's light up the night
Let's light up the night
Let's light up the night
Let's light up the night

Of broken dreams
Looking for the light
We glue our bones
And find our hope

And oh, our angels soar
Ready for war
My heart is yours
Lead this march for more
The arrow flies
Our eagle dies
But our voices rise

Our phoenix hearts are rising in flames
Let's race the stars across the sky
And burn our names into the night

You're a fighter, you know who you are, you won't run away
So don't run away
You are brave and you know you can take it
Don't run away, so don't run away
If you fall I will be there to catch you
And I will wait, yeah I will wait
Can't you see that it's me?
I'm the one that you will save
And I will save you too
Yeah I will save you too
I will save you
