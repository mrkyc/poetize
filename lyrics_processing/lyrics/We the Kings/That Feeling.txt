You wanna record me singing?
Yeah
Ahem, um, okay, what do you want me to sing?
Just sing anything like, whoo whoo whoo
Whoo whoo whoo, like this?

The morning light opened my eyes
I feel the storm from a crazy night
Can't find my keys, I feel so lost
So show me what I've been looking for
I've done everything, opened every door
Then what I thought I'd never find was staring in my eyes

I'm like, oh my god, is this real?
All the feelings I feel, my heart she surely will steal
And this is so surreal, so I dive in like head first
I'll take your best and your worst to feel my heartbeat burst

When I'm with you I feel like I could be dreaming
So kiss me goodnight
When I'm with you I feel like I could be floating
So come get me high
Even when there's nothing left to lose, I always escape to you
You've got the thing I was missing when I'm with you
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling

She wakes up cold in her lonely bed
She feels the storm up inside her head
She finds her keys, they're never lost
She drives away praying to her god
Just to help her see her way through the dark
Then what she thought she'd never find was staring in her eyes

She's like, oh my god, is this real?
All the feelings I feel, my heart he surely will steal
And this is so surreal, so I dive in like head first
I'll take your best and your worst to feel my heartbeat burst

When I'm with you I feel like I could be dreaming
So kiss me goodnight
When I'm with you I feel like I could be floating
So come get me high
Even when there's nothing left to lose, I always escape to you
You've got the thing I was missing when I'm with you
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
Is this just fantasy or is it something real?
Is this what's happening? I really hope this is love, love
So would you feel the same or would you walk away?
And would you ever say that you feel like it is love, love?

When I'm with you I feel like I could be dreaming
So kiss me goodnight
When I'm with you I feel like I could be floating
So come get me high
Even when there's nothing left to lose, I always escape to you
You've got the thing I was missing when I'm with you
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
I always get that feeling, feeling, feeling
