I'm all alone, holding on to memories while you're moving on
Let me take you back to when we first said goodbye
Cause I need you
I try because all that I can do is hope that love's enough
To pull you close enough to hold you
I'll close my eyes and I see you

Even when the sky falls and I've lost it all
I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I'll keep looking cause
I know I will find you there
You know I will find you, I'll find you, I will find you there
You know I will find you, I'll find you, I will find you there

So tell me why, why you want a world between us
Let me try I know you know this time I mean it
Say you still care and you need me
So where'd you go?
Something in your voice, it says you're not alone
Do you remember when I said I'd always be there?
Believe me

Even when the sky falls and I've lost it all
I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I'll keep looking cause
I know I will find you there
You know I will find you, I'll find you, I will find you there
You know I will find you, I'll find you, I will find you there
