I don't know who you are tonight
A million miles in between your kiss and mine
Alien are you in my life, at all?
And what's a story without an end?
A thousand memories we made just to forget
Will I ever see you again, my alien?

Without you
I howl at the moon

'Cause you were always the one with the fire
You were always the one who got higher
You were always the one, you were always the one
You were always the one with the fire
You were always the one who got higher
You were always the one, you were always the one

Fell so hard when you hit the ground
When the weight of the world just pulled you down
I wanna see you remember how to live again

Without you
I howl at the moon

'Cause you were always the one with the fire
You were always the one who got higher
You were always the one, you were always the one
You were always the one with the fire
You were always the one who got higher
You were always the one, you were always the one

So show me that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Show me that fire, fire, fire, fire
Show me that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Show me that fire, fire, fire, fire, oh
So let it burn, light it up for you and I
Let it burn, light it up and watch it die
Let it burn, light it up for one more time

'Cause you were always the one with the fire
You were always the one who got higher
You were always the one, you were always the one
You were always the one with the fire
You were always the one who got higher
You were always the one, you were always the one

So show me that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Show me that fire, fire, fire, fire
Show me that fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
