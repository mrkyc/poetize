Tattoo our sweat in tears
Forever you and I
Hold your breath till we cross the sundown
This is the moment
Time is racing slow it down
Cause you, a feeling i can't deny
We are only here for one more night
So scream it like you mean it
One more time
We'll tear down the building
Come on come on
Sing along whoa
Come on come on
Stay young
Let's light the kerosene tonight
Spark up like fireworks
Exploding in the sky
Kick down the new year and the future
We can't get closer here
The walls are falling down
Cause you, a feeling i can't deny
