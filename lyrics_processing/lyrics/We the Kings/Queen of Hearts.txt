When the world falls into pieces
You'll be the one voice of reason
When I can't face all my demons
You are the one I believe in
Through the thunder and the rain
Together we fall, together we fly away
Hold me closely
You are my one and only

You're the Queen of hearts, make me your king
You'll be the diamond, I got the ring
We could rule the world, own everything
I'll be the Jay-Z, you'll be the Bey

'Cause you've got me upside down
I know you inside out
They'll call me crazy, but baby you saved me
Can't you see?

When the world falls into pieces
You'll be the one voice of reason
When I can't face all my demons
You are the one I believe in
Through the thunder and the rain
Together we fall, together we fly away
Hold me closely
You are my one and only

You're Mona Lisa, I'm da Vinci
The smile on your face is all that I need
You could be my wild, I'd be your west
You know that I'd be your bulletproof vest

'Cause I've got you upside down
You got me completely inside inside out
They'll call me crazy, but baby you saved me
Can't you see?

When the world falls into pieces
You'll be the one voice of reason
When I can't face all my demons
You are the one I believe in
Through the thunder and the rain
Together we fall together we fly away
Hold me closely
You are my one and only
Oh oh oh oh oh
One and only
Oh oh oh oh oh
You are my one and only

You're everywhere I want to be
Even when you're far from me
I still hold you closer than you know
Well, even if you wanna leave
I'd let you take that part of me
I know that it would kill me but I'd swear I'd let you go

When the world falls into pieces
You'll be the one voice of reason
When I can't face all my demons
You are the one I believe in
Through the thunder and the rain
Together we fall, together we fly away
Hold me closely
You are my one and only

Oh oh oh oh oh
One and only
Oh oh oh oh oh
You are my one and only
