I'm gonna plug it in

I need somebody, need somebody
Need somebody to pick me up
And no one to let me down
I need something different
Someone, somewhere, and somehow
I need my world just to open up
I need just to find my way
Cause now or never
Never means that it's too late

And maybe it's not that far
And maybe it's not that hard
Maybe we're close to finding out who we are
Maybe it's the world apart
Maybe it's straight up in the stars
I don't care how far
They have planes, trains, & cars
That'll get me where I'm going

I need a reason, need a reason
Need a reason for waking up
Need a reason for getting out
Need a reason to pull the sheets right up instead of down
I need my eyes just to open up
To see that it's not a race
Cause now or never
Never means that it's too late

And maybe it's not that far
And maybe it's not that hard
Maybe we're close to finding out who we are
Maybe it's the world apart
Maybe it's straight up in the stars
I don't care how far
They have planes, trains, & cars
That can get me where I'm going

Every heart-heart beat-beats on its own
I used to, used to, used to hate it
Now I call it home
I call it home
And every heart-heart beat-beats on its own
I used to, used to, used to hate it
Now I call it home
I call it home
And every heart-heart beat-beats on its own
I used to, used to, used to hate it
Now I call it home
I call it home
And every heart-heart beat-beats on its own
I used to, used to, used to hate it
Now I call it home
I call it home
And maybe it's not that far
And maybe it's not that hard
Maybe we're close to finding out who we are
Maybe it's the world apart
Maybe it's straight up in the stars
I don't care how far
They have planes, trains, & cars
That can get me where I'm going
That can get me where I'm going
That can get me where I'm going
I don't care how far
They have planes, trains, & cars
