'Cause even when your fire burns out
And the stars in the sky fall down
And the world starts turning us round
You and I are immortal
I know one day everything stops
But we can beat the fate of our odds
And we can change the words in our stars
'Cause you and I are immortal, yeah

No one seems to talk about it
I know that it's hard, I get it
But sometimes I just need to hear it
Then I could wrap my head around it
The voices keep me up at night
The mystery is worse than dying
It's worse, it's worse

In my head it sounds worse to me
Like every little thing is a catastrophe
I wish I never looked online to see
I woulda processed this a little differently
I would said things different, not stayed so distant
Sat and listened, not hid in the kitchen
Hugged and kissed her, loved and whispered
Nothing I can say but damn, I miss her
Afraid to see and afraid to not
Afraid to lose and afraid to stop
I was afraid to see this face to face
Afraid to wait, to waste away the time, I
God forgive me, my greatest sin
I couldn't say goodbye, I couldn't save the end
I know we will meet again

And the more that I think about it
The harder now to talk about it
I'm old enough to understand it
But lucky for the thirty-six that you have prisoned
It's too late in the game for byes
You shoulda played it when you had the chance
One day we will meet again
