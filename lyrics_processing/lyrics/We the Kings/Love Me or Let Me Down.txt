I've been in my car outside your place
With a dozen roses in a vase
And a diamond ring inside a case
I haven't slept for three whole days
Rehearsing everything I'd say
So why in the hell am I so afraid?

If only I could just read your cursive mind
And know what you're thinking
Know what you're needing
I can try by just guessing what's inside
But it's never that easy
So please come and tell me

Are you in or are you out?
Are you still searching for something you just haven't found?
I know it's hard for you, but it's killing me right now
So will you love me or let me down?

A couple months have passed away
I've seen you every single day
But the ring's still hiding in its case
A moment's all that it would take
To turn my fear right into faith
So why in the hell am I so afraid?

Are you in or are you out?

I know it's hard for you, but it's killing me right now
So will you love me or let me down?

This is it, I made up my mind
I can't live holding this inside
I grab my keys and I start to drive
The whole way there, I don't think twice
My love is yours if you'll take mine
I stop the car and I close my eyes

Walking up the driveway to your place
Holding the ring without a case
I can feel my heart begin to race
You open the door with a smiling face
Before I speak, you tell me, "Wait"
You take my hand so you feel safe
And then you say
Are you in or are you out?
From the first kiss, I always knew just what I found
I know it took some time, but this is me right now
So will you love me or let me down?
Baby, love me or let me down
