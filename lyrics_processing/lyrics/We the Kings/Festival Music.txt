I met this girl, said she was from LA
I love the beach, my heart is on the page
We got to talking, yeah, she couldn't feel her face
Festival music, she's finally out her cage

She pulled me close, she had something for me
I loved the taste, I felt it take over me
We started dancin', yeah, I couldn't feel my feet
Festival music, yeah, right now, it's all I need
3 stages, 2 days and a few friends
We've waited too long for this weekend

(Whoa, whoa)
And I feel alive (Whoa)
'Cause I feel alive (Whoa)

And if I say what I thought, I would never hold you
Got a cut off shirt slipping off your shoulder
Ripped jeans make ya dance just a little bit lower
Makeup on your face to look a little bit older
Hey, come on, girl, you know I don't need a minute
You know it really gets good when we really get in it
You wanna take it too fast, but you'd never admit it
You wanna take it all back, but you already did it, ay

I met this girl, we snuck right on the stage
We lost our friends somewhere inside the haze
We started laughing, though, the nights turned into days
Festival music, yeah, we're finally out the cage
