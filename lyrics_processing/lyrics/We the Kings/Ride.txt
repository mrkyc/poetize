One day I'll figure it out but for now I'll just ride

And I don't need no one to tell me who I am
'Cause I've spent way too much time on them
I'm just tryin' to be me, I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm jus tryin' to be me, I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

I feel like I'm tearing myself in two different directions and I
Feel like I'm losing myself through the open incisions and I
I know that I don't always make all the best of decisions but I
I love the ride

So come on, let's ride
So come on, let's ride
So come on, let's ride
So come on, let's ride
One day I'll figure it out but for now I'll just ride
One day I'll figure it out but for now I'll just

I don't need no one to tell me who I am
'Cause I've spent way too long, wasting my time on them
I'm just tryin' to be me, I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm jus tryin' to be me, I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
