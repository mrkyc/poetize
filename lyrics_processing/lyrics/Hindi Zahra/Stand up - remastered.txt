Tell me what do you need
Oh, stand up on your two feet baby
That's how it's got to be
You want me to be your mother
But you know too young, too young
You want me to be your sister
But your know I'm too old,too old
You think I'm gonna rise you like a kid
But it don't matter the love I feel
It's time to show a proof,men got a move
Do what you gotta do, do what you gotta do
So
Stand in on your two knees baby
Tell me what do you need
Oh oh
Stand up on your two feet baby
It's how it's got to be
No no no no
Stand in on your two knees baby
Tell me what do you need
Humm hummm
Stand up on your two feet baby
It's how it's got to be
Man I love you and I just want to be your woman
Your woman
But I'm tired of your traveling ends
You played me for a fool
Thinking I don't know what to do
And noohoo
Hanging out in the clubs with your fake ass crew
Stand in on your two knees baby
Tell me what do you need
Oh, stand up on your two feet baby
It's how it's got to be
Stand in on your two knees baby
Tell me what do you need
Oh, stand up on your two feet baby
It's how it's got to be
Stand up, baby, stand up
You've got to you've got to you've got to stand up
Baby, stand up
Stand in on your two knees baby
Tell me what do you need
Oh, stand up on your two feet baby
It's how it's got to be
Stand up, baby, stand up
You've got to you've got to you've got to stand up
Stand up, baby, stand up
You've got to you've got to you've got to stand up
You've got to rise your hands to the sky
See the love, in your eyes
You've got to make a move, you've got to make it through
You've got to feel real of yourself
You've got to make a move
Stand up (stand up)
Baby (baby)
You've got, you've got, you've got to stand up
Baby, stand up
