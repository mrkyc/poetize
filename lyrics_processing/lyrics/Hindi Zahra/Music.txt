Music is coming now
Feel it dropping to the ground
Sounds like my heart beating
Fast and free now
It's always running in my veins
Till I hear the drums and basses all night
Music is coming now
See it everybody moves
Till we get thirsty and happy
All we need this time
For the real thing
For the real high for the real love
Come together now
And rock the ground
Give it all to the sound
Body soul and mind
Until you get down
Now I know what you're longing for
What you're waiting for
For the right time for the real thing

Move until you feel it
And move until you feel
Move until you feel it
And move until you feel
Move until you feel it
And move until you feel
Move until you feel it
And move until you feel
You might also like
There's no limit no rules
Between you and that
There's no lines no lights
So keep it alive keep it high
And make it yours
And rock the ground one, two times
Rock the ground
And give it all to the sound
Your body and your soul, your mind
And get free now
For the real thing, for the real high
For the real love
You better, better, better, better now
Rock the ground one two times
Until you feel it
Rock the ground one two times
Until you feel it for the real thing
For the real love, for the real high

Move until you feel it
And move until you feel
Move until you feel it
And move until you feel
Move until you feel it
And move until you feel
Move until you feel it
And move until you feel
Freedom is one way road
Freedom is one way road
Freedom is one way road
Freedom is one way road
Freedom is one way road

Until you get there
