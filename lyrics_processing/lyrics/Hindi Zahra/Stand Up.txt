Standing on your two knees, baby
Tell me what do you need
Stand up on your two feet, baby
That's how it's got to be

You want me to be your mother
But you know I'm too young, too young
You want me to be your sister
But you know I'm too old, too old
You think I'm gonna raise you like a kid
But it don't matter the love I feel, no no
It's time to show and prove, man, go  move
Do what you gotta do, do what you gotta do so

Standing on your two knees, baby
Tell me what do you need, c'mon
Stand up on your two feet, baby
That's how it's got to be

Standing on your two knees, baby
Tell me what do you need, oh
Stand up on your two feet, baby
That's how it's got to be
You might also like
Man, I love you and I
Just want to be your woman
But I'm tired of your trifling ass
You play me for a fool
Thinking I, I don't know what to do
I don't know what you do
Hanging out in the clubs
With your fake-ass crew, so

Standing on your two knees, baby
Tell me what do you need, c'mon
Stand up on your two feet, baby
That's how it's got to be

Standing on your two knees, baby
Tell me what do you need
Stand up on your two feet, baby
That's how it's got to be

Raise your head to the sky
You got to be real with yourself
Cause you know why
You've got to stand up
You've got to stand up
You've got to stand up
You've got to, you've got to
You've got to stand up
You've got to stand up
Stand up
You've got to stand up

Standing on your two knees, baby
Tell me what do you need
(Oh, stand up)
Stand up on your two feet, baby
(You've got to stand up)
That's how it's got to be

Standing on your two knees, baby
Tell me what do you need
(You know, you better raise)
(You better raise your head)
Stand up on your two feet, baby
That's how it's got to be

You know you got to
You know you got to
You know you got to
To raise your head
You got to, you got to
You got to raise your head
Stand up on your two feet
You got to stand up on
Stand up on your two feet
You got to stand up
