Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Ah

I was born in the desert, May
17 in '73
When the needle hit the groove, I commenced a-movin'
I was chasing what's callin' me

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
One foot in the gutter, one in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on
(And on, yeah)

Life is hard, that's why no one survives
I'm much older than I thought I'd be
Feel like a fool, yeah, like a dancin' fool, yeah
Footloose and fancy free

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Stand in the gutter, but my head's in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on (Hey!)


Push myself, the breaking point
It's all I know to do except for lie
I chase brake lights and dust ad nauseam
Driven by feelings I cannot hide
To be so civilized, one must tell civil lies
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on, yeah
(Oh)

Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with an urgency
Between pleasure and agony, on a one-way line
That's the sound that's callin' me
It's callin' me, it's callin' me
It's callin' me, it's callin' me
It's callin' me, it's callin' me
It's callin' me, it's callin' me
It's
Time to go, regret it later
We're gon' take it as it comes
Future tense meets middle finger
We take the long way home

Oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Do what you gotta do, oh, do it now
Feet don't fail me now
