Calling all comas
Prisoner on the loose; description
The spitting image of me
Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake and tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prisoner of sleep, deeper down
The rabbit hole, never to be found
Again, mmm-ah
(Ah-ah-ah)

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone; feelings
Raw and exposed when I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
Or dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in as I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole, never to be found

It's only fallin' in love because you hit the ground


Dancin' on wire, both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
The deeper asleep, the further down
The rabbit hole never to be found

(Confide) With my toes on the edge, it's such a lovely view
(Don't cry) I never loved anything until I loved you
(Inside) I'm over the edge, what can I do?
(But shine) I haven't a thing unless I have you
(Confide) With my toes on the edge, it's such a lovely view
(Don't cry) I never loved anything until I loved you
(Inside) I'm over the edge, what can I do?
