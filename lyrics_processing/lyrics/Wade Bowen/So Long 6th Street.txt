So long 6th Street
Yeah I think it's time
I'm all outta quarters to play
I'm all outta rhymes
I got a few loose strings
I'm gonna have to leave behind
Please don't hold it against me
I think we both know why
Think we both know why

So long 6th Street, gonna miss you under my feet
Sometimes I've gotta run, run till I can find a heartbeat
Tell Anna when you see her, that I was too weak
To look her in the eye, I hate it when she cries anyway
Well anyway I think she's probably better off without me
So long 6th street
Gonna miss you under my feet

So long Antone's
It's you I'll miss the most
I've stumbled home from your art
How many times I just don't know
Maybe you could leave a light on
In case I come back around
On my way to looking for me
In some lost and found town
