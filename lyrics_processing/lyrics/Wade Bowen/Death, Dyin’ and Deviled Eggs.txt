Well the music was sad
The widows all dressed in black and we sang
Told stories all about the good ol' days
There were hugs to give and a few more tears to cry
Then we closed the lid and we gave him one last ride
And we laid him in the ground
And headed back to town

There were casseroles and pecan pies
Mama's sweet tea and beer on ice
Hell of a way to say goodbye, I guess
Preacher cleared his throat and then he said
Everybody bow your heads
And just like that everything was blessed
So here's to death, dyin' and deviled eggs

Yeah such is life
We're all at the mercy of a butter knife on a plate
Checkered table cloth and I'll fly away
Keep in mind that it always ends the same
And there's no love like no potluck left to say
And they'll lay you in the ground
And all head back to town

Better have Jesus in your soul
Make damn well sure
That you get plenty before you go
