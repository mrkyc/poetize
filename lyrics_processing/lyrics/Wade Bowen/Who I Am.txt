I love to watch the sunset
As it fades behind the trees
Love to talk with God
And get down upon my knees
And I love the times I spend
With my family and friends
Love to dream about
All the places I've never been

And I love to watch you laugh and smile
I love to watch you dream
Love it when you take my hand
And let me know you believe in me
And I love it that you're my girl
I love that I'm your man
Now that you're in my life
Baby I know exactly who I am

Well, I know I love the ladies
Love to go out at night
I love it how we make up
Each and every time that we fight
Oh I love you oh so very much
Yeah, I love you more than words can say
And I don't know how or why
But I love you more every day
