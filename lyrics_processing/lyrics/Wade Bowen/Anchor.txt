You kiss me like I'm an old habit
My name's familiar on your lips
It's not like you've gotta have it
It's more like you got used to it
I'm not a man in desperation
I'm just a man who can't forget
What passion feels like when it's ragin'
What love feels like without a net

I know I'm your solid ground
I know I'm your settle-down
But I miss those days when I could put
Your head in the clouds
Sometimes I wonder if our vow
Is all that's keeping you here now
Am I an anchor or just a rock
You gotta drag around
Oh, drag around

We know each other's every weakness
Sometimes our love's like a battlefield
I bite my tongue to hide the honest
You use your tears like a sword and shield
And I wonder if you ever miss it
Or if you wish for someone else
I don't wanna think about it ending
But I don't wanna stay here by myself

Well I know I'm your solid ground
And I know I'm your settle down
Oh, but I miss those days when I could put
Your head in the clouds
Sometimes I wonder if our vow
Is all that's keeping you here now
Oh, am I an anchor or just a rock
You gotta drag around
Oh, drag around
Well I know I'm your solid ground (I know I'm your solid ground)
I know I'm your settle down (I'm your settle down)
Oh, but I miss those days when I could put
Your head in the clouds
Sometimes I wonder if our vow (Wonder if our vow)
Is all that's keeping you here now
Am I an anchor or just a rock
A rock you drag around
Oh, drag around
Drag around
