He had a master plan
He knew what he wanted, and the only way he could get it
Was cash off in the hand, now, now, now
But Fats, the pusherman, Pretty Tony, another mack
Had plans to keep him down
'Cause they knew he'd be bigger and better at the game
And he would king of town, yeah, yeah, yeah
But Little Lulu, China Doll, and sweet Diane
To help keep him on his feet
With tips from the Blind Man
He knew he would be the baddest mack on the street (Baddest mack on the stret)
