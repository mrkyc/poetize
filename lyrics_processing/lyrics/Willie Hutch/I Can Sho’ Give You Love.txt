I can purchase you a diamond
But it won't be the most expensive diamond
Honey, money can buy
And I'll tell you no lie, no, no, baby
I can't buy you no big ol' Cadillac
I can afford somethin'
To get you where you're going and back
Hey, baby, that I can do yeah

I-ya-ya, just want you to know, where I'm comin' from
I'll be the rock you can stand upon, yeah
You'll never ever be a lonely one
Not if I can help it, baby no, no, no

Like no aero plane

Superman, ain't my name, no, no, no
This ain't no proposition-ah
No, baby, it's no game
Love for each other, darlin'
Is all we have to gain
