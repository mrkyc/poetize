As I was walking to my truck at five past five
She said, "I know you've had a rough week
Why don't you grab a few drinks with the guys"
As I was driving, I was thinking
She never liked me drinking after work before
Either she really loves me
Or she don't really love me anymore
There ain't nothing really wrong that I can put my finger on
But something ain't quite right
Like when I told her I don't want to go have dinner at her momma's
And she just let it slide
And why ain't she complaining
About the laundry I left laying on the bedroom floor?
Either she really loves me
Or she don't really love me any more
Could be she really loves me or she just really trusts me
And finally she's accepting me for who I am
But man I really hope I ain't getting all this rope
Just because she no longer gives a damn
I thought maybe all she needs
Was a little time with me and her favorite wine
That was my simple plan and with the bottle
In my hand I walked up the drive
You might also likeOh, and my eyes started misting
When I saw the words, "Go fishing"
Taped to our front door
Either she really loves me
Or she don't really love me anymore
Could be she really loves me or she just really trusts me
And finally she's accepting me for who I am
But man I really hope I ain't getting all this rope
Just because she no longer gives a damn
I was her lover, I was her friend
And now I'm wondering just what she needs me for
Either she really loves me
Or she don't really love me anymore
Either she really loves me
