I speak to the reality that lives in me and calls to you
Know that you were all of what I live and breath
One hundred proof
Never does a day go by when in your eyes I see my truth
There would be no life for me if ever there's no you
You became the love that grew to know just how the pieces fit
Teaching me the where the when the why the how the truth in it
Understand that all there is and all that there will ever be
There's no way this road to love brings you back to me
Chorus
(Baby)
You're the only one (You're the only one I want)
You're the only one (You take my breath away)
And when I'm with you baby
I fly higher, higher, higher
You're the only one (I want)
You're the only one (Take my breath away)
And when I'm with you baby
I fly higher, higher, higher
I'm standing in that place where life tells me that you're my destiny
Never was afraid to trust
Your love was there to fill my need
Understand that all there is all there will ever be
There no way the earth keeps spinning you right into me
Chorus
(Baby)
You're the only one (You're the only one)
You're the only one (Takes my breath away)
And when I'm with you baby (When I'm with you)
I fly higher, higher, higher (I fly higher)
You're the only one (You're the only)
You're the only one (Only one who takes my breath away)
And when I'm with you baby
I fly higher, higher, higher
You're the only one (You're the only to make me)
You're the only one (feel the way that I do)
And when I'm with you baby (Only you, only you)
I fly higher, higher, higher (lifts me up, up higher)
You're the only one (You're the only one)
You're the only one (You're the only one that I need)
And when I'm with you baby
I fly higher, higher, higher
