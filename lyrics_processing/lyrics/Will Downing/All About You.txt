I'm not a perfect man, but I do the best I can
To make you feel satisfied
I can't think of nothing else
I just can't help myself
I wish that you were right by my side
I called you on the phone
And even stopped by your home
I gotta see you so bad
You're always on my mind
And I feel you deep inside
Baby, you're the best thing that I ever had

And have I told you, you mean the world to me
And it's all about you
Let me show you together what we can be
And it's all about you and me
It's all about you, baby, about you, baby

I like the things you do
The sexy way you move
You know the things that I like, yes, you do
For me there's only you, for you my love is true
I'll never ever leave you, girl, and that's no lie
