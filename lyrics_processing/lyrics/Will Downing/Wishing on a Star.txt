To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means, yeah
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying that it comes
I'm wishing on the loving we've never done
I never thought I would see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we have spent
I just can't let you go, for me you were meant
But I didn't mean to hurt you but I know
That in the game of love you reap what you sow
And I, I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
Make the best of things, oh baby, when we're together
Whether or never
I feel it's time for us to make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
Make the best of things, ooh baby, when we're together, yes, I do
Whether or never, my baby
