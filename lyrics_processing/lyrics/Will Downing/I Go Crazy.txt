Hello girl, it's been awhile
Guess you'll be glad to know
That I've learned how to laugh and smile
Getting over you was slow
They say old lovers can't be good friends
But I never thought I'd really see you
I'd see you again

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes I still go crazy
No, my heart just can't hide that old feeling inside
Way deep down inside, oh baby

You say he satisfies your mind
Told you all of his dreams
I know how much that means to you
I realize that I was blind
Just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true
No, it just ain't true

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes I still go crazy
No, my heart just can't hide that old feeling inside
Way deep down inside, oh baby
