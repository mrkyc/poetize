If I could, if I could

A cold and lonely October
First time I saw your smile
This time I've always remembered
Constantly on my mind
And If ever we should ever meet again
I promise all my love to you

If I could, I'd catch falling a star for you
And I'd make a wish and even if skies were blue
For you to love me, 'cause I love you 'til the end of time

Ooh ooh, yeah, oh

Now it's the third of December
And love's still on my mind
And I'm thinking If I could only see your face again
I would, I would be alright
And I'll always be the one you need
And I will always love you

And I'd make a wish and even if skies were blue
For you to love me, 'cause I love you 'til the end of time

Ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
If I could I would

I need you in my arms tonight
If only in my dreams
I'd rather hold my pillow tight
Than hold somebody else, 'cause nobody else makes me feel
The way you do, so good inside
Even if it's in my mind

If I could, I'd catch falling a star for, for you
I'd make a wish and even if skies were blue
For you to love me if I could, if I could, yeah, oh oh oh, yeah
If I could, I'd catch a falling star for my baby
(If I could) Make a wish and make it come true
For you to love me
'Cause I love you 'til the end of time, yeah yeah
If I could (Yeah yeah), I'd catch a star for you
(If I could, if I could, if I could)
Even if skies were blue
For you to love me, if I could
(For you to love me, you to love me, you, oh, hey)
If I could (If I could), I'd catch a star for you
(If I could, whoa-whoa, oh-oh-oh)
Even if skies were blue
(If I could, if I could)
For you to love me, if I could
(Gon' make love to you, baby, yeah yeah)
