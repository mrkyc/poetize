Thinking of how to mend
Our broken hearts
We fell in love so easily
But now it seems
We can't work it out
Can't seem to work it out
So relax tonight
It doesn't matter who is wrong or right
My love
As long as we both know
We gave it all
To save the love we shared my love
But a simple kiss before we say goodbye
Before we say goodbye
Before we say goodbye
Looking back
Over the years
I guess we've shed some tears
But we've always made it through
And I don't know
Just where we went wrong
I'm sorry we're moving on
We couldn't seem to work it out
Can't seem to work it out

My love
As long as we both know
We gave it all
To save the love we shared my love
But a simple kiss
Before we say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Before we say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Before you go
Can we take this time to reminisce
Say goodbye to love
And the way we used to hug
And the way we used to kiss
Before you go
Answer me this
Tell me
Why'd you want to leave me
What'd you have to do
So bad
My baby
Oh my love
Can I just hold your hand
Just one more time before you do it
Can I just kiss your lips
Just one more time before you say
Goodbye
Oh
Leaving me
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I'm gonna
I'm gonna miss your friendship
I'm gonna miss your love
Your love
Your love
Yes I am
Oh
Oh you're here with me tonight
Tell you what's on my mind
What's in my heart
What's in my life
