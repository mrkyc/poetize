An angels come my way and put a spell on me
I'm in a daze, I can't believe it's true
But every where we touched, every time we kiss
Inside I feel brand new
You've got me riding on a cloud, don't ever wanna come down
You got me floating in my dreams and even singing way out load
You've got my heart so open wide sometimes I feel like I can fly
Way up high, you've got me riding on a cloud
How could you know just what I would need and more?
And how did you see what my heart was yearning for?
You looked inside and knocked down the walls of my pride
Now I'm free from fear and the air is clear
 some magic carpet ride
You've got me riding on a cloud, don't ever wanna come down?
You got me floating in my dreams and even singing way out load
You've got my heart so open wide sometimes I feel like I can fly
Way up high, you've got me riding on a cloud
On skies of Azur Blue, oh, I'm traveling on high altitude
Across the midnight stars I'm floating it's all because of you
Everywhere I go, loves winds are blowing
And every single day I'm falling deeper and deeper in love
