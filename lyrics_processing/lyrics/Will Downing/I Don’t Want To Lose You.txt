I don't wanna lose you
I love you as you are
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't love you more
So please tell me that love will remain
Though we may change

Who do you think you are?
Who do you wanna be?
You're the only one that really knows
Maybe you'll be surprised
After your search is through
Then you'll find that you've been chasing you

Believe me, I understand
The visions of your mind
But I'm so afraid that the one you'll find
May not need someone like me

But I don't wanna lose you
I love you as you are
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't love you more
So please tell me that love will remain
Though we may change

But you've gotta try and I realize
And I'll help you all I can
