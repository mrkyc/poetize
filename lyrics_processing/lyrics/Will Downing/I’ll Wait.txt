Ooh ooh ah
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Hey

I can see the warm look of love within your eyes
And as the sun fades into the darkness, thoughts of making love arise
But I would rather be alone tonight
Please don't tempt me, girl, 'cause the time is not right

If I were to make love to you
My feelings of love won't be true
Might be best if I just walked away

Yeah, just wait (I'll wait) for love (For love)
If it takes me all night, I'm not gonna do anything until it's right
I'll wait (I'll wait) for love (For love)
Yes (I'll wait), I am gonna wait

Ooh ooh ah, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm in no rush to fall too deep, it's just the state I'm in
Sometimes loneliness gets kind of hard on a man
But much more than I need a lover, first I need a friend
Someone who will always be there, someone I can depend

In time, love's bound to come
And maybe you'll be the one
But right now is not the time for me

Hey, I'm gonna wait (I'll wait) for love (For love)
If it takes me all night, I'm not gonna do anything until it's right
I'll wait (I'll wait) for love (For love)
Yeah (I'll wait), I am gonna wait
(I'll wait) Yeah (For love)
If it takes me all night, I'm not gonna do anything until it's right
I'll wait (I'll wait) for love (For love)
Hey (I'll wait)

Take your time, wait for love, yes
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I am gonna wait (I'll wait) for love (I'll wait), yeah baby
(I'll wait) Can you wait? No, wait
Can you wait? (I'll wait) Hey (I'll wait)
I am gonna wait (I'll wait), ayy-hey (I'll wait)
For love (I'll wait)
Can you wait? Can you wait? Can you wait? (I'll wait, I'll wait)
I'll wait (I'll wait), yeah yeah
Wait (I'll wait), wait (I'll wait), gonna wait (I'll wait)
Oh yeah, I'll wait (I'll wait)
Can you wait? (I'll wait)
I'm gonna wait (I'll wait)
