By the ocean smiling, on my special island
Gentle breezes, the sun and sand and surf and sea
Called you here to me
I'll be waiting for you, baby
You'll forget about time, where the earth meets the sky
Here's the question: Don't you want to get away
To my hideaway? I'll be waiting

Some people say love is fantasy
If you fly away with me, we can make it real
Come and spend some time on my island (My island)

There's no point avoiding, love can be rewarding
Take a chance on paradise not far away
At my hideaway, I've been wanting you forever
Should true loving do you, I can give that to you
You're the reason every day I wait to see
Where you're gonna to be, always wanting, oh-oh

Some people say love is fantasy
If you fly away with me, we can make it real
Come and spend some time on my island (My island)
All you need is to believe
If you open up, I'll fulfill your every need
I can give you love on my island (My island)
Yeah
