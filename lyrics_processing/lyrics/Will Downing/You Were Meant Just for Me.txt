Listen baby
I need to get something off my chest
My whole world has changed, and you are to blame
But it's complicated, since we both are dating
My head's confused, but my heart wants you
Look at all the time we shared, every conversation
Every loving stare was motivation
I fantisized that we'd be more than friends
(much more than friends)
Now every time I'm with her I wanna say your name
And when I feel her touch, it's not the same
It just seems unfair, cause we'd make the perfect pair
There's no coincidence, you're heaven sent, my destiny
I believe that you were (you were meant just for me)
You were meant for me, yes you were, baby
(You were meant just for me) exclusively, woah
(You were meant just for me)
You were meant for me
Deep down in my heart I believe
You were, you were meant for me
Should I be ashamed when I feel the same?
Ain't just for your call, can't wait til we're alone
It's gettin hard, I feel it, and my man, he can sense it
I feel you, and it's okay cause if you can calculate it
We're just imaginating. I don't care, find me, this is happening
You were meant for me
(You were meant just for me)
You were meant for me
(You were meant just for me)
You were meant for me
You were meant for me
(you were meant just for me)
I'm fine, it ain't just a sign, no matter what the situation
You were meant for me babe
No, my, ain't no need denying
It don't matter what the obligation, you were meant for me, babe
I'm fine, it ain't just a sign, no matter what the situation
You were meant for me babe
No, my, ain't no need denying
It don't matter what the obligation, you were meant for me, babe
I can see it in your eyes when you look at me and what do I see it too
