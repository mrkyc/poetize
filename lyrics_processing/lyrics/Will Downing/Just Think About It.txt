Pretty lady
I know you think the grass is greener over on the other side
But I'm here to tell you
That nothing and no one in this world's love can compare to mine, oh no

Baby, you can do what you like
But before I let you go
Let me put this on your mind

Think about it long and hard (Baby)
Before you do anything to hurt me and do me wrong
Think about it long and hard (And hard, sugar)
Before you do what you do when you do what you're doing to me (Yeah)

Just think about it
Think about the times we've shared
Think about the one who cares
I'm the one who's always been around to satisfy you
Can we give this one more try?
I promise you that I
Will be the man that you once knew
The man you fell in love with

Do what you like
But before you walk out that door
Let me put this on your mind

Think about it long and hard (Long and hard)
Before you do anything to hurt me and do me wrong
Think about it long and hard (Think about it, baby, sugar)
Before you do what you do when you do what you're doing to me (Yeah)

Why throw away what we have
We've been together for so long, baby
May not be perfect love
But I know that we can make this thing work out, mmm
(Just think) Think about it, baby, think about it, baby, yeah, yeah
(Just think) Think about it, baby, think about it, baby, yeah yeah yeah

Think about it long and hard (Darling)
Before you do anything to hurt me and do me wrong
Think about it long and hard (And hard, sugar)
Before you do what you do when you do what you're doing to me
(Do what you do, do what you do, do, do what you do, do what you do, baby)
Think about it long and hard (Yes, think about it, baby, yes)
Before you do anything (Before you do me wrong)
Think about it long and hard (Long and hard)
Before you do what you do when you do what you're doing to me
(Before you do what you do when you do what you do, do what you're doing to me, yeah)
(Just think about it) Think about it, think about it, baby
