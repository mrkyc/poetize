When I wake up early in the morning
And I see you lying happy in my bed
Sleeping oh so softly on your pillow
All these crazy things go through my head
You and I were meant to be forever
Baby, you're my early morning loving light
As long as there's a sun, we'll be together
I can't wait to be with you, my love, tonight

'Cause you and I
We make a lover's paradise
You and I
We make a lover's paradise

When I come home early every evening
And I find you waiting happily for me
When I reach my hand out and I touch you
Am I dreaming, girl? Are you for real?
You and I will always stay together
Baby, nothing strong enough to make this part
As long as there are stars forever shining
Then you know you hold the secret to my heart
