Once again
It's happening
What can I do?
Though I try real hard
I can't resist
Your tenderness
Keeps drawing me closer to you
The gentle way
You touch my face
And how you speak and call my name
Let's me know that there's no need to fear
You always here
And I'm falling babe yehhhhh!
(Chorus)
Feeling a spark deep inside of my heart and I want you babe
I'm falling in love with you
Starting a fire of burning desire yes I'm falling babe
I'm falling in love with you
Feeling as high as the stars in the sky when I'm with you babe
I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling
Falling in love
Be still my heart
Don't beat too fast
I feel like I'm gonna loose control
I'm not usually the one that's so emotional
And feeling the way that I do
So suddenly
She captured me
She stole my heart and won't let go
But it feels so good to finally see
What love can be
And I owe it all to you

Falling in love
I'm trying to speak
Straight from my heart
So much to say
I don't know where to start
All I know is that
I'm crazy, crazy for you
You're that special someone
Right out of my dreams
You opened my eyes
You made me believe
I could fall in love with you
(Chorus)
Feeling you smile deep inside of my heart and I want you babe
I'm falling in love with you
Starting a fire of burning desire yes I'm falling babe
I'm falling in love
Feeling as high as the stars in the sky when I'm with you babe
