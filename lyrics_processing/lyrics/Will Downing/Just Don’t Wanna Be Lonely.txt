I don't mind when you say that you're going away
I just don't wanna be lonely
And I don't care if we share only moments a day
I just don't wanna be lonely

I'd rather be loved and needed
Depended on to give a love I can't give
When you're gone, when you're gone (When you're gone)
I just don't wanna be lonely
I'd rather be loved
I'd rather be loved, baby, yes, I would

I don't mind when the time sets the sun to the moon
I just don't wanna be lonely, no, no, no
(Just don't wanna be lonely)
Let the stair find you there way down at the end of the room
I just don't wanna be lonely, no
(Just don't wanna be lonely)

I'd rather be loved and needed
Depended on to give a love I can't give
When you're gone, when you're gone (When you're gone)
I just don't wanna be lonely
I'd, I'd rather be loved, baby
(Don't wanna be lonely)
I don't wanna be lonely, I'd rather be loved
I just (Just don't wanna be lonely)
I just don't wanna be lonely
(I'd rather be loved, don't wanna be lonely)
I'd rather be loved 'cause I just don't wanna be lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, no no no
(Rather be loved, rather be loved) Hmm, mhm, hmm
