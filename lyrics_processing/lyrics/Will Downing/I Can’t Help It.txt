Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you, baby
It gets better all the time

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, baby, if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I can't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, baby, if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I can't help it, no

Love to run my fingers
Softly as you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to heaven, heaven, heaven
Heaven is the prize
I'm so glad I found you
You're an angel in disguise
