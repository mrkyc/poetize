How much I love you, baby
And how much I wanna be your only man, ooh baby
Just be baby
Baby, baby, baby you don't have to go
Stay a little while longer baby
I wanna talk to you just a little more
I see the little tears in your eyes about to fall
And you are wondering if I'm, if I'm for real
But if you cry, wonder why you cry
I tell you, know why this is how I feel, this is how I feel
Baby I'm for real
Baby I'm for real
I'm for real, yes baby
I'm for real baby
That's the beat of my heart
You should kill me baby
If you wanna know the truth about it
Girl, I just can't live with out you, no, no baby
That's why I'm confessing my love to you
So that I could live my whole life baby
Baby let me live my whole life with you baby
