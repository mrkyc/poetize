Maybe its been, like its not even there
When I touch you, you feel so distant
Kissing her kills, baby
Is still no differnet
Have we been so busy
(that we can't make time)
For some intimacy yeah
( when the moment is right)
I still want you, baby
As you can't see
Feels like you slipping away from me oh oh
Do you know how I feel
Do you care
( am I just here)
Do you know what I need
Do you know baby
Do you really know x4 baby
Looking back on happier times
I touched your body and you wouldn't mind (you wouldn't mind)
Now it seems everything that I do, somehow bothers ( Lord)
Seems to annoy you
What more can I say, I
Given everything I've got
Anything that I have done right, you conviniently forgot
Are you listening, do you hear what I say
We can't go on this way.. nooohhh
Do you know how I feel
Do you care, am I just here
Do you know what I need
(Baby)
Do you really know
Do you really Know
(DO you really Know)??
Do you really know
Do you really know
Hhhm
What happened to that thing we had
(to that ooohhh oohhhh)
Good times that we shared
We talked all night
Then call one another for days
Can we get back to that loving lust, that special bond we had between us
Oohhhh oojjj
Do you know
Do you know how I feel
Do you care (ooo oohh ohh ) Am I just here DO you know?
DO you know waht I need
Baby, do you know, do you really know
Do you know
Do your really know, Do you know?
My feelings baby, baby baby baby ( do you care)
Do you really care, or am i jsut here to amuse you baby ( do you know what I need)
Do you, Do you , Do you know
Do you , DO you Do you really know ! baby
