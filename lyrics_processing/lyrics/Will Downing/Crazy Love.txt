It's been a while, a long, long time
Since I had someone like you to do what you do (To me)
It's evident just how I feel
Since you came in my life everything seems just right
(Things seemed alright to me)
To lose your would be a damn shame
The thought of you not in my life would drive me insane

'Cause I'm crazy in love with you (Crazy love)

(Open arms, baby, you're my) Everything (Oh)
My best friend in this world
(This whole wide world, baby, yeah)
Everything that I do, see, I do it for you
'Cause I'm crazy in love with you
