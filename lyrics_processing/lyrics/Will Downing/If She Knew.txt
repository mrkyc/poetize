8:45
I knew she'll be coming in real soon
So every day I come in early
Just to wait for her
She'll sit at her desk
Pull back her hair then spray perfume
And as it fills the room
I just close my eyes and I start to fantasize

'Cause If she knew (If she knew)
Would she come to me?
If she knew (If she knew)
Would she run to me
And then say "I love you"?
Oh, I wonder what she'd do (I wonder)
I wonder what she'd do if she knew
Mmm, baby

Five after 1:00
And usually she'd be back from lunch
And I start to think of all these crazy things
Oh, where could she be?
Is there someone else
Someone who's living out my dreams?
Why can't it be me?
I'm gonna say what's on my mind when she returns, yes

'Cause if she knew (If she knew)
That I care for her
If she knew (If she knew)
I'd be there for her and always, I'd be true
Oh, I wonder what she'd do (I wonder)
I wonder what she'd do (Ooh)

'Cause if I could tell her
Say exactly what I'm feeling inside
I would give my all to you
(I would give my all)
Dedicate my life to you
(Dedicate my life)
Hold you tight and never let go

'Cause if she knew (If she knew)
Would she come to me?
If she knew (If she knew)
Would she run to me
And then say "I love you"?
Oh-oh, I wonder what she'd do (I wonder)
I wonder what she'd do if she knew (If she knew)
Hey, that I care for her
If she knew, baby (If she knew)
I'd be there for her and always I'd be true, whoa-whoa
I wonder what she'd do (I wonder)
I wonder what she'd do
If she knew
Ooh baby
