Kind of hard to believe a girl like you has never found
(Special love)
What can I say? What can I do just to get closer?
(Closer to you)
If you could feel what I feel about you
Then you know that love
Baby, that love can be something special
(Love can be something special)
Baby, I'd like to try to be the one in your life
And show you that
(Love can be something special)
If you don't mind, baby, can I get closer to you?
This is all about you, baby
There's no way you could know
I've been touching you from a distance
(Touching you)
There's no way you could know
When you hide behind your defenses
You close you heart
And your mind just seems to follow
I'm not your yesterday, baby
I'm your tomorrow
Baby, love can be something special
