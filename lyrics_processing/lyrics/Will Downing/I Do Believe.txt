I still believe in miracles
And Lord I hope you do
I've been there when nothing else
But a miracle would take me through
Taking a chance
With all the faith in my heart
Back to the wall, I'll give it all
'Cause I know you're gonna give it all back to me

I do believe
That Heaven and Earth
Start here with you and me
Here in our arms
A new world begins
I'll let it shine on me
This has to be
I do believe

People die out of loneliness
It happens every day
It only takes a little tenderness
To ease all the hurt away
Having you here
Healing my life with your arms
Loving you so
All that I know
Is that I'm never, ever gonna let you go
