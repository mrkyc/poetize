So don't you hang up on me till I've said it all
It's a crazy situation but I can't handle it alone
So many complications, it's hard to tell you on the phone
While I'm unwinding
Let me give the bottom line
Come back home
Got a little heartache, you can make it better
Got a little heartache, it's tearing me apart
If you don't want to listen to what I say
I'm gonna give it to you anyway
Straight to the heart, straight to the heart
You could blame it on my actions
But I did not mean to hurt
I could blame your cold reactions
Tell me, did you mean those words?
Well, I guess it's true
Everything you say and do
Goes to my heart
Got a little heartache, you can make it better
Got a little heartache, it's tearing me apart
If you don't want to listen to what I say
I'm gonna give it to you anyway
Straight to the heart, straight to the heart
