Well, I hear it comin'
I can feel it in my bones
And it's weighin' heavy on me
Like a sack full of stones
And I see it in your eyes, baby
Each time we meet
And I sense somethin' movin'
Underneath our feet

Baby, our love is on the fault line
And you're sayin' that the fault's mine
I can't believe that you're so blind
Can't believe, can't believe
You've been stirrin' up an earthquake
You've been cookin' up a heartbreak
And I hope it ain't too late
For our love, for our love

Now there's a chilly wind a-blowin'
And it's whippin' up a gale
Storm clouds are brewin'
And I know it's gonna hail
And I see it in your eyes, baby
Each time we meet
And I sense somethin' movin'
Underneath our feet
