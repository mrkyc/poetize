Half of your love is just not what I'm after
Part of your world is just not what I need
Some of your time is like one glass of water
Just keeps me thirsty for wine

So fill me up to the top
Oh, don't you stop
'Til I'm overflowin'
Love is the seed
And, babe, I need
You to keep it growin' stronger every day
Oh, love
Don't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)
Don't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)

Never before have I settled for second
All of my life I have hungered for more
Now, I can see where your sweet love can lead me
This is what I have waited for

So fill me up to the top
Oh, don't you stop
'Til I'm overflowin'
Love is the seed
And, babe, I need
You to keep it growin' stronger every day
Oh, love
Don't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)
Don't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)
