For all the times you stood by me through right and wrong
For bein' there to catch me when I'd fall
I love you for your faith in me
For all the joys you've given me
But there's one thing makes me love you most of all

You never gave up on me when I was givin', love, up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work you stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when I was makin' things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love somebody

I know sometimes we might not see things eye to eye
You've always met me more than half the way
So for all the times I've let you down
And you could have packed your things and gone
I love you most of all because you stayed

And you never gave up on me when I was givin'g, love, up on you
Never mattered who was right or wrong
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when I was makin' things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love

There were times I just knew you
You did not understand my mood
All those long and sleepless nights I put us through
You stuck by me anyway
Gave me love ev'ry day
Now, there's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you

'Cause you never gave up on me when I was givin', love, up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work you stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when I was makin' things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love
'Cause you never gave up on me when I was givin', love, up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work you stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when I was makin' things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love
