We don't want to be left behind
All we want to do is just blow your mind
Just one more time...

And you say New York City right about now
To the sounds you hear, def to your ear, you have no fear
The Mix Master Mike, Disco Dave
The amazing Crash Crew is here
Back by popular demand, to shock the mother land
Giving you more than what you bargained for
In your mind bringing you the baddest jams we can find
We are here to tell the world just who we are
Shocking females cause we are superstars
Let me tell you, the bass in your face the highs in your eyes
So make your nature rise, cause
We are the Crash Crew and we rock 'til you can't survive
So it's Friday the 3rd and we heard the word
That Mike and Dave was taking over the town
And now the happy people was dancing to the beat
Of the vicious Crash Crew sound
We're two deejays, six emcees
We rock the house so viciously
You might also like
I'm the R, the E, double G-I-E
Be the highest degree and the warmest key to
Satisfy your needs and curiosities

Well I'm the B-dash-S, T-R to the O
Said I came here to rock, I came here to roll
Wouldn't touch the wack with a 10 foot pole

I'm the L to the A, the S-H-U, to the B-E-E, I'm La ShuBee
Because I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
They talk about me over cups of tea

Well I'm the M to the I the K-E-C
Because I rock the mic with tranquility
With the force of the five not four emcees cause
I am the only EK Mike C

And I'm the G double E the M-A-N
And I want you young ladies just to understand that
I'm spreading my loving from land to land
Doing it all with my master plan
And I come to you in a radio wave
I rock the house cause I can't behave
All the females on the jock just craze and crave
I go by the name of Disco Dave
So don't quit the beat quittin'
Stop the beat stompin'
Come on Darryl C, just keep on rockin'
We'll keep on rockin'
So run to the front to peep us out because
We be rockin' the house, say without a doubt
We ride around town in slick hot rods
We're the newest sensation since Hardest Hard
But Reggie Reg is better for your head
Barry B-Stro is better for your head
ShuBee is better for your head
EK Mike C is better for your head
The Mellow Gee-Man is better for your head
Disco Dave is better for your head
Mix Master Mike is better for your head
So if you got 19 and you're on the go
Somebody say "Ho, Ho!"

And you don't stop, cause
I'm super cool and got a high potential
Necessary elements and essential
Rocking the house with the greatest of ease
We're bringing young ladies down to their knees
So come in the door, we'll make you dance
Soon you'll be a victim of circumstance
We find your feet in a disco trance and
When you think of escape there is no chance
The beat holds you tight when we're on the mic
I'm MC Reggie Reg and I'm out of sight
So B-Stro, my mellow
What it look like when you're on the mic
Tell the sucker emcees "Don't bite!"
Well I'm one of a kind and I feel real fine
I rock young ladies most any time
I may sound conceited but I'll tell you what
I've got a bunch of girls trying to bust my nut
I want all of y'all to understand, that
Barry B-Stro is a ladies man
I want all of you to shout it out
What Barry B-Stro is all about
A is for apple, J is for jacks
If you don't get down you must be wack
Put the needle to the groove that makes you move
Put the bass in the face to rock this place
Put the highs in your eyes to make your nature rise
Come on y'all, let's do it
ShuBee, my mellow my man
Turn on your mic, can you rock, yeah
Like I know you can

You know that! Because I got it like that, young ladies
I'm sure to delight when I'm on the mic
I'm guaranteed to rock the house all night
I told the sucker emcees, don't you bite
Said I took the munch from Captain Crunch
I taught Muhammad Ali the knock out punch
Told Leon Spinks to brush his teeth
I told the M&M man his chocolate's too sweet
I helped General Motors to build their cars
I made a rocket ship that can reach the stars
Said now you know and now you see why
I go by the name of MC ShuBee
So Mike C ("Yeah?") my mellow
What it look like when you're on the mic

Well I was born with the name that was so damn fly
You see the fly girls can never pass it by
I was born with the walk that was so unique
Plus the fly boys bust whenever I speak
I was born with class and I was born with style
I was made with the rap that's worth your while
You see the E is for every chance I get
To rock to the rhythm so you won't forget
You see the K is for the knowledge of the galaxy
Because everybody knows, everybody knows girls
Everybody knows EK Mike C
You see I got my rhyme and you got your own
Come on, Gee-Man, get on the microphone

Because I think females are all the same
They all get slick and they play the game, but
Listen here, I got something for you
This is what I'm going to do
I'm gonna rock it don't stop it, cause the party has begun
So come on females, get on the dance floor
Let the fellas have some fun
Because I'm here tonight to rock the mic
So please understand
That it's DJ Darryl C. and the mellow Gee-Man
And when I'm on the mic I'm sheer delight and
I'm the women's pride and joy
For the sucker emcees that get in my way
It's them I do destroy, cause
I'm the super-duper loop di looper
Number one emcee splendor
And if you mess with me I'm sure you'll agree
That I am no beginner
So Disco, my mellow, it's on you so what you gonna do

Well girls, girls, girls, girls
It's girls I can't ignore
I like them sweet and kind intelligent and fine
It's them I do adore
With class and style I make it worth their while
When I take one on a date
Any race or creed is fine with me
You see I don't discriminate
Yes girls, girls, girls, girls
Can improve any man's life
They put your mind at ease and fulfill your needs
When you take one for your wife
At the wave of your hands follow your commands
Doing what you'll tell them to
Under pressure or stress they'll perform the best
Just as long as you are true
You see you must understand to be a ladies man
You treat them with grace and pride
Goes hand in hand to be a gentleman
And they'll always be by your side
Well girls, girls, girls, girls
Reach out and clap your hands
Because my mellow on the mic I know you like
And they call him Gee-Man

As you're walking down the street with your box in your hand
And you're playing the music of the Poison Clan
You're walking the pavement of the sundry street and
You're snapping your fingers to the sure shot beat and
Then you hear Gee-Man on your radio rapping
Your feet start to dance and
Then your hands start to clap and so
You say to your friend that he's really good
I'm gonna tape this show and rock the whole neighborhood
So you tape the show and it sounds so very nice
So you sell it around the block for a very high price
Now the whole damn block is trying to sound like me!
But I'm the original and not a duplicated copy, so...

Buzzy Buzz, my mellow my man (?)
LSD, my mellow my man
Mace G, my mellow my man (?)
TC, my mellow my man
Forty Five, my mellow my man
