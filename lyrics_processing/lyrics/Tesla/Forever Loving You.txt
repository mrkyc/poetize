Love would always be something that come and go
Oh well
But now I feel so differently
It seems everything has changed dramatically
I can tell
Cause I know what I know
And I know that it's real
If you knew what I know
You'd know how I feel
Cause when a love is true
The way that I love you
Love is forever
Forever loving you
Beyond space and time
Above the stars that shine
Love is forever
Forever loving you
And then you came along
I didn't care what's right or wrong
All that really mattered is you came my way
Now I don't just sing about it
I do believe without a doubt
There ain't no doubt each and every day
This thing called love will always find a way

I know it's real
If you'd listen to my heart
You'd know how I feel
Cause when a love is true
The way that I love you
Love is forever
Forever loving you
And this old heart of mine
For you will always shine
Love is forever
Forever loving you
When the rain came pouring down
With the wind blowing all around
So hard that it knocked my feet off of the ground
Hope was all I could hold on to
There was nothing else left, what could I do?
And finally it was love that saw me through
So I hope what'll happen to me
Happens to you
Cause when a love is true
The way that I love you
Love is forever
Forever loving you
Beyond space and time
Above the stars that shine
Love is forever
Forever loving you
And this old heart of mine
For you will always shine
Love is forever
Forever and ever
Beyond space and time
My heart will always shine for you
Forever
