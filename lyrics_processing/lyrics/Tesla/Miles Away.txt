All the time that I spent missing home
And I try not to complain
But sometimes it won't leave me alone
And I think I know myself better than anyone else
'Cause I'm me I ought to know
What I want, what I need, what's inside of me
Maybe something that I took, to get out of my head
Or took for the thrill
The way I dress, the way that I look, or the way that I pay the bills
'Cause you're miles away, miles away
How could you be so wrong
'Cause you're miles away, miles away
How could you know the score
All eyes on the stage, all the glitter and the glow
Move to the rhythm while striking a pose
Music and melody and words to a poem
You think that you know me, you're not even close
Though I'm living out my dream
Wasn't long 'till I figured it out
Nothin' ever comes for free
Even here on the merry-go-round
So you wanna take a ride
Rollin' and living the life
'Cause you think I got it made
Well, in case you don't know my friend died today
And it's tearing me apart
If I knew what to say, don't know where to start
I reach down in my heart and with paper and pen put it in a song

'Cause you're miles away, miles away, how could you know the score?
All eyes on the stage, all the glitter and glow
Move to the rhythm while striking a pose
Music and melody and words to a poem
You think that you know me, you're not even close
The pages have burned but they're written in stone
Now what will become of us now nobody knows
And the wheel keeps on turning and I rise and I fall
And I'll try to get back but I'm lost in it all
And I look all around and I see that it's gone
You're miles away
Miles away

You're miles away
Yeah you're miles away
Miles away
