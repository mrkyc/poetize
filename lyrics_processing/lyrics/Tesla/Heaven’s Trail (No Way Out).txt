I'm always ready to kick ass
Up on the stage, I'm in a rage
Yes, I'm having the time of my life
Yes indeed, what a sweet, sweet life it is
Until some loco two-bit floozy
With a Louis LeStrange
Ain't good for nothin' but trouble
They're just two fools livin' up to their names
And now it's startin' to rain on my parade
No, there's nothin' like the real world
To get me down
Nothin' like the world outside
That turns me upside down
Makes me feel like I'm headin' down
A one-way, dead end street
There's no way out, no way out
Of this living hell
No way out, no way out
Unless you walk Heaven's trail
No way out, no way out
Of this living hell, livin' hell

Thinkin' that it's not so bad after all
That's when I woke up, smelled the coffee
Now I'm back where I started again, yes
And now it's pourin' rain on my parade
No, there's nothin' like the real world
To get me down, no
One is there to lift you up
One to drag you down
Now, don't you see that we're headin' down
A one-way, dead end street
There's no way out, no way out
Of this living hell
No way out, no way out
Unless you walk Heaven's trail
No way out, no way out
Of this living hell, living hell
There's no way out, no way out
Of this living hell
No way out, no way out
Unless you walk Heaven's trail
No way out, no way out
Of this living hell
I guess I'll live in hell
There's no way out, no way out
Of this living hell
No way out, no way out
Unless you walk Heaven's trail
No way out, no way out
Of this living hell, livin' hell
You know, I'm on a slick trip
