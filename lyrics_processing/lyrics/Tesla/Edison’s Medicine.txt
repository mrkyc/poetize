Second and third as well
My jury finds you'll be serving your time
When you go straight to hell
Cause he was Lord of the Lightning
Though "socially frightening"
But never out to sell
Their nickels and pence
Meant more than did sense
And not the sensible thing
Nor did the man outta time, man outta time
Thought you was crazy, you was one of a kind
Man outta time, man outta time
All along, world was wrong, you was right
All that he saw, all he conceived
They just could not believe
Steinmetz and Twain were friends that remained
Along with number three
He was electromagnetic, completely kinetic
"New Wizard of the West."
But they swindled and whined that he wasn't our kind
And said Edison knew best
See Tesla LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also likeHe was the man outta time, man outta time
Thought you was crazy, you was one of a kind
Man outta time, man outta time
Said you was outta your mind!
You took a shot and it did you in
Edison's medicine
You played your cards, but you couldn't win
Edison's medicine
I spent twelve years of hard time
More like the best years of my life
Never heard or read a single word
About "the man" and his "wicked mind."
They'll sell you on Marconi
Familiar, but a phony
Story goes they sold their souls
And swore that you'd never know
About the man outta time, man outta time
Thought you was crazy, you was one of a kind
Man outta time, man outta time
Swore you was outta your mind!
You took a shot and it did you in
Edison's medicine
You played your cards, but you couldn't win
Edison's medicine
You took a shot and it did you in
Edison's medicine
You played your cards, but you couldn't win
Edison's medicine
