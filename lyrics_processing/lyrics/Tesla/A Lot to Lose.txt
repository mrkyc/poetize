I thought I saw the light, if it was then tell me, did you see it too
Did you see the light, if you did now tell me, could you feel it too
Hey I saw the light, yeah tell me that you saw the light

I got alot of love for you, I guess that means I got alot to lose
I got alot of love for you and only you
I don't know how we even do it, all I know is I'm so glad
We always make it through it, one more time now baby

I don't know how we make it through it, all I know is I'm so glad
We always seem to do it, one way or another
We're gonna make it or break
