Well, it goes on and on and on again
Like a driving rain
Like a snowflake in the sun
Fallin' out of the sky on everyone
You and me, everybody, everyone, now everybody you see
We travelled so long, seemed like forever
Never mattered just as long as we're together
I travelled alone, you know it gets so... oh, oh no
And this time
And it rolls on and on and over again
Like a driving rain
Like a snow flake in the sun
Fallin' out of the sky on everyone
You and me, everybody, everyone, now everybody you see
You know I said it before
You're the only one that can make me feel better
I'm lonely out here on my own
Try so hard - I try so hard to believe
Try so hard - Are you believing me?
Try so hard - You know, I try so hard
Try some more 'cause feeling is believing
Try so hard - I try so hard to believe
Try so hard - Are you believing me?
Try so hard - You know, I try so hard
Try some more, feeling is believing

Doesn't matter 'cause I know we'll be together
I'm singing this song 'til I see you again
Try so hard - I try so hard to believe
Try so hard - Are you believing me?
Try so hard - You know, I try so hard
Try some more 'cause feeling is believing
Try so hard - I try so hard to believe
Try so hard - Are you believing me?
Try so hard - You know, I try so hard
Try some more, feeling is believing
Yeah, seeing is believing
Feeling is believing
Seeing is believing, feeling is believing
Whoa, yeah
Seeing, seeing and feeling is believing
I try so hard
