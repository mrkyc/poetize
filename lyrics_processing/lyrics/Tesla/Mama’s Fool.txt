Out on the road, and a long long way from home
Why must I be so, must I be so misunderstood
While my intentions, my intentions all are good
Wish only one time that things would turn out like they should
Just like they should
Too many times, too many times payin' the price, just for the thrill
Too many highs, too many times, overkill
So many times, double around, how many faces do reveal
How many folks gettin' to be over the hill
She always told me things, like girls were made of sugar and spice
She always scolded me, Don't let the same dog bite you twice
Well I, Lord I've just been fooled again
Mama she raised no fool - you did not raise no fool
Mama I ain't no fool - I've just been fooled again
Mama she raised no fool - you did not raise no fool
Mama I ain't no fool - well I've just been fooled again
Too many lies, shame on the wives, too many cakes and eat it too
Too many hearts goin' straight down the tube
Hell of a dude, damned if I don't have the time and the words for use
Too many rounds, too many times, overuse

Forever scolding me, Don't let the same dog bite you twice
Well I, hell I've just been fooled again
Mama she raised no fool - you did not raise no fool
Mama I ain't no fool - I've just been fooled again
Mama she raised no fool - she did not raise a fool
Mama I ain't no fool
Oh, let me tell you if it happens again like it did next time
Somebody's gonna have to walk the line, walk the line!
(Solo)
She's always telling me, Take my advice boy and just think twice
Forever scolding me, Don't let the same dog bit you twice
Well I, Lord I won't be fooled again
Mama she raised no fool - you did not raise no fool
Mama I ain't no fool - I've just been fooled again
Mama she ain't no fool - I may be crazy but I ain't no fool
Mama you crazy fool - may be crazy but I ain't no fool
Crazy but I ain't no fool, may be crazy, I may be crazy
Crazy but I ain't no fool
