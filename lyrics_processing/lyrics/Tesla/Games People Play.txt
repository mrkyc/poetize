Every night and everyday now
Never meanin' what they say now
Never sayin' what they mean
While they while away the hours
In their ivory towers
To be covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
Oh, we made one another cry
Break our hearts when we say goodbye
Cross our hearts, say we hope to die
'Cept the other one's to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So we gaze at an 8 by 10
Thinkin' 'bout things that might have been
Ow, it's a dirty rotten shame
Latten da latten da da da
Latten da latten da da de
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Latten da latten da da da
Latten da latten da da de
Talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play

Look around, tell me what you see
What's happenin' to you and me
God grant me my serenity
To remember who I am
'Cause you're givin up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity
Ow, when you don't give a damn
