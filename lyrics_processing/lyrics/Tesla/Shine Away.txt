All is well, as it could ever be
All is well, as it could ever be
All is well, as it could ever be
All is well, as it could ever, it could ask for
Me, I told myself that I'd get better, and I knew I would
But I said that a thousand times
Said the same in the letters that I wrote to you
Guess you thought it's that same old line
Ooh I know, but the rest of my soul it don't ever need a reason why
Told myself I'd get over it and over you, never will till the day I die
This won't take long, shouldn't take but a minute
I got you right here in my heart
It's only human, it's only natural, it's love or animal
There you are, so far away, but instead I got it right here in my face
Shine away, shine away, one look at you and I can see the light of day
Shine away, shine away, 'cos I'm afraid of what could happen
If you shine my way, don't you shine my way
Now that it's over, I ask myself the reason why
That (was in the time with you on my mind)
Told myself I'd forget about, forget you
Now it's changed it don't feel so right

Love you so and always will, love to love you even still
Now there you are, so far away, all the while I got it right here in my face
Shine away, shine away, one look at you and I can see the light of day
Shine away, shine away, 'cos I'm afraid of what could happen
If you shine my way
Shine away, shine away, I got somebody sittin' home, waitin' for me yeah
Shine away, shine away, you make it hard for somebody
Who don't want to play, and I want to play
(Solo)
I told myself that I'd get better, and I knew I would
But I said that ten thousand times
Said the same (if time don't make that call for you)
Guess you thought it's that same old line
This won't take long, shouldn't take but a minute
I got you right here in my heart
It's only human, it's only natural, it's love or animal
Now there you are, so far away, all the while I got it right here in my face
Shine away, shine away, one look at you and I can see the light of day
Shine away, shine away, 'cos I'm afraid of what could happen
If you shine my way
Shine away, shine away, I got somebody sittin' home and waitin' for me
Shine away, shine away, shine away, shine away, shine away
