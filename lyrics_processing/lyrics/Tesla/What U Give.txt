Or maybe, who's the one always on your mind?
And who is the reason you're livin' for?
Who's the reason for your smile?
I feel so lonely, yet I know I'm not the only one
To ever feel this way
I love ya so much that I think I'm goin' insane
I'm goin' crazy, outta my head, I'm goin' crazy, outta my head
I can't think about nothin' but your good, good love
And what you give
Everyone needs somebody
And you know, everybody needs someone
Well, and a-yes it's true, everybody needs a special kind of love
And you're the only one I'm thinkin' of
You mean the world to me, you are my only
I feel so lonely, yet I know I'm not the only one
To carry on this way
I love ya so much I lose track of time, lose track of the days
I'm goin' outta my head, I'm goin' crazy, outta my head
I can't think about a-nothin' but your good, good love
And what you give
It's not whatcha got, it's what you give
It ain't the life you choose, it's the life you live
It's only what you give, only what you give, only what you give
It's not whatcha got, but the life you live
