How much reassurance does a man need
Why can't I just let a good thing be
Is it just me? Something don't seem right
In my whole life I've never been so close
To anyone, anything, so girl, I know
I gotta let go and give up the fight
You keep talking like everything's gonna be alright

So why do I feel like you're slipping away?
So dark in my heart girl
Too many times torn apart girl
I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?
Why do I feel?

Trying to understand, explain everything
Over analyze us like we're some game
Trying to find pain, where there's only love
It's maybe just that I've never been this far
Never walked through so many open doors
And when I get more, it's never enough
You and me babe
I know we're right as rain

So why do I feel like you're slipping away?
So dark in my heart girl
Too many times torn apart girl
I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?

Why do I feel like that when it feels like this?
Better than the best it's ever been
Lost in your body here in the dark
Your fingers, my skin: a match and a spark
I told myself I'd make a brand new start

I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Yeah, I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?
Why do I feel?
