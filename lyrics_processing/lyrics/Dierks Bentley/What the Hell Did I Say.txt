Woke up this mornin' with my cellphone ringin'
She said, "I know that when you called me, you were drinking
But I loved every single word you left on my phone
And I know you're hung-over but I'm comin' on over"
Did I say we'd go shoppin', That I'd Louis Vuitton her
That I'd Rodeo Drive her, Slide a Tiffany diamond on her

What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say

Last thing I remember, I was thinking I'd call her up and
Put her on speaker while the whole bar sang Free Bird
Had that phone in my hand when I ran into trouble
My friend comin' over with a couple of doubles

What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say

Did I say we'd go shoppin', That I'd Louis Vuitton her
That I'd Rodeo Drive her, Slide a Tiffany diamond on her?
Did I tell her she could move in and we'd fly out to Vegas
Champagne all the way and we'd get married by Elvis

What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say

What the hell did I say?
