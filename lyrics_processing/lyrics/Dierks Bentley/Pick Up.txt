I dialed seven digits five times today
Just to hear you say you love or hate me
I'll take anything
I just wanna hear your voice
Cut through the line like a heart-shaped knife
Cut me down baby, one more time
Good or bad baby
Yes, no, maybe
It's driving me crazy

Won't you pick up the phone?
I can pick up some wine
I can pick you up in my pickup truck
And we can pick up right where we left off
Ain't that what we both want?
Pick up the pieces girl
It ain't that broke
Pick up the past and just let it go
Put down that over me-never wanna see me again-goodbye kinda stuff and pick up

You're putting me through hell one ring voicemail
Baby I can tell that you ain't on the other line
Accept or decline
How can I tell you if you won't listen?
How can I tell you what I've been missin'?
If you don't, don't, don't
If you won't, won't, won't

Oh, pick up
Put down the mistakes we made
And the words we didn't mean to say

And pick up the phone
I can pick up some wine
I can pick you up in my pickup truck
And we can pick up right where we left off
Ain't that what we both want?

Baby pick up
I dialed seven digits five times today
Just to hear you say you love or hate me (love or hate me)
