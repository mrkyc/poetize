My sun rose in a small town
Where I grew up way too fast
And some beach became my college years
Before it became my past
And California's where I learned to dream
But it never felt like home
It took a whole lot of miles
To find the place where I belong

So won't you come out here with me
And chase this Rocky Mountain freedom?
Let that mile high air you breathe in
Wind you where the river rolls
Yeah, we're born where we're born
But I feel it deep down in my bones
My heart beats in Tennessee
But my sun sets in Colorado

I've danced beside the ocean
Got my blue jeans wet at high tide
My hands have reached for Heaven
From a New York City skyline
Oh, but nothing else compares
To the stardust on the snow caps
It's the kind of place you leave
Then you can't wait to go back

So won't you come out here with me
And chase this Rocky Mountain freedom?
Let that mile high air you breathe in
Wind you where the river rolls
Yeah, we're born where we're born
But I feel it deep down in my bones
My heart beats in Tennessee
But my sun sets in Colorado
Colorado
Come on

Sing an old New Grass song with me
Telluride along with me
Let's show 'em all just how to be
Footloose and wildflower free

Won't you come out here with me
And chase this Rocky Mountain freedom?
Let that mile high air you breathe in
Wind you where the river rolls
Yeah, we're born where we're born
But I feel it deep down in my bones
My heart beats in Tennessee
But my sun sets in Colorado
