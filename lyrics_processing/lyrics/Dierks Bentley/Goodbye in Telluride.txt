Baby, you ain't gotta wait forever
Before you go and break my heart
If you're thinking that we shouldn't be together
Just leave me in the dark a little longer

Do it on the highway, do it on the drive way
Chevrolet backing out
But not here in this cafe booth with you
Don't ruin this perfect town

Say it's over over on the west coast somewhere
In the middle of the city, new years eve time square
If you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright
Just don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride
No, don't take me down low when we're up this high
Don't you tell me goodbye here in Telluride

Ever since we touched down in Colorado
I could tell something wasn't right
'Cause you look at those snow capped mountain
You won't look into my eyes

Do it in a text, better yet in a letter
You can leave my pillow case
You can wreck me back in Tennessee
Anywhere but this place

Say it's over over on the west coast somewhere
In the middle of the city, new years eve time square
If you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright
Just don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride
No, don't take me down low when we're up this high
Don't you tell me goodbye here in Telluride


Do it on the highway, do it on the drive way
Chevrolet backing out
But not here in this cafe booth with you
Don't ruin this perfect town
Don't say it's over underneath this sky so blue
Don't say it's over, have a little mercy girl, won't you?

Say it's over from your window seat on our flight home
Maybe once we get back do it over the phone
If you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright
Just don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride
No, don't take me down low when we're up this high
Don't you tell me goodbye in Telluride
