You can't make a wish, on a star, when they're all burnt out
You can't find that hope, swallowed up, in the deepest dark

The light at the end of the tunnel's a train
You're tied to the tracks with the heaviest chains

Let's chase away, the storms and the rain
And the days of dark (oh-oh-ohh)
Your hand in mine, there's no better time
Or a place to start (oh-oh-ohh)
Let's raise a glass, to the pain of the past
And never look back on these broken hearts
Bright red horizon, the sun started shining
So open your eyes, and let's say goodbye
To the days of dark! (oh-oh-ohh, oh-ohhh)

It's good to feel you kiss, a smile, back on my face
It's good to feel that rush, of blood, back in my veins

Let's dance through the fire, break out of this cage
Let's turn off the music, and let's turn the page

Let's chase away, the storms and the rain
And the days of dark (oh-oh-ohh)
Your hand in mine, there's no better time

Let's raise a glass, to the pain of the past
And never look back on these broken hearts
Bright red horizon, the sun started shining
So open your eyes, and let's say goodbye
To the days of dark! (oh-oh-ohh, oh-ohhh)

Still in the weeds, not out of the woods
But something in my heart
Tells me that this is the start
Of something good (1,2,3,4...)

Let's chase away, the storms and the rain
And the days of dark (oh-oh-ohh)
Your hand in mine, there's no better time
Or a place to start (oh-oh-ohh)
Let's raise a glass, to the pain of the past
And never look back on these broken hearts
Bright red horizon, the sun started shining
So open your eyes, and let's say goodbye
To the days of dark! (oh-oh-ohh, oh-ohhh)
The days of dark! (oh-oh-ohh, oh-ohhh)
