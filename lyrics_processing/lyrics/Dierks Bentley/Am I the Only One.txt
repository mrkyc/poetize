Well it was friday in the p.m
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man Willy said I'd like to really
But Idol's on tv
And Ray had a date
With his wife and Nate quit drinking
But he didn't tell me

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock and roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled who wants to dance and fired up the band with a franklin and a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
"What's it gonna be
Are you gonna let me party alone?"
