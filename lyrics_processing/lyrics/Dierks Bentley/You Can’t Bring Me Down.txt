You can try to wrap your words
Like rocks around my ankles
And push me off a bridge
In hopes that I might drown
Any cheap shots that you got
Yeah, I can handle
You don't get this far without knowing
How to get up off the ground

So I turn up a cold one
And I turn up the volume
On life, on love
On the way I feel right now
Yeah, I learned how to let go
And how to take the high road
I'm on another level
You can't bring me down
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

I'll be the first to say
I've made some bad decisions
I've been a little quick
To call the kettle black
But it's true what they say
About forgiveness
And once you find a man
There ain't nothing that can hold you back

There ain't nothing like
The way my baby holds me
There ain't nothing like this
Sweet piece that I've found
It takes off all the shackles
So save yourself the battle
Yeah, ha, you can't bring me down

I'm gonna turn up a cold one
And I turn up the volume
On life, on love
On the way I feel right now
Yeah, I learned how to let go
And how to take the high road
I'm on another level
You can't bring me down
