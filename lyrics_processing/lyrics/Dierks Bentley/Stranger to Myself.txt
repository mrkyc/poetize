Found some old forgotten photographs, yeah
Looking at them kinda made me laugh, at the
Big hair and the, drunk smile
I ain't seen him in quite a while

I been lucky to live two lives but I
Wouldn't want to live that one twice
Yeah the past is best left on the shelf

I was a stranger to myself
Before you came along
Who I was back then is like an old forgotten song
You showed me who I am
You handed me the keys
And I unlocked the door to the better part of me
Without your love
I'd still be
Someone else
A stranger to myself

Just sitting on the porch with you
Knowing now what I never knew, like
How much more the laughter is, when you
Have someone, to share it with
You stretched this heart of mine
A million miles wide
You wouldn't even recognize the old me

Before you came along
Who I was back then is like an old forgotten song
You showed me who I am
You handed me the keys
And I unlocked the door to the better part of me
Without your love
I'd still be
Someone else
A stranger to myself

Without your love, without your kiss
Showed me what life really is
I never wanna go back there again
To when

I was a stranger to myself
Before you came along
Who I was back then is like an old forgotten song
You showed me who I am
You handed me the keys
