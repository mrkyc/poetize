Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
And never saying what they mean
While they walk away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up in flowers
In the back of a black limousine
La da la da da da da
La da da da da de
I'm a talkin' about you and me
And the games people play
You know we make one another cry
We break our hearts and we say goodbye
We cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other was to blame
We need a woman that will give in
So we gaze at an 8X10
Wanderin' about the things
That might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
La da la da da da da
La da da da da de
I'm a talkin' about you and me
And the games people play
You might also likeNow wait a minute
They come walkin' up to ya
Singing glory haleuajah
Let me try to sock it to ya
In the name of the Lord
They only show ya how to meditate
And to read your horoscope cheat your fate
Furthermore to hell with hate
C'mon and get on board
La da la da da da da
La da da da da de
I'm a talkin' about you and me
And the games people play
Look around baby what'd you see
What's been happening to you and me
God granted it's serenity
Just to remember who I am
Cause you've given up your sanity
Your pride and your bounty
You turn your back on humanity
And you don't give a damn damn damn
La da la da da da da
La da da da da de
I'm a talkin' about you and me
And the games people play
La da la da da da da
La da da da da de
I'm a talkin' about you and me
