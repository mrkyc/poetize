And your dust is bone
You're losing
What you thought you'd know
You live in fear
Your world turns away
You're bleeding
And back on your own
When you had it all
Always ready to fall
There's got to be
Someone to blame
If it's hard to breathe
For your eyes to see
And you want me to bury the pain
Yeah you want me to bury the pain
If I wash away
All the memories and rain
It's screaming
And taking control
The scars and the rage
And you hear it again
I won't go back
I won't go back
You might also likeI've seen this before
I won't lose anymore
It's how you love
It's how you fall
I've seen this before
And I know who you are
It's how you live
And how you fall
Your heart can't trust
Where can you go?
Denying
What's left of your soul?
It never seems clear
The words that you say
They break you
And leave you alone
When you had it all
You stand in your way
There's got to be something to change
You're back on your knees
Cause you can't believe
And you want me to take you away
Yeah, you want me to take you away
If I wash away
All the memories and rain
It's screaming
And taking control
The scars and the rage
And you hear it again
I won't go back
I won't go back
I've seen this before
I won't lose anymore
It's how you love
It's how you fall
I've seen this before
And I know who you are
It's how you live
And how you fall
The scars and the rage
And you hear it again
I won't go back
I won't go back
The scars in the rage
And you feel it again
I won't go back
I won't go back
I've seen this before
I won't lose anymore
It's how you love
It's how you fall
I've seen this before
And I know who you are
It's how you live
