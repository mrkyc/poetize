Don't lock the door behind you
Run and jump into your truck
And hit the gas, burn some rubber up
Yeah, your time's running out, do it now
Take a shortcut, take a back road
Take the shoulder to the exit
Skip the parking, screw the ticket
Hit the curb and leave it sitting
Whatever it takes, you gotta get to that gate
She's crying on a suitcase
Sitting at the airport, waiting on the airplane
'Bout to take her out of here
They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you've still got time
She's crying on a suitcase
Admit it boy, you blew it, really messed it up
You can make excuses if you really wanna lose her
It's all on the line, do or die time
Getting on your knees time
You might also likeTell her that you want her
Need her, love her, gotta have her
Everything good in your life
Begins and ends with her
Lose your pride while you can
Come on, man, be a man
She's crying on a suitcase
Sitting at the airport, waiting on the airplane
'Bout to take her out of here
They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you've still got time
She's crying on a suitcase
She's crying on a suitcase
Waiting on the airplane
'Bout to take her out of here
They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you've still got time
While you've still got time
She's crying on a suitcase
Waiting on the airplane
