It won't be long 'til I end up over there
On your street, at your door, in your arms
In your eyes, in your lies, that fade with sunrise
Girl I need you like a heart needs a break
Girl I want you even if you're bad for me
Girl I need you like the Earth needs a quake
Yeah, I need you like a heart
Like a heart needs a break
Tell a lie, I'll believe you
Make it sound like you really mean it
Doesn't matter 'cause I still need you
Like a heart needs a break
You're the best mistake that I'm falling in
I can never wait to make that same mistake again
On your lips, with your touch, in your world
And you're wet in your bed, sayin' things you already said
Girl I need you like a heart needs a break
Girl I want you even if you're bad for me
Girl I need you like the Earth needs a quake
Yeah, I need you like a heart
Like a heart needs a break

Make it sound like you really mean it
Doesn't matter 'cause I still need you
Like a heart needs a break
Will I get hurt? You gotta have it
Get me high, but then I'm goin' down fast
You can't fight it, I keep burnin' out
But I like it
Girl I need you like a heart needs a break
Girl I want you even if you're bad for me
Girl I need you like the Earth needs a quake
Yeah, I need you like a heart
Like a heart needs a break
Tell a lie, I'll believe you
