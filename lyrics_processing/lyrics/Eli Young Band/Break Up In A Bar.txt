Coulda done it in the driveway
Wave goodbye in my rearview
If you'd have written me a letter
Telling me that it was over
It'd tore me right in two

But you said it wasn't working
Walked out and left me on this stool
But if you gon' tell me goodbye, baby
The place you did, it's pretty cool

They got a hundred different whiskeys
They got my favorite kind of beer
They got more girls than I can count, looking good
Spinning round and round round here
Yeah, girl, you know I'm gonna miss you
And the way you felt here in my arms
But when somebody breaks your heart
Moving on ain't half as hard
When you break up in a bar

You saved me a lot of trouble, hah
A couple tears and a little gas, alright
'Cause i'da just got in my truck
Hit the road and ended up
Right here where I'm already at

I hope you find what you need
