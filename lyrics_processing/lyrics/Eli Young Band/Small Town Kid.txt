Every day, someone asks me
What's my story and what do I like to do
And every day, for the most part, I only go so far
I almost never tell the truth
Cause the truth is behind me, there's not much to give up
I like simple, not complicated

'Cause I'm a small town kid driven by rock music
And some honky-tonk in the mix
I like whiskey in coke, a double to the top
A shot of Cuervo now and then
I never ask for a lot, I'll never need much
Just a good-looking lady who can drive my truck
I'm not afraid to admit I'm that small town kid

City lights, yellow cabs, Yankee hats
Suits and ties everywhere
These city folks, they look at me in my shirt and jeans
And make me think I don't fit in here
Well the things they say might be right
They might be so, but one thing I know
I can't change who I am

Just a good-looking lady who can drive my truck
I'm not afraid to admit I'm that small town kid

Mama, don't you worry, they won't change me
A hundred thousand miles mean nothing to me

'Cause I'm a small town kid driven by rock music
And some honky-tonk in the mix
I like whiskey in coke, a double to the top
A shot of Cuervo now and then
I never ask for a lot, I'll never need much
