Hell Yeah, Amen
Hallelujah, how ya been
8 point, 8 ball
First base, last call
Chrome grill, mudflap
Party back in the pines
Fight song, tom tom
Friday night, pom pom
Redneck, hip hop
County courthouse clock
Beauty shop turnin off that open sign
Anywhere the crossroads hit
(Anywhere the crossroads hit)
Doesn't matter where it is
I can tell ya this

We'll be hittin that Main street hot on a cool night
Sneakin a six pack kiss at a red light
Circlin up out back behind that Texaco
Brushin the blonde hair out of her blue eyes
Countin the stars out under the big sky
Passin the bottle round just to see how far it goes
Some folks swear we ain't got one prayer left inside
But I know everything's gonna be alright
As long as this is goin' on in 10,000 towns tonight

Pulls over as they're passin by

Later on tonight

We'll be hittin that Main street hot on a cool night
Sneakin a six pack kiss at a red light
Circlin up out back behind that Texaco
Brushin the blonde hair out of her blue eyes
Countin the stars out under the big sky
Passin the bottle round just to see how far it goes
Some folks swear we ain't got one prayer left inside
But I know everything's gonna be alright
