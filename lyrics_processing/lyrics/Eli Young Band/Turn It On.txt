Damn girl, I didn't know you'd be here
Been a while, it's sure good to see you
Rollin' in here, ready to rock
Standin' there sippin' that shiner bock
We're pickin' up right where we left off last time
I'll drop a quarter in that jukebox
If you'll dance the way you know I like
In and out of that neon light
And if I kiss you up against the wall, it ain't my fault

Cause I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on

You'll sing along like I'm the only one that's listening
You lit the fuse, now you've got all of my attention
Just let me know when you're ready to leave
Say the word we'll get on this thing
In stereo, little rodeo, baby here we go

Cause I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on
The way you turn it on
The way you turn it on

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
