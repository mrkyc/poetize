Every Sunday I see people
Filing in through those front doors
Got a cross up on that steeple
Yeah, it's time to praise the Lord
Some watch it on their TV
Sittin' on the couch
Me, I get in my old Bronco and point those headlights out
Oh, ain't got too many miles to go
To save my soul

Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Whoa, whoa, yeah

Now there ain't nothing wrong
With puttin' on your Sunday best
Me, I won't be wearin'
Nothin' that I can't get wet
I just think about how small I am and life after we're gone
I'm out here by myself, but I know I'm not alone
Yeah, I got all the proof I need
And it sure makes me believe

Whoa, whoa, yeah

Amen
I'm in heaven watching all these waves roll in
Amen
When I'm lost I know where to get found again

Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
I'm as close to God as I can get
Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set
Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel
