Give me skies of black and blue, the way you make me feel
Give me skies of green and red, cold winds that make it real
Storms are brewing deep within of hurt and loss and pride
It's good to see the world in pain when I take a walk outside

When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, some people get down, they're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain

I don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my TV
I'm not mad at the girl who left 'cause she couldn't be with me
So make up your theories about the scandals and the lies
Start out depressed then everything comes as a pleasant surprise

When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, some people get down, they're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain

When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
