Once upon a time, there were three little pigs
One day, they were old enough to each have a house of their own
But their mother warned them to build their houses strong
So they would be safe from the Big Bad Wolf
Now, the first little pig was lazy
So when he built his house
This is what happened

The first little pig
Built his house of straw
He ran inside
When the wolf he saw

"Little pig, little pig
Let me come in"
"Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed
And he blew the house in

Well, the first little pig ran off as fast as he could
To hide from the Big Bad Wolf
Now, the second pig didn't like to work either
So when he built his house
What do you think happened?
You might also like
The second little pig
Built his house of sticks
The wolf came a-knockin'
Just for kicks

"Little pig, little pig
Let me come in"
"Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed
And he blew the house in

Well, the second little pig ran off into the forest as fast as his little feet would go
Now, the third little pig remembered what his mother told him
So he built his house strong and safe

The third little pig
Built his house of brick
The wolf came along
And he ran inside quick

"Little pig, little pig
Let me come in"
"Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed
But he could not blow the house in
Well ol' Mister Wolf
He was awful bad
He jumped on the housetop
He was really mad
"Little pig, little pig
Down the chimney I go"
But the little pig had a boiling pot of water below
Owoooo!
Look at him go
Owoooo!
Look at him go
