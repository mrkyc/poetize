I just came to get my things
But the pretty lil' thing lying there beside you
Better take off my wedding ring
Hey, girl, do you really wanna do this
You don't know what you're stepping in
He's got more where that came from
You're not so special in the end
I'm messing up the place
Kicking down the door
Never wanna see his face no more
(Ooh, ooh) girl, you better wake up
(Ooh, ooh) girl, you better run
(He's gone) first thing in the morning
Faster than a bullet coming out of that gun
(Ooh, ooh) tells you that he loves you
(Ooh, ooh) then he take it all back
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder 'bout a man like that
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder 'bout a man like that
You might also likeUh-oh, now he's got you
Right where he thinks you belong
Did he bite you on the neck
Right before the job was done
And does he ask about your mama
Does he sing your song when you get mad
Well, I been there, done that many times
And all the kicking and the screaming won't bring him back
I'm messing up the place
Kicking down the door
Never wanna see his face no more
(Ooh, ooh) girl, you better wake up
(Ooh, ooh) girl, you better run
(He's gone) first thing in the morning
Faster than a bullet coming out of that gun
(Ooh, ooh) tells you that he loves you
(Ooh, ooh) then he take it all back
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder 'bout a man like that
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder 'bout a man like that
(Watch out, watch out) he's gonna get you
(Watch out, watch out) he's gonna get you
(Watch out, watch out) he's gonna get you
(Watch out, watch out) he's gonna get you
(Watch out, watch out) we're gonna get you
(Ooh, ooh) girl, you better wake up
(Ooh, ooh) girl, you better run
(He's gone) first thing in the morning
Faster than a bullet coming out of that gun
(Ooh, ooh) tells you that he loves you
(Ooh, ooh) then he take it all back
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder
Girl, you gotta wonder 'bout a man like that
Girl, you gotta wonder
