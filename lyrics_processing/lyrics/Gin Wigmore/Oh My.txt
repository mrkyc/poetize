And I fall down I fall down on my knees I fall
Oh my God, I'm beaten in the game of love
Oh my god, I've been beaten in the game of love
I've had two years in heaven but five weeks in hell
Where do I go now
So I fall to my knees
Praying to God oh help me please
I've had two years in heaven but five weeks in hell
Where do I go now
Oh my lord
And I'm not crazy about the way that you feel
I can't go changing the way that you deal with love
Steppin and stoppin my things
Let me take back a whole lot of those games
Sometimes I go a little crazy thinkin'
Oh my God, I've been beaten in the game of love
I've had two years in heaven but five weeks in hell
Where do I go now
So I fall to my knees
Praying to God oh help me please (help me please)
I've had two years in heaven but five weeks in hell
Where do I go now
Oh my lord
You might also likeAm I'm to die of a broken heart
A good excuse that may never last
But oh no baby you were never there
Never there to cradle my tears
I been once bitten now I won't go back
A timeless act that I keep for fact
And let lie so it won't be wasted thinkin'
Oh my god, I've been beaten in the game we call love
I've had two years in heaven but five weeks in hell
Where do I go now, oh my Lord
Oh my God I'm beaten in the game of love
And I fall down I fall down on my knees I fall
(repeat)
Oh my god, I've been beaten in the game we call love
I've had two years in heaven but five weeks in hell
Where do I go now
So I fall to my knees
Praying to God oh help me please (help me please)
I've had two years in heaven but five weeks in hell
Where do I go now
Oh my god, oh my lord
I'm down on my knees
