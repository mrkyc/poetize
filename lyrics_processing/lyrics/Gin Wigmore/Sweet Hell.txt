Played my heart like 21
Spend my time all crying
Cos I just forget to laugh
Now everyone around me
Is just always trying to sell me
On the notion that you're not the one
That I deserve to have
But if you'd just clean up your act
Tell me what you mean by that
Maybe would should dance one more time
Whoa (Yeah!)
Sweet hell
I'm a little lonely in this tore up town
Sweet hell
Won't you come and find me in this big ole house
Lock the door
So we can bury these bones on the floor
Oh, sweet hell
I'm a little lonely, baby, where are you
You might also likeWell, I got some roses at the door
But who they're from and who they're for
Might just need explaining
So go on and get to that
Well, I can't believe you act like that
Well, I can't believe I want you back
Maybe would should dance one more time
Whoa (Yeah!)
Sweet hell
I'm a little lonely in this tore up town
Sweet hell
Won't you come and find me in this big ole house
Lock the door
So we can bury these bones on the floor
Oh, sweet hell
I'm a little lonely, baby, where are you
