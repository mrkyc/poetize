Change has got me feeling new
Changing my intention for attention from you
I said I faded, faded like the days
Losing my attempt to draw a picture of you

So I get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up, get down

Bad girl taking back the lead
Yeah I'm a bad girl
Got no room to please
Yeah I'm a bad girl
Leave you just to see how long, how long
How long will it take you to show you need a girl like me
Show you need a girl like me

Jaded
Jaded with the weight
Hung up on a yesterday not going my way
But I made it, I made it out alive
The only question now is which direction to choose
You might also like
So I beat up, beat down
Beat up, beat down
Beat up, beat down
Beat up, beat down

Bad girl taking back the lead
Yeah I'm a bad girl
Got no room to please
Yeah I'm a bad girl
Leave you just to see how long, how long
How long will it take you to show you need a girl like me
Show you need a girl like me

Feet don't fail me now
I'm a different lady
Feet don't fail me now
I'm a different lady
Feet don't fail me now
I'm a different lady
Feet don't fail me now
I'm a different lady

Bad girl taking back the lead
Yeah I'm a bad girl
Got no room to please
Yeah I'm a bad girl
Leave you just to see how long, how long
How long will it take you
Bad girl taking back the lead
Yeah I'm a bad girl
Got no room to please
Yeah I'm a bad girl
Leave you just to see how long, how long
How long will it take you
