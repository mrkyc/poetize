Riddle my road
Now I can't find my own way back
Leave me to lie with you chasing my eyes
So I fall for you one last time
How do you know if a pocket of gold
Will ever be enough to say "I do"?

No, now it's too late for lovers
Save me, why won't you save me?
When I gave you my whole world
To leave this holy roller trap
If I only knew the day that I lose would be up to you
Because you know you said forever
Still I am passing through
Cut me a heart from the milkyway stars
To remember when we fell in love
You promised to take me on the carnival ride
But your ring a rosie shot that through
Now nothing you say and nothing you do will ever bring me back to you

No, no it's too late for lovers
Save me, why won't you save me?
When I gave you my whole world
To leave this holy roller trap
If I only knew the day that I lose would be up to you
Because you know you said forever
Still I am passing through
You might also likeYou knew that the gun was loaded
Still you brought me here
Now I am waiting at heavens door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't want to be here
All I see are angels
I am no angel

It's too late for lovers
Save me, why won't you save me?
When I gave you my whole world
To leave this holy roller trap
If I only knew the day that I lose would be up to you
Because you know you said forever
Still I am passing through
Oh it's too late for lovers
Save me, why won't you save me?
Because you know you said forever
