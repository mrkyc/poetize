Take your arms from me
I don't see any other way
Close your eyes to me
Keep my love for me when you go
Don't make this to hard to say
At only 16 still a beauty queen
Lord I'm dying, let me leave

Goodbye, goodbye to all of this
I've got this golden ship
Who said can save me
And tomorrow feels like yesterday
I cannot live this way, I'm sorry darlin'
And I need no more healing
For I can't stop the bleeding
So leave me with this feeling
And let me have this
One more day with you
One more hour for you
I don't see any other way
And don't you see I'm dyin'
Does this explain my crying, hope
I will not see another day
You might also likeI'll save a place for you
Mend your heart
Even if you go out
Don't make this too hard
To say at only 16 still a beauty queen
Lord I'm dying, let me leave

Goodbye, goodbye to all of this
I've got this golden ship
Who said can save me
And tomorrow feels like yesterday
I cannot feel this way, I'm sorry darling
And I need no more healing
For I can't stop the bleeding
So leave me with this feeling
Help me find a way out
A door to keep the pain out
And I can't bear to stay now
At only 16 still a beauty queen
Lord I'm dying, let me leave

Goodbye, goodbye to all of this
I've got this golden ship
Who said can save me
And tomorrow feels like yesterday
I cannot feel this way, I'm sorry darling
Goodbye, goodbye my love
Goodbye, goodbye my love
Release your hands from me
So I can leave
Lastly, I would like to leave with grace
Today is just too hard
