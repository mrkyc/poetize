I was left here to die
I was hell of a ransom
Under cold summer skies
I was told not to love him
I was told not to try
I was lonely the only
Til he said he'd be mine
He will leave me for younger
He will leave me to cry
Cut the knife a little deeper
Count the days I survived
Yeah, it's written in the water
Yeah, it's everywhere I go
Telling me that I should leave you
Like I did two times before
I'll be fine if I met you
When you still have had your own
Give me one kiss for the road boy
I guess it's time I let you go
I will run to the river
I will reach for the well
Drown my sorrows from someone
In my hope I leave this hell
You might also likeI can't live for forgiveness
I can't live with the lie
I won't be what you wanted
No I won't be what you like
Yeah, it's written in the water
Yeah, it's everywhere I go
Telling me that I should leave you
Like I did two times before
I'll be fine if I met you
When you still have had your own
Give me one kiss for the road boy
I guess it's time I let you go
Yeah, it's written in the water
Yeah, it's everywhere I go
Telling me that I should leave you
Like I did two times before
I'll be fine if I met you
When you still have had your own
Give me one kiss for the road boy
I guess its time I let
Yeah, it's written in the water
Yeah, it's everywhere I go
Telling me that I should leave you
Like I did two times before
I'll be fine if I met you
When you still have had your own
Give me one kiss for the road boy
