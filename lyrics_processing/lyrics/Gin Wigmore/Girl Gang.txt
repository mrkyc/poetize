Hit hard, cause a scandal
Can't stop, I'm hard to handle
Don't care if my halo dips
My rise to this is worth the risk
Run fast, put up a champion
One chance to make it happen
Don't care if my halo dips
My rise to this is worth the risk

Work, work, harder, harder
We work, work for the dollar, dollar
Work, work, harder, harder
We work, work

It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world
It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world

I got fight, I got heart
I got the strength to tear it apart
I got bite, I got brains
I got the grace and power to reign

I run, run the high road
I'm back taking my throne
I know the patriarch don't fit the part
What I'm gonna start
See now, I'm the wild one
I stole the bones of Brando
I know the patriarch don't fit the part
What I'm gonna start

Work, work, harder, harder
We work, work for the dollar, dollar
Work, work, harder, harder
We work, work

It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world
It's a girl gang
Boy, you wish you could join
It's a sure thing
We're taking over the world
I got fight, I got heart
I got the strength to tear it apart
I got bite, I got brains
I got the grace and power to reign

Eh, eh
Eh, eh

Those boys, they wish they could join
