Be my woman, gal, I'll
Be your man
Be my woman, gal, I'll
Be your man
Be my woman, gal, I'll
Be your man
Be my woman, gal, I'll
Be your man

At the thought of losing you
I chewed my nail right down to the cuticle
And it's a pain so beautiful
I hurled my lunch right down in the cubicle
And how do I put this
We leave a trail of mistakes in a wake like footprints
Good kids, mad world
But got a feelin' we're making it through, well then I'm waiting for you
Girl

You can take my man, you can take my heart
I'll be ready and waiting for you here
In the streets I live, for the home I have
I am ready and willing to die
You can take my man, can take my heart
I'll be ready and waiting for you here
In the streets I live, in the home I have
I am ready and willing to die

Living In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, the leader driven
By more than money and women, I'm giving what I wasn't
They love it, nothing above it, I'm ready to covet and rub it in
At the end of the world, looking for love again
Young visionary, their vision vary on the contrary
I'm buried alive just trying to feel the vibe
While they're trying to fill the void, young, up-and-coming I was unemployed
Now my name is something that they just cannot avoid

You can take my man, you can take my heart
I'll be ready and waiting for you here
In the streets I live, for the home I have
I am ready and willing to die
You can take my man, can take my heart
I'll be ready and waiting for you here
In the streets I live, in the home I have
I am ready and willing to die

Be my woman, gal, I'll
Be your man
Be my woman, gal, I'll
Be your man
You can take my man, you can take my heart
I'll be ready and waiting for you here
In the streets I live, for the home I have
I am ready and willing to die
You can take my man, can take my heart
I'll be ready and waiting for you here
In the streets I live, in the home I have
