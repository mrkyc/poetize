(Oh wait, I'm gonna do that on the... okay)
Oh let me fold into you
Feel the weight of your skin
It'll be the warm place to hide
Where nobody can get in
I think you like it here in my arms
Don't let your head decide who we are
I think I've found all I can wish for
And then some
I will love you
I will love you
Until the blood all leaves these veins
Don't you let us
Don't you let us
Lose to an early grave
Give me a lifetime
And then fifty more to find the words
That will never explain
How I need you
How I see you
How you are everything that I have
You are the fire to my thoughts
The spark that starts it all
And with your eyes you can move me to your world so far apart
If you die before I do
I know that heartache will kill me too
So if I ever lived again, it will be to find you
You might also likeWhere I can love you
I will love you
Until the blood all leaves these veins
Don't you let us
Don't you let us
Lose to an early grave
Give me a lifetime
And then fifty more to find the words
That will never explain
How I need you
How I see you
How you are everything that I have

So if you die before I do
I know the heartache will kill me too
So if I ever live again
It will be to find you
Where I will love you
I will love you
Until the blood all leaves these veins
Don't you let us
Don't you let us
Lose to an early grave
Give me a lifetime
And then fifty more
To find the words
That will never explain
How I need you
How I see you
How you are everything that I have
How I need you
How I see you
How you are everything that I have
How you are everything that I have
