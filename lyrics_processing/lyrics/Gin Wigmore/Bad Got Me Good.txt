So, you've taken it all from me
Will you sell me back my world and leave me be?
Strange, this is where we are
You have taught me how to live under the scars

I bet you thought that I would lose my reflection in the sea you let me drown
But I can swim without you now

I don't need all the things that you promised to give me
You can keep your broken flowers and the sorry that they came with
'Cause the bad got me good, now I'm stronger without you
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me

Wait, before you crawl to me
Don't forget the memories were bittersweet
Now, now that I've let you go
I can kill the ghost of you inside my head

I bet you thought that I would lose my reflection in the sea you let me drown
But I can swim without you now
You might also like
I don't need all the things that you promised to give me
You can keep your broken flowers and the sorry that they came with
'Cause the bad got me good, now I'm stronger without you
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me

(Give it up boy
Give it up boy
Won't get no tears from me
Give it up boy
Give it up boy
Won't get no tears from me
Give it up boy
Give it up boy
Won't get no tears from me
Give it up boy
Give it up boy
Won't get no tears from me
Give it up boy
Give it up boy)

I don't need all the things that you promised to give me
You can keep your broken flowers and the sorry that they came with
'Cause the bad got me good, now I'm stronger without you
Come on, give it up boy, you won't get no tears from me
