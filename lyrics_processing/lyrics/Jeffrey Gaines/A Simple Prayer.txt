All are sure to fail
But not joining in is an act of betrayal
Betrayal to your king
And all who fought before
The noblest of things is to die in their war
Neither should begin
For everyone will lose
Soldiers of tin
With everything to prove
Who do we oppose
And what do we defend
Honor I suppose
End your simple day
With this simple prayer
Pray they're okay
And in the Lord's care
Pray they return with their faculty
And one day we learn of war's futility
End your simple day
With this simple song
Sing pain away
Hope all are strong
Hope they return
To live happily
And one day we learn of war's futility
Neither side will win
For nothing will be gained
Notify next of kin
Have this casualty claimed
These are words of kings, commanders and chiefs
You hear the same sort of things
From scoundrels and thieves
Neither should begin
For what a price we pay
Soldiers of tin being blown away
Not a lot of grace
Nor majesty
A human disgrace
End your simple day
With this simple prayer
Pray they're okay and in the Lord's care
Pray they return with their faculty
And one day we learn of war's futility
End your simple day with this simple song
Sing pain away hope all are strong
Hope they return to their family
And one day we learn of war's futility
End your simple day
With this simple prayer
Pray they're okay and in the Lord's care
Pray they return with their faculty
And one day we learn of war's futility
End your simple day
With this simple song
Sing pain away hope all are strong
Hope they return to live happily
And one day we learn of war's futility
Neither side will win
All are sure to fail
But not joining in is an act of betrayal
Betrayal to your king
And all who fought before
The noblest of things is to die in their war
Neither should begin
For everyone will lose
Soldiers of tin
With everything to prove
Who do we oppose
