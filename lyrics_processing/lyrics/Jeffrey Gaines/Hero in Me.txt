Given the circumstance
'cause he's protected himself from the world
He never gave it a chance
And he says, here in my security
I've put a limit on my self-potential
And my possibility
She's seen these walls and they never change
Everything's in its place
Her relationships so neatly arranged
Down to religion and race
And she says, here in my security
I don't make a move unless my friends approve
I do what's expected of me
And as I grow older
And there's so much that I do not know
I'm drawn to those who are bolder
And go where no one dare to go
(chorus)
And I sleep and I dream of the person I might have been
Then I'll be free again
And I speak like someone who's been to the highest peaks
And back again
And I swear that my grass is greener than anyone's
'til I believe again
Then I wake and the dream fades away and I face the day
And I realize that there's got to be some hero in me
There's got to be some hero in me
There's got to be some hero in me
There's got to be some hero in me
You might also likeThey've been suppressing their every desire
They do nothing on a whim
She's lost her sparkle and he's lost the fire
Their future looks very dim
And I say, here in my security
I've simply let myself go
I've developed a co-dependency
And as I grow older
So many places that I've never been
Time's tapping my shoulder
I hope it's never too late to begin
(chorus)
And I sleep and I dream of the person I might have been
Then I'll be free again
And I speak like someone who's been to the highest peaks
And back again
And I swear that my grass is greener than anyone's
'til I believe again
Then I wake and the dream fades away and I face the day
And I realize that there's got to be some hero in me
There's got to be some hero in me
There's got to be some hero in me
