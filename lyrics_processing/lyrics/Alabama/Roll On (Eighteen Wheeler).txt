Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on (Roll on)

Well, it's Monday morning, he's kissing momma goodbye
He's up and gone with the sun
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And he's off on a midwest run
As three sad faces gather round momma
They ask her when daddy's coming home
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And they sure miss him when he's gone (Yeah, they do)

Ah, but he calls them everynight
And he tells them that he loves them
He taught them this song to sing

Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on(Roll on)

Well, it's Wednesday evening, momma's waitin by the phone
It rings but it's not his voice
Seems the highway patrol has found a jackknifed rig
In a snow bank in Illinois
But the driver was missing
And the search had been abandoned
'Cause the weather had everything stalled
And they had checked all the houses and the local motels
When they had some more news they'd call

And she told them when they found him
To tell him that she loved him
And she hung up the phone singing

Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on

Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long
Thinking nothing but the worst is coming
With the ringing of the telephone
Oh, but the man upstairs was listening
When momma asked him to bring daddy home
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end
Asking her if she had been singing the song, singing
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy 'til you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on (Roll on)
