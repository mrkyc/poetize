Life sounds better
Life sounds better
Life sounds better with a southern drawl
Life sounds better
Life sounds better

Here's a song for the southland
Chewin' on Redman
It's been all mornin'
Up in the tree stand
Burgers and hot dogs
Livin' for football
Backwoods battle cry made with a duck call
Life's so simple, like sweet ice tea
Here's our down home recipe

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl

We got family tradition, good intentions
Get a little crazy, I love our religion
Apple pie, baseball, honky-tonk, dancehall
We mind our manners and we talk real slow
Down here buddy, that's the way it goes

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl


Country music, mashed potato, nothin' like a ripe tomato
Bible belt to the core, we support our troops at war
Grand Ol' Opry, barbecue, we support Amendment Two
Just about everything is a little better with a twang

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl
We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl

Life sounds better, life sounds better
Life sounds better, life sounds better
Life sounds better, a lotta, lotta better
Life sounds better, a whole lotta better
Life sounds better, life sounds better, life sounds better
A lotta, lotta better, life sounds better, a whole lotta better
A sure 'nuff a better, life sounds better
