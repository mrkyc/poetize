I've got a friend who lives a mile down the road
And she has promised me we will stay gold
I've got a friend who's wide-eyed like me
Oh, what will be, will be

When my fingers can no longer feel
When my eyes can no longer see
When life is turning
I will still pray
(Come give me love, come give me love)

Come give me freedom
Come give me peace
Come lay your head down
And rest at ease
Come give me the body
Come give me all that you can
And by your side I'll stand

I know a place nearby where we used to hide
So many moons ago, you were by my side
I've got a friend who's afraid of the dark
Oh, how it hurts to part
You might also like
When my ears cannot hear a sound
When leaves are falling and a star dies down
When life is turning
I will still pray
(Come give me love, come give me love)

Come give me sunshine
Come give me sea
Come give me air
So I can breathe
Come give me the body
Come give me all that you can
And by your side I'll stand
Come give me summer
Come give me life
Come give me love and will to strive
Come give me the body
Come give me all that you can
And by your side I'll stand
Come give me truth
Come give me time
Come give me knowledge
And peace of mind
Come give me the body
Come give me all that you can
And by your side I'll stand
When my ears cannot hear a sound
When leaves are falling and a star dies down
When life is turning (Come give me love)
I will still pray (Come give me love)
And by your side I'll stay

Come give me freedom
Come give me peace
Come lay your head down
And rest at ease
Come give me the body
Come give me all that you can
