It doesn't hurt me (yeah, yeah, your)
You wanna feel how it feels? (yeah, yeah, your)
You wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (yeah, yeah, your)
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? (yeah, yeah, your)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could
Oh-oh-oh

You don't want to hurt me (yeah, yeah, your)
But see how deep the bullet lies (yeah, yeah, your)
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder (yeah, yeah, your)
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts (yeah, yeah, your)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (yeah, yeah, your)
Tell me, we both matter (yeah, yeah), don't we? (your)

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could
Oh-oh

Come on, baby
Come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience
Ohh-ohh-ohhh

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

You
It's you and me
