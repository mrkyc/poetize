Tryin' hard just to make it in this thing called life
I know it get tough, but everything alright
I give it up to god and I smoke my weed
Eyes Chinese, stay focused on the cheese
Eyes on the prize, like the dream of the king
Eyes on the grind cause I gotta get meat
Get it poppin, get it now, if you can don't wait
Get your mind right, live in the essence, what it take?
You can shine bright with words, in your hand
Don't be scared to fly
Don't be scared to feel
Don't be scared to die
This ain't meant to be no justice, you ain't got to live a lie
Cause' it is what it is, if you can see through God's eyes
I be mad at the world cause there's too much hate
Show and live it in love for my brothers upstate
We all lost hope and tryin' hard to make amends
Wash away all the pains and forgive all the sins

Wash away
All this pain we're feelin' everyday
Wanna see a brighter day
So ashamed..
So much wrong we're doing everyday
Only you can wash away..

Drivin through the city in the middle of the night
I can feel it in the air, pray to god I do it right
I'm a hustler on the grind, everyday another fight
Everybody tryin' tell me how to live my life
Play the hand I was dealt, I can do it by myself
Long as I got you, I'm good, I don't need no help
I do it all if I gotta, all you gotta do is call
Just look over my family, But family should call
All we got is us, in thugs I trust
In the future that may fall, then your gun I bust
You ain't got to worry, I'm a ride to the end
My one and only family, my brothers like kin
We treat em like friends, from buckets to the Benz
From niggas dead broke, to Stack' your motherfuckin ends
We all lost hope, and tryin' hard to make amends
Wash away the pain, and forgive all the sins

(Verse 3: Young Noble)
Wash away the pain, wash away my sins and rain
Never forget, just forgive the game
The way we livin' is strange, stuck in our ways, ain't nobody willing to change, duckin them strays or stuffed in a cage
The block is a maze so we called it a trap
Hip hop is dead, mission to resuscitate rap
I don't write lyrics, I just jot how I'm feelin
It's therapeutic, it's thug music that we give em
And it's straight from the soul, this thug life is sacred that's why we play it by the ancient codes
It's an everyday struggle tryin' to stay above water, shit I do this for my son, I do this for my daughter
Tellin' my lil nigga I love him, I know this life is a test
Less praying when you struggling, more praying when you blessed
Faithful and grateful for all of that I achieve
Raise my seeds to grow...I can die in peace
