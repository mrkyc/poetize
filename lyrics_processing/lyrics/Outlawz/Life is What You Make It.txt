Get up off your ass and get some
Always hollering about you want something nigga
Verse 1: Young Noble
Yo, I've been abducted by the block
But I had to escape
Imagine my fate
Traveling and stacking the cake
After my wake
Bust 25 for me
Cause I'll ride for y'all
And y'all ride for me
I ain't trying to have no sad story in the end
Me and my people all we want is glory in the end
I ain't gonna tell you again
Start thinking about your future nigga
No extra weight cause we ain't got nothing to do with you
If  time is money you wasting the clock
Pacing the block
They hooked now tasting the rock
Thinking of Pac and Yak
So we mash blinded
Gonna be Hell 4 a Hustla
Till the gats find me
And you can ask 1-2
He used to be on new
And you can ask swift gotti
Don't shit get by me
Ask tommy showtime if I did my time
And you can ask L Dog if I ever felt y'all
And ask rock jock if I ever chopped rocks
The block hop
Like Wayne
We remain the top spot
Life is what you make it so we making this spot pop
Life is what you make it so we making this spot pop

23 years of tears
I cry not again

Surprised I'm still living (uh)

Still I remain strong (strong)

Verse 3: Edi
We go to hold on a little bit longer
It feel good
Look my team getting stronger
It seems like we done weathered the storm
But I know all that really means is that it's really on
Oh yes
We been out here
Trying to do my thing
So many niggas hating on us
Driving me insane
Doing that shit behind them closed doors
Talking bout the Lawz
Light some more ??
I penetrate your whole existence with precision
Splitting your wig
Making that bitch a split decision
Thug living although my mama taught me much better
I was addicted to the streets
I couldn't leave until I touched cheddar
And better than my heart
A soul of a rebel
I'm gonna do it my way
I ain't never ever gonna settle
I got my niggas and my metal
We all on a mission
The goal is to get dough
And stay cold
Keep tripping'
Come on
