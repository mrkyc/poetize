Loyalty....
Some of yall niggas dont even know what the fuck that is
A whole lot of niggas (yeah)
Some of yall niggas'll never know Loyalty
Wanna hate on me?
Nigga fuck you and yo family
I stay true to what I know and thats Outlaw (who?)
It ain't no me in this muthafucka without yall
We went from nothing to something
Hustlin' and bubblin'
And ain't ask niggas for nothin' (shit)
Shit that made other cliqs I split
Made us tighter
Fuck the industry
Cause I ain't no dick rider
You see me nigga
I ain't lost a pound
Still eatin', still breathin'
Still reackin' off that cali shit
And I ain't never want muthafuckas to handle shit
You see me pushin' .22's?
Nigga handle it
Feelin' good like we just won a championship
New money, new label
Keep it crackin' bitch
And I'ma get the last laugh
You can count on it
And stay away from you mutherfuckas that's counterfeit
Loyalty..................... snitch ass nigga
You might also like
Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?

It's like a jungle sometimes
We keep on hustlin'
But they wanna take us under, under, under

God damn I'm glad you set it off
Used to be hard
Now you just went soft
Poison, young nigga, bitch to society
Once had love for em
Why the fuck he lied to me?
Kicked out the crew cause his soul ain't strong
Started sniffin' herion
Nigga you wrong
And I ain't never hang around fag ass niggas
Rappin niggas alseep in the county ass niggas
My family strong like the mafia
It ain't no thang to put a slug thru ya
Scary ass nigga
Damy ass nigga
Won't throw rice in a wedding ass nigga
Loyalty
I can't stand the fake and the snake never
Worse the betrayal
You scared of the heat muthafucka?
Stay away from the barrel
And I ain't never been a rat
Or been scared to ride
A lot of niggas act tough
But know they pie inside
Death before dishonor
But you really scared to die
We could spit a verse about you
We put yo life on the line
Military mind ain't never put his nose on the line
A real souljah never retreats
When it's time for a crime

Hey yo....
You can talk that shit
But how many of yall can do what we did?
Muthafuckas talkin' bout the Lawz ain't shit
Bitch ass nigga should get off the Lawz dick
Muthafuckas mad that we got our own label
Outlaw Recordz, we ain't fuckin with you haters
Niggas know the Lawz been holdin' this down
If you dont see him now
We dont fuck with that clown
Loyalty... (uhuh)
Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?

It's like a jungle sometimes
We keep on hustlin'
But they wanna take us under, under, under

What's Loyalty?
When a nigga say he love you
But all awhile he dont think nothin' of you
And that's just what love do
Stab ya in the heart
Grab you in the dark
And rip families apart
Damn... we was supposed to be fam
We had plans
Now I claim to understand you
I guess life is a gamble
I shook the dice
But I betted on the peasent
Then I took a dive
Like oohhhhh....
How come I ain't know
I should've seen it was simply soul
Now I know.... what's loyalty
It's all clear to me
These words is for the birds
You ain't real to me
Life is a liar
Got me spinning like the tires
Hug a drunk driver, back and forth
You ain't ready and you petty
So I laugh it off
But it's a cost to be the boss
You gon' pay for not being loyal

My life's a blessin'
My life's a lesson
And if it's ride or die
There ain't no question
Ain't no time for second guessin'
We ain't bustas
Niggas ain't new to this shit
We some muthafuckin' ridahs
And yall niggas is the opposite
I sense bitch like a dog sense fear
So yall better act right
Anytime that I'm near
Live in yo ear
Everyone's a ridah in here
Cross game
Watch them ridahs appear
Muthafucka

Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
