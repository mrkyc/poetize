Yeah
So hard... to imagine
God in action
So hard... to imagine
God in action
So hard, yeah, so hard, yeah

So hard to imagine
The things before they happen to you
What if you was all that it knew, true
So hard to imagine
Where will I be this time next year
Here or there somewhere, yeah

I hope, I don't miss it, all blisted, twisted
Fall victim, to hits and stick-ups
Thinkin' of how they did my nigga figures
Hard to imagine, god in action
Large relaxin' hard with a matchin' for every card
Naw, what about when you think
How the fuck you really get here
And how we get white, how we get black and how we get that nappy head?
Harassed and everywhere the fuck we go
I don't know, what about when you could picture ica
Make your mind blow, kaboom
Mine might be soon, times fight me like, get away get away
Long nights on airplane flights
I be imagining Pac and beg free, lockin' it down
Poppin' from sea to sea, so mother-fucking happy
Tap me if this is just another dream
Once again I'm trapped in that dimension
That I ain't got no business in, damn
So many wishes, all this bait and no fishes
I can't take these bitches, so I stay suspicious
Makin' my melon imagine
You might also like
So hard to imagine
The things before they happen to you
What if you was all that it knew, true
So hard to imagine
Where will I be this time next year
Here or there somewhere, yeah

I see these suckers on the creep
So now I gots to get on my feet
Regulate these player-hatin' niggas
Cause these hoes disagree
But ain't just me that think this game should be sold
It's plenty, so many, but it won't be any
If this fame ain't remote
Could explode, i'm told i'm trapped cause i'm black
I'll be stuck up in prison
I won't be livin, cause the way that I act
But i'm reacting kind of wacky saying "go on with that shit"
And every minute my niggas in prison
I'm screaming "don't trust no bitch"
I'm kind of sick but still in all i'ma hold shit down
I'm seein' stress by the pound
And every day i'm screaming "come help me now"
Been waking up, plenty tears for years
I'm a fighter, excited, because it's all for my peers
I'm still worrying and struggling
Cause these times getting hard
I see me hustling and bustling, getting paid by the yard
It's hard to imagine, nigga (haha)
So hard to imagine, yeah (yeah)
So hard to imagine
The things before they happen to you
What if you was all that it knew, true
So hard to imagine
Where will I be this time next year
Here or there somewhere, yeah

Can you picture this day, the day where we get paid
The day when our shit's made
The day when our folks
Quit acting like hoes and being bitch made
Nah, not me it's kind of hard to imagine
Cause niggas be loving that drama
It's like they fiend for the action
Don't ask me why
I'm just praying it pass me by
Cause I seen niggas leave this game fried
And now I see why
My big homie said "don't mess with this shit"
And every day on the phone from the pen
I heed the message he kicked
The lesson he spit, is thick with game for sho'
About how to travel this life without no pain no more
But I ain't so sure, so i'm rolling through this nervous
Trying to figure really what my worth on this earth is
And is there a purpose to my presence, and after my death
Will my essence be blessed with remembrance
And I have to mention
These be the thoughts unthinkable, hard to imagine dreams
But I seek 'em true, uh
So hard to imagine
The things before they happen to you
What if you was all that it knew, true
So hard to imagine
Where will I be this time next year
