Y'all can't do
Y'all can't do like the Outlawz do
Y'all can't do like the Outlawz do
Y'all can't do like the Outlawz do
Y'all can't, y'all can't
Y'all can't do

I heard a rumor that them Outlawz died
Came back alive and started spittin' fire
Changed up our dollars
Then we flicked 55
Life of a true grinder
Give me mines
Ain't no time for you to run
Get ya nine
Throw 'em from the shoulders
Like they do in '89
It's cool, it is now 2002
These niggas play with guns leave a bullet in ya
Them Outlawz sprung off the money
Ain't a breast wit' the ass
Shit stay cocked cause I gotta get the cash
Fresh off the plane, I'll arrive anyday
Go to the same block where my niggas sell yaay
Slang them A-K's where they don for the day
And y'all can't do it this way, no way
This Napoleon, strength for the strong
Y'all ain't knowing
'Pac ain't ?? we continue to ?? nigga
You might also like
(Y'all can't do)
Shit to us..
Make sure ya show respect when you mention us
Cause when you test the Lawz, you testing God
And everybody die hard nigga
(Y'all can't do)
What the Lawz could do
I dont wanna send the dogs for you
Have a call for you
It ain't no telling what the Lawz'll do
Nigga I thought you knew -- that
(Y'all can't do)

Y'all can't do what we do
Outlawz Recordz this is true
Slide thru tatted up, gatted down (uhooo)
How's ya main thang cause she gone get fooled
Bounce, rock, roll, thug
Sittin' in the back of the Lincoln, blowing bud
Two semi's, for them niggas too friendly
I got 2 dimes
Enough time and Im ready baby
Introduction to the Outlawz lifestyle
Go crazy, throw bo's, wild out now
Fuck holding back
Tired of being held down now
Chrome make 'em feel us anyway that we can now
Hey yo I creep thru ya block late night with a 5th
Creep thru ya spot, game tight for ya bitch
Niggas like Nobe where the fuck you been?
Overseas doing shows for the ends, we hustle hard
Outlawz Recordz coming thru, with muscle dog
Slam dance at a Lawz show, they love it hard
Thug walk with a drink in my palm
Crip walk, blood walk, to this song
I need a brew nigga dont get pissed on
And my crew on some ol' other shit dog
Outlawz we ain't fuckin' with you
I thought my homegirl told you

(Y'all can't do)
All the shit we do
Why the fuck you tryin' to tell us all the shit we knew
Cause when the shit hit the fan
Ya cliq did too
Now everybody gonna miss you
(Y'all can't do)
All the shit we done
We was there before
Now we back to number one
We got about a long run
Outlawz muthafucka we the wrong ones
(Y'all can't do)
Outlaw... Outlaw... remember that? (huh!)
'Trade War Stories', 'When We Ride', remember that? (huh!)
'Hail Mary', who the fuck made that?
Who the only squad alive that could bring 'Pac back?
We do it how we do it
Y'all can't do that (nah)
Try on these shoes get ya wig blew back
It's Thug Life baby, and already knew that
It's a daily operation, dog we rep it like that
I got a line in my pocket
That shoot up many rockets
So, forget about it
Doing deals with mobsters
That'll pop you in the head
With a bottle of Vodka
If we see some shit up out cha
We beat it up out cha
This is how we do, one rowdy crew
Kadafi up in this, Makaveli is too
So stop tryin to do what y'all can't do
Please take my advice, it's true

(Y'all can't do)
Shit to us..
Make sure ya show respect when you mention us
Cause when you test the Lawz, you testing God
And everybody die hard nigga
(Y'all can't do)
What the Lawz could do
I dont wanna send the dogs for you
Have a call for you
It ain't no telling what the Lawz'll do
Nigga I thought you knew -- that
(Y'all can't do)

East Coast niggas know they thug with the Lawz
Down South niggas get crunk with the Lawz
All my up North niggas give it up for the Lawz
West Coast niggas throw they dubs for the Lawz
East Coast niggas know they thug with the Lawz
Down South niggas get crunk with the Lawz
All my up North niggas give it up for the Lawz
