For the money I mean mug
You hog and I'll hold a grudge
Then I'll meet you in the parking lot
Hand you some slugs
Fuck a solution, it ain't none
Nigga I can't run
It's something gonna be done
Then fuck it lets dump some
You wastin' your breath
And I'm surprised there's some left
I got my nine on your chest
And you got your mind on your death
And I got this shit up inside of me (Inside of me)
Holdin' on like its riding me (Ridin' me)
Telling me to get this money
Fuck y'all cause you trying me

Dirty jersey only breed, killers and dogs
Since I'm both I'm in your driveway with a gauge in the fog
Ain't shit sweet about a nigga from Newark
Accept the not guilty verdict that you hear in the court
Bang you from the car rockin' Me Against the World
And the blood from your face fly and land on your girl
