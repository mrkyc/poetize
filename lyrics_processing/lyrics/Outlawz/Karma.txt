Yeah, Five Thirteen, it's a movie, muthafucka
Yeah, Outlawz, Snoop Dogg, real gangsta shit
Yeah, let's go

What do we have here now? Outlaw Ridaz and the Dogg Father
We just came to collect from you style biters
Lil' homies similar to them Al Qaedas
Young bulls off the leash, and they will bite ya
Project roof with the beam, yeah they will snipe ya
Time to pay the piper, this for them three-strikers
We got soldiers from Pelican Bay to Riker's
Young thugs throw they dub up, wanna be just like us
Long Beach to Jersey, ain't no limits, I'm like Percy
No love for these hoes, we ain't thirsty
My Makaveli and Kadafi live on
Real soldiers never fall, we keep pushin' along
And we prob'ly ain't involved unless it's paper involved
This official as it get, Snoop Dogg and them Outlawz
Born on the West, raised on the East
Best of both coastses, voice of the streets, let's go

Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around, comes around (comes around)
What goes up, yeah it's comin' down (comin' down)
And if that bitch can't swim, then she bound to drown
Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around, comes around (comes around)
What goes up, yeah it's comin' down (comin' down)
And if that bitch can't swim, then she bound to drown

Out of 25 niggas, 20 gon' try to kill ya (bang)
Then outta them five, two don't really feel ya (bang)
Then outta them three, one gon' get familiar (bang)
Then outta them two, they gon' set ya up to kill ya (that's karma, that's karma, bang)
What's done in the dark'll come to the light
You used to pull up, mob on them boys
The tables done turned 'cause you run in the night
Death to my enemies, slaughter opposers
One in your face, it's sort of a closure
Bang, bang (karma, karma), now nobody knows ya
Bang, these niggas ain't nothin' like us
They ain't gon' bust a grape in a fruit fight, so
Why these niggas actin' so tough?
I done played around, got fronted on
Hit the ground but now I'm back up
But there comes a time in the middle of the rhyme
When actor stop and you fucked, nigga (fucked nigga, nigga, nigga)
That's karma on ya muthafuckin' head, nigga (head, nigga)
I'm finna paint you red, and you dead, nigga
Actions speak louder than words, but ain't nobody talkin'
I come through with karma in the  and get to
Ba-ba-ba-ba-barkin' on these niggas

Work-work-workin' on these niggas
Talkin' on, stalkin' on, C-walkin' on these niggas
Lurkin' on these niggas
Breakin' bread, take ya meds
To sustain my mindframe
Dogg Pound, that's my gang
Daylight my time change
Taste like that Bombay
Spray like that nine bang
Always do my thang
Niggas know 10 to 4, stay high, way high
But I can make a drink up out it
I can make you think about it
DPGC, Outlaw Immortalz
Smash that, flashback
Get yo tape recorders
Push play, good day
Get more money
Pussy, roll it up, and it betta be that kushy
Com-comin' through, thirty deep, no creep
All guns, all hot
King James, all heat
So bow down to the bow wow
The shit gets no reala
Long Don, King Kong
Bitch, I'm Godzilla
Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around, comes around (comes around)
What goes up, yeah it's comin' down (comin' down)
And if that bitch can't swim, then she bound to drown
Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around (EDIDON), comes around (comes around)
What goes up, yeah it's comin' down
And if that bitch can't swim, then she bound to drown

What go around, come around, we back and 'bout to bubble
O-4-L and D-O-Double, you know it's nothin' but trouble
You know we gon' hustle, from here to abroad
If you mad at the grind, then you prob'ly a broad
Look at the way that I shine, it's a sight to behold
A-1 from the jump, never snitched, never told
Stay up on my toes, peepin' game is a must
Livin' my life on the move, it's only a few I can trust
So rare, it's like I'm not even here
Until they see me in the flesh
Then they know that it's real
So clear, no clouds, like a VVS
No challenge, know Cali, but we still the best huh
Let 'em have it like a spree, no brown, all green
It's a small thing to a outlaw, Don King
We still gettin' to keep the movement like 18 Wheelers
Stay away from squealers and bullshitters
It's them niggas
Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around, comes around (comes around)
What goes up, yeah it's comin' down (comin' down)
And if that bitch can't swim, then she bound to drown
Man up or man down, stand up or stand down (down)
You know the rules, what goes around, comes around (comes around)
What goes up, yeah it's comin' down (comin' down)
