OG Scarface in this
5-30
Meh
Outlaw for life
Yeah
Let's go!
:
Geto Boy from the start, I'll be man when I finished
Ask a question if you really wanna an answer my nigga
Game sold not told, so we sell it in rhyme
It's an everyday struggle in this thing called grime
Damn shame life expectancy for young black males
Is twenty-one, by seventeen they have em in jail
Facin' life for some murders he ain't even commit
But the court-appointed fucked him, so they givin' him this
Mamma cryin' but it's all done, she loosin' her son
It's a black thing, these white boys is havin' they fun
Playing God with your freedom look at how the did Lun
I left it back a Harris county, he was fightin' him one
And Mario took the fire out he just waited on chain
They done passin' out them 40's, niggas think its a game
And the first thing we say is we gon' take it to trial
And these judges got the nerve to look at niggas and smile
And the cops steady crushin' us, settin' us up
Dope case after dope case, fuckin' us up
Kids grow without father, prolly visit the jail
Until his baby mama find another nigga she feel
Playin' chess pass the time, tryin' think of a rhyme
Young celly on his bunk, tryin' to keep him from cryin'
Born sinners, God forgive us, we don't know what we do
I'm just an Outlaw, a lost cause callin' on you
Cause I'm a sinner
You might also like:
Bread winners, Born Sinners
Only God can judge us, will he forgive us?
For all the traffickin', blastin' in a crime scene
The game dirty, ain't no comin' out clean
Watch the signs
Getcha yours while you watchin' mine
Outlawz built the last, this was by design
Yeah
You better rise when it's time to rise
Better step up to the plate when its time to shine
:
I ain't got time for your chest on a rhyme
In the streets while your baby mama fucking for a dime nigga
Every fuckin' line nigga rhymin' 'bout a crime
But you know this nigga lyin' cause he ain't never did no time
Sinner...
I get it on like I get I on
Big dick nigga, your girl face I'ma sit it on
And if this nigga don't stop frontin' like he get 'em gone
I make a phone call and I get`em gone
These niggas be comin' so different I know it
I roll me a fat one, I listen, I blow it
I roll me another one and take a seat
These niggas is nothin' they bluffin' on beats
They rappin' bout nothin' important and frontin' on my history so they nothin' to me
And I bang on'em
And I'ma bang 'til I hear em cryin'
Two guns up, west coast, somebody here been lyin'
Brick city shit nigga, after hours blackbox
The new 63 doors open like a matchbox
Eh
:
:
Outlawz and the Facemob, grindin' is my day job
We used to stash dimes inside a tennis ball
Slid it open, toss it in the grass, till the narcs pass
5-13 white Mike usually hit the ave
Cop it all from me, we kept it raw and chunky
Stepped on, you dead wrong thinkin' you can fuck with me
I know they wanna get me, but I ain't hard to find
H-town to dirty Jerz with a dirty nine
You better watch the signs, do what the song say
When you gettin' paid, every day is a long day
Folk in the road, goin' right might be the wrong way
Struggle is the same from raw way to Norway
London to Germany, France out to Paris
The theme of the hood, so this music is a marriage (let's go)
Ghetto bastard, way above average (yeah)
Outlaw till they coverin' casket
:
Life is short and you only got
A limited time to make it pop
Got to be on the court to take a shot
Gotta be in the game to get hot
Never know when might be your turn
Don't listen now you won't learn
Think you know where you goin' but you headed for trouble
Now I'ma tell you the truth, you better swerve
Look out, temptation around every corner
I'm a survivor, I'm stronger
Sippin' a honey Jack, blowin' on marijuana
Still I'm so focused, the finish line is closer
Closer to my dreams I can see it please believe
Hard work and dedication like the Money Team
No shorts, no losses, whole click bosses
Born sinner, turned winner y'all can witness
Big bidness, eight figures, Made Niggas in this
Spendin' this money cause we damn sure can't take it wit us (no)
Late night, high life, will the Lord forgive us? (huh)
Spendin' this money cause we damn sure can't take it wit us
Late night, high life, will the Lord forgive us?
