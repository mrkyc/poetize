Outlawz... could never touch the kids in the ghetto man
That's where I'm from..... man

This is our life
Even tho' the sun dont always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
In living your life

I'm damn near 'bout to go in tears
Writin' this verse here
I feel like I'm cursed here
I'm choked up since I lost my peers
But I know one day we be back again
One love to my Mexicans
Tryin' to run across the border
To see freedom all over again
Man... One love to my Africans
They try to kill us with AIDS
But they smart again
It's like I die once that I be born again
With the grace of Allah
Kept away my sins
From the ghetto where they play with heavy metal to win
Lost my parents so I moved with my next-of-kin
Life.... just so mych pain to me
To tell the truth I dont wanna die angrily
Makaveli and Kadafi, them trained me
I feel yall in the dark steady hatin' me

This is our life
Even tho' the sun dont always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
In living your life

In '96 we was on top of the world
Videos, movies, money, jewels and girls
Rolls Royces, Hummers, Jagz and all that
Hard to believe one night in Vegas changed all that
Fast forward... 6 years
Man, we still here
Despite be hated on (huh)
We still clear
Until the end of time you can't stop destiny
Back for everything they owe
Now let's go

I got the spirit of a angel
The heart of a soldier
The mind of a militant
Was blessed by my mother
The inspiration of my life
She 4 years clean
With 15 years on the pipe
And she just got married
I felt pain... ya sayin' Pac smilin' at the wedding
Never forget her mah'
Yall baby fool, I promise to ya I'mma stay a trooper
Outlawz done die
We forever move
This is our life
Even tho' the sun dont always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
In living your life

Oh... I'm on, pens and needles
Needles and pens
These 2 Tims was my Beemer
Before I heard of a Benz
I got lost tryin' to find my ends
And got crossed tryin' to find me a friend
That's life....
We sacrifice for better days
We pray for a better way that never came
Hey! (hey.. hey)
What's more precious then a innocent child, smilin'
??? was foul, look at his smile
School's not cool
Them big body rules
The workin' mans a fool
If he can't afford the jewels
Look at how life use ya
Abuse and confuse ya
Remember we was suppose to be the future?
Now we grown
The future is here and we gone
Oh where did we go wrong
Let's live...
And do right by these kids my friend
They the only shot we got at living life again
C'mon
This is our life
Even tho' the sun dont always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
