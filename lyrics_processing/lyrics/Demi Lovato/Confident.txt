Are you ready?
Ha

It's time for me to take it, I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it, not when you go down
'Cause this is my game
And you better come to play (Come to play)
I used to hold my freak back, now I'm lettin' go
I make my own choice, bitch, I run this show (Bitch)
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave (Ha, ha, ha)

(Oh-oh-oh)
So, you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated, rated, rated (Uh-huh)

What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein'
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)
What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein'
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)

It's time to get the chains out, is your tongue tied up?
'Cause this is my ground and I'm dangerous
And you can get off
But it's all 'bout me tonight (Tonight, ha, ha, ha)

(Oh-oh-oh)
So, you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated, rated, rated (Uh-huh)

What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein'
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh, yeah)
What's wrong with bein' (Yeah), what's wrong with bein' (Yeah)
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)
What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein'
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)
What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein'
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)

Uh-huh
Hey
Ah, yeah
So, you say I'm complicated
But you've had me underrated
Yeah, yeah (Uh-huh)

What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein' (What's wrong with bein')
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)
What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein'
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Oh, yeah, uh-huh)
What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein' (What's wrong with bein')
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)

What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)
