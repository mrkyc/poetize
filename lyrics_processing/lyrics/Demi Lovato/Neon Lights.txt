Baby, when they look up at the sky
We'll be shooting stars just passing by
You'll be coming home with me tonight
We'll be burning up like neon lights

Be still, my heart, 'cause it's freaking out
It's freaking out right now
Shining like stars, 'cause we're beautiful
We're beautiful right now
You're all I see in all these places
You're all I see in all these faces
So let's pretend we're running out of time
Of time

Baby, when they look up at the sky
We'll be shooting stars just passing by
You'll be coming home with me tonight
And we'll be burning up like neon lights
Baby, when they look up at the sky
We'll be shooting stars just passing by
You'll be coming home with me tonight
And we'll be burning up like neon lights
(Neon lights, neon lights, neon lights)
Like neon lights, oh
Like neon lights, oh
