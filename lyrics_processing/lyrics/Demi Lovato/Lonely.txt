Mmm, ooh, yeah
Mustard on the beat, ho

He felt just like you
His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip, it fit, though I admit that
Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though, you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye

You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checkin' on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hopin' and prayin'
My knees weak, I'm shakin'
'Cause you know that I always needed savin'

Now I'm fuckin' lonely 'cause you didn't want me
Tryin' to show me, that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fuckin' lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleedin'
For no goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely

The month was June
The smoky sun, our fated one
It ended too soon
With tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
Blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
I can see it in your eyes

You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checkin' on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hopin' and prayin'
My knees weak, I'm shakin'
'Cause you know that I always needed savin'

Now I'm fuckin' lonely 'cause you didn't want me
Tryin' to show me, that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fuckin' lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleedin'
For no goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Bitch, can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around, get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothin' there, because
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was startin' to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves
I'm fuckin' lonely, yeah

Lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
