I've always been the kind of girl that hid my face
So afraid to tell the world what I've got to say
But I have this dream, bright inside of me
I'm gonna let it show, it's time to let you know
To let you know

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me

Do you know what it's like to feel so in the dark?
To dream about a life where you're the shining star?
Even though it seems like it's too far away
I have to believe in myself, it's the only way

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me
You might also like
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
I need to find you, I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you, I gotta find you

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am (Yeah)
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be, yeah

This is me
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
This is me, yeah
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
