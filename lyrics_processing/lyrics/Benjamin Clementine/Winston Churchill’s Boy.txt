Had so much been given for so few attention
Never in the field of human affection
Had so much been given for so few attention
Winston boy
Oh! There he is
Packing, quietly
Alone
You could mistake a clock ticking
For a cricket cricketing when you're around him
But I swear!
Nobody knows, nobody knows what's on this boys mind
And nobody sees, nobody sees what he's been picturing
"We all make a living by what we get
But we make life by what we give, by what we give
But in some special circumstances
This special circumstance
Winston Boy will have to earn a living
Before he earns enough living to give"
"Where is your family?
Where are your loved ones?" Someone uttered
Whilst he went on crossing the Channel
"Well, they say no man can be a prophet
In his own country, so I left, here I am
Come on embrace me, hold me!
I am your brother!"
Now whilst he kept on talking
In his left pocket layed the prose of the magnificent Orwell
His right hand embraced a battered
Guitar borrowed
"Borrowed from me!"
Come to think about it, I think a few years ago
I heard him talk about how God blessed an eagle with 54 stars
And maybe he's gone he's gone wondering
Looking for his kind of star
But even stars
If we think about it, even beautiful stars
They tend to shoot through the night
And you never find them again!
Never and never and never again!
And so don't you judge Winston Boy
Don't you ever judge Winston boy

Though clearly nobody knows when or how
One day this boy will stand in front of a pulpit
As the world gives him but a minute
And there he will tell the world
Where he's been and how
Underground to upper ground in the depths of
I will surely survive
He shares his story with a cup of tears streaming from his eyes
One day this boy will be fine
One day this boy will be fine
