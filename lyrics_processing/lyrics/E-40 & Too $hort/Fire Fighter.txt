Ayy, 40, I don't know if they ready for this, mayne
E-40 and Too $hort in this thang, nigga
ShonuFF on the motherfuckin' slap, NOW!
We got Knotch in here on this motherfuckin' pimpin'
It's game involved in everythin' we do

He in the party talkin' loud like he always do
On like a motherfucker, him and his crew
Knife in his dreads, Derringer in his shoe
Walkin' in limpin', him and his crew
Feelin' it, fame and fetti
Sittin' at the bar with his fingers in her panties (What else?)
Leanin' (Leanin'), noddin' off
Tryna convince her, to give him some boss (BIATCH!)
Sophisticated broad, love to twerk
Especially when she hear E-40 and Too $hort
When people hear they music, they go dumb
Bring the gangsta out a square, bring the ratchet out a nun
Bein' broke sucks, but ballin' is fun
That's why I stay tucked, with my gun
She lit like a candle, her va-jay-jay on fire
She want me to sprinkle her, I'm the firefighter

She said she's on fire
Callin' me firefighter
She said she's on fire
Callin' me firefighter
And I put her out
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Callin' me firefighter
You might also like
I'm like CO2
I do all the things that he won't do
You can laugh at me, call me a liar
But when she's on fire, I'ma ride her
I'm in side her, no lyin'
On my dick, got her screamin' like a siren
I drive thru like In-N-Out
I fuck her real good then I'm out (BITCH!)
'Cause I only want one thing
Sign my name on the sheets with a cum stain
And if you want some more of me
Dial 9-1-1 when you're horny (I'm on it)
As soon I walk inside, we startin' it
That's where you call the whole damn fire department
That pussy is so hot
I ain't never gon' stop

She said she's on fire
Callin' me firefighter
She said she's on fire
Callin' me firefighter
And I put her out
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Callin' me firefighter
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She burnin' (She burnin')
She burnin' (She burnin')
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She burnin' (She burnin')
She burnin' (She burnin')

She said she's on fire
Callin' me firefighter
She said she's on fire
Callin' me firefighter
And I put her out
Out, out, out, out, out, out
