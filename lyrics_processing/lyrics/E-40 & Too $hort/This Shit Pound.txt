Uh, when I entered the world and took my first breath of air
The doctor gave me a blunt and a 40 ounce of beer
Sat me in the chair, told me to prepare for the worst
He said, "Life can be good and life can stink like a burp"
There's gon' be a lot of back-stabbin' and betrayal (And betrayal)
So always pack a hammer and some nails (And some nails)
As I got older, I hung around older folk (Older folk)
That's why I'm so dope and spit the game I pope (Game I pope)
I used to practice lookin' hard but now I practice bein' solid (Solid)
I keep , can't let 'em catch me out of pocket
Haters'd love to sneak me and try to remove me from Earth
But if I find out who's schemin', they gon' get hauled off in a hearse
I'd rather be judged by twelve than to be carried by six
I said it befo' and I meant it (I meant it)
This thing wringin', it's rotten, it's beatin' they ass like a belt
If you ain't slappin' E-40, you need to slap yourself

My partner from the V, my nigga from the Town
Roll that shit up, nigga, pass it around
All in the game like we pitchin' off the mound
Four in the box and you know that shit pound
My-my-my partner from the V, my nigga from the Town
Roll that shit up, nigga, pass it around
All in the game like we pitchin' off the mound
Four in the box and you know that shit pound, that shit pound

Substitute verse licks for the cocaine (Verse licks for the cocaine)
Some of you niggas need to be potty-trained (Potty-trained)
I'll beat you with my belt like Pootie Tang

It's just another sunny day in the Golden State (Golden State)
My other money's made when the hoes get paid (Hoes get paid)
I keep it in my sock, spend it when I shop
Everything you want is everything I got
Why you stallin', won't you gimme the scratch (Gimme the scratch)
Never ask how a real pimp gets sacks (Sacks)
When you get it from the Bay you just got it like that
If you grew up on E-40 and them Short Dog raps, you a mack

When you was a lil-ass kid
In the car seat listenin' to some E-40
Mom and daddy bumpin' Too $hort
In the old school
