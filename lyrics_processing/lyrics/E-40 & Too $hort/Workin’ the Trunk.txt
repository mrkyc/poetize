E-40! 40 Water!

I came in this thing outta here, loaded, hella bent
Intoxicated, everywhere I go I leave my scent
I'm hella faded, who got some gum or a mint?
My jewelry decorated, my diamonds shaped like a tent
I can't tell you what I spent, if I told ya, I'd have to kill ya
I've been smokin' hella hemp like a soldier, I'm off to kill
About my scrilla, I'm 'bout that world, 'bout that life
We sick like salmonella, crooked cops, crooked dice (UH!)
She bad as fuck and she nasty (And she nasty)
Poppin' pills like Nurse Jackie (Nurse Jackie)
Pussy opposite of flabby (Flabby)
Brazilian wax, not nappy
From the beginnin' and since day two, I've been winnin'
Fuck social media, in the hood, I'm trendin'
Better show up, that's what I tell a bitch (Tell a bitch)
Have her ho up, then I sell a bitch (Sell a bitch)

Workin' the trunk (Trunk)
Bitch got junk (Junk)
Hood nigga, always park my whip in the front (Whip in the front)
Ho ass niggas gettin' mad 'cause we stunt (Mad 'cause we stunt)
Runnin' through money, you could say what you want (Say what you want)

Fuck that cupcake, she just wanna dance (She wanna dance)
So exotic, she from the island
Dancin' erotic, sexy and violent
I ain't never seen shit like that
Make you wanna hit that cat (Hit it)
She ain't doin' new dances I ain't ever seen
But the way she do 'em is hella mean (Hella mean)
Hips look dangerous
She's sexy, but she's an angry bitch (Bitch)

Told her "Grab my arm, it's time to go (Go)

Big hips, big lips, good ass sex (Good ass sex)
Get her off the weed and the heem (And the heem)

Too much for the average player
All the weak ass niggas just pay her (Pay her)
Beggin', "Please don't embarrass me"
Down on one knee, "Please marry me" (Please marry me)
She wild as fuck, can't tell her nothin'
Freaky as hell when you fuckin'
