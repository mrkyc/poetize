(ProHoeZak Music)

I can call her a bitch (Bitch)
But I ain't gon' do it (Do it)
I could make her rich (Rich)
But I ain't gon' do it (Do it)
I can give her this dick (Dick)
But I ain't gon' do it (Bitch)
I'd give her all this shit (All this shit)
But I ain't gon' do it, I ain't gon' do it (Bitch)

I'll smack that ass, pull that hair
Hit that pussy anywhere
Don Julio or some Hennessy
She gon' do so many things for me
She don't need a shot, she already hot
She said, "Stick it in, and don't take it out"
I know this bitch is on a paper route
She want money from me, but don't say it now
You want a big tip? I can't do it
You tryna make me cum and drink my fluids
It's just what I need, a bitch like you
But I don't buy pussy, bitch, what you gon' do?
You might also like
I can call her a bitch (Bitch)
But I ain't gon' do it (Do it)
I could make her rich (Rich)
But I ain't gon' do it (Do it)
I can give her this dick (Give her this dick)
But I ain't gon' do it (Ain't gon' do it)
I'd give her all this shit (All this shit)
But I ain't gon' do it, I ain't gon' do it (Bitch)

I don't do no trickin', but I don't mind tippin'
I stay on my shit, I don't be slippin'
Fallin' asleep with my diamonds on
Wake up in the morning, find out she's gone
Don't know her name or where she went
That's some sucker shit, bitch, I'm a pimp
You can run them scams on all of them
When you see me cum, start swallowin'
Wanna make quick money? I'll tell you where to get it
Who taught her how to hustle? I'm the one who did it
You cash the bitch out, this shit is not the same
You gave that bitch a rack, I gave the bitch the game

I can call her a bitch (Bitch)
But I ain't gon' do it (Do it)
I could make her rich (Rich)
But I ain't gon' do it (Do it)
I can give her this dick (This dick)
But I ain't gon' do it (Don't do it)
I'd give her all this shit (All this shit)
But I ain't gon' do it, I ain't gon' do it (Bitch)
She's so bad, fine as hell
Got four kids but I can't tell
Grip that pole, wrap them thighs
Is it dancin' or exercise?
From the side, her booty shaped like the letter "P" (Letter "P")
Cakey like a motherfuckin' bakery, ain't no fee or salary (Uh)
I don't pay for coochie, baby, coochie pay for me (Me)
Let's reverse the game, take me on a shopping spree
She don't care if I'm tooken, that makes her want me even more
She shoot me yaper, she juggin', she said, "Players don't keep score"
Only mannish music on her playlist, she ghetto for surely
Like to smoke Runtz and Gary Payton and Zaza Pachuli' (Pachuli')

Bitch (Don't do it)
I'd give her all this shit (Don't do it)
I can give her this dick (This dick, don't do it)
I'd give her all this shit (All this shit)
