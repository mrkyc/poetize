I'm money motivated (I'm money motivated)
I'm all about my bread (I'm all about my bread)
All the ho ass niggas hate it (All the ho ass niggas hat it)
They wish that I was dead (They wish that I was dead)
I'm money motivated (I'm money motivated)
I'm all about my bread (I'm all about my bread)
All the ho ass niggas hate it (All the ho ass niggas hat it)
They wish that I was dead (They wish that I was dead)

Now I done did some good things and bad things with my life
But the good things outweigh the bad things
Flipped the coin and I rolled the fuckin' dice
Forgive me God for servin' dope fiends
I had a setback in my life, I was low in my ends
But guess what, God reached out and touched me again
The dope game up, start doin' what I do best
Beside hustlin' and sex, rappin' was the next
I knew I was it, I knew I can spit
More family, more fetti than sellin' them bricks, plus it's legit
I'm sharp like machete, my Chevy is heavy, watch me dip
If you stay ready, ain't gotta get ready, extended clip
Dig this, like a devil, anthropology
Seein' other niggas get money, inspires me
I'm not a hater, I'm a money motivator
If you can't beat em, join 'em, we can all get paper

You grew up on Too $hort
Sellin' dope on the corner, smokin' Newports
Tryna stack 'cause you dreamin'
OG's know exactly what I mean, we ain't seen 'em
It's a blessing if you still around
Ain't gotta sell coke, we still gettin' down
A real hustler always gets dough
And broke niggas don't always be broke
You better sit where you fit
You gettin' away, you get hit with a clip
Fuck around and get sent to the pen
So much time we never see him again
I'm out here on one
Been grindin' for years, I got a long run
And all the folks that gave up, fuck them
'Cause this is what I am
I'm money motivated (I'm money motivated)
I'm all about my bread (I'm all about my bread)
All the ho ass niggas hate it (All the ho ass niggas hat it)
They wish that I was dead (They wish that I was dead)
I'm money motivated (I'm money motivated)
I'm all about my bread (I'm all about my bread)
All the ho ass niggas hate it (All the ho ass niggas hat it)
They wish that I was dead (They wish that I was dead)

I ain't got no time for no haters
(I ain't got no time, mayne)
I'm just out here on the grind gettin' paper
(I'm out here gettin' paper, breh)
I ain't got no time for no haters
(I ain't got no time, mayne)
I'm just out here on the grind gettin' paper
(We out here gettin' paper, UH, BIATCH)

In and out of the traffic, commute
If it ain't about no loot, then it's minute
You can catch me in a hoodie or in a suit
I might be in a sedan or a coupe
I got a question to ask the government: why?
There's more youngsters in juvy than it is in junior high
I got a suggestion for my brethren: try
Work now, rest when you die, UH
The truth is amazin'
We all out here actin' like we crazy
Brainwashed tryna kill each other
Get together, we can make a million dollars
Would you kill a nigga 'cause you know you harder
Or get money like Short Dawg and 40 Water?
You wanna get in the streets and make the grip
Just look in the mirror and say this

I'm money motivated (I'm money motivated)
I'm all about my bread (I'm all about my bread)
All the ho ass niggas hate it (All the ho ass niggas hat it)
They wish that I was dead (They wish that I was dead)
I'm money motivated (I'm money motivated)
I'm all about my bread (I'm all about my bread)
All the ho ass niggas hate it (All the ho ass niggas hat it)
They wish that I was dead (They wish that I was dead)

I ain't got no time for no haters
