UH!
Spark one for the dark one, let's blast off
What kind of tree is that, huh? Strawberry cough
The contact alone will have you higher than Mt. Everest
Have you blowed as fuck, ignorin' your text messages
I'm at the intersection at the light smokin', inhalin' it (Uh-huh)
Gettin' right, I bet the car next to me they smellin' it (Uh-huh)
Honey tight, I like the way she lookin' and peepin'
(What else?) She act like she want some dick, wanna fuck with a heathen
I said "What's happenin', baby girl, what you got up for the evenin'?
Let your hair down 'cause sweetie it's the weekend
Come and get with a real one, 86 that square"
You say that every time you wanna fuck he ain't there (He ain't there)
You and your bitches can smoke with me and my niggas
And me and me my niggas can smoke with you and your bitches
We got trippy sticks, volcano, vaporizers and edibles
Smoked 448 grams of vegetable
BIATCH!

Your lungs have no protection
The whole club is the smokin' section
And when you come out West
Everybody smokes the best
'Cause ain't no stress, I'm never worried
I'm smokin' shit you ain't never heard of
So bitch pass it back
I know what you thinkin', don't ask me that
'Cause I'm talented, and I'm gifted
I smoke every day 'cause I'm addicted
Before I pass my weed to bitches
I pull my dick out and tell her "hit this"
Bitch, puff on these nuts
All you wanna do is just smoke the weed up
I'm 'bout to pull a all-nighter
And pass this bitch the lighter
Smoke it (BITCH!)

You a nanny (A nanny)
You need to wear a bra and some panties (Some panties)
You actin' like a little ho cakin' (Ho cakin')
Stop fuckin' up the rotation (The rotation) (BIATCH! UH!)
Hey y'all, this nigga's a bitch (BIATCH!)
Hoggin' the weed 'cause he ain't who she picked (MARK!)
This nigga sittin' here with a whole zip (Whole zip)
Stin'y motherfucker high blockin' and shit (High blockin' and shit)

Light that shit
You still smoke joints? I'm a OG, bitch
I seen you roll it up but I don't see no smoke
That NorCal kush, I hit it then choke
Mixed with a little hash
Who's smokin' that wax?
Where the weed at? I'm waitin' to hit it
Spark that shit and stop babysittin' (NIGGA!)
