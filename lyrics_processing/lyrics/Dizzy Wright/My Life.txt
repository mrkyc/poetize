My life, my word, my sight, my goals, my fight, my soul, I do my best to use me voice so right
I raise my hand, my past exist
Here I stand, I close my fist
It's not the cash that make me rich

Cold world, no peace, can't sleep
My whole world fell apart in a week
Shit it's hard in the streets when you trying to maintain
Man, I'm starvin' to eat, aparted and broke
Mama taught me how to follow my hope
Out of the hood, out of control
Only cause it was installed in me
If we could switch, y'all could see
Real life shit that bothers me
See, I'm trying dawg, in my own way, but I ain't y'all
Close ones wanna look down on me, make a nigga really not want to try at all
Stick to myself cause I'm who I trust
Are you kidding my nigga we livin' the same
We livin' in fear and we livin' in pain
A letter for birth, heaven on Earth
Tell them this my

My life, my word, my sight, my goals, my fight, my soul, I do my best to use me voice so right
I raise my hand, my past exist
Here I stand, I close my fist
It's not the cash that make me rich
You might also like
One of my brodees put me up on game
Twisted the medical, passed me the flame
I elevated without no hesitation
My mind was just racin', I couldn't complain
My body was lifted
The hustle, I rather be high than be gettin' in trouble
Runnin' the streets, I ain't fuckin' with niggas that's rowdy for nothin'
I'm proud to be me, but I don't want to struggle

We workin' to live, we livin' to die
It's hurting my ribs
I'm talkin' about searchin' for love
Replacin' my hurt, I deserve to be rich
These niggas is feelin' me now, but what about how I got to this place
I'm talkin' about homeless and hungry
I was livin' in shelters, travelin' states
My momma was a hard worker
If I ain't learn nothin', that's all I know
Shortcuts don't have real outcomes
So in the long run you gon' see my growth
From a boy to a man
Fans, I have a voice and a plan
Don't be blinded by the mainstream scams
Niggas talk lies, and I don't wanna be the one to die when I'm trying to make the weak understand
Here I am
My life, my word, my sight, my goals, my fight, my soul, I do my best to use me voice so right
I raise my hand, my past exist
Here I stand, I close my fist
It's not the cash that make me rich

I see how this shit finna pan out
Get a little dough, everybody got they hand out
Stand out, cause I'm all business
Talk wicked, everybody want in, creatin' a false image
False motives, niggas spittin' all gimmicks
Your music full of lies and that's what you call winnin'
Didn't get in the race cause I wanted to jog in and
Now my job has evolved I'm praying that y'all get it
To my men and my women
My infamous children, this may not be your concern
But what if we had no shoes, no clothes, no teachers to teach us to learn
We earn, survivin' in life
Becomin' a man with no father in sight
Tryin' my hardest not becomin' one of these niggas that's slippin' through money and pussy
Lord, I thank you
Blessed of recording angels
Happiness from being born, thankful
Glorified, someone easily became a target
But I swear I'm only tryin' to save you
This is my life, my word, my sight, my voice, my light
I strive, to be a motivator to anybody with fight
Prepare to compare, but it's one Dizzy Wright
