"And you drinking...uhhh"
"What you drinking?"
"Champagne"
"Champagne, Champagne Cocktail?"
He's been hot for decades!

On beat like the drum kick
5 star chick in my suite, having fun with it
Back it up and dump it when I'm pumping girl, come on wit it
Close range thumping, thump busting, long gun, get it?
On it like I want it, yeah I fell before
That was 2FL, now that story I don't tell no more
I don't do it like them, I do it like me
Had the whole word hyphy "yadadada like Keak"
Peeking when I'm squeaking in the side
By the swag and the bag, made me never know...doubt it
Headliner's tax, line around the corner crowd
And you like this club? I'll buy them, see us about it
Don't gotta get down to my music
And I can show you way better, take me through
Girlie wake at A.M. at the 1 O'clock, wanna snooze
Lose if you confused, when you fall in the door, you choose

I see you in the club, attacked by all these scrubs
They tryna buy you shots, they tryna show you love
Baby, let me switch your format, format, format
Your format, baby, let me switch your format

No PC, I'm a Mac
Rented red apples, no oranges, and the slim backs
Go giddy on a britty, take take that
Spent about an hour, took you years just to make that
Let me show you how I rock baby, off top
Fuck just looking, window shopping, trying on, and copping
A lot of life, it's your life, baby, look alive
We don't do tax when the price is the right size
I'm being paid for my work, top dollar
Write publishing, I write these checks for the rest of my life
My kids' kids gone be straight, and they kids', kids', kids', kids' gon be looking great
I'm tryna put you on this hype
Meth off track, backtrack, rack making right
Sky the limits, not afraid of heights
In my palms, itching for the scratch like a spider bite

I see you in the club, attacked by all these scrubs
They tryna buy you shots, they tryna show you love
Baby, let me switch your format, format, format
Your format, baby, let me switch your format

Format switching, hit her with the whoopty whup
Goin for the dough and you knowin I'll never stop
Never say never? Whatever nigga, never would
I'ma leave the spot when Task hit, but never shake the hood
It's good, it's all of us sitting, gripping wood
Rolling in the back, piss sack, twist a pack of woods
Doing what I wanna like I should, suckas what they could
With them 3rd legs on the head of the bigfoot
You know what that mean, rocking 13
I'ma make you feel good and hurry 'fore the skirt clean
Taking trips outerspace on these earthlings
See what I see, you all in the door from the turf rings
Don't gotta be doubting my music
And a nigga show you way better than taking you? Prove it
Only waking game like an alarm clock when you're snoozing
Lose if you confused, when you fall in the door, you choose
I see you in the club, attacked by all these scrubs
They tryna buy you shots, they tryna show you love
Baby, let me switch your format, format, format
Your format, baby, let me switch your format
