Like when you came home the other day
We made love all night
But there was something that i had to say
I was thinking if
We just walked down the walkway
If i asked your hand
I wonder what would the people say
It'd be something for the non-believers in the front
To see
That never saw a girl on bended knee
So if you're not afraid to love
If you're not afraid to give
If you're not afraid of us
Let me hear you say i will
If you're not afraid of love
If you're not afraid to give
If you're not afraid of us
Let me hear you say i will
Let me hear you say i will
And we got all these problems
But i love the way we solve them
And i know i'm a handful
But i'm working, working
And baby, you're so beautiful
The way you make me pay
Why should we stand on ceremony
Let's flip it
Do it our own way
You might also likeIt'd be something for the non-believers in the front
To see
That never saw a girl on bended knee
So if you're not afraid to love
And if you're not afraid to give
If you're not afraid of us
Let me hear you say i will
If you're not afraid of love
If you're not afraid to give
If you're not afraid of us
Let me hear you say i will
Let me hear you say i will
Your white tux
And my black dress
When you say yes
It'd be too much for the week at heart
Your daddy crying in the front row
Your mama laughing in the back row....
Oh...f you're not afraid of love
If you're not afraid to give
If you're not afraid of us
Let me hear you say i will
If you're not afraid of love
If you're not afraid to give
If you're not afraid of us
Let me hear you say i will
Let me hear you say i will
