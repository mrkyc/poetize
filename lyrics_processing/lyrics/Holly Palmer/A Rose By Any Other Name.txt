There's beauty in everything
It all depends on just how hard you?re looking
That gets you what life brings
So I really don't mind waiting
Though you?re half a world away
It's remembering your silly smile
That gets me through the day
I read fifteen chapters of a
Real slow book today
And I noticed for a short time
That I forgot you'd gone away
Through two hole pots of coffee
I washed the dishes and I cleaned the shelves
Then I thought I heard you tell me
To stop feeling sorry for myself
So some, they, they talk of cease fire
Or heading for higher ground
Like a frog that jumps to water lilies
You?re the safest thing I've found
And if you weren't so beautiful
I would love you just the same
You'd be a rose by any other name
You might also likeI know I could have had a life of sandy beaches
Champagne and top shelf wine
But 'cos life doesn't last forever
I chose you and got it right the first time
We'll make hay while the sun shines
And love 'til the evening fades
And that beats riches
It's a better life we've made, so while
So some, they, they talk of cease fire
Or heading for higher ground
Like a frog that jumps to water lilies
You?re the safest thing I've found
And if you weren't so beautiful
I'd love you just the same
You'd be a rose by any other name
So when you get home, boy, look out
I'll show you just what loves all about
There'll be candles and wine
I'll pull down the blind and I'll tell
All our friends that we're out
So some, they, they talk of cease fire
Or heading for higher ground
Like a frog that jumps to water lilies
You?re the safest thing I've found
And if you weren't so beautiful
I'd love you just the same
