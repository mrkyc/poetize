I'll leave you behind
It's not the first time
That we've been through this
It happens every time
You hear the sound of my name at the top of their lungs
And this dumb game you play isn't fooling anyone
And now I wanna know
Are you catching my drift yet?
Oh, are you catching my drift yet?
You seem to be good at taking control
Are you catching my drift yet?

Now that we have said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you can't stand a thing I do?
And don't lie cause we know that you want too
Now I can't seem to comprehend
How the things that you're saying is not what you meant at all
Because last time I checked
These so called "friends"
Were your "friends 'til the very end"

And now I know, that I have made big plans
And I have said big things that I have pulled out of my head
That these sins are kept a lot
And have been kept it all
Now a handful is all that's left
You might also likeCan you just look at how things were, and how they are right now, and please tell me that I am right
Just tell me why it's so hard for you to be wrong for once in your life

Now that we have said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you can't stand a thing I do?
And don't lie cause we know that you want too
Now I can't seem to comprehend
How the things that you're saying is not what you meant at all
Because last time I checked
These so called "friends"
Were your "friends 'til the very end"

Now that we have said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you can't stand a thing I do?
And don't lie cause we know that you want too
