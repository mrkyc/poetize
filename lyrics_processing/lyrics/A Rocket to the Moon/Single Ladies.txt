I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip but now you wanna trip
'Cause another girl noticed me
I'm up on her, she's up on me
Don't pay her any attention
I cried my tears for three good years
You can't be mad at me
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that she want it
And if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
You got gloss on your lips, a girl on my hips
Tighter than your Dereon jeans
Acting up, a drink in my cup
I couldn't care less what you think
You might also likeI need no permission, did I mention?
Don't pay her any attention
You had your turn but now you gotta learn
What it really feels like to miss me
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad now you see that she want it
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Put a ring on it
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
And if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that she want it
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda
And if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that she want it
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Put a ring on it
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh
