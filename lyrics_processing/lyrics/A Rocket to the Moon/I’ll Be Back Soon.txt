To not wake me up
So that you can leave
And I can't make you stay
Your pictures are hanging on the wall
I'm waiting for them to fall
I'm watching the world
Fall to pieces on the floor
And there's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can do
But to build it up
And watch it fall again
Again..
I'll say farewell to the world behind
As I drive into the night
I'll make all this up to you
And promise I'll be back soon
I'm writing this whole thing down
To show you that this is the truth
I can't keep a secret
I'll be alright
I won't be home tonight
I'm not waiting for you
To be there when I
Get back from this long ride
There's so much I want to say
But you won't listen
You never listen
To me..
To me..

And promise I'll be back soon
I'm writing this whole thing down
To show you that this is the truth
I can't keep a secret
I'll be alright
I won't be home tonight
I saw everything there's to see
I didn't see you and me
And since that this night is through
I just want to be with you
She's waited for so long
So how can this be wrong
I'll say farewell to the world behind
As I drive into the night
I'll make all this up to you
And promise I'll be back soon
I'm writing this whole thing down
To show you that this is the truth
I can't keep a secret
I'll be alright
I won't be home tonight
So much I want to say 
To not wake me up 
So you can leave And I can't make you stay
You never lis
