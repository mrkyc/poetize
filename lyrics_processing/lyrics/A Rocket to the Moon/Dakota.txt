She knows exactly what to do, whenever I'm alone with her
I can barely make a move by the time she opens up her eyes
She sings to me at night
She's singing
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba ba da ba ba

I know that she barely knows me, and I'm fake in love with her
It's like I'm singing karaoke, and I forgot the second verse
But I can make up my own words

Oh Dakota, I know our love is new
I barely know you, I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do that make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?

She's got a little bit of money and a little bit of this and it's all she needs to live
I've got a little bit of love and a little bit of that and it's all I have to give
But this time, I'll try not to show that I am not letting go

Oh Dakota, I know our love is new
I barely know you, I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do that make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?

I'll show you I'll show you
And you'll know, and you'll know I'm not letting go
I'll show you I'll show you
And you'll know, and you'll know I'm not letting go
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba ba da ba ba

Oh Dakota, I know our love is new
I barely know you, I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do that make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?
Oh Dakota, I know our love is new
I barely know you, I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do that make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?
