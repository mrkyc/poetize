She never knows when it's raining
She only knows when it's cold
She's always saying how she hates it, how
Her story sounds so old
She packed her clothes in her suitcase
Then put that case in her car
She says she's gotta get so far gone, oh, so far gone
And she don't even care how far

Where did you go when you knew you didn't know me?
And you never wanted to figure me out
I didn't know, I never even saw it coming
I'll wait all my life

So come back over to the East Coast, baby
We'll figure out a way to make this work
My chest is feeling empty, always
You're its only cure
You know that I try so hard, I try so hard
And nothing seems to ever work
It's like I'm running and I cannot stop, I cannot stop
Oh, you just love to make this hurt
You might also like
Where did you go when you knew you didn't know me?
And you never wanted to figure me out
I didn't know, I never even saw it comin'
I'll wait all my life, if you give me some time

She's all alone now
She can't find her own way out
We're eyeing the sundown
And she's caught up in her new West Coast town
She's all alone
Finding her own way out
California, let me down
She traded me for living the good life
Staying up all night
Darling, can you hear me now?

Where did you go when you knew you didn't know me?
And you never wanted to figure me out
I didn't know, I never even saw it coming
I'll wait all my life..

Where did you go?
I didn't know
I didn't know, I never even saw it coming
I'll wait all my life if you give me some time
(Give me, give me, give me, give me some time)
(Give me, give me, give me, give me some time)
If you give me some time
(Give me, give me, give me, give me some time)
