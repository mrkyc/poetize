Annabelle, you think you're so damn special
But there's a million other girls like you
Thirty minutes and you say we're official
But I have got some news for you

I need a girl, not a body with a complex
I got a heart and you've got your lipstick
Fine as hell but I think I might as well drop Annabelle

You're staying up just to dance alone (woah)
I'm dressing down cause I'm tired and I wanna go home
You look the part but looks don't tell the truth, woah-oh
Well baby you're pretty but I'm pretty sure I'm over you

You can't even hold a normal conversation
But you can tell your friends I ruined your life
Whatever helps your perfect reputation
Cause I'm not losing sleep tonight

I met a girl and she's more than a pretty face
Six drinks and she still remembers my name
Fine as hell but I think I might as well drop Annabelle (Annabelle)
You might also like
You're staying up just to dance alone (woah)
I'm dressing down cause I'm tired and I wanna go home
You look the part but looks don't tell the truth, woah-oh
Well baby you're pretty but I'm pretty sure I'm over you

Turn around
Turn around and walk away
I want out
I can't take another day
Even though she moves so well
I don't need a girl like Annabelle

You're staying up just to dance alone (woah)
I'm dressing down cause I'm tired and I wanna go home
You look the part but looks don't tell the truth, woah-oh
Well baby you're pretty but I'm pretty sure I'm over you
You're staying up just to dance alone (woah)
I'm dressing down cause I'm tired and I wanna go home
You look the part but looks don't tell the truth, woah-oh
Well baby you're pretty but I'm pretty sure I'm over you
