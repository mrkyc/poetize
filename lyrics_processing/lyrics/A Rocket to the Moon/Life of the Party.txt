They're on you like a tattoo
They're watching every move that you make
Your blue eyes were white lies
I thought you were mine for the taking
But you punched my lights out

Now you're free to be the lonely life of the party
And girl you'll see
But let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

Never should have told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around and threw me down
And now I can't get up
You'll be sorry, just you wait and see
But let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

You puzzle like a jigsaw
You love me now we don't fit together
I used up my last straw
I thought I would drink you forever
But now you're my last call
You might also like
Now you're free to be the lonely life of the party
And girl you'll see
But let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

Never should have told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around and threw me down
And now I can't get up
You'll be sorry, just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

I know why you set the trap
I know why you dress in black
Flies in your web tonight?
I know why you beat the wrap?
Someday you'll be crawling back
Crawling, you'll be crawling back to me

I never should have told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around and threw me down
And now I can't get up
You'll be sorry, just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight
I never should have told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around and threw me down
And now I can't get up
You'll be sorry, just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me
I never should have told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around and threw me down
And now I can't get up
You'll be sorry, just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight
