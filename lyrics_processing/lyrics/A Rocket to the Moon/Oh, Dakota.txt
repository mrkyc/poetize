Whenever I'm alone with her
I can barely make a move
By the time she opens up her eyes
She sings to me at night
She's singing
(Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba da ba da)
(Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba da ba da)
I know that she barely knows me
And I'm fake in love with her
It's like I'm singing karaoke
And I forgot the second verse
But I can make up my own words
Oh, Dakota
I know our love is new
I barely know ya
I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do
That made me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?
She's got a little bit of money
And a little bit of this
And it's all she needs to live
I got a little bit of love
And a little bit of that
And it's all I have to give
But this time I'll try not to show
That I am not letting go
Oh, Dakota
I know our love is new
I barely know ya
I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do
That make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?
I'll show ya, I'll show ya
And you'll know, and you'll know
I'm not letting go
I'll show ya, I'll show ya
And you'll know, and you'll know
I'm not letting go
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba da ba da
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba da ba da
Oh, Dakota
I know our love is new
I barely know ya
I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do
That make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?
Oh, Dakota
I know our love is new
I barely know ya
I've fallen over you
It's the way you do the things you do
That make me fall in love with you
Dakota, are you in love with me too?
'Cause I'm in love with you
