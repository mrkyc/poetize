I'm not here anymore
And I'm not scared anymore
The way you walked away
I could tell you weren't afraid
To do the things you had to do
Even though I meant so much to you
But darling where you goin'?
It's so cold outside
I know that I can't be concerned
But you're still in my life
(But you're still in my life)
CHORUS:
When I am miles away
Will you still check on me?
Tell me things will be alright
Just tell me we will be
Together someday
It's in the dreams I have
I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
(You'll be my silhouette.)
Just take my hand and well
Never let go because
If we're together now
We'll be together then
Step back and see me walk away
And watch me run right back
I'll show you how to love again
This is the best idea I've had
(This is the best idea I've had.)

I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
CHORUS
When I am miles away
Will you still check on me?
Tell me things will be alright
Just tell me we will be
Together someday
It's in the dreams I have
I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
(You'll be my silhouette.)
When I am miles away
Will you still check on me?
Tell me things will be alright
Just tell me we will be
Together someday
It's in the dreams I have
I'll be your sunset
If you'll be my silhouette
