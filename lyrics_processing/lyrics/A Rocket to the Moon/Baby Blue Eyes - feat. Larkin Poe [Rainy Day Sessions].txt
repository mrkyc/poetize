The way she moves, I never doubt her
When she talks, she somehow creeps into my dreams
She's a doll, a catch, a winner
I'm in love and no beginner;
Could ever grasp or understand just what she means
Baby, baby blue eyes
Stay with me by my side;
'Til the mornin', through the night
Well baby
Stand here, holdin' my sides
Close your baby blue eyes;
Every moment feels right
And I may feel like a fool
But I'm the only one, dancin' with you
Oh...
I drive her home when she can't stand
I like to think I'm a better man
For not lettin' her do what she's been, known to do
She wears heels and she always falls
Don't let her think she's a know-it-all
But whatever she does wrong, it seems so right
My eyes don't believe her
But my heart, swears by her
You might also likeBaby, baby blue eyes
Stay with me by my side;
'Til the mornin', through the night. (can't get you out of my mind)
Well baby
Stand here, holdin' my sides
Close your baby blue eyes;
Every moment feels right
And I may feel like a fool
But I'm the only one, dancin' with you
Oh...
Can't get you out of mind
I swear, I've been there
I swear, I've done that
I'll do whatever it takes, to see those
Baby, baby blue eyes
Stay with me by my side;
'Til the mornin', through the night. (can't get you out of my mind)
Baby, stand here, holdin' my sides
Close your baby blue eyes;
Every moment feels right
And I may feel like a fool
But I'm the only one, dancin' with those
Baby, baby blue eyes
Stay with me by my side;
'Til the mornin', through the night. (can't get you out of my mind)
Baby, stand here, holdin' my sides
I'm closin' your baby blue eyes;
Every moment feels right. (every moment feels right)
My eyes are no good- blind without her
The way she moves, I never doubt her
