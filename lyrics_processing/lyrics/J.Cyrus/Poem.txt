I was like, damn
And it was like, two o'clock in the am
And she didn't have no plans and
I didn't have no plans
Check it out:
Told 'em we can hit the spot and we can prolly kick it
Maybe take a couple shots until the molly kick in
Honestly we started making out and then the molly hit
And now we talking bodies at the party while the lobby spinning
Her eyes turned into oceans
Her lips turned into potion
Her skin turned into lotion
And he still turned in the motions
Soak it up
Listen girl it's been a minute since I opened up
But it don't even take a minute just to notice us
Living in the moment got me hoping that you wanna cut
Girl it ain't the motive but I'm hoping it's coming up

'member the night?
When you and I made love in clouds
Made the rain come up and down
And rolled away with that ocean, now
You might also like'member the night?
When we arrived in outer space
Left the world without a trace
Made the love that you wanna make

Damn... she just got a text from her man
And she didn't give a damn, so
I didn't give a damn
Here we go:
Told him she should hit him back and tell him not to worry
Finally found a better man who loves her talking dirty
Actually just send him an emoji like:
"I'm sorry homie, on another planet with a man on a safari, homie"
Hey baby let's cruise
To a place with ocean views
Relation's overdue
When I do a couple things you want me to
Hello, hi
So let us, just you and I
I put that look in your eyes
We can go up and away for a couple of days if you like to make love in the sky
'member the night?
When you and I made love in clouds
Made the rain come up and down
And rolled away with that ocean, now
'member the night?
When we arrived in outer space
Left the world without a trace
