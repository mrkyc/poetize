Girl, I remember back when I would text with no reply
Said that you were busy but I knew that was a lie
Pretended that you miss me and want me by your side
But you forgot to mention that you met another guy
So here I sit alone
Living through these pictures on my phone
Downing half a fifth of whiskey just to get me in the zone
Got me kicking it with women that I never met before
Tryna' get these images of him and you to go, yeah
And now I'm losing focus on my health
All because your love was bogus and you focused on yourself
Had me trying flying, driving, just to show you I was giving
While you kept me good and hidden to protect your perfect image
Girl, I wasn't worth a shit to you
Look at all I did for you
No, I wasn't rich, but I would give what I could give to you
Loved you unconditional
Texted me "I miss you too"
'Cause you didn't even care enough to just admit that it was through

I bet you when the nights get cold
And the lights go dark
And you're sitting there all alone
You gon' regret it
You gon' regret it
I bet you when those tears start falling
And you realize that
We could've had forever
You gon' regret it
I bet you'll regret it
You might also like
And girl, I promise it's okay
I got it, I ain't even worried 'bout it
I've been so hurt on my grind that you were not even a topic
I just do it, I get it
I finally got a vision
Taking trips to different cities
Making moves - I'm out here living
And I'm so gone, all on my own
I'm flying back and forth to Cali 'till I call it my home
I hope you see me at the top and feel like "Damn, I was wrong"
I'm out here working on myself and all you are is a song

I bet you when the nights get cold
And the lights go dark
And you're sitting there all alone
You gon' regret, gon' regret
Gon' regret, gon' regret
Gon' regret, gon' regret it
Gon' regret, gon' regret, gon' regret it
Gon' regret, gon' regret
Gon' regret, gon' regret
Gon' regret, gon' regret
Gon' regret, gon' regret
You gon' regret it
I bet you when those tears start falling
And you realize that
We could've had forever
You gon' regret it
I bet you'll regret it
Let 'em know
I bet you gon' hear this
And know I'm talking 'bout you (Know I'm talking 'bout you)
I ain't ever been the type to run my mouth about a woman (About a woman)
But things change, it all change, it all change (It all change)
How you steal a heart (How you do it)
And don't have one for me to steal
How you close your eyes (How you)
So you can see how I feel
Hope you

But really, girl, I wish you the best
I hope you find what I was never meant to be in the next
So you can tell him all about how much you hated your ex
Until you start to hate him too and rip his heart out his chest, ha
But honestly, I cherish what you've given me
Gained a lot of knowledge off of everything you did to me
Learned what love is not so I can find out what it is to me
