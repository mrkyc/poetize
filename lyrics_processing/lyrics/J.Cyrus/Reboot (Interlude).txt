Eyes closed
Tears fall
Raindrops from the sky
And I can tell you're scared

I got a couple of deals in my inbox
And they get mad when my name drops
I never came to brag
I brought a pen and a pad
And I'm a learn the game till my brain stops
And I'm still keeping it cool-o
Cuz I came up acting a fool-o
Let me get a cup mixed with that Nuvo
Run through a gallon of liquor till I'm sumo
Get it?
They don't really wanna mess with it
Tell your buddy I'm a guard
I roll with no limits
No gimmicks
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a menace
Get served on a green new love like it's tennis
I left for a minute to watch all these gimmes get rich off of copying
And now I'm back in it to show I can kill anything I've been dropping
And stop
I want that money that get you that plane and a yacht
Gimme a couple of mil with a lack of a deal
On a label so I can get dropped
Travel the country for money
I'm hungry to pay off this mountain of debt that I got
Or I could keep living broke
'Til I hang from a rope
After taking a couple of shots, ha
You might also likeBut let's get real though
I ain't nothing but a kid with a ill flow
Living in a city full of boots with a steel toe
Famous on an app full of whacks, but I kill those
And that's no problem
Tell 'em kids, coming like a rip in a condom
No "plan B", drip, drip, sorry mama
I'm who to blame, I'm insane, Flow-bama

Eyes closed
Tears fall
Raindrops from the sky
And I can tell you're scared
But you know that my eyes closed
No fear
Keep going 'til I say something
Uh, 'til I feel something
Uh, 'til you realize

Reboot
Now listen up, real good, when I put it down
Still the same dude
Spitting  from the underground
Pick at a ticket
Let's take a right
I don't got a lay on a track to get by
No bullets cuz
Killing dead bodies cuz I'd
Rather just give you the realest
And kill it easily
The whip in the lyrics
I got a miracle spirit
