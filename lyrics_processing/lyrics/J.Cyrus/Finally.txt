But now you never cross my mind
It doesn't matter if I'm lonely
I'll just find a way to pass the time
I wanna let you know I'm moving on
And tell you you should move on too
Either way I don't care 'bout
Anything that you might do
Dear diary, it's so inspiring
I finally got a fucking grip on what's inside of me
Finally, I never think about that bitch who lied to me
Except for when I need to write a song and live for irony
But fuck it, I'm grown, I'm finally moving on
And I just got a puppy so my problems are all gone
You might catch me at a party talkin' to a couple broads
And shit, I might even bring 'em to my house
And if it feels consensual I kiss 'em on the mouth
Anything to make me feel like you do not exist
I just pop a fucking Paxal and forget about a bitch
I might pull up to a bar, order water, take a sip
And buy drinks for all your friends to let 'em know I'm still the shit
Baby I might even hook up with the friends you used to diss
Remember that girl Rachel, like you would always come home and fucking whine and complain about like you hated her?
We made out
You might also likeI used to think about you all day
But now you never cross my mind
It doesn't matter if I'm lonely
I'll just find a way to pass the time
I wanna let you know I'm moving on
And tell you you should move on too
Either way I don't care 'bout
Anything that you might do
Look, I hope you're doing well, fuck it, no I don't
I hope you're just okay, and even kinda broke
I hope you see my pics and get a little mad
I never told you but I really hate your fucking dad
But that's enough of that, cause I don't even care
I finally got that type of love in me that I can share
Guess I should give you credit, for fucking up my head
Cause now I'll never let a girl like you mess up again
Listen up closely baby, you wasn't worth my time
Driving me so damn crazy, finally I feel fine
Listen up closely baby, you wasn't worth my time
Driving me so damn crazy, finally I feel fine
I used to think about you all day
But now you never cross my mind
It doesn't matter if I'm lonely
I'll just find a way to pass the time
I wanna let you know I'm moving on
And tell you you should move on too
Either way I don't care 'bout
Anything that you might do
Okay so, for whatever reason you came up on my Instagram feed
The other day and I was like "Damn, I don't even follow her. What is this?"
But I noticed you were in a bikini and you were looking good as fuck
And I was like "Dude, she still has great tits."
I'm sorry if you're offended by this track but like, at the end of the day
I just want you to know, you still have a great pair of tits
Also It'd be really cool if you could give me Rachel's number
