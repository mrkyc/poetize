I won't take all that they hand me down
And make out a smile, though I wear a frown
'Cause I'm not gonna take it all lying down
'Cause once I get started, I go to town

'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

And I don't want to walk about like everybody else
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

But darling, you know that I love you true
Do anything that you want me to
Confess all my sins like you want me to
There's one thing that I will say to you

I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
You might also like
And I don't want to walk about like everybody else
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else

If you all want me to settle down
Slow up and stop all my running 'round
Do everything like you want me to
There's one thing that I will say to you

I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

And I don't want to walk about like everybody else
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else
And I don't want to stay confined like everybody else
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
Like everybody else (Like everybody else)
Like everybody else (Like everybody else)
Like everybody else (Like everybody else)
