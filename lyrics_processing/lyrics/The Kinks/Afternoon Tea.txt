Tea time won't be the same without my Donna
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna
I think about that small cafe
That's where we used to meet each day
And then we used to sit a while
And drink our afternoon tea

I'll take afternoon tea (Afternoon tea)
If you take it with me (Afternoon tea)
You take as long as you like
'Cause I like you, girl

I take sugar with tea (Afternoon tea)
You take milk if you please (Afternoon tea)
Like you talking to me
Because you ease my mind

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (Afternoon tea)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (Afternoon tea)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (Afternoon tea)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (Afternoon tea)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You might also like
Tea time still ain't the same without my Donna
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna
I went to our cafe one day
They said that Donna walked away
You'd think at least she might have stayed
To drink her afternoon tea

I'll take afternoon tea (Afternoon tea)
If you take it with me (Afternoon tea)
You take as long as you like
'Cause I like you, girl

I'd take afternoon tea (Afternoon tea)
Every day of the week (Afternoon tea)
Please come along if you like
Because I like you, girl

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (Afternoon tea)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (Afternoon tea)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (Afternoon tea)
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (Afternoon tea)
