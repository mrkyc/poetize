Walter, remember when the world was young
And all the girls knew Walter's name?
Walter, isn't it a shame the way
Our little world has changed?
Do you remember, Walter
Playing cricket in the thunder and the rain?
Do you remember, Walter
Smoking cigarettes behind your garden gate?
Yes, Walter was my mate
But Walter, my old friend, where are you now?

Walter's name, Walter
Isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?
Do you remember, Walter
How we said we'd fight the world so we'd be free?
We'd save up all our money
And we'd buy a boat and sail away to sea
But it was not to be
I knew you then, but do I know you now?

Walter, you are just an echo of a world
I knew so long ago
Walter, if you saw me now
You wouldn't even know my name
I bet you're fat and married
And you're always home in bed by half-past eight
And if I talked about the old times
You'd get bored and you'd have nothing more to say
You might also like
Yes, people often change
