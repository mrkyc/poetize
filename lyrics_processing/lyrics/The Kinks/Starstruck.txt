Baby, you don't know what you're saying
Because you're a victim of bright city lights
And your mind is not right
You think the world's at your feet

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck
You're taken in by the lights (You know that you're starstruck baby, starstruck)
You think you'll never look back (You know that you're starstruck baby, starstruck, you know that you're...)
You know you're starstruck on me

Baby, you're running around like you're crazy
You go to a party and dance through the night
And you'll drink 'til you're tight
And then you're out on your feet

'Cause you're starstruck, baby, starstruck
You're taken in by the lights (You know that you're starstruck baby, starstruck)
You think you'll never look back (You know that you're starstruck baby, starstruck, you know that you're...)
You know you're starstruck on me

Ba-ba-ra, ba-ba-ba-ra-ra-ra
Ba-pa-ba-ra, ba-pa-ba-ra-ra (Yeah!)
Ba-pa-ba-ra, ba-pa-ba-ra-ra-ra
Ba-pa-ba-ra, ba-pa-ba-ra-ra-ra

Baby, watch out or else you'll be ruined
'Cause once you're addicted to wine and champagne
It's gonna drive you insane
Because the world's not so tame

And you're starstruck, baby, starstruck
You're taken in by the lights (You know that you're starstruck baby, starstruck)
You think you'll never look back (You know that you're starstruck baby, starstruck, you know that you're...)
Ooh, starstruck on me

Don't you know that you are (Starstruck on me)
And you always will be (Starstruck on me)
Ooh, yeah (Starstruck on me)
Starstruck on me
La-ah, la-la
