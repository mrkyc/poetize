Just a quiet city sport
With a wife and little kids to support
So immaculately dressed when he walks
Like a soldier on parade

He's a tin soldier man
Living in a little tin wonderland
Very happy little tin soldier man
When you set him on your knee

Every day you see his army march down the street
Changing guards at the high road
Bap-bap-baom
Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-baom
He's a tin soldier man

Wickie wa-waddle doo
And he's got a little tin lady too
Just to put a little shine on his shoes
And keep his uniform tidy
