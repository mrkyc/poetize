Yeah I'm hot
Yeah I'm hot
Yeah I'm hot
Tsssss...

Yeah I'm hot like the devil's pitchfork
I burn they ass, folks stay low-key
I'm smokin' dolo behind the window
My kinfolks, they all high
Pitchforks up in the sky
Don't be surprised if we roll by
We might come through and set up shop
Knockin' out the competition
Showin' 'em all what they been missin'
Here to get alotta cake and cornbread plus that green spinach
Winnin' while I'm sinnin', got demons on my fuckin' mind
I'm hopin' to make it another month on this hustle grind
You don't wanna see me, these niggas they wanna be me
Plus they hoes wanna G me, it's yo boy Mac Montese
These suckers throwin' pebbles, we spittin' heavy metal
Yeah that hot shit, top notch shit, you can't do it no better
 2x
We hotter than the devil
You niggas ain't our level
You can't reach us with a shovel
Cause we always  rebels
While these suckers throwin' pebbles
We spittin' heavy metal
Yeah that hot shit, top notch shit
You can't do it no better

Strike 'em with da fangs of the Lycan, light 'em with da hammer
Thick mamma jamma , levity with Montana
Purple mixed with Fanta got me hyped up in the back of the Phantom
Make you shit your pampers when I hit you with a lethal sample
Uppercut like Evander, Lord is walkin' with a panther
Quickly blowin' out yo candle, knock you out yo fuckin' sandals
Slice you like a samurai, test your fuckin' stamina
Fuck you up on camera, I'm Tommy Lee, you Pamela
Soze - I'm the damager, you deal with death, I'll manage ya
Amazon stun gun, coke-a-ton in the rough
Huff and puff and hit the dust, leavin' your body somewhere in the rust
Catch a headrush, lead busts and spill a fags guts
 2x

Yeah I'm hated by you hoes but I'm loved in my city
All the critics kiss my ass and all the shit that came with it
Make your heart stop, brain pop, explosion from the fucking Glock
Ratta-tatta-tatta on your ass till your body drop
Hotter than the flames of hell, burn ya like the damn son
Leave the barrel smokin' (do you really wanna get ya sum?)
Peace is for pussy, let me walk ya to the light
Where them serpents dwell in hell and claimin' dogs afterlife
Slit yo finger with a razor, write yo name with the blood
Say "I pray to Lucifer" and join the satanism club
I'm tired of you niggas who sayin' you're real, I'm pissing on your grave spot
24/7 youre hatin' the mack and this is why you bitches hot
