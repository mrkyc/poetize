When we get the clappin'

Infamous, trick I'm the deadliest rapper to ever spit this rapid-fire ass flow
You really don't want to be pissing me off, I will wait till you sleep and cut your fuckin' throat
Look up the Scarecrow in your dictionary and you will see I'm defined of the pain
I'm taking a needle and fill it with acid and stick it into your damn jugular vein
I promise you bitch, you don't want to get rough cause matter of fact trick I am calling your bluff
Fuck what you think, I will blast out your thoughts, I will grind up your bones and I snort 'em like dust
I sit back and observe you slimy sissy ass niggas with Slytherin gangs
I can't figure out for the life of me, Google say you whack ass niggas on contract mane
I'm back in the day when life was a hell and I'm here to say "all of you pussies damn straight"
When Lucifer let me up out the hell gates he told me "bring me back a damn MC steak"
I'm cookin' up fresh fuckin' wussies in a fraction of time on my fuckin' Foreman Grill
You talk some shit, I wash your fuckin' mouth out with some massengill
I ram this long barrel .44 mag up yo ass
But I'll just put it to yo dome cuz you will probably like that fag
Infamous cocaine assassin, weak niggas I blast 'em up outta the universe
Bitch you better disperse 'fore I spill your brains in your purse

You won't see tomorrow, my killers too crunk and hostile
Don't need the hollow, smack a bottle cross his avocado
Follow the code and swallow, yo grindin' die like Pablo
Game is the boss , you just a (?) for real a bitch I know
Hey pic this like Picasso, knock niggas out like Drago
Business is business, it's the model, this life is a lotto
You doin' me like Rocko, bitin' a G, you borrow
The style from me so we burnin' up yo (?) logo
Panic caught off in morrow, family heart full of sorrow
Empty the cartridge in yo (?) I'm heartless (?)
Shit from hater's informal, smarter than you retardos
Lyrical Leonardo, dressed in all-black like I'm Zorro
I'mma spark up a (?), (?) sorrow
Keep goin' hard and fuckin' more hoes than Ricky Ricardo
Five-six with a Mac-11, detention my presence
Blacken yo section within seconds, no matter the preference

(?) for you niggas who like to talk but never move
See his (?) upon my chest, don't try me like a fool
Meanin' (?) on sight, my mind ain't right
Sippin' syrup and kryptonite
Gun cockin', suckers droppin' in the M like every night
I'm on a mission, got 'em wishin' that you make it back
Choppers poppin', shells droppin' then the line goes flat
I'm a Magnolia nigga, it's been in me since my birth
Others talk that shit and swallow spit
My Crime Click run this turf
Niggas havin' half, they flippin', floppin'
I'm a G, I'm never stoppin'
In too deep, I'm hellbound
Y'all wanna see my casket droppin'
Thuggin', pimpin', gangsta walkin'
Swag so fly, yo bitch-ass stalkin'
Nina is my passenger
So what's up with that shit you talkin'?
Forty reasons, ain't no question
My best friends are Smith & Wesson
Satan's soldier, flip the folder
So ya better count yo blessings
Sick of you niggas that talkin' that shit
And lyin' about the pistol packin'
I'm so, so hood, (?) something (?) good
I'm wishing you would
Let's get it crackin'
