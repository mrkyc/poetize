You may already have a catchy melody, and a fierce groove, but that's not enough
To take things over the top, you will need to employ the greatest weapon in the dance party arsenal:
You will need to start shaking your rear end
Or as some people call it...
Your hind-quarters
Your backside
Your bottom
Your buttocks
Your junk-in-the-trunk
Your badonk-a-donk
Your squash tart
Your J. Los
Your double-slug
Your wiggle bags
Your mud flaps
Your rump rockets
Your flesh pot
Your second face
Your bounce house
The jiggle twins
Your bubble pop
Your medicine ball
Your sonic boom
Your sit-biscuit
Your mumbler
Your rock tumbler
Your fun-cooker
Your subwoofer
Your horn section
Your launchpad
Mothra
The outback
The closer
Your crock pot
Your jumbo-tron
Your life's work
Your waffle irom

And shake shake shake...
Your booty
It's time to shake that freckle-muffin (The happy walrus with no tusks)
It's time to bake that turkey stuffin' (Your George Foreman grill)
Let your smiley bulldog loose
And put some juice in your caboose
Wiggle that rump-hump (Your dinner with Andre)
Its time to jiggle that jump-hump (The place where all the burritos go)
Dance to the beat that the DJ cuts
There's no "if"s or "and"s
Just butts
Let's get it going
Keep it going, don't stop (Fire it up!)
Let's get it going
Keep it going, don't stop (Give it everything you got!)
Let's get it going
Keep it going, don't stop
Use your bum to stir that soup
And shake it all around like Blue Man Group
Wave your hands in the air, like you just dont care
Raise the roof
The two-armed upward thrust with yell
The two-armed upward thrust with yell
The two-armed upward thrust with yell
Squeal like a pig, rolling in mud
It's time to shake that freckle-muffin (Your giant fluffy bears)
It's time to bake that turkey stuffin' (Minneapolis and St. Paul)
Dance to the beat that the DJ cuts
There's no "if"s or "and"s
Just butts
Let's get it going
Keep it going, don't stop (Fire it up!)
Let's get it going
Keep it going, don't stop (Give it everything you got!)
Let's get it going
Keep it going, don't stop
Use your bum to stir that soup
And shake it all around like Blue Man Group
Shake it 'till you bake it
Bake it 'till you wake it
Fake it 'till you make it
Shake it shake it shake it
Let's get it going
Keep it going, don't stop
Shake your flap cabbage
Your Band pockets
Your Gigantor
Your two mounds of mischef (Don't stop)
Shake your wiggle monkies
The gripper
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum
Shake your hipster
El Diablo
Canada
Your gelatious avatar (Don't stop)
Skake your boomwacker
Your reporter at-large
Or in this case, very large
Shake the flounder thats rounder than a giant quarter-pounder
Shake it 'till you bake it
Bake it 'till you wake it
Fake it 'till you make it
Shake it shake it shake it
Give it everything you got
Fire it up
Give it everything you got
Fire it up
Shake
