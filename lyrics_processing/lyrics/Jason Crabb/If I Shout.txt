For anyone who seen their mountain of sins disappear
For anyone who ever felt the hand of heaven reach down through their fears and dry their tears
For any life once empty, that now finds itself alive and full of songs, victory's songs
Then you'll understand the reason for the way saints of God may carry on
Chorus:
So if I shout know i'm shouting from a heart that's been washed clean
If I run, know i'm running from the past that's been redeemed
To the world, it might look crazy, there's just no telling what you're going to do in that moment Jesus gets a hold of you
Verse 2:
For anyone who knows the hope that keeps them moving on throughout troubled days
For anyone who knows they've got a future and a hope beyond the grave
Every life's a different story, how he led us out of darkness into light
There's no way to keep us silent, every breathes another chance to testify
Chorus:
So if I shout know i'm shouting from a heart that's been washed clean
If I run, know i'm running from the past that's been redeemed
To the world, it might look crazy, there's just no telling what you're going to do in that moment Jesus gets a hold of you

Yeah, so, if I shout know i'm shouting from a heart that's been washed clean
If I run, know i'm running from the past that's been redeemed
To the world, it might look crazy, there's just no telling what you're going to do when Jesus gets a hold of you
