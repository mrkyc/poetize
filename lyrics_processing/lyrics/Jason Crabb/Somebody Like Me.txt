When that old drunk stumbled in
Down the aisle and took a seat
Right in the middle of Amazing Grace
He could feel the judgment they were passing
Thought to himself
"Ain't that just how some folks acting"
He'd rather be on the street than in this place
Ooh, and with tears on his face
You'd think somebody
Would put their arm around him
You'd think somebody would hit a knee
Pull him in, say a prayer

You'd think somebody
Would practice what they're preachin'

Probably somebody like me

Nobody wants a part of
When he got up and slipped out
Nobody stood up
They don't wanna make a scene
So they let him walk outta there

Would wanna make a difference
Well, well I wonder who
That somebody could be
Probably somebody like me
Oh, can I get a witness
(Somebody, somebody, ooh...)
Oh, yeah, yeah
You'd think somebody
Would put their arm around him
You'd think somebody
Would hit a knee now
Pull him in, say a prayer, yeah
You'd think somebody
Would put their arm around him
You'd think somebody would hit a knee
Pull him in, say a prayer
That's what I'm talking 'bout right there
You'd think somebody
Would wanna make a difference
Well, I wonder who
That somebody could be
Probably somebody like me
(Somebody, somebody)

Probably somebody like me, now
