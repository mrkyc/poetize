To make it on my own
Time to say goodbye
And leave the life I've known
Foolish things that I regret
Failures I'd like to forget
I sift through them just like sand
I let them slip right through my hands
I'm letting go of all the pieces
That I've tried to keep from falling down
You're the only One
That can heal a heart like mine
I'm reaching out, so help me, Jesus
Take who I was and lay it on the ground
And leave it all behind
I'm trusting You one day at a time
I walk away no worries
Of what tomorrow holds
I won't look behind me, no
I'm good to go
Smiling 'cause I'm finding peace
And mercy for the memories
Faith is whispering "Amazing Grace"
I shake the dust off from this place

You're the only One
That can heal a heart like mine
I'm reaching out, so help me, Jesus
Take who I was and lay it on the ground
And leave it all behind
I'm trusting You one day at a time
One step in front of the other
Walking next to You
With each dawn I rediscover
You help me make it through
I'm letting go
I'm letting go of all the pieces
That I've tried to keep from falling down
You're the only One
That can heal a heart like mine
I'm reaching out, so help me, Jesus
Take who I was and lay it on the ground
And leave it all behind
I'm trusting You one day at a time
(One day, ooh, one day)
One day at a time
(One day, ooh, one day)
(One day, ooh, one day)
Help me, Jesus, help me, Lord
One day at a time
