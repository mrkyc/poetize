If you could only see the rock bottom where I've been
The too far gone, the lost too long, the chains that I was in
I had given up, almost had enough
I was down to nothin'
Almost at the end, something had to give
That's when He came runnin'

You can't change my mind
'Cause too many times He's come through for me
You can call me crazy, but a Savior saved me and He met me on my knees
Now that I'm found, I gotta shout, "I'll never be the same"
It's a leap of faith that ends in Grace
That's why I live this way
Hallelujah, that's why I live this way

Well, it's hard for me to think about where I would be today
If Jesus hadn't pulled me out of the grave I made
I had given up, had almost had enough
I was just existing
But Jesus called me out, turned it all around
And now I'm finally livin'

'Cause you can't change my mind
'Cause too many times He's come through for me
You can call me crazy, but a Savior saved me and He met me on my knees
Now that I'm found, I gotta shout, "I'll never be the same"
It's a leap of faith that ends in Grace
That's why I live this way
Hallelujah, that's why I live this way
Hallelujah, that's why I live this way
