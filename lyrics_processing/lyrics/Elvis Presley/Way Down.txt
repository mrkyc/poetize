Babe, you're getting closer
The lights are going dim
The sound of your breathing
Has made the mood I'm in
All of my resistance
Is lying on the floor
Taking me to places
I've never been before

Ooh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it

Way down where the music plays
Way down like a tidal wave
Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down

Ooh, my head is spinning
You got me in your spell
A hundred magic fingers
On a swirling carousel
The medicine within me
No doctor could prescribe
Your love is doing something
That I just can't describe
You might also like
Ooh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it

Way down where the music plays
Way down like a tidal wave
Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down

Hold me again
Tight as you can
I need you so
Baby, let's go

Way down where the music plays
Way down like a tidal wave
Way down where the fires blaze
