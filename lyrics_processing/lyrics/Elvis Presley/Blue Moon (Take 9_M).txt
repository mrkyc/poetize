Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Without a love of my own
