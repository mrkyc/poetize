Higher than the Billy Creek pine trees
Stoned like a stack of rocks
I'm gonna go somewhere they can't find me
I'm gonna give it everything I got

Yeah I'm on the run, I'm lookin' out
Searching for something that I still care about
I'm looking up to the sky
Fire On The Mountain, gonna let it burn so high

Shake the dirt off your shoes, come over, take a seat
Knock that chill off your bones
Got food on the fire, can I get you somethin' to eat?
Make yourself at home

Yeah I'm on the run, I'm lookin' out
Searching for something that I still care about
I'm looking up to the sky
Fire On The Mountain, gonna let it burn so high

Baby's gotta head on down
To the Mena Airport
Gonna greet that government plane
Try to stay out of court
And get me somethin' to snort
That C-I-A cocaine
You might also like
Yeah I'm on the run, I'm lookin' out
Searching for something that I still care about
I'm looking up to the sky
Fire On The Mountain, gonna let it burn so high

Meth shack in the back
Gave me a heart attack
With them bears flyin' up in the air
Smokey come around
Lookin' for a pound
I tell ya, it just ain't fair

Yeah I'm on the run, I'm lookin' out
Searching for something that I still care about
I'm looking up to the sky
Fire On The Mountain, gonna let it burn so high

I'm on the run
Lord I hope they don't find me
I'll give it everything I've got
If the creek gets low
I've got nothing to show
Except three hots and a cot
Son, I'm higher than that Billy Creek pine tree
Lord, and I'm a-feelin' stoned
If they ever try to come and find me
I ain't leavin' this world alone

Yeah I'm on the run, I'm lookin' out
Searching for something that I still care about
I'm looking up to the sky
