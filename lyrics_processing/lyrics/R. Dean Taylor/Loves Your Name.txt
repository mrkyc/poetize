Here you come (here you come), a toothbrush in your hand
(Keep a comin', keep a comin' my way)
With you tomorrow's never planned
When things have all been said and done
(Keep a comin', keep a comin' my way)
You leave with the morning sun

But in my heart you remain
'Cause love's your name

You're running free (runnin')
You're running wild (runnin')
(Sha, sha, sha la la la dee)
Nothing I could do would ever hold you to me

I need you hon', when I've come undone (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You pick the pieces up and you glue me (Glue me)
Together again
Together again
(Together again)

Oh, you're soft (you're soft) as the rain upon my face
(Keep a comin', keep a comin' my way)
Warm as the logs in my fireplace
My world's a joy when you're around
(Keep a comin', keep a comin' my way)
I know I could never tie you down
You might also like
Here in my heart you remain
'Cause love's your name

Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
(Keep a comin', keep a comin' my way)
Bah bah bah bum bah bah bah
(Keep a comin', keep a comin' my way)
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
Bah bah bah bum bah bah

Here in my heart you remain
'Cause love's your name

Into my life you spread your honey around
(Runnin', runnin')
You're the only one that took the time and knew me
(Sha, sha, sha la la la dee)

I need you hon', when I've come undone (Ooh, ooh)
You pick the pieces up and you glue me (Glue me)
Together again
Together again
(Together again)
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
(Keep a comin', keep a comin' my way)
Bah bah bah bum bah bah bah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
(Keep a comin', keep a comin' my way)
Bah bah bah bum bah bah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
