You were the sweetness of my life
My hopes and dreams, and you always were
When they'd ask me who I'm living for
I'd smile and say "Her"
Then he became a part of you, I just never was
I tried to pretend it doesn't hurt, but God, it does

Candy apple red, the color of her lips
Where I used to kneel and pray
Candy apple red, the sun going down
For the last time today
Candy apple red, the color of my life
As I watch it slip away
Candy apple red, someone please pray for me on Sunday

I recall warm sunny days
Flying kites from a windy hill
If I could hold you just once more
But I never will
He became a part of you, I just never was
I tried to pretend it doesn't hurt, but God, it does, it does

Candy apple red, the color of her lips
Where I used to kneel and pray
Candy apple red, the sun going down
For the last time today
Candy apple red, the color of my life
As I watch it slip away
Candy apple red, someone please pray for me on Sunday
You might also like
I can't turn back
Things are turning black
My hand's gone numb
Here it comes, here it comes
Here it comes, here it comes

Candy apple red, the color of her lips
Where I used to kneel and pray
Candy apple red, the sun going down
For the last time today
Candy apple red, the color of my life
As I watch it slip away
Candy apple red, someone please pray for me on Sunday

Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
