Oh, we were so much in love
She was all I thought of
But she met someone
Who said, "I love you, hon"
And it was too late
He left her to cradle the shame and the blame
A child with no name (No name)
In the spring we were gonna be married (Gonna be married)
She was my world everything in my life
But she ran and hid from the wrong that she'd done
In a dark back street slum

(Back street) Her own folks disowned her
(Back street) Her friends all scorned her
(Back street, back street girl) Lying scared and alone
(Back street) She met all the wrong kind
(Back street) The ghettos poisoned her young mind

Eighteen years old
In a room dark and cold
She sings lullabies
As her small baby cries
Scorned and alone
She missed her friends
And her mom and her dad
The good home she had (The good home she had)
She had to fight to survive (Fight to survive)
Give up her pride to keep her baby alive
So she sold her love to those who would call
Up the stairs down the hall
You might also like
(Back street) She felt the good in her dying
(Back street) She grew bitter from crying
(Back street, back street girl) Running scared and alone
(Back street) Yeah and what it did to her
(Back street) She lived like a rat in a sewer

A knock in the night
No one in sight
There at my feet
In the snow cold and deep
Cried her small baby son
Tear-stained the note
That she left on my door
"Love, please make him yours"
Somewhere she walks the night
Wrapped in dreams now never to be
Yesterday we held the world in our hands
World's apart now we stand

(Back street) It was dawn when they found her
(Back street) I placed some flowers around her
(Back street, back street girl) I never felt so alone
(Back street) As I stand here above her
(Back street) I know deep inside I still love her
Oh, I think of those good times (Back street livin' ain't easy)
When we laughed in the sunshine (Back street livin' ain't easy)
All those plans that we made then (Back street livin' ain't easy)
Life was so good then (Back street livin' ain't easy)
She will forever be deep in the heart and the soul of me

(Back street) If I'd only forgave her
(Back street) My love could have saved her
(Back street, back street girl) She was scared and alone
(Back street, so hard living on the backstreet)
