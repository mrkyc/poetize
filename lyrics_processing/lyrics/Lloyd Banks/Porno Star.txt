I don't even know how to explain it, you know
You know, from time to time she's on my mind, you know I mean, she's my kinda girl, hahaha
I know every now and then you might find somebody you feel like understands you a lil bit and you know
It's all good, man

Something like a porno star
She's something like a super freak (Uh huh)
I never seen her on tape before
But when she go low she's a pro-fes-sion-al
My kinda girl, porno star (Woo!)
She's something like a super freak (Uh huh)

I got a girl in my hood, see most niggas call her ho and diss her
Cause she's slowly growin' up to be like her older sister
She got a bad reputation so you don't hold and kiss her
And after one conversation you'd probably fold and twist her
It ain't hard to tell that honey dumb
She's 18 goin' on 21, mama don't know where she get her money from
Hoppin' in and outta cars, stuffed in the backseat
Lookin' to score big 'cause she fuck all the athletes
Somethin' like a princess gon' wrong
Used to be a ballerina, now she performs to the Thong Song
What happened to your plans to enroll in college
Now you'd rather slide down metal poles for dollars
Your fingernails and your toes is polished
But your brain's on freeze
In other words frozen knowledge
All your plans and your goals demolished
You grew up in Southside, why niggas know you a ho in Hollis, huh?

I still remember how it all started, school, cuttin' from class
Every boy you knew touching yo' ass
Heading no where fast, I ain't gon' lie shortie I used to laugh (Ha ha ha)
Cause you was the main topic on math
I seen her in the mall shoppin', now I'm contemplating 'bout stoppin' 'cause she could get me off like Cochran
Now back then it was poppin'
Spoiled, her daddy was pumpin (Uh huh)
He probably thought she'd grow up to get married or somethin'
But little did he know his little princess was a city ho
Pretty, all in the face but tight from the video
Damn, this bitch thick (Thick)
She on her Little Kim shit, see her hair match the color of her lipstick
Now this chick burn the love jewelry like Slick Rick (Uh huh)
And had a walk on her that'll leave you with a stiff dick, jeans had a sick fit (Damn)
To make a long story short
This ain't the type a bitch you wan' stick wit, yea
