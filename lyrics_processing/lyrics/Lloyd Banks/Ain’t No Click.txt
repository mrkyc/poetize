Yeah, nigga!
We fuckin' back! Hunger for More!
Tony's Home!
Yo, Banks, I told these niggas man
(Ya'll done fucked up now)

Ain't No click like the one I'm wit'
If the drama gets thick, it's the guns I get (Now)
G-Unit niggas is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin' where you from then sit (Down)
We gettin' dough everywhere we go
And it's killin' em' slow just to hear me blow (Now)
G-Unit niggas is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin where you from, sit down!

By now, I know you done seen me
On your stadium or TV, with 380 on the EV
I skeet babies on ya breezy
And I ain't' stoppin'
Only jake or Jacob could freeze me
Squeeze me, and it's bye bye gone
We got guns like Popeye's arm
I put a ring on every finger but the rats still askin'
Cause there's one on all of mine, I'm the rap Phil Jackson
I built the rep for murder on every Whoo Kid
Kay Slay, and Big Mike, admit it; the kid tight
And you ain't' even put up a fight, so it's back to the amateurs
Wrappin' your sandwiches, I'm hot now so the rats want to stand wit' us
They hop in the van wit' us and clap on cameras
I hit the clubs, now I'm back tourin' Canada's
Amongst weed smokers and crap-floor gamblers

Make sure the birds don't get brought to him
I watched Kobe go from the basketball court to the courtroom
Go 'head, try to do me harm, soldier
And you'll be in a black bag like grass out the lawnmower
And I'll be damn if I co-sign a old snitch
That was gangbangin' when Jaws was a Goldfish
I've been named New York's screamin' on the street
For bullying the baseline and leanin' on the beat
I'm well known now so you see me on the creep
Schemin' on a freak, fan base leanin' on the jeep
They walkin' wit the fire
So if you say Banks in you verse, then you better be talkin' 'bout Tyra
From P.A. to L.A., Atlanta to Texas
Nashville to Memphis, my buzz is tremendous
I pass through the city slow, but hit the gas on a silly hoe
Bounce like ass in my video
Ain't No click like the one I'm wit'
If the drama gets thick, it's the guns I get (Now)
G-Unit niggas is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin' where you from then sit (Down)
We gettin' dough everywhere we go
And it's killin' em' slow just to hear me blow (Now)
G-Unit niggas is runnin' this shit (Now) (Ayo Banks let me put some work in, it's been awhile)
If you ain't reppin where you from, sit down!

Ayo, uno, dos, tres, cuatro
My clique eat like the Twelve Holy Apostles
And bust down models
And plushed out Tahoes
Jewels froze, look like we hit the lotto
P89; my clip filled wit' hollows
Stunt in the club - get hit wit' yellow bottles
Don't speak ma, if ya neck don't swallow
Cause 50 push Bentleys and Dre push Diablos
That Eminem money got cash in my Escrow
Scrooge McDuck stays swimmin' in my cash flow
Yay' rap is crack, and I got the best blow - best flow
Banks' put me in the booth; let's go
Think like Cestro; the games in a lasso
Jump in the Benz without snaps on the petro'
God gave me this flow, so I am special
In 16 bars, nigga, I'm finished; finito!
Ain't No click like the one I'm wit'
If the drama gets thick, it's the guns I get (Now)
G-Unit niggas is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin' where you from then sit (Down)
We gettin' dough everywhere we go
And it's killin' em' slow just to hear me blow (Now)
G-Unit niggas is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin where you from, sit down!

We told y'all motherfuckers, man
Ya'll niggas look like us, smell like us, but y'all not us, man!
