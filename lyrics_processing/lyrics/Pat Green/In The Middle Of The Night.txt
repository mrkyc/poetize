In the history of winter
Black as a murder of crows
I'm six days clean and sober
With a bottle on the table
And a hurt inside that nobody knows...
One shot away from shooting
My soul straight through the ceilin'
And I could fly away from feelin'
All this pain that still ain't gone
Oh but flying's kind of risky
When your wings are made of whiskey
And I know that I'll come crashing down
Just after dawn
Chorus
When there's no one around
And the silence in your soul is the only sound
In the darkness that surrounds you
Are you hiding from the light
When you finally hit rock bottom
Will you do what's wrong or right
You're gonna find out what you're made of...
In the middle of the night
'Cause the night can keep a secret
And hold it deep inside
Every sin that keeps you sinning
Every lie you've ever lied
But my heart is bent to breaking
From all the hell I've put it through
All the love that I've forsaken
On the run from what is true
Oh now what you gonna do

In the middle of the night
Ah ohhhh
In the middle of the night
It's the coldest night in Boston
In the history of winter
Black outside like a murder of crows
Way down in the middle
Middle of the night and you find your self
In the middle of the night you gotta let it go
Way down in the middle
Way down in the middle
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
