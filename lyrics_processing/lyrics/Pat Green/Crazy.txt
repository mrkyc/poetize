Sleeping all dressed in white
For a moment I thought you were an angel
Come to take me home alive
You woke up and you caught me staring
You smiled and said "Fool,cut it out"
You said that I must be crazy
I said crazy about you, and I kissed you on the mouth
Chorus:
And if I am truly crazy, don't you know I like my life that way
If I'm really, going all out of my mind
Won't you hop on board, and make your getaway
Took a walk down by the seashore
Saw a beggar picking up some cans
Saw a little boy who had some salt in his eye
Reaching out for his momma's hand
Then I watched a stranger give that man a dollar
Watched the momma wipe the tears from the little boy's eyes
Then I stared up into the heavens
Said "Oh my God I'm glad that I'm alive
So Glad that I'm alive!"
Chorus:
And if I am truly crazy
Don't you know I like my life that way
(that way)
If I'm really, going all out of my mind
Won't you hop on board, and make your getaway

Turn 'em out at night so we can hide
Sometimes I sleep with all the lights on
It helps me to appreciate the night
Hear people talk about life all the time
How they remember a time so sad
Don't you think that life would be awfully boring
If the good times were all that we had
Chorus:
And if I am truly crazy, don't you know I like my life that way
If I'm really, going all out of my mind
Won't you hop on board, and make your getaway
And if I am truly crazy, don't you know I like my life that way
(that way)
If I'm really going all out of my mind
Would you hop on board and make your getaway?
