And out El Paso way
I've been doin' fine on Houston time
When the sun sets on the Copano Bay
From way up where the Red River flows
On down to the Rio Grand
I was born a little native Texican
And i'm proud to say that I am
Chorus
Yeah well I like Texas
Ain't it fine here
I like to pick my guitar down at Luckenbach
And drink that Shiner Bock beer
Yeah well I like Texas
Man there ain't no doubt
Just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin about
Well theres old dancehalls and little cafe's
Where you can get a taste of the Lone Star State
You can strap on boots and have yourself a laugh or two
Well theres no line dancing just straight romancing
That Hill Country love is what I fancy
Where the streams running clear and the skies they are so blue
Chorus
Yeah well I like Texas
Ain't it fine here
I like to pick my guitar down at Old Gruene Hall
And drink that Shiner Bock beer
Yeah well I like Texas
Man there ain't no doubt
Just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin about

One lukewarm beer to go
On the Sunday side of a roadtrip weekend
Lordy I was feeling so low
When somebody flipped on the jukebox
And I heard ol Bob Wills say
"Stay all night, stay a little longer" so I held on another day
Chorus
Yeah well I like Texas
On a Saturday night
Just let me listen to ol Gary P. Nunn
And everything will be just right down here in Texas
Man there ain't no doubt
Just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin' about
Yeah well I like Texas
Ain't it fine here
I like to pick my guitar down Stubbs Bar-B-Que
And drink that Shiner Bock beer
Yeah I like Texas
Man there ain't no doubt
Just listen to me cause I know what i'm talkin about
