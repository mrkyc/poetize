I sing them often as if she was some old lover I used to know
I wish I could follow them back to the homeland everytime
I hear one on my radio
Twin fiddles playing in my memory
My daddy sang the wonders of old Cowtown
Silver haired and he's still there under a sky so warm and fair
I'll tell you friends there's a song in every town
Chorus
So won't you sing me one more song about ol' San Antone
It seems like a dream now it was so long ago
And Jerry Jeff Walker can be just like a coat from the cold
I'm going on home
There's nothing short of the gospel hymns
I guess that why folks keep writin' them when I die I wanna go there too
Some day I hope to walk along heaven street
And I'll still be lookin' for my taco meat
And swear I hear steel guitars rising in the air
Chorus
So won't you sing me one more song about ol' San Antone
It seems like a dream now it was so long ago
And Robert Earl Keen he can be just like a coat from the cold
I'm going on home

She knows there's music in the dirt down there
Hill country rain its a cleansing thing
And all I have to do is see one and i'm sittin' in a shallow creek
Ain't got nothing to do ain't got nothing to do
Chorus
So won't you sing me one more song about ol' San Antone
It seems like a dream now it was so long ago
And ol' Guy Clark he can be just like a coat from the cold
