Likes to dance and drink and go wherever the wind blows
Gotta little threadbare gypsy soul
Gotta little threadbare gypsy soul
Gotta little wild streak in my heart
I guess that I have had it since I heard the music start
I gotta little wild streak in my heart
I gotta little threadbare gypsy soul
I like to hear the highway sounds
And I don't think that I'll ever settle down
I can't change and it's a sin
Hope St. Peter gonna let me in
Come on Pete won't you let me in
I wear this cowboy hat up on my head
And you can take it off me some time after I am dead
Gotta cowboy hat up on my head
Gotta a little threadbare gypsy soul
I wear these crusty shoes down on my feet
I could write a book about the places that they've seen
I got these crusty shoes down on my feet
I gotta little wild streak in my heart

Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever settle down
And I can't change and it's a sin
I hope St. Peter gonna let me in
Come on Pete won't you let me in
I know this crazy living just ain't right
Most of the time I'm smoking, drinking, looking for a fight
But I've been talking to Jesus every day
I've been talking to Jesus every day
And I got this girl back home I call my wife
If you ever met her I swear she would change your life
She's gotta little wild streak in her heart
But she's been saying hallelujah every day
I like to hear the highway sounds
I don't think that I'll ever settle down
I can't change and it might be a sin
Hope St. Peter gonna let me in
