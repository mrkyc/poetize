That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shining bright
You feel like you've lost your way
When those candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
You've got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say
He used to say soulshine
Was better than sunshine
It's better than a moonshine
It's damn sure better than rain
And the people don't mind
Cause we all get this way sometimes
You gotta let your soul shine
And shine til the break of day
I grew up thinking that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
Love can take the strongest man
And make him feel so alone
Now and then I feel a cold wind
Blowing through my aching bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said boy, at the darkness before the dawn
He used to say soulshine
Was better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
And damn sure better than rain
And now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
You gotta let your soul shine
Shine til the break of day
Well sometimes a man
Can feel this emptiness
Like a woman
Has robbed him of his bitter soul
A woman too
God knows
She can feel like this
And when your world seems so cold
You gotta let your spirit take control
Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than a moonshine
And damn sure better than rain
And oh, now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
You gotta let your soul shine
Shine til the break of day
Soul shine
It's better than a sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
And the people don't mind
Cause we all get this way sometimes
You gotta let your soul shine
