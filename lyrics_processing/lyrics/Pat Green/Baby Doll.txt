She says its hell on me this working down at the diner
Some people say man she was hot back when she was younger
Yeah well she was a dancer when she lived in LA
Well she was someone's baby doll
A beauty queen to someone long ago
For the midnight show
And if you close your eyes
You can hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
Back when all the world was young
She was someone's baby doll
She stops and checks her reflection in the bathroom on her lunch break
She says "I still look good for someone half of my real age"
Some people say "Man I bet she still makes love like an earthquake"
Yeah but man she ain't easy ... she ain't letting you in my friend, my friend
Its time to wake up baby doll
Put your best dress and your high heals on
And dream your gone
When you close your eyes
You can hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
Back when all the world was young
She was someone's baby doll

She says I feel like I'm just sitting here wasting my days away
It's time to move on baby doll
And walk away just like you did before ... when you wanted more
When you close your eyes
You hear the music playing
You can see her dancing underneath the spotlight
And when she sleeps she dreams she's back in Hollywood
When she was a younger girl ... a pretty heart in a tainted world
Not sure who you wanna be
Your daddy's little drama queen
I hope that when you find yourself
