There ain't no such thing as the fountain of youth
Two wrongs never made it right
Grass ain't always greener on the other side
Better save your money for a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may
Only Wil Rogers never met a man he didn't like
Always throw the first punch when it comes to a fight
It ain't over till it's over and the fat lady sings
Only quitters and losers throw the towel in the ring
Well, I hope you ain't working on a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may
It's a hush my mouth land sakes alive
I don't believe that fisherman smell the same when they die
Never put the cart before the horse
Unless he knows how to push it of course
Seems like I'm always dreamin on a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may
And it was grandpa who said son you can't buy love
You can jump in with both feet, but don't jump the gun
Stay out of trouble count your lucky stars
Never get drunk in two states inside the same bar
Seems like I'm always drinking on a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may

You only answer to one he's the almighty beholder
Bird in the hand is better than two in the nest
Don't you count your chickens before they hatch
Always save the loving for a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may
It's a hush my mouth land sakes alive
I don't believe that fisherman smell the same when they die
Never put the cart before the horse
Unless he knows how to push it of course
Seems like I'm dancehall dreaming on my rainy days
Count your blessings come as they may
Talk being cheap well I took their advice
And the older I get the more I know they were right
Works for me may not work for you
Everything I said was the goddang truth
Well, I hope you ain't lonely on a rainy day
Count your blessings come as they may
And they're etched in my mind I can never forget 'em
