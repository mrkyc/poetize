These folks think just cause I won some American Idol show
Everything ain't the same
Man you know they see me on t.v. or up in the crib every week
And you think everything is all good
I mean, it really is all good man
Keep secure
From hangin out late in the Bama to Beverly Hills California
From heatin up the leftovers to becomin a restaraunt owner
From a litle block, from a little hood
To the whole world and it's all good
And if ya didn't know, I was a star before the show
But if it was
No block, no Ruben
No hood, no Ruben
No boulevards, no Ruben
No corner spots, no Ruben
No stayin up late nights, tellin mama everything gon' be alright
And if it weren't no you
There would be no Ruben
From wearin my big brother's clothes
To buyin him a new wardrobe
From listenin to Fred Hammond, to hangin out with Fred Hammond
From a little block from a little hood
To the whole world and it's all good
And if ya didn't know I was a star (I was a star)
Before the show (before the show)
But if it was
You might also likeNo block, no Ruben
No hood, no Ruben
No boulevards, no Ruben
No corner spots, no Ruben
No stayin up late nights, tellin mama everything gon' be alright
And if it weren't no you
There would be no Ruben
This goes out to the barbershops
The black man's country club
And this goes out to the single mothers
At the laundry mat foldin covers
Your my inspiration and you've been my motivation
And that's why I had to do this dedication
Cause if it was
No block, no Ruben
No hood, no Ruben
No boulevards, no Ruben
No corner spots, no Ruben
No stayin up late nights, tellin mama everything gon' be alright
And if it weren't no you
There would be no Ruben
No block, no Ruben
No hood, no Ruben
No boulevards, no Ruben
No corner spots, no Ruben
No stayin up late nights, tellin mama everything gon' be alright
And if it weren't no you
There would be no Ruben

If it weren't for the hood (No Ruben)
If it weren't for the boulevards (No Ruben)

Stayin up (late night) late nights

And if it weren't for you
There would be, there would be, no Ruben
Ay Ruben I don't think they heard you
Let's take em to church
If it weren't for the block (I said no Ruben)
If it weren't for the hood (I mean no Ruben)
If it weren't for the boulevards (Can you hear me no Ruben)
And and the corner spots (Hey, no Ruben)
Stayin up (late night) late nights
(Tellin my mama) Tellin mama (everything gon' be) alright (hey)
