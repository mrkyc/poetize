I'm going home today
I believe I've missed each and every face
Get there and play my music
Turn on every love light in the place
It's time I found myself
Totally surrounded in the circles
Oh, oh, my friends

Please, celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Play me one more song that I'll always remember
I can recall whenever I find myself too all alone
I can sing me home

Uneasy highway
Traveling where the westerly winds can fly
Somebody tried to tell me
But the man forgot to tell me why
I gotta count on being gone
Come on mama, come on daddy
It ain't what you want from me, yes
I'm this strong, I'll be weak
You might also like
Please, celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Play me one more song that I'll always remember
I can recall whenever I find myself too all alone
I can make believe I'm never gone
Oh, sing me home
Please, celebrate me home
Give me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Play me one more song that I'll always remember
Oh yeah, play me one more song, hey
Somebody said celebrate me home

I'm finally here but I'm bound to roam (Oh)
Come on celebrate me home
(I can't wait to see you)
I'm finally here but I'm bound to roam
Come on celebrate me home
(I can't wait to hold you)
I'm finally here but I'm bound to roam
('Cause I definitely know I miss you, yeah)
Come on celebrate me home
(Come on and celebrate, celebrate)
I'm finally here but I'm bound to roam
(Come on and celebrate, celebrate)
Come on celebrate me home
I'm finally here but I'm bound to roam
(You know I'm finally here)
Come on celebrate me home
(And you don't have to worry, no, no)
I'm finally here but I'm bound to roam
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
Come on celebrate me home
(So come on and celebrate, celebrate)
I'm finally here but I'm bound to roam
(Celebrate)
