Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
And you can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I'll feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't

I'll close my eyes and then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
(When you're holding me)
The morning will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight, yes

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't (If you don't)
You can't make your heart feel something it won't (Something it won't)
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I'll feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
If you don't
You might also like
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close and don't patronize

(Lay down with me) I can't make you
(Tell me no lies) I can't make you love
(Just hold me close) I'll lay down my heart
And I know that you know and I know that you know and I know that you know
That I love you, baby
Oh yeah
(Lay down with me) Here in the dark
(Tell me no lies) In the final hours
(Just hold me close) Oh, I wish! Oh I wish I had the power
To make you love me
