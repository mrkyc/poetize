You are my girl now, light skinned with the pretty toes now
And if you got a csrub now let him go now, life is too short
To settle now, c'mon now, in the club now
Hold up the duckin with the po po now
Get that money anyway now, and if you work
Hard you gotta play now, c'mon now

Can I get your attention for a minute
You need to know that we gotta live it up girl (live it up)

To everybody who be livin it up in the hood
On the block, everywhere in the club gurl and alll of my thugs
To everyone in the east (give it up)
