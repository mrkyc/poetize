Hmmmmm...
It's the smarter thing
(Ohhh ewww... Oh whoa... Ohhh....)
Aww Baby What If
(What if, What If, What If)
Yeah, Yeah, Girl
(What If, What If, What If)
Spend the day at the spa
(Anything you want)
Different day different car
(Anything you want)
Max out my card if you wanna
Whatever girl it ain't no problem, nooo
Take a trip on a yacht
(Anywhere you want)
Leave them bags we gonna shop
(Anywhere you want)
Girl you know I'll do whatever it takes
You know I love you like I used to love cake
Would you be cool if things changed?
If I didn't roll the Benz
And you didn't push the range
I know what we got it's gon last, babe!
(Don't be mad)
But I still gotta ask
You might also like(Chorus)
What if I was broke
What if I was slim
What if I couldn't sing and I didn't win?
What if I had to catch the bus
I'll still stay with my momma so there ain't no making love
Baby, what if I had to use the pay phone
Just to get my game on
Would you still wanna put it on me?
What If, What If, What If
(Aww Baby What If)
What If, What If, What If...
Take the keys to my crib
(Anytime you want)
Just come over take a dip
(Anytime you want)
How much you need girl Imma front you
There ain't no limit to what I'll do, nooo
Imma break you off
(Uhhh...)
With the ghetto love
(Anytime you want)
Take your time it ain't no rush
(Anytime you want)
I'm not trying to do nothing to mess it up
But if I do I'll spend four millions to make it up
Would you be cool if things changed?
If I didn't roll the Benz
And you didn't push the range
I know what we got it's gon last, babe!
(Don't be mad)
But I gotta ask you
(Chorus)
What if I was broke
What if I was slim
What if I couldn't sing and I didn't win?
What if I had to catch the bus
I'll still stay with my momma so there ain't no making love
Baby, what if I had to use the pay phone
Just to get my game on
Would you still wanna put it on me?
What If, What If, What If
(Aww Baby What If)
What If, What If, What If...
(Hook)
Baby, I would give up everything
(I don't care about none of this)
My life don't mean a thing
(Not unless your a part of it)
Girl I know for sure
That your the only one I need...
Tell me how would your life be
Would you still be my baby?!
(Chorus)
(music fading)
Tell me yea, yeah....
Ohhh, ewww....
Ohhhh....
(What If, What If, What If)
