And I been thinking of what I was gonna say
When you got here, um, I want you to relax
Let your hair down cause tonight is the night
For me to blow your mind
It's time to relax, it's time to unwind
Whatever's on your mind, girl, leave it outside, outside
Tell me your fantasy girl, cause I want you to be, free to explore
There's so much more if you let me
If you let me blow your mind tonight
Baby, it'll be okay if you let go with me
Baby, just let me take time control tonight
Take ya to another place, girl
Somewhere that you can't explain
I know that you've had your reservations
And your speculations
Of the things I did in the past
But I wanna clear your mind out
Left all those things behind
Now I'm with you, girl, I want to make you feel good
Let your hair down, baby
Take your clothes off
It'll be alright

Baby, just let me take time control tonight
Take ya body to another place, girl
Somewhere that you can't explain
Now I want you all over me
Do it on the table, freaking in the shower
Have you in the kitchen, over by the window
Let me play with your body
Starting at your navel all the way to your toes
Girl, I want you to reach your peak baby
I wanna blow your mind
Let me blow your mind tonight
Blow your mind tonight, girl
Take you to a fantasy
Somewhere that you've never seen, yeah

I wanna love ya from your toes to your back to your navel
Let me lay with you, let me play with you
Satisfy your every need, let me love on you, baby
