And two years later in October we said Goodbye
(Unh) And my bed's been so cold in the space
You occupied
And what I want to say is
Baby, I'll miss you
And when I see you in the street, I'm a speak
But now it's official
Ladies, I'm single
So when you see me on the street
Don't be scared to speak
I'm a need another lady
I'm single
Girl I tried everything to make you smile. (uhm yeaaah)
I gave you the world on a platter but you wanted out
(Ooo ooo)
I'm not into keeping somebody
That don't want to be mine
Ooooh Baby, I'll miss you
And when I see you in the street, I'm a speak
But now it's official
