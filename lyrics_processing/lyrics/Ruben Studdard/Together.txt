Since the day that we met girl
I ain't never had anyone make me feel this way
And my heart is sure it wants to be with you
Wanna give you the whole world, oh
If you make the promise to me, you're gonna stay
Without you guiding me, I'm lost and so confused

What will it take to show you I'll be by your side
Girl, I got you and I want to give you what you never had
Girl, everyday I hope to make you part of my life
Cause you know me and I know you
Girl, your love is where it's at (Ooh)

I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last
And be the one that got your back
Ain't nothing ever that bad that we won't be together
And though we both made our mistakes
And some we never wish we made
But we'll be okay if we just stay together (Ooh)

I know he left you stranded
And you paid the price when you messed up your life oh
Girl I know you're so afraid
But I can't right the wrongs he did
I know you saw the lipstick on my window
And wonder'n how many chick's been to my home
I've done my share of playing games
But for you I given up that life
You might also like
What will it take to show you I'll be by your side
Girl I got you and I want to give you what you never had
Girl everyday I hope to make you a part of my life
Cause you know me and I know you
Girl your love is where it's at (Ooh)

I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last
And be the one that got your back
Ain't nothing ever that bad that we won't be together
And though we both made our mistakes
And some we never wish we made
But we'll be okay if we just stay together

Baby you're the one I've waited for
Because you gave me what I need and more
Girl, it's clear that we are meant to be
Together, we should be together, eternally (Ooh)

Girl I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last
And be the one that got your back
Ain't nothing ever that bad that we won't be together
And though we both made our mistakes
And some we never wish we made
But we'll be okay if we just stay together
I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last
And be the one that got your back
Ain't nothing ever that bad that we won't be together
And though we both made our mistakes
And some we never wish we made
