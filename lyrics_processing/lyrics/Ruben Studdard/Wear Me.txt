I would love to be, I'm almost ashamed to say
I would love to be your clothes, your clothes, baby
I'd wrap around both your legs like the dress you're wearing out
Oh, so tight, feel so bright, If I could I would
I'd lay my head on your chest
Like the necklace round your neck
Show me off never take me off, if I could I would be
Everything in your closet that you put on
Think of my name, baby, put me on yeah
Wear me like Gucci, wear me like Louis
Girl, take me home and take it off just to put me on
Take it off just to put me on, take it off just to put me on
Put me on, put me on, girl, put me on
You can trap me in like in heels
And I will lift you up
High above with so much love
If I could I would
Raise you up like your teddy or your negligee
Baby girl there's nothing I won't pay
To make you feel sexy, show that I, I won't lie
If I could I would be
