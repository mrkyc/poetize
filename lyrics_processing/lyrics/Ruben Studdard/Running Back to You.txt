How can you forgive me
When I've often gone astray
How can You think of me
When I do things my way
Turning my back from You
The One who loved me first
Having my own desires
Renewing worldly thirst

You told me You loved me
And I should make up my mind
You tell me come back now
But I keep wasting time
Feeling so very weak
You say I can be strong
I feel I've gone too far
You tell me to come home
You love me still
And I know this is real

And I am running back to You
I see You're standing there for me
Your arms are open wide
And I don't have to cry no more
You're standing there for me
And I am running back to You
Why did I go away
When I know I am no good
When I'm on my own
You might also like
You told me you could keep me
But I've turned it away
I've failed you so much now
I don't know what to say
Using the same excuse
That I am just a man
You tell me You've been there
And show your nailed scarred hands
So I can see
Now I know I am free

And I am running back to You
I see You're standing there for me
Your arms are open wide
And I don't have to cry no more
You're standing there for me
And I am running back to You
Why did I go away
When I know I am no good

I have taken advantage of Your love & grace
Forgive me Lord and take me home
Take me home
I'm running to you Jesus
Please take me home
See, I've been in this wrong way too long
And I can't do right anymore
I'm tired of pain
And I don't like fear
But Lord I want to be more sincere
I never should have left Your side
Return me to Your guiding light
You're standing there for me
