How would you like it if I talked about your skin
The way you wear your hair (Oh girl)
Would you like if I talked about your butt
Or once a month
Turned into someone that was hard to love
How would you like it if I didn't like your smoke
Didn't like your polish you be wearing on your toes
If I didn't like your neck-a-lace
Or what you cooked for breakfast
Would I be wrong?
Would I be wrong?

Why you wanna change me
Flip all the things that really make me
The way that I am used to make you happy
Baby, why you wanna change me (Girl, oh)
You used to like your big ol' teddy bear (Girl, oh)
You used to let me get it anywhere
Now baby, it's crazy
Why, why
Why you wanna change me?

Now what if all I did was pick apart your friends
'Cause they ain't got no ends (Oh girl)
What if I talked about your face in the morning
'Cause we know that you ain't cute in the morning (No)
What If I criticized the way that you be eatin'?
And when you sleepin' you be doin' that heavy breathin'?
What if I was at you 'bout your house creepin'?
Would I be wrong?
Would I be wrong? Oh

Why you wanna change me?

We used to love breakin' up (knowing we'd be together again)
And we used to love the arguments ('cause we makin' love by the end, yeah)
How you gon' change everything and turn (Turn it all around)

If it ain't broke then why you wanna change?
