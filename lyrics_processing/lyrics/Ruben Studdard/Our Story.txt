I remember what ya had on
I remember what I said to ya
Scuse me miss how ya doing
I remember what you said
You was doing fine but you was in a hurry
So I gave ya my number and I didn't think you would call
But you did, now here we are
And this is our story from beginning to end
Baby listen, you'll see how we became lovers
Turn it up, you'll hear how we became friends
Love is a part of our story
Hate is a part of our story
Making up breaking up
It's all in here if you just turn it up
It's our history to a beat
And, girl, here is our story
Oh, baby, I remember the first kiss
And how good your lips felt
I can't forget, can't forget
I's on your porch outside
You put my hands on your thighs
Us going up to your room and you giving me all of you
I remember them tears that fell from your eye
When you caught me red-handed in a lie
I remember how you felt then, I remember how I felt then
I remember how I prayed and girl I'm glad ya stayed
