I've run out of answers, I've run out of time
I'm so confused that I'm losin' my mind
It's gonna take a miracle to help me this time
I'm traveling a road that has not one sign
Help me, have mercy for me
Set my soul free
And let the bell in my heart ring, oh
This is my cry, hey, this is my plea, ya see

I need an angel, I'm calling an angel
Send me an angel down
I need an angel, I'm calling an angel
Send me an angel down

I'm carrying a load that's too heavy for me
I've nowhere to go so I'm down on my knees
I'm tryin to see the forest, but there's this one tree
I can't understand why I'm sinking so deep
Help me (help me, help me)
Have mercy on me (Won't you have mercy on me)
Set my soul free, and let the bell in my heart ring
This is my cry, this is my plea

(Send it all down)

Oh something inside of me
Tellin' me the morning will come
(Morning will come), yes it will
Oh sometimes it's hard to face the truth so we run (we run)
God if you care at all
Please don't let me fall by the wayside (oh no)
Please be my guide, would you light my path (light my path)
Take me! Shape me! Mold me!
Change me! Teach me! Fill me! Save me!
