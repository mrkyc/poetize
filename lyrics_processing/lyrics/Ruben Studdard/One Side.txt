Uh
Tell your mother
Its allright
Tell your sisters and brothers
Its ok
Your friends are on the way
Tell them calm down
Cause they dont even know
We gon'work this out
Cuase thats how it starts right there
Telling everybody, round here
Whats going on between us
We can't let them all in here
Cause everybody ain't for us
Specially me,when they over here
One side of the story,and thats your side of the story
And they make up every story,i wonder what would happen'if they
Only heard my story
That i love you only, baby can't u see?
They dont know about you and me
I got an idea, u should get away
Somewhere with a view of the ocean
For a couple days
All night, gurl we can may break up
To make up, love
And realize that nobody but me is there for us.?
Mm,and if the phone rings, let it ring
If there's a knock at the door,let it knock
If this the end of the world, let it end
You might also likeAt least i will be with my girl,let it end
Cause everybody anint for us
Specially me.when they only hear
One side of the story,and thats your side of the story
And they make up every story,i wonder what would happen'if they
Only heard my story
That i love you only, baby can't u see?
They dont know about you and me
When they see you cryin
They dont know i'm high
When they feel your pain
They dont know im werse off
But i hold it in
Till i see you agian
Cause i dont want to answer to nobody but you
They olny heeeaaaarrrrrrr,your side
One side of the story,and thats your side of the story
And they make up every story,i wonder what would happen'if they
Only heard my story
That i love you only, baby can't u see?
They dont know about you and me
They dont know
What we know
Baby tell them that
They dont know
