Baby, I know it's been awhile since you seen me
And there's a lot of things I wanna show you
Most things you never knew I could do
Listen, baby, boo, I wanna whisper in ya ear
Tell you what I'm all about
Re-introduce myself and remove all doubts
You can let your hair down, you can let yourself go
Cause I came back to let you know that
It's the return, it's the return of your velvet teddy bear
Girls, I'm here
It's the return, it's the return of your velvet teddy bear
Have no fear
Oh, are you ready
Yes, are you ready, yes, are you ready
Yes, are you ready for me
Yes, are you ready for your velvet teddy bear
Girls, I'm here
Shortie, the vibe you're giving me is straight sexy
And I gotta do what your body tells me
Cause I meet expectations better yet exceed em
You best believe I'm a rider nova Casanova
All of the above when it comes to making love
