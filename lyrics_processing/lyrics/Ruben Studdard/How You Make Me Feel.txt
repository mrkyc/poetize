Talk about something else other than love
Afraid to go near it if it's so special
Why is everybody breaking up?
Haven't I been hurt enough?
Why do you still wanna go there with me?
I don't who to trust
And I may not have enough faith to believe
But you knew my heart was a good place to start
Girl, you became my sunshine everywhere it was dark
Mistakes that I made, you said it's okay
Girl, I need you by my side, right here to stay
That's how you make me feel, to be in love again
That's how you make me feel and I hope this won't ever end
That's how you make me feel, no question that it's real
Nothing can change the way you make me feel
All of my pain, I was taking it out on you
I just didn't know you would be the one to show me how to live again
Then you gave me back my soul
Had enough of sad songs that reminded me of her
But with you right here with me it's a whole different world

I could still feel you around me even when we're apart
So much for the pain, it all went away
And now I won't let you go girl, I'm here to stay
That's how you make me feel, to be in love again
That's how you make me feel and I hope this won't ever end
That's how you make me feel, no question that it's real
Nothing can change the way you make me feel
And now I know just what an angel really looks like
You saved me at the right time
Your heart is my home and I have to feel just the way you make me feel
Just the way you make me feel
That's how you make me feel
That's how you make me feel, to be in love again
That's how you make me feel and I hope this won't ever end, no
That's how you make me feel to be in love again
Nothing can change the way you make me feel
That's how you make me feel
That's how you make me feel and I hope this won't ever end
That's how you make me feel, to be in love again
Nothing can change the way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
