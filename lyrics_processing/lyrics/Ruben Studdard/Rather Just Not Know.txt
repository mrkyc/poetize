Make me believe it's all in my mind
Tell me you was out with your girls last night
And that my boys didn't see you with another guy
Make me believe I'm tripping
When your cell phone rings at three in the morning
You get up and leave the room
Tell me another lie instead of the ugly truth
Baby girl, I'm not stupid
When you talk to me like I don't know
What kind of cologne I buy
When I find the Dolce & Gabana, it ain't mine
Baby, lie to me one more time
I don't want the truth, no, no, no
I don't wanna have to forgive you for
Anything that you might have done wrong
Honestly I'd rather just not know
I don't want the truth, no no no
I don't wanna have to forgive you for
Anything that you might have done wrong
Honestly, I'd rather just not know
I can't sleep all night
Trying to convince myself that we're alright
And it's sad that the truth is I know that you're doing wrong
But you're still my right

I don't want the truth, no, no, no
I don't wanna have to forgive you for
Anything that you might have done wrong
Honestly, I'd rather just not know, just not know
Girl, don't tell me how y'all met two months ago
Sugar, I'd rather just not know
I'd rather keep believing you still love me so
I'd rather just not know
I don't want the truth, no, no, no
I don't wanna have to forgive you for
Anything that you might have done wrong
Honestly, I'd rather just not know
