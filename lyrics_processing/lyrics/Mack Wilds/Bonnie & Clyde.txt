Ooh, who knew you'd try to do you like you do
Fronting hard like fucking me ain't cheating, baby shame on you
It ain't like we've been doing different things
Cause you were mine before you two began
Past times of lovin' you
Liquor, sweat and touchin'
The break-ups, make-ups
And kissing every inch of you
And (ah, ah) I-I took a back seat on love after you
I mean I cried after you
Part of me died after you
But here we are doing the same things
Tell him he broke us into two
So I feel the vibe, look in your eyes
Put pride aside, pull your panties to the side
Cause I wanna have you for the night
Shit, hope that he don't mind

If you want it (where you want it)
Then I got it (Girl I got it)
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK (know I'm tryna get it)
When you want it (when you want it)
Girl I got it (girl I got it)
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You might also like
Ooh, who knew you'd do me baby like you do
Yeah, we runnin' wild while he at home
Calling phones off of you
Oh I swear to God, if he were me
Why would I trust you?
Knowing his calls still get through
Addicted to the love of memories
And fulfilling your fantasies
So I close your eyes
Kiss once or twice
Then hit it right and I know shit this isn't right
But I need to feel you for tonight
Bonnie & Clyde down for life

If you want it (where you want it)
Then I got it (girl I got it)
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK (know I'm tryna get it)
When you want it (when you want it)
Girl I got it (girl I got it)
