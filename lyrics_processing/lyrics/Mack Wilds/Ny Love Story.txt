You know we been talking for a minute, right

You know...but....I like you
This ain't that everyday, ordinary. This is different

Guess ya wondering if I'm worthy of a Stevie Wonder kind of love
You fuck but shit, you curvy as the feeling love
Although you know that my hearts gone, gone
Let a cold nigga feel, ya warm touch every time we chill
(I think I want you to) It's like your so bad in every way from french tips to your french braids, I'm just saying (so what you wanna do)

I'm not blind to what you wanna do
See the real don't hide, what you feel is true
Baby I don't mind, making love all through
The night but I, need a loving to

Well I can front like I ain't know in love, why you throw it love, then posterize it love
Stuck in the two but meanwhile feeling something, I guess them all back shots ain't nothing
Back in the days you wouldn't let it go
Made it sound precious for a minute though
Try to find a way just to let you know
You gave it to me good but I want more
