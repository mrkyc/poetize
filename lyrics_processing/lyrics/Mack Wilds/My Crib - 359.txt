Hello? Hello? Yo
Alright, King Pusha, drop classics
Like AI no practice
More blow with 'em, no traffic
Dollar for dollar motherfucker I match you
We produce the beat I ?
Jiggaflow, now who better than Jackie
Pusha T huh, Mack Wilds here, ? Salam in the air
We can take it back to my crib
We can get away, no photographs
Chillin' all alone in my home, what you on?
My crib
If you wanna roll, let's roll
Why you tryna front, you know what you want
Who's this I see?
Brown eyes, 5'3"
Legs right, ass tight
Just what I need to make my night right
But I need some change
Money come and go like planes
Oh fly down, what's your name?
`Cause you're looking like the perfect love song
Girl, you got me going with your clothes on
We can do this right here but that be so wrong
So what you say? Girl won't you roll my way?
We can take it back to my crib
We can get away, no photographs
Chillin' all alone in my home, what you on?
My crib
If you wanna roll, let's roll
Why you tryin' front, you know what you want
I feel no shame, I want you, don't play
All types of sweet things
Jump from my lips to you wanna roll babe?
You meet me downtown, send your girls home now
I'm home bound. What you say?
'cause what I'm really wanting is for you to stay
'cause you looking like the perfect love song
Girl, you got me going with your clothes on
We can do this right here but that be so wrong
So what you say? Girl, won't you roll my way? Oh
You know what I'm about, fly it out
Personal chauffeur, buy it out
Test drivin', try it out
I give bow, what niggas be lyin' 'bout
Pick a property, let's play Monopoly
Ph means nobody's on top of me
360 Views, overlooks the water got her feelin' like a cruise
We can take it back to my crib
We can get away, no photographs
Chillin' all alone in my home, what you on?
My crib (we can go to my crib)
If you wanna roll, let's roll (my crib, my crib)
Why you tryna front, you know what you want
Hello? Hello?
Yeah. I just got my girls with me and I'm
Just tryin' to see where we can go and kick it you know
Nothing major
Well, I
