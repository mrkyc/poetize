Big dawg who? Salaam Remi, yeah

We can take it back to my crib
We can get away, no photographs
Chilling all alone in my home, what you on?
My crib
If you wanna roll, let's roll
Why you tryna front? You know what you want

Who's this, I see?
Brown eyes, 5'3"
Legs right, ass tight
Just what I need to make my night right
And I need some change
Money come and go like planes
You a fly dime, what's your name? Hah
Cause you're looking like a perfect love song
Girl, you got me going with your clothes on
We could do this right here but that'd be so wrong
So what you say? Girl, won't you roll my way?

We can take it back to my crib
We can get away, no photographs
Chilling all alone in my home, what you on?
My crib
If you wanna roll, let's roll
Why you tryna front? You know what you want

I feel, no shame
I want you, don't play
All types of, sweet things
Jump from my lips 'til you wanna roll, babe
You meet me, downtown
Send your girls, home now
I'm homebound, what you say?
Cause I'm really wanting you to stay

Cause you're looking like a perfect love song
Girl, you got me going with your clothes on
We could do this right here but that'd be so wrong
So what you say? Girl, won't you roll my way?
Oh, oh, oh, I
