I guess you're sitting there in wonder, love
Guess you wonder if i'm worth of
A stevie wonder kinda love
We fucked, but shit
You're curious of feeling loved
That's how you feeling, huh? (yeah)
Although you know that my heart's gone, gone
You let a cold nigga feel
Your warm heart every time we chill

(i think i want you too)
Its like you're so bad in every way
From french tips to your french braid
I'm just saying
(so what you wanna do?)
'cuz i can think of a few things
Lets make sure we're on the same page

I'm not blind
To what you wanna do
You might also likeSee the real don't hide
What you feel is true
Baby, i don't mind
Making love all through
...the night, but i
Need a love thing too
Yeah... i want you

Well, i could front like i ain't knowing, love
While you throw it, love
Then posterize it, love (if that's what you want)
Stuck it in too
But meanwhile, feeling something
I guess some more back shots ain't nothing
Back in the days, you wouldn't let it go
Made it something precious for a nigga though
Tryna find a way just to let you know
You give it to me good, but i'm wanting more

(i think i want you too)
Its like you're so bad in every way
From french tips to your french braid
I'm just saying
(so what you wanna do?)
'cuz i can think of a few things
Lets make sure we're on the same page

I'm not blind
To what you wanna do
See the real don't hide
What you feel is true
Baby, i don't mind
Making love all through
...the night, but i
Need a love thing too
Yeah... i want you

So what's a brother to do
Got me wishing i knew
What you want and
I know you're wondering too
I'm playing like i'm too cool
But i'm fronting, hey
My homies telling me to let it go
But you know i never let it show
But you ain't low, baby
Yes i know

I'm not blind
To what you wanna do
See the real don't hide
What you feel is true
Baby, i don't mind
Making love all through
...the night, but i
Need a love thing too
