Weed, Hennessy, a lil' sour (HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!)

Hey!

She feelin me, cup full of Hennessy
Baby show me love but, fuck me like the enemy (HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!)
Ha! By far baby less clothes
Yachts! Nah we don't do the fishin boats
Steak and lobster, I'm tryin to serve 'em
Turks and Caicos on the first, missed the flight
24 karats neck fully golden
Great ass black shades rollin
Speedin in the European car like it's stolen
Coke Boyz made it to the top like we totin
My nigga Chinx Drugz told me (HA!) Motherfuck they feelings
Let's get these motherfuckin millions

After this you 'gon remember me, it's not a case not too big
I will have your bitch callin over and over time a lineup
You soft wit' it she just want it wild rough
Boss wit' it took nothin got her riled up
And it's on and on everything around us

A young nigga from the slums of the city
Fresh but not the flow so gritty
