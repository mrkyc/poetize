I'm that bottle of Jack
I'm the roach on your dresser
I'm the last day of school
I'm the last day of summer
I'm that song in your head
I'm your drunken tattoo
I'm your hungover Sunday
I'm that one time on shrooms
I'm your dusty degree
Cost you hella money
I'm a ten dollar tip
From that party at Twenty
I'm a 5 A.M. phone call
From your drunk ex-girl
I'm the scream of your baby
When she enters the world

Drunk on a feeling
Love, you're gonna need it
If you're down in the dirt
Or you're dead on your feet
You can say, say, say, my name
Drunk on a feeling
Love, you're gonna need it
If you're drinking tonight
If you can give me a ride
Won't you say, say, say, my name

I'm the shit and the fan
I'm your first walk of shame
I'm the blood on your hands
I'm the suburbs in flames
I'm that Section 8 housing
I'm aluminum siding
I'm your black eye throbbing
And the sunglasses hiding
I'm your best friend's trunks
On the telephone wire
I'm your night on the town
On the day you get fired
I'm the last dollar bill
In your duct tape wallet
I'm that first french kiss
Since you came out the closet

Drunk on a feeling
Love, you're gonna need it
If you're down in the dirt
Or you're dead on your feet
You can say, say, say, my name
Drunk on a feeling
Love, you're gonna need it
If you're drinking tonight
If you can give me a ride
Won't you say, say, say, my name
Ricky Reed is real
Ricky Reed is real (Whoa-oh-ah-ohh)
Ricky Reed is real
Ricky Reed is real (Whoa-oh-ah-ohh)

(Ahh)
(Ahh)

Drunk on a feeling
Love, you're gonna need it
If you're down in the dirt
Or you're dead on your feet
You can say, say, say, my name

Drunk on a feeling
Love, you're gonna need it
If you're down in the dirt
Or you're dead on your feet
You can say, say, say, my name (Say my name)
Drunk on a feeling (Drunk on a feeling)
Love, you're gonna need it (Yeah)
If you're drinking tonight (Drinking tonight)
If you can give me a ride (Give me a ride)
Won't you say, say, say, my name (Ohh)
Ricky Reed is real (Ahh)

Say, say, say my name
Ricky Reed is real (Ahh)
