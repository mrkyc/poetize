Then it's two AM
Don't know where we are
But that's okay
Pile into the car
Fore we hit the hay
Hit the mini-mart
And if I die tonight
Bury my bones in the bourbon and mud down below
All the first world problems of all the sad souls
Drinking windex and rum with their coworker bros
But that wasn't me
No I never gave up
May my corpse grow a rose for every girl that I love
And when the sun eats the earth then we'll all turn to dust
So who fucking cares that we drink way too much?
Okay
Me and my friends
Go our separate ways
Then it's two AM
Got nowhere to stay, so one more round
Fill another cup
I've wanted to drown the demons in my gut

Bury my bones in the bourbon and mud down below
All the first world problems of all the sad souls
Drinking windex and rum with their coworker bros
But that wasn't me
No I never gave up
May my corpse grow a rose for every girl that I love
And when the sun eats the earth then we'll all turn to dust
So who fucking cares that we drink way too much?
Fuck a bridge
Fuck a bridge
I've burned of all them
Full of one night stands, and two faced friends
Fuck a bridge
Fuck a bridge
That sticks for the wine
I'm a sink to the bottom
I'm a take my time
If I die tonight
Bury my bones, in the bourbon and mud down below
All the first world problems of all the sad souls
Drinking windex and rum with their coworker bros
But that wasn't me
No I never gave up
May my corpse grow a rose for every girl that I love
And when the sun eats the earth then we'll all turn to dust
So who fucking cares that we drink way
Too, drink, way too
