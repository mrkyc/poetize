All my life, work like a dog
Raised by wolves
Running from the law
All my life, chasing these chicks
Trying to get paid, make your own rules and you got it made
I've spent my whole life trying to get it
And now that I've got it, I'm like, "Okay"

I'm like...
Pushin' the '79 Beamer
Full of gasoline-er
Stop at Dairy Queen-er
Sizzurp in my Blizzard
Breaking in my Radio Shack speakers
Crispy new wife beater
So fresh and so cleaner-er
Tints up in my windows
Stuck in the bumper to bumper traffic (traffic)
Ain't got time for that shit
To overheat my classic
Leave it on the freeway (naw)
Walking down the shoulder in my flip flops (flip flops)
Bunny at the bus stop? (bus stop)
Party back at her spot?
I'm ready

Sign a record deal at a FedEx
Fax it to my legal
Now my shit is legal (kinda)
Tweet it to the people
Richer than my relatives with real jobs
Thought this was a hobby (nope)
Thought that you could stop me
Come and get it
