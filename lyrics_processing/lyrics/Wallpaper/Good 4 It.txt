I might have actually died
You gotta bring me to life
I need you really, really, right now, right now
Where I'm at, I don't know
Phone is dead: zombie phone
I need you really, really, right now, right now
Like really, really, really right now, right now

How to stay alive though
How the fuck should I know?

Without some help, sometimes
Need my friends, sometimes
To bail me out, sometimes
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it

I don't know how to explain
I got in over my brain
I need you really, really, right now, right now
Super low, ocean floor
Starring in a shit show
I need you really, really, big time, big time
Like really, really, fuckin' big time, big time

Without some help, sometimes
Need my friends, sometimes
To bail me out, sometimes
You know I'm good for it
Without some help, sometimes
Need my friends, sometimes
To bail me out, sometimes
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it
You know I'm good for it

Do you remember, that one time?
Well this is way worse, than that one time
Well you needed me then
Like I'm needing you now
Get your ass over here
And help me out
