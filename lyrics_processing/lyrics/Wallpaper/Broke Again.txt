Catch the bus to visit my friends at the corner store
Money problems and pretty girls, everything we know
And we only steal the things we need but can't afford to buy
And we only need a drink to drink, a drink to drink tonight

When I go out, out, out, I'm going in, in, in
Going hard, so hard, like ooh

Rich girl, I don't even like you
But I'mma show you how a broke boy get down
And when a broke boy fall down, he get up
Bad luck, credit card declined for the fifth time
I guess I'm broke again, damn, broke again, broke again
But I'm not broken, I'm not broken, broken

Rolling deep to the house party in fake Louis Vuitton
But we're most likely to succeed with this box of Jones
And I only steal the things I need but ain't got time to wear
And I only need this chick right here to come back to my place

When I go out, out, out, I'm going in, in, in
I'm going hard, so hard, like ooh
You might also like
Rich girl, I don't even like you
But I'mma show you how a broke boy get down
And when a broke boy fall down, he get up
Bad luck, credit card declined for the fifth time
I guess I'm broke again, damn, broke again, broke again
But I'm not broken, I'm not broken, broken

Yeah, ok
It's a disappointment what you implied
Not sure my bank account's on the slim side
And I been know to be spotted at Lehmann's
Stuffed in my purse, 7 shirts that I've stolen
, gotta slap some greens
So how you feel about a Lean Cuisine, boy?
The day I get my paycheck, Seagrams and latex
It's on, on, on

Rich girl, I don't even like you
But I'mma show you how a broke boy get down
And when a broke boy fall down, he get up
Bad luck, credit card declined for the fifth time
I guess I'm broke again, damn, broke again, broke again
But I'm not broken, I'm not broken, broken
