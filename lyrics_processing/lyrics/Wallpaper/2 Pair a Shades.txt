2 pair a shades
We wear 2 pair a shades

When the morning sun rise, got to cover my eyes
Cause I barely went to bed
I was up all night double-fisting cheap wine
I need something for my head

Cause the cool kids do what the cool kids want, yeah
And a hot girl wear what a hot girl want, yeah

They wear 2 pair a shades at the same time
(2 pair a shades, 2 pair a shades)
I wear 2 pair a shades in the sunshine
(2 pair a shades, 2 pair a shades)
2 pair a shades at the same time
2 pair a shades at the same time

Got my Chonies on blast with my 2 pairs on
Break into my neighbor's pool
Screaming, "Y'all ain't shit!" when the cops roll up
Now I'm barefoot running with nothing to lose
You might also like
Cause the cool kids do what the cool kids want, yeah
And if I lose my mind it don't mean I'm lost, naw
Oh no

Check this out, I got the feelin'
Drop top down, sunburn is peelin'
In the sand, people are starin'
They don't know, know why we wearin'

2 pair a shades at the same time
I said, 2 pair a shades at the same time
(I wear 2 pairs)
2 pair a shades in the sunshine
(I do what I wanna do)
2 pair a shades at the same time
(I do what I wanna do)

I do what I want to do
I do what I wanna do
2 pair a shades
I do what I wanna do
2 pair a shades
I do what I want to do
I wear, I wear, I wear, I wear 2 pair
2 pair a shades at the same time
(I do what I wanna do)
2 pair a shades at the same time
(I do what I wanna do)
Nah nah nah nah nah
2 pair a shades at the same time
(I do what I wanna do)
I do what I wanna do
2 pair a shades at the same time
(I do what I wanna do, do)
