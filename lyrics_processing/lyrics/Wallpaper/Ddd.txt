Hit Trader Joe's for the 2 buck chuck
20 some bottles costs 40 some dollars
Bennies for days ain't tryin' to show off
But gonna throw a party at my girlfriend's loft
Can't call her shorty 'cause she's taller than me
6'3" in NYC for Fashion Week
Just skipped a beat to emphasize I date models

My friends are always tellin' me
"You got gangsta sensibilities,"

Invite mad neighbors so we don't get rolled
Noise violate courtesy 5.0
Get my stuff in my room and then lock the door
So dudes in hoodies don't be stealing my cell phone
Wait, I think somebody stole my iPod
Damn, somebody definitely stole my iPod:
Homeless dude on the sofa
Or the rando dude sippin' on wine coola
Ahh yeah
