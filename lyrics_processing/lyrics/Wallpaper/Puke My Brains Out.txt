I wanna puke my brains out...

Bases loaded, I'm up to bat
Based and loaded, imagine that
Still up and coming, haven't came yet
Cuz' I'm a zombie, brain dead
Take Adderall to study
Adderall to party, pharmaceuti-call me
Puke my proverbial brains out, Dali
Captain and cola tsunami in Bali
Nope
I'm in my apartmente
No AC, muy caliente
Late on rent day, but always on time
I got 5 on it: high five

I wanna puke my brains out
I wanna puke my brains out
I wanna puke my brains out
I wanna puke my brains out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, puke my brains out
You might also like
Man I can't think straight
Gotta get my brains outside of my face
Like white girls on Cinco de Mayo
College girls on day after finals
If you wanna wanna party, party
If you wanna wanna hear your heartbeat
Get your guts out, on the outside
Touch your tonsils and open up wide

I wanna puke my brains out
I wanna puke my brains out
I wanna puke my brains out
I wanna puke my brains out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, puke my brains out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, puke my brains out

Ass up, brains down
Hold your hair back and listen to the sound
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Broke boys, geek squad
On your knees just praying to God, like
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Prescription addiction to internet porn
Generation of the living dead trying to get born out the
Inbox, vagina, the zombie inside ya
Clawing at the walls of your stomach in light of the
Stimulation overload, boring boring boring boring
Filled up on soda, and sunblock, and chlorine
Cause life is a race, it's a fight to the death
So drop it to the floor, touch your tonsils and clear your head

Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, puke my brains out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, out
Na na na na, puke my brains out, out, out, puke my brains out

Puke my brains out
