Tank full of gas
Where to go from here? oh
Break into to Six Flags with me
Three AM and the rides are free
When the sun comes up where do you wanna be?

Well let's find the cheapest flight
And get on that plane tonight
And feel that ahh
I know you've always wanted to
Well right now I dare you to
And feel that ahh
