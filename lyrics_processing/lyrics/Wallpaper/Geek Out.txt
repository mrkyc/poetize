This record, crayola
So spin it, payola
She grape jelly, my purple soda
Her body tight, granola
I'm from the Bay... Hola
Trying to get paid, gorgonzola
Geek squad, rum and coca cola
I'm tripping out, about to fall over

I'm like outside of my mind
All the way-a-ay now, ay now, now now

Geek out
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Geek out
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Geek out
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Geek out
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

Ugh
Bass boosted, Stump music
Weekend spaz
Just lose it, go stupid
Party crash
P-p-puffing on sticky
Eyes redder than a hickey
Hella tipsy, Jameson whiskey
Turned up to the max, I'm tryna get in a batch
Baby think I'm a chair, she wanna sit on my lap
She think I'm a DJ, cuz' I got scratch
Or probably a rapper, because my pockets fat
I'm double fisted, I'm twisted, I'm on one
Hella shots but I ain't talking 'bout a gun
I came in this thang tryna function
I left with a big booty woman
(Woo!)

Now this ain't no 8th grade dance
I want to see everybody
Doing the Steve Urk' til they feet hurt
And ladies (yeah?)
Do you sing as good as you look?
Then repeat after me
