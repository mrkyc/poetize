In small town down in Georgia, over 40 years ago
Her maiden name was Music 'til she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then, not a penny to their name
They believed the one you vowed to love should always stay the same

And on the land his daddy gave him, a foundation underway
For a love to last forever, or until their dying days
They built a bond that's strong enough to stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind

And they made their house from a toolshed
Granddaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

My mama raised five children, four girls and there was me
She found her strength and faith in God and a love of family
She never had a social life, home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job to pay a bill or two

My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money, but he gave us all he had
He never made the front page, but he did the best he could
Folks drove their cars from miles around to let him look underneath the hood

And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

There'll never be another place in this world
