You're sneakin' out the back door taking it down the street
And I know
You're thinking that you got some little secret up your sleeve
But I know
You'll be back around with your hat twisted in your hand
Beggin' me please
And I bet I let you in again 'cause it's just
One more drop in the bucket
One more tear I've cried
One more think I love to hate about you
One more m,m,m, let it slide
That's the way you do me but when you do it to me
I'm beggin' you to do it to me one more time
Now I know
You only ask for trouble takin' up with a ladies man
But you know
Just the thing to say when the spit really hits the fan
Lord knows
I'm sleepin' with the devil and there's gonna be some hell to pay
But you'll find a way
Of making me believe that baby it's just
One more drop in the bucket
One more tear I've cried
One more think I love to hate about you
One more m,m,m, let it slide
That's the way you do me but when you do it to me
I'm beggin' you to do it to me one more time
You might also likeYou spend my money til it's gone
But then you rock me all night long
The way you hurt me is a crime
The way you love me is so fine
Lord you make me crazy but when you do me baby
I'm beggin' you to do it to me one more time
One more drop in the bucket
One more tear I've cried
One more think I love to hate about you
One more m,m,m, let it slide
That's the way you do me but when you do it to me
