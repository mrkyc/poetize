Twice as smart, but afraid to say
I'm just here to provide the t & a
Because I'm a woman
He'll get the gig no matter how hard I bust my ass
I better shimmy if the boss man makes a pass
And if I'm in the big chair baby better watch out for broken glass
Because I'm a woman
And if my skirt's too short then I'm asking for it
That's how the story goes
I'm guilty if I lock it up and I'm
Guilty if it shows and I
Live with a fear that no man every knows
Because I'm a woman
And if I'm strong I'm a bitch
And if I'm free I'm a whore
And if I'm home with my babies you won't find me in the pages of "cosmo"
'cause honey that ain't nothin' but a bore
But I have a dream I am a thing
Of beauty and power
Give me love, give me good love and I
Blossom like a flower
Because I'm a woman
You might also likeThere are places in this world I can't even show my face
I got to walk behind the man I got to keep my place
And they don't even see all the good gone to waste
Because I'm a woman
And somewhere on this day I will not even be born
When they detect the weaker sex from my mother's womb I will be torn
The man-child gets the love and I get the scorn
Because I'm a woman
And if I'm strong I'm a bitch
And if I'm free I'm a whore
And if I'm home with my babies you won't find me in the pages of "cosmo"
'cause honey that ain't what they're lookin' for
But I have a dream I am a thing
Of beauty and power
Give me love, give me good love and I
Blossom like a flower
Because I'm a woman
Because I'm a woman
