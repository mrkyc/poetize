I get a little, and then I want a lot
I get a minute, and then I run the clock
See he be in it, but barely hits your spots
So he don't get it now, and I'm right up the block
So at this time
Make your excuses to leave, 'cause you need your boy to put that fire out, like right now (Right now)
Girl, you can cum as you please and I guarantee you're just some
That's right (That's right)

'Cause all your talk has been foreplay, all day, I'm ready, baby
I swear the touch of your body, on me (On me)
Got me feelin' like I'm the one, girl, we should go

Let's go to the mo, let's go to the mo (Go)
Does he kiss you like that?
Let's go to the mo, let's go to the mo

It's getting crowded in here, I want that to myself
I didn't plan on putting my hands on no one else

We should go, we should go up these stairs
