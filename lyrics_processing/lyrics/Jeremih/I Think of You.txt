Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
(Oh)

I gave you the best that you ever had
Gave you one dose and got you addicted
I could own that, all night and all day
Serve you on my plate, girl, you so delicious
Last night we had a good time gettin' faded
Wake up in the morn', you was gone
It's been on my brain, all day replayin'
Like we had it on record
I miss every minute
I take plenty chances
My love for you is bigger than a mansion
More than you imagine
I want all of them kisses
Mistletoe before Christmas
If you ain't got it, don't get it
If you got time, it's no limit

Baby, won't you give me somethin'
That I wanna do?
When I see the sun set
Yeah, I think of you
I think of you
(I think of you, I think of you, I think of you)
You're all I want too
(I think of you, I think of you)
Left panties by my nightstand
Now I think of you (I think of you), I think of you

Lovin' my baby, yeah, you givin' me the sweet talk
Love's up and down, it's like livin' on a see-saw
Do me a favor, baby, why you blamin' me for?
All I wanted was love, babe
Last night we had a real good time, we was naked
Bumpin' and makin' love
Got me with all these games you're playin'
It's time for us to grow up
Don't care 'bout winnin' (Yeah, yeah)
Come on, baby, you got the answers (Yeah, yeah)
You ain't gotta be a dancer (Yeah, yeah)
All I need is your love
Girl, you won't change my mind, haha
And I can see you hesitatin'
So, baby
Baby, won't you give me somethin' (Babe, oh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
That I wanna do? (Yeah)
When I see the sun set (Yeah, yeah, oh, girl)
I think of you (Baby)
I think of you (Oh, woah)
(I think of you, I think of you, I think of you)
You're all I want too (I think of you, I think of you)
Left panties on my nightstand (Oh yeah)
Now I think of you, I swear, I think of you

I wish every day was your day off (Day off)
Goin' hard every night like it's the playoffs (Woah)
You give me the energy, I like to play off
Tell me is the feelin' mutual or am I way off?
Be real, be real, stay real (Real)
Pour your heart out, baby, I won't let it spill (Spill)
I know the ones before me probably said they never will
And broken promises'll break you down
But how you feel is not an illusion
I'm not tryna add to the confusion
Break your all access codes and abuse 'em (Damn)
You layin' all over me 'cause you understand me
Swear I love you so much, I love your whole family
Bedroom dresser, full of your panties (Woah)
We make the room feel like summer, Miami (Damn)
No stressin' whenever you leave
'Cause ain't nobody in the world fuck you better than me
