Yehey
Girl I still kiss your head, in the morning
Make you breakfast in bed, while your yawning
And I don't do everything, how you want it
But you can't say your man, don't be on it

Cause I know true love ain't easy
And girl I know it's you, cause you complete me
And I just don't want you leavin'
Even though I give you reasons

Cause baby sometimes, I can tell just by your faces this part of us been gone for so long
And I know there's no replacing what we had going on for so long
But when it hurts, I can make it better
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever
We been through the worst, made it through the weather
Our problems and the pain (Pain), but love don't change, ooh ooh

Girl you still hold me close when you see me
And you still make me know that you need me
And I know sometimes you don't believe me
But you stay on my mind, so believe me
You might also like
Cause you have my heart don't break it (Oh no don't break it girl)
Girl when times get tough, don't hate me (Ohh)
And it all adds up, we gone make it (Gotta make it)
Cause when you mad, I know you can't fake it (Ohh)

Cause baby sometimes, I can tell just by your faces this part of us been gone for so long (So long)
And I know there's no replacing what we had going on... for so long
But when it hurts, I can make it better
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever
We been through the worst, made it through the weather
Our problems and the pain (Pain), but love don't change

Hold me down and I'm gone do the same...for you love
I been through a thing... for you love
I want this together even though it gets better...
Or worse

Cause baby sometimes, I can tell just by your face this part of us been gone for so long (So long)
And I know there's no replacing what we had going on... for so long
But when it hurts, I can make it better
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever
We been through the worst, made it through the weather
Our problems and the pain (pain), but love don't change
But when it hurts, I can make it better
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever
We been through the worst, made it through the weather
Our problems and the pain (Pain), but love don't change
