You know my eyes up on your face (Face)
My hands up on your waist (Your waist)
I limbo go low-low-low-low
I might get me a taste
That Henny got me feelin' nasty
Go give me ride-ride like a taxi
I seen that ass just walk past
I couldn't let you walk past me (Whoa, no)
Girl let me take this somewhere we're naked
Forget 'bout what we do (Forget 'bout what we do)
Don't wanna wake up
Later tonight and
Not be right next to you (Not be right next you)
What is this feeling I cannot deal with
All I wan' feel is you (All I wan' feel is you)
All I wan' feel is you (All I wan' feel is you)
All I wan' feel is you
