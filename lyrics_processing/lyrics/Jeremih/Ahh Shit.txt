Ahh shit, ahh shit, ahh shit
Nigga feeling good, she did
Dammit, I should, alright
Now we finna blow, green lights
And this is goin' down like

Yolo, yo, ho, on that, for sure
Bet that shawty wet, I'm rocking her row boat
Heard she like it going deep
May I take a photo?
No referees up in the ring
Yeah, I prefer them low blows
Her shit pop, paw paw, four-four
I cuff her ass, I'm no cop, but she call me Robo
Never had a four loco, never had a four loco
But Wayno pour me up a four I'm leaning like a cholo
Gone man, gone man, even on my own, man
You kid, I'm a type of grown man
You rent, I'm a type of own man
Your girlfriend o-on me, swear he don't know, man
Now I'm all in her shit, now like bro, man
Now tell me how many licks does it take to
Break her, put her to sleep? And 'bout time that she wake up
I'm fresh of a flight from the heat to the Lakers
And still on a high off these trees from Jamaica

And this is goin' down like

Digest, I just live in that projects
Now I'm in that penthouse, salute my progress
Respect that process, admire my guess
Fuck being modest, nigga, admire my Goddess
'Cause she bad, that's obvious (Woah)
She thick, that body is
Probably is hot as Abu Dhabi is
And it's going down like (Like what?)
Elevators to where the lobby is (Yeah)
And tonight I'm on that brown like Bobby is
It's my prerogative, I can show you how to live
Every little step you take will be in shoes Guiseppe makes
My tenderoni, the one and only (Only)
Fuck me two times in case the first one get lonely (Nice)
Ah shit, now we fuckin' talking (Talking)
Or is we talking fucking? Or what you suckers talking? (Huh?)
I keep buying rides (Rides) like I suck at walking
The motto's money talk, I say what you suckers talking, huh?
Ahh shit
Nigga feeling good, she did
Dammit, I should, alright
Now we finna blow, green lights
