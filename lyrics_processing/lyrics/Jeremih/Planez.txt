This one goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that playa-ass nigga Thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride
Where playa-hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame muh'fuckers can barely survive

Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big, when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit cost?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
Hope it ain't talk, no

I could put you in the Mile High Club
What's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp?

Tell her, "Be free, baby, spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane"
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30,000 feet on your knees in them Pradas
Makin' freaky shit come up out her
You might also like
Get high, baby, roll one
Cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land, we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know 'bout
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can
Ain't nobody gonna hear
Would you like it better
If I hit the West Coast?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk

I could put you in the Mile High Club
What's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp?

Tell her, "Be free, baby, spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane"
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30,000 feet on your knees in them Pradas
Makin' freaky shit come up out her
Get high, baby, roll one
Cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know 'bout (Cole World)
Tonight, we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out (I got it, I got it, I got it, listen)

You need a nigga that's gon' come over and dig you out
You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put you out
You need a nigga that's gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big, it's like a foot is in yo' mouth
And you ain't babysittin' but my kids all on your couch
And oh, you nasty, oh, oh, you nasty
Both graduated, so fuck keepin' it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far, my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo'ed yo' bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thing in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn, don't make me beg
But I will if I need to, 'cause for real, girl, I need you
I could put you on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit, I got a pill I could feed you, Cole!
I could put you in the Mile High Club
What's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
