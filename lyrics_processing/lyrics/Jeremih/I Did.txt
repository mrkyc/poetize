She told me do her body right, I did
She said she want me spend the night, I did, I did
She want me hit it when she wake up, I did, did
She said, "Boy, don't you mess my hair up", I did, I did

Yeah, her body be calling, I be on that mission
She like the position, waking the neighbors
Got thirty-one flavors, I'm doing her favors
She doing them tricks, she just did a splits
God dammit, she thick
Scream my name when I hit it
Wrote my name on her sheets
I did it, I did it

She told me do her body right, I did, I did
She said she want me spend the night, I did, I did
She want me hit it when she wake up, I did, did
She said, "Boy, don't you mess my hair up", no, I did, I did

Yeah, her body be calling, I be on mission
She like the position, she be waking the neighbors
Got thirty-one flavors, I'm doing her favors
She doing them tricks, she just did a splits
God dammit, she thick
Scream my name when I hit it
Wrote my name on her sheets
I did it, I did it (I swear)

I did, I did
I did it, I did it
I did, I did
I did
I did (Yeah-yeah)
(Yeah-yeah)
I did

And my mind runnin' around, racing
Don't stop, no need to pace it
Waterfall like she in the Caymans
Pussy so good, I almost came in
Whip it like she work it in the kitchen
Hit it from the back, doing the dishes
Now I'm kissing her on the kitten
Told her not to scream, she didn't listen

You're the only one I want hittin' it
Head to hick, come huddle up with me
Touch me like no other man touch me
I don't care for no nigga this way
Camera phone, I turn it off for you
I will never turn you off, boy
I just wanna lay in your arms
When you're mine, know there is no more
She told me do her body right, I did
She said she want me spend the night, I did, I did
She want me hit it when she wake up, I did, did
She said, "Boy, don't you mess my hair up", no, I did, I did

Yeah, her body be calling, I be on that mission
She like the position, waking the neighbors
Got thirty-one flavors, I'm doing her favors
She doing them tricks, she just did a splits
God dammit, she thick
Scream my name when I hit it
Wrote my name on her sheets
