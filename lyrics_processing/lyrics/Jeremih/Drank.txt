Pardon my behavior
I'll apologize later
Say sorry later
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, drank, drank
Said if you leave with me tonight
I won't judge you, no-no
Blame it on the drank, baby, yeah-yeah, no-no
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby

You know who you dealing with
You know who you down (Work)
Put yo' money down put ya (Head)
In the headboard, baby
Let's go to war, baby
First time I couldn't ignore it, baby
How you come and shut the place down? (Place down)
A pretty face, you throw up with your face down (Face down)
I couldn't help but think 'bout how you taste
I couldn't help but think of how you kiss
You lookin', glisten all up on my neck (On my neck)
Could make me know enough just one time (One time)
Ay, ma', let's get on dummy dummy one time (One time)
Just screamin', "Daddy, daddy" one time (One time)
You keep your body bangin' like a 9
You know that any minute, girl, it's mine

I don't know, no, I don't know you now
But all I know, know is I'm gon' love you down
DJ Khaled say, "J, just hold 'em down"
Way you wind and roll them hips I hold you down
Can't help that pussy tastes like green apple Crown (No)
Got me so drunk, you need some thumpin' 'round
To beast up on you, left side
Legs up, talkin' peaced up
Girl, your body's amazing
If you ain't hear that from your own mind
You'd probably trip if you heard me
Have your ass screamin' out, "Jeremih" (Jeremih)
Girl, go 'head, light up the Marley (Go light up the Marley)
Do not know how you got topless (Don't know you got topless)
We should take trips to the tropics (Trips to the tropics)
