(Ear Drummers)
Ha, you know the saying
(Mike WiLL Made-It)
I'm just a phone call away
Make the late night a great night

Let me be your stimulation
I could be your occupation
Work you like a 9 to 5 (Oh, oh-oh)
Plus put in that overtime (Oh, oh-oh)
Careful what you do to me
Girl, everything I do to you, I hope that you do for me
And when the light's low p-p-p-pop a bottle of the Goose, please
Twist up a couple loose-leaves (Seduce me)

Girl, welcome to my bed
Come here
You thought it would be easy, -sy, -sy, -sy (Ayy)
-Sy, -sy, -sy (Whoa)

Sexy, I should get to know
Been thinking lately, girl, we could get more physical
(Won't you call?) 773-779-Love, oh-oh, oh
Them panty drawers is all I need
Falling off of your body
(Won't you call?) 773-779-Love, oh-oh, oh-oh

Better now than even later
Let me be your innovator
Feels so right when I'm right with you (Oh, oh-oh)
They lyin' if you not the truth (Oh, oh-oh)
Ms. Co-Star, let's proceed
You got that fire, that third degree
Yuh, this is how it's supposed to be
And when the light's low p-p-p-pop a bottle of the Goose, please
Twist off a couple loose sleeves, seduce me

And welcome to my bed
Baby, won't you come here? Yeah
Thought it would be easy, oh (Whoa)

Sexy, I should get to know
Been thinking lately, girl, we could get more physical
(Won't you call?) 773-779-Love, oh-oh
Them panty drawers is all I need
Falling off of your body
(Won't you call?) 773-779-Love, oh-oh, oh-oh

Okay ('Kay), girl, I'm not him
Put it down, down
Okay ('Kay), girl, I'm not him
Put it down, down
Okay ('Kay), girl, I'm not him
Put it down, down
'Cause I know you's a little freak
Let it out, out
Sexy, I should get to know
Been thinking lately, girl, we could get more physical
(Won't you call?) 773-779-Love, oh-oh
Them panty drawers is all I need
Falling off of your body
