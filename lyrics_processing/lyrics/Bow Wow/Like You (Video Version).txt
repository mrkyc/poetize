I ain't never had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you

Now I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen 'em all but ain't none of them at all
(Like you)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed 'cause ain't none of them at all
(Like you)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just
(Like you)
And baby that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we first got together
Started hangin' out, you was
Skeptical at first, had to figure out if
I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out but
I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned into my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady
'Cause baby, you know

Your love is amazing to me
Can't wait 'til I see you
(I wanna be with you again)
And every time you're out on the road

Okay, we, hit the mall, pop tags, spend a few G's and
Hit the runway to a new season
(Season)
It ain't nothin', you're spoiled and what I care for
Feel like I ain't doin' enough that's when I share more
(Share more)
I give you this, give you that, what you need, love
(Love)
You know I got it, holla at me if you need love
(Love)
And affection, 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but I'll do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get with you when I can so that's how I let you know
And you be trippin' 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holler to right after my shows
And I was trippin' in a sense I was tense
From my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together say whatever
Since I met you my life seems so better
I ain't never had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you
I ain't never had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
