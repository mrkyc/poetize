You're my
You're my
You're my baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
You're my baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

It was the summer, 2001
All before the drama begun
When we first met
I seen you sittin' out on your steps
You was broke down cryin', a mess
So I interfered
I asked what's the reason for tears
I was wishin' you could tell me your fears
But I'll start with ya name
You told me how ya man playin' games
So I said that it was time for a change
And you just laughed
But it looked like you ain't laughed in while
I was glad I could give you a smile
Then we both blushed
But really, girl, it ain't no rush
I was thinkin' maybe we can discuss
A future for us
'Cause homeboy just got you crushed
You need to leave that clown in the dust
Trust, I just wanna talk
I'm thinkin' I can give you a call
And we can pick it up where we left off
I'll holla tomorrow (Girl, I understand)
See Bow Wow LiveGet tickets as low as $326You might also like
Girl, I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's alright, aww baby
But that don't change the fact that you fight and you stay cryin' every night
Nah, baby
Girl, you gotta let him know
You can't live like this no more
Nah, baby
Can't ya see
Together you and me could be so special, baby (We could be so special)

Our feelings get greater
A million days later
Talkin' all night, we stay up, but
Here comes ya ex
Returned with the drama and stress
All the nonsense you just left
But yet, you accept
And go back to try it again
Then return with a broken heart that I gotta mend?
That's unfair
I only been your lover and friend
Homie there, he just front and pretend
But you don't care
The life he leads is unsafe
I would never place my hands to your face
But still I chase
Cat and mouse
First you kick him out
Then you at his house
What is that about?
I can't figure you out
Even your friend said I was better
But you listen to 'em never
Like uh-uh whatever
So the next time hurt you again
You already knew where you should've been
And that's with me
Girl, I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's alright, aww baby (That you're loyal to your man, yeah)
But that don't change the fact that you fight and you stay cryin' every night
Nah, baby (That don't change a thang)
Girl, you gotta let him know
You can't live like this no more
Nah, baby
Can't ya see? (Baby, can't ya see?)
Together you and me could be so special, baby (It's you and me)

All the times You 2-Way me tellin' me that you miss me
Wantin' me to come over and keep you busy
Remember that?
Now that you gone, it's been kinda hard
Can't think, can't sleep
Can't do nothin' at all
Just tell me why you had to go back
See, you ain't have to go through that
My baby (You ain't have to go through that)
You could've been here right by my side
Me and you at the park takin' walks outside, but
Instead, I keep on havin' these dreams
Waiting for my phone to ring
My baby
Wishin' that it would be you
But I know that that won't come true
My baby (My baby, yeah)
Girl, I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's alright, aww baby (Say that I know that you're loyal to your man)
But that don't change the fact that you fight and you stay cryin' every night
Nah, baby
Girl, you gotta let him know
You can't live like this no more
Nah, baby (Girl, you are so special)
Can't ya see?
Together you and me could be so special, baby
(Said I understand, y'all)
Girl, I understand you loyal to ya man
And that's alright, aww baby (Loyal to your man)
But that don't change the fact that you fight and you stay cryin' every night (That don't change the fact)
Nah, baby (That you're fighting, no)
Girl, you gotta let him know
You can't live like this no more (Girl, you gotta let him know)
Nah, baby (Girl)
Can't ya see?
Together you and me could be so special, baby (Gotta let him know, yeah)
