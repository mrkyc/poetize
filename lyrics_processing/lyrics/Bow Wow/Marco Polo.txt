Never been fake cause all the girls love official
S.O.D cause girls love initials
I'm on another level, I'm in my zone
Black car, white rims, can they both get along?
This is not The Matrix, but I am the Oracle
Do you wanna get with me? The question is rhetorical
Say the same lines but the fans aren't bored of me
Seventy-five thousand dollars if you wanna order me
Hold on! Let me change my swag
My flow broadband, y'all boys still LAN
My whole clique straight, y'all whole clique fags
Last night, your girl forehead was on my abs

Gucci bandana (Check) Louie V leather (Check)
Keep on looking, there's no one better (Ay)
Air Force Ones mixed with the new Js (Check)
You can't catch me, I'm too far away

Bow makes the girls go crazy, they wanna be my lady
How many can I fit in my two-seater Mercedes?
Lime green Lambo, no roof, that's a drop top
Stop, they hating cause they girlfriends on my jock
I let her lick the rapper, let her lick the actor
The next Will Smith and I be ballin' like the Raptors
If you don't want no drama in the club then don't act up
How can I run out? My money longer than a tour bus, ay
