Drifting away into dreams of despair
Visions of doom and of dead eyes that stare
Will the end be what you thought, will you escape?
Across the plains you rode as you fled
The lord of chaos put a price on your head
And the black blade at your side won't let you rest

To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades

And in the end it's the steel versus steel
The final lock and final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and final key
Steel versus steel

Skin as white as the full moon at night
Eyes that burn like a red fire light
But the body's still as weak as a newborn child
Tried to rule with mercy inside
Ignore tradition and the dragons will rise
The dreaming city falls, lost in time
You might also like
To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades

'Cause in the end it's the steel versus steel
The final lock and final key
It's steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
It's steel versus steel
The final lock and final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need

To slay became a trade
You will travel on the seas of fate
The seas of fate, between the blades
The price to pay, the end of time

The final fate a clash between the blades

And in the end it's the steel versus steel
The final lock and final key
It's teel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
It's steel versus steel
The final lock and final key
It's steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
Won't tame the need
It's the steel versus steel
