We All-American, yeah
I said party over here, call up everybody we know
This is for the women who be feedin' off my ego
Tell 'em that I made it, 'cause I listen to my haters
Took what that said and negated, yeah I played it like I'm Tebow
Poor me out another one, take a shot and reload
Girls be waitin' for me, got 'em lining up like free throws
Everywhere that we go they say I'm their favorite
But I see that you've been fakin', baby I know how to make it
In America, doin' what we love and we passionate
Your girl is cashin' in, Kourtney Kardashian
You pulled up with some honey bees, and I pulled out with half of them
'Cause I ain't going home if I ain't going with the baddest chick

Thumbs up to my friends drinking whiskey
Peace out to the girls that will miss me
Middle finger to the dudes back in high school
'Cause you peaked at eighteen, cool, oh-ooh
'Cause you peaked at eighteen cool, oh-ooh
You make me look so good
You might also like
Nights be getting kind of cold and lonely on the interstate
You be pushing sixty-five and I be pushing sixty-eight
Just to stay ahead of you and prove that we the best, right?
Life is just a highway but homie, there's no test drive
Grab your girl and let's ride, take you where I'm supposed to be
'Cause I'll be back to Earth someday, and you'll be baggin' groceries
Or tryna sell insurance, but this right here a sure thing
You wake up with nothin' on your plate, oh you poor thing
'Cause I did what I want and I made my dreams reality
These bitches be cakin' off what I'm makin' like Sara Lee
Looking through my yearbook, said I would succeed quick
Throwin' out my salary, 'cause I don't ever need shit

Thumbs up to my friends drinking whiskey
Peace out to the girls that will miss me
Middle finger to the dudes back in high school
'Cause you peaked at eighteen, cool, oh-ooh
'Cause you peaked at eighteen cool, oh-ooh
You make me look so good

Four years, gone by
Look back and you're out of your prime
But the cool kids never gonna miss me
It's all history, it's all history
Four years, denied
Fuck that let's party tonight
But the cool kids never gonna miss me
Miss-miss-miss me, miss me
Thumbs up to my friends drinking whiskey
Peace out to the girls that will miss me
Middle finger to the dudes back in high school
'Cause you peaked at eighteen, cool, oh-ooh
'Cause you peaked at eighteen cool, oh-ooh
'Cause you peaked at eighteen cool
Thumbs up to my friends drinking whiskey
Peace out to the girls that will miss me
Middle finger to the dudes back in high school
'Cause you peaked at eighteen, cool, oh-ooh
'Cause you peaked at eighteen cool, oh-ooh
