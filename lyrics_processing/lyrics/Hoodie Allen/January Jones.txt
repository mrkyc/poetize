Uh, pardon my small talk, darlin' I'm all talk
They wanna fence me in, never a ballpark
We tear the wall off the Waldorf Astoria
I told my dudes to get to steppin' like Gloria
I made my case, she a slept-on jury
And when I go from deep I be like Stephen Curry
The lines'll hit you sharp, it got the teflon worried
So I told her that I cruise homes, yep like Suri
So I woke real early, grab a bagel and a glass of joe
The he-man, woman hater, I'm a Ras-a-cal
And Alfalfa, my hair stickin', it lost control
'Cause I'm a rapper, but she more into the classical
Uh, no need to apologize
I'm 21, but I been dreamin' 'bout the college life
So when she looks into her father's eyes, shouts to Eric Clapton
I'll be the director, 'cause I'm all about the action

You're so damn beautiful
My January Jones
Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back
From your head down to your toes
I want you all alone
Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back
You might also like
You say I'm spellbound, I hardly spell out
The four letters that make every girl just melt down
We on the shelf now, no Sam Goody
And when you mention other dudes, they no damn Hoodie
'Cause we go truly hard, stiles like Julia
And I been gifted since a youth like I'm at Julliard
When we were younger, you were cooler
You and your friends used to rule the yard
A moment flicked by, I wish I was McFly
Marty with the sick ride, I'm able to switch time
No second guessin' decisions on why I pick sides
So ex-nay, only talkin' 'bout my insides
Always up to somethin', so we annually home
This song is dedicated to my January Jones
And it's a Space Jam, they say that I'm Michael
Lovin' under twenty's a cycle, so here we go

You're so damn beautiful
My January Jones
Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back
From your head down to your toes
I want you all alone
Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back
And I come right back
Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back

I throw my hand out, I'm tryna help her up
She lookin' back at me, I think you helped enough
Ain't havin' none of it, you gonna sit and say
No love for triple A, okay she's gone away

You're so damn beautiful
My January Jones
Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back
From your head down to your toes
I want you all alone
Oh, you drive me mad
And I come right back

And I come right back
Oh, you drive me mad
