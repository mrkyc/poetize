I remember Lord, remember Lord
Come along

Was driving my fifty
I see no lines on my way
Nothing to say
Yes, I'm feeling guilty
Was on my high bar
I'm losing ground

Anyway, I'm setting up my own shame
Bring me back my old flame
Or I'll be long gone, love me world
Just not getting used to
All the things I push through
I feel unplugged, no more words

I was up ahead, no-one could've chased me
Going high speed, didn't feel that fame would change me
Facing old fears, am I gonna stay here?
Losing more sleep
Surely gonna die before I wake
I was up ahead, no-one could've chased me
Going high speed, didn't feel that fame would change me
What a lifetime, nothing lasts forever
All is gone now, should've seen it coming my way

I remember Lord, remember Lord
Come along

I see how much they miss me
Writing lines every day, nothing to say
Yes, I'm feeling guilty
I'm aiming so far, was feeling awesome

Anyway, I'm setting up my own shame
Bring me back my old flame
Or I'll be so gone, love me world
Even trying the voodoo
Seeing what I could do
Can't hold a flood, no more world

I was up ahead, no-one could've chased me
Going high speed, didn't feel that fame would change me
Facing old fears, am I gonna stay here?
Losing more sleep
Surely gonna die before I wake
I was up ahead, no-one could've chased me
Going high speed, didn't feel that fame would change me
What a lifetime, nothing lasts forever
All is gone now, should've seen it coming my way

Driving my fifty
I see no lines on my way
Nothing to say
Yes, I'm feeling guilty

I'm losing ground

Anyway, I'm setting up my own shame
Bring me back my old flame
Or I'll be long gone, love me world
Just not getting used to
All the things I push through
