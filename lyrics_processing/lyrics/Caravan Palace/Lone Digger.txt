Hey, brother, what you thinkin'? Leave that old record spinning
You feel the rhythm going (Wasn't gonna marry, til-uh)
Legs ain't got time to lay low, your knees are bending and so
It's time to get up and let go (Stick to the promise girl that)

Hey, mama, how's it going? Can't see your body moving
Don't leave the party dying (Wasn't gonna marry, til-uh)
Keep booty shaking, you know, your head has no right to say "No"
Tonight it's "Ready, set, go!"

Baby, can you move around the rhythm so we can get with 'em
Jump around, and get us a rock and roll 'round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, real slow, hell no
Baby, can you move around the rhythm, 'cause you know
We're living in the fast lane, speed up, it ain't no game
Just turn up all the beams, when I come up on the scene


Hey, brother, what you thinking? That good ol' sound is ringing
They don't know what they're missing (Wasn't gonna marry, til-uh)
Legs ain't got time to lay low, your knees are bending and so
It's time to get up and let go
