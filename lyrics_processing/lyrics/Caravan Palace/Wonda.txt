Way away from home and I didn't know what to do
So I grab the telephone, because I felt blue
It rang, and rang, and rang, it rang until it got dizzy
And then a deep, bass voice said, "Uh, hello?"

Stop ringing, 'cause I'm busy

And, "Who is you?" I wonder, "Who is you?"
I said, "This is Mr. Beau."
I said, "Who is you?" I wonder, "Who is you?"
He said, "This is Shorty Jones"

Get out of my house, get out of my house
Get out of my house, you mouse
Let the door hit you, where the dog bit you
Get out, no, Shorty's got to go
