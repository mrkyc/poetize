I'm thrilling, ooh, I'm thrilling in my world
I've been down so far, I'm now the highest star
It's seems unreal, but now my heart's on fire
Don't push me out to ride beyond

I don't like it (Don't you?)
So glad I don't like it (I do)
But, I don't care, I don't like it (You'll do)
No, I really don't like it (Fuck you)
I don't like it (Don't you?)
So glad I don't like it (I do)
But, I don't care, I don't like it (You'll do)
No, I really don't like it (Fuck you)

(Yes) Say it to your friend, tell it to the world
Distilled for real men, ready to be served
Aah, ah, ah, ah, ah, tell it to the world
I silence lot of fears, your dreams unfurl

I'm swaying, ooh, I'm swaying on the road
I've been high so far, I'm lost among the stars
It's still unreal and now I fight desire
Don't hack me with your siren song
