Can you feel the pain?
See the mess and trouble in your brain
Anger you retain, pressure rocks you like a hurricane
Is it time for you to jump into the next train?
Change of head, make a stand
I can see your heart change
Wake up!
No more nap, your turn is coming up
You feel lazy but stop the fantasies and bubble butts
If you need to hear, go for it
I will teach you how to feel the thing so close to you
Connect it all

(Act like a brother)
Every day is a miracle
(Help one another)
Connect back with the people
(Give it to your lover)
And all the people you miss
(Let's go already)
(Act like a brother)
Don't think you're invisible
(Help one another)
Connect back with the people
(Give it to your lover)
And all the people you miss
(Let's go already)
