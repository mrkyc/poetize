I hope you got hit by the boogie
They keep it all under my bed
Our mouth goes in, got the money, oh
Move it, move it all under my bed
Oh, my pops used to say I'm a chumpy
They keep it all under my bed
Them girls and I can't fight it
And it's something I can put in my bed

I hope you got hit by the boogie
But that was justified by the pay
Our mouth goes in, got the money, oh
Move it, move it all under my bed
I really hope you got hit by the boogie
That'd be the fee of my pay
Then it gets funny, do you feel me?
And it's, and it's something, and it's, and it's (Murder)
