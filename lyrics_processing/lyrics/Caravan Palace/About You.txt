Well, I'm a big girl with cash and wheels
I'm taller than you when I don't wear heels
And I don't give a damn, don't give a damn about
You'll never know how to deal with me
Big trouble inside when I hit the spot
I like to hang out, lay down my block
And I don't give a damn, don't give a damn about you

Still, will you let me, will you let me over?
'Cause your high heels take me higher
So your talk won't take me under
Now, can you give me one night to keep me over?
So I can take you higher
As the world goes up in fire

But I'm a tough girl, don't need anybody
Not a gold digger, not a sugar baby
I don't give a damn, don't give a damn about
You'll never know how to deal with me
Still wanna play the game, I won't be the loser
Everyone knows I would never choose ya
I don't give a damn, don't give a damn about you
Can't find a proper way to please me
