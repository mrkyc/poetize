I am happy to be alive
'Cause I know I could not be in a place that's filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights, while I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is all I know, how to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say, facing all this pain in my way

I fight it every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, "Okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way

Don't be so down, c'mon, young homie
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of
Don't be so down, c'mon, young homie
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of
You might also like
Now is the time to show what you're made of

I am happy to be alive
'Cause I know I could not be in a place so filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights, while I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is all I know, how to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say, done running from this pain in my way

I'm fighting every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, "Okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
