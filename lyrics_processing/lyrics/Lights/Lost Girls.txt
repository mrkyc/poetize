Roll the window all the way down
Leave the city in the background
Block the number that you're getting in
This fucking sunset is a specimen

Look up, look up, look up, look up, look up
No ceilings
You love, you love, you love, you love, you love
This feeling
Block the number that you're getting in
This god damn sunset is a specimen

Look at us now, atop a mad world
With a nose bleed, poppin' Advil
Look at us now, fuck the bastards
In your dad's truck, just a lost girl
Look at us now, atop a mad world
With a nose bleed, poppin' Advil
Look at us now, got your daughters
In your dad's truck, just the lost girls

Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls

Don't call me, I'm not looking for love tonight
Don't come up, I ain't tryna fuck, alright
I just wanna lay low, I already feel fine
I don't wanna get high
I just wanna sip a cheap wine

Look up, look up, look up, look up, look up
No ceilings
You love, you love, you love, you love, you love
This feeling
Roll the window all the way down
Leave the city in the background

Look at us now, atop a mad world
With a nose bleed, poppin' Advil
Look at us now, fuck the bastards
In your dad's truck, just a lost girl
Look at us now, atop a mad world
With a nose bleed, poppin' Advil
Look at us now, got your daughters
In your dad's truck, just the lost girls

Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls

Console gaming, crystal gazing
Friends are flaking, backyard blazing
Hula-hooping, ELO looping
All I want in this old life, are the things I
Are the things I like

Look at us now, atop a mad world
With a nose bleed, poppin' Advil
Look at us now, fuck the bastards
In your dad's truck, just the lost girls
Look at us now, atop a mad world
With a nose bleed, poppin' Advil
Look at us now, got your daughters
In your dad's truck, just the lost girls

Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls (lost girls)
Just the lost girls
Just the lost girls
