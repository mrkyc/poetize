Walk with me through the boneyard
I know you like to play hard
You know I'm easy to convince
How you move through the spaces and can get so persuasive
I haven't been home since

'Cause this full metal alchemy
Just brings up out the best in me each time
Ooh-ooh, and all these sacred memories that summon me are mine

You just keep me coming back
Something about how opposites attract
You hold me down
I'm in it for real
Love me, leave me high and dry
I'm back in your arms and I don't know why
I can't get around your magnetic field

Don't know if I believe you
And when I try to leave you
I can't turn around
You might also like
'Cause I can't keep my eyes away
Bad chemistry begs me to stay each time
Ooh-ooh, and all these sacred melodies that summon me are mine

You just keep me coming back
Something about how opposites attract
You hold me down
I'm in it for real
Love me, leave me high and dry
I'm back in your arms and I don't know why
I can't get around your magnetic field

If I leave I believe I could never settle
'Cause I'm drawn to your core like a precious metal
And you balance me out
If I leave I believe I could never settle
'Cause I'm drawn to your core like a precious metal
And you balance me out
And that I can't live without

Just keep me coming back
Something about our opposites attract
You hold me down
I'm in it for real
Love me, leave me high and dry
I'm back in your arms and I don't know why
I can't get around your magnetic field
You just keep me coming back
Something about our opposites attract
You hold me down
I'm in it for real
Love me, leave me high and dry
I'm back in your arms and I don't know why
