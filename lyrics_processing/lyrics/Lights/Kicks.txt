I don't really know what I'm headed for
I got a lot of problems, I ain't looking for more
I just wanna cruise
I just wanna cruise the wild with you
And I know, I know it goes against the grain
I don't want the money, I'm not playing the game
I just wanna lose
I just wanna lose myself with you

It's how we get our kicks, machete in the sticks
Lost in the thick of it with you
Ain't looking for a fix, nah, we're just winging it
It doesn't really matter what we do
'Cause not all who wander are looking for the exit
Sometimes a diamond is rough around the edges
It's how we get our kicks, machete in the sticks
Lost in the thick of it with you

It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
You might also like
'Cause I'm out of my head
I've been losing my grip
Been riding 'round town, shooting from the hip
Just making my way
Just throwing that caution to the breeze
Tell me 'bout the last time you got free
Laughed 'til your sides split, cut your knees
Do you wanna take?
Do you wanna take a trip with me?

It's how we get our kicks, machete in the sticks
Lost in the thick of it with you
Ain't looking for a fix, nah, we're just winging it
It doesn't really matter what we do
'Cause not all who wander are looking for the exit
Sometimes a diamond is rough around the edges
It's how we get our kicks, machete in the sticks
Lost in the thick of it with you

It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
What I'm after doesn't really matter
When I'm lost with you
What I'm after doesn't really matter
When I'm lost with you

It's how we get our kicks, machete in the sticks
Lost in the thick of it with you
Ain't looking for a fix, nah, we're just winging it
It doesn't really matter what we do

It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks

It's how we get our kicks
What I'm after doesn't really matter when I'm lost with you
It's how we get our kicks
What I'm after doesn't really matter when I'm lost with you
It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
It's how we get our kicks
