The night is deafening
When the silence is listening
And I'm down on my knees
And I know that something is missing
Because the back of my mind
Is holding things I'm relying in
But I choose to ignore it
Because I'm always denying them

I'm a bit of a manic
When it's not as I plan it
'Cause I start losing my head
And then I get up in a panic
Remember when we were kids
And always knew when to quit it?
Are we denying a crisis
Or are we scared of admitting it?

I don't want to know

I just want to run to you
And break off the chains
And throw them away
I just want to be so much
And shake off the dust
That turned me to rust
Sooner than later
I need a saviour
I need a saviour

It won't ever change
If you want it to stay the same
I really hate it, but I know
It's hard to choose if you're chained
And when it's all you control
'Cause you got nothing else to hold
You're getting tighter and tighter
It's getting harder to let it go

I don't want to know

I just want to run to you
And break off the chains
And throw them away
I just want to be so much
And shake off the dust
That turned me to rust
Sooner than later
I need a saviour
I need a saviour

Stand me up
And maybe I won't be so small
Free my hands and feet
And maybe I won't always fall
Save me

I just want to run to you
And break off the chains
And throw them away
I just want to be so much
And shake off the dust
That turned me to rust
I just want to run to you
And break off the chains
And throw them away
I just want to be so much
And shake off the dust
That turned me to rust

Sooner than later
I need a saviour
