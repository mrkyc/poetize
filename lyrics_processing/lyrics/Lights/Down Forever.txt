I wish I was more self aware
Maybe I'd take my own advice
Maybe I could make a wish
Without taking a risk
Of maybe not being right

But I'm the same kid, same mission
Same confidence condition
Most of the time I just close my eyes
And throw and go my decisions
And that's okay
That's okay sometimes

I keep pushing further
'Cause I know when I am here
It all gets better
Even if it's been a year
It don't stay down forever
Even when I'm lying here
I won't lay down forever
I won't lay down forever

What do you know about real pain?
Do I really deserve anything?
I never run the ship
I just circle around it
And pretend that I'm getting in
You might also like
But I'm a hard case to break in
I'm preaching day-out and day-in
Most of the time I don't even find
The words that I keep sayin'
And that's okay

I keep pushing further
'Cause I know when I am here
It all gets better
Even if it's been a year
It don't stay down forever
Even when I'm lying here
I won't lay down forever
I won't lay down forever
I won't lay down forever

Don't be so hard on yourself
I say to myself
Lying in the dark
Don't be so hard on yourself
I say to myself, lying
Don't be so hard on yourself
I say to myself
Lying in the dark
Don't be so hard on yourself
I say to myself
I keep pushing further
'Cause I know when I am here
It all gets better
Even if it's been a year
It don't stay down forever
Even when I'm lying here
I won't lay down forever
I won't lay down forever

I won't lay down
I won't lay down forever
I won't lay down
I won't lay down
