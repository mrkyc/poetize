I left my body
Down on her knees
Over the bedside
Watching you breathe
And I saw the fire
I felt the flames
I heard the banshees
Calling your name

'Cause I have these new fears
I carry with me
So you can feel stronger
And you can know peace

So just hold on tight
I'll be coming, I'm coming for you, oh-oh
And every night I'll be burning, burning for you, oh-oh
And I will back you up
I will show you love
I will give you all I got 'til I can not
Hold on tight
I'm breathing, breathing for you, oh-oh
You might also like
And when you come undone
I'll carry your chains
So you can feel freedom
And a little less pain
And if the poison
Burns in your blood
I'll drink the venom out of the cut

'Cause I have these new fears
That carry me through
Every bullet I'm taking for you

So just hold on tight
I'll be coming, I'm coming for you, oh-oh
And every night I'll be burning, burning for you, oh-oh
And I will back you up
I will show you love
I will give you all I got 'til I can not
Hold on tight
I'm breathing, breathing for you, oh-oh

I'll take two time the misery
And half the glory
If it meant you'd be the champion of the story
And I'll take two times the agony
And half the wonder
If it meant you'd get twice
Twice the thunder
Hold on tight (Hold on)
I'll be coming, I'm coming for you
(Oh), oh-oh, (Oh)
And every night I'll be burning
(Every night)
Burning for you
(Oh), oh-oh, (Oh)
And I will back you up
I will show you love
I will give you all I got 'til I can not
Hold on tight (Hold on)
I'm breathing, breathing for you
