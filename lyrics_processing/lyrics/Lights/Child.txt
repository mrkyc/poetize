What is this about?
Where is everybody going?
What am I doing here?
Can't separate what I really need to know and
What I just want to hear
Maybe I'm alone
Maybe everybody's lost too
Looking for a way out
Maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't even want to
Just don't want to be let down

There is no sureness, I kind of just stumble along
There must be purpose in trying to keep on

What do I know?
I'm a child
Just trying to talk like a mother does
Seeing life come and go all the time
It's never as long as you wish it was, oh-oh-oh
Maybe I'm still trying to see like a child does

And I always feel like I did when I was younger
Can't talk sense into me
How do you decide when to know or how to wonder
Or how to just get free?

There's no certainty, I kind of just stumble along
Doesn't bother me, I'm trying to keep on

What do I know?
I'm a child
Just trying to talk like a mother does
Seeing life come and go all the time
It's never as long as you wish it was, oh-oh-oh
Maybe I'm still trying to see like a child does

I've seen both sides of the door
I'm not a child anymore
But I can stand in it the way I did when I was a kid

What do I know?
I'm a child
Just trying to talk like a mother does
Seeing life come and go all the time
It's never as long as you wish it was

What do I know?
I'm a child
Just trying to talk like a mother does
Seeing life come and go all the time
It's never as long as you wish it was, oh-oh-oh
Maybe I'm still trying to see like a child does
