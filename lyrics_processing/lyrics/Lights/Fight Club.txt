It's feast or famine with you, isn't it?
You're either all the way in, or you up and quit
When we run out of walls to hit
We just walk away from it, walk away from it, walk away
What ever happened to talking it out?
Always keeping our thoughts locked in our mouths
And the silence always turns to shouts
'Til we forget what it's about, -get what it's about, it's about?

It's getting heavy, you already know
Crack in the levy is about to blow

Throw my hands up, 'cause I had enough
It's coming to a head, like it always does
Come and show me what you're made of
All that we sacrifice for love
Blowing up when push comes to shove
Gotta have it out like fight club
Fight club
Gotta have it out like fight club

And I love the way you think you're always right
But we never talk it out, we're just up all night
Let's take it out of the dark and into the light
'Cause I don't want the drama, I just want the fight
I just want the fight
You might also like
Throw my hands up, 'cause I had enough
It's coming to a head, like it always does
Come and show me what you're made of
All that we sacrifice for love
Blowing up when push comes to shove
Gotta have it out like fight club
Fight club
Gotta have it out like fight club
Fight club
Let's put it all behind us and make love
Fight club

It's getting heavy, you already know

Blowing up when push comes to shove
Gotta have it out like fight club
