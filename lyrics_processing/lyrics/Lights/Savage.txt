I was hangin' next to you by a thread from so high
We were heaven and the moon in the center of my eye

And I would shine on you
And I would kiss your crown
And then out of the blue
You would cut me down (Cut me down)

But when you hung up the phone and you blocked my number
I was alone in the rain and thunder
I shoulda known when you sent me under
I'm on my own and it made me wonder

What do you do when a man don't love you?
He takes the sun from the sky above you
How do you fix the damage?
How do you break the habit?
I never knew you could be so savage

(So savage)
I never knew you could be so...
You might also like
So just say it like you mean it
Won't you scream it out like it's religion?
You were the priest and the prophet
You were my scripture and my conviction

But when you hung up the phone and you blocked my number
I was alone in the rain and thunder
I shoulda known by the void I'm under
I'm on my own and it makes me wonder

What do you do when a man don't love you?
He takes the sun from the sky above you
How do you fix the damage?
How do you break the habit?
I never knew you could be so savage

(So savage)
I never knew you could be so savage (So savage)
(So savage)

Oh, in a flash flood of cruelty
You washed the ground out from under me
And oh, when you were through with me
I was swept away
What do you do when a man don't love you?
He takes the sun from the sky above you
How do you fix the damage?
How do you break the habit?
I never knew you could be so savage

You could be so savage
You could be so savage
(So savage)
