We were here

Rooftops, dirty thoughts
All I got is twenty bucks
Nights so breezy
Make it look easy
Knuckle cuts, pizza crust
Leave a message on the bus
Full moon howling
Let's go prowling
Spend some time, burn the money
Ah, we're gonna coast through shit we got into
I'm no good, not tryna be
Yeah, we got issues
Take a flag with you

Dressed up, messed up
Put on a show
So the whole damn world's gonna know...

That we were here (here, here, here)
Running 'round, pack of hounds
Young bloods burning it down
That we were here (here, here, here)
Setting flames, taking names, just 'cause we own the town
We're gonna ride in, solid as gold
We're gonna make it, so they gonna know
That we were here (here, here, here)
Yeah, we were here (here, here, here)
We were here

Photobooth, kissing youth
Midnight bulletproof
Night so hazy
Laid back, lazy
Slow burn, fighting words
Show them how the fire works
Make an impression
Teach 'em all a lesson

Dressed up, messed up
Put on a show
So the whole damn world's gonna know...

That we were here (here, here, here)
Running 'round, pack of hounds
Young bloods burning it down
That we were here (here, here, here)
Setting flames, taking names, just 'cause we own the town
We gonna ride it solid as gold
We're gonna make it, so they gonna know
