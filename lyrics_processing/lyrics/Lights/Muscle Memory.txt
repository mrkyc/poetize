After having spent a fast year
Waiting for the next time I can get you close
I grew used to being back here
Like a chorus and rhyme, soldier at his post
You call and I respond, the sparrow and the song
I miss you when you're gone

When I am alone, I see you in the dark
I talk into the empty like you were with me
Started on a cold night, felt you in the low light
Noticing a reflex taking over me
I see you and I reach
Muscle memory

Again, off into the next fall
I am on the back steps trying to let you in
See you standing in the front hall
Maybe this is madness underneath my skin
Guess love is a response of the body it haunts
And we do what it wants

When I am alone, I see you in the dark
I talk into the empty like you were with me
Started on a cold night, felt you in the low light
Noticing a reflex taking over me
I see you and I reach
Muscle memory
I feel you endlessly
Muscle memory
You might also like
When I feel the chains of a thousand words
And I speak your name like I know you heard
I can feel you there, I can hear you move
And it moves me too
When I'm playing games and I'm drinking wine
And I see your glass sitting next to mine
I can feel you there when you're not at home
Like I'm not alone

When I am alone, I see you in the dark
I talk into the empty like you were with me
Started on a cold night, felt you in the low light
Noticing a reflex taking over me
I see you and I reach
Muscle memory
I feel you endlessly
