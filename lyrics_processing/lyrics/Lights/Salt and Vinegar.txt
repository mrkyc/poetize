Bad decisions give me good things to think about
I just say "I don't know" out loud, over and over
Nothing like a pep talk to yourself
It works every time, it works every time

But there I go again lighting you up
I keep filling my cup
You'd think I'd had enough
There you go again bringing me down
But still I stick around
I kinda like it now

You're angry, I'm bitter
You and me make a dangerous mixture
Summoned the devil now we can't get rid of her
We go together like salt and vinegar
Salt and vinegar

I could do this all night
When you say it like that
With that look in your eye
Like you're tryna go off
It ain't nothing to suck your teeth at
'Cause when the guns come
They ain't coming to talk
You might also like
And there you go again working me up
I keep filling my cup
You'd think I'd had enough
There I go again bringing you down
'Cause if we're going down
It doesn't matter now

I'm a talker, you're not a listener
You hold back and I just keep givin'er
Kinda reminds me of when times were simpler
We go together like salt and vinegar
Salt and vinegar
Salt and vinegar

I can't help myself when I'm around you
I can't get enough, oh
I can't help myself when I'm around you
Don't hold me back, don't hold me back
Yeah, you're quick but I'm quicker
If you're a saint, then baby I'm a sinner

You're angry, I'm bitter
You and me make a dangerous mixture
Summoned the devil now we can't get rid of her
We go together like salt and vinegar
I'm a talker, you're not a listener
You hold back and I just keep givin'er
Kinda reminds me of when times were simpler
We go together like salt and vinegar
Salt and vinegar
Baby, I'm a sinner
Salt and vinegar
Salt
Salt
