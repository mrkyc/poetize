I know what you wanna say
You don't even gotta say it
Just 'cause it's a game, doesn't mean I gotta play it
Yes, I'm the real thing
Yes, I got class
I'll be taking the high road, fuckin' live and laugh last

I like to look pretty, but don't be fooled
I go for broke if I don't like the rule
You know I came up pop, but I ain't blowing bubbles
I'll tell you what I'm not, very good at being subtle

I'll be relaxing, stoking the coals
The world is collapsing, you're losing control
I'll be keeping tea hot, digging your pit
They say the future comes once and baby this is it

Oh she got claws
Fuck it, she got jaws
She got her guns out, boots up, no bras
Don't trust nobody
Baby, we're outlaws
Rebel with a cause
Oh, she got jaws
Oh, she got jaws
You might also like
You never wanna see it when it's under your nose
Everything is fine when you're keeping your eyes closed
I know you love to say "stay in your lane"
It makes you feel better when you're showing your fangs

But I'll be relaxing, stoking the coals
The world is collapsing, you're losing control
I'll be keeping the tea hot while you're taking the piss
They say the future only happens once and maybe this is it

Oh she got claws
Fuck it, she got jaws
She got her guns out, boots up, no bras
Don't trust nobody
Baby, we're outlaws
Rebel with a cause
Oh, she got jaws
Oh, she got jaws

I been looking for most of my life
A place to get high
A place to just ride
I've been looking for
Peace of my mind
Best of my time
I'll ride till I die
Oh she got claws
Fuck it, she got jaws
She got her guns out, boots up, no bras
Don't trust nobody
Baby, we're outlaws
Rebel with a cause
Oh, she got jaws
Oh, she got jaws
Oh, she got jaws (yeah yeah)
