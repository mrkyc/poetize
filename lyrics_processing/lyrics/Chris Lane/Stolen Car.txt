I never leave it sitting there all alone
It's like he doesn't know what he's got at home
I'm coming to pick you up even if it's wrong
Cause you're a deluxe custom body style

You make me wanna go too fast
Pedal heavy on the gas
Run away and never come back
I don't wanna ever get caught
Cause I don't wanna give you up
Let 'em come and lock me up

Your love is a stolen car
One look, one touch and I had to have it
I had to have it
He had you sitting in park
Like a thief in the night, I have to have it
I have to have you

I wanna rev you up, wanna hear you purr
Red line the night with every turn
Run my hands along your every curve
Cause you're a deluxe custom body style

Your love is a stolen car
One look, one touch and I had to have it
I had to have it
He had you sitting in park
Like a thief in the night, I have to have it
I have to have you

It's like he gave me his permission
To your red Ferrari lips
Leaving the keys in the ignition
How could I not just steal one kiss?

You make me wanna go too fast
Pedal heavy on the gas
Run away and never come back
I don't wanna ever get caught
Cause I don't wanna give you up

Like a thief in the night, I have to have it
I have to have you
