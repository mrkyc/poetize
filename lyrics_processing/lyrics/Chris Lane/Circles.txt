Standing here, drink it in, everything you've been pourin', like the way it goes down
And I like the taste on your tongue, I'm gonna let you hold me, even if it's just for now

I know where it's gonna go
You're so predictable

You always love me in circles
You hurt me on purpose
To come around again, come around again
You're so determined to break me
To say that you saved me
You come around again, come around again

I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
Swear I'll never leave you

Lyin' here next to you, I've never felt so perfect, even if it's just for now
With paper hearts and kerosene, one word can spark a fire, you build it up and burn it down
