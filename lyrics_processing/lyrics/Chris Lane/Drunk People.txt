She's wrapped in a blanket
Sunday morning
Hurting and working on a Pedialyte
Missed the church bell
Asking herself, "Girl what the hell you do last night?"
It was one text left to her ex's bed and clothes all over the place
She was summa cum laude, but at 1 am that wasn't the case

Drunk people do dumb things
They pick it up when the phone rings
Saying things that they don't mean
Like I want you back, the key's under the mat
Yeah, they forget about the heartbreak
Never thinking about the next day, til its too late
You can't take it back now
But it's ok, don't let it get you down

Considering drinking a bounce back beer
Saying why did I get drunk?

Now he's all torn up wishing she'd come back
He thought he was smarter than that but

Oh, drunk people do dumb things
Hey you up?
Yeah, what's up?
It's been a while, I miss you
I miss you too
Semi colon smile
What you doing right now, can I come meet you?
Drop me a pin, be there in ten
