You're the number one regret on my list
Number one bad taste on my lips
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number one

Ain't got nothing new I can sing about
Don't even matter who'd end up walking out
Things I can and do, things I can and say
There's your name right at the top of the page
You make me wanna pull you up on my stage
Put a gold medal 'round your neck and say

You're the number one regret on my list
Number one bad taste on my lips
Number one reason my heart broke
But I might be somehow worse than her, but I guess I'll never know
And, baby, you're the best
At making me a mess
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I ain't even sure who's the second place
If you got that far it don't matter anyway
Had to break a heart, had to leave a scar
Every sad song, baby, you're the star

You're the number one regret on my list
Number one bad taste on my lips
Number one reason my heart broke
But I might be somehow worse than her, but I guess I'll never know
And, baby, you're the best (Baby, you're the best)
At making me a mess (At making me a mess)
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

There's a lot of broken hearts
At the bottom of the charts
One by one, they dropping off
While you'd stay right on top

You're the number one regret on my list
Number one bad taste on my lips
Number one reason my heart broke
But I might be somehow worse than her, but I guess I'll never know
And, baby, you're the best (Baby, you're the best)
At making me a mess (At making me a mess)
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, number one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you're number one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, number one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
