You stole my heart, you tore my shirt
You sipped my drink, just smile and wink and it all works
And I pretend that I ain't hooked on you
But every time you walk away my night turns barlight blue
This ain't just a lie
You so dang fine

I want you so bad girl
Just look at you looking like that
How's an old boy like me supposed to act
Knocking me out the second you crash
Right into my world
Baby, my world started spinning
Like old school Waylon Jennings on vinyl, yeah
I go around and around since you came around
And this cool I playin' is just a bad act
I want you so bad girl
Yeah, bad girl

Just wanna shoot you straight
Don't wanna freak you out
Don't wanna kick myself when I get home
For not locking this down
This ain't no , it's straight tequila
For them feelings that I'm feeling
And them kisses I'll be stealing tonight

When you walk in the room
Baby, swaying the way that you do

I want you so bad girl
Just look at you looking like that
