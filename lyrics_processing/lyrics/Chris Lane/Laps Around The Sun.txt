Sun's settin' on the water now
Somehow you keep on gettin' hotter now
And I'm down with anyting that you down for
And I think you should know
You ain't ever gotta doubt it, babe
You already know that I'm about it, babe
Ain't ever goin' nowhere without you, lady
Don't be crazy

You already got my loving
And I ain't gonna stop for nothing, no
Gonna love each other 'til the sun goes down
And comes up again
While we're goin' 'round in circles
Let the ray turn purple
We'll be dancin', holdin', kissin', lovin'
Havin' ourselves some soaking wet fun
Don't you know we never be done
Taking laps around the sun?

I remember our fist date at the State Fair
I threw a ball and broke some bottles won a teddy bear
I took a break from cutting grass at the family business
To pick you up and meet you
Daddy said "No funny business"
When the pages kept turning in a little summer flame we made
The day just keeps on burning and I might just put a ring on it
Just to let you know that I, I love you like crazy

Havin' ourselves some soaking wet fun
Don't you know we never be done
Taking laps around the sun?

While we're up here you should just follow me
In our own little world, girl, that's gotta be
You make loving you so easy
You make loving you so fun
