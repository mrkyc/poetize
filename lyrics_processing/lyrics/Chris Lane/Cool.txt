Laying face first in an old box fan
Talking like Darth Vader
Nintendo, Tecmo Bowl
Bo Jackson, Oakland Raiders
Leather jacket with a glove on my hand
Moonwalking like Billy Jean
No, I wasn't tryna change the world
All I ever really wanted to be was

Cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be
Lost a little love, broke a few hearts
Lost a few nights shutting down bars
Lost a good fake ID or two
We never lost our cool
Lost friends and we lost touch
Got a little older, but we never grew up
There's a reason new school wants to be old school
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool

Yeah, so cool
(Everybody wants to be cool)
So dang cool

Good old boys in a hip-hop phase
808s and a hoopty, hoopty
Can't sever them southern roots
Way down yonder on the Chattahoochie
Played a little football, third string
Had to get the girls with the six string
Playing every song 'til your fingers bleed
Doing everything just tryna be

Cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be
Lost a little love, broke a few hearts
Lost a few nights shutting down bars
Lost a good fake ID or two
We never lost our cool
Lost friends and we lost touch
Got a little older, but we never grew up
There's a reason new school wants to be old school
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be

Cooler than the whip on the top of the pie
Cooler than the gang celebrating tonight
Kool Aid mustache, 4th of July
So dang cool, you don't have to try
You're just cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool
Yeah, we all wanna be
Cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be
We lost a little love, broke a few hearts
Lost a few nights shutting down bars
Lost a good fake ID or two
We never lost our cool
Lost friends and we lost touch
Got a little older, but we never grew up
There's a reason new school wants to be old school
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool

Yeah, so cool
(Everybody just wants to be cool)
