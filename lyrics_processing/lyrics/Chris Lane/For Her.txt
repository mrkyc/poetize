She got a smile that makes your worst day
Feel like it's your birthday
She's got a laugh like confetti
Would change her name if she'd let me

She's got a way of changing the game
The way that you play, it's never the same

She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio (She's the kind that makes you wanna)
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call
She make you wanna die for her

The way that she moves
Is like a soft glow, flicker of a candle
She turns my cool into disaster
Heart is pumpin' faster
