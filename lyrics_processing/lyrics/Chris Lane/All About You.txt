It ain't a secret you've been stealing my attention
So tell me every little secret I don't already know
Sometimes it feels like I don't know enough about you, but I want to
You make me want to

Get emotional
Make it personal
Tell me everything you ever wanted me to know

Every up, every down, every side of you
All of the good, all of the bad, all of the hurting you've been through
Anything and everything you ever dreamed your whole life
'Cause girl I just know I wanna know all about you
'Cause I'm all about you

I wanna know how much your daddy loved your mama
You're what it means to keep a promise when you're sayin' "I do"
I ain't tryna get ahead of myself, but I want to
You make want to

Get emotional
Make it personal
Tell me everything you ever wanted me to know
