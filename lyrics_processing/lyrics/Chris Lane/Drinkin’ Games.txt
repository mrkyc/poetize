I can already see it coming
The way you're two drinks in and
You're spinning 'round on the floor
I ain't sure what you're sipping
But I'm sure you're sipping something
And that'll get you rolling the dice
To see if I'm still young
'Cause when it starts rolling off your lips
Baby I'm all in

You say it all when you say that you miss me
Say my name when you lean in to kiss me
You play it off and blame it on the whiskey
'cause you're feeling all tipsy
It's game over when you cross that line
I lose every time
When you start drinking, that's when you get to
Thinking of swinging right back into my arms
Girl, I can't shake it, no, I can't take it when you start playing
Drinkin' games with my heart

You pull my shirt and you get a little closer
With the buzz in your eyes and the smell of lies
On your breath. Girl, you and I know you would never do
It sober, but all it takes is one too many for you to forget
And even though I never win, baby here we go again

Well you can tell that I'm a little bit lonely
I know myself, and I'm giving in slowly
You pour it strong, sip it all night long
Then you get what you want and you're gone in the morning
Well you can tell that I'm a little bit lonely
I know myself, and I'm giving in slowly
You pour it strong, sip it all night long
