She only wants me on the weekend
Why do I want it all the time?
I even see you when I'm sleeping
The only thing that's on my mind

I've been spending my money and spending on mind (I, I)
I been cool with your friends; I remembered your sign (I, I)
But she only wants me on the weekend
And why do I want it...

Why do I want it all the time? (I, I, I)
Why do I want it all the time? (I, I, I)
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying (I, I, I)
You know I want it all the, you know I want it all the time

When you're shaking that, shake it all over, baby
You got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it

I give my love and she just takes it
No, she don't even need to ask (Oh)
Don't give it back, she don't replace it
Looking at that, I can't be mad (Oh)
