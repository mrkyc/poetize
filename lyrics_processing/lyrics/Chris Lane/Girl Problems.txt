Girl problems: yeah, they're bad and I've had my fair share from back in the day
Girl problems: some drama, some wanting a diamond after just one day
You saw me coming
All hours of stalking and watching my every move
Girl problems: I've dealt with some crazy, but baby, that was all before you

'Cause now I'm up too late at night
You're turning on everything but the light
Gotta go work, but I don't wanna go
Which part of you do I love best?
How do I keep kissing you and catch my breath?
Yeah, now with you, I got a whole new set
New set of girl problems

(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)

Girl problems: you know since I met you I can't think of anything else
Girl problems: do I take you downtown or keep you here all to myself?
I'm spending all my money, my time, every minute and dime I got
Girl problems: I'm in love with you baby and I don't ever wanna stop
