Quick stop at the quick sack
Six in on a 12-pack
Way too many people in the back
Hey girl, I guess you gotta sit on my lap, oh well
Climb through the barbed wire
Light something on fire
And just watch me get higher
Yeah, gonna be another all-nighter

Yeah, we're just living, living
Doing a little sipping, sipping
Seeing who's kissing on who
Yeah, take off running when the lights turn blue

Might call it crazy
Call it young and dumb and dangerous
They can call the cops on us
Call it never growing up
Call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Said ain't nothing but another Saturday night

Find a place where we all park
Drop a tailgate and make a bar
Drop the jolly rancher in the jar
'Til there's a halo around the stars, uh huh
All the girls wanna skinny dip
They shimmy them shorts off of their hips
Somebody got a busted lip
Tryna do a rope swing cannonball flip, yep

We're getting rowdy, rowdy
When your head gets cloudy, cloudy
Hey baby, how 'bout we see
Just how loud we can be

Might call it crazy
Call it young and dumb and dangerous
They can call the cops on us
Call it never growing up
Call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Said ain't nothing but another Saturday night
And just another day
And in the summertime, it's every other day
Hey baby, do I make you wanna say ooh
When you're restless and you're thirsty
You can act like it's your birthday
Yeah, we do it right, yeah, we do it right
Out here, don't you know that a Saturday night

Gets crazy
It gets young and dumb and dangerous
Let 'em call the cops on us
They can call it never growing up
They call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Said ain't nothing but another Saturday night
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
