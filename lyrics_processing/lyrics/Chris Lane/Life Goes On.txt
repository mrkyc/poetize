I don't know what to do with myself
Friday night, there's a handle on the shelf
I could use a hand, I could use some help
Lord, knows I've been going through hell
Might step outside, catch a breath of fresh air
Or I might just drop to the middle of nowhere
Do a little soul-searching, little moonlight churching

'Cause my world's gone numb and I just wanna feel something
Running low on hope and I don't know if I can overcome it

I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long
They say the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
How life goes on

Used to be on a Friday night
Baby, you and me be under neon lights
Smell the smoke all over our clothes
We hang around till the whole town closed
Now every bar I pass makes my heart head South
Every drink I have leaves a bad taste in my mouth
And baby that's why

Just been wondering all night long
They say the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
How life goes on
Come on!
Tell me life goes on

Baby, how do you make leaving me look so easy?
Yeah, I'm trying so hard but I'm so far from believing
That life goes on
Yeah, life goes on

I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long
They say the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
How life goes on
'Cause I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long, yeah
Yes, and the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
Yeah, life goes on
Tell me life goes on
