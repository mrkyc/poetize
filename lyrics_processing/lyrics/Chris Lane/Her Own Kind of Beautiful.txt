Ball-cap to the flip-flop
A toe ring to the tip-top
From Haggard to the hip-hop
She can play either side of a bad cop good cop
From her sundress to her Sunday best
Cover Girl top or just a hot mess
Oh my my, yeah she's the girl that got my heart beating outta my chest

She's a blue-jean, rope swing, supermodel
Like a stain-glass made from a broken bottle
Make you promise you won't when she knows you gotta
Yeah, she's her own kind of beautiful
She's a Roman candle, she's a tent revival
She's a needle dancing on classic vinyl
She's a sunset wish with a can't miss smile
Her own kind of beautiful
Beautiful

A hello, yeah just clicked
So she, settled in for a slow sip
And when we leave in a little bit
All the other guys, will be so pissed
