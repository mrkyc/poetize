Way to go, girl, you made it out of this town
You didn't know if you could, I didn't have any doubts
You'd hit the road, girl, you've been doin' your thing
Where it runs a little quicker than these old two lanes
I shoulda known, girl, you'd be crushin' it, lovin' it on your own, girl
Yeah, way to go, girl, but

I still got your kiss in my whiskey
I still got your ghost in my shotgun seat
Still kinda hope that you miss me
I'm still a hundred tabs from back on my feet
Still tryna shake your memory
And not tap the brakes on Tenth Street
'Cause I wish you were home
Yeah, I'm movin' it on
But I still got a long way to go, girl

I heard you're back in the game
Found a guy with my eyes, just a little less twang
Wish that I could say that I was on the same page
But I'm just sittin' here, sippin' a little same old same, and

I still got your kiss in my whiskey
I still got your ghost in my shotgun seat
Still kinda hope that you miss me
I'm still a hundred tabs from back on my feet
Still tryna shake your memory
And not tap the brakes on Tenth Street
'Cause I wish you were home
Yeah, I'm movin' it on
But I still got a long way to go, girl
