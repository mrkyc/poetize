Five hundred horses outside at the valet
I got the keys, if you want, we can leave here tonight
24/7, your body's on my brain
But it don't mean ish if somebody else is on your mind

'Cause I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know when I'm touchin' on you
That you know, yeah, you know, yeah, you know what you're gettin' into
I don't care what he does 'cause he's only wastin' his time
And I know what you like, what you like

Who's it gonna be?
Baby, is it him or me?
We could fix this easily
If you just follow me home now
Who's it gonna be? (Who)
'Cause you know he can't compete (Can't compete now)
I'm the only one you need (Who)
You should probably let him know now
Who's it gonna be?

It's paradise when I'm touchin' your body
Put my hands on your waist, we can keep makin' waves if you want
You should be mine 'cause you just ain't anybody
Take it or leave it, but I'll never leave you alone

So who's it gonna be?
Baby, is it him or me?
We could fix this easily
If you just follow me home now
Who's it gonna be? (Who)
