Just when I got my groove on
I got my smooth on
I finally moved on from you, girl
I was on a rebound rocket
Then I felt a little buzzing in my pocket
Guess who?
I shoulda known it was you
I guess you already dropped your new somebody new
And you've had one or two and I'm back on your list
Well, all I gotta say is 'new phone, who's this?'

Yeah, you kicked me to the curb
You took my favourite shirt
Now you've got the nerve, girl
To blow me up like I'm 911
With the 'Where you at? What you doing? What's up?', yeah
Girl, you're kidding me, you're killing me
You're messing up my buzz
'Cause you keep texting that you're missing what we was
You want my love, you want my kiss
All I gotta say is 'new phone, who's this?'

Bet you thought I'd hit you back
With 'girl, I miss you bad'
Well, too bad
Hey, I don't want what we had
When I got what I got
She's so dang hot
Dot, dot, dot
