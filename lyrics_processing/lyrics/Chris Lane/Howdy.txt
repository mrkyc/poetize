Howdy, miss
That old two-finger pour is lookin' thin
I'd love to fill it to the top again
And barstool get to know ya a little better
Don't mean to pry
But I overheard you say he said goodbye
And I thought that maybe I could be the guy
To clear that mind of yours
If you want, I reckon we can turn this

"Howdy" into "How you doin'?"
Into "How about me and you do-si-do around this
Room until we're spinnin' circles like a record?"
Two-steppin' our way right into somethin' better
How'd he ever let you go? How'd he ever walk away?
He must've gone and hopped on a crazy train
How'd he ever let himself let another old John Wayne
Come up and cowboy say
"Howdy"
Baby, howdy
Baby, howdy

Pardon me
Never even asked you your name
I guess I got carried away
In the way you're sittin' pretty, smilin' picture perfect
Like I ain't the only one that's wantin' to work this

I wanna turn a whiskey sip into a whiskey kiss
Turn my Chevrolet into what you're gettin' in
Ain't thought it out, no, I ain't made a plan
Just Johnnie walkin' over, girl, to see if I can turn

"Howdy" into "How you doin'?"
Into "How about me and you do-si-do around this
