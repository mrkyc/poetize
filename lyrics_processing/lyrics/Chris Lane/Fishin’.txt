Girl let me throw this out there
I want to take you out where
We can get a little fresh air
Pop a top, share a spot
On a lawn chair
Honeysuckle in your long hair
Girl I swear I can hear them crickets cricking
While them lines are getting twisted
And the sun is slowly sinking like a bobber tonight

And when they ask us where we're heading
We'll say somewhere where they're biting
Little secret spot hiding
When them lighting bugs are bugging
Catch a buzz and catch a feeling
Just reeling you in
Stealing kisses, just go missing
When they ask where we've been
We'll call it fishin'
We'll call it fishin'

Get a little off the radar
Break out my old guitar
Popcorn in a mason jar
I take a sip, make a wish
On a shooting star
Girl you got me hooked, lined, and sinking

We'll say somewhere where they're biting
Little secret spot hiding
When them lighting bugs are bugging
Catch a buzz and catch a feeling
Just reeling you in
Stealing kisses, just go missing
When they ask where we've been
We'll call it fishin'
We'll call it fishin'

Watch your pretty little painted up toes
Disappear in the water
Baby don't you love it out here
Let's stay a little longer
A little longer
Baby we'll be goners

And when they ask us where we're heading
We'll say somewhere where they're biting
Little secret spot hiding
When them lighting bugs are bugging
Catch a buzz and catch a feeling
Just reeling you in
Stealing kisses, just go missing
When they ask where we've been
We'll call it fishin'
Yeah, yeah
We'll call it fishin'
Yeah, We'll call it fishin'
Yeah, yeah
