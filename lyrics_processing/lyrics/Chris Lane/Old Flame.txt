Look at us waking up in last night's clothes
Smelling like last night's smoke
Laughing at last night's jokes
Man, last night was dope
Went from flirting right back to burning
It feels real good learning

Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like
(Ooh ooh) baby in the pouring rain
(Ooh ooh) middle of a hurricane
Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night
Nothing lights like an old flame
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)

The off is all the way back to ten
We ain't gotta tell our friends
Thanks to that salty rim
Back in that groove again
Shouldn't be surprising
They could see the smoke signals rising

Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like
(Ooh ooh) baby in the pouring rain
(Ooh ooh) middle of a hurricane
Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night
Nothing lights like an old flame
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)

Yeah, it all started with tequila on your lips
Yeah, it ends up with you and me like this

Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like
(Ooh ooh) baby in the pouring rain
(Ooh ooh) middle of a hurricane
Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night
Nothing lights like an old flame
