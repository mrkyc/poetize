Some guys need a side piece
Some slide in the DM on the weekend
Some keep a couple on the line
Anytime they want another bed to sleep in
Girl, believe it

Oh, but me
I'm just a simple man
I'm just a dinner-for-two, true gentleman
Yes ma'am
I, I ain't no numbers man
Ain't trying to rack 'em up
Count 'em up on both hands

All I need is one girl, one girl
A fun girl, can't wait to come undone girl
Hotter than the sun girl, one girl
Second to none girl
No one else does what you do to me
I'm looking at you like you could be the one girl, one girl
All I need is one girl, one girl

To take a drive on the highway
Catch a sunset or a sunrise, whatever you like
Maybe stay in bed all day
Yeah I know it's a king size
But there's only room for one girl
You're the one girl, one girl

Yeah that's the thing about you and me, you and me
We fit together like a lock and key, perfectly, certainly
I'm thinking that eternity is there in the cards
It's written with a Sharpie baby up in them stars
Yeah all I need is one girl
Yeah all I need is one girl

All I need is one girl, one girl
A fun girl, can't wait to come undone girl
Put you on rerun girl, one girl
Second to none girl
No one else does what you do to me
I'm looking at you like you could be the one girl, one girl
All I need is one girl, one girl
