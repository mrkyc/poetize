I'm a dreamer
Don't tell me not to dream
I got freedom
And that's everything to me
It don't matter
What I've got or where I go
I'll find shelter a million miles from home
It ain't easy to keep going when it's hard
Keep shining in the dark
When you wanna fall apart
But I'm a dreamer
So don't tell me not to dream
I'm a believer

As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in

I'm a lover
Don't tell me who to love
I'm a runner
'Cause I've got somewhere to run
I just listen to the voices in my head
When they tell me
I'll always have something to believe in
