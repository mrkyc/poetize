You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart

Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
We'll comfort you for sure
If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are
I'll run to your front door

When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
