Better get some gasoline
I'm tearin' up the pictures
In our book of memories
And gather 'em up
Into a pile on the floor
We don't need them anymore
The floor in this house
Has been soaked through with tears
But that won't matter
When the fire starts spreading here
It won't be long
Till it all goes up in smoke
Till the sparks grab a hold
Let it all burn, bring it all down
Watch it all go up in flames
Let it give out, let it cave in
Let it bring down everything
Let it rise up till this love
Is nothing more than
Ashes on the ground
Oh, burn it down
You might also likeI'm tossin' in the laughter
And the smiles we knew before
I'm tossin' in the secrets
That you carin' through our door
And all those nights
That you looked me in the eye
And told me that you loved me
In our bed of lies
Let it all burn, bring it all down
Watch it all go up in flames
Let it give out, let it cave in
Let it bring down everything
Let it rise up till this love
Is nothing more than
Ashes on the ground
Oh, burn it down
You think you know what love can be
'Til you find you don't know anything
You just pour out your heart so there's nothing left to say
Then you strike that match and you walk away
Let it rise up till this love
Is nothing more than
Ashes on the ground
Let it all burn, bring it all down
Watch it all go up in flames
Let it give out, let it cave in
Let it bring down everything
Let it rise up 'til this love
Is nothing more than
Ashes on the ground
Oh, burn it down, oh, burn it down
