I could already taste the trouble in his eyes
My first shot of whiskey ever
And his first one of the night, ooh
Covered every road just sitting in his car
He told me I was pretty and he liked my scar
And he asked me, why I painted my fingernails black
And he turned me on like a radio song
We were gone and never coming back
I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same since
I never knew the way
Everything would change with one kiss
I haven't been the same since
In the heat of summer we were burnin' up wild
But the cure came creepin' in after a while
And the violent screams and silent games
That we both loved to play
Your foolish pride, my wounded side
Made it easy to walk away
I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same since
After runnin' through the rain
Try to hold onto the flame
But nothing coulda saved it
You might also likeTell me are you broken
Like a dog that you left hopin'
Like the truth won't give hope any light
Tell me if you feel goodbye
It's like a cut that just won't heal the night
Like a real bad dream that kills you inside
Haven't been the same since, ooh
I haven't been the same since, no
I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same since
Now when I hear your name
My hurt was worth the pain
I wanna feel it all again
Cause I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same
No I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same
I haven't been the same since
I haven't been the same since
Like a cut that just won't heal the night
