Puttin to much time to that old truck
It's running just fine, it's all a waste of time
You got something better you could pick up
Its Friday night baby get it in gear, i wanna rock it night not just kick it round here
It's a good night been a good year, give me the gas and i'll let you steer
Drop me into third baby say the word, we'll hit the blacktop jumpin through the red lights kissin'
Put me into second, boy im gonna let ya heat me right up till you reave my engine
Push me into fifth love the way you shift my whole world tips till my knuckles go white
Kick it into overdrive make me feel alive
Hey, come on come on
Baby we can roll all night
Baby we can roll all night
Boy we got a situation
A little temptation no one else out here on this open road
Just the moonlight a couple fireflies
Baby hold on tight and just let it go
Lets burn it up, put the pedal down, no one will hear if it gets to loud
Drop me into third, baby say the word we'll hit the blacktop jumping through red lights kissin'
Put me into second, boy im gonna let you heat me right up till you reave my engine
Push me into fifth love the way you shift my whole world tips till my knuckles go white
Kick it into overdrive make me feel alive
Hey, come on come on
Baby we can roll all night
We can roll all night, baby we can roll all night
It's a good night to spend the good year, give me the gas and i'll let you steer
Yeah
Baby we can roll all night
Drop me into third, baby say the word we'll hit the blacktop jumpin through the red lights kissin'
Put me in the second, boy im gonna let you heat me right up till you reave my engine
Push me into fifth love the way you shift my whole world till my knuckles go white
Kick it into overdrive make me feel alive
Hey, come on come on
Baby we can roll all night
We can roll all night, we can roll all night, baby we can roll all night
We got the moon light drippin' like honey
The fireflies dancin' while we roll all night
We can roll all night
Yeah, we got the moonlight drippin' like the honey
Got the fireflies dancin' while we roll all night
We can roll all night
