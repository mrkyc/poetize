I can go out, know how to hit the town
Drink all night, still be in my right mind
I can stay in every now and then
Sippin' in my bed on a bottle of red
I can have a good time and still be good to go
But when you come around, I lose all control

'Cause I'm a lightweight, messed up in a minute
Can't think straight, heart gets to spinnin'
Like I had a few too many and I couldn't stop
You're smoother than whiskey when it's on the rocks
I hate how you're such a habit that I can't break
But boy, I gotta have it
You instantly intoxicate, all it takes is just a taste
Can't lie, can't lie, I'm a lightweight

I love wakin' up still feeling kinda drunk
On that last kiss you left here on my lips
Couldn't walk a straight line with you on my breath
Might be over the limit but I haven't had enough yet

I'm a lightweight, messed up in a minute
Can't think straight, heart gets to spinnin'
Like I had a few too many and I couldn't stop
You're smoother than whiskey when it's on the rocks
I hate how you're such a habit that I can't break
But boy, I gotta have it
You instantly intoxicate, all it takes is just a taste
Can't lie, can't lie, I'm a lightweight
I'm a lightweight
You might also like
Baby, you know how to hurt me just the right way
What can I say?

I'm a lightweight, messed up in a minute
Can't think straight, 'cause my heart gets to spinnin'
Like I had too many and I couldn't stop (Couldn't stop)
You're smoother than whiskey when it's on the rocks
I hate how you're such a habit that I can't break
But boy, I gotta have it
You instantly intoxicate, all it takes is just a taste
Can't lie, can't lie, I'm a lightweight
I'm a lightweight
