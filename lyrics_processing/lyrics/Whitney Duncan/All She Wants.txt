Where my girls at? Haha
Come on, woo
Hey, hey

She's been clocking in at six
Working for tips at that little cafe on the corner
Yeah, she swears she's gonna quit
Soon as she gets enough money to move her somewhere warmer
She's been wound up tight for too damn long
Now tonight's her night to tie one on

All she wants to do
Yeah, all she wants to do
Is do a little dance with her hair down
And no trouble on her mind, no care now
Wants to be the one
Hangin', having fun
Ain't looking for a new somebody
Just here to be a part of the party
Got her going out boots
Gonna have her a few
Let go and cut loose
That's all she wants to do
(That's all she wants to, that's all she wants to do)
