That I ever
Saw your face
I felt something
Stop me in my place
The kinda thing
That you
Just can't see
Coming your way
I closed my eyes
And I jumped right in
Zero to sixty
And to the win
With my head held high
Like it was
Never coming home
And I trusted you
When you asked me to
When I said I would
Tell me
What was I thinking
I gave my heart
Without even blinking
That's all you got?
Well baby
That's just no good
(Whoa)
Don't give me that lie
You know I won't buy it
You're as good at love
As you are at lying
You said "uh-huh"
But I just don't think
You understood
When I said I would
You might also likeI stood by you
Played by the rules
For a second I thought
That you did too
Makes me wonder
How long you
Would have let me
Be a fool
I gave it my best
This is what I get
When I said I would
Tell me
What was I thinking
I gave my heart
Without even blinking
That's all you got?
Well, baby
That's just no good
(Whoa)
Don't give me that lie
You know I won't buy it
You're as good at love
As you are at lying
You said "uh-huh"
But I just don't think
You understood
When I said I would
Uuuuuhhhhh
When I said I would
I'm taking back
(When I said
I would love you)
I'm taking back
(Every kiss
That I gave you)
I'm taking back
(Every promise
I made you)
I'm taking back
Everything
That I said
When I said I would
Tell me
What was I thinking
I gave my heart
Without even blinking
That's all you got?
Well, baby
That's just no good
(Whoa)
Don't give me that lie
You know I won't buy it
You're as good at love
As you are at lying
You said "Uh-huh"
But I just don't think
You understood
When I said I would
When I said I would
(Whoa)
Don't give me that lie
You know I won't buy it
You're as good at love
As you are at lying
You said "Uh-huh"
But I just don't think
You understood
When I said I would
