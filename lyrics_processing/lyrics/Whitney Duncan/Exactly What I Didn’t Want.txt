So safe and secure
Being on my own
Independent and so sure
Didn't need nobody
To complicate my life
And like a bolt out of the blue
You caught my eye
And that's exactly what I didn't want to happen
One look was all it took
And that was it
Yeah
You came along
With a love so strong
My heart didn't stand a chance
When ya flashed that
Comin' over her to get me
"Gotta have you" grin
And that's exactly what I
Didn't want to happen
But I'm glad it did
Yeah, I used to stay home
Watch TV by myself
Didn't have to share
My Ben and Jerry's
With anybody else
I used to find
Peace of Mind
In my solitude
And now I'm going crazy
Every minute without you

Didn't want to happen
But you and me
Had to be a perfect fit
Yeah, right from the get-go
I couldn't let go
When ya held me tight
It felt so right
That I said I want some more
Of this
And that's exactly what I
Didn't want to happen
But I'm glad it did
I wasn't livin' til I found your love
I didn't know that what I really
Needed was
Exactly what I didn't want to happen
One look was all it took
And that was it
Yeah

With a love so strong
My heart didn't stand a chance
