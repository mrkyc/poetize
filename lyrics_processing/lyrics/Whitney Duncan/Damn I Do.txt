Another Friday night and
Same old drinks from somewhere new
But you wouldn't lie
Somewhere you never walk into

So I start throwin' 'em back
Say I'm done with lookin' back
Don't wanna be worryin' 'bout where you're at

'Cause I don't wanna, wanna want you to come over
I don't wanna, wanna wake up on your shoulder
Don't wanna want you to want me to
Find a way to just walk away from you
Shouldn't wanna want you to call
Wanna kiss you up and down the hall
Shouldn't even want you at all
But damn, I do
Damn, I do

Thought I'd be okay
Thought if I saw you, I could turn you down
'Til I saw your face
Lookin' at me the way you're lookin' right now
You might also like
So we start throwin' 'em back
And it starts takin' me back
Why you gotta make me feel like that?
Oh woah

I don't wanna, wanna want you to come over
I don't wanna, wanna wake up on your shoulder
Don't wanna want you to want me to
Find a way to just walk away from you
Shouldn't wanna want you to call
Wanna kiss you up and down the hall
Shouldn't even want you at all
But damn, I do
Damn, I do, yeah

I don't wanna, wanna want you to come over
I don't wanna, wanna wake up on your shoulder
I don't wanna, wanna want you to come over
I don't wanna, wanna wake up on your shoulder
Don't wanna want you to want me to
Find a way to just walk away from you
Shouldn't wanna want you to call
Wanna kiss you up and down the hall
Shouldn't even want you at all
But damn, I do
But damn, I do, woah
(I don't wanna, wanna want you to come over)
