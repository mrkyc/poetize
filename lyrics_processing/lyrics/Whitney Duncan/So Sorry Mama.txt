Ripped jeans, a blue eyes
I knew right away I was in trouble that night
Tattoos, he don't shave
Makes a good little girl wanna misbehave
I won't be takin' him a-home any time soon
It ain't a good move, woah
I keep givin' him my permission
To break me down and steal my kisses
I don't know where I went wrong
I'm sorry, mama, so sorry, mama
In so many ways I dare not mention
He keeps pullin' me in his direction
I guess you were right all along
I'm sorry, mama, so sorry, mama
Chrome hearts, a steal chains
And nothing but you know what on his brain
Full speed, top down
Like Bonnie and Clyde tearing up this town
I know you raised my better than this
But how can I resist? Woah
You might also likeI keep givin' him my permission
To break me down and steal my kisses
I don't know where I went wrong
I'm sorry, mama, so sorry, mama
In so many ways I dare not mention
He keeps pullin' me in his direction
I guess you were right all along
I'm sorry, mama, so sorry, mama
He's got this hold on me
Just like you said it would be
I didn't listen and now I can't walk away
I won't be takin' him a home any time soon
It ain't a good move, woah, woah
I keep givin' him my permission
To break me down and steal my kisses
I don't know where I went wrong
I'm sorry, mama, so sorry, mama
In so many ways I dare not mention
He keeps pullin' me in his direction
I guess you were right all along
I'm sorry, mama, so sorry, mama
I'm sorry, mama, so sorry, mama
I'm sorry, mama, so sorry, mama
