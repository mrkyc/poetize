Moonlight
Old-flame shine in your eyes
Pourin' sugar on the same old lies
I just want another sip of that wine
And fall right back into that spell
You know the one you keep me under so well
The one that gets me tellin' myself
One kiss ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Sure wanna lean in right now

But I'm thinkin' 'bout tomorrow girl
Sayin', "Why'd you do it, girl?"
Lookin' in a mirror, lyin' to myself
Wonderin', "Was it worth it, girl?
Where'd it get you, girl?
Was midnight heaven worth wakin' up in hell?"
Yeah, I'm thinkin' 'bout your boots walkin' out the door
Tonight, I gotta choose who I'm lookin' out for
And I'm thinkin' 'bout tomorrow girl

My heart
It could probably take another hit
Hear a "goodbye" leavin' your lips
Wanna wrap around your fingertips
It's just one more, one more time
And this might be the one where you stay
But deep down, I know you'll never really change
That's why I gotta walk away
You might also like
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout tomorrow girl
Sayin', "Why'd you do it, girl?"
Lookin' in a mirror, lyin' to myself
Wonderin', "Was it worth it, girl?
Where'd it get you, girl?
Was midnight heaven worth wakin' up in hell?"
Yeah, I'm thinkin' 'bout your boots walkin' out the door
Tonight, I gotta choose who I'm lookin' out for
And I'm thinkin' 'bout tomorrow girl

The one I'm so quick to ignore
Every time you roll in like a storm
The one I should've thought about before

Now I'm thinkin' 'bout tomorrow girl
Sayin', "Yeah, you did it, girl"
Lookin' in a mirror, proud of myself
Not sayin', "Was it worth it, girl?
Where'd it get you, girl?
Was midnight heaven worth wakin' up in hell?"
Yeah, I'm not worried' 'bout your boots walkin' out the door
Tonight, I know who I'm a-lookin' out for
And I'm thinkin' 'bout tomorrow girl (Ooh)
