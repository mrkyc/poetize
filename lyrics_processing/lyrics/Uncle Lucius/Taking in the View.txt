Waiting on his old rag top
Wondering where the hell have all the real souls gone
It's been so long since the reaping's worth a damn
Little Mary's living hand to mouth
Can't believe how fast it all went south
Taking pains to conceive of an immaculate life
But Jesus Christ it sure gets hard sometimes

And the bright Morning Star just left Chicago
He's headed down to Asheville Carolina via Ohio
They got a rich four-season climate
And ridge of mountains blue
And he's going to spend his golden years
Taking in the view
Ever since Joseph passed away
The lady hasn't had too much to say
You can find her kneeling in the garden
All skin and bones
And when seeds have grown
She'll plant again

Satan had to sell off half of hell
Now it's all suburban sprawl and big box stores
Well he can't be sure but this might be the end

And the bright Morning Star just left Chicago
He's headed down to Asheville Carolina via Ohio
He's got a stack of classic vinyl
And a turn-table to boot
And he's going to spend his golden years
Taking in the view
And he'll sing
I shall be released
And I've got a woman over town who's good to me
Walking the floor
And do-do-do looking out my back door
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in a church where a wedding's been
Not going to hear that train a'coming around the bend
And the bright Morning Star just left Chicago
He's headed down to Asheville Carolina via Ohio
They got a rich four-season climate there
And a ridge of mountains blue
And he's going to spend his golden years
