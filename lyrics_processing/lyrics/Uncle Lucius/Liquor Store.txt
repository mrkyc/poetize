I need my poison close at hand
Take me down to the liquor store now
The devil's dealt me an idle hand
I was born on a train on the fourth of July
Bout the time that my dad died in Nam
Wasn't given a chance or even a name
Spent a night in my sweet mama's arms
Then she gave me away to a railyard bum
Who drank bourbon and walked with a limp
Been a riding these rails since I drew my first breath
Guess to die here would only seem fit
So won't ya please now
Take me down to the liquor store now
I need my poison close at hand
Take me down to the liquor store now
The devil's dealt me an idle hand
I put thirty-two grand on a horse named Believe
And the jockey fell off of it's back
Now I'm really in deep with the shark this time
He'll kill me for cuttin me slack
See Uncle Lucius LiveGet tickets as low as $73You might also likeAnd my wife and my son are all I think about
And the pain is just too much to bear
So I'm searching for grace in the bottle tonight
Ever fearful of what's drawing near
So mister please now
Take me down to the liquor store now
I need my poison close at hand
Take me down to the liquor store now
The devil's dealt me an idle hand
Daddy hit her too hard on the days he was drunk
And quite often he'd touch her all wrong
So she grew up without a clue in the world
Just about what love really was
Now you'll find her up town selling pleasure for cash
To only the worst kind of men
There's a hole in her soul that she fills with a drink
And tonight she'll cry out again
Won't you please now
Take me down to the liquor store now
I need my poison close at hand
Take me down to the liquor store now
The devil's dealt me an idle hand
Take me down to the liquor store now
I need my poison close at hand
Take me down to the liquor store now
