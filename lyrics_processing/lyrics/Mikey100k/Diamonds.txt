Trap

Came a long way from the traphouse
Pull up on your bitch and blow her back out (woah)
Dividend, she don't know how to act now (no)
She gon' buss it when I pull the stack out (woah, oh)
She know that I only fuck bosses (woah, oh)
Hold on baby I can't take no losses (woah, oh)
All this jewelry on me got me bossin' (woah, oh)
Run it up I might just cop Porsche, yeah
It came with them horses (yeah)
Baby girl don't force this (yeah)
I mean yeah you gorgeous (yeah)
I just can't afford this (yeah)
You just want a nigga that ain't boring
I need me a lil' baby that's foreign (yeah)
Tryna be around when the fame comes (no way)
Same ones that doubted me the same ones
All up in my DMs say I changed though
Caught the wave, switched the game up

Ay lil' bitch don't waste my time
Please don't hit my line

Money on my mind
When I touch a mil' might flood my wrist all with them diamonds

Freeze 'em up, diamonds cold like freezer

Know a couple girls that want a threeway with me, me
They said they will even do a screenplay for free, free
But, I don't even think that I have the time 'cause-
 how niggas is on their grind gone-
I have more friends than your mom and dad combine
 catch my peace of mind
I'ma catch my peace of mind
Oh if you give me time
'Cause you know that I'ma shine
Oh I'ma shine
When I take the tab at night it show me all the lights
I get racks and jewelry up the devil overnight
