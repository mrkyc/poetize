Said she ain't fucking with me 'cause I got hoes hitting up my line
She don't mind fucking with me but she ain't side enough to be a sideline
I respect your decision, baby just listen
I don't fuck with them bitches
Don't pay no attention
Baby come roll with a nigga
Count up this dough with a nigga
Let me turn you to a star
Cause you would go broke with them niggas
You don't need that, baby you don't need that
Come and kick it where the G's at, come and kick it where the G's at
Baby this that real shit
I know those lame bitches hating on ya
But a real nigga waiting on ya
Don't keep me waiting, baby don't keep me waiting
No, no baby, I ain't to good with patience

I can have them hoes
Baby all I want is you
I'm just letting you know
Baby all I want is you
They be hitting up my line
Baby all I want is you
I don't give 'em no time
Baby all I want is you
