It feels so good to be me
Right now
It feels so good to be me
Right now

Am I trippin' or did I arrive in paradise?
I haven't felt this good in such a long time
Where are the cameras?
No, I don't wanna be surprised
Are we a victim of Kutcher on prime time?

'Cause this is unreal
And I can't afford to feel the way you make me feel
If this is not real
Throw me overboard so I can drift away from here

Who knew that someone like you would come and push me through
Out of my mood
Who knew that someone like you would come and push me through
Out of my mood
Electric current in my body that used to be numb
Look while I'm dancing in the street like I don't give a fuck
Who knew that someone like you would come and push me through
Out of my mood

My god, you got me in this groove (It feels so good to be me)
My god, you got me in this groove (Right now)
My god, you got me in this groove (It feels so good to be me)
My god, you got me in this groove (Right now)

You are the answer to the question
That I've been asking all this time
You're my lucky strike
Run my state of mind

Finally, I'm taking full control
Of this
Happiness, won't stop, I'm on a roll (Go)

'Cause this is unreal
And I can't afford to feel the way you make me feel
If this is not real
Throw me overboard so I can drift away from here (Drift away from here)

Who knew that someone like you would come and push me through
Out of my mood
Who knew that someone like you would come and push me through
Out of my mood

Look while I'm dancing in the street like I don't give a fuck
Who knew that someone like you would come and push me through
Out of my mood

My god, you got me in this groove (It feels so good to be me)
