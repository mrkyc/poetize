Baby got a ball cap on
Sure knows how to pull it off
Sun out of them hazel eyes
Looking so good but she don't try
Its just an old worn out hat
I always wore it turned back
But I couldn't help but laugh
When she took it away from me

She don't know a thing about the plays
And she could care less about the game
But if you saw her right now you'd think
It never belonged to me

Baby got a ball cap on
Sure knows how to pull it off
Sun out of them hazel eyes
Looking so good but she don't try
Actin' like its no big deal
Smilin' underneath that bill
Looking so right it's wrong
Baby got a ball cap on, yeah
She got a ball cap on
You might also like
Its seen a lot of crazy nights
Got a barbwire tear down the side
Yeah, and I wear it all the time but
Its never been worn like that

Baby got a ball cap on
Sure knows how to pull it off
Sun out of them hazel eyes
Looking so good but she don't try
Actin' like it's no big deal
Smilin' underneath that bill
Looking so right it's wrong
Baby got a ball cap on, yeah
She got a ball cap on

God I love it when she's in a dress
Always lookin' her best
But I'll tell you what I can't resist

Baby got a ball cap on
Sure knows how to pull it off
Sun out of them hazel eyes
Looking so good but she don't try
Actin' like its no big deal
Smilin' underneath that bill
Lookin' so right its wrong
Baby got a ball cap on, yeah
She got a ball cap on
