Make me Make me Make me Make me...
I let you get away from me
I let you go
I let you down
And something has changed for me
I need you to know
That I'm sorry
And I realise now that I was stone cold
And you had a heart of gold
And i saw the words as they were leaving my lips
Wish i could take 'em back
One thing, one thing that I regret
Believing the lies you fed me
I let, I let you in my head
Listenin' to what you said
One thing, one thing that I regret
Believing the lies you fed me
Made me something I was not
I thank you for changing me
Let you control everything
Once in it, it was wrong
Oh oh oh oh
But i don't know who's at fault
Oh oh oh oh
Cause I let myself
I thank you for changing me
Let you control everything
Once in it, it was wrong
Oh oh oh oh
But i don't know who's at fault
Oh oh oh oh
Cause I let myself
You might also likeI let this get away from me
I was confused
It must have seemed like i
Didn't even care at all
And I didn't know what to say
When you looked at me
And I just looked away
And you really left your mark
Along with the coffee stains
And empty picture frames
And I swear
That I am just wasting my time
And there's no turning back
One thing, one thing that I regret
Believing the lies you fed me
I let, I let you in my head
Listenin' to what you said
One thing, one thing that I regret
Believing the lies you fed me
Made me something I was not
Wish i could take 'em back
Made me something I was not
Wish i could take 'em ... Wish i could take 'em back
Made me something I was not
I thank you for changing me
Let you control everything
Once in it, it was wrong
Oh oh oh oh
But i don't know who's at fault
Oh oh oh oh
'cause I let myself
I thank you for changing me
Let you control everything
Once in it, it was wrong
Oh oh oh oh
But i don't know who's at fault
Oh oh oh oh
