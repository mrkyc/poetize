I barley recognise myself in hotel mirrors
I got bored before I found myself
At night I disappear
If I can find the plug I pull it out when I am clean
I leftward being just you and me
Not this ocean in-between

And you never stubbed your toe growing up
And now that's all you think about
So close to the surface
But still can't breathe or break it
Sucked into the bells of trumpets
Shout out to the heights of trees
The kind you only ever see in TV documentaries
And I don't care what you're saying
Because nothing ever happens for a reason
But that's what I am told
That's what I am told

Let's head south and settle in
Because the city has no sentiment
Pick the fruit
Like Vicodin
Written faces on our money
My hands are rough
But you don't mind
The silence hangs for the longest time
I swear I feel your skin on mine
You can scuff my shoes
But not my mind
You might also like
And you never stubbed your toe growing up
And now that's all you think about
So close to the surface
But still can't breathe or break it
Sucked into the bells of trumpets
Shout out to the heights of trees
The kind you only ever see in TV documentaries
And I don't care what you're saying
Because nothing ever happens for a reason
But that's what I am told
That's what I am told


And you never stubbed your toe growing up
And now that's all you think about
So close to the surface
But still can't breathe or break it
Sucked into the bells of trumpets
Shout out to the heights of trees
The kind you only ever see in TV documentaries
And I don't care what you're saying
Because nothing ever happens for a reason
But that's what I am told
