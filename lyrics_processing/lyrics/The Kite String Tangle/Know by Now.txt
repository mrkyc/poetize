When it is almost light outside
Coat smells like cigarettes
And you ask how was your night
You ran your car
Into a boat
That's something only you can do
Somehow we're keeping this afloat
Patched up the holes and set sail
If you don't know by now
You've got a hold on me
If you don't know by now
You've got a hold on me
And when you come apart
I will mend your tears
And when you drink too much
I will hold your hair
Sometimes when all I can
Think about's myself
You pull me up
Like what the fuck
Are you thinking
You might also likeAnd I will always be
The one you can't let go
And scream at on the phone
I know that I'm the one
And I will always be
The first one that you see
So you take it out on me
I will always be the one
We can sit in silence
Living in your small apartment
Where you went overboard
With plants and one thousand thread counts
And I can see you're thinking the same thing
It's nice to be
Out of those hilly suburbs
And into this breathing city
If you hadn't guessed by now
You've got a hold on me
If you hadn't guessed by now
You've got a hold on me
And when you come apart
I will mend your tears
And when you drink too much
I will hold your hair
Sometimes when all I can
Think about's myself
You pull me up
Like what the fuck
Are you thinking
And I will always be
The one you can't let go
And scream at on the phone
I know that I'm the one
And I will always be
The first one that you see
So you take it out on me
I will always be
I will always be
The one you can't let go
And scream at on the phone
I know that I'm the one
And I will always be
The first one that you see
So you take it out on me
I will always be the one
If you don't know by now
You've got a hold on me
If you don't know by now
