Stay a little longer
You drove for like an hour
Just to tell me that I talk too much
Can't you feel it getting stronger
Can't you feel us getting closer
Swept up and I can't get enough
Falling over at the thought
Of getting over
Just because I think we could go all night
Hoping I am on your mind
Like you are on mine
Who know's this could be my last thought
I like this thing we got
I can't see myself with anybody else but you
I can't see myself with anybody else
I like this thing we got
I can't see myself with anybody else but you
I can't see myself with anybody else
I like this thing we got
You might also likePlay no games with me
And I won't play it cool with you
If you don't know the rules
Then I can lead the way
And I'm so glad you're getting to know me
Even more for what you showed me
Against the car parked outside my place
Falling over at the thought
Of getting over
Just because I think we could go all night
Hoping I am on your mind
Like you are on mine
Who know's this could be my last thought
I like this thing we got
I can't see myself with anybody else but you
I can't see myself with anybody else
I like this thing we got
I can't see myself with anybody else but you
I can't see myself with anybody else
I like this thing we got
I don't ever want to let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Don't want to let you go
I don't ever want to let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Don't want to let you go
'Cause I like this thing we got
I can't see myself with anybody else but you
I can't see myself with anybody else
I like this thing we got
I can't see myself with anybody else but you
