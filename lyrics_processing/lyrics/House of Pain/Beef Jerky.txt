Please have some mercy
Lord have mercy on my soul, alleluia
An if you're tryin' to live right then peace to ya
But I'm a do ya if you try to get mine
So don't step outta line
Cause I'll smoke ya like a pig
You're like Dig
Why don't you believe
You can't comprehend the ill thoughts I conceive
I stuck Eve and left a mark on her man
And here is somethin' you just can't understand
Mama I just killed a man
Put the gun against his head
Pulled the trigger, now he's dead
My rhapsody's bohemian
But ya never see me in
Jail cause I just made bail
I gotta good attorney so the man can't burn me
Presley to the Jackson, Goetz to the Bernie
Last to the Ever, die I say never
Even though I'm gonna
I never run from a
Punk talkin' junk just to smack his teeth
Cause I beat a man who said it
If you really want beef

It's like that ya'll
It's like daddy-ilac
It's like this ya'll, come on!
(4x)
Chorus 2
With everything so perfect, I really hate to spoil it
But I think I'm about to loose it, my whole life is in the toilet
(2x)
So feel the rush as the flush starts suckin' you in
You want an earl with your girl, where the fuck you been?
We're just a couple of friends just drinkin' and cussin'
There really ain't no need for your fightin' and fussin'
Chorus 2
Chorus 1
I be gettin' demo out on the corner
And if it's my turn to get wrecked I'm gonna
Cause I'm on a expidition
You could even say I'm going on a mission
Competition, there ain't none
Open up your eyes, watch me rise like the sun
I got the gun plus a buck knife
Runnin' up on me is like sayin' fuck life
I got a hot piece of lead just set shit off
But you're runnin' from my steel cause your butter soft
And if you don't cough well then you don't get off
I beat a man who said it from south to north
And east to west, sugar, I'm the best
When it comes to givin' love, I don't give out no stress
It's strictly Buddha-blessed lovin' in the raw
I be the flyest white boy you ever saw
So turn out the lights and lock the door
Cause I'm bringin' more love than ya bargained for
And if ya want beef I got fillet mingion
And if you're looking fot the brothers, just play my song
Cause I can keep it on and on like Naughty
Come to the club alone and leave with your hotty
