From the womb to the tomb
From the earth to the moon
And from the sea to the sky
And from the brain through the eye

From the celtic tribes, and the highland plains
I hit you with the quickness, like bad brains
I ain't blowin' no spikes, no queers, no dykes
Just the pale-faced cracker in the high-top nikes
Dope bustin' mics, I smoke cannibus
And if it's God's day off, in the sig I trust
You don't think I bust, you don't know my style
I got kids that'll hit ya on the low-profile
I've been from 248, out to east New York
My earth don't wear swine
I don't eat pork From no rusty fork, or no silver spoon
Put down your silver platter, kid, come check the data
My crew's chock-full of free information
It's jihad, Mecca be the destination
Glory be to God one more prostration
The root and foundation of civilization

Makin' shit happen, transition to casual moods
I'm livin' revelations, for real spiracle
I unroll the mythical chronic, keep an airborne stash
To make Divine's stein shine in this killah rhyme clash
Now seven false gods, (c'mon) step through the temple
Loose joints tremble, a brother said I resemble
The teachings of Jesus they sat down and said teach us
The illest earthly dreams of drama homicide schemes
I said brother mind want cream, but brothers i see green
Of a once warm flesh to arrest their peace
Never release your finger piece to go up in you with no crease
Then a priest overcame one sunlight, and beamed
And blessed on the DNA legacy in me
CHORUS

My teacher teaches the wickedness, out of my swiftness
My mental be kickin' the shit out my physical
Ridiculous duels, and ridiculous deals
Make a brother want to clot some chrome inch steel
My finger on the trigger a destiny for real
I sit in purgatory tryin' to break seven seals
Nine hells deep I see nine of me creep
But divine of me seek to put nine of me to sleep
I exhaust my existence, the pain is persistent
My mind got the quickness, I'm on my own hit-list
I head to gates of warped states and parralellistics
Now if knowledge is the essence of every man
Link him up with his wisdom so they understand
No matter, who ya be set your culture free
Cause' its the final hour time to refine your power
We're all equal, livin' man is God
You can't destroy what I build, cause i'm all of me killed
That's my cypher, my atom is a sphere and a square
Cause I'm here and I'm there from the sea to the air
CHORUS

All praise is due to Allah, the most gracious
The most merciful, the most benevolent
Master of the Day of Judgment, keep us all well

Yes man, all praise and glory is due to you
