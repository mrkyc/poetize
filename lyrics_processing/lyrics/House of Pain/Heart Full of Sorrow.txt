If I was to sit down and actually write out a list
Of the MC's that missed it would be the constitution
They play their caps backwards, still saying wack words
No power to Durhust, just a few yes-men
Raising the question of who gave you a contract?
They should be fired, you're officially retired

I see you make a little cash and start showing your ass
You get laced up with jewels, your crews acting like fools
Playing hard rock surrounded by bodyguards
Hoping no one pulls your card, you got me laughing pretty hard
Thinking you the white-hot man of the hour
But you just can't figure how your flavor went sour
Back in '89 PE fought the power
And in' 86 Big Daddy Kane was raw!

And I was right there on the first floor of the Palladium
You never played a venue, local college or a stadium
A young boy's pen and pad fad is now a grown man's profession
To earn this is a blessing, these skills have me guessing
Learn cause I'm testing, follow this down no question

No doubt, check it out
You be either rhyming in code or on some gangster node
You all clockwork apocalypse you about to implode
Collapsing on yourself cause your whole foundation is
Built on lies, don't apologize
Cause once they watch you rise they wanna watch you fall
And they'll all take a piece just like the Berlin wall
And place it on their mantle like a souvenir
And what they call a knick-knack is really your career
You might also like
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow

When it's time to rise I'll open the archives
When you be in dreams you got 8's and 5's
Chrome down with the leather package
You got a home of your own
You're holding acres (I got it made)
Season tickets to the Knickers and the Lakers
Playing both coasts closed and European festivals
Crowd scream decibels
Crowd scream decibels in your ear
You wanna make rapping your career?

From Arkansas to Minnesota I sell out the quota
I be the wet dream making cream for promoters
We keep the shit right we don't be starting no fights
And he won't hold out my dough cause I'mma put out his lights
And once the crew hits the stage the crowd gets involved
We show love, they show it back, all problems solved
You can boom-shalak and jump to the sounds I pump
But I ain't quitting till I'm shitting on Donald Trump!
Verse 7: Divine Styler
So take heed to the verses and styles and versions
When you socialize with other MC's
And boast your rhymes to company enemies
And in any cases that feel is what you want
Flam and flow with your crew and then select ya floss
You want to make money money and take every honey
Rap charges ain't funny but it boost your career
Your penile style is now hanging from a tier
Now you wanna know fear to impress your peers
Now your ass outta here, the rap game goes on..
