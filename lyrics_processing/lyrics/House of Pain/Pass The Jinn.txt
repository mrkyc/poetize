Aight aight aight woah woah yo
Thissa war yuh hear now nar what i'm saying?
This a O, O and in the middle of the O is a T
And in that T is a serial shit there (lay the fuck down) haha
Rock on
Real bumbaclot
Ragga bloodclot muffin in this bass sound
So-ah so ah
Ayo, Dip dip dive so so-a liver
Carry ya ice creams, son run ya money and deliver
Front never, blood brother or ya space terror
A river incase you get it straight
Before me have em shook, who seh I move and fuck wit'
Cockni don't rep or tend to judge clique
This lyric straight up outta auto with nastiness
You best confess without trying press some business
Ya mother or ya ass
Wrote ya broke
Come poke
Pop joke
While i pop chunk i pull back click and FIRE

Watch out, bust the style I be kicking
I play the geek role and bite your head off like a chicken
I'm the Lord of the Rings like Bilbo Baggins
Return of my dragon, pants be sagging
Science be dropping, thoughts be building
My instinct's primal, tapping your spinal
I'll smack Mike and Janet for the whole freaking planet
Don't take me for granted, cause my eyes be slanted
From the fat bag of blade I must consume
Cause my soul's on the verge of impending doom
So make room for the crew with kegs of brew
Doing what we do, so what's the matter with you?
You might also like
Now the west can be wild
And the south can keep it hot
The north will be the spot for the criminals and whatnot
But the East Coast sets the most irate styles
The east coast sunning all bitch profiles
Yo relax that shit, I murder abstract myth
My mathematics be the fifth, power refines gifts
All been born to the divine stylists
My Killa Rhyme Klik tastes mics with ruckus and riffs
I keep the swine cliques dead as with the bodies I lift

Nuffadiss and nuffadat and nuffadat
Who better not (...)
You have to tek it back (...)
We keepin dem puffin' an puffin claat
Boxing with the liver (...)
Clickclik, ya hear that? that's ya raas on the spot
BOOYACKA,
BLATA-KA fucker run faster than that
(..)
You are go dead
(...)
Kill man kill, no deeper than box
Don't get me ignorant beez
I cautious dreadlocks
If yuh no live like one blood
You are gon' dead in one box
I bow my head to the east five times a day
I put my face in the dirt every time I pray
To disrupt the Jinn in me, cause the sin in me's
Trying to take over and make my soul crossover
I'm steady rolling, with my head fucked up
Cause my system pumps loud, everybody's on my nuts
And everybody wants to know who lives the phattest
The black 850 representing my status
Plus I got the baddest, House on the Hill (shit!)
My bank account's full, but my Soul's empty still

Who want get burst from Earth to hearse to dust?
My motley crew will move them more straight now fix on plush
Honeys blush, what, my mechanism ray-beam
Steam Novocaine, supreme Novocaine
Numb niggas get the shivers when I snap the vein
I sniff styles over mirror and blows my membrane, uh
How's it taste? the glaze and I froze on
A b-boy stance, I'm getting my rose on
Blitz unsurpassable and getting my doze on
Hallucinating bitches and they ripping my clothes off

Big up
Cockni's got wicked rhymes!
So, no never in my crowd will you hear a loud boo-ah
Prouder than bitches that go on like whore-ah
Straight from womb
Not from the sewer
No disrespect money, ya come correct
Ain't a pity if mommy make a mother out of a sister
Earth, hear that said I cursed and dissed her
Yo, baby keep calm
Baby don't cry
Hope the kid had a mommy so that they stay fly
I said take me to your House of Pain!
See my style's maintained cause my membrane's sane
So put down your juice, pass your Jinn
Push up on a skin, I be in to win
There ain't no need to worry about where I've been
If I pass my Jinn, I be in to win
I say, put down your juice, pass the Jinn
Push up on a skin, I be in to win
There ain't no need to worry about where I've been
If I pass my Jinn, I be in to win

Style expansion, ill drills from my mansion
Destroy ass emcees, that's glancing and sizing
My mental through my pencil
Be making biting exciting
Test my novacaine writings and sketch my auras
They be wet like the ocean
They get cut off my crows
Frontin invading my motion
Suckers blowing me like hoes
Because they on my balls
But I kick the livest saliva
When I got the mic control
Divine style, the hold up
Shit like it's a stick up
Nobody getting up from my licking up
Niggas is kicking up
You wind up vic'd up
From slipping my mission
Is all in ya ass you young motherfuckers respect my past
So who on next, uh, come represent this session
