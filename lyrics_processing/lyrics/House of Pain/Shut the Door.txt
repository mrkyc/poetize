Baby, bounce to my rhythm, I be radiating static
With toys in my attic, style's automatic
I love 'em Asiatic, Japanese and Puerto Rican
Every time I start speaking, I wind up freaking on
Some little floozy naked in my Jacuzzi
If you think I'm not choosy then the joke's on you
You want the 411, baby, here's my style
I like 'em young but I'm no freaking pedophile
I'm known to set it wild, young girls get creamy
Swing 'em through the morn and the Ev will get steamy
You can't see me, I play the set low
Scraping on the bottom, smoking L's if I got 'em
And I ain't too proud to beg for your leg
Let me push up in the thighs and fertilize your egg
Let me make your nature rise along with your blood pressure
Strip you down bare, lay your things on the dresser
While the children of the lesser God play the hard rock role
Girl, I stay rock hard

So if I get mine, you'll get yours
And we can take it to the wild side behind closed doors
Rip off your stockings and drop your drawers
We can take it to the wild side behind closed doors

You couldn't meet me, half on half with that cream you stash
So baby i burn my desire for that ass
Its so hard for a brother to pass, you're so crush
I be thinking how her legs curve, get the thrust
Get the thrust, but once I big up
I'mma stick up the seam
(Cockni o Dire:)
Comin in comin comin ya betta stoppa there
(Divine Styler)
Enough of this give 'em shit, baby let's beam
Word to earth, check the scheme
I got the flavor mad sabretooth mad soul
Don't act, front or style just blaze on back
Come fix Divine Style, connect summer child
I knows it's Pop Dukes I got the means to protect
And shelter my roots, God-proof master
Allah - Divine loot has to motivate the rapture
To my hot butter mate, feel my hot dubplate
C'mon baby, ease on back uh!

(Verse 3: Cokni O'Dire)
How do you feel, someone is real
Magnet to steel, chant chop in your libido
Know what I mean
Who man you feen
To have between your piece and (??)
Mind on your flex, latex your sex
Never complex, nobadda bust a def
You know the deal and you a betta kneel
Magnet to steel
Baby-uh
(Verse 4: Everlast)
Ah baby, can't you feel it, deep down inside ya
I can't hide the fact I wanna ride ya
Body up and down and then back and forth
Kind of like Aaliyah, girl, I wanna see ya
Oh, you look good, honey bun, I can't fake it
And word is bond I just got to get you naked
And once you're naked I'm a lick your skin
Then touch you in spots that ain't nobody else been
I'll kiss you down there when you're bare
And I swear that I'll do it right
I'll make it last all night
But don't put up a fight cause I ain't Macho Man Randy
I'm not a Savage, I just want some candy
And it's, fine and dandy if you need some time
But let me know whatcha think and, sugar, ease my mind
Let me know where I stand, come take my hand
Give me a hug, then lay me down on the rug
