I be breaking the laws, breaking the laws
All you wannabe hard rocks just pause
It's the MC host Space ghost from the coast
With pinkish white skin
Kid, where you been?
I got a blue eye but my title ain't devil
I freak harmonies like my brothers was Neville
And I could rock a Creole style
Eating crawdad stew
So whatcha wanna do?
I'm coming real soon to a theater near you
So why don't you critique me while I'm live on stage?
Cause I'm gonna break my - rusty cage, my rusty cage
Watch the way I freak it when I bust my gauge
Cause all that loud gun talk, it don't mean squat
If my tool ges hot, I'm a burst your knot
And give it all I got up in your wisdom slot
And Cutty Ranks couldn't stop her
From calling me poppa
Big daddy jaw-dropper, Mr. Heartbreaker
She leaves Mary Poppins but she comes home Seka
Chorus
Yes yes y'all
Cause I'm so fly (so fly)
Everlast be the apple of your Earth's eye
Yes yes y'all
Cause we dont fake (don't fake)
And D. Style come to feel your earthquake
You might also like
Socialize a little something and you sweating my style
Challenge your world and check the shell I'm in
You wanna sit with my flesh and recognize the test?
You never seen this niggas best
I mesmerize your nest
I'm hittin' your head with styles that are liquid
You drip this, sweat this
Perspire this desire, this wetness
You get from Divine Style, spark this girl, chill
I see you got the love, the lust
So won't you live my cosmos exodus
Unto my precious I'mma undress my message
Into my wisdom body to my wisdom method
You need a star for your crescent
I guided the alphabets
For your atmosphere my-a dope mathematics
Will soak you like it's insincere
Uh, baby, from my apparatus
I do the justice to your physical, anoint your aider
Nourishment of your Nova, a hard style at stages
While the guard be sparking that indo seed
The Earth pieces be increasing the need to be pleased
I represent the illest villains and the worst of bad breeds
Ah baby, if you wanna next my vision
You better come with subject of vision
I keep it real live, and keep it real straight
Til the Earth mate feel D. Style's Earthquake
Chorus (x 2)
(I said baby be calm, baby don't cry
Divine Styler: This is only your fear the universe is on time) (X2)

My love's stronger than pride
My love's thicker than blood
My killer squad's in effect
Nobody's living off HUD
If your missile's a scud
I'll run a patriot gig
I'll have you flipping your wig
I'll put the clip in my SIG
And cock the hammer back (Click-Clack)
Put a hole in your back
The size of a plum, you can come get some
But my attitude shitty like G. Gordon Liddy
Take pity on a child that's been raised in the city

Chill from East to West
To maintain my rep
So many times y'all assume my flow
I go mono, stereo or solo
You never know, choose a flow
And I'll throw the phattest venom
I'm so hot, and so law and so far from the planet
I reflected lady's drama for the ladies that be scanning
My composition de-circular
Hurting the mad opposition
