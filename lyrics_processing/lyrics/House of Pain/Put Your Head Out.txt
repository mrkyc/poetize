I rip shit like a bow when I flow
And I score points with the joints that I throw
'Cause I flow daily, I'm no punk, see
I break backs, make tracks, and get funky
There's no one to run to 'cause nobody cares
MCs drop to your knees, say your prayers
The luck o' the Irish is about to kick in
Prepare to die, notify your next o' kin
I'm goin' all out, buck, duck, and call out
That's how I'm livin', punk, ya better stall out
This is the House of Pain (Pain)
To come inside is insane

I'll put ya head out (I'll put ya head out)
I'll put ya head out (I'll put ya head out)
Jump up and spread out
I'll put ya head out
I'll put ya head out, put, put ya head out
Jump up and spread out
I'll put ya head out

Yo, what up, punk, punk?
I'll put ya head out
You might also like
Who steps to booz
When the hoods wanna take a cruise?
They're feelin' effects of the booze
Ain't no clues, to hell with them fools
Who got smoked even though they strap tools
They got brews, but I got the boomer
Trigga to blast ya and skip the bull
Take my life, shit, I'll take you to school
In a duel, what's the difference if you think you're droppin' jewels?
Carbon copy, think you're so cool
Stop dreamin' and hallucinatin'
You're caught up in a piece I'm paintin'
Click click, punk, now you're thinkin', "Oh shit"
Quit while you're ahead before I fill you full of lead

I'll put ya head out (Put ya head out)
I'll put ya head out (Put ya head out)
Jump up and spread out
I'll put ya head out
I'll put ya head out, put, put ya head out
Jump up and spread out
I'll put ya head out

Blessed with the gift, and gets with the rhyme
I never say quit when I'm out to get mine
It's live and let die, sit back, and get high
Smokin' a fat blunt, waitin' for some punk
To act up like he's got somethin' in him
Then I grab the mic and start spittin' out venom
Carvin' up headstones, blowin' out headphones
Steppin' to me, ya wind up in the Dead Zone
It's nothin' personal, that's how it goes, G
Step up with beef and you'll wind up losin' teeth
'Cause I don't give up the mic that easy
Step back, this ain't government cheese, G
You can stand in line, but you ain't gettin' it
Talk all the shit ya want, but I ain't sweatin' it
I'll put ya head out (I'll put ya head out)
I'll put ya head out (I'll put ya head out)
Jump up and spread out
I'll put ya head out
I'll put ya head out, put, put ya head out
Jump up and spread out
