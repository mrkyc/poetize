Well if Jesus is your Lord, then praise your God
If Islam's your thing, Allahu Akbar
And if you represent the six-pointed star
Well then my Heebs back home told me say, "Shalom!"
I put grooves in the mix
I make moves like the Knicks
And take you straight up the lane
I block out the frame
And then I freeze it, believes it
You needs it like heroin
Before you get your fight on
Kid, get your stare on
Here come the Don Dada making Ghettos Red Hotta
I drop the boom-bada like Jake LaMotta
I can single you out and isolate you like Mono
I'm undefeated like Rocky Marciano
Hit you right below the belt, now you're singing soprano
Talk what you talk, still you don't know what I know

Some fiend for ass
Some fiend for cash
Some do the knowledge
Some do the math
Some stick to the road
Some stray from the path
Some do the knowledge
Some do the math

Now East Coast, West Coast
Money, what's the beef?
It's going down rough like swallowing teeth
I say word to Thin Lizzy, kid I get busy
And I'll knock all of y'all off this Wonderwall
Cause on a daily basis, I rock like Oasis
Bit the Beatles style, from a fetus to a child
I kill fourteen million cells puffing L's
Stomping devils on all nine levels of Hell
Check the transmission, hear the transition
Observe the technician in finite vision
Your highlight reels are laced by drug deals
As you scheme to check feels on chicks in high heels
It's all bright and sunny when you're holding big money
But my Sonic's got Youth, plus my Mud got honey
I can be The King of Grunge if I blow my Sponge away
There's a little black spot on the sun today
Which I don't care if my soul's up there
So come on and feel the Sting from the true Pain King

Some fiend for ass
Some fiend for cash
Some do the knowledge
Some do the math
Some stick to the road
Some stray from the path
Some do the knowledge
