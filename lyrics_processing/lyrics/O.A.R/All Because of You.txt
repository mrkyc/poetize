Don't, don't, don't forget to hold 'em
Stay, stay, stay a little longer
Can, can, can you hear the night talk?
Two hearts beating on a sidewalk
Put your head on my shoulder
I want to matter when we go outside, and
Hold your hand when we say goodnight, and
Tell you how I'm gonna to make our dreams come true
All because of you
I made a promise in the morning breezes
You can have all the space you need, and
You know me better than you'll ever need to prove
All because of you
All because of you
Wake, wake, wake up to you smiling
Don't, don't, don't know where the time went
Can we dance a little slower?
I, I, I'll be here forever
We're so good when we're together
Let me hold you 'til we're older

Hold your hand when we say goodnight, and

You can have all the space you need, and
You know me better than you'll ever need to prove
All because of you
I know that I can be a better man, and
Learn to run when it's hard to stand, and
Find the songs in everything you do
It's all because of you
I never thought I'd find you in this life
Broken shadows disappear tonight
You're the reason that all my dreams come true
All because of you
