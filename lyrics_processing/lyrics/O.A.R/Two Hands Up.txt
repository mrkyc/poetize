Way back when we used to plan and pretend
That life we were living was a ten 'til then
We already had love, we already had faith
But it turns out we need a little bit of space
So between the two of us the world was divided
You went for schooling and I went for the highway
But silent nights and missing pieces
Weighed heavier than ever on my heart

I got my two hands up, I surrender
Come and lock me up here forever
Cause I need your love, just remember
You make me feel like I can surrender
Two hands up at your service
The beat of my heart is making me nervous
Give you all of my love now and forever
You make me feel like I can surrender

I got that white flag waving
Baby come save me
I'm ready for love in my heart
I mean I'm here for the taking
I won't be escaping
There's no need to sound the alarm

I got my two hands up, I surrender
Come and lock me up here forever
Cause I need your love, just remember
You make me feel like I can surrender
Two hands up at your service
The beat of my heart is making me nervous
Give you all of my love now and forever
You make me feel like I can surrender

I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always gonna stay around
You have my heart
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always gonna stay around
You have my heart

I got my two hands up, I surrender
Come and lock me up here forever
Cause I need your love, just remember
You make me feel like I can surrender
Two hands up at your service
The beat of my heart is making me nervous
Give you all of my love now and forever
You make me feel like I can surrender
I got my two hands up
I got my two hands up
You make me feel like
You make me feel like
I can surrender
I'm pleading, I'm waiting, I'm leaving
