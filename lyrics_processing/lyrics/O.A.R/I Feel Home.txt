There are few things pure in this world anymore
And home is one of the few
We'd have a drink outside
Maybe run and hide if we saw a couple men in blue
But to me it's so damn easy to see
That my people are my people at home
Well I've been away but now I'm back today
And there ain't a place I'd rather go
I feel home
When I see the faces that remember my own
I feel home
When I'm chillin outside with the people I know
I feel home
And that's just what I feel
My home to me is reality
And all I need is something real
Feelin alright, headin out to the night
Maybe off to a dark driveway
I say now some feel bored
And some are lookin for more
Well, we all just decided to stay
We got nothin to do
But when I look at you
I see someone I know and love
And just the crack of your smile made me stay for a while
For my home there is nothing above

Is something I pray will be  true
And in a thousand years after a thousand tears
I will find my original crew
Cuz to me there's nowhere  else than  I'd rather be
Sitting back there at home
And on those long dark drives on that road I made
In my heart I'm at home
I feel home
When I see the faces that remember my own
I feel home
When I'm chillin outside with the people I know
I feel home
And that's just what I feel
My home to me is reality
And all I need is something real
My home to me is the only reality I have left
I need  something real
That's why I go home
I feel home
I feel my home
Hostile and all
Music it brings me home
I lay down at night
I feel that road under me rolling
The yellow line might lead me away
But it gonna bring me home
I don't care where you come from
I don't really care where you go
All I need to know is right at this moment
We're all at home
I don't care where you come from
I don't care where you're going
All I need to know is we're all in our home
My heart's on my soul
The music it brings me home
Reality to me is that door
And I walk through
I walk through
I'm walking back to you
