Tell me what am i to do?
And you just want me to stay, here
So i'm just gonna stay, here
Home, the last resort
Build a castle with an iron door
Lock the window, pull the shades, the hazed out sun won't help anyway
If the world is crumbling down, I don't wanna be alone
NO, locked up in this place
I heard the world up, late night
Holding my breath tight, trying to keep my head on right
There's a chill in the air, nobody could care
How you're caught up in the fight of your life
Fear, is holding me here
The television got me seeing unclear
Bravery, my neighbor, moved away
Cause I don't need to be courageous today
If the world was crumbling down, I don't wanna be alone
NO, locked up in this place
I heard the world up, late night
Holding my breath tight, trying to keep my head on right
There's a chill in the air, nobody could care
How you're caught up in the fight of your life

There's a chill in the air, nobody could care
How you're caught up in the fight of your life
Nothing's gonna save me
I'm hanging from the nearest tree
Nothing's gonna save me
