Was it him who said that life is just a song?
I don't know what will keep me on this little Earth
I just might use the love that's all in the dirt
But every damn time
That I see you
I say to myself
She ain't worth it
Uh no no
She ain't worth nothin I got
Ah no way
Nah nah
Get away to get in
Was it you who said that my life is over?
Baby it was over from the bitter start
Did you say that I won't be around downtown tomorrow?
Ah yes I will with a hardened heart
But every damn time
That I see you
I say to myself
She ain't worth it
No no
She ain't worth nothin I got
Ah no no Ah no way
Na uh

She really doesn't know about the way she taunts
It's tearin me apart
It's tearin me apart
I was walkin yesterday at night in the park
And I saw a little girl standin on the corner of the world
And I said little girl what ya doin in the world
She looked up at me and I said for what its worth
And I said the winds been blowing hard for oh bout a 1000 years at a time
But its time to stop the hate
I said get away to get up
Get away to get up
Get away, something to say uh way oh
Did you mean something mean
When you said my soul was clean
Well I know all the stories that I've been told
Are nothin but a product sold
I was walkin last night
I was thinkin kinda funky I was ready to fight
Feelin kinda friskey drank a pint of wiskey
Never did I know what did it would and kiss me
Up cross the mouth I flick down south
My head started spinnin like a whriley mount
And I said hey girl gotta run away
Gotta ask something, something gotta say
And I said hey something dont ya know nothin
Dont ya see the world that is comin to unfurl
And I said I dont wanna say nothin now
Except get away to get up
Get away to get up
Get away to get up
