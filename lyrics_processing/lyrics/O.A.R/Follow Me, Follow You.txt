My heart beating for you
Hands are waiting on you
Eyes just looking at you
On the street we know
Broken windows
Are we both so different, honey?
Damn these days are never like the dreams we know

Listen close and turn around
I know your heart can hear me now

Follow me, I'll follow you
When there's waves on your river and a fire in your sky
Carry me, I'll carry you
When you're lost in the tunnel and you can't see the light
(Oh woah oh)
If you follow me, I'll follow you
(Oh woah oh)
If you follow me, I'll follow you

We could rule together
Walk this line forever
Damn this always weather
Blinds the way we know

I know your heart can hear me now

Follow me, I'll follow you
When there's waves on your river and a fire in your sky
Carry me, I'll carry you
When you're lost in the tunnel and you can't see the light
(Oh woah oh)
If you follow me, I'll follow you

(I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting, yeah)
I got your back, so call on me now
(I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting, yeah)
I got your back, so call on me now
Call on me now
Follow me, I'll follow you
We could run through the city
We could fly through the sky

Follow me, I'll follow you
When there's waves on your river and a fire in your sky
Carry me, I'll carry you
When you're lost in the tunnel and you can't see the light
(I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting, yeah)
