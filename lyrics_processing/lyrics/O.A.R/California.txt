If you never want to be a silhouette you got to find your light
Eh, For forty days and forty nights
You lie awake, I know you cry
But dreaming in your room isn't ever going to get it done
Yeah you have to walk before you run
Hey son, go to California
Dance with the angels dress how you wanna
Anyway, just like the river starts with the raindrop
You'll make it better
Papa said, son fight like the great ones
Keep your chin tucked just like I taught ya'
Anyway, who said you can't go
Where you wanna
California
So call me when your close and you feel them city lights
Don't let the voices in your head talk too
You know they tell you lies
Yeah, for a hundred days, a hundred years
Yeah, there'll be demons and there'll be fears
One day you're gonna look back how far you've gone
But you better walk before you run
Hey son, go to California
Dance with the angels dress how you wanna
Anyway, just like the river starts with the raindrop
You'll make it better
Papa said, son fight like the great ones
Keep your chin tucked just like I taught ya'
Anyway, who said you can't go
Where you wanna
California
