And he was looking for a ride to New Mexico
Well we was driving by
Way too fast to know
Well then we got to the place on a high speed chase
There was a girlie in the corner with a plastic face
And then she disappeared without a trace
I say without a trace
Well now we're kicking back
Sipping beers
There's a man telling stories about his inner fears
We was all choked up, too close to tears
So i'm moving on up to a couple margaritas
I made a couple of faces at a couple senoritas
Playing drinking games, but she too young to be with me
So now, my car broke down about an hour ago
We were heading on down to New Mexico
Well we did not see the gas was low
The gas was low
Yes, so low
So low
I lost my soul
Somewhere on the road
But I'm gonna get it back real soon
Mike, could you get it back for me?

Been wondering around in circles for years
Chasing my tail
Looking for answers to questions, I've never heard
It's a wide open world
I'm trying to find it
It's a wide open sky
It's light and blinding
And it's raining down on me
It's slowing me down
But I keep on going
I know I recognize this man walking in front of me
When he turned around and locked eyes with me
And it scared me to see
Myself in 20 years
Lost ashamed, locked up, loaded down
So I didn't know that I could change my ways
And I took a different road
No more running around in circles
No more chasing my tail
So I'm going forward these days
With my eyes closed
I know I can make it, fuck it I know I can make it if I try
I must let love live inside me for a while
And maybe later on, I'll see you all after the show
I heard this story down here about an hour ago
I am a different man
Different than I was
