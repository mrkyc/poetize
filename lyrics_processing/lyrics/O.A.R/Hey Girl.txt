We walked along lonely streets and got to know ourselves
I like to read, she likes to write
She likes to sleep and I like to stay up all night
My friends say I'm crazy, and I agree
But that's OK, cause that's the way she likes to be

Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
We went out late last night and we danced through the night
I was holding on to her and she was gripping me tight
But I didn't care, and she didn't mind
I was unaware that she liked to act so kind
My friends say she's crazy and I agree
That's OK, that's the way I like to be

Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Just let yourself go

Later on that night I took her home
I asked if she felt alright being alone
So I went inside, and she didn't mind
Took two to decide that I wasn't going home tonight
I see we're both crazy, that's alright with me
The night was kind of hazy that's the way it's gonna be

Hush little baby don't say a word
I'd like to give you everything that you deserve
I'll give you my heart, give you all my soul
You can ask for my money. If you like you can have control
In my mind, I miss you every night that you're not here
Oh, I just want to sit around your life and breathe your air
And if i cannot have you, I just don't want to live
Oh I got so much I'd like to give
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Just let yourself go
My baby, my darling
Just let yourself go
My baby, my darling
I need to know
My sweetie, my lovely
I'd love to let you go
