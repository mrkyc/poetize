There was time now it's far away
I didn't know you, but I knew your name
We would talk, I got nothing to say
But hear me now
You're like an angel that is just for me
Bless your heart, let your mind go free
And it's too loud on the Earth today
So let's go home and

Lay down and rest here in my arms
Now lay down
Lay down, the universe is ours
Lay down, lay down, lay down

Catch a teardrop, bleed the heart
Masquerade in a world apart
From a mass that got more to lose, I'm making a run
So blessed angel that is just for me
Catch the dream, there's a lot to see
But it's too loud on the Earth today
So let's go home and

Lay down and rest here in my arms
Now lay down
Lay down, the universe is ours
Lay down, lay down, lay down

I never seen a body move the way you do
Rocking steady and you know it too
You had to come down from Heaven above and tease the world
So listen good, 'cause I'm telling it straight
I don't got no more time to waste
I got a trip planned past the sun
Taking you home

Yeah, oh, oh-ho, ho
To lay down and rest here in my arms
Now lay down
Lay down, the universe is ours
Lay down, lay down, lay down

Oh, now I see
I bought a planet for you
Planned it for you, my dear
There's no one above you
I purchased a room with a view
So we can fly away to outer space
We'd be alone just us two
And you know it's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
It's all for you
Oh, come on
Ooh, lay it down
Mmm, lay it down
Ooh, ooh, lay down
Lay it down, ooh-hoo
