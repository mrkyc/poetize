Lookin' for the gold and the modern day jewels
It come to pass what was stuck in my head
If I didn't quit on looking that I'd probably be dead
I hit the road and I rolled up north
Lookin for the origin, the place of my birth
I didn't notice when I ran a red sign
Hopin' that everything would really be fine
Well people come and people go
But they never know what is going on
So they gotta try to be what they wanna be
What the hell is happenin' to me?
I hit the road and I rolled up north
Lookin for the origin, the place of my birth
I didn't notice when I ran a red sign
Hopin' that everything would really be fine
Well I set out about an hour ago
Lookin for my gold and I'm sayin a-oh
And I went down lookin for that big that big baby big brass show
So I, I went and then I started to go
Walkin down that same old same old road
Thinkin to myself it's quite a struggle
What am I going to do tomorrow?
I'm gonna find my gold
And conquer me some fools, yeah
See O.A.R LiveGet tickets as low as $5You might also likeA long, long time ago
I found myself looking for fools
And what I did not let myself know
Is that these fools were inside my mind
I loved to do right all the time
But I found there are times when I loved to do so wrong
And I know that the fools are at the bottom of it all
When no substance can control you
You done conquered that fool
And when that alcohol can not own you
You done conquered that fool
And when no one person runs you
You must conquer that fool
And when you're learnin in books everything you need to know
Well you can conquer them fools
You can conquer them fools that's right
