Crooked days left behind
These closed eyes
The places that we've been
Footsteps and handprints
The more we've yet to see the more I find
It's all we have
So good so far
It's not over 'til we're done
And we've only just begun
I'm in the middle of the longest fight
I've ever had in all my life
And it ain't over 'til we've won
Well I was thoughtless and careless
The day I lost my innocence
Chasing you into the sun
It's okay when I'm afraid
It's okay when I'm a fool
Who only plays the cards he's got
It's all we have
So good so far

So good so far
And we've only just begun
So good so far
I'm in the middle of the longest fight
I've ever had in all my life
And it ain't over 'til we've won
So here's to tomorrow
The next one that follows
All and anything that comes
We'll let the summer kiss the day
Watch the rains come in
And wash away the crazy thing we've done
It's all we have
So good so far
All we have
So good so far
It's so good so far
I'm in the middle of the longest fight
I've ever had in all my life
And it ain't over 'til we've won
It's not over 'til we're done
So good so far
And we've only just begun
So good so far
I'm in the middle of the longest fight
I've ever had in all my life
And it ain't over 'til I've won
This ain't over 'til we're done
So good so far
And we've only just begun
So good so far
I'm in the middle of the longest fight
I've ever had in all my life
