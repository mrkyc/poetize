I saw Adam leave the Garden
With an apple in his hand
"Now you're out, what are you gonna do?"
"Plant my crops and pray for rain
Think I'll raise a little cane
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through."

Passing through, passing through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passing through

I saw Jesus on that cross
On the hill called Calvary
"Do you hate mankind for what they did to you?"
He said, "Speak of love not hate
There's things to do, it's growing late
I've so little time and I'm just passing through"

Passing through, passing through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passing through
You might also like
I shivered with George Washington
At Valley Forge that day
"Why do your soldiers freeze here like they do?"
He said "Men will suffer, fight
Even die for what is right
Even though they know they're only passing through"

Passing through, passing through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passing through

I was at Franklin Roosevelt's side
Just a while before he died
He said, "One world must come out of World War Two
Yankee, Russian, white, or tan
Lord, a man is just a man
We're all brothers, and we're only passing through"

Passing through, passing through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passing through
Well I rode with old Abe Lincoln
On that train to Gettysburg
I asked him "What are we gonna do?"
He said "Every man must be
Unconditionally free
Or there is no reason to be passing through"

Passing through, oh, passing through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passing through
I'm passing through, just, passing through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
