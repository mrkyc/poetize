And he said, "This is for me."
He had a pack on his big strong back
He was tall as a redwood tree
Well the girls passed by and he winked his eye;
He said, "I'm July Jones
I'm the man for you, I'm six foot two
All muscle, meat and bones."
Great July Jones, Well Great July Jones
He's got a way they can't resist
He kisses the girls and they stay kissed
Great July Jones
Well he took his pack from his great strong back
And he said "You lucky girls
I'm here to stay for a year and a day
And I won't be shooting squirrels
So step up now for a howdy-how
Get favors while you can
It's dynamite when I hug you tight
Cause I'm a natural man
Great July Jones, Well Great July Jones
He's got a way they can't resist
He kisses the girls and they stay kissed
Great July Jones
You might also likeWell, he grabbed a girl with a left hand twirl
She looked so mighty cute
But she had fight and used her right
And floored him with a beaut
Now you can't do that to six foot two
You're only five foot one
He jumped a mile but she said with a smile
"You're a boasting son of a gun."
Great July Jones, Well Great July Jones
He's got a way they can't resist
He kisses the girls and they stay kissed
Great July Jones
She stepped right up like a demitasse cup
And he looked into her eyes
His heart went bang and her own heart sang
They stood there in surprise
Well he scratched his head and he smiled and said
"Now you're the champ I guess
And if you're free will you marry me?"
And five foot one said, "Yes."
Great July Jones, Well Great July Jones
He's got a way they can't resist
He kisses the girls and they stay kissed
Great July Jones
