I'm the best darn cowboy ever was born

Well, I started up the trail October twenty-third
Started up the trail with a 2-U herd
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
Up every morning before daylight
And before I sleep the moon shines bright
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
With a ten dollar horse and a forty dollar saddle
I'm going down to Texas for to punch them cattle
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
Well old Ben Bolt was a fine old boss
And he went to see his gal on a sore-back hoss
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
There's a stray in the herd and boss said kill it
So I shot him in the rump with the handle of a skillet
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
And I went to the boss to draw my roll
And he had me figured out nine dollars in the hole
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
Ropin' and a-tyin' and a-brandin' all day
I'm a-working mighty hard for a-mighty little pay
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
Well, I went to the boss and we had a little chat
And I hit him in the face with my old slouch hat
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
With my foot in the stirrup and my hand on the horn
I'm the best danged cowboy ever was born
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yay
Well, I'm gonna get married just as quick as I can
And I won't punch cattle for no darn man
Singing ki yi yippee yippee yi yippeo
