I thought you knew
I've been doing some hard rambling
Way down the road
Hard traveling, hard rambling
Hard drinking, hard gambling
I've been doing some hard traveling, Lord
I've been doing some hard rock mining
I thought you knew
I've been leaning on a pressure drill
Way down the road
Well, the hammer flying
And the air hose sucking
And six feet of mud
I sure been mucking
I've been doing some hard traveling, Lord
I've been working that Pittsburgh steel
I thought you knew
I've been pouring that red-hot slag
Way down the road
I been blasting, I've been firing
I've been pouring red-hot iron
I've been doing some hard traveling Lord
I've been layin' in a hard rock jail
I thought you knew
I've been layin' out ninety days
Way down the road
The darned old judge, he said to me
It's ninety days for vagrancy
And I've been doing some hard traveling, Lord
I've been walking that Lincoln highway
I thought you knew
And I've been hittin' that sixty six
Way down the road
Got a heavy load
Got a worried mind
I'm a' looking for a woman
That's hard to find
And I've been doing some hard traveling, Lord
I've been doing some hard traveling
I've been having some hard rambling
I've been doing some hard traveling
I've been doing some hard traveling, Lord
I've been riding them fast passengers
I thought you knew
I've been hitting them flat wheelers
Way down the road
I've been ridin' them, blind passengers
Dead enders, kickin' up cinders
I've been doing some hard traveling, Lord
I've been doing some hard harvesting
I thought you knew
From North Dakota to Kansas City
Way down the road
Cutting that wheat and
Stacking that hay
Just trying to make 'bout a dollar a day
