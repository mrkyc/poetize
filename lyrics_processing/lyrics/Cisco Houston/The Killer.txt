Through the canyon, in the glow
Of a quiet Sunday morning
From the town of Angelo
Ridin' easy on that pinto
That he dearly loved to straddle
With a six-gun and sombrero
That was wider than his saddle
And he's hummin' as he's goin'
Of a simple little song
That's a-boomin' through the cactus
As he's gallopin' along:
"Oh, I've rid from San Antony
Through the mesquite and the sand
I'm a rarin', flarin' bucko
Not afraid to play my hand
Well, I'm a hootin', shootin' demon
And to have my little fun
On my pinto called Apache
And Adolphus that's my gun."
Well straight to Santa Fe he drifted
And he mills around the town
Sorta gittin' of his bearin's
As he pours his liquor down
But he's watchin', always watchin'
Every hombre in the place
Like he's mebbe sorta lookin'
For some certain hombre's face
You might also likeThen one night he saunters careless
To the place of Monte Sam
And he does a bit of playin'
Like he doesn't give a damn
Then all at once it's hushed and quiet
Like a calm before the blow
And the crowd is tense and nervous
And the playin stopped and slow
At the bar a man is standin'
Sneerin' as his glances lay
Like a challenge did he fling 'em
Darin' 'em to make the play
Two-Gun Blake, the Texas killer
Hated, feared wherever known
Stood and drank his glass of mescal
With assurance all his own
Then the eyes of Blake, the killer
Met the glance of Dobe Bill
And they held each one the other
With the steel of looks that kill
Then the tones of Blake came slowly
With a sneer in every word
"Well, you've found me!"
But the other gave no sign he saw or heard
Walkin' calmly toward the speaker
He advanced with steady pace
Then he grinned, and quick as lightnin'
Slapped him squarely in the face
"Shoot, you snake!" he whispered hoarsely
"Shoot, you lily-livered cur!"
"Draw! You're always strong for killin';
Now I'm here to shoot for her!"
Some there was that claimed they saw it
As the killer tried to draw
But there's no one knows for certain
Just exactly what he saw;
I'll agree the shootin' started
Quick as Blake had made his start
Then a brace of bullets hit him
Fair and certain through the heart
As he fell, his hand was graspin'
For the gun he'd got too late
With the notches on it showin'
Like the vagaries of fate
And the man who stood there lookin'
At the killer as he lay
Murmured: "Nell, I've kept my promise
I have made that scoundrel pay!"
Then Dobe Bill, he went a-ridin'
From the town of Santa Fe
On a quiet Sunday morning
Goin' happy on his way
Ridin' easy on that pinto
That he dearly loved to straddle
With a six-gun and sombrero
That was wider than his saddle
And he's a hummin' as he's goin'
Of a simple little song
That's a-boomin' through the cactus
As he's gallopin' along:
"Oh, I'm goin' down the canyon
Through the mesquite and the sand
I'm a rarin', flarin' bucko
Not afraid to play my hand
Well I'm a rootin', shootin' demon
And I have my little fun
On my pinto called Apache, a-ha
