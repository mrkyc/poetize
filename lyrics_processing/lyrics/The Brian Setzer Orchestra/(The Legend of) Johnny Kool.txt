I had one cup of coffee and a cigarette
Then I rolled out of bed with my shirt soaking wet
If I was gonna get movin', now was the time
So I packed up my bags and my Gretsch '59
It's a tough life, love
But when push comes to shove
It's the only life for Johnny Johnny, Johnny Kool
Played his guitar and he sang like a fool
Don't let the big boys grind you down
Johnny Johnny, Johnny Kool
He was a rebel that broke all the rules
Everyone can't stop talkin' about
The legend of Johnny Kool
It was darker than black, not a star in the sky
So I revved on the engine and let that Mercury fly
With the wind blowin' by at a 105
It gave me a thrill just bein' alive
It's a tough life, love
But when push comes to shove
It's the only life for Johnny Johnny, Johnny Kool
Played his guitar and he sang like a fool
Don't let the big boys grind you down

He was a rebel that broke all the rules
Everyone can't stop talkin' about
The legend of Johnny Kool
Rumor had it now this cat had it all
He was loud, he was wild, and he sure rocked the hall
Some guy grabbed my arm and I jumped on the stage
And I was rockin' with a guy who was twice my age
It's a tough life, love
But when push comes to shove
It's the only life for Johnny Johnny, Johnny Kool
Played his guitar and he sang like a fool
Don't let the big boys grind you down
Johnny Johnny, Johnny Kool
He was a rebel that broke all the rules
Everyone can't stop talkin' about
