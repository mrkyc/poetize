This old house once knew its children
This old house once knew its wife
This old house was home and comfort
As they fought the storms of life
This old house once rang with laughter
This old house heard many shouts
Now it trembles in the darkness
When the lightning walks about
Ain't gonna need this house no longer
Ain't gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the window pane
Ain't gonna need this house no longer
He's getting ready to meet the saints
This old house is gettin' shaky
This old house is gettin' old
This old house has seen the rain
This old house has seen the cold
You might also likeOh his knees are gettin' chilly
But he feels no fear or pain
'Cause he sees an angel peepin'
Through a broken window pane
Ain't gonna need this house no longer
Ain't gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the window pain
Ain't gonna need this house no longer
He's getting ready to meet the saints
This old house is gettin' shaky
This old house is gettin' old
This old house has seen the rain
This old house has seen the cold
Oh his knees are gettin' chilly
But he feels no fear or pain
'Cause he sees an angel peepin'
Through a broken window pane
Ain't gonna need this house no longer
Ain't gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the window pane
Ain't gonna need this house no longer
