She came like
Late spring does sometimes
My heart was taken so
Like December snow
Frozen in the chill of winter time
But now they've taken early April
December's comin' back again
I feel the frosty morn
Now my baby's gone
She just wouldn't leave it well alone
She said kiss me deadly, don't be sweet
Kiss me deadly, knock me off my feet
Kiss me deadly, turn up the heat
Kiss me deadly, kiss me deadly
Kiss me deadly, kiss me deadly
She wore dark glasses
And a black rose
Was it perfume? I couldn't tell
She wouldn't hesitate
She would intoxicate
Any kind of man that came her way
She's not a girl you can hold on to
I got that feeling from the start
But I looked the other way
It's haunting me today
I just couldn't get enough of her
She said kiss me deadly, don't be sweet
Kiss me deadly, knock me off my feet
Kiss me deadly, turn up the heat
Kiss me deadly, kiss me deadly
Kiss me deadly, kiss me deadly

We didn't have too much to say
She had her mind made up
I guess that's my tough luck
Letting my fool heart get in the way
You know I'm kind of glad it's over
That kind of love can last so long
Don't feel too bad for me
Yes, I heard her plea
I kissed her deadly can't you see
That I kissed her deadly, off of her feet
I kissed her deadly, don't be sweet
I kissed her deadly, turned up the heat
Kiss me deadly, don't be sweet
Kiss me deadly, knocked her off her feet
Kiss me deadly, turned up the heat
Kiss me deadly, kiss me deadly
