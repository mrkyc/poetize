I jump into my rocket 'cause I'm ready to blast
I don't know where I'm going but I'm going there fast
Tonight there ain't no future and there isn't a past
We'll make it like the first time so it won't be the last
All I wanna do is everything that you ask
Don't you know I'm really gettin' in the mood
Got the jitter fingers and they're ready to pop
When I get to groovin' ain't no way I can stop
Baby when we get there then we're just gonna hop
Got to ride the feeling baby straight to the top
Girl you make my heart start beatin' flippity-flop
Baby can't you tell I'm getting' in the mood
(In the mood)
The joint is jumpin'
(In the groove)
We're onto something
(In the mood)
The band is pumpin'
Swingin' and swayin' and a-rock and rollin'
Come on now
We're gonna party
(I know how)
Yeah to get it started
(In the mood)
I'm good to boogie
Blow that jiving music now
You might also like(Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby)
And when the party's over
I just know where to go
Where the after hours people
Boogie you know
I wanna hang a while
Where the lights are real low
And whisper to my baby
And be takin' it slow
And baby if you're ready
Then I'm ready to blow
Baby,now I'm really getting
In the mood
(In the mood)
How the joint is jumpin'
(In the groove)
Yeah, we're onto something
(In the mood)
O-o the band is pumpin'
Swingin' and swayin' and a-rock and rollin'
Come on now
Girl, we're gonna party
(I know how)
Yeah to get it started
(In the mood)
Ho ho I'm good to boogie
Blow that jiving music now
I got on my best threads and my favorite shoes
Now it's my time to play got no love for the blues
Understand what I'm sayin' or you better get back
Got no time to waste cause I'm one hep cat
And when I start a-workin' I cruise like Dynaflow
And when I'm in the mood I spread it all around
I might the be man want his party on the run
And when you see me comin' just call me Big King Fun...HAH
When the party's over
I just know where to go
Where the after hours people
Boogie you know
I wanna hang a while
Where the lights are low
And whisper to my baby
And be takin' it slow
Baby if your ready
Then I'm ready to blow
(In the mood)
Yeah the joint is jumpin'
(In the groove)
Girl, we're onto something
(In the mood)
Man, the band is pumpin'
Swingin' and swayin' and a-rock and rollin'
Come on now
Girl, we're gonna party
(I know how)
Yeah to get it started
(In the mood)
Come on! I'm good to boogie
Blow that jiving music now
