Am I real if you can see right through me?
If I'm in a magazine?
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
Am I real if I'm a broken record
Selling you what you don't need?
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
Do you believe it? I don't

Do you ever wonder what we learned?
We can raise our glasses dancing on the ashes as it burns
Have you reached the point of no return?
We can raise our glasses dancing on the ashes as it burns

Is this heaven or is this hell?
Through a silver screen, you're saying what you mean
But I can't tell
Is this heaven or is this hell?
If none of this is real, then show me what you feel
'Cause I can't tell

Is it right if I'm a perfect actress
Playing the princess in distress?
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
Is it alright if I save myself and
If I clean up my own mess?
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
Is it enough yet? 'Cause I've had enough
