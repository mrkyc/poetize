Do you really believe that you can ever be sure?
They're leavin' bodies in stairwells, a-washing up on the shore
Do you really expect us to care what you're waitin' for
When you're high in your castle
Keepin' an eye on the door, the door, the door?

If I only see what I can see
I know it isn't there
And if I only need what I can keep
I know it isn't fair

Oh baby, you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, no, I will stop at nothing now

Do you really believe that you are one of a kind?
If you don't have a heart, I can offer you mine
Do you really expect that you will always be fine
When you're high on your throne, and
Never toein' the line, the line, the line?

If I only see what I can see
I know it isn't there
And if I only need what I can keep
I know it isn't fair

Oh baby, you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, no, I will stop at nothing now

Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
From all that we've done
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
From all that we've done

Oh baby, you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, no, I will stop at nothing now
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
From all that we've done
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
From all that we've done

Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
