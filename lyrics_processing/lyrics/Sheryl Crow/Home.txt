I woke up this mornin'
And now I understand
What it means to give your life
To just one man
Afraid of feelin' nothing
No bees or butterflies
My head is full of voices
And my house is full of lies

This is home
Home
And this is home, home
This is home

I found you standin' there
When I was seventeen
Now I'm thirty-two
And I can't remember what I'd seen in you
And I made a promise
Said it every day
Now I'm reading romance novels
And dreamin' of yesterday

Home
And this is home
And this is home
This is home

I'd like to see the Riviera
And slow dance underneath the stars
I'd like to watch the sun come up
In a stranger's arms

And this is home, oh
And this is home
Home
Home
Home

I'm going crazy
A little every day
And everything I wanted
Is now driving me away
I woke this morning
To the sound of breaking hearts
Mine is full of questions
And it's tearing yours apart
Tearing yours apart

And it's tearing yours apart
Tearing yours apart
