You wanna build your walls
I wanna knock them down
Looking for a heartbeat
But I don't hear a sound

But anything's better than hanging 'round together
Knowing that the other one's through
And honestly, I don't think it's the biggest when we sink
But it's feeling like we're breaking in two

Tell me when it's over (Tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over (Tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over
'Cause I don't wanna be the last to know

And I count the days
But I think our number's up
Is there anyway, oh
To make you feel enough?

And I can see something's changed
Everything's feeling strange
And neither one of us knows why
And I don't wanna face it
We're in a situation where somebody's always saying goodbye
You might also like
Tell me when it's over (Tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over (Tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over
'Cause I don't wanna be

Caught up in a dream (Caught up in a dream)
Ridin' love supreme
But I know it's coming (And I know it's coming)
Yeah, I know it's coming (And I know it's coming, coming)
See it in your face (See it in your face)
You let a good thing go to waste
'Cause you keep on running (Keep on running)
You keep on running away from love

Tell me when it's over (Tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over (Tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over (Oh, tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over (Tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over (Tell me when it's over)
Tell me when it's over (Oh)

Caught up in a dream (Caught up in a dream)
Where I  love supreme
But I know it's coming (And I know it's coming)
Yeah, I know it's coming (And I know it's coming, coming)
See it in your face (See it in your face)
You let a good thing go to waste
'Cause you keep on running (Keep on running)
You keep on running away from love
Hold me in your arms (Hold me in your arms)
Come on, let me feel your heart
Though I know it's coming (And I know it's coming)
Yeah, I know it's coming (And I know it's coming, coming)
See it in your face (See it in your face)
You let a good thing go to waste
'Cause you keep on running (Keep on running)
You keep on running away from love
Keep on running
Keep on running, ooh-ooh
Keep on running
Keep on running
Keep on running
Keep on running
