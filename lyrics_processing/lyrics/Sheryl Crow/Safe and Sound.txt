Maybe this is forever
Forever fades away
Like a rocket ascending into space
Could you not be sad?
Could you not break down?
After all, won't let go

'Til you're safe and sound
'Til you're safe and sound
There's beauty in release
There's no one left to please
But you and me

I don't blame you for quitting
I know you really try
If only you could hang on through the night
'Cause I don't wanna be lonely
I don't wanna be scared
But all our friends are waiting there

Until you're safe and sound
Until you're safe and sound
There's beauty in release
There's no one left to please
But you and me
You might also like
Sound
Until you're safe and sound
Feel like I could've held on
Feel like I could've let go
Feel like I could've helped you
Feel like I could've changed you
(Until you're safe and sound)
Feel like I could've held you
Feel like I could've hurt you
(Until you're safe and sound)
Feel like I was a stranger
Feel like I was an angel
(Until you're safe and sound)
Feel like I was a hero
Feel like I was a zero
(Until you're safe and sound)
Feel like I should've heard you
Feel like I could have healed you
(Until you're safe and sound)
Feel like I could have changed you
Feel like I could've heard you
(Until you're safe and sound)
Feel like I could have healed you
Feel like I should've told you
I feel like I could have loved you (Oh)
I feel like I could have loved you
I feel like I could have loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
I feel like I really loved you
Feel like I could've saved you
Feel like I could've saved you
Feel like I could've saved you
