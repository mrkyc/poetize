You pull up in your Hummer and you park next to my Volt
Wearing Armani three piece, I wear Levi's full of holes
Well, I walk along the left side, and you walk along the right
We're both tryin' to reach the same place
We might not get there on time

But you know what's best
I know what's best
Let's just agree to disagree
And we all know the rest, yeah

Baby, if you dare
If you really care
Baby, if you dare
Won't you meet me halfway there?
Baby, if you care
If you really care
Baby, if you dare
Won't you meet me halfway there?
Yeah

Each and every Sunday morning, you sit in your church pew
I'm sittin' on a mountain, takin' in this glorious view
Well, I know your God is listening, and I know mine must be too
And if God is love and love is godly, why do we argue?
You might also like
I don't know why
But I wanna try
Well, we can listen to each other
Before we criticize, yeah

Baby, if you care
If you really care
Baby, if you dare
Won't you meet me halfway there?
Baby, if you care
If you really care
Baby, if you care
Won't you meet me halfway there?
Woo!

Could you meet me down the river, hash it out over a beer?
Could you smoke from the same peace pipe 'til our anger disappears?
You want respect (Respect)
You just want love (Love)
I want that too, for you, and for me, and everyone, yeah

But you know what's best
And I know what's best
Let's just agree to disagree
And give this thing a rest
Baby, if you care
If you really care
Baby, if you dare
Won't you meet me halfway there?
Baby, if you care
If you really care
Baby, if you dare
Won't you meet me halfway there?
Baby, if you care
If you really care
Baby, if you dare
Won't you meet me halfway there?
Baby, if you care
If you really care
Baby, if you dare
Won't you meet me halfway there?
Uh-huh-huh

Meet in the middle
