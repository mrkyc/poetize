Money is the Bentley parked on Wall Street
Money is the new friends you make each week
Money is the inside guy at the bank
Money is the yacht right before it sank
Bet you never thought you'd want so much
Bet you never thought it'd be so tough
So you sell your soul for a piece of the pie
Now you can't sleep so you don't even try

I wouldn't want to be like you
I wouldn't want to be like you
No way
I wouldn't want to be like you
You tell a lie, you tell a lie, you tell a lie
But that don't make it true

Money is the monkey giving you a back ache
Money is the grease in the palm of a handshake
Money covers up all the evidence
Not taking all the money would have made the best sense
Bet you never thought you'd bleed that much
Bet you never thought it'd be so rough
You thought you could beat them at their game
But they wrote the rules, now you take the blame
You might also like
I wouldn't want to be like you
I wouldn't want to be like you
No way
I wouldn't want to be like you
You tell a lie, you tell a lie, you tell a lie
But that don't make it true

All the players on the sidelines
Feigning shock and innocence
Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Take the fall for all of the place

Money is the orange jumpsuit you're wearing
Money is the gray roots in your blonde hair and
Money is the ex-wife and the ex-girlfriends
Money you hid is the money they're spending
Here's to the brand new diamond bracelet
Here's to the too tight ankle bracelet
Here's to the days before you went down
'Cause what goes around comes around and around

I wouldn't want to be like you
I wouldn't want to be like you
No way
Oh, I wouldn't want to be like you
You tell a lie, you tell a lie, you tell a lie
But that don't make it true
I wouldn't want to be like you
No way
Oh, I wouldn't want to be like you
You tell a lie, you tell a lie, you tell a lie
But that don't make it true
No, that don't make it true
