Slappin' leather was devised
During a wild streak in her life
She has a cheap apartment up on Royal Street
She brought home just enough to keep her on her feet
She don't believe in anything
But it you ask her, she'll say
"There's plenty of things to believe in"

Sometimes you gotta give in
Sweet Rosalyn
Sometimes you gotta give in
Sometimes you gotta be loved

She got a number off the bathroom wall
She was lookin' for a good time, so she made the call
Got a strangely calm voice on the other line
Sneaky little priest trying to reach out to the swine
He said, "Hello, my name is Father Tim
It seems to me your zeal for this life
Has been wearing a little thin"

Sometimes you gotta give in
Sometimes you gotta be loved

Well, maybe we all could use a little grace
To know when to run or when to
Stay in one place
