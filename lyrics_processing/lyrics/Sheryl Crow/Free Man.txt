I sold my house, I sold my car
I took a job at Milly's bar
I met a man who was running from the government

And he wants to be a free man, yeah
Oh, he wants to be a free man, yeah

He took me out to his campsite
I met his friends
They seemed alright
Until I noticed everybody seemed real uptight

They just wanna be a free man now
They just wanna be a free man now
They just wanna be a free man now

Pardon me, man
Oh, but who's your mother
Oh, and didn't she say
You should love one another? Oh

He showed me how to load a piece
To shoot it straight between the teeth
And the next thing I know I think I've fallen in love

And I'm livin' with a free man now
Oh, now I'm cooking for the free man now

He took me out in his old truck
He told me anyone who ain't white sucks
That's when I realized I'd made a big mistake

Oh, I'm running from the free man now
Oh, I'm running from the free man now
Oh, I'm running from the free man now

Oh, but pardon me man
Oh, who's your mother
And didn't she teach you?
She should love one another

Late one night, I snuck away
To use the phone so I could say
I'd appreciate a little bit of government
'Cause I'm married to a free man now
Oh, I'm married to a free man now
Yeah, I'm married to a free man now

Well, I'm married to a free man now
Yeah, I'm married to a free man now
Oh, I'm married to a free man now
I think I'm running from a free man
Running from a free man
Running from a free man now
Oh, I'm running from a free man now
