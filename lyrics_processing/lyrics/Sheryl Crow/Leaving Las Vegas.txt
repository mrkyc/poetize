Life springs eternal
On a gaudy neon street
Not that I care at all
I spent the best part of my losing streak
In an Army Jeep
For what I can't recall
Oh, I'm bangin' on my TV set
And I check the odds
And I, and I place my bet
I pour a drink
And I pull the blinds
I wonder what I'll find

I'm leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat
Blackjack on a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
Leaving for good, for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good

Used to be I could drive up to Barstow for the night
Find some crossroad trucker to demonstrate his might
But these days it seems that, nowhere is far enough away
So I'm leaving Las Vegas today
You might also like
I'm leaving Las Vegas, oh
The lights so bright
Blackjack on a Saturday night
I'm leaving Las Vegas
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good
For good

I'm standin' in the middle of the desert
Waitin' for my ship to come in
But now no joker, no jack, no king
Can take this losing hand and, and make it win

I'm leaving Las Vegas, oh
I'm leaving Las Vegas
For good
For good

I quit my job as a dancer
At the Lido des Girls
And they're dealin' blackjack until one or two
Such a muddy line between the things you want
And the things you have to do, oh
Leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat
Blackjack on a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good
Oh, I'm leaving Las Vegas
The lights so bright
Palms sweat
Blackjack on a Saturday night
I'm leaving Las Vegas
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good
Oh, I'm leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
On a Saturday night

Leaving Las Vegas
And I won't be back
No, no
No, I won't be back
