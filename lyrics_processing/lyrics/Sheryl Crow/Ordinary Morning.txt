I left a man
Asleep in the nude
Name in my pocket
With lipstick and rouge
Everything I ever wanted
What a lovely pie you baked
Is anybody listening?
Why the painted bird never flies away

It's just an ordinary morning
It's just an ordinary day
And I'm just an ordinary woman
Slipping away

The walls have been talking
About me again
I'm good for a joke, but when I awoke
The dream didn't end
Now every time I turn around, I'm only sleepin'
John, is anybody out there?
And the wounded birds still sing

Oh, it's just an ordinary morning
It's just an ordinary day
And I'm just an ordinary woman
Slipping away
Oh, it's just an ordinary morning
It's just an ordinary day
And I'm just an ordinary woman
Slipping away

Don't you wanna slip away?
Oh now, don't you wanna slip away?
I say now
Don't you wanna
Don't you wanna
Don't you wanna
Don't you wanna slip away?
