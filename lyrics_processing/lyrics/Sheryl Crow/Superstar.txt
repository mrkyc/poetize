Let's all go downtown
I got friends doing nothing but hanging around
Well, I feel like there's something I could be missing
You know you look alright
You got cheap shoes, a Malibu, and big public fights
Well, there's no one else I would rather be kissin'

And baby, when you start to bleed, you look so sweet
Everybody's watching you, 'cause everybody wants to be

Little superstar
Yeah, baby, that's what you are
Little superstar
Oh honey, that's what you are

I got a backstage line
I call you up, been watching you for quite some time
Well, I beat around the streets like Bandini looking for Camilla
Well, I'll be satin and speed
And you and I are still alive, we'll get off these streets
Well, there was a time I would've hung around just to be seen
