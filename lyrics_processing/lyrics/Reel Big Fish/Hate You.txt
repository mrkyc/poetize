Hey now everybody
Look who's on TV
Look who just got famous
Don't you know
It
Should have been
(Me)
I'm not really bitter
I'm not really mad
I love to see other people get
Everything I ever
Wanted to have
I don't really care
How big they get
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
Why can't I be cool like them?
You might also likeI used to have a girlfriend
I treated her so bad
She went out and
Found another lead singer
Maybe she just likes guys in bands
I give up on everything
All my dreams are dead
Maybe I'll get a shotgun and
Try to blow her right out of my head
Everybody says
"How come you ain't made it yet?"
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
Why can't I get my girl back?
I knew you wouldn't understand
(No, no no)
Just what I'm tryin' to do
(No, no no)
Cause you're not fuckin' me
And I'm so glad
That I'm not fuckin'
You
I know it's my problem
There's nothing I can do
But I don't think there is no reason
I don't think there's no excuse for you
Well I've learned my lesson
I hope you've learned it too
And if they're gonna go and do it to me, well
I guess I'm gonna have to go and do it to you
I don't really care, how much you cry
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
