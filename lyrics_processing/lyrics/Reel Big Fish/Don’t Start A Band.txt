Don't start a band
Nobody wants to hear
Nobody understands
Don't start a band
You'll be so disappointed
That it was nothing like you planned
Don't start a band
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I hate to ruin the magic
I hate to kill the dream
But once you've been behind the scenes
Well, you'll know just what I mean
You might think that's its cool to get up on the stage
And play rock and roll with your heart and soul
But no one shows up and your songs all suck
And there's no applause and no flying bras
No girls will scream for you
And no ones gonna sing along with you

Don't start a band
Nobody wants to hear
Nobody understands
Don't start a band
You will be so damn terrible
They'll all think you're shitty and bland
Don't start a band
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you won't get paid
And you won't get laid
Yeah, yeah
You might also like
And even if you make it
All the way to MTV
I don't think you could take it
All the bullshit and the greed
Everyone is so fake when they shake you hand
And they kiss your ass 'cause they're makin' cash
And the business end will turn every friend
To an enemy oh you will see
They'll turn their backs and they'll be gone
Faster than can say "What did I do wrong?"

Don't start a band
Nobody really cares
Nobody understands
Don't start a band
You will sign your life away
And then you will be working for the man
Don't start a band
Oh yea yea yea
Your message will get lost
You will be double crossed
Alright!

And if you think that the joy of playing
Will keep you going through the years
Wait till you're poor and frustrated
And the fun just disappears
Nobody cares what you have to say
And no one's gonna listen anyway
Rock and roll will bring you down
And it will kick you while you're on the ground
Don't start a band
Don't even try, you will regret it, yeah
Don't start a band
You will be so disappointed
That it was nothing like you planned
Don't start a band
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
So just give up now
I'll show you how

Don't start a band
Don't start a band
Don't start a band
