You got me pissed off, you got me pissed off
You got me pissed off, you're gonna regret it
You got me pissed off, you got me pissed off
You got me pissed off, you're gonna regret it

You're a sneak, a cheat, a liar, and a fake
Every time you flap your gums, you're lyin' to my face
Stealin' every single fuckin' thing that isn't nailed down
You're a bullshit artist and nobody wants you around

You got me pissed off, you got me pissed off
You got me pissed off, you're gonna regret it
You got me pissed off, you got me pissed off
You got me pissed off, you're gonna regret it

The time is now and the judgment has come
It's time to pay for all the evil things that you have done
What's gone around has come back around to punish you
For all the wrongs that you couldn't help but go and do

You got me pissed off, you got me pissed off
You got me pissed off, you're gonna regret it
You got me pissed off, you got me pissed off
You got me pissed off, you're gonna regret it
