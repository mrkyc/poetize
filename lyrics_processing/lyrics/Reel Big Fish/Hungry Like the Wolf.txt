Now, if you will, gentlmen, let's, let's put it, the song into perspective, just so you guys can understand where I'm coming from when I sings this. It's that the, the, the, the woman is, is the hunted, the animal, and when I catch her, being the predator, the hunter, I'm gonna kill her. Maybe not kill her, but, you know. You know what I mean, you silly guys, little bit of hot nookie, yeah? Little bit of pinch and squeal? Whatever, you know, however it goes. We're animals, right? We're outta control. We're fierce, animals, crazy, rrr. That's what I'm sayin'. Let's do this song
Dark in the city and the night is a wire
Steam in the subway and the earth is afire, oh yeah
Woman, you want me, so give me a sign
Other way, I'm just a moment behind, oh yeah
Now, in touch with the ground
I'm on a hunt, I'm after you
Smell like a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
My mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Dark in the forest, and it's too close to hide
I'll be upon you on the moonlight side, oh yeah
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind, oh yeah, alright now
In touch with the ground
I'm on a hunt, I'm after you
Smell like a sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
I straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
My mouth is alive and running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf
You might also likeHungry like the wolf
Like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
In touch with the ground
I'm on a hunt, I'm after you
Smell like a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
My mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Smell like a sound, in touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Smell like a sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
My mouth is alive and running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf
I'm hungry like the wolf
Oh yeah, I'm hungry, hungry like the wolf
I'm hungry, baby
Like the wolf, baby, like the wolf
Was that too much?
