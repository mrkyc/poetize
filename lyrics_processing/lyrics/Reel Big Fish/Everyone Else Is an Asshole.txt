Woahh Wa-ohhh, Wa-ohhh-ohh-ohh
I tried to be nice
I tried to live my life
But everyone else is an asshole
I tried to forgive
I tried to live and let live
But everyone else is an asshole
And everybody else thinks of no one but themselves
And no one wants to help cause they're all assholes
And every friendly chat is a knife in the back
A sneaky attack waiting to happen
I tried not to mind
I tried to be so kind
But everyone else is an asshole
I tried to let love rule
But I feel like such a fool
Cause everyone else is an asshole
And they're out there even now
Trying to mess me up somehow
But they won't stop me now
Cause they're all assholes
You might also likeAnd they're planning while I sleep
And even as we speak
To strike when I am weak
Cause they're all assholes
Everyone else
Everyone else
Everyone else is an asshole
Everyone else
Everyone else
Everyone else is an asshole
It's time to defend
I know I have no friends
Everyone else is an asshole
I've got to get them first
Cause worst has come to worst
Everyone else is an asshole
But they put the blame on me
Pretending not to see
That I just want to be free
From these assholes
But I couldn't take their shit
So I tried to deal with it
And now I look a bit
Like an asshole!
I tried to be nice
I tried to live my life
But everyone else is an asshole
I tried to overlook
And I tried to close the book
But everyone else is an asshole
I tried not to talk shit
But I just couldn't help it
Everyone else is an asshole
They called it assault
But it really wasn't my fault
Everyone else is an asshole
Everyone else
Everyone else
Everyone else is an asshole
Everyone else
Everyone else
Everyone else is an asshole
You're an asshole too!
You're an asshole too!
I'm talking bout you
I'm talking bout you
I'm talking bout you, and you, and you
You're an asshole too
I'm talking bout you, and you, and you
You're an asshole too
I'm talking bout you, and you, and you
