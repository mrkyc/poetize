That you were crazed, but I'd never forget you
Well I've seen them come, and I've seen them go as fast
But I knew this nightmare was one that was gonna last
I wanna let you go
I gotta let you go
Why can't I just get over you
You hurt me so bad with all the things you do
And I try so hard, but I can't give it up
I love you so much but I think you suck
I gotta say, I never thought this would be such a mess
Things always change, but this time it changed too much I guess
But I know the truth, even though I lied to myself so well
But this was such a good, good thing, but you took it and you made it hell
I wanna let you go
I gotta let you go
Why can't I just get over you
You hurt me so bad with all the things you do
And I try so hard, but I can't give it up
I love you so much but I think you suck
You might also likeI know you don't care for me
And I know you're not there for me
I gotta find a way but I don't know how
I gotta cheer up and get myself out
I gotta get away, I gotta get away
You drive me insane and you make me wanna say
I gotta let you go
I wanna let you go
Why can't I just get
I know I gotta get over you
So many little things that I could do
And I've tried, and I've tried, but it's just no use
Now what am I supposed to do?
Why can't I just get over you
You hurt me so bad with all the things you do
And I try so hard, but I can't give it up
I love you so much but I think you suck
