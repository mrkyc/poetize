Let's all get on the dance floor, it's not gonna be alright
Let's all get on the dance floor 'cause the world's gonna end tonight
They're saying things are worse than they've ever been
It looks like the bad guys are gonna win
And nobody here is gettin' out alive
So I know what I wanna do tonight

Life sucks, so let's dance
Life sucks, so let's dance
Yeah, maybe if we have some fun, we won't feel so bad
Life sucks, so let's dance
Life sucks, so let's dance
Yeah, maybe if we have some fun, we won't feel so bad
Let's dance

Well, I've been waking up early in the morning lately
Going down the list of all the people that hate me
What did I do so wrong?
How come all of my friends are gone, gone, gone?
And why can't we all just get along?
We're all different notes, but we're in the same song

Life sucks, so let's dance
Life sucks, so let's dance
Yeah, maybe if we have some fun, we won't feel so bad

Let's all get on the dance floor, it's all gonna be alright
Let's all get on the dance floor 'cause we're not givin' up the fight
They're saying things are worse than they've ever been
It looks like the bad guys are gonna win
And nobody here is gettin' out alive
So let's have some fun before we die
(Let's have some fun before we die)

Life sucks, so let's dance
Life sucks, so let's dance
Yeah, maybe if we have some fun, we won't feel so bad
Life sucks (Life sucks), so let's dance (Let's dance)
Life sucks (Life sucks), so let's dance
Yeah, maybe if we have some fun, maybe if we have some fun
Maybe if we have some fun, we won't feel so bad
Maybe if we have some fun, we won't feel so bad
