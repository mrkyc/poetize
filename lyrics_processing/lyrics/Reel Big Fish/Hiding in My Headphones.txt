I'm dancing to the beat in my head
I'm dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
I'm dancing to the beat in my head
I'm hiding in my headphones
(Hiding in my headphones!)
Gonna turn them up so loud
Gonna drown this whole world out
I'm hiding in my headphones
(Hiding in my headphones!)
And everyone can see
That they won't bother me
So get
Out of
My way
'Cause I don't
Care what
You have to say
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!
You might also likeI wake up in the morning, turn me house key
Step into the big old world around me
And I hate the fuss of fighting, ya see
Hiding in my headphones where ya find me
Hey mister, I don't mean to be rude
But it's too early to have an attitude
So I... turn up the volume, take a journey
Hiding in my headphones, that's where I'll be
No wanna hear the chatter of the business man
No wanna hear the jingle of the ice cream van
No wanna hear the flappin' in the pigeon coops
Not even wanna listen to the mornin' news
Just dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
I'm hiding in my headphones
(Hiding in my headphones!)
Gonna turn them up so loud
Gonna drown this whole world out
I'm hiding in my headphones
(Hiding in my headphones!)
And everyone can see
That they won't bother me
So get
Out of
My way
'Cause I don't
Care what
You have to say
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!
Here's fingers for you
Here's fingers for you
Just flash your damn light
And blow your horn too
Here's fingers for you
Here's fingers for you
When you see me not looking
Know just what you can do
This one's for the guy dropping girls off to sling some shit (?)
He's got the price, who's got the stuff, oh I might have it (?)
I'm in my mind and I'm trying to listen to music (?)
They call my roaming in the lane try not to crash it (?)
Tempo is the beat and beats are my feet
Bouncing like a drum across the concrete
People in the city look so intense
I can see them talking but they make no sense
And I hate the fuss of fighting, ya see
Hiding in my headphones where ya find me
Hey mister, I don't mean to insult
But to make small talk would be difficult
So I... turn up the volume, take a journey
Hiding in my headphones, that's where I'll be
No wanna hear the beeping of the taxi horn
No wanna hear the busker playing saxophone
No wanna hear the fellow holding out the paper
Not even wanna 'ear a 'ello from me neighbor
Just dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
Dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
I'm hiding in my headphones
(Hiding in my headphones!)
Gonna turn them up so loud
Gonna drown this whole world out
I'm hiding in my headphones
(Hiding in my headphones!)
And everyone can see
That they won't bother me
So get
Out of
My way
'Cause I don't
Care what
You have to say
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!
Here's fingers for you
Here's fingers for you
Just flash your damn light
And blow your horn too
Here's fingers for you
Here's fingers for you
When you see me not looking
Know just what you can do
Now if you're looking for trouble
You'll get it on the double
You don't know who you're dealing with
I'm a rude boy from out of the town
Dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
Dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
Just dancing to the beat in my head
Dancing to the beat in my head, in my head
