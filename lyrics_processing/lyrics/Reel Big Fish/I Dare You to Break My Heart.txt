I know there's something wrong
I don't even know you yet
But I know what you want to do to me
My latest dream girl
My latest nightmare
Could this be the start of another
Long, long, hateful love-affair?
I gotta tell you now
I just cannot allow
Anyone else inside my head
You know I'd rather just drop dead
Well I have cried
As much as I can cry
So just give it a try
And I have bled
As much as I can bleed
No one can hurt me anymore
So I dare you to break my heart
Come on and give me your best shot
Baby, I dare you to break my heart
It's gonna take more than you got
Woah yeah, so go ahead and try to break my heart
Cause I've been working hard this time
Just getting it hard for you
I dare you
You might also likeHey, now I think you're great
And, maybe we could date?
We could go out drinking
Have ourselves a beer and stay out late
But I got a heart of stone
Covered by brick and bone
If you think you're gonna get close to it
Well I think you better just get gone
Don't try to tame me now
You'll never slow me down
I'm just gonna get up
Gonna get right back up and get around
Well I have bled
As much as I can bleed
You'll see what I mean
And I have cried
As much as I can cry
No one can hurt me anymore
And so I dare you to break my heart
Come on and give it your best shot
Baby, I dare you to break my heart
It's gonna take more than you got
Woah yeah, so go ahead and try to break my heart
Cause I've been working hard this time
Just getting it hard for you
I dare you
Woah yeah!
The harder that you try
The harder you fail
The river that you cry
Is where I'm gonna
Woah set sail!
Come on, break it!
When all is said and done
And we have had our fun
You won't have your chains on me
You won't claim me as your only one
I've got one thing to say
As I push you far away
Do you think someone like you
Could make someone like me love you anyway?
The most important thing
That I have ever learnt
Is if you're not doing the hurting
You're the one who's getting hurt
Woah yeah
Well I have cried
As much as I can cry
Just give it a try
And I have bled
As much as I can bleed, baby
No one can hurt me anymore
And so I dare you to break my heart
Come on and give it your best shot
Baby, I dare you to break my heart
It's gonna take more than you got
Oh yeah, I dare you to break my heart
Come on and give it your best shot
Baby, I dare you to break my heart
It's gonna take more than you got
Woah yeah, so go ahead and try to break my heart
Cause I've been working hard this time
And I've been working hard this time
Yeah, I've been working hard this time
Just getting it hard for
Getting it hard for
Getting it hard for you
