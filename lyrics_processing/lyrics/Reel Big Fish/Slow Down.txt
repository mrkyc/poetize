Take it easy, oh yeah
Well, you've been racing around
And your blood's flowing fast
And your heart starts to pound
Yeah, you've been shaking the trees
But no answers fall out
It's just birds' nests and leaves
You told that son of a bitch
To get out of this place
Or you're punching his face
You threw the telephone down
When the bad news came
And then it stuck around
You've got to make it stop
And find a way to make that
Pressure drop, so...
Slow down

Take it easy
Slow down

Take it easy, oh yeah

Such a pain in the ass

But they had you convinced
