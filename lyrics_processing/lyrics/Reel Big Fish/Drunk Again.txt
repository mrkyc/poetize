"Ohhh oh ohh! Maybe you should sing a song."
If I had a dollar bill for every
Time I've been wrong
I'd be a self-made millionaire
And you'd still be gone
So hand me down my best dress shoes
And my best dress shirt
'Cause I'm going out in style
To cover the hurt
All I wanna do all day
Is spend it in bed
But that's bad for the body
And even worse for my head
So I'll try and find a place where no one will
Ask me a thing
It'll help me to forget
And help me to sing
'Cause now, I'm drunk again
The means to my end
And I'm scared of myself
'Cause now, it's all the same
The faces and names
And I'm scared of myself again
You might also likeHave you ever wanted to wake up
From your dreaming
It scared you so bad you couldn't control
Your heart or your breathing
Well, walk out the door with me on the floor
You don't care how I'm feeling
I guess a weak and tired and frightened man
Is no longer appealing
'Cause now, I'm drunk again
The means to my end
And I'm scared of myself
'Cause now, it's all the same
The faces and names
And I'm scared of myself again
Some people have a gift of reaching right
Into your soul
And finding the hole
And making it bigger
Baby, sometimes I think I catch you cracking
Cynical smiles
And in a short while
You'll be my heart's gravedigger
Well, there's not much I can do
'Cause I'm at the mercy of you
So, baby, I guess we're through
'Cause now, I'm drunk again
The means to my end
And I'm scared of myself
'Cause now, it's all the same
The faces and names
And I'm scared of myself
'Cause now, it's all the same
The faces and names
And I'm scared of myself
So go, walk out the door
You don't believe me no more
And I'm scared of myself again
If I had a dollar bill for every
Time I've been wrong
I'd be a self-made millionaire
