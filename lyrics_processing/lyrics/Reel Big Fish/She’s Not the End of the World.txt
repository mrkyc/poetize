Punch me in the face
Gash out my eyes
Twist off my arm
And make me realize that
She's not the end of the world
You might also likeThrow me down the stairs
Hit me with a pipe
Stomp out my brains
And make me realize that
She's not the end of the world
But how can I eat
How can I breathe
How can I sleep if she's not with me
Oh, she feels like the end of the world
She's makin' a list
And checkin' it twice
If I'm not on it then what's your advice
Tell me she's not the end of the world
It's happened before
And it's happenin' again
So slit my throat if you're really my friend
Tell me she's not the end of the world
But why do I think
Why do I try
What if I drink myself til I die
Oh she feels like the end of the world

I guess there's something in her eyes
Like Armageddon coming with the red sunrise
And if I had a dying wish
I wish those massive missiles had missed
And I'd blow my heart just like Big Ben's
She's got an apocalyptic head
Punch me in the face
Gash out my eyes
Twist off my arm
And make me realize that
She's not the end of the world
Throw me down the stairs
Hit me with a pipe
Stomp out my brains
And make me realize that
She's not the end of the world
But why do I think
Why do I try
What if I drink myself til I die
Oh she feels like the end of the world
And it's startin' all over again
So if you're really my friend
You'll put a rope around my neck
And you'll hang me right overhead
She feels like the end
She must be the end
Oh she is the end of the world
