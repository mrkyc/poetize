Lose your phone, lose your tone, lose your patience
(We're fine like that, we're fine like that)
Just drop it, pick some other topic
I'm at home, I'm alone with the others
(We're fine like that, we're fine like that)
Just stop it, pick some other logic
Gave it home, no phone, no logic
(We're fine like that, we're fine like that)
Hold me back, remind me of a time when I felt alive
(Just like that, just like that)
Help me up, remind me of a time when I fell in line
(Just like that, just like that)
You lift me up and up
Up and off the floor
You lift me up and up
I dragged you down before
You lift me up and up
There's bound to be one more
I know enough's enough
So what, so what
You lift me up and up
Game changer, here's the rearranger
On safari, in the city with a stranger
(We're fine like that, we're fine like that)
Game over, where should I be closer
Take your time, get in line, taking orders
(We're fine like that)
Maybe come here yourself
Maybe you won't
(Just like that, just like that)
If you could hear yourself
Maybe you don't
(Just like that, just like that)
You lift me up and up
Up and off the floor
You lift me up and up
I dragged you down before
You lift me up and up
There's bound to be one more
I know enough's enough
So what, so what
You lift me up and up
Up and off the floor
You lift me up and up
I dragged you down before
You lift me up and up
There's bound to be one more
I know enough's enough
So what, so what
You lift me up and up
(Just like that x7)
Hold me back, remind me of a time when I felt alive
Help me up, remind me of a time when I fell in line
You lift me up and up
Up and off the floor
You lift me up and up
I dragged you down before
You lift me up and up
There's bound to be one more
I know enough's enough
So what, so what
You lift me up and up
Up and off the floor
You lift me up and up
I dragged you down before
You lift me up and up
There's bound to be one more
I know enough's enough
So what, so what
