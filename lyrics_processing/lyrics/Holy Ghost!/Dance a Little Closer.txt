I feel right
Standing in this room with you
Turn down the houselights
And the chorus doesn't come too soon
Let's make it dumb
But not dumb like a couple fighting
More like a couple when they young and just begun
This night is almost done

I feel good
Just dancing in this room with you
Turn down the houselights
And the chorus doesn't come too soon, oh

And there'll be no big changes
And there'll be no big top line
And there'll be no big changes
There'll be no asinine punch lines
Okay once

C'mon and dance
Dance a little closer
Dance
Dance until it's over
Come on and
Dance
Dance until it's closer
Dance
Uh, until it's over
You might also like
I feel like
Just standing in this room with you
They cut the lights off
The chorus doesn't come too soon

And to my right
Let me introduce the kid with tracks
You see after that ball
We don't need reason at all
To make each other laugh
And that's the happy fact

So put your hands up
But not like a couple fighting
More like a couple when they young and just begun
The night is almost done

C'mon and
Dance
Dance a little closer
Dance
Dance until it's over
Come on and
Dance
Dance until it's closer
Until we forget who you are
Dance
Oh, until it's over

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
And they'll be no big changes
And they'll be no big talkin 'bout
Doo doo do-doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

C'mon and dance
Dance until it's over
Dance
Dancer until it's over
Come on and
Dance
Dance until it's closer
Until you forget who we are
Dance
