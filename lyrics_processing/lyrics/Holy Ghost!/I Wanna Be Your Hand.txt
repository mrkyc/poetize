Firing up the canyons
On the dawn of New Year's Day
Never quite buried the hatchet
Or unearthed a better way
But running out the clock
Running out the clock
Never was the way we played the game
All the way up the canyons
On the dawn of New Years Day

Well even if I tried to change the topic
It's the only one I got
You tell me all the time I've got to drop it
And I try to make you understand

I wanna be your hand
Running through your hair as you're sitting there
Laying in the sand
I wanna be your hand again
I wanna be your hand

Hear the echo of the song they played
When the year was finally dead
Watched the ball as it falls to the floor
Like an ember in descent
You might also like
Well even if I tried to change the topic
It's the only one I got
They tell me all the time I've got to drop it
And I try but I can't stop

People say we're running out the clock
Running out the clock
But that's not the way we played the game
People say we're running out the clock
Running out the clock
But I try to make them understand

I wanna be your hand
Running through your hair as you're sitting there
Laying in the sand
I wanna be your hand again
I wanna be your hand
I wanna be your hand
Running through your hair as you're sitting there
Laying in the sand
I wanna be your hand again
I wanna be your hand
Running out the clock
Running out the clock
Run it out
Running out the clock
Running out the clock
Run it out
Running out the clock
Running out the clock
Run it out
Running out the clock
Running out the clock
Run it out

I wanna be your hand
Running through your hair as you're sitting there
Laying in the sand
I wanna be your hand again
