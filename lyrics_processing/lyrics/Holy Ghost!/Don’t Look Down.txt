Wherever you're walking, whoever you're talking to
I'm right there beside you, even when I'm gone
Wherever you're breathing, whoever you're sleeping with
I know you get lost, I'm always around
Like satellite sounds
When you're lost and not proud

Don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't)

Wherever you're walking, whoever you're talking to
I'm right there beside you, even when I'm gone
Whoever you're calling, wherever you're falling it's okay
I'm right there beside you, when the night is long

Wherever you're driving, whoever you're flying to
I'm right there behind you, I'm around
Cause I'm always around
Like satellite sounds
When you're lost and not grounded
You might also like
Don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't)

Whatever I'm missing, wherever you're living now
I'm right there beside you, even when I'm gone
If you feel like you're dead and alone
If you're still feeling chilled to the bone
Then just close those eyes and I'm home

What if I don't? What if I won't?
What if you need me?
What if I try? What if I lie?
What if I'm bleeding?

I'm always around
Like satellite sounds
When you're lost and I've found you

Don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't)
I'm always around
Like satellite sounds
When you're lost and I've found you

Don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't)

You've fallen up against the tide
It got too rough, all jokes aside
You've fallen down, you lost your way
You started out with every day
You've fallen up against the tide
It got too rough, all joking aside
Started out, you're losing ground
You lost your way

Don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Just don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Just don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't look down
(Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
