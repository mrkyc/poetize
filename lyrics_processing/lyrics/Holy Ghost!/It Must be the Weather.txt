Laying here in my bed, a film playing in my head, it's gonna need a change
It must be the weather
Sounds like something I said, yeah go ahead take and that bet, I think about my age
I can not get better
Waking with the nervous sun set, my hands are shaking 'cos I can't get enough rest, I think I want a change
It must be the weather
And you can chalk it up to cheese, and you can walk it off it seems, I play against my own team
I can not get better

I call, I call my guy and say
"Have you got new moves?"
He says "yeah dude the rumors true"
I fall, I fall back down the stairs
Into my favorite place
I'm sorry but I think this fever's gonna break

It must be the weather
It must be the weather
It must be the weather
It must be the weather
But I think this fever's gonna break

Sitting here in my bed, here comes a voice from the TV set "Hey kid you need a change"
It must be the weather
Time to start making a mends, just me without my friends, irrelevant and lame
I can not get better
And hope is an understudy waiting in the wings of the stage that was built on a whim in the dead of the night
It must be the weather
And you can chalk it up to cheese, and if so then seems 
I can not get better, not ever

It must be the weather (the violence inside me it grows)
It must be the weather (the violence inside makes me choke)
It must be the weather (it time that I finally let go)
It must be the weather
But I think this fever's gonna break
It must be the weather (the violence inside me it grows)
It must be the weather (the violence it finally shows)
It must be the weather (it's time that I finally let go)
It must be the weather

Tell me what to do 'cos I don't know how
Sitting in my room with the sun blocked out
Turn it up louder 'cos I like it loud
Violence in my heart comes out my mouth
Holding onto nothing just as fast as I can
Tell me what to do, tell me whats the plan
Holding onto nothing, I'm holding onto nothing, I'm holding onto nothing just as fast as I can

It must be the weather
It must be the weather
It must be the weather
It must be the weather
