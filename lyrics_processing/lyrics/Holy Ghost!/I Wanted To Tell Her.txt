I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes
I wanted to tell her but I stuck to my lies
I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes
I wanted to tell her
I needed to tell her
Just like the wind you blew away a happy lover's touch
You bring the blues into my heart just like a rush
I cannot bear the way my heart has helped to keep you close
Of you my babe I cannot get enough
You touch me baby
Don't be mean to me
I looked into the lines of lies you told when I asked her name
I knew the perfume in your hair just wasn't mine
Did you ever think to notice babe when you wasn't home?
I noticed every time
I wanted to tell her but I stuck to my lies
I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes
I wanted to tell her but I stuck to my lies
I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes
I wanted to tell her
I needed to tell her
Thought you noticed every time but you didn't notice a thing
I'd have to cover up my calls when the telephone would ring
I'm tired of you and the things you do and all the things you say
No more babysitting for neurotic girls today
You think the pain I'm going through just to keep you babe
Is something that I should bear
Did you ever stop to notice boy when you had nothing?
And I never cared?
I don't want to be sad
You broke my heart
You made me cry today
You been playing around
I know you're leaving me
There's nothing I could say
I'm not changing my mind
The time has come
Now I can have some fun
I'm not sitting around wishing for you to come in out of the sun
You're so mean to me baby
You're so mean to me
I wanted to tell her but I stuck to my lies
I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes
I wanted to tell her but I stuck to my lies
I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes
I wanted to tell her
