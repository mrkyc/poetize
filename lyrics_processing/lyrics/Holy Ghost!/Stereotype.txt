Drop in the car
Let's take the long way
Shot in the dark, through the park
Didn't I catch your name?
Dropping the shock
I wasn't always
Playing a part, at the start

(Wanna show you're it)
If you're around
Can you cue me with the red light
(Tag, you're it)
Is this your life?
Can you tell me who's the new king of playing that

Stereotype, Stereotypically
I always think I'm right, yeah I know
I'm a stereotype, don't be so critical
I typically don't let it show
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
You might also like
Rather discuss
It's the new age
Catching it up, everyone smart
But the words are the same
While it's hot
It's a new phase
Doubling as white, up on the sight

(Wanna show you're it)
If you're around
Can you cue me with the red light
(Tag, you're it)
Is this your life?
Can you cue me when the time is right
(Wanna show you're it)
Is this your life?
Can you cue me with the red light
(Tag, you're it)
Are you around?
Can you tell me who's the new king of playing that

Stereotype, Stereotypically
I always think I'm right, yeah I know
I'm a stereotype, don't be so critical
I typically don't let it show
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)

I heard the worst was over
I read that cash was dead
Just hold yourself on closer
Now slightly turn your head
I heard the worst was over
I read that cash was dead
Just hold yourself on closer
Now slightly turn your head


I heard the worst was over
I've read, the rest I know
Just hold the whole thing closer
Now time to let it show

Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
Let go (3x)
