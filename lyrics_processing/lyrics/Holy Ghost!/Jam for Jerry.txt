You took the stairs downstairs from the third floor
You thought about her as you walked
Well did the sky open up above you in the dark
And what a note to leave with rent
Did you know what's coming or even half know it when you left
You set the tempo, set the pace
From the top, from the start, never slightly late
Just that afternoon we talked
Getting out, stepping out, let it out, something got caught
What about the time I heard you say
Were you only joking, or only half joking when you left
I get the feeling I've done
Something half wrong
It surrounds me and drowns me in it
If I could change it all I would
If only I could
You can quote me and hold me to it
We dropped our records at the scene
Writing numbers on our hands, out of batteries
Called the cops, called the car
Call a friend, call a relative still in the dark

Call ahead to check in call ahead to ask them where they're at
I get the feeling I've done
Something half wrong
It surrounds me and drowns me in it
If I could change it all I would
If only I could
You can quote me and hold me to it
I get the feeling I've done
Something half wrong
It surrounds me and drowns me in it
If I could change it all I would
If only I could
You can quote me and hold me to it
You can quote me and hold me
You can quote me
You can quote me
You can quote me
You can quote
You can quote
You can hold me
You can hold me
You can hold me
You can hold can hold me
I get the feeling I've done
Something half wrong
It surrounds me and drowns me in it
If I could change it all I would
If only I could
