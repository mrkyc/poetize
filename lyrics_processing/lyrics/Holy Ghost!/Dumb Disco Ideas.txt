Cruel summer like no other
I thought you'd throw the first punch by now
I need water, we need water
I need something just to wash this down with

Open the shutters to let the light out
Paintin' by numbers, and it's going south
I need thunder, we need thunder
I need something for my summer drought

Shake it off, shake it off
Don't let that big idea go to waste now
Shake it off, shake it off
Come on, come on, there's no time to waste now

Cruel summer for cruel lovers
This bodega's got a club in the basement
I need water, we need water
I share a taxi with a local native

Waiting on the paycheck, playing on a big set
Paintin' by numbers, and it's going south
I need water, I need water
I need something for my summer drought

Put it off, put it off
Can be tomorrow what you can't today
Put it off, put it off
I drop the needle and the record says...


Cruel summer for fools somewhere
Double down while the market's hot
I need contact, I need contact
Undercovers on the edge of the block

Waiting on the paycheck, playing on a big set
Not everything I think comes out of mouth
I need another, I need another
Just give me something for my summer drought

Put it off, put it off
Can be tomorrow what you can't today
Put it off, put it off
I drop the needle and the record says...
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


Put it off and off
Put it off, and off, and wait, and wait for another day
Put it off, at least for another day!
Put it off, and off, and wait, and wait for another day
Put it off, at least for another day!
Put it off, and off, and wait, and wait for another day
Put it off, at least for another day!
Put it off, and off, and wait, and wait for another day
Put it off, at least for another day!
Put it off, and off, and wait, and wait for another day
Put it off, at least for another day!
Put it off, and off, and wait, and wait for another day
Put it off, at least for another day!
Put it off, and off, and wait, and wait for another day
