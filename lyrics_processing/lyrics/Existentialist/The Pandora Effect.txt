Know you chose death
Eradication of human kind
Generations laid to rest by the greedy and power obsessed
Where are your leaders whilst you stand alone
Forced to kill your own kind for nothing more than
A broken throne
Why do you continue these atrocious sanctioned slaughters
Swords, then gas, then atom bombs
Your history is built on murder
March to the front, the dead won't haunt
Flesh eating parasites fall from the skies
The governors who presided it
Are worshipped for their bullshit
No honour for your country
Because your country's run by sycophants
The melted skin of friends spread thick
Like oil on a canvass
The rancid stench of decay
Caresses their nostrils to this day
The atmosphere fills up with methane
Gasses are released from accelerated decay
All organic matter eaten by the virus
Reduced to heaps of putrid meat
You might also likeA single spark now ignites the oxygen starved atmosphere
Conflagration spreads across the planet
Consuming the thermosphere
Let deadly radiation cook all remaining traces of life
The world destroyed by warfare unfathomable to all but me
Your fate has been written
It will always come to pass
Your history has proven
You cannot learn from your past
Your fate has been written
It will always come to pass
Your history has proven
You cannot learn from your past
This is the future I foresee
Visions of death besieging me
This is the future I foresee
Where are your leaders whilst you stand alone
Forced to kill your own kind for nothing more than
A broken throne
Where are your leaders whilst you stand alone
Forced to kill your own kind for nothing more than
A broken throne
Glorified parasites dictate your every action
Cowering behind closed doors, safe from their endless wars
No emotions
No reactions
Bodies of the dead cleared from the streets with bulldozers
Victims of your continued march evacuate their squalor
The fire fills the skyline, visions of hell for all to see
The virus bombs begin to fall again consuming everything
The way of man
Manufacture death through horrific means
Pandora's form of warfare
Causing terror and endless suffering
Playing God in reverse
Unmake what came before
The box that was once opened
