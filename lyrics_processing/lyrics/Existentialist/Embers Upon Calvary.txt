Palace of death below
Embrace chaos unknown
Dwell amongst shadows and bones
The martyr preaches of avoiding sin
But the hypocrite won't prevail
I was there in the beginning when
The wretch crawled from the virgin
Endless pious hypocrisy
Exhume my soul eternally
The Martyr's cross burns upon Calvary
As the sinless cry in futility
So futile
So fucking futile
Suffering born from faith so blind
You defy your mind and spite your eyes
The prophecy of redemption
Is nothing more than a control forged fabrication
So follow me down to the shadows below
In a kingdom of bones, seek knowledge unknown
Fire consumes the flesh and the soul
My form before exists no more
You might also likeWitness him come again
Thy Lord, our savior, bereft of sin
Scratching, clawing tearing his way
From betwixt the thighs of thy virgin
He shall smite all who stand in his way
A tyrant demanding praise to an absent father
Yet you
Kneel
Prostrate
Before
The son
Of God
He lies
Give in
To sin
And...
Follow me down into the depths of hell
Worship the death below
Embrace knowledge unknown
Walk now with shadows and bones
The ranks of heretics swell
Legions forged from hell
Your scriptures are your own undoing
Burn the crosses upon Calvary
A beacon to light the way for all to see
Bring the enlightened ones to me
Only once dead do most gleam the error of their beliefs
The lie of the savior coercing the meek
Truth in plain sight, Hell is this endless strife, not in the afterlife
In this palace of the dead, a world below
My legions martial forged from steel, shadows and bone
A horde destined to usurp the prophet sat on high
A thousand souls burning atop Calvary
You suffer through choice, faith has made you so blind
Defying all logic, the weak still flock to him
The prophecy of redemption
Is nothing more than a control forged fabrication
So follow me down to the shadows below
Join my kingdom of bones, we'll usurp the throne
My legions bereft of the flesh and the soul
Now we will topple the false idol "our Lord"
Follow me down to my kingdom below
A world of shadows and bone
Bathed in the fiery glow
We usurp the lies of the malevolent Lord
As I watch the scorched earth cooling
I see the masses of believers weeping
Their faith in an immortal deceiver dashed like infant skulls
On the mountainside
The corpse-martyr ablaze
