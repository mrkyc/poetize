And love down the straight highway
There's danger in the outskirts of town
And in what you don't say
You're either sinking or thinking
The dark's your romance
Or a special one's shining a light on a chance
That it's all very worthy to ache
In the middle of the night
Sometimes i can't sleep
I can't keep all these feelings at bay
I am rage, i am sorrow and grief
All alone in my way
I know humor and heartbreak
And people are life
If i keep my eyes closed
I'll be open to strife
Because the powers that be send their love
In the middle of the night
I'm gonna stand up
And let myself be counted for
Stand up now
I've got my one life
And what's it to amount to
If i don't learn how
To love you and love myself beside you
Mix the gentle and proud
I want to love life
The vision in the window told me --
Stand up
You might also likeTo my mother my father
My witnesses live in my jagged heart
That for years has been running like fire
As though that was its part
From lover to cover and ocean to sky
From desert to mountain and promise to lie
I can say that i've prayed to forgiveness
In the middle of the night
I'm gonna stand up
And let myself be counted for
Stand up now
I've got my one life
And what's it to amount to
If i don't learn how
To love you and love myself beside you
Mix the gentle and proud
I want to love life
The vision in the window told me --
Stand up
Now i can see love in the woman
And love in the man in myself
I see how most people just ache to be good
At expressing themselves
And i wish i could tell you just right what i mean
About the light shining down, if i'd only come clean
But for now i live with myself
In the middle of the night
I'm gonna stand up
And let myself be counted for
Stand up now
I've got my one life
And what's it to amount to
If i don't learn how
To love you and love myself beside you
Mix the gentle and proud
I want to love life
The vision in the window told me --
