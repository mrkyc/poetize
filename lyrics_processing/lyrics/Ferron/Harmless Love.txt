Take a new step in an old direction
If you think about tenderness
What's the matter with harmless love
I take a little walk outside
In a town that brings me
Pears and peaches
I'm busting with love inside
And it's always more than it ever teaches
On the curb i pass a friend of mine
We seem a little older maybe a little wiser
We laugh about the shades of time
And marvel at love, the great skyrider
What's the matter with harmless
(harmless)
Take a new step in an old direction
If you think about tenderness
(think about, think about a little tenderness)
What's the matter with a hand-on-a-hand affection
Do you dream about a new day
(harmless)
You gotta dream about something strong and simple
(dream)
"each and every" is a kind thing to say
What's the matter with harmless love
You might also likeYou play it cool and then you love someone
You try to fight it but kind love knows
You tell yourself you're in it just for fun
But ain't it funny how good love shows
You know how to tell a joke in troubled times
Pass the sugar on a cold dark night
Spend a nickel just to save that dime
Toward a winter that will bite just right
What's the matter with harmless
(harmless)
Take a new step in an old direction
If you think about tenderness
(think about, think about a little tenderness)
What's the matter with a hand-on-a-hand affection
Do you dream about a new day
(harmless)
You gotta dream about something strong and simple
(dream)
"each and every" is a kind thing to say
What's the matter with harmless love
Light a candle for softness
Light a candle for friends til they come thru
Light a candle for warm, kind love
Light a candle for me and you
'cause there's a reason we've come here
Are we holding back or are we willing for a connection
While knowing what we hold most dear
Must eventually surrender to it's own direction
What's the matter with harmless
(harmless)
Take a new step in an old direction
You think about tenderness
(think about, think about a little tenderness)
What's the matter with a hand-on-a-hand affection
Do you dream about a new day
