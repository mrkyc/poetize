And revamp
There is a way through constant sorrow
But we must do more than light the lamp
Unlike Zhivago at the window Pining Lara's love
We dare not wait the weather to join the
High suspended dove
Cause yesterday my baby girl walked up to a little boy
And I watched her curl her arms around him
And transform her fear to joy
And if I believe we've blown our purpose
Then I might have missed the chance
To see Gandhi in two babies bodies
And watch them spin and dance
You gotta go for fire
You gotta go for what you know so well
You gotta go for why you came this way
And Live your story tall and well
Maybe you can't believe somehow
That things can turn around
All your life it just seemed like some were destined upward
And some were destined down
You might also likeAnd it's just not gonna be that simple for us
Cause it's not so hard to see
That's it's a huge and limitless sky describing what will be
And there might be a disillusioning calm
In the winds that blow
But believe that changes come
Keep your dream, knowing dreams come slow
And beat your drum for those before you
And for those eager on the side
And light a candle for life's still and riotous dream to
Dwell where love abides
You gotta go for the mystery
You gotta go for the high true flight
To deny the grace in tragedy
Is to deny the beauty in the owl's lonesome night
You gotta go for fire
You gotta go for what you know so well
You gotta go for why you came this way
And live your story cell to cell to cell
If we're in everything we think, and everything we do
Then I am in you and you're in me
And only Nothing is as true
There is a way through constant sorrow
There is a way through constant sorrow
