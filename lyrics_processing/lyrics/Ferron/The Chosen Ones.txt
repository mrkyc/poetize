How they wear it like they had it from the start
I must have been the other kind...
The kind with just a lonely mind and heart
And from where you stand you're an attractive revelation
And from where I stand I'm mostly on my knees
And from there I said hello, felt something small and slow
Say "Please, please, please"
And though it's just a thought, It's such a saving shot...
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among the broken ones
I remember crying down a long and withered highway
I remember waiting for my story to begin
Had all my laughs cut short, a boat without a port
A ragged house of tin
But ... maybe it's true about the teacher when you're ready
Maybe it's true about the hollow and the slope
Love, turn my steps around
Let me fall on solid ground with Faith and rope
And though its just a thought, I say it's all I've got...
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among
The broken ones
Outside a window there's a night beyond all secrets
And outside that window there's a window shining in
And it shows a room that has a fire steady burning
And a woman knowing that the darkness can't come in
And she wants to thank you for your love and understanding
She needs to thank you for your honour to the soul
It's love from someone who believed she'd need a stand in
To tell her story let alone to live it whole
And though it's just a thought, she says it's all we've got
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among
The broken ones
Stand among the broken ones
Stand among the broken ones...
For every person
May love come through
For every person
