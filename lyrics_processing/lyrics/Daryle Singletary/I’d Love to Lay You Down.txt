There's a lot of ways of sayin' what I wanna say to you
There's songs and poems and promises and dreams that might come true
But I won't talk of starry skies or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you I'd just love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
And I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down

There's so many ways your sweet love's made this house into a home
You've got a way of doin' little things that turn me on
Like standin' in the kitchen, in your faded cotton gown
With your hair all up in curlers, I'd still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
And I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down

When a whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded and silver takes its place
Well, you'll be just as lovely, and I'll still be around
And if I can, I know that I'd still love to lay you down
You might also like
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
And I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
And I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down
