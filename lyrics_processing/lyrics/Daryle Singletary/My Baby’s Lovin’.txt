I got a woman that's in love with me
She give me lovin' like it's supposed to be
She's wide open, she don't hold back
She's gonna get me with a heart attack
If it kills me I don't mind
I'll be smilin' all the while I'm dyin'
My baby's lovin' is oh so fine
My baby's lovin' is oh so fine
I love the way she can't let me be
You know she starts kissin', talkin' sweet to me
She's walkin' around in them high heel shoes
She got me doin' anything that she wants me to
And if it kills me I don't mind
I'll be smilin' all the while I'm dyin'
My baby's lovin' is oh so fine
My baby's lovin' is oh so fine
My baby's lovin' is oh so fine
Every way she dresses drives me wild
My baby's got a unique style
She's got me eatin' from the palm of her hand
She makes me feel, she makes me feel like a full grown man
