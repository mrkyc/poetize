Said your behind on the note on the farm and it's too late
If you don't pay-up in the next couple weeks
We're going to foreclose and your out on the street
So he wadded up the paper real tight in his hand
Said your in for a fight if your after my land
So he got in his truck and drove to his neighbors
Sold him his cow and his old Bloomer trailer
He cut down the corn and he rolled-up the hay
He cleaned out the barn and built him a stash
Got on the horn with Willie and the CDB
Got a concert lined-up cause they want to come see
Them Rockin in the Country their dance in the fields
Where the corn used to grow and the cows used to graze
Their kickin up their heels comin by the truck loads
Packem in tight they'll be Rockin in the Country
From Friday til Saturday night
Some say that he's nothin but a dumb old farmer
But while he's takin up tickets at the gate he's a charm
He's got a mile wide grin like a sly old fox
And those pockets on his overalls are about to pop
They say the old coots got a million stashed
The folks at the banks been a kissin his grassss
Them Rockin in the Country their dance in the fields
Where the corn used to grow and the cows used to graze
Their kickin up their heels comin by the truck loads
Packem in tight they'll be Rockin in the Country
From Friday til Saturday night
Showem Charlie
Awesomeeeeeeeeee
Yeah their Rockin in the Country their dance in the fields
Where the corn used to grow and the cows used to graze
Their kickin up their heels comin by the truck loads
Packem in tight they'll be Rockin in the Country
From Friday til Saturday night
