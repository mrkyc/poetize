I couldn't care any less
I couldn't care for the damned
I couldn't care any less
I couldn't care, it's a play so

It's a play on me
It's a play on you
It's a play on me
It's a play on...

Abundant redundancy!
There is no place for you and me
Abundant redundancy
I won't leave quietly
So sick of this life, how it's unabated
Sick of this life and I wanna check out!

I couldn't care any less
They could not bear any uses
I cannot care any less
Offend their hearts and take the dare
You might also like
It's a play on me
It's the brewing plans
Fewer uses
We are truth-less

Abundant redundancy!
There is no place for you and me
Abundant redundancy
I won't leave quietly
So sick of this life, how it's unabated
Sick of this life and I wanna check out!
Abundant redundancy!
There is no place for you and me
Abundant redundancy
I won't leave quietly
Chalk it up to misleading
Chalk it up to my heart bleeding

I couldn't care any more
I couldn't care because I'm useless
I couldn't care any more
I couldn't care because I'm falling down
And they play off of me
And they play off of you
I'm getting used to this
We are...
Sick of this life, as before I stated
Sick of this life and I wanna check out!
I wanna check out
I wanna check out
I wanna check out

So sick of this life, how it's unabated
Sick of this life and I wanna check out
Abundant redundancy!
There is no place for you and me
Abundant redundancy!
I won't leave quietly
Abundant redundancy!
There is no place for you and me
Abundant redundancy I won't leave quietly
So sick of this life, how it's unabated
