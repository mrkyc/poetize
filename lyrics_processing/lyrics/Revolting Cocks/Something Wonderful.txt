I'm crawling in my head with the walking dead
I've got a cold sweat on my skin
I'm fighting back the demons in a waking dream
Where my weakness will become a sin
I'm holding onto terror, it's my guiding light
It's gonna pull me out of my mind
A never-ending telepathic testimony
To the fear that I feel inside

Hell is not a place, it's a game you play
And suffer every move you make
Possession is the prize in the enemy eyes
You pay for every chance you take
A soul is not a soul until it lives in a hole
With a hacked up life and limb
The pain that you find can make you feel so fine
The alienation's dead

At the back of your mind
Go to the other side
Hello, is anyone home?
But you've been left alone
You might also like
Maybe I'll submit to my own desire
Will the agony be too extreme?
Something deep inside pulled my legs wide open
And the whisper turned into a scream
Took me by surprise when I heard my cries
Because I didn't recognize my voice
A schizophrenic call or a voodoo doll
Too terrified to make that choice

I've been stabbed in the back
By a maniac
And I thought it was me
But I didn't have the guts to believe

Beyond good and evil lie the future ghosts
That surround us like a ring of flames
Summoned here by innocents and fools alike
For the pleasure of the game
I wish to hell I was a stronger man
And I could heal just as quick as scar
But I'm weak, when I'm in this deep
It's not a game anymore, it's gone too far
I've been stabbed in the back
By a maniac
And I thought it was me
