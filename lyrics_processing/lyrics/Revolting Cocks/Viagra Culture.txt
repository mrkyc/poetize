I must win
At everything I do, I must win
My car must win
My money must win
My house must win
My hair must win
My kids must win
My wiener must win
My wife must win
My mistress must win
My trip to the bunny ranch must win!
I must win in business
I must win when I mow the lawn
If I do not win, I am not in control
So I must win!
Again and again!
I don't need more
But I must have it
More, more
Or the game gets old, I must win, I must win!
Everyone else must lose, because I must win!
We have met the weapon of mass destruction...
And it is us!

You, girls gone wild
This is how life must be
To keep the sheep asleep
Viagra stars

Viagra bars
Viagra scars

Ah, nothing is ever enough
We get bored when we can't get stuff
We like our leaders to be stupid and violent
Regular guys like us
What's so bad about the fall of Rome
When we're the ones who got all the gold?
Never share anything with anyone else
Or you're a bunch of girly men!
