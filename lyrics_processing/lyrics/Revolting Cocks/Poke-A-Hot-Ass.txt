I get ass all the time
My fingers smell of victory
I get ass from so many people
I have a directory

If I was an Indian, if I was an Indian, if I was an Indian, I'd be Poke-A-Hot-Ass
If I was an Indian, if I was an Indian, if I was an Indian, I'd be Poke-A-Hot-Ass
I'd be Poke-A-Hot-Ass
I'd be Poke-A-Hot-Ass
I'd be Poke-A-Hot-Ass

I ain't no guilty man
I ain't no guilty man
I ain't no guilty man cause I am Poke-A-Hot-Ass!
I ain't no guilty man
I ain't no guilty man
I ain't no guilty man cause I am Poke-A-Hot-Ass!
Follow me to nearest 

I smell like ass more than ever
I get more ass than a Catholic priest
I move fast to set the table
And you are my asshole feast

So meet me at 

If I show you mine, and you show me yours, we both know that won't be enough
But if I show you mine, but you don't show me yours, I know that I will end up in handcuffs
And not the good kind!
And not the good kind!
If I show you mine, and you show me yours, I'll be a postman and deliver the mail
But if I show you mine and you don't show me yours, once again, I'll spend the night in jail
Not where I wanna be
