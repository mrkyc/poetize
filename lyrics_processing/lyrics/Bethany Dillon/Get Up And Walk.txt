Except if that someone's me
I washed my hands but just the same
My eyes confess for me
I come in filthy rags
You know I am guilty
I wake up almost every night
Saying Your name
What I would give to walk in the light
But what I hide has made me lame
My face down on the ground
I wait to hear the healing sound
You break through my deafness
Swing open the curtain
And I find the courage
To get up and walk
I forget my weakness
For You've answered my loneliness
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see my hope has come
You might also likeYou'll have to show me where to go
It's been so long since I've used my feet
I got up today a cripple
And now I'm dancing
So let the power of Your move
Not stop with what I can see
You break through my deafness
Swing open the curtain
And I find the courage
To get up and walk
I forget my weakness
For You've answered my loneliness
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see my hope has come
Ooh, ooh, yeah, I couldn't walk
Ooh, I couldn't sing
Ooh, oh, I couldn't love
Until You found me
In my deafness
Swing open the curtain
And I found the courage
To get up and walk
Oh, I forget my weakness
For You've answered my loneliness
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see
You break through my deafness
Swing open the curtain
And I find the courage
To get up and walk
Oh, I forget my weakness
For You've answered my loneliness
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see
Through the mud on my eyes
I can see
Through the mud on my eyes
