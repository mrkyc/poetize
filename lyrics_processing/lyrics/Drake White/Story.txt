Jimmy is a late-night lover
Teresa is the homecoming queen
Randall is a high school football star still living that small-town dream
Yep
And Jessie went and joined the navy
After her and Terry broke up
While charlie ran off to Vegas and ran into a big long line of bad luck

Everybody got their good days, bad days, ups and downs
We're all on the same world
Spinning around
Flying with the birds
Sinking with the stones
Living on prayer's
Keeping up with the joneses
Some got a little
Some got a lot
Some of us are lost
Some of us are not
But everybody got their moment in glory cause everybody got their story

Janice wants to write like Falkner
Steven wants to sing like bruce
Now dilly wants to smoke with willie and come to think of it I do too
Sally's gonna be a ma-ma ma-ma
At the ripe age of 17
And my granddaddy's married to his sweetheart
He just turned 83
