Yeah we never really know how it's all gonna go but the world keeps spinning even if it's slow some times
Well we leave and we stay, let the wind lead the way, we don't live forever, gotta make a little hay while the sun shines
We get lost some, we get found some, we get high and we get down some

We live some, we love some, fall down and get up some
We fly some, we sink some, get hurt so we drink some
We take some, we give some, forget and forgive some
Some days all you got is a rock in your shoe but you still gotta move or we die all we do is live some
Give your heart to a few, get it broke a time or two then you put it back together, yeah forever need some glue some times
Make a promise, settle down, rip the roots from the ground, plant them in another town where the river runs wild
We're young some, yeah we're old some
We go out into the world and go back home some
We live some, we learn some, build bridges then burn some
We buy some, we sell some, chase heaven, raise hell some
We break some, we fix some, can't help but talk shit some
Some days all you got is a rock in your shoe but you still got a move or we die all we do is live some
So get to living, don't cry about that spilled milk on the floor
So some laughing, do some fishing, find a little quiet in the noise
And live some, and love some, fall down and get up some
We fly some, we sink some, get hurt so we drink some
We take some, we give some
Forget and forgive some
