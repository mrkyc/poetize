Oh, I ain't no politician
I ain't no suit and tie
Lord, I wasn't cut out for that type of livin'
Some folks choose that
And I reckon that's all right
But I'm a fan of the simple life
I said I'm a fan of beer ice cold
Wavin at my neighbor when I meet him on the road
Kissin on my woman in the moonlight
Yeah, I'm a fan of the simple life
Give me a new pair of boots
A small piece of land
A little ol' house where I can hang my hat
I'll be a happy man, yes I'm a fan of the simple life
Yes I'll take a country road
Yes I'll take a row of beans
I'll take an old church pew, with my family sittin next to me
I said a sunrise, sunset grillin' on the back steps
Pickin on a good song tonight
Hey, I'm a fan of the simple life
I said I'm a fan of beer ice cold
Wavin at my neighbor when I meet him on the road
Kissin on my woman in the moonlight
Yeah, I'm a fan of the simple life
Give me a new pair of boots
A small piece of land
A little ol' house where I can hang my hat
I'll be a happy man, yes I'm a fan of the simple life
Yeah, I'm a fan of beer ice cold
Wavin at my neighbor when I meet him on the road
Kissin on my woman in the moonlight
Yeah, I'm a fan of the simple life
Give me a good pair of boots
A small piece of land
A little ol' house where I can hang my hat
I'll be a happy man, yes I'm a fan of the simple life
Ohhh
A fan of the simple life
