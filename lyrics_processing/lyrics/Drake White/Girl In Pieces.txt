I ain't ever seen a heart so broken
I ain't ever seen a face so sad
If he was dumb enough to screw you over
He must not have known what he had
The green in your eyes is all over the floor
But it's Friday night and I'm at your door
'Cause I don't wanna see you cryin'
No you ain't gonna cry no more

I see a girl in pieces, baby let me pick you up
Get you back on your feet and
Give you love, a love, a love
Well I hate that he hurt you, but I got a healin' touch
I see a girl in pieces, let me pick you up
And show you love, a love, a love
Yeah, woah, come on

That chandelier smile you're hidin'
Is 'bout to get the switch flipped on
When your little light ain't shinin'
The whole world is singin' a sad song
Go get your high heels, put 'em on your feet
I ain't taking no, you're comin' out with me
'Cause I don't wanna see you cryin'
Baby don't cry no more

And it's love, love, love
