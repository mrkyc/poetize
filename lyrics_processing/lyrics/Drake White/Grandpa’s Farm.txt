It's gonna be a long hot summer
The heat's gonna come for sure
And makin' you love me may take long
But down here everything is slow
Sheets are blowing on the clothesline
Honeysuckle make 'em smell so sweet
The way you feel when you lay down on 'em
You can't get from no machine

I know you come down every season
You waste time on your grandpa's farm
I ain't tryin' to talk you out of leavin'
A little sun won't do you no harm
Mmm no
C'mon

Now go ahead and put your swimsuit on
The sky's bright and the water's fine
And if you don't feel like swimmin'
We'll find a bank and we'll wet a line
'Cause I know up in the city
There ain't no space to run 'round there
Down here we got dirt streets
Your bare feet can't help but settle down in
You might also like
I know you come down every season
You waste time on your grandpa's farm
I ain't tryin' to talk you out of leavin'
A little sun won't do you no harm
No, it won't do you no harm, baby

Come out the screen door
Little high rise queen
Get dirty and dig up your roots
You got time to kill where the world is greener
Let me help you find something to do
Let's have a moon dance where the wild things play
I know a clearing where the stars are bright
You can go back to the city when the summer is over
Baby, let's make the most of the night yeah

I know you come down every season
You waste time on your grandpa's farm
I ain't tryin' to talk you out of leavin'
A little sun won't do you no harm
I know you come down every season
You waste time on your grandpa's farm
I ain't tryin' to talk you out of leavin'
A little sun won't do you no harm
Yeah, won't do ya, won't do ya no harm
Dig it, oh
Where the wild things play, yeah
Woah, hey there
Well, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, come on
Well, come on
Well, come on
Well, come on
Well, come on
Come on, on, on, yeah baby
