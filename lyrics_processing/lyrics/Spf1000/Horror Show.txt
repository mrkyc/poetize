The bat in gas light
The bride in the tomb
The storm at midnight
The witch, the moon
The casket, the grave
The sweet smell of death
The paintings in the hall
We love it all
We love it all

Hiding in the sheets, afraid to go to sleep, giving you the creeps
We're in the horror show
Walls stained red, it's undead, underneath your bed
We're in the horror show
Hiding in the sheets, afraid to go to sleep, giving you the creeps
We're in the horror show
Walls stained red, it's undead, underneath your bed
We're in the horror show

It's killed another kid
Snuck in through the window
Close your eyes, go to bed
Maybe it won't find your bedroom
It creeps, it crawls, it scratches
Fighting it's way from the grave
Through the cemetery tombs and headstones
It's time to be saved
You might also like
Hiding in the sheets, afraid to go to sleep, giving you the creeps
We're in the horror show
Walls stained red, it's undead, underneath your bed
We're in the horror show
Hiding in the sheets, afraid to go to sleep, giving you the creeps
We're in the horror show
Walls stained red, it's undead, underneath your bed
We're in the horror show

Maybe you can turn off the TV
Maybe you can turn your head
But this time you might
Be the one that ends up dead
Take me in to the darkness
Take me out of the light
Take me in to the darkness
Take me out of the light

Hiding in the sheets, afraid to go to sleep, giving you the creeps
We're in the horror show
Walls stained red, it's undead, underneath your bed
We're in the horror show
Hiding in the sheets, afraid to go to sleep, giving you the creeps
We're in the horror show
Walls stained red, it's undead, underneath your bed
