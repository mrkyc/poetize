Try not to think of the feelings you've got
It's better if you don't think about him
That way you can live without sin
I'm everything you've ever wanted
I'm everything that you will never need
We're both in this together
And we're both gonna bleed
Go on home and end your little life
Come to mine
Go on home and end your little life
Come to mine
You think you're so lucky
And maybe you are
You've gotten away with this for so long (so long)
A peice of art
I love your pale skin
And your deceptive mind
Everything I hate about myself I see in you
We're two of a kind
Go on home and end your little life
Come to mine
Go on home and end your little life
Come to mine
