Kill, kill, kill, kill
Dead, dead, dead
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Dead, dead, dead
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Dead, dead, dead
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Mosquitoes are thick out there in the darkness
And it's too hot for me to sleep
I see faces in the shadows, in the walkway
I hear voices in the sadness of the trees
There's something strange about you
The way your feet don't touch the floor
The way you sit up there on the window
The way you quoth: "Nevermore"
I've watched you dance in the garden
I want to be just like you:
Dead, baby, dead
(Dead, dead, dead!)
Kill, baby, kill
(Kill, kill, kill, kill!)
Dead, baby, dead
(Dead, dead, dead!)
Kill, baby, kill
(Kill, kill, kill, kill!)
You might also likeI'm in love with the living dead
And we're trapped inside this house together
You play the countess, I'll play the slave
And we can play forever
And we can play forever
And we can play forever
How many died beside you
And now are trapped within these walls?
I know to be with you means forever
I still want to be like them all
I won't walk with the living
To be with you and be dead
I won't walk with the living
To be with you
And to be-
To be-
To be-
To be-
Dead, dead, dead
Kill, kill, kill, kill
Dead, baby, dead
(Dead, dead, dead!)
Kill, baby, kill
(Kill, kill, kill, kill!)
Dead, baby, dead
(Dead, dead, dead!)
Kill, baby, kill
(Kill, kill, kill, kill!)
I'm in love with the living dead
And we're trapped inside this house together
You play the countess, I'll play the slave
I'm in love with the living dead
And we're trapped inside this house together
You play the countess, I'll play the slave
And we can play forever
And we can play forever
