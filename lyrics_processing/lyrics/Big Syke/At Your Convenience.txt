*phone rings*
What's up baby?, what you doing?
I'm just in the kitchen cooking you dinner
Hey?, you know what? I ain't even gon' be able to make it
I got to take care ah some business
What, what the fuck is your problem?
I got to take care ah some business
I'm tired of this shit, I can't believe this shit...

I was so in love with you
Did everything you want me too
Try my best to turn away
The temptation got ya here today
I really wanna let you go
But my mind and body's telling me no
It's at your convenience
So I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
So I don't know what to do

Baby I'm bout my money and my family and a woman that stands by me
So don't get upset when you can't find me
Don't tie me down
I'll come around when my business is through
I know you had plans and things for us to do but maybe you
Think I'd rather be some other place maxin'
I'd rather be at your place relaxin'
Can't be no everyday quality time playa
I got bills and things to do so I'll see ya later
With you it's cool I'd be a fool not to get paid
Lay up under you and not pursue what needs to be made
Parlayin' ain't possible responsible for carryin' the weight
Who you lookin' at when the bills late, oh wait
What about the trip you wanna take to the Bahamas?
Ain't gon' be no trip wid all this drama
Ask your momma, about a man always around not wantin' nothing
Got to separate to get something
It's at whose convenience?
You might also like
It's at your convenience
I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
And I don't know what to do
It's at your convenience
I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
And I don't know what to do

My girlfriends say I'm crazy
For wantin' to have your baby
I tell 'em money's not the issue
It's all the time that I miss you
I wanna know why ya friends come before me
All the free time you get you ignore me
Breaking dates, you're always late
You're making my love turn into hate
Why does it have to be this way
What happened to forever and a day
I want it all now

So much trouble in the world baby
Can't nobody feel my pain
The strain and pressure in life you had to sacrifice sometime
To stay on point on a thin line
Find the closest denominator to stay together
Whatever choice may be, I'm ready for whatever
Cause I slept alone and been alone many a nights
With no woman, why we argue over petty fights?
Alright I'm feelin' what ya sayin' okay
Remember we did it in the Caddy on the highway
My way, I been used to for a long time
Souls are hard to combine, it takes time
Me and my homies have a bond and a plan
I'm your man, it's just some things you don't understand
Can we work it out and try to find a way?
Or never let it out and go our separate ways?
I don't know, huh-huh, but I can handle it baby....
It's at your convenience
I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
And I don't know what to do
It's at your convenience
I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
