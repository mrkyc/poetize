It's the road dog to Tupac, back on the block
And the only reason they got it locked, 'cause we stopped
Now some say they changed the game
But it's the same in L.A. where we ball and bang
Ain't no thang, I had a ball when Pac was on the row
You should know a lot of cowards glad to see ya go
But I don't know 'em from the West and I'm born and raised
On purple haze where we bangin' cradle to the grave
A hood slave in the middle of the killing fields, it's all real
Now everybody wanna know, how I feel
About everybody over thuggin' and mean muggin'
But that was Makaveli playin' thought it wasn't?
So don't you try to look at me as a 
I'm a thug life O.G. and straight rider
When you head west, leave your vest and you're stressed
You got nice ice doin' your best, yes

I was born to ball on your hooks 'cause I'm a crook
Here's a real deal so take a look, and get shook
Like a earthquake when I shake, I stay baked
What you really hate is not your fate, you cupcake
You wanna see me livin' on the edge or in the feds
Or you probably wanna see me dead, I'm dumpin' lead
On you cowards and you dream killers 'til you feel us
And you'll never find out who the real is 'til you kill us
Like my women fine with a mind of her own
That don't call me all the time on the phone
I love to play everyday but no way
'Cause the day I go broke is the day she go away
And brothers gettin' rollin' eyes with snow bunnies
Sister would you realize it ain't the money
Just let him be and you will see, he free
Be satisfied that you got a thug like me goin'

I love ladies from L.A out the hood
I would let everybody play if I could
I remember back in high school, I was a fool
The hood taught me how to bang and act a fool
But I was swingin' through Crenshaw and Fairfax
Westchester Hamilton, where you at?
Morningside  you see me
In the parkin' line humpin' bump ya hotty
Hawthorne and Washington, on your campus
Losing at Jefferson who's the baddest?
Jordan to  on imperial
Bangin' my stereo, you don't feel me though
Saint Mary's to the Michaels' add the tight ho's
You know how life goes, made me psycho
And I'm still tryna find the way out of me
I'm at U-C-L-A and U-S-C goin'

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey now
Big Femi up in the house
Thug Life Outlawz, still breathin'
West Coast style, born and raised
From the cradle to the grave
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey, hey, hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey
