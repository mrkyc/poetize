Big Syke daddy, take me away
Somewhere that we can parlay
Big Syke daddy, take me away
Somewhere that we can parlay
Hey hey baby you know I will

You can be my girl, I'll take you 'round the world
You'll like it, just call me Syke
Might get a little heated, warm what's needed
Problems let me treat it
Tell them suckas they can beat it
I'm all you will need
I'll feed, ya starvin' passion
At the right speed maxin' without crashin'
Ain't no love like the love I'll show ya
(Yeah I like it), See I told ya?
Believe good things come to those who wait
But now that you got it don't hesitate, my soulmate
I'm searchin' for her through the universe
You will cum first a lot ah pleasure but it's worth it
Every minute, the prize you winnin'
Windows tinted, the corners we bendin', HEY!

Just try it, and you will like it
Treat me right, and I'll keep it tight
Day and night, I think of you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
You might also like
Big Syke daddy, take me away
Somewhere that we can parlay

Baby you don't ever have to ask what I've got or what I'm givin'
It's first class even though I'm thug livin'
Big Syke devoted to the life
Whether Benz or bike doing things you like
Call me satellite baller your girlfriend watcher
In her eyes I see en-vy...
She can wink her eye but ya can best believe
She won't be with me...
I'll be sick, you the flyest and Bonnie of your clique
So when it came to choosin' you the one I had to pick
So stick with me or be history like the rest
Gimme the test so we can chill and release stress
You can tell me your deepest secrets and wildest dreams
And I'll tell you war stories and crazy things
Although it seems I'm too rough
I got enough sense to put it down in the bed I commence
To rinse your troubles in bath bubbles is all we need
Satisfaction guaranteed, you will like

*woman moaning til the end of the song*
Big Syke daddy, take me away (I ain't playin' with you baby, you gon' like this)
Somewhere that we can parlay
Big Syke daddy, take me away (In the Jacuzzi on the road up and down the hall)
Somewhere that we can parlay (Anywhere you want it baby, that's how you gon' get it, I ain't lyin')
Just try it, and you will like it
Treat me right, and I'll keep it tight
Day and night, I think of you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you

Big Syke daddy, take me away
Somewhere that we can parlay
Big Syke daddy, take me away
