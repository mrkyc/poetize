Yeah though, it's the M-A-C y'all
Young M-A-C Mall yaknow what I'm sayin'?
From the Five-Tre-Five crew
Str8 Crestsider, (fa sure)
But I'm in the house wid my niggaaa
Big Syke from Thug Life bitch
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
And it's going down like this...

Wasted talent, wasted time, wasted minds
Suckas givin' up without trying
Satisfied with ya grind
Farakhan lacin' soldiers everyday but you blind
Ya best to beware, of this shit called minimum maximum
Cause all the hustlas is catching 'em
From Crestside to L.A
Cutty niggas can't dodge no case
Should dodge the bullet, when it's yo' fade
And I really don't know who bit the mell on the glow
But I fits to get it all before the two triple 0
Like Feddie and Big Row
Hennessy so let's toast for my peo-ples
And all the playas and pard-ners that ain't here
For my factors and my folks wid a million years
Wid no chance to appeal
I know ya thinkin' that it's to real
But playboy this the shit when ya lust for scrill
But if ya get it... huh ya won't look back
Be a certified star with ya own dope track
No tapes and CDs, just zips and Os
And a faulty fan club known as the po-pos
You won't last long
So for ya, grand finale
They ship ya ass off to the, fedaralies
Ya know....

You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stress

A one track mind on the street still sellin' yay
Advance and dance to romance the game everyday
Some niggas do sixteen trife bringin' wifes back
My homie caught four kis, body bags, fat sacks
How many 'vances can you get from the fools that you work with?
How many chances you gon' get, from niggas in yo click?
By any means for the greens is necessary
A stack off obituaries, and listen to cemeteries
With a name in the street fame, mo' game
Without the dope game, cocaine, insane
How many lives can I live in this shit
Money spent for ya blueprint laid by the government
Ghetto superstars yard rims made hard
Pullin' ho cards from the block to the boulevard
Checkin' my traps gettin' right wid my paper work
Been in the corner on Daytonas do a little dirt
I lost locs through the City of Angels
At the burial no star spangled
I got a new angle....
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stress
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stress

Every corner I turn, brothers holdin' on
What you waitin' on?, don't postpone, you gotta roll along
Sometimes if ya crew ain't true
Who's catchin' up on things already passed due
Look at Jack big ten quarterback
Now he's on crack he said he can't turn back
How you gonna act when the future slaps you in yo face?
Wish you was in another place, steady pace
Is how I'm going you ain't knowin' how it really is
Givin' drugs to the thugs and the little kids
Smokin' sticks spendin' time barely gettin' by
Didn't even try, to busy gettin' high
World don't owe you, me or nobody else
It's cold for sure, so do for self
Let somebody else wonder and disbelieve
What you could achieve
Don't waste your talent, like Joe
A basketball pro
He'll only be a pro in the ghetto
Cause he prolong, still wrong procrastinated
So many waited, they wasted they talent
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stress
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
