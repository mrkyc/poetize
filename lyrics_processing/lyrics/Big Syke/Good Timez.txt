Yeah...... yeah
The good times
When you was a little kid
Playing in the yard, you know

It seems like yesterday I used to play around the way
Those were the good times
Growing up as a child, carefree
Momma said I was wild by three
Even pops showed me love he was there
I remember hanging out playing truth or dare
Cowboys and indians, ring your bell and run
When the only thing we sprayed was water guns
We didn't have much so we made the best of
What we could afford but we had love
Tryna be grown might snick and curse
One TV set gotta cut it on first
Back in the good times and the Jefferson's
When ya next door neighbor was ya best friend
Those are the days I miss and reminisce...
So I steady wish, for the good times

Nothing but the good times on my mind, can I rewind
(I'm thinkin' bout the good times)
The time back to my early days, as children play (On my mind)
On the road to tomorrow (The good times, the good times)
Some passed away
So my future feels hollow (The good times)

I'm thinking back on my history, in my elementary
I wonder do they still remember me?
That little bad ass kid
The boy that wanted someone to help him, but they never did
So off to the office I go, you know
A problem case from the get go
Will I ever change before it's too late?
I need to study harder and get my life straight
Moms and pops praying for the best for me
I was blind and I couldn't see
But they told me friends come and go as you grow
Focus in, play to win, or you will live low
So I tried to do my best, failed every test
My life was becoming a mess
Even though the past years are far behind
They in my mind... considered as a good time

Nothing but the good times on my mind (Good times)
Can I rewind the time (The good times)
Back to my early days (They on my mind)
As children play (On my mind)
On the road to tomorrow (The good times)
Some passed away (Nothin' but the good times)
So my future feels hollow (Yeah)
I remember playing in the street with my little bro
Kickin' it with Mental and Big Kato where you go?
Dizzy D, Big Chip, rest in peace
Nece T and all my other people deceased
Can't let memories slip away
No I ain't okay, cause I haven't seen you today
Nothing but good times, on my mind, can I rewind?
The time back when I used to have a seventy-nine 'Lac
With a black phantom and I bought 'em selling crack
I want 'em back, my teachers Miss Satedon, Miss Nor-ville
Encouraged me, and wished me well
To excel in life, it's a high price
Good advice, summer nights fist fights
Saying, things wouldn't be so bad
If we got the things that we never had

I ain't mad, huh-ha-ha
I'm thinking 'bout the good times
I'm thinking 'bout the good times

Nothing but the good times on my mind
(Hey, that's all on my mind)
Can I rewind The time (The good times)
Back to my early days, as children play
(I'm thinkin' bout the good times)
On the road to tomorrow (You know)
Some passed away (Like when you was a kid)
So my future feels hollow (Runnin' around in the yard)
Nothing but the good times on my mind (Ya momma pickin' you up... School)
Can I rewind The time (Teacher callin' the house)
Back to my early days (You know)
As children play (Chillin' with your next door neighbor)
On the road to tomorrow (Goin' up to the park shootin' balls)
Some passed away (before they was doin' all that bustin and actin nuts)
So my future feels hollow (It was cool though)
Nothing but the good times on my mind (Good times)
Can I rewind the time (Good times)
Back to my early days, as children play
On the road to tomorrow
