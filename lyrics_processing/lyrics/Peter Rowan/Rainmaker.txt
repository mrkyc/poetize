You got to put on a real good show, tell the people anything
You got to get the Lord's attention any old way you can
Maybe He'll show a little mercy and start cryin' for the lined
Rainmaker, rainmaker the land is parched and dry
(It's a rainmaker)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the rain fall from the sky
(I'm a-talkin' 'bout)
Rainmaker, rainmaker the crops are gonna die
(Now listen to me now)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the Heaven's cry
Well, some say I work miracles, some say I'm just insane
Many a time I bet my life that I could make it rain
One time I had a whole town beatin' the drums
And singin' through the night
We watched the morning sun come up and not a raincloud in sight
I knew if I didn't make some weather and see them storm clouds gather
I'd be run out of town when the sun went down
Covered up in tar and feathers
I was on my knees and I raised my hands to the Heaven's high
I felt this rain like a sigh of relief come pourin' from the sky
Hey, hey, rainmaker, rainmaker the land is parched and dry
(I'm a-talkin' 'bout)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the rain fall from the sky
(Ah, yes)
Rainmaker, rainmaker the crops are gonna die
(I'm a-talkin' 'bout)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the Heavens' cry

Let the cool rain follow on down
Sometimes I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse
Too little rain is not enough and too much just makes things worse
Well, the good Lord promised me a miracle in this life
With only one condition
He said, "Take your money get out of town
Don't try and start another religion", oh, oh
Rainmaker, rainmaker the land is parched and dry
(Now listen to me now)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the rain fall from the sky
(I'm a-talkin' 'bout)

(Yeah)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the Heavens cry
Rainmaker
