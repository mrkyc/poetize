The legend you are about to hear is true. Only the needle should be changed to protect the record.

This is the countryside. My name is St George. I'm a knight.
Saturday, July 10th, 8:05 pm, I was working out of the castle on the nightwatch when a call came in from the Chief. A dragon had been devouring maidens; homicide. My job, slay him.

You call me, Chief?

Yes, the dragon again, devouring maidens. The King's daughter may be next.

Mmm-hmm. You got a lead?

Oh, nothing much to go on. Say, did you take that .45 automatic into the lab to have them check on it?

Yeah, you were right.

I was right?
Yeah, it was a gun.
8:22 pm, I talked to one of the maidens who had almost been devoured.

Could I talk to you, Ma'am?

Who are you?

I'm St. George, Ma'am. Homicide, Ma'am. Want to ask you a few questions, Ma'am. I understand you were almost devoured by the Ma'am, is that right, dragon?

It was terrible. He breathed fire on me. He burned me already!

How can I be sure of that, Ma'am?

Believe me, I got it straight from the dragon's mouth.

11:45 pm, I rode over the King's Highway. I saw a man, stopped to talk to him.
Pardon me, Sir. Could I talk to you for just a minute, Sir?

Sure, I don't mind.

What do you do for a living?

I'm a knave.

Didn't I pick you up on a 903 last year for stealing tarts?

Yeah, so what, you wanna make a federal case out of it?

No Sir, we heard there was a dragon operating in this neighborhood. We just want to know if you've seen him.

Sure, I've seen him.

Mmm-hmm, could you describe him for me?
What's to describe? You see one dragon, you seen 'em all!

Would you try to remember, Sir, just for the record? We just want to get the facts, Sir.

Well, he was, you know, he had orange polka dots...

Yes, Sir.

Purple feet, breathing fire and smoke...

Mmm-hmm.

And one big bloodshot eye right in the middle of his forehead and uh, like that.

Notice anything unusual about him?

No, he's just your run-of-the-mill dragon, you know.

Mmm-hmm. Yes Sir, you can go now.

Hey, by the way, how you gonna catch him?

I thought you'd never ask. A Dragonet.
3:05 pm, I was riding back into the courtyard to make my report to the lab. Then it happened.
It was the dragon.

Hey, I'm the fire-breathin' Dragon! You must be St George, right?

Yes, Sir.

I can see you got one of them new .45 caliber swords.

That's about the size of it.

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, you slay me!

That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

What do you mean?

I'm taking you in on a 502. You figure it out.

What's the charge?

Devouring maidens out of season.

Out of season? You'll never pin that rap on me! Do you hear me, cop?

Yeah, I hear you. I got you on a 412 too.

A 412? What's a 412?!

Over-acting. Let's go.

On September the 5th, the Dragon was tried and convicted. His fire was put out and his maiden-devouring license revoked.
