I might like to get to know you
But I can't hear you right now
You're competing with the music
But the music's way too loud
Why don't you write down your number and slip it to me
But you gotta maneuver discreetly
I don't want my business leaking
People like run they mouth and

I don't need no pressure from you
(Don't need no pressure, no pressure, no) Uh
Don't need no lectures from you
Just give me a night

I'ma sleep on it, sleep on it (Sleep on it)
And I'll get back at you when I wanna (When I wanna)
Sleep on it, sleep on it, sleep on it, sleep on it
You can keep popping off if you wanna (Yeah)
You keep on stressing me, you, you keep on stressing me (You keep on stressing me, you, you keep on)
Damn, keep on stressin' if you wanna (Damn)
Sleep on it, sleep on it, I'ma sleep on it, sleep on it
And I'll get back at you when I wanna, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You might also like
I would've loved to hit the dance floor
But it's way too crowded right now
Maybe, we'll bump into each other in the future
If you wanna see me, then you figure it out
Me and my girlfriends came to do it (Do it)
After workin' hard all week (All week)
We like to throw our open toes on and get jazzy
Lounge in the party, but you're tryna make me speak

(So, I don't) I don't need no pressure from you
(Don't need no pressure, no pressure, no) No
I don't need no lectures from you
Just give me one night

I'ma sleep on it, sleep on it (Sleep on it, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'll get back at you when I wanna (When I wanna, babe)
Sleep on it, sleep on it, sleep on it, sleep on it (Ooh)
You can keep popping off if you wanna (Keep on popping if you want)
You keep on stressing me, you, you keep on stressing me (Stressing me)
Damn, keep on stressin' if you wanna (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sleep on it, sleep on it, I'ma sleep on it, sleep on it
And I'll get back at you when I wanna, yeah, yeah (Aye, aye, I'll sleep on it)
Ooh, I ain't tryna be rude
But you're the third guy tonight that's come to me like this
You see I'm tryna be cool
But these dudes keep grabbing me, they keep on grabbing me
I ain't tryna be conceited
See, I appreciate the compliments you're giving to me
And any other night, it'll be alright
But now, there's way too much going on

I'ma sleep on it, sleep on it (Sleep on it until tomorrow)
And I'll get back at you when I wanna (Right, I'll get at you when I wanna, baby)
Sleep on it, sleep on it, sleep on it, sleep on it (Aye-aye)
You can keep popping off if you wanna (Keep on popping if you wanna, baby)
You keep on stressing me, you, you keep on stressing me (Keep on stressing me)
Damn, keep on stressin' if you wanna (But I don't wanna talk right now)
Sleep on it, sleep on it, I'ma sleep on it, sleep on it
