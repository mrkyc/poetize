It started with a Monte Carlo
Then, went and got a beamer
Her mom call me a D-boy
She said yes, he is a dreamer
Two tickets to the Matinee
Me and shorty way back in the day
Now, she's into films
Our thing just starts to dim
You know when you dealing with a bad boy, baby
I gotta keep it triller
Even if it hurt, you know

I won't sing to you like Chris and Ne-Yo
But I'm fresher than a stick of deo'
Take you to a place where the chef is Creole
Black beach right next to Rio (Ah)
Running out the house just to flip
Dice in my pocket, I'm with the CeeLo
Pull up to the crib and I hit Dawn
Beep-beep, Rick Dinero (Boss)
And I quip the Lada (Word)
That's right, let me flip the car though (Ah)
In the wind, might hit Chicago (Ah)
She might pick the cargo, yeah
Let's skip Apollo, Calorado's my Picasso (Boss)
We ride or die (Die)
She my little vato (Boss)

Can't hold it back, you know I'm so addicted to you
Cravings attack whenever I get closer to you
I'm in withdrawal whenever you're
Away, I just want you here with me, boy

Hop in my Coupe, I only got a room for two
Let's just explore, my only destination is

A place, where we can go

I'm getting hot and there ain't no denying (Ooh)
I know a spot where we can just go get
Lost together, right now, I'll do whatever

Hearts beating fast, but we're still moving (Slow)
My fantasy and, boy, just take
Control, come on, won't you let me know if I

You make me feel brand new, the things you

For your love, just like a drug
