We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back (Y'all wanna be stars)
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah (I'll make you a star, heh, check this out)

I keep the hood of that Coupe warm, wrinkle free suits on
A handshake from me is a redeemable coupon
Knowing me will get you all them little perks
So, you need to double back, throw that auto in reverse ('Cause)
It's pure beauty, can finally put a face to it (I see it)
So, never stop, shawty girl, leak brake fluid (Don't stop)
The night pedicures walkin' on better floors (Me, uh-huh)
Beat it in your S Don, Jimmy Choo, better stores (Yeah, that's right)
I been around the globe, my English is rusty
Trust me, you can hear that ocean when you touch me (Trust me)
I know you due for sale, you ain't gettin' stepped on (When you hear)
Or overlooked, pardon me, forgive me, my name's Sean (Uh-huh, uh-huh, let's go)

Show stoppin' at the latest spot
The ride shinin' with the open top
Hydraulics make our heads go nod
Hair blowin' in the breeze, yo, we superstars
Put in the keys, make that engine purr
Three in the back, one in the passenger
Slow creepin' 'cause we look that fly
All the boys tryna taste our candy ride

We sittin' on twenty-two's plus two
Mink bucket seats, neon blue
Color coordinate with them shoes
Yeah, we divas but we ride like big boys do
Black tinted with a white stripe interstate
Lookin' in the mirror at my Bad Boy fitted, yup
Show stoppin' till they lose they breath
Turn the wheel to the right, turn the wheel to the left

This is for my ladies in the 280's Mercedes
In the H3 Baby Ranges, Bentley Coupes, my Escalades
Say oh (Oh), oh (Oh, oh)
Break 'em off somethin' proper like a real showstopper
This is for my chicas with the Beamers A6's
'67 Chevys, Maserati, or a Lexus
Say oh (Oh), oh (Oh, oh)
Break 'em off somethin' proper like a real showstopper (Yeah, aye, aye, aye)
Hey shawty, please believe we ain't never seen chicks like this before
Thousand-dollar jeans with them candy 6-4's
Louis V sneaks matchin' Louis V seats
See ya swagger like no other, so them other's can't compete
Independent and discrete, check her VDS piece
Melt in ya mouth like M&M's, capish
She do whatever she wanna do, money out the yin-yang
Blowin' a dollar and the change in the Rover, switchin' lanes
I'ma take her under my wings, I'ma teach her things
She say she got paper cuts from countin' all this change
Tell her meet the parents like Ben Stiller
Baby, say she want them karats and them chinchillas

We in the car, we ride slow
