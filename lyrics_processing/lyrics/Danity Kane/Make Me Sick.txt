Oh
Oh
Yeah (Ooh, ooh, oh, oh)
You got me feeling crazy
It's like... just listen

What I got, couldn't feel any worse
It's like I'm possessed, under some kind of curse
Temperature on rise, I can't close my eyes
(I can't sleep at night and you're the reason why)

Got my heart out in the cold (Breaker, breaker)
I'm afraid of getting broke (Operator, 'rator)

S-O-S, I'm overboard (Cause you threw me in the sea)
Please get the medic, somebody rescue me (Got that fever from you)

Boy, can't breathe, bones are shaking (Ah)
Heavy spinning cause you make me (What?)
Boy, you make, see you make me
Ooh, you make me
You make me sick
Got the shivers when I'm near you
Call the doctor cause you make me, oh
Boy, you make, see you make me
Ooh, you make me
You make me sick

Got my heart out in the cold (Breaker, breaker)
Ooh, I'm afraid of getting broke, yeah (Operator, 'rator)
