I wanna know (Do you like that)
If you like that (I know you like that)

Starin' at me all night
While I'm out on the floor
It was clear what you wanted
So, you pushed up on it
I was grinding with the DJ
With my hands on the floor
I guess you couldn't take it
You got tired of waiting

(So, you walked over to me)
(Breathin' in my ear, talkin' 'bout what could be)
Saying you can do this and that
Then, you start workin' me like a champ and I'm like
You might also like
Oh, you're touchin' my body
Oh, you must want me to get started
Boy, I can't take it
It's so crazy how you makin' me feel (How you makin' me feel)
Oh, you're touchin' my body (Oh no)
Oh, you must want me to get started (Get it started)
Boy, I can't take it
It's so crazy how you makin' me feel

If I put you on, would you like that
Keep it nice and warm, do you like that
Do you on the floor, do you like that
I wanna give you some more, I know you like that

Now, you got me sweatin'
Dancin' out of my clothes
I was headed for the door
But you made it so I had to know
(Just what you was workin' with) Workin' with
(Put it out there, said to come get it) Out there
(Now, I'm the one that can handle it)
The way you workin' me out on the floor
(So, you walked over to me)
(Breathin' in my ear, talkin' 'bout what could be)
Saying you can do this and that
Then, you start workin' me like a champ and I'm like

Oh, you're touchin' my body (Oh)
Oh, you must want me to get started (You're touchin' me, baby)
Boy, I can't take it (Oh, crazy)
It's so crazy how you makin' me feel (You makin' me feel)
Oh, you're touchin' my body (Ooh, you're touchin' me again)
Oh, you must want me to get started (And again)
Boy, I can't take it (And I can't take it no more)
It's so crazy how you makin' me feel

If I put you on, would you like that
Keep it nice and warm, do you like that
Do it on the floor, do you like that
I wanna give you some more, I know you like that

When you're touchin' me like that (Touch me like that)
Step back and catch my breath (Catch my breath)
This way I've never felt (This way)
You do, that feels so well, well (Oh)
Oh, you're touchin' my body (My body)
Oh, you must want me to get started (Yeah, yeah)
Boy, I can't take it

Boy, I can't take it (Oh)
It's so crazy how you makin' me feel

If I put you on, would you like that
Keep it nice and warm, do you like that
Do it on the floor, do you like that
I wanna give you some more, I know you like that

Oh, you're touchin' my body
Oh, you must want me to get started
Boy, I can't take it
It's so crazy how you makin' me feel
Oh, you're touchin' my body
Oh, you must want me to get started
Boy, I can't take it
It's so crazy how you makin' me feel

(Ah, would you like that)
Would you like that
I wanna know (Do you like that)
