Oh, boy
Mmm, just
Oh no, no, no
Touch me right there
Uh, oh, oh
Okay

You're so
You just don't know
What I'd do to you
If this situation were different
If we don't go (Go)
We'd be on this floor (Uh)
It'd be on for sure
It's too bad that we can't

You make me wanna do
Something I'd never do
Wanna go there with you
All the way there (Touch me there)
(Take me there with you)
Boy, I'm scared of you
Nothing compares to you
Boy, I'm not prepared to do it
You might also like
So, I can't love you (Right now)
Like I want to (Right now)
We just can't do it
And it's taking everything in me
I want to (Right now)
You know I want to (Right now)
But it's this one rule
(And it's keeping me from giving you my love)

I must admit
Baby, ooh, your kiss
It's taking my mind
To places that my body's never
Seen before
Make me want it more
I know you're hopin' that I bend a little
Give a little more, yeah

You make me wanna do (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Something I'd never do (Hey)
Wanna go there with you
All the way there (Touch me there)
(Take me there with you)
Boy, I'm scared of you
But nothing compares to you
But I won't do it
So, I can't love you (Right now)
Like I want to (Right now)
We just can't do it
And it's taking everything in me
I want to (Right now)
Know I want to (Right now)
But it's this one rule (Hey, yeah)
(And it's keeping me from giving you my love)

I wanna go all the way (Love)
But we gotta play it safe (Love)
We ain't doin' nothing if you
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Know (My love)
(My love)
(So, you just can't have my love)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

So, I can't love you (Right now)
Like I want to (Right now)
We just can't do it
It's taking everything in me
You know I want to (Right now)
But I gotta love you (Right now)
(I want to)
(And it's keeping me from giving you my love)
Right there, right there
Touch me there, right there
Ooh, there, there
Right there, right there
Ooh, no
No, right there
Right there, right there
