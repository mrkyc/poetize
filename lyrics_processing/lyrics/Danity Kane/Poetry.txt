When I stand in a crowded room
I feel alone like nobody's there
And when you talk cold to me
I can see your breath in the air
It's taking its toll on me
In the bathroom taking showers
So you don't see me cry
Baby, it's such a crime

I try to feel confident
I'm bitter, you're not making sense
I missed you till you almost took
My sanity, I started a new verse like

Poetry, you're hiding behind the
Words you speak, changing the words of
The story, you say you don't love me
Then, say that you love me, I'm fighting
You're hiding behind the words
You're speaking, you're changing the words
I'm lost in the verse, you say you don't love me
Then, say that you love me, what are you hiding
You might also like
Then, when I give you gratitude
You act like you don't hear me speak
And when I tell you what you do to me
You don't even hear the truth
What are you trying to prove
I stare out of the window for hours
'Cause you don't listen to me
You won't even look in my eyes

I try to feel confident
I'm bitter, you're not making sense
I missed you till you almost took
My sanity, I started a new verse like

Poetry, you're hiding behind the (Poetry)
Words you speak, changing the words of
The story, you say you don't love me (Story)
Then, say that you love me, I'm fighting (Oh)
You're hiding behind the words (Whoa-oh)
You're speaking, you're changing the words
I'm lost in the verse, you say you don't love me
Then, say that you love me, what are you hiding
Don't believe what you're saying (Saying)
I read your face and I'm blanking
'Cause I don't know what's in front of my eyes
Try to feel confident
I try to feel confident
I'm bitter, you're not making sense
I missed you till you almost took
My sanity

Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh

Huh (I'm starting a new verse like)

Poetry, you're hiding behind the (Poetry)
Words you speak, changing the words of (Words you speak)
