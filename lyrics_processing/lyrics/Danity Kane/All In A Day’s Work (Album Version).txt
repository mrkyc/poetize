All in a day's work
Damn, I'm so trill
All in a day's work
I made a mill while I cooked your meal
Kids 'em back and put you down next
Once or twice and still a bad ass bitch

What you doin'?
I'm making this shit look easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
I'm making this shit look easy
Please believe me, come and see me

What you doin', huh?

I got you, babe
I take care of my own
Telephone interview
While ironing your clothes
Multi-fascinating, classy, fine
Just know
That thing will be waiting
When you walk through that door

I'm breaking it, yes sir
I'm racking in some bacon
In some high heels and a skirt
I'm industry, I'm in the streets
I'm corporate and secure
I'm bossin' and you basic
And that there in just absurd
