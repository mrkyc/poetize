I'm riding around
My own world
Me and my girl
Meeting some friends
Getting it in
Just when a call comes through
It's been five accounts, four cars
Three cribs, two dogs
And a one year
Since the last time I spoke to you
Keep thinking about the last time
Do I say what's on my mind
Gave everything in my soul
Now I'm on to another life
And I promised I wouldn't let myself
Get caught up in a love so blind
Next time I'll do better
Do I run
Do I stay
Throw this whole shit away
Is it okay if I give you my heart again
Don't break it to pieces
You might also like(No, don't do it
Don't do it)
I'm on the edge of what I feel
Do I believe
Is all this real
You know the deal if I gave you my heart again
Don't break it to pieces
(Don't do it, no)
Got me thinking about you
Been so alone without you
I remember when I couldn't be without you
Sleep without you
I've been good
So good that I haven't thought about you
Now you brought it back
I don't want it back
Yeah I do
I'm confused
This shit ain't cool
Keep thinking about the last time
Do I say what's on my mind
Gave everything in my soul
Now I'm on to another life
And I promised I wouldn't let myself
Get caught up in a love so blind
Next time I'll do better
Do I run
Do I stay
Throw this whole shit away
Is it okay if I give you my heart again
Don't break it to pieces
(Don't do it)
I'm on the edge of what I feel
Do I believe
Is all this real
You know the deal if I give you my heart again
Don't break it to pieces
(Don't do it, no)
I be on that 50 cal
I blew all my tears away
See me on that ra ra shit
I be on my game day
I be on that 50 cal
I blew all my tears away
Tears away, tears away
I blew all my tears away
Do I run
Do I stay
Throw this whole shit away
Is it okay if I give you my heart again
Don't break it to pieces
(No, don't do it
Don't do it)
I'm on the edge of what I feel
Do I believe
Is all this real
You know the deal if I give you my heart again
Don't break it to pieces
