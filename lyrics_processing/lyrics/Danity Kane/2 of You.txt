Uh, uh-uh, uh, uh (Hey, boy, it's hot)
Uh, uh-uh, uh, uh

You make me hotter than Jamaica
Proceed with caution 'cause you're dangerous
(Maybe, it's) Maybe, it's just 'cause you're patient
'Cause every minute, boy, I'm tryna savor all

When you're passing by me, I just want to do
Every little thing she wouldn't do for you
How could anyone not fall in love with you
You're so good to me, I wish that I had you

You're so hot, there must be two of you
Boy, you got me having breakfast in the afternoon
When you take my body, up to the moon
It be feeling so good, it has to be two of you, uh oh
If you feel me, lemme hear it one time
If you feel me, lemme hear it two times
If you with me, lemme hear it three times
If you been there, lemme hear it four times

I don't care about your paper
Or how many gifts your pay for, oh
Don't worry 'bout me bringin' the bullsh-
'Cause this feels too good to funk it up, uh oh

Up in the air, yeah, do your dance

To see, c'mon and rock me

My name is Aubrey (What)
And I'm so cold (What)
My style is flashy (What)
Your style is old, ah-ah (Yeah)
'Cause I'm fly as hell with the juicy humps
I don't want your man 'cause I got enough
So, don't be mad at me
'Cause he be callin' my phone
I got my eye on one guy
Tell him leave me alone
He likes my personality
One of a kind, I'm so unique
I set the trend, you follow me
But this is one brings me to my knees

You're so hot, there must be two of you (Oh, so hot, yeah)
Boy, you got me having breakfast in the afternoon (Having breakfast in the afternoon)

If you been there, lemme hear it four times (Put your hands together, now)
