Lately, I've been tryna fight whatever's pulling us
Under, it's got a hold and really making me
Wonder what it takes to get through
I gotta stick with you, my baby
Baby, tell me, maybe I'm foolishly
Overreacting, but being without you
I can't imagine, it's just too close to the heart
And I won't stand it if were broken apart, oh no

Do you hear me, baby, you gotta believe in the
Things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you, I got your back now
When the chips are down and it seems like it's so hard for you to
Move ahead, just know that I am by your side
There ain't no if, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby

We've been cutting it close with the backwards and forwards
It's rocking the boat, we gotta get control of this
Let's take it back to three years ago
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever
And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Leaving was not an option, baby, never, never
Now, don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
In you is everything that I'm missing, so give us a chance, no
You might also like
Do you hear me, baby, you gotta believe in the
Things that make you and me win together (Everything that makes us win, baby)
Don't you throw in the towel (Don't you throw in the towel)
I'm keeping my promise to you, I got your back now (Oh, when the chips are down, yeah)
When your chips are down and it seems like it's so hard for you to (When nobody else knows that)
Move ahead, just know that I am by your side (I will be, yes, I will)
There ain't no if, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby (Ride for you, ooh, yeah, yeah)

Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it
Go, we been on top for too long
Just to let it go under
I don't wanna hear that, I just can't hear that
And know wherever you wanna take me
I'll go, I been with you for too long
To start over with another
I know that you hear me, just tell me you hear me

Do you hear me, baby, you gotta believe in the (You gotta believe in us)
Things that make you and me win together (Baby, don't give up on me)
Don't you throw in the towel (No-no, no-no)
I'm keeping my promise to you, I got your back now (No)
When your chips are down and it seems like it's so hard for you to (Oh, when the chips are down)
Move ahead, just know that I am by your side (I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be right there)
There ain't no if, buts, or maybes (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby (Oh-oh-whoa)
Whoa
Oh-oh-whoa
No, whoa
No, whoa-oh (I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby)
Oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh-whoa
No, whoa
No, whoa (I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby)
