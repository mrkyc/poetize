Oh (Oh-oh), you see me on your TV
You're tryna jump in your set (Set, set, set)
You got a load of me
And now, you have gettin' wet (Oh, so wet)
But you wish that I told you that
You was next, boy, I'll ring the bells
I'll make you sweat, you'll lose you breath

If you had a girl like me
How could you handle all this lovin'
I could make you work for free
I ain't lying (It ain't nothing)
I'm a hazard to your health
So, take caution, I swear
(You couldn't take it)
(Even if you're prepared)

I'm just tryna warn you (Hey, hey, hey)
I'ma heartbreaker
Even if I push up on you (Say, say, say)
I'ma heartbreaker
Even if you get my number (It don't matter)
I'ma heartbreaker
Don't even try to start
'Cause I will break your heart, I'ma heartbreaker

You buy them magazines
Just to read the words I (Sayin')
You're hanging where I hang
Just to get a glimpse of (Me)
I bet you're convinced I'm yours
But it ain't quite what you (Think)
Boy, slow down your roll, just pump your brakes
Pull down your brace, okay (Oh, okay, okay)

If you had a girl like me
You'd be acting up, dumb, crazy
I'ma save you from yourself
'Cause I know you can't take me
If you think you could be mine
Then, you bugging, I swear
(You couldn't handle it)
(Even if you were here)

I'm just tryna warn you (Hey, hey, hey)
I'ma heartbreaker
Even if I push up on you (Say, say, say)
I'ma heartbreaker
Even if you get my number (It don't matter)
I'ma heartbreaker
Don't even try to start ('Cause I'ma break your heart)
'Cause I will break your heart

Boy, think about it
Before you try me
'Cause if you got it
You wouldn't know what to do with me
Think about it
Before you try me

You wouldn't know what to do with me

I'm just tryna warn you (Hey, hey, hey)
