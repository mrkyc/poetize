I don't ever wanna leave your arms
When your holdin' me, I'm so
Caught up in the moment
Baby (Baby)
Whatever you tell me, I believe
You right away, when I play
Back the day I spent
With you, I wish I could

Since there's no way to rewind (Oh yeah)
Really wish we had more time (Oh yeah)
Fast forward through the hard times (The hard days)
Press pause on life
Really wanna feel like you're all mine (Really wanna feel like you're all mine)
Everything is fine (Everything is fine)
When you're here (When you're here)

Every problem, every issue
Doesn't matter when I'm with you
Boy, I'm so into you
My baby (Baby)
Every time we kiss, time just stops
Oh, I miss you and I
Think of days spent
With you, I wish I could
