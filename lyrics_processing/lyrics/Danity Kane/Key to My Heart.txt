Someone took the
Key to your heart
Someone took the
Key to your

Could've swore I had it
Right here with me
Since you told me no one else
Could take it away (Away)
So, maybe I misplaced it checking
Where it could be
But I'm running out of
Possibilities (Eeehs)

See, now me and him are having
All these problems
Retrace my steps
To see if I caused them
There's something he's
Keeping from me
What could it be, oh
(Please don't tell me)

Someone took the
Key to your heart
Right from up under me
Tearing us apart (Tearing us apart)
How could you just let
Anyone in (How could you do it, baby)
Into your
Heart

On the other side (Side)
When did I turn my back
Long enough for her to take my place (Place)
Must've been a mix up
Or is it a mistake
But if not when I see her
They might lock me away

'Cause now, me and him are having
All these problems
And it don't take a genius
To try and solve them
There's someone he's
Keeping from me, oh
Who could she be, oh
(Please don't tell me) Don't tell me
Someone took the
Key to your heart (Key to your heart, I can't take it)
Right from up under me (Ooh, hey)
Tearing us apart (Tearing us apart)
How could you just let (Ooh)
Anyone in (Don't you let them in, no)
Into your
Heart (Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa)

I've called it in
I made my claim
I hope they find it
Right away
The missing piece
Means everything
What else could it be
(Please don't tell me)

Someone took the (Someone took the)
Key to your heart (Key to your heart, ooh)
Right from up under me (Under me)
Tearing us apart (Tearing us apart)
How could you just let (Tearing us apart)
Anyone in
Into your
