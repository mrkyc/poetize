(Ooh, it's hot)

Love it when I'm flexin' up in my car
Door swing open for my passenger
Look up in the mirror, fix my mascara
People wanna know, "who the hell is her?"
Drop top, ridin' in my Coupe de Ville
I stay mobbing in my hooptie still
Rattle in the trunk when I play the track
Swerve to the left, yelling "holla back!"

Ooh, these haters got a sour ass look upon their face
Lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade
Ooh, they lookin' so thirsty, might just need a drink
Lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade

I feel your eyes on me
I like how it feels
I hope that you enjoy your five
But I'll take it from here
I'm late to the party, but I'm always on time
Misunderstood, but I'm always on your mind
You might also like
Who cares if we turn up every night
The top down when we pull up at the light
Don't listen to what nobody say
So loud, I can't hear nobody say nothing
I wish you would say something
While me and my girls is stuntin'
Ain't no problems here
See, I'm just trying to have me a good time

Ooh, these haters got a sour ass look upon their face
Lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade
Ooh, they lookin' so thirsty, might just need a drink
Lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade

I'm rockin' my sunnies
To block all that shade
We out here setting up shop
Slangin' lemonade
I'm late to the party, but I'm always on time
Misbehaving, always up to no good
Who cares if we turn up every night
The top down when we pull up at the light
Don't listen to what nobody say
So loud, I can't hear nobody say nothing
I wish you would say something
While me and my girls is stuntin'
Ain't no problems here
See, I'm just trying to have me a good time

Ooh, these haters got a sour ass look upon their face
Lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade
Ooh, they lookin' so thirsty, might just need a drink
Lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade

What you mad for? Is it me or nah?
The ice in my charm, baguette no flaws
I'm daddy T-Raww, trips 'round the world
I'm open arms to adore you, my chick's spoiled
Be loyal, lord I'm royal
Whippin' that Wraith, catch a case if they try follow
She top dollar, no advance, already got it
Intoxicated, faded
How we got home? Glad we made it
I know they hate it, smirk on their faces
Blue in the face, smurf faces
What I do for you, more than a bank statement
What she do for me? You know that tongue crazy
Mmm, I like that, I like that
I'm so serious, she get serious
Might bite that, don't bite that
I like that, go light that
Come right back, she right back
Oh you mad my chick bad?
Ooh, these haters got a sour ass look upon their face
Lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade
Ooh, they lookin' so thirsty, might just need a drink
Lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade

(Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade)
They might just need a drink
(Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade)
They might just need a drink
(Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade, lemonade)
Won't you have a drink
Lemonade, lemonade
Have a drink
Lemonade, lemonade, DK
Lemonade, lemonade
Yeah, they might just need a drink
