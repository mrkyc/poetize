Room full of mirrors, lost in my reflection
They just keep on going, going and going
A raging rep will come and through my directions
My fuse is blowing, blowing and blowing

And now I'm smiling at you
With these tears in my eyes
I wish I wouldn't cry
Now you're smiling at me
It's just fears in disguise
You now might die

You know that daddy's girl will always get away with it
Cause' you know that daddy's girl will always get her way so deal with it
So give me your love
All of your love
Give me your love
I want all of your love
Cause you know that daddy's girl never get enough of it

Rooms full of mirrors oh
But don't you like it
He see me good and all
I look it hood enough
You might also like
And now I'm taking over you
With these tears in my eyes
I wish I wouldn't cry
Tryna get over me
It's just fears in disguise
You now might die

You know that daddy's girl will always get away with it
Cause' you know that daddy's girl will always get away so deal with it
So give me your love
All of your love
Give me your love
I want all of your love
Cause you know that daddy's girl never get enough of it

I could just watch you fall
And I don't know why
I don't know why
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
I can't love you good, I can't love you good
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
I can't love you good, I can't love you good
You know that daddy's girl will always get away with it
Cause' you know that daddy's girl will always get away so deal with it
So give me your love
All of your love

Cause you know that daddy's girl never get enough of it
