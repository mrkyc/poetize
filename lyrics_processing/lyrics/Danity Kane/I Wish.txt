When you say that you were leavin'
I didn't understand the reason
And all I wanted was to keep you here
'Cause you know I really need you here, oh
And you know I ain't been sleepin'
'Cause I really can't believe it
Can't believe that you would walk right out that door
And say that you don't want me no more

(I was out of my mind, I was sick of being tied up)
Didn't spend time at home
(And now, I wish I was the one that you was calling)
Baby, won't you pick up the phone 'cause I wish

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish that I was
Still your girl (Wish I was)
(Still your girl, still your girl)
I miss your lips, your touch, your kiss
I wish, I wish, I wish that I was
Still your girl (I need to have you)
(Here with me, I wish I was still your girl)
You might also like
It ain't like I didn't know it
I just didn't take the time to show it
And now, every day you're on my mind
I wish that I could press rewind
Can you take me back, I'm hopeless
'Cause this time I wouldn't blow it
Boy, I feel like I'm about to go insane
I wish I had my baby

(I was out of my mind, I was sick of being tied up)
Didn't spend time at home
(And now, I wish I was the one that you was calling)
Baby, won't you pick up the phone 'cause I wish

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish that I was
Still your girl (Wish I was)
(Still your girl, still your girl)
I miss your lips, your touch, your kiss
I wish, I wish, I wish that I was
Still your girl (I need to have you)
(Here with me, I wish I was still your girl)
Always finding numbers in my two way, going out clubbin'
Staying out late at night (Wasn't tryna play a little late)
I'm sorry for running game now
I'm wishing I could make it right ('Cause I know)
I really need you (Really need your love)
In my life (Need you here with me)
(Ooh, boy)
(Now, I gotta pay the price and I)

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish that I was
Still your girl (Wish I was)
(Still your girl, still your girl)
I miss your lips, your touch, your kiss
I wish, I wish, I wish that I was
Still your girl (I need to have you)
