Shoulders down, leg out
Bend over, lips pout
Bat eyes, show thigh
Lift them up, don't touch

I got a proposition
If you want it (If you want it)
Dare you to let me run some
Game on you (Game on you)
Undress me with your eyes
You're in for a surprise
What's underneath my
Exteri-eri-erior

You do your best to put your
Name on it (Name on it)
But you could never put your
Claim on it (Claim on it)
Create your fantasies
Which role you wanna be
Check the reflection in the
Mirror-irror-irror
You might also like
I know you like it
The way I do it private
You can't deny it, just wanna
Please you, blow out your candle
In my birthday suit surprise
Just let me make your night
I'll do you like you like, I'll fulfill
Your needs, keep your tip, this one's on me

Tell you on your best behavior
Slowly, I remove all my
Articles of clothing and I
Let you come and sneak a peak
What's behind door number three
Take off your blindfold to see
Clear-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar-ar
The walls are talking 'bout the
Things we doing (Things we doing)
Flip me and try an
Acrobatic movement (Dip it, flip it)
This is the center ring
Come on, come on, let's see
The main attraction like the
Ringling Brother-ther-ther-thers

It's so erotic, get close
I got a pocket full of candy
With your favorite flavor
You can have it now or later
Don't you wanna taste
Don't got no time to waste

So sweet and it's good enough to eat, yeah

Shoulders down, leg out
Bend over, lips pout
Bat eyes, show thigh
Lift them up, don't touch

From falling down
And we only got tonight
So, make it count (We do)
And I got you on the
Edge of your seat (Seat)
