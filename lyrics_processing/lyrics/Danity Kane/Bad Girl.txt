When the red light comes on, I transform
When the red light comes on, I transform

Look in my eyes covered in Maybelline
Looking like something fresh out a magazine
I can be part of your deepest fantasies
You're the detective, come solve my mystery

Some say that love is all that I'm missing
Some call it Jezebel, I call it attention
But what they don't know, they can't even imagine
Say I don't have no self-esteem, but it's my fashion

Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl
I can be your addiction
If you wanna get hooked on me
I-I can be your addiction
If you wanna get hooked on me
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

Something about me has got you hypnotized
Examine my body like you're the science guy
Watching my every move, you anticipate
What you thinking about, boy, I can recreate

Some say that love is all that I'm missing
Some call it Jezebel, I call it attention
But what they don't know, they can't even imagine
Saying I don't have no self-esteem, but it's my fashion

Maybe I'm just a bad girl

I know you hear me, boy, B-A-D C-H-I-C
Lookin' so sexy, make 'em bitches hate me
She not me 'cause there just one me
I'm the M to the I, double S, Y, E
Lights come on, I tran-transform
Gimme that dick, baby, come, come on
I can do it all night till the break of dawn
On, on, and on, I keep on goin'
They call me a Jezebel
'Cause I freaks, I does it well
Got extensions in my hair
Bad girls, is y'all up in here (Yeah)
Tonight, we gon' just let it do what it do
I can pimp this pretty young thang on you
I ain't lookin' for attention, I just want you
Let me be your addiction, I can be that too
I can be your addiction
If you wanna get hooked on me
I-I can be your addiction
If you wanna get hooked on me
Maybe I'm just a bad girl
Maybe I'm just a bad girl

Maybe I'm just a bad girl, a bad girl

From a caterpillar to a butterfly
I know I got something that you're gonna like
