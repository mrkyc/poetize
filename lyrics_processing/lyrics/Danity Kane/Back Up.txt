Big boy, I like
The way you be lookin' at me
It be drivin' me crazy and I like
Every time you up in my ear
You be talkin' all sexy, show me
'Cause I don't ever wanna look past you, baby
I'm curious if you can shake me, baby
Can you really make me go

(And if you think you can handle it, then show me what you workin' with) Yeah, yeah
(And let me know before we get down)
Before you get up on it, uh
Before I let you get up on it, no, no, no, no, no

I can't fight it, you makin' me sweat
And I can't hide it, I really like it
But if you can't get it jumpin', you better back up off of me
And if you really don't want it, you better back up off of me
I can't fight it, you makin' me sweat
And I can't hide it, I really like it
But if you can't get it jumpin', you better back up off of me
And if you really don't want it, you better back up off of me
