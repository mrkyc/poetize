Baby don't cry, cry baby
Rockabye, bye bye baby

If I told you love was blind
And it wasn't worth my time
Would you still love me
The way that you do
If I was always with my girls
Poppin' bottles by myself
Would you still claim me
The way that you do ooh boo
It might look easy
But it's hard to walk in my shoes
Boy please don't complain
When I flip the script up on you

Cause baby there's more, more
More out there to love than just you
(Baby there's more)
Since I can afford more
I don't have to settle for you
Don't cry baby
You might also like
Baby don't cry, cry baby
Baby don't cry, cry baby, baby, baby
Baby don't cry, cry baby
Rockabye, bye bye baby, baby, baby 

If I always got my way
Had you pay for my mistakes
Would your heart truly love me for real
Baby if we were trading places
Would you still be waiting
Accepting all the things that you deal yeah yeah

It might look easy
But it's hard to walk in my shoes
(Had to walk in my shoes)
Boy please don't complain
When I flip the script up on you
(Baby there's more)

Cause baby there's more, more
More out there to love than just you
Since I can afford more
I don't have to settle for you
Don't cry baby
Baby don't cry, cry baby
Baby don't cry, cry baby, baby, baby
Baby don't cry, cry baby
Rockabye, bye bye baby, baby, baby 

If I gave you all my love
Would you die for me
Ride or die for me, baby
If I gave you all my trust
Would you die for me
Ride or die for me
You don't wanna let go
But I'm letting go
I know you don't wanna let go
But I let you go 

Cause baby there's more, more
More out there to love than just you
Since I can afford more
I don't have to settle for you
(Don't cry baby)
Cause baby there's more, more
More out there to love than just you
Since I can afford more
I don't have to settle for you
(Don't cry baby)
Baby don't cry, cry baby
Baby don't cry, cry baby, baby, baby
Baby don't cry, cry baby
Rockabye, bye bye baby, baby, baby 

Baby don't you cry
