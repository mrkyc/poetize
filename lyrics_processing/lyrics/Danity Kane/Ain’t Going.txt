Yeah, yeah, here we go

I know we got everybody waiting
To see just how we do
I'm tellin' you we going hard
Mix it up with some old school and a little new

We'll make you jump right out of your seat
Make you lose your mind when you feel that beat
It's just begun
And we ain't going nowhere, going nowhere, oh
You might also like
Ooh, this ain't nothing like you heard before
We're gonna have you wanting more
Like it is when you're with your girl
Or ladies with your man
This is our chance to make you move
Ooh, we'll be right there, right there

I know you feel it (Feel it)
And it's making you not wanna stop
You might as well lose yourself
Let it go, cause we gonna just keep giving you what you want
This is not a game, turn the music up and let it play our song
And we ain't goin' nowhere, goin' nowhere

Ooh, this ain't nothing like you heard before
We're gonna have you wanting more
Like it is when you're with your girl
Or ladies with your man
This is our chance to make you move

Ooh, this ain't nothing like you heard before
We're gonna have you wanting more
Like it is when you're with your girl
Or ladies with your man
This is our chance to make you move
Ooh, we'll be right there, right there
Hold up, we about to make it official
Put your drinks in the air and take it straight to the dance floor

Lose yourself and let the music control you
You owe yourself to let go
We've got everything you need, what you're looking for

You don't have to look no more
(You don't have to look no more)

Ooh, this ain't nothing like you heard before
We're gonna have you wanting more
Like it is when you're with your girl
Or ladies with your man
This is our chance to make you move
