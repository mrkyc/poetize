Get it

So, you say that you don't
Think that me and him gon' last
And you say that I need to
Think about the past when that chick was
Callin', playin' on my phone
Four in the mornin', talkin' (No)
It's about to be on
If she don't back up off me

And now, you say that I changed
And you don't like how I get down
Tellin' him I ain't even
Gonna stick around just 'cause
You see me on the TV
You think I'ma leave my baby just (Because)
I'm sitting next to Diddy

So, tell me what you on
Tell me what the hell you want
Need to worry 'bout your own
I'ma have to put you on blast
Cause we look so fresh together
Can't nobody do it better
(And I don't care what they say)
(I'm gon' stay with my baby)
You might also like
Tell me why you in my B-I-Z
You're gonna make me get my vasoline
You don't wanna catch the third degree
Back up, I need fifty feet
I don't think you really want it
I don't think you really want it
I don't think you really want it
I don't think you really want it

I peeped game when you said
That is not the right man for me
But real talk, you just wanna
Get wit my man, you know you
Stay blowin' up his cell
On the regular day to day
I know you feeling him

So, tell me what you on
Tell me what the hell you want
Need to worry 'bout your own
I'ma have to put you on blast
Cause we look so fresh together
Can't nobody do it better
(And I don't care what they say)
(I'm gon' stay with my baby)
Tell me why you in my B-I-Z (Hey)
You're gonna make me get my vasoline (Don't make me get)
You don't wanna catch the third degree (Hey)
Back up, I need fifty feet (Hey)
I don't think you really want it (Want it)
I don't think you really want it (Want it)
I don't think you really want it
I don't think you really want it (I don't think you really want it)

(You mad 'cause he with me)
(And you ain't get him first)
(He told me his homie)
(Said that you was the worst)
You ain't gettin' it like I'm gettin'
You ain't pimpin' like I'm pimpin'
Hope you don't think I'm listenin'
This what you sound like to me

Breeze blowing in the
Wind, baby, please
Believe I'm the
One (Baby, please believe)
Cause it's seventy degrees
And sunny over here (So, you)
You can stay up out my
Ear (Hey, yeah)
Tell me why you in my B-I-Z (Tell me why, you lie)
You're gonna make me get my vasoline (Why you in my B-I-Z)
You don't wanna catch the third degree
Back up, I need fifty feet (Woo, oh)
I don't think you really want it (Want it)
I don't think you really want it (Want it)
I don't think you really want it
