Mostly working at the mill
And other than his wife
A single dream is his only thrill
Gotta get away, gotta see the land
Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man
Gotta get away, gotta see the land
Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man
In the evening when the sun begins to fade
And work is over, and supper is too
A shabby guitar case comes out from underneath the bed
And Country John will do his dues, say now

Between the moonshine and the shining of the moon
And his sway back a woman by his side
And he would soon find that the lining of his tomb
From way back was too hard to divide, say now
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) Leaving
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) In the morning
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) Leaving
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) Got your woman
You might also like(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) So much
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) I have taken
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) So much
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) Is forsaken
Gotta get away, gotta see the land
Gotta see the world, gotta be a man
Gotta get away, gotta see the land
Gotta see the world, gotta be a man
All the others and the young folk too
Rock with John while he did his dues
The moonshine and the shadows through the pine
They all rocked with John too
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) So much
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) As I'm leavin'
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) So much
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) I am leavin'
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) So much
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) I have taken
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) So much
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) Is forsaken
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) Leaving
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) In the morning
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) Leaving
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) Got your woman
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) Too much
(Gotta see the world, gotta be a man, man) I have taken
(Gotta get away, gotta see the land) Too much
