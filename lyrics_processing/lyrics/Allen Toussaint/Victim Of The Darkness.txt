What will they do
What will they do
Victims of the darkness
What will they do
What will they do
Victims of the darkness
They don't see the light
Till it's too late, you know
To put up a fight
But they know there's something there
That they don't see
But what to do about
What's supposed to be, no no
Victims of the darkness
What will they do
What will they do
Victims of the darkness
What will they do
What will they do
Victims of the darkness
They don't understand
Till both two feet are sunk
Too deep in the sand
You might also likeBut they know there's something there
That they don't see
But what is done about
What's supposed to be
Now there's a man with a plan
With a pencil in his hand
And he's strong about it
So he write a song about it
Now there's a man with a plan
With a pistol in his hand
Is he right about it
Tell me should he fight about it
There's a man with a plan
With a Bible in his hand
Is he sure about it
What does he know about it
Now there's another man with a plan
With your future in his hand
Can you live without him
What can you do about him, no no
Victims of the darkness
What will they do
What will they do
Victims of the darkness
What will they do
What will they do
Victims of the darkness
They don't see the light
Till it's too late, you know
To put up a fight
But they know there's something there
That they don't see
But what is done about
What's supposed to be
Mercy
Victims of the darkness
What will they do
What will they do
Victims of the darkness
What will they do
