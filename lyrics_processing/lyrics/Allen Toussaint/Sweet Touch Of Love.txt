That's the sweet touch of love
Oh, when just the drop of a name begins to sting your very toe
That's the sweet touch of love, oh yes it is
Just the thought about seeing you would blow my mind
Oh, that's the sweet touch of love, oh yes it is
I was about to give up but you came just in time
With your sweet touch of love, oh yes you did
You brought out the best in me
Made me leave the rest of me behind, oh yes you did
You delivered me from loneliness
And onliness, oh yes, and oh little girl
One little kiss to let me know, girl
That I couldn't live without your love, you know it's true
I've found the joy that I had been missing for so long
It was the sweet touch of love, oh yes it was
When a cold chill begins to thrill your very soul
That's the sweet touch of love, oh yes it is
When just the drop of a name begins to sting your very toe
That's the sweet touch of love, oh yes it is
Mmm, mmm yeah
You might also likeYou know that there's nothing that's sweeter than you
I got to have you early in the morning
And when the icy winds a-blow on and on
I don't need no clothes, I don't need no coat
I got you early in the morning
I got you, yeah, late in the afternoon
I got you, yeah, late in the evening too
I got you
Now whenever my love comes tumbling down
You know you got to be there
You can use the rest of this world of mine
You know you got to be there
When my love comes tumbling down
You know you got to be there
When my love comes tumbling down
