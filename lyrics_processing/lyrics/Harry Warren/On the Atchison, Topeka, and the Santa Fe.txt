Do ya hear that whistle down the line?
I figure that it's engine number 49
She's the only one that'll sound that way
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe
See the old smoke risin' 'round the bend
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend
Folks around these parts get the time of day
From the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe
Here she comes

Whoo whoo whoo whoo hoo

Hey, Jim you'd better get the rig

Whoo whoo whoo whoo hoo

She's got a list o' passengers that's pretty big

And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots o' them been travelin' for quite a spell
All the way to Cal-i-for-ni-ay
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe

Oh, the roads back east are mighty swell
The Chesapeake, Ohio, and the ASL
{STOKER]
But I make my run and I make my pay
{ENGINEER AND STOKER]
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe

Goin' back and forth along these aisles
My man, you must have walked about a million miles

It's a treat to be on your feet all day

On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe

Here she comes!
Rat a-rat a-rat a-rat a-rat
She's really racin' down the line
Looky looky looky look look look
Oh boy, we're huffin' and a puffin' on the 49
In this day and age, girls don't leave home
But if you get a hankerin' and want to roam
Our advice to you is, run away
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe

Hey men, did you ever see
Such purty femininity
Arrivin' all at once in this here town?
In this here town?
Never saw the likes of this for miles around

Round and round our heads are spinning
New adventures are beginning

What a length of calico
It's taffety and calico to really put a cowboy on the kibosh

Cowboy, kibosh

It's enough to make a fella wanna wash
Wash your face and hands, we hope
You'll never be afraid of soap

Buttoned shoes and powdered chalk
And fancy smells and baby talk
It's awful what a gal will stoop to do

Even so, we aim to say
We love to honor and oh, ba-
By, are there any more at home like you?

Wahoo!
Hand me my hair comb and my slicker
Gonna get spruced up and I'll pick her
Put on the dog and I'll city-slick her
Mister Harvey, Mister Harvey
Fred Harvey knows exactly how to pick 'em

We come from Dubuque, I-o-way
That's where the tall, tall, tall corn grows
We come from Louisiana
Where the Missississippi flows

I was the Lillian Russell of Cherryville, Kansas
But they never gave me a chance

I finished high school in Providence, Rhode Island
And Providence, Rhode Island is where I learned to dance

Oh, I'm from Chillicothe

Ohio!

My middle name's Hiawa-thee

Ohio!

I'm gonna get the gold in them thar hills
So I said goodbye-o, Ohio

We were schoolmarms in Grand Rapids, Mich.,
But reading, writing, 'rithmetic were not our dish

I was born in Paris
I was raised in Paris
Went to school in Paris
Where I met a boy
I was married in Paris
Almost buried in Paris
But I finally left Paris

Paris, Illinois!

So this is the wild woolly West
Give me my chaps and my checkered vest
Give me a girl and a holster for my hip
Bang, bang! Yip, yip!

What a lovely trip
I'm feeling so fresh and alive
And I'm so glad to arrive
It's all so grand
It's easy to see
You don't need a palace
To feel like Alice
In Wonderland
Back in Ohio, where I come from
I've done a lot of dreamin' and I've traveled some
But I never thought I'd see the day
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe
I would lean across my windowsill
And hear the whistle echoin' across the hill
Then I'd watch the lights till they'd fade away
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe
What a thrill
What a great big wonderful thrill
With the whistle singin' "Westward Ho"
Right from the day I heard it start
'Cross the Kansas plains to New Mexico
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart
When I'm old and gray and settled down
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town
Then I'll spend my busman's holiday
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe
All aboard, all aboard
Here she comes
Whoo whoo whoo whoo hoo
I can't believe we're here at last

When you go traveling it's best for you
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe

I can't believe that anything could go so fast
When you pull that throttle, whistle blows
A huffin' and a puffin' and away she goes
All aboard for Cal-i-for-ni-ay
On the Atchison
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka, and
