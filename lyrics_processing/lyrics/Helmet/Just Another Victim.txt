But you're in bed
Stumble out
And run dead
If it ever paid
To self-start
Environment
Make you smart
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim, kid
I heard it once
But not before
Begging off
And livin' bored
My hands are tied
Webbed feet again
Fell in behind
And claim us dead
Just another victim
Just another victim, kid
Just another victim

In spite of truth
Give it up
I'll lie to you
Blame and flame this
Turn it, start
Pointed finger
You fall apart
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim
You played yourself
Now you're pointin' fingers
How I've robbed and raped ya
Bruised and scraped ya
But those are just lies
'Cause in your eyes
You've been victimized
It's how you size it up
You disguise it up
And try to make it look real
To cover up the low self esteem you feel
Introspection, an afterthought
Swimmin' in guilt's your favorite sport
But now you're caught up in the undertow
You never knew a man could sink so low
But now you know
'Cause you're John Doe
In a black bag
A tag on your toe
I built the house
I felt the pain
You're victimized
But got no one to blame
Just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
Just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
Holy diver, I'm a survivor
Feeling like De Niro in Taxi Driver
With Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel
Looks like I'm walkin' through a livin' Hell
So spark that owl and I'll get lifted
Feelin' the effects of what my spliff did
'Cause I'm gifted
I read Sun Tzu
I bought a gun too, so you'll never come too
The weight of the world ridin' on my shoulders
'Cause I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya
You're just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
You're just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
You're just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
You're just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim
