They say he's like me if ahh, I played Zelda a lot more
Would masturbate to anime and not watch sports
Lived off Red Bull, Redman, Pop Tarts, popcorn
Watched porn, made a sandwich, got bored sooo watched porn
If I was ugly and trifle, run from a fight, had none of my height
Oh wait, thank God, we're nothing alike
So I'm rolling down the street in a Jeep with my peeps
The car goes "beep" and we all yell "freak!"
Yo, you're the type I'm fucking with
For the fucking fun of it
You can try to say your jokes but I will just have none of it
Geek, loser, crystal meth abuser
Kansas City fitted is what I use to wipe my pooper
Yo, and that nose looks pretty hooked if you take a look at that
Shit I bet it buys you hookers whenever your puss is waxed
Shit I bet it writes your hooks whenever you book a track
I said, "Hook him in his nose" but I know I'd hook me back
Yo, y'all threw Daniel in the Lion's Den and now your Daniel's done
Thinking Caustic is a Karate Kid well get your Daniel son'd
And if you know your bowl of history there's no way around it
Cause dude loogied on you afterwards and you just stood astounded
So I can rest assured that if I am surrounded
I can fucking spit on you and you won't do shit about it

Yo, fuck the jokes for a second
Y'all wanna hear some shit that's actually true?
Your boy Adam Farone went to St. Josephs Prep, that's an all boys Catholic school
Now, that's a pretty good indication why in the streets you aren't seen
You weren't built to do wrong things
Except for that one time your high school prom had two prom kings
Now, we all know what those priests did and I think Rone's got some secrets
I mean, while you were holding rosary beads while stroking a penis did you feel any closer to Jesus?
You're abstinent by choice
Any time a bitch tries to give this guy love
He hits her with a Christian side hug
And a t-shirt that says "Friendship is my drug"
Yo, you can try to ball your fists but I'm marvelous
Living proof that God exists
It's not my fault your parents believed in retarded shit
Your family car has a Darwin fish
So who the fuck is speeding up the beat of your drum?
You keep rapping that fast you're gonna start bleeding from gums
Either this freak is on speed and unbelievably spun
Or the resurrection of Jesus come and he's speaking in tongues
Yo, so don't trip Adam, one day the right rapper show is gonna call you back
Until then kid, I'll catch you in the next round
Hallelujah holler back
You might also like
Yo, you can't bolt past Usain Bolt
Think of your kids Caustic
You gon' Rodan the Roman? You're just a kid Caustic
G.O.A.T., you're a kid Caustic
I Casper wack rappers, you've never seen Kids Caustic?
Yo, you made up that sick name which is just fine to do
Thinking I'm autistic, but cool, I'll just combine the two
But I'm dissing you motherfucker, be smart listen
He said, "What? I thought you just called me 'artistic?"
No, I'm calling you mildly retarded dawg
Ayo, you got a wop for a wifey, well my plans for her are pretty big
I'll bring her back to my lab and experiment on the guinea pig
Or I'll hacky sack in half with an ax yes
Pain is involved but you can't get mad at that, ask Sat, I'm just breaking your balls
I'll smash his ass with Reggie Jackson's bat to deep home stands
When that sweet oak lands you're in east Oakland
Yo, you moved to Jersey for the Shore
You measly, weak fuck
Trying to beat me up
The way he beats the beat up
Well I hope your blow out blows out and your bicep pops
And on your way to go tanning you get shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot

None of these Youtube haters say that comedy's repetitive
But all my opponents got for me is nose jokes and awkward comparisons
I don't think you faggots will be happy 'til I'm stocking your relatives
Not that it's relative but your sister's name is Stephanie Ferrone
And goes to school in Baltimore Maryland
She's a physics major with a minor in French and religious studies
And she looks exactly like this guy so I guarantee that bitch is ugly
Come on Bobby Bushay, with all the beer pong that you play
You probably say that college is great
But after you polish a keg and some ganja is blazed
You can't walk on your legs like Macauley Culkin in Saved
Yo, be lost in a haze, bragging about how many shots of Vodka you take
And probably get raped after you vomit and prayed
You don't wake up the following day with dicks drawn on your face
Bitch, I've been waiting for you to start a problem all night
Who would want to not fight someone who talks like Walter Cronkite?
Yo, you wanna debate with words? Okay, but you're too squeamish
The way that you use English sounds like you're related to Newt Gingrich
Yo, I will burn down any radio station that puts your music on
And how fucking dare you come to this battle dressed up like Olivia Newton John?
Let's get physical!
Yo, I'll out write you, then out white you
You don't want to mess with me
We can take it to the b-ball courts and see who's better fundamentally
Yo, from John Mayer to lawn care, I look better in a sweater
Having tools, grammar rules
Politically correct answers, wittier dinner banter
Yo, propane igniting and creative writing
Hiking, biking, pretty much any white thing
Yo, I'm the Don like Quixote
You're the don at Chipotle
Rotisserie wrist, watch the middle finger rotate
Champagne, fruit of Rozay
No say
No way
All I know is your nose will be okay for crochet
Yo, and I'm trying to do my best but look at what I'm comparing with
Cause he'll just yell "AIDS" and his camps like "THAT'S FUCKING HILARIOUS!"
Yo, but karma's a harsh mistress, so watch what you say bitch
Cause I hear Fate's gay and a rapist, likes beards and has Aids dick
So check the soundbites duke cause it's downright true
I agree, Rap's A Joke, cause of clowns like you

This ain't the 80's jerk
What the fuck? Peter Brady came to bang his turf
That was a pretty crazy verse considering it just came out of Brainy Smurf
So don't front like your midterms don't have you pressured and stressed
Your life ain't been shit but pencils and desk and professors and tests
You and the rest of your friends bring desperate attempts
To get on MTV as a guest
You look like one of those contestants on Next to get sent back to the bus in the first seven seconds or less
Front like you ain't a wop bitch
You'll get wrapped in the plastic from your mother's furniture
I'm a professional cold blooded murder
You're a professional Bone Thugs interpreter
And I'm gonna miss everybody
Who the fuck told you was illy? That's silly
Shit got you really amped
I was a little gassed myself, I thought I was gonna get a Philly cat
You ain't Philly bitch  three dollars in Gilead
You more Vinnie Paz than Cassidy
Fuck, even Freeway is feeling that
Yo, I got peas on my mind like I'm sporting a Philly's cap
You couldn't show me your city's trap if I showed you a Philly map
So faggots like Rone and ZM are supposed to bring Philly back
