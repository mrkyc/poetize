Well, I got caught between boredom and anger
A hammer came to the party to blind
All of my confidence, it had a warrant
Knocked on the door and split open my mind

What are we doing? Who are these people?
How did we let them get a word in edgewise?

Well, I'm not looking for forgiving ties
I'm just looking for a way to survive
I and I
No, I'm not looking for forgiving ties
I'm just looking for a way to survive
I and I
For me, for you and then for them, too

Well, I got stuck in a state of reluctance
My hand was bitten by the mouth that it fed
I tried to slip back into the bathroom
A thought approached me as my fingers bled

Who are these people? How do they see me?
Would they get up if I let them down now?

No, I'm not looking for forgiving ties

If they survive every buried disorder
And come to terms with a life on the ledge
Well, I could be kind to myself in the mortar
And take a moment with the hammer again

Who are you fooling? You're just a turnstile
I know the way and I can see myself down the line

Well, I'm not looking for forgiving ties
Oh, I'm just looking for a way to survive
I and I
Well, I'm not looking for forgiving ties
Oh, I'm just looking for a way to survive
I and I
Well, I'm not looking for forgiving ties
And I'm just looking for a way to survive
