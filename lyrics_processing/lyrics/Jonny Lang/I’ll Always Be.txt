Hand to heart the music starts, the tune for you
The universe where we rehearse, our stage, the earth
And now, the final curtain call, so soon is heard
The band begins, the music blends, and still, you do not dance
From mezzanine, I watch you leave, no room, for chance
And in the dark, I wait for you to come to me
No flame, no spark, I wonder will this ever be
Even though this is not the plan
And you think it's a one night stand
And you say you want no part of me
And they claim you no longer dance
And they say that we're both has-beens
I'll always be, I'll always be
I'll always be, I'll always be, I'll always be
We turn, the page, love grows from hate, love grows
You act your age, so filled with rage, and so it goes
Slowly as the song expands, I let you lead
And reluctantly your hand you reach, oh let this be
Even though this is not my plan
And you think it's a one night stand
And know you're not in love with me
Even though this is not romance
I can't admit this is my last chance
Like a schoolboy chasing a fantasy
I'll always be, I'll always be
I'll always be, I'll always be, I'll always be
The plane, the car, the fame, the star, the life anew
The carousel, the ride, the meals, are all on you
How do I make you understand?
This is much more than a one night stand
It's the house, it's the kids, it's everything
This is love and there's no plan B
There's only you, and there's only me
Where you are, that's where I'll always be
I'll always be
I'll always be, I'll always be, I'll always be
