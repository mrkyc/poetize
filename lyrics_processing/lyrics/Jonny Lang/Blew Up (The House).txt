Listen, I looked around saw nothing but my soul missing
So I hit the switch took out everything but the kitchen
Like a couple of fish flopping down on the floor
Wait a minute, engines and sirens all up in a roar
Fire chief said son, what you want to do this for?
I am sorry sir I just can't take it no more
(Yeah)
You wouldn't have liked the man I was before
So I blew up the house
Gonna let it burn (alright)
Gonna let it burn (ooohhh)
Gonna let it burn down
Baby, I blew up the house
Just to watch it burn
(Just to watch it burn)
Gonna let it burn down (alright)
Let it burn down (wooo)
Listen
Now they check your pulse just to see if you can still breathe
I was barely alive apparently for no good reason
All this before I had been thinking the same way
Sometimes it's better just to start again
