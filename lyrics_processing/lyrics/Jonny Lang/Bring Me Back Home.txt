It won't let me be, it's keeping me awake at night
It's got me thinkin' 'bout all of these crazy things
That I don't wanna think
It just ain't me
Don't think I wouldn't give my life to have you near
Please don't think twice about us dear
I know it's been a while so I'll make it clear
That it ain't that house we live in
And it ain't that ride I've been fixin'
It's just you babe, that brings me back home
I've got to get off this road I've traveled
Sometimes it's more than I can handle
I need you babe, to bring me back home
Tired of living my life so many miles away
I need to touch you babe, too far away
Tired of all of these bootleggers giving me away for free
And leave my soul to be
I need to be redeemed
But listen, I still sit and think about that very night
The first time it all sank in, your face, your smile, all mine
You got to know it ain't that house we live in
And it ain't that ride I've been fixin'
It's just you babe, that brings me back home
I've got to get off this road I've traveled
Sometimes it's more than I can handle
I need you babe, to bring me back home
I need you baby, to bring me back home, child

And it ain't that ride I'm fixin'
It's just you babe, that brings me back home
I've got to get off this road I've traveled
Too much of me, these lights, my shadow
I need you babe, to bring me back home, yes I do
I had to let you know, had to let you know, I had to let you know baby, I'm coming home
It's been too long and I need your love, yes I need your love, I need your love, yeah
I do, I do, I do, I do...
