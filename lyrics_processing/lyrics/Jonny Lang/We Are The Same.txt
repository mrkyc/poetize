From a long dream
And though we drink the same cup
Some of us
Still thirsty
Show your heart, a show of hands
If ever had a story you couldn't tell
We'll you're not alone (well you're not alone, we'll you're not alone)
It fell apart sing and sing
Life is hard I understand
I got one of my own (I got one of my own, I got one of my own)
Yeah, read a book it blew mine
I guess I didn't see what was between the lines (what was between the lines)
Or where the story(or where the story was)
Yeah, from my heart I lost my way
Only thing we stood for like every day
It ain't holding up (it ain't hold up, it ain't holding up)
So now then we settle down
There's no fight left in us
We just got to give it up
Cause we have the perfect love
Yeah, just got to give it up
Cause we have the perfect love
The world keeps spinning around
Another sun goes down
And still we're sleeping in this bed we made
But tonight I dream again
And in a dream I see in you
No shame, we are the same
Lost your job times are tight
Trying to hold it down do us right
Heavy on your mind
Yeah, got into trouble took a drink
Trying to wash away the same stain
Just a cup of wine (just a cup of wine)
I remember a day when were young
Always heard a change was gonna come (I wondered)
Is it too late (is it too late)
We're all hard on what we believe in
Even though we keep reaching thicker skin
But there's a better a way
Why don't we just lay the weapons down
Never should have picked them up
Look who's the big man now don't need to act so tough
We've got the perfect love
We've got the perfect love
We've got the perfect love
We've got the perfect love
Oh, the world
The world is spinning round (spinning around)
The sun goes down
And still we're sleeping in this bed we made
Tonight I dream again
And in my dream I see in you, no shame
We are the same
And as we turn the tide
And learn to live with no disguise
No pain only love remains
At last the sun will rise
And we'll walk in the light as one some day
We are
Oh we are
We are all waking up
To a life that we've never seen
From the dust rising up we'll finally see the
The sun
Oh, the world
The world is spinning round (spinning around)
Another sun goes down
And still we're sleeping in this bed we made (and still sleeping in this bed we made)
Tonight I dream again (oh tonight I dream again)
And in my dream I see in you, no shame
We are the same
And as we turn the tide
And learn to live with no disguise (live with no disguise)
No pain only love remains (no pain, only love, only love)
At last the sun will rise
And we'll walk in the light as one some day
We are
Oh we are
