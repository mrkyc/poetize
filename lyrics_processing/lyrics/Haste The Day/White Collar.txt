Can't you understand I feel this?
This is nothing
I can see my reflection in your cheek bone
We've been playing out this script in your mind
Here we go with a fresh perspective
You'll paint the walls with your stone face tactics
And we'll walk around
Eyes on the crowd
And don't you think about tomorrow
You shut me out
I just don't want to fake it anymore
I'm burning out
Your motions empty and you've hit the floor
You shut me out
The sweet relief of saying, you shield your heart from breaking
Get up, get out now
Get up, get out
In the glow of the moonlight serenade
Unleash the knowledge of the white collar escapade
Speak the words that unlock the truth
And you'll paint the walls
You'll paint the walls
We'll walk around
Eyes on the crowd
Don't you think about tomorrow

I just don't want to fake it anymore
I'm burning out
Your motions empty and you've hit the floor
You shut me out
The sweet relief of saying, you shield your heart from breaking
Get up, get out now
Get up, get out
Why can't you feel this?
Can't you understand I feel this?
We'll walk around
Eyes on the crowd
Don't you think about tomorrow
You shut me out
I just don't want to fake it anymore
I'm burning out
Your motions empty and you've hit the floor
You shut me out
The sweet relief of saying, you shield your heart from breaking
Get up, get out now
Get up, get out
You watched me follow fools to the sea
Tie the stones that bring me down below the tide
Down and down....
What am I supposed to do?
You shut me out
I just can't live like this anymore
I'm burning out
It doesn't feel like it once did before
You shut me out
The sweet relief of saying, you shield your heart from breaking
Get up, get out now
