Ooh, that boy just kills me
One look and he just chills me
The Romeo of romance
Makes Juliet jump out of her (Woo)
All the girls say he's so fine
They envy me 'cause he's all mine
He often calls me up to say:
("Hey, baby, you just made my day")

I can't stand it
Oh, he's so fierce
Don't stop it, baby
I can't stand it
No, don't you stop it, baby
Give it all to me
Please, don't ever stop
Keep it comin', baby

He sends me in a frenzy
Gives me good and plenty
Never questions this or that
(Well, I guess) I just got it like that
He worships, he adores me
He just downright spoils me
Ooh, I just can't get enough
(Tell it, tell it! Why? )
So you can get my stuff?
You might also like
I can't stand it
Ooh, he's so fierce
Don't stop it, baby
I can't stand it
No, don't you stop it, baby
Give it all to me
I can't stand it
Oh, he's so fierce
Don't stop it, baby
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
No, don't you stop it, baby
Give it all to me, oh baby
Please, don't ever stop
Keep it comin', baby

Don't stop it, baby
Give it all to me
Don't stop it, baby
Give it all to me
(I can't stand it)
Don't stop it, baby
Give it all to me
(I can't stand it)
Don't stop it, baby
Give it all to me
(I can't stand it)
Don't stop it, baby
Give it all to me
(I can't stand it)
Don't stop it, baby
Give it all to me
(I can't stand it)
Keep it, keep it comin', baby
Give it all to me
(I can't stand it)
Oh, it's so good, baby
