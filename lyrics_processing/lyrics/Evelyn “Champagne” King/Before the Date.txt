There's a first time for everything
But this is really not my style
It's just a blind date
It's not like I'm walking down the aisle, oh

Will he be a gentleman? (Knocking at your door)
Or will he be the devil in disguise?
Who will be the one (Coming back for more?)
Oh, why do I hurry up to wait?

There's a way to know before the date
So let the chemistry flow, I won't hesitate

Anticipation's got me hooked from head to toe
Will his body language tell me what I want to know? Ooh
I like an intellectual that holds a Master's in Woman
Got to be bright, polite, but not too right
If you know what I mean now

I want a man who'll make me (Forget about rules)
A man who makes me feel like I'm the one
This time, I won't be the one to start (Playing the fool)
I won't be leaving it up to fate
You might also like
I'm steady on the case before the date, mmm-hmm
Before I'm there, he'll have to break

Do you wanna have fun
Bef-bef-before the date?
Bef-bef-bef-before the date
Bef-bef-bef-bef-, date
Bef-bef-bef-before the date
Bef-bef-before the date
Bef-bef-bef-before the date
Bef-bef-bef-bef-
So let, so let the chemistry flow
So let, so let, so let, so, so, so let the chemistry
Oh, oh, I
Oh, oh, I

Will we go for physical (Extremities)
Or will we focus only on the mind?
To find both in one man is the (Epitome)
Of a woman's desired state

Before the date (The devil in disguise)
Will he be the devil in disguise (Before the date)
Or will you have a smile of an angel? Ooh
Before the date
Mmm-hmm, before the date
I can't help but anticipate (Before the date)
Love will never do right (Do you know what I mean?)
Do ya? (Before the date)
Mmm-hmm, no, no matter (Before the date)
Yeah, yeah
No, no matter (I won't hesitate)
Ooh, ooh
(Before the date)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 'fore the date
(Before the date) Ooh
Yeah, yeah
(Before the date)
Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean?
