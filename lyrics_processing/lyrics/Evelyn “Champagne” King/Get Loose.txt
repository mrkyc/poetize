Get loose
Get loose

I worked hard all day
Now it's time to get away
Gonna find a place to play
And express myself if I may

Gonna take the time
To relax my mind
Gonna take a chance
To release on this world and dance

Get loose
I'm gonna get down with the groove
Get loose
Get funky tonight
Get loose
I'm gonna get down with the groove
Get loose
Get funky, get funky tonight

Life was meant to live
Feelings responsive
Something's got to give
I'm arousingly sensitive

Gonna take the time
To relax my mind
Gonna take the chance
To release on this world and dance

Get loose
I'm gonna get down with the groove
Get loose
Get funky tonight
Get loose
I'm gonna get down with the groove
Get loose
Melt in time

Ooh, ooh, ah, ah
I'm working hard all day
But now it's time to go on out
Party, get away
I gotta get, I gotta
I gotta get funky tonight
Down to the spot where the music's hot
And the pool is out of sight
Well, I've been to work and I've been to school
To get ahead, that's pretty cool
But now it's time to loosen up
Scream like a fool
I wanna party where they dare
Funk down without a care
There's no excuse, I've got plenty of juice
So, come on, baby, let's get loose

Get loose
(I'm gonna get on down tonight)
Get loose, tonight
Get loose
(I'm gonna get on down tonight)
Get loose

Gonna take the time
To relax my mind
Gonna take a chance
To release all my cares and dance

Get loose
I'm gonna get down with the groove
Get loose
Get funky tonight
Get loose
I'm gonna get down with the groove
Get loose
Get funky, get funky tonight
Get loose
(I'm gonna get on down tonight)
I just want to get on down (Tonight)
Get loose
(I'm gonna get on down tonight)
Get loose
I just want to get on down
Get loose
(I'm gonna get on down tonight)
Gonna get on down, get on down
Get loose, tonight
Get loose
I'm gonna get down with the groove
Get loose
Get funky, get funky tonight
Get loose
(I'm gonna get on down tonight)
Get loose
