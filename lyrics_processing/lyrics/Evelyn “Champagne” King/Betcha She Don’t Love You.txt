Betcha she don't love you
Like you know I love you, ooh
And I betcha she would never do
All the things I do for you

Did she buy you those furs
Does she drive a new car
Have it ever occurred to you, baby
She might break your heart

Ooh, it won't be too long
Like the calm that's before the storm
She's gonna break your heart

Betcha she don't love you
Like you know I love you, ooh
And I betcha she would never do
All the things I do for you

Did you tell her 'bout me
Does she know about us
How in the heat of the night, ooh baby
We've been making love
You might also like
Ah, you said my kiss was one of a kind
And that my love was so hard to find
She's gonna break your heart

Betcha she don't love you
Like you know I love you (ooh)
And I betcha she would never do
All the things I do for you

Gonna betcha, gonna betcha
Gonna betcha, gonna betcha she don't love you
Gonna betcha, gonna betcha
Gonna betcha, gonna betcha she don't love you

A bird in the hand
Is worth two in the bush, yeah, yeah
You don't miss your water
Until the well runs dry, yeah, yeah

Ooh, it won't be too long
Like the calm that's before the storm
She's gonna break your heart
Betcha she don't love you
Like you know I love you, ooh
And I betcha she would never do
All the things I do for you
Oh, I betcha she don't love you
Like you know I love you
And I betcha she would never do
All the things I do for you

Gonna betcha, betcha, betcha, baby
Betcha she don't love you, oh baby
Betcha, betcha, betcha, baby
Betcha she don't love you
Ooh baby
Gonna betcha, gonna betcha
Gonna betcha, gonna betcha she don't love you
Gonna betcha, gonna betcha
Gonna betcha, gonna betcha she don't love you
Oh baby, betcha, betcha, betcha, baby
Betcha she don't love you, oh baby
Betcha, betcha, betcha, baby
