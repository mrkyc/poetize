Wonder why, I try to fight the chemistry
I get high, every time your body's next to me
I don't need a book to show me how, ooh ooh
I don't need an English teacher
To help me to say I want you now

I'll give it up, yes, sweet honey, you win
Ooh, I wanna give in to temptation
A fire's burning underneath my skin
That tells me stop the hesitation

Well, I try, to do the things you want me to
Yes, you're right, you want me and I want you too
No one's gonna tell me wrong from right, ooh ooh
Lovin' you is all that matters
Baby, I can't wait another night

I'll give it up, yes, sweet honey, you win
Ooh, I wanna give in to temptation
A fire's burning underneath my skin
That tells me stop the hesitation
Now, give it up, yes, sweet honey, you win
Ooh, I wanna give in to temptation
A fire's burning underneath my skin
That tells me stop the hesitation
