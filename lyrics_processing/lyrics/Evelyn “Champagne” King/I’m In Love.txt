I've been thinkin' 'bout you
The way I feel about you

I had you on my mind
Way we met, it all happened so fast
There was love in your eyes
When we touched there was love, so let's make it last

Sometimes you can't tell if love is real
(If love is real)
There ain't no doubt about the way I feel
(The way I feel, yeah)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
The way I feel about you
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

I woke up late last night
Visions of you, real they seem
Needed you by my side
Now with you in my life, I can live in this dream
You might also like
Sometimes you can't tell if love is real
(If love is real)
There ain't no doubt about the way I feel
(Way I feel)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
The way I feel about you
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love, yeah, hey yeah, yeah)
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, love, love

I've been thinkin' 'bout you
The way I feel about you
I'm in love (I'm in love, oh, love)
I'm in love (I'm in love, love, love, yeah yeah yeah)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you (Oh baby)
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
The way I feel about you (Ooh)
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love, ah)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (Oh baby)
Ooh, and there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
The way I feel about you
(Way I feel about you, there ain't no doubt about it)
