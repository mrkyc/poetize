You're everything I've always wanted and more
That's for sure
I feel like somebody blew the dots off my dice
Feels so nice

To go crazy for someone so special
Tailor made, heaven sent just for me
This time I know it's real
'Cause I asked my heart a question and it replied

Kisses don't lie, kisses don't lie
Oh, no, kisses never lie
Kisses don't lie, kisses don't lie
Ooh-ooh
Kisses don't lie, every time we do it
Kisses don't lie, they get right down to it
If you want to know the answer
Kiss and then decide
'Cause kisses don't lie
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Never lie)

The first time I ever saw you, I felt a buzz
That's just what it was
Then passion got bold and whispered in my ear
Sweet love is here
You might also like
So I gave in to the moment
Let it go, let it flow
'Cause I believe in true love at first sight
Then our lips touched for the very first time that night

Kisses don't lie, kisses don't lie
Oh, no, they never, never lie
Kisses don't lie, kisses don't lie
Oh no, no, no
Kisses don't lie, every time we do it
Kisses don't lie, they get right down to it
If you wanna know the answer
Kiss and then decide
'Cause kisses don't lie
No, no, no, no, no (Never lie)

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
Kisses don't lie
Baby, no, no, no
Kisses never lie, never, never lie, oh-oh
Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't lie, every time we do it, kisses
Ooh, oh, oh, never
Kisses don't lie, kisses don't lie
No, they don't lie
Ooh, oh, oh-oh, they never lie
Kisses don't lie
You get right down to it, ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
They never
The first time, I ever saw your face
Kisses don't lie, kisses don't lie
Kisses don't lie, don't lie, they don't lie, oh oh oh
