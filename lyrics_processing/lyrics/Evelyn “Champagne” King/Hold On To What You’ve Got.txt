I like taking chances
Especially when it comes to love
But L-O-V-E
Is not the the kind of word I speak lightly of
It's so romantic
The reflection of the moon on a Caribbean cruise
But there's another reflection I see against the water:
Another man in your shoes

I know you heard the saying like a hand in glove
Well, he's the reason I believe
Money can't buy me love
And since money is your top priority

I suggest you hold on to what you've got
If I had it I know just who I would spend it on
Hold on to what you've got
'Cause I'll be holding on to love, hoo

You shouldn't have no problem
With women, there are those out there
Who would love to play your game
Just for the fun of it
But I don't care
I'm your secretary on the job
I hope that never ends
We may have to see each other
So if we can't be lovers
We can still be friends
You might also like
Business, people, pleasure
Should be on your mind, boy
When it comes to loving me
You're wasting your time
Better give your love to who's loving you
So they can be hugging you

Hold on to what you've got
Now I know I've got somebody who is good this time
You better hold on to what you've got
'cause I'll be holding on to love
Better hold on

I really love my work
But you're getting bold
And that's something you fail to realize
But if you keep it up
I'll have to take control
'Cause you can't put a swift love here on hold
No no no, it just won't go
No no no
You're wasting your time
Business, people, pleasure
Should be on your mind, boy
When it comes to loving me
You're wasting your time
Better give your love to who's loving you
So they can be hugging you

Hold on to what you've got
Now I know I've got somebody who is good this time
You better hold on to what you've got
'Cause I'll be holding on to love
Hold on to what you've got
Now I know I've got somebody who is good this time
You better hold on to what you've got
'Cause I'll be holding on to love, hoo


Hold on to what you've got
Now I know I've got somebody who is good this time
You better hold on to what you've got
'Cause I'll be holding on to love
Hold on to what you've got
Now I know I've got somebody who is good this time
You better hold on to what you've got
