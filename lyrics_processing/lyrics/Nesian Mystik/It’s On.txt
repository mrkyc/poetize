Mr. Sound seletor
Hook me up with a melody
Mr. Sound seletor Oh yeah
Hit me with the beat c'mon
*Verse 1*
(Feleti)
Leave your vocal points at the door
No submerged rhymed tactics
Keep your soul
Whilst shattering verbal lyrical fractures
All content seen in context, it just reflects
When the beat pulses the systems
Who knows what comes next?
Architect of the Arch musical Dynasty
Once again another set from the S.A.B.R.E
Headphone set alight from the heat we supply
Voltage on high elements elevate to the sky
Derive the means live slim
But never shady on premier
Cultivating, Navigating, air raiding through sound layers
Debutant when first dropping beats elevating vinyl cuts
You didn't see it coming till the force pressure motion to bust
Raw facts, true essence don't echo through all raps
We need to counteract bringing them soul claps
Ignite roots connection, Express new projections
Innovative, creative styles in which we blessed with
You might also like*Chorus*
(Te Awanui)
It's on, it's on tonight
(We came to get up all night)
On and on tonight 2x
*Verse 2*
(Junior)
Audio speaking through your speakers
The system's out of commission
Pay attention concentration this art of verbal expression
Under pressure the compression of disruption to the nation
Causing radio eruption verbal destruction
Music construction this verbal transmissions our way of life
Verbally expressin our expressions through music we're causing hype
M.C, Old, Awa,D, Sabre, Health, J.P
Bringing you recipes hot flavours with the beats now
You can't forget about the melodies, harmonies
Flowing systematically (yo this is how we do it)
Possibly this domination will effect
(ooh yeah)
With unpredictable MC's unite collaborate
(Now Baby)
"Stereodic" ability disables this negativity
Dropping new components as we be rocking through this industry
Sufficient dynamics displayin real satisfactory
Systematically alive pushing through the boundaries
(Te Awanui)
Now all we want to do is feel the vibe to take us higher
(Donald)
Yo here comes another one unlike them other ones
Melodic and hypnotic psychotic and patriotic
(Te Awanui)
Girl let your body flow let your body flow
Now fire it up, now fire it up
*Verse 3*
(Donald)
Automatic system and vinyl cipher kinetics
Microphone intimidation impenetrable phonetics
Lyrical mentality a syndication of style
Prepare to battle on the mic
Generation NESIAN CHILD
So whats your cipher pick up the vibe and turn the lights on
Semantic imagery of audio system we ride on
Let bygones be bygones you know you can rely on
The beat to carry the melody prolifically all night long
(Te Awanui)
It's on to the break of dawn
Nesian Style party all night long its on
(Donald)
View sound through all types of audio spectrums
Contenders reigns are short lived once we rock their sections
I come complex with flows like Sabre, Trax and N.A.T did
Orbit the mic Beastie Boys Intergalactic
