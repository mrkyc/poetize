Lively eyes I see. Breezing through to shoot the breeze. / Spirits lifted high but wisely easing, pleasing to appease. / Don't push or pressure that's a good depressor, simply chill. / Alluring vibes conveyed through eyes, seductively. See I appeal / to that quiet deeper nature hiding in them inner regions. / Let's be sinners feel the music of our auras, synesthesia. / Focus on present, don't think if future she loving me. / Had a long day and my energy her recovery. / Smile is gleaming, radiantly beaming, light she emanate. / Caress connecting, radiating, rays spread and illuminate. / As she pass her fingers over pressure points of contact. / Touch her Earth soil, vision tilling through her long tract. / Fertilize, sowing, sowing, covered with the sand of time. / Heard of guys, so-and-so, and told them others stand in line. / Pantomime message through our touch, caressing. Lunar clutch / gravitating to reflection brought when things stressing you aren't much. / Guess when in my presence you can transcend any mental drains. / Youthful fountain, drink from my oasis, I'm your temple rain. / Let's put it simple, plain. I make you feel young again. / Before the venom of commitment came and stung your brain. / Now you feeling trapped, I liberate you like a prison break. / Phoenix deep inside was always there, it just had risen late. / Beyond visual, bask in the glows from our souls. / I take you back in time before your heart had turned cold
