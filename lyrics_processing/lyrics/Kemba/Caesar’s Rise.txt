Does this shit make you intimidated?

Please don't call me conscious
Don't call it political
Please don't deem this lyrical
These are negro spirituals
That's the generation raising guns against they General
Raisin in the sun, I'll raise my son to be less cynical
Raised on a steady diet of Chef Boyardee
Beef-a-roni cup, a slice of bread, and Hi-C
I took the shackles off my feet like Mary Mary
Now I'm more marionettist
Pulling strings, you're merely Miri Ben-Ari nigga
Please, nigga
Woah
I know you want to flaunt
I want to flaunt too
But it ain't been that long
Since there was niggas in the Bronx Zoo
So I'ma pour some out for Ota Benga
Jury said I been resistant
Mama said say no to strangers and I listened, uh
Picture God grabbing Adam by the Adam's Apple
Just as Adam's having at the apple
Now those atoms got you grabbing at your fuckin' Apple tablet
Packing up, cause there's a black man in all black tats and

Aquemini and some Idlewild in my tidal
I see you Ruben Studdards been idle while I been idle
I notice when I walked in you niggas got quiet
I gave you three days grace, now I'm about to start a riot
Hold up
I was raised off a three-piece, only dark meat
Strangers call us niggas and darky
Like that's gon' hurt us and shit
Like I ain't say worse to my brothers during the dozens
And those same brothers
Ain't out here getting murdered and shit
Fuck
I'm not naive, I see your micro-aggression
You may think you're hard to read
You're really hyper-expressive
You may think we'll let you slide 'cause you described as satire
But even with that slack, nah your shit is not that impressive
We're like the Haley Joel Osments of the undertones
Reading through your flag, and your skull and bones
Now the chickens coming home
Roosting on the roof of fucking Fox and CNN
Send reporters to the war so you can watch and see us win
Hoe
 w/ Nina Simone's To Be Young, Gifted and Black
Does this shit make you intimidated?
Does this shit make you intimidated?

When I looked at you
Yes, I knew that you can shoot me down
A sudden move will have me six feet in the ground
Please don't be surprised
If I don't compromise
With a knife stuck in my back, yes this is Caesar's rise


Shoutout to them niggas I don't fuck with
I hope you see me glowing
Grown men doing fuck shit and hopefully you know it
Mama sorry if you're listening, I don't cause no conflict
My conscience is calmness is cognitive dissonance
I been told it's a slippery slope, well I'm Cool Runnings
My niggas pulling strings like B.B. King when the blues coming
Viewers ride the fence, tryna prove something
Choose something
You ain't even eating, nigga chew something
Do something
Shawty called and told me I done changed since I been in it
Like, since I been kinda winning, I been condescending
I been spending Earth, Wind and Fire
Earth, Wind, and Firebending
I been screaming "nigga" at niggas so much that I'm offended
Albeit, I'm being heartless
Done fought so many demons, I'm exhausted
Had the city on my back, now there's a target
Your battle is uphill, you're doing crossfit
'Cause you're shit
Your feeble chatter is fecal matter, you only talk shit
Donald Trump: I have a great relationship with the blacks, I've always had a great relationship with the blacks
Karen Hunter: Uh, no actually, as one of "the blacks" I can tell you, clearly Chris he does not have a great relationship with "the blacks"

Who knew our walls could grow from malt liquor
You coward out when there was more than meets the eye my nigga
Who knew an animal could fall in love
