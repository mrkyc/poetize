This feelin' is runnin' through my soul
I think I've learned what love is
But I'm afraid I let it go
Maybe it's too late
Maybe you've already changed your mind
Turned lovin' into leavin'
And I'm on the outside
You can't take these words
To bed with you
And hold onto them at night
They can't erase the emptiness
And make everything all right
But your laughter and your tenderness
Will never disappear
No matter where you are tonight
A part of you is here with me
Here with me
I don't know where you are
All I know is I need you to be
Here with me
I know it's not too late
To turn around and get it straight
It's my fate to have you here with me

Your love will never die
I can feel your golden skin on mine
Beneath the desert sky
So how can it be true
How can you just turn and let me go
Let the story of your life with mine
Forever go untold
I can't take these words to bed with me
And hold onto them at night
They can't erase the emptiness
And make everything all right
'Cause your laughter and your tenderness
Will never disappear
No matter where you are tonight
A part of you is here with me

I don't know where you are
