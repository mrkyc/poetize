It hit me like a shot
Right out of the blue
All heaven broke loose
I was shaken by the power of love
Taken by the power of you
If I don't get to heaven
For the things that I've done
I guess it's all just history now
Too late to be the innocent one
I know that I've been led astray
Love has torn me apart
But each day is a victory now
Since you have given peace to my heart
Oh, I was a little bit crazy then
Wheels kept turnin' around
And I kept losin' ground
When you stopped me from fallin again
All heaven broke loose
It hit me like a shot
Right out of the blue
All heaven broke loose
I was shaken by the power of love
Taken by the power of you

For a love with no costs
Brought me to my senses again
Gave me back more than I eve lost
So, baby, if I lose my way
If temptation goes to my head
It's only a twist in the road
There's no way that I'll be misled
Oh, I was a little bit crazy then
But I've paid the price
Of my fool's paradise
Now I've just got to hold you again
If all heaven broke loose
It hit me like a shot
Right out of the blue
All heaven broke loose
We were shaken by the power of love
Taken by the power
The love that you've given me
Is a love that is true
And each time I feel like running
I come running home to you
Oh, we were a little bit crazy then
If all heaven broke loose
It hit me like a shot
Right out of the blue
All heaven broke loose
