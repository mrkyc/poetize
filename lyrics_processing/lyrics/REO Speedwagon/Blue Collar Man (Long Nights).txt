Give me a job, give me security (Oh)
Give me a chance to survive
I'm just a poor soul in the unemployment line
My God, I'm hardly alive
My mother and father, my wife and my friends
You see them laugh in my face
But I've got the power, and I've got the will
I'm not a charity case
Sing it boys!

Long nights, impossible odds
Keeping my eye to the keyhole
If it takes all that to be just what I am
Well I'm gonna be a blue collar man
Let me hear it!
Take it, Kevin!

Oh, make me an offer that I can't refuse
Make me respectable, man
This is my last time in the unemployment line
I've got a merit and I

I'll take those long nights, (Oh yeah) impossible odds
Keeping my back to the wall
If it takes all that (All that) to be just what I am
Well I'm gonna be a blue collar man

Keeping my mind on a better life
Where happiness is only a heartbeat away
Paradise, can it be all I heard it was
I close my eyes and maybe I'm already there

I'll take those long nights, (Take the long nights) impossible odds (I'm gonna)
Keeping my back to the wall
If it takes all that (If it takes all that) to be just what I am
Well I'm gonna be a blue collar man

(I'm just a workin' man)
Do do do do do do do do
(I work for a livin', baby)
Do do do do do do do do
(With all that I can)
Do do do do do do do do
(Come on, put it together)
Do do do do do do do do
I'll take those long nights, impossible odds
Keeping my back to the wall
All that (That's right) to be just what I am
Well I'm going to be a blue collar
Gotta be a blue collar
Gonna be a blue collar man

Oh yeah!
