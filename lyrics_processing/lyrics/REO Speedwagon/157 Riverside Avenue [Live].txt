Oh yeah
Alright, people, climb aboard
Let's take a ride down Riverside Avenue, 157
Alright, here we go!

We flew into town on Sunday, had to find a place by Monday
Tried Bridgeport and Westport, 'til we found a place that we thought would do
157 Riverside Avenue, yeah

Well, the Saugatuck River's flowin', Mother Nature's colors are showin'
So cold, so rainy, we couldn't help feelin' blue
Not enough time and too many things to do
(So we just sat there and played some)

Well, we met a young girl on Main Street, wanted to pass her by
She was homely, but we were lonely, she said, "Can I make love to you?"
I said, "157 Riverside Avenue"
(And she talked like a guitar, she said)
(Ooh, a fast-talkin' woman)

Well, it's over, Miss Lena, we're leaving. Such a pleasant stay, I must say
So nice, so easy, we hate to say goodbye to you
At 157 Riverside Avenue, yeah

Alright, but let me tell you
Let me tell you 'bout something here
Every once in a while
Within rock and roll bands, you see
There are little lacks of communication
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
No? Well, let me tell you
Let me tell you
You see, Gary, he plays the guitar
Myself, I sing, you see
So sometimes there's a little gap in between there
Let me give you an example
Let me give you an example
Just the other day, you probably remember it well
It was just the other day, you remember that?
Just the other day, I swear to God, people, just the other day
I called Gary up on the telephone, you see
And he picked up the phone, he said
(Lead guitar solo)
Shit
So I tell you, I gotta be truthful, you took me a little bit by surprise
So I had to think a bit, I sat back
I thought about it
And I said
(Scatting by Kevin Cronin)
(Lead guitar response)
Oh, come on, come on, come on, now, people
Talk to me on time
Talk to me with your hands
Said a-one
Said a-two
Said a-one, two
