I need truth to soak me to the bone
I need my friends all around me now
'Cause I'm not doin' real well when I'm alone
See, my best friend, or at least I thought she was
Has found herself a new friend back at home
I'm drifting here on what's left of my heart
And my spirit is floatin' like a stone
Now, my faith is an illusion
My dreams, some passing ship
I'm reaching out for answers, but I'm losing my grip
So tell me, are you gonna go the distance
Step into the cold, hard rain
Are you gonna keep fightin' through and come back again
I'll forgive your trespasses
Ask your mercy for my own
I've gone as far as I can go
Now it's up to you to find your own way home
I need time, but there's no time
My emotions have dipped into the red
And this vision that I just can't wash away
Is tearin' in my head

There's hope for every soul
But I can't wait forever for a miracle
So tell me, are you gonna go the distance
Step into the cold, hard rain
Are you gonna keep fightin' through and come back again
I'll forgive your trespasses
Ask your mercy for my own
I've gone as far as I can go
Now it's up to you to find your own way home
Some days I feel like letting go - I've held on for so long
Do I need to walk away to see how it feels when I'm gone
So tell me, are you gonna go the distance
Step into the cold, hard rain
Are you gonna keep fightin' through and come back again
I'll forgive your trespasses
Ask your mercy for my own
I've gone as far as I can go
