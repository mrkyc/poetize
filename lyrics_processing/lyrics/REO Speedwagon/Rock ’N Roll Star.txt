When the river ran dry
And I can still remember
My mama cry
She said, "Son leave
As fast as you can
But don't waste your life
In this rock 'n' roll band"
I saw the light
And left as fast as I could
I knew deep down
It was gonna do me good
So I threw my Fender
In an old friend's car
I knew I'd come home
A rock n'roll star
So we hit the road
But the road hit back
We thought we'd take the world
With a hit and run attack
Now I'm center stage
But it feels bizarre
Despite new cars and caviar

Created by the press
But they'll eat you up
If you show' em any stress
So I lick my wounds
And I hide my scars
The whole world thinks
I'm a rock n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
That's what they call you
That's not what you are
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
I still wanna be
I still wanna be
I still wanna be
A rock 'n' roll star
So we got a break
In our whirlwind tour
I called home said
I'm comin' home for sure
I'm tired of hurry up
Make the plane, jump in the car
I'm home on a loan
I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
That's what they call you
That's not what you are
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
I still wanna be, I still wanna be
I still wanna be, I still wanna be
I still wanna be, I still wanna be
I still wanna be
A rock 'n' roll star
A rock 'n' roll star
A rock 'n' roll star
No big deal
