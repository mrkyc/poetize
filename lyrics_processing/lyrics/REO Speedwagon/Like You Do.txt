Well, I've seen women who cross their legs
Before they sit down to the table
And I've seen women who look to the sky
Screamin', "Lord, I believe in the Bible"
And I've seen hookers dancin' through Times Square
With their heads held up so high

But I've never seen a woman
Who makes me feel
Ah, like you do

Well, I've seen couples holdin' hands
With that glazy look in their eyes
And I've seen lovers rollin' 'round in bed
Screamin' as if they're gonna die
And I've seen lovers holdin' hands
And then laughin' when their back is turned

But I've never seen a woman
Who makes me feel
Oh, like you do
Mmm, yeah
