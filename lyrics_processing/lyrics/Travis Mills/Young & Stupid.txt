Life just keeps getting better
Come a long way from the holes in my sweater
My girl go hard, a real go-getter
Told me that she love me forever, she better!
And if she leave me for someone clever
Find a new chick, 'cause that shit don't matter
Don't need money when you got good weather
Rolling around the city, no pressure

Ooh, it's too good to be young and stupid, baby
Ooh, it's too good to be young and stupid, baby
Uh, it just keeps getting better
Life just keeps getting better
It just keeps getting better
Life just keeps getting better

Uh, break it down
Come on!

Life just keeps getting better
Cadillac red, everything leather
Got a new girl, she never say never
Anything she up for, yeah, I'm down, down
Love how that booty's so round, round
Need a boomerang to get around, 'round
Guess I gotta buy another round, round
Five, ten, twenty, out

Get funky with it
Ooh, hot damn
Okay, okay
Whatcha sayin'?

Okay, honestly
What can I say, you only live once
Do it big, get in trouble, it was still fun
You're jet, you've never been on a real one
Back and forth to the plug 'til the deal's done
So, I guess I can't complain, huh?
Go from that to own another type of plane, huh?
But the change did changes
Still, we remain a sucker, bring our name up
Pop lie, like its something to do
But stay your ass right there got something for you
I keep one hundred with you, getting true all fair
I run this shit it ain't nothing you can do 'bout that
No matter what you never keep me outta mind
Hella and hella if you 'bouta check I gotta guy
They say never be the failure but I try
And none be the murder but they alibis
Ooh, it's too good to be young and stupid, baby
Ooh, it's too good to be young and stupid, baby

Ooh, it's too good to be young and stupid, baby
Uh, it just keeps getting better
