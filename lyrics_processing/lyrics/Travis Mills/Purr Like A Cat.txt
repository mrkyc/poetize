She had real nice style with wings on her back
Wings on her back
Wing, wings on her back
She has swag like mine and ones in her crack
Ones in her crack
One, ones in her crack
She had a real fine ass so I hit it from the back
Hit it from the back
Hit it, hit it from the back
And when I had the pussy I made her purr like a cat
Purr like a cat
Purr, purr like a cat

I had my first stripper at the age of 16
Had me feeling like the club was the place to be
I swear I couldn't wait 'till she got off the clock
So we could go back to her spot and she'd hop on top
She would dance to rap, but listen to rock;
We'd be fuckin' to Kiss and then I'd switch it to Pac
She would drive me around and pay for my shit
And I never got jealous of the dudes that she hit
You might also likeI got private dancers in the VIP
Champagne, Rumor, co-workers, and me
Took me in through the back so I chill 'till three
And when the club closed, back to her W suite
HA, and I thought she was so right for me
Truth be told spent every night with me
Talkin' on the phone
Never trying to fight with me
I almost thought she would spend her whole life with me

She had real nice style with wings on her back
Wings on her back
Wing, wings on her back
She has swag like mine and ones in her crack
Ones in her crack
One, ones in her crack
She had a real fine ass so I hit it from the back
Hit it from the back
Hit it, hit it from the back
And when I had the pussy I made her purr like a cat
Purr like a cat
Purr, purr like a cat

She was sexy as hell with a real short fuse
Tough love on her hands
And face tattoos
But one day I picked up her Kick, and bad news
Textin' her ex "I love and miss you"
Like Damn I'm trying to get away from this scene
Now fucking bitch is trying to be Kat Von D;
Not to mention
How much she love the attention
From anyone and everyone who show her affection
I wasn't trying to waste my time with that
One of her friends on my lap
Yeah, I'm fine with that
Thought to myself I guess its time that I got her back;
Plus I hear her friend Michelle has a nice pussycat
In the end I had the last fucking laugh
Because she is still the bitch gettin naked for cash
And now I am the kid makin money over tracks
And you can't hate the real
Cause I'm only spillin facts

She had real nice style with wings on her back
Wings on her back
Wing, wings on her back
She has swag like mine and ones in her crack
Ones in her crack
One, ones in her crack
She had a real fine ass so I hit it from the back
Hit it from the back
Hit it, hit it from the back
And when I had the pussy I made her purr like a cat
Purr like a cat
Purr, purr like a cat

I had, I had, I had those ones in my hand
You had, you had, you had this need for a man
I had, I had, I had those bills in my hand
You had, you had, you had this need for a man
I got my girl on the hush and
Love on the low down
You were so untamable
I just had to figure you out
I'm glad you let me figure you out
You were different from the rest of them
Better than the best of them
You were so untamable
I'm glad you let me figure you out
I just had to figure you out

She had real nice style with wings on her back
Wings on her back
Wing, wings on her back
She has swag like mine and ones in her crack
Ones in her crack
One, ones in her crack
She had a real fine ass so I hit it from the back
Hit it from the back
Hit it, hit it from the back
And when I had the pussy I made her purr like a cat
Purr like a cat
Purr, purr like a cat

She had real nice style with wings on her back
Wings on her back
Wing, wings on her back
She has swag like mine and ones in her crack
Ones in her crack
One, ones in her crack
She had a real fine ass so I hit it from the back
Hit it from the back
Hit it, hit it from the back
And when I had the pussy I made her purr like a cat
Purr like a cat
