I ain't tryna diss I just miss you
You wanna be a star huh
Tell me what's the issue or the interview
I'd probably read it
Write tweet then I delete it
Or song on how youre wrong but it won't ever get completed
I'll hear it, you go and get your club on
Just because the stars come doesn't mean you are one
I'm attracted to my old news
What happened to the old you
Remember when I told you

You think you're so Hollywood *Hollywood*, Diamonds and fancy cars *Movie Star*
Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood *Hollywood*, But they don't really know who you are *they don't, they don't*
No, not like I do
Hollywood *Hollywood*, you wanna be a big star *Big Star*
Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood *Hollywood* But I'm the only one who knows you really are *I Know, I Know, I know*
You think you're so Hollywood, *Hollywood* I know who you are *I know who you are*
You think you're so Hollywood, *Hollywood* I know who you are *I know who you are*

You oh so jaded
And I bet when you're fucking him you have to fake it
You can watch me make it
Regret all the mistakes it
Took for you to realize you're chasing famous
I see it, You going with your love gone
Just because the stars come doesn't mean you are one
I'm attracted to my old news
What happened to the old you
Remember what I told you

You think you're so Hollywood *Hollywood*, Diamonds and fancy cars *Movie Star*
Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood *Hollywood*, But they don't really know who you are *they don't, they don't*
No, not like I do
Hollywood *Hollywood*, you wanna be a big star *Big Star*
Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood *Hollywood* But I'm the only one who knows you really are *I Know, I Know, I know*
You think you're so Hollywood, *Hollywood* I know who you are *I know who you are*
You think you're so Hollywood, *Hollywood* I know who you are *I know who you are*
