Smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors
Smoke and mirrors
Even stars burn out
It's funny how they hate, but I'm all they talk about
Doubts were a constant thing
I was in constant need of weed, constantly
Now my concert fee, has me never looking back again
All these people try to put me down
Tellin me "you ain't gonna make, you ain't gonna make it"
But I'm not breakin
All these people try to fool me now
Askin me "When we gonna kick it? Why'd I get different?"
But I'm not slowin down
Switch on, once I get my rich on
I take a picture of my dick for them to put they lips on
I ain't no fast one
Last long
Get up off my fashion
How you talking shit for stalking pics of what I have on
Damn, change the subject
Cause lately I'm like fuck it
But it's funny how my haters ain't gonna say no shit in public
I got my youngins
And if you didn't hear it, it's motherfucking I'm gettin
And anybody near it
That's the spirit
Get too close and I will lose you
Your mind is a powerful thing, do what you chose to
Just to make shit a little clearer, I know some fake motherfuckers
It's no smoke and mirrors

But I'm not breakin
All these people try to fool me now
Askin me "When we gonna kick it? Why'd I get different?"
But I'm not slowin down
People come, and people go
I'd like to think that I did this all, on my own
People come, and people go
Oh, people go
All these people try to put me down
Tellin me "you ain't gonna make, you ain't gonna make it"
But I'm not breakin
All these people try to fool me now
Askin me "When we gonna kick it? Why'd I get different?"
But I'm not slowin down
