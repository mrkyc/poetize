I always loved it when you would wear your favorite sweater
Curl up beside me, girl, enjoy this world we built together
You got these inhibitions, I had this tunnel vision
You focused on us, I was focused on myself, forgive me

This could be the coldest winter
That we've ever had here (Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This could be the coldest winter
Is this how you wanna start the new year?

Green eyes, red lips
Total package, I unwrap the gift
She only 5'5", but she like 'em tall
Heels on, take 'em off
Probably be the coldest winter
Hope I'm not alone this winter
I just wanna be home this winter
But it just ain't a house without us in it
Truth is your name was the only thing listed
On my wish list; do you miss this?
I know I broke your heart but I can fix it
We put it in work, I ain't talkin' 'bout no business
You trust me, I'ma go the distance
And I would run right back this instant
I made this for you, hope you're listening
Merry Christmas

Act naughty, get coal
Every room got a mistletoe
I give religion to these women
You wish you could have kids with
This Christmas, drinkin' Swiss Miss
With my mistress in the kitchen
In the valley now, I'm just living
Smoke in Cali', Cal', just lift it
Got the coldest winter on my wrist
Got a dollar and a dream and one wish
Tell me how we ended up with all this
Man, I really can't complain about shit
Xmas morning, she say my name
Striped lingerie like a candy cane
Before I wrap it up like a ankle sprain
Merry fucking Christmas from the Bear Cave in LA
This could be the coldest winter
That we've ever had here (Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This could be the coldest winter
