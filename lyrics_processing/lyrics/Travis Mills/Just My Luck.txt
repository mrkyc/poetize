Drunk, smokin' top flight
We was twistin' up the papers too
I rarely drink nowadays, but tonight's for you
Took her home, say she love my cologne
So she asked for my shirt, she put it on
Then I take it off
Skin's baby soft
Let me fuck you rough
Trust me girl, skinny dudes throw the dick tough
I'm crafty, walk inside the club like it's Miami
I'm at it, I had to know if we are common habits
I'm swift with my actions, and honest with attraction
Call 'em how I see 'em and I want you on my mattress
Match this, got a whole jar full, smokin' purp
Damn, your funny personality's what makes it work
And you can spend your whole life tryna find the one
Or you can come spend the night and we can have some fun
Slow down, it's just my luck again
She wanna light up in bed, yeah
She wanna light up in bed, yeah
I gotta bring it, I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it in bed, yeah
She wanna light up in bed, yeah
You might also likeI've got some medical that we can blow
You can be my nurse, my house is the hospital
Lock the door, rub me down
If we were high it'd feel better than it does right now
Better than it does right now, (Million)
You say I always break her off proper
Sex and smokin', gettin' higher than some helicopters
Keep it low-key, like a secret shopper
I got the best trees, kiss me bitch, love doctor
So exquisite, light that cigarette
You're sweet too, let me taste your licorice
Take a break for a minute, we ain't finished yet
Go until we pass out, let's see how fucking high we get
Slow down, it's just my luck again
She wanna light up in bed, yeah
She wanna light up in bed, yeah
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it
I gotta bring it in bed, yeah
She wanna light up in bed, yeah
