Pushing every limit, would you pray for me?
Living like our time is almost up
It's late, so now I'm thinking you should stay with me
Looking at you, you look like the one, one
Look like the one for me, one for me
The one, one
Look like the one for me, the one for me
The one, one
Look like the one for me, the one for me
The one, one
You look like the one for me, the one for me

Yeah, I'm in the back (Back)
You in the front (Front)
Gripping your thighs (Woo)
Gripping a blunt
Money keep pouring out (Pour it out)
I want you badly
I call you Mama (Mama)
You call me Daddy

I think you the one for me, you get it done for me, yeah
And all of my habits just stopped being fun for me, yeah
Can't leave you alone, and plus you love the company (Woah), yeah
I ain't gonna say it again, baby, come with me (Come with me)
