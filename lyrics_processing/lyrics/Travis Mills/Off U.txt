Nothing more than I hate than some shit that's not true
Probably went and tell your friends that I'm sad I lost you
I used be on
But now I'm off you
I used be on
But now I'm off you

Every time I'm off the drink
I ain't thinkin' bout you
Yeah, I got a new bitch I'm just glad it's not you
I used to be on
But now I'm off you
I used to be on
But now I'm off you

Baby, tell me everything that you think about late night
When you laying down and the feeling ain't right
And you know you ain't mine
And you change time
And you can't save face
I ain't in the same place, nah
I don't miss the old you, I don't even know you
Try to come back now, I already told you
Put me through some shit, there's some more you're gonna go through
Now you're old news (x3)
Now I'm off you
My new bitch is fucking awesome
Fuck her in the car often
Driving around the 101 and I'm smoking weed coughing
Hoping I don't get pulled over by the law then
We could get it poppin'
Yeah I get it poppin'
I just spent like twenty thousand shoppin'
And the lights are blinding
Man I think I gotta stop them
Fuck them old hoes cause they know we off them

Baby, I thought that you'd have my babies by now
I heard you drive a mercedes now
It's crazy how it all worked out, it's crazy how it all went down
Oh you thought that I'd be hurting, no
Yeah you go, always putting on a show
Don't let that fine ass hit the door
Think that I still care but I don't
I've been fucked up and I've been thinking about everything that I'd be doing
Going out every weekend and all the girls I'm texting
And how I make a mess of everything with all of my exes
I don't make excuses girl, I just go and get it
If you ever disrespect me baby, you gonna regret it
Oh I'm off u now but you just can't forget it
You never got your happy ending
