And some Indica Indica blowing in the air
No I don't need much cause I drank too much
I just want the girl over there in a bed we can share
And some Indica Indica blowing in the air
No I don't need much cause I smoke too much
Come around and you know what my name is
Got a bag full of gas and we can blaze it
Got my whip for a steal call it stainless
Wanna paint it?
And you know all my girls drinking mai thai's
Why do all of you girls look sci-fi
Got a big-ass crib with the wifi
Your ex asked for the password last night
I don't really care about her best friend..nah
I don't really care about her ex-man...nah
I ain't even tryna be her next man...nah
I am just looking for some love in the club
With the girl over there in a bed we can share
And some Indica Indica blowing in the air
No I don't need much cause I drank too much

No I don't need much cause I smoke too much
I just need a little bit of this and a little bit of that
Give it to me, ima give it right back
Saint Laurents with a backwards hat
What the fuck are y'all looking at
Do it my way, 100 on the highway
I don't care what any of y'all say
Quit it with the he said, she said
It's about to be, one hell of a weekend
Don't really care about her best friend
I don't really care about her ex-man...ah
I ain't even tryna be her next man...ah..
