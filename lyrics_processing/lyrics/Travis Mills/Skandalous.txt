I got a girl but she ain't home, you want it huh?
Just come on over, you ain't gotta go, she ain't gotta know
You want it huh, me too now come on over
The light's down, the radio's on playing my song let me sing it for you
The tape's, in the camera's on, we gone be here till the morn I got a thing for you
It ain't wrong if I make it feel right
I'mma have you my way, you can fill my appetite
You make me say

You so scandalous you so you so scandalous
You so scandalous but damn that pussy glamorous

I dish it out you eat it up no loving we just fucking yeah beat it up
With me around it's a wrap I get that blood pumping call me Mr. Cardiac
The doors locked, the blinds are shut
Let me ask you what, I got a question for you
Let's go again I'm talkin round two we gone be here till the morn I got a thing for you
It ain't wrong if you make it feel right
I'mma have you my way, you can fill my appetite
You make me say

Light a candle it's a scandal

Sheets wetter than a fucking water bed breaking

I got my girl we are just (?) but you a center fold
Thank you for the ride come on baby do it to me one more time
I'm running through it like a stop sign

You so scandalous you so you so scandalous
