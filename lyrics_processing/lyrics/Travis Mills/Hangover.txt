Poison poundin' through my head
Swear I gotta stop then find myself at it again
If I didn't have you I'd be locked away or dead
I know
For sho'
Love it when it hurts, when it's good, when it burns
And it hits my chest
Now my vision's blurred, and I'm slurrin' out my words
But there's no regret
All I need is you and your moves in the nude, baby
Lose that dress
Now I'm hungover Baby come over
The reason
The reason I get fucked up every night
Is so you can heal my body In the morning, in the morning
The reason
The reason I get fucked up every night
Is so you can heal my body In the morning, in the morning
I been lit all night, put me on
Know my mouth is dry, quench me now
Baby, your body runs, through my mind
I got a loaded gun, save my life
Love it when it hurts, when it good, when it burns, and
It hits my chest
Now my vision's blurred, and I'm slurrin' out my
Words, but there's no regret
All I need is you and your moves in the nudes, baby
Lose that dress
Now I'm hungover
Baby come over
The reason
The reason I get fucked up every night is so
You can heal my body In the morning, in the morning
The reason
The reason I get fucked up every night is so
You can heal my body In the morning, in the morning
Baby the reason I get fucked up so you can heal me
Baby the reason I get fucked up (up...)
(Baby the reason)
The reason
The reason I get fucked up every night
Is so you can heal my body In the morning, in the morning
The reason
The reason I get fucked up every night
Is so you can heal my body In the morning, in the morning
The reason
The reason I get fucked up every night
Is so you can heal my body In the morning, in the morning
The reason
The reason I get fucked up every night
