I don't even know what i'm gonna say
Sippin' gin and o'j she got the fancy
Champagne, i don't even know where we
Gonna go we i can take her to my home
Or we can get a ho-tell'n her a lie
I can't stay the night cause i gotta
Be up early in the mornin' for a flight
But it's alright cause she love my swag
I let her hold my kush in a thousand dollar bag
She going to be a lawyer so she know my case
She got her hands up on the wall got my hands
Up on her waist, hater wanna know how i get so lucky
Never joined a frat and all these collage girls love me
One one
(Chorus)
Sometimes i feel like i been getting smarter, and i wake up
Damn i'm right back where i started, go it's gonna be a late night oh
I'm just trynna get her name right, oh and they told me
That my games tight but sometimes it's like
I don't even know
Here's what i do know my shirt says polo
Boxers and socks all got the same logo
Got one white, chick got one coco
Both ride the stick up and down like a pogo
Fans call the popo wanna see up burnin' down
Payin' no mile with money that im earnin' now
Learnin' 'bout all the stoke star pippin'
You ain't gotta like me but your girlfriend listen
Damn, i'm on a mission to the moon, and on the way
I fuck a star or two ha i know i'll get there soon
But i'm lookin' at my self like "who are you?"
You might also like(Chorus)
I don't even know what her name is, i don't even know
What today is
I can't really call it call it
I can't really call it call it
I don't even know what my name is
I don't even know what to day is
I can't really call it call it
I can't really call it call it
