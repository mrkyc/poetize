I'm ten steps ahead of you
But I
But I couldn't be closer to the truth
So you can stop talking that
Talking that shit
Because you already used that excuse
And I don't have the time to waste on you
Your clock's so wrong but I'll fix it soon
You thought you were the one I'd always choose
Today's the day you learn how to lose

I've been down
Again and again
But now it's your turn, whoa
What I found was only the end
But now it's your turn to go
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn to go
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn to go
You might also like
I wonder if you ever know
How I
How I saw you through the tinted glass
I'm sick and tired to be sick and tired
That's why
I have to get the fuck out fast
I never have the heart to waste on you
You think you're breaking mine
But it isn't true
I wasn't quite sure how to break the news
Today's the day you learn how to lose

I've been down
Again and again
But now it's your turn, whoa
What I found was only the end
But now it's your turn to go
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn to go
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn to go
I'm ten steps ahead of you
I'm ten steps ahead of you
You think you breaking mine
But it isn't true
I wasn't quite sure how to break the news
Today's the day you learn how to lose

I've been down
Again and again
But now it's your turn, whoa
What I found was only the end
But now it's your turn to go
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn to go
Now it's your turn
Now it's your turn
