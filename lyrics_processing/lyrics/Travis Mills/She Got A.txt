I fucked this white girl
Who got a pink range
And she drives fast in the slow lane
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new

She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new
I fucked this white girl
Who got a pink range
And she drives fast in the slow lane
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new

I smoke like a motha fucking chimney
Laughing with my eyes closed
Yellin' Bruh cig me
But thats neither here nor there
Cause when I talk ya hear thoughts so rare
I'm finna be on clap your hands say "Yeah"
The weight of my mistake
I need an ounce in a bag
Super high me flow
On the champagne campaign
Elect me I popped every bottle ever made
Expect me I ducked every model when they came
They be hittin' my line and I just let it ring
Split a swisher
With your sister kush kissed her
Consider her so pretty
Yo with this shit I whispered
Recite some old lyrics
Make a bitch fall in love
Then Im on to the next cause one is not enough
One is not enough
Nah, one is not enough
But if she brings a friend I know is finna get rough
I fucked this white girl
Who got a pink range
And she drives fast in the slow lane
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new
She got a neck tattoo and all her clothes are new
But do I love her?
No
Im unstoppable
I can't see you
You're unwatchable
Like a motha fuckin broken t.v
If you could turn it on you'd probably see me
Take notes when I speak
Shit is cruical
I am highly educated
Im 'bout to school ya

You wanna ride the dick
Better get a new idea

Like a hipster at ikea
I got my middle finger up
Ask me how I feel
I just couldn't give a fuck
