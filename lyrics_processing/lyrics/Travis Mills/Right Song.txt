It's Friday night she turns up
She calls me, but I'm drunk as fuck
So I send a cab, she'll be here soon
She's sneaking out of her dorm room
She love the way her heart beat, when I make her laugh
And every time the radio's on

I hit you with that right song, that right song
And you're mine, don't be shy
You got my playlist on your iPod, your iPod
For tonight, every time
I hit you with that right song, that right song
You and I, you and I
Play it all night long, all night long
Cause you're mine, yeah you're mine
Girl I'll play that right song
Text me when she's driving
She said she heard my record, playing on the radio
She sent me a picture now
You know I can't resist it
My hands around your hips
It's ridiculous
I'm ballin' it
You callin' into work late
The first day(first day) you let me get to first base
Second night was a little more
Third time you know I have the score
You cut me girl, you're first aid
I'll think you're fine, I'm sure of it
God damn your body perfect, take care of it
Make you switch your ringtone
Make me sing a new hook about loving you and making love
You kill me with that one look
Hit record and let it play
Hear me sing my heart out
You started it, I'll finish it
We on top of the charts now
You might also like
I hit you with that right song, that right song
And you're mine, don't be shy
You got my playlist on your iPod, your iPod
For tonight, every time
I hit you with that right song, that right song
You and I, you and I
Play it all night long, all night long
Cause you're mine, yeah you're mine
Girl I'll play that right song

I can't hear a thing
Except you right here with me
I beat that body while I sing
I'm hitting high notes in that thing
I'm hitting high notes in that thing
Now baby speed it up
Slow it down
Chop and screw me(chop and screw me)
Get on top. Grind it out
Chop and screw me(chop and screw me)
I'm a favourite on your playlist
Play me, now play this
Naked and Famous
Fuck that they ain't shit
It's Friday night she turns up
She calls me, but I'm drunk as fuck
So I send a cab, she'll be here soon
She's sneaking out of her dorm room
She love the way her heart beat, when I make her laugh
And every time the radio's on

I hit you with that right song, that right song
And you're mine, don't be shy
You got my playlist on your iPod, your iPod
For tonight, every time
I hit you with that right song, that right song
You and I, you and I
Play it all night long, all night long
Cause you're mine, yeah you're mine
