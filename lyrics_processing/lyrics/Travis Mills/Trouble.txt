I'm always looking for trouble
And I ain't got no trouble finding it
My new girl, she act like the devil
Cause that's all I'm ever her side of it, yeah
I'm always looking for trouble
And I ain't go not trouble finding it
I'm 'bout to pour me a double
Guess it's just one of them nights again, yeah
'Cause I'm always, I'm always, I'm always looking for trouble, yeah
I'm always, I'm always, I'm always looking for trouble, yeah
And I ain't got no trouble finding it
'Cause I'm always looking for trouble
I'm always looking for trouble, yeah
Sometimes I fee like the trouble go looking for me
But where else you go when it's quarter to three
And she all on your phone and she down on your knees
Please
Don't act like you'd do any different
Don't act like your bitch isn't missing this
Don't act like you getting these dividends
I be on top and you ain't, that's the difference
That call that perspective
Lost a few friends, but I do not regret it
Wrote a few hits that I play at my set list
Ask your girl 'bout it, her name on the guest list
Damn
I couldn't resist it, girl, that ass look just like a bubble
Yeah

Yeah
I'm always looking for trouble

And I ain't go not trouble finding it
I'm 'bout to pour me a double
Guess it's just one of them nights again
Yeah

I'm always looking for something new
Might get a room at the W
All of my bitches, they fuck with me
All of my bitches ain't fuck with you
Uber XL to the club just to buy a few bottles
And fuck me a model
Then fly out to Cabo
Just for the tacos
Like I won the lotto
This shit is a problem, man
And I ain't even try'na fix it
I like 'em 5'6, slim thick, independent
Whip so fast, I got a quick wrist
She mix some vodka with the citrus
Good kush and cologne, come and sniff this
Girl Scout Cookies, no thin mints
Shawty always getting into trouble
Guess that means that we got the same interests
I'm always looking for trouble
And I ain't got no trouble finding it
My new girl, she act like the devil
Cause that's all I'm ever her side of it, yeah
I'm always looking for trouble
