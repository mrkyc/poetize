I really wanna be with you baby
But I gotta do me first
I know you like it when were lovin'
And I know that it hurts
When it's all said and done
At the end of the day
I've already had my fun
So there's nothing left to say

I tried to keep this goin' as long as I coulda
Didn't tell you things that I probably shoulda
Things were goin' great from the moment that we hooked up
Now your head is down and I need you to look up
Not cause I hate you
I really wanna date you
You just know, nobody can replace you
Not tryin to break you
I just wanna make you
See the things that I don't do for me
Friends tellin' you to forget me
Now they got you wishin' that you never would of met me
In a few years I'll be back if you let me
And when I'm on the road its okay if you text me
If you can't stand it, feel like I planned this
Girl you're dead wrong
Yeah, you're dead wrong
I wanna be honest, I'm just not on it
Maybe one day, maybe one day
You might also like

It's been a while since we talked last
Isn't it crazy how fast the time pasts
Remember the nights when we would lay awake
And touch on each other till the break of day
It's funny how things change, I hope youre doing great
I found your picture in my wallet from our first date
I hope you moved on, but still remember me
This is what I done at least we got memories
Don't dwell on it. Just smile now
We'll be fine, we'll be fine, somehow
