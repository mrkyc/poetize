But I keep on hurting you (oh baby, baby)
I thought we could see tomorrow
(Yesterday)
Hear me out, hear me out girl
I see you talking about yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
How I won't talk about yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Now she got me talking bout yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
There ain't no going back now (3x)
Damn girl slow it down put a groove on it
If all you see it's my pass we can't move forward
Then it turns into the worst romance
Cause you stepping on my toes like your first slow dance and
I just want you on a bomb scene
I hope you blow like Palm trees in Palm Springs
But instead of going to bed we keep going back
Now my prom queen's in the wrong scene
She tells me loves free, I say it's expensive
You tell me I offend you, I say you defensive
So I'd rather spend a dime, stead of spending time
Every time I do, my stay is extensive
I just give you good sex in place of devotion
So cool I backstroke a deal a lake of emotions
Save that shit, for another fly guy
Trying to dive and come out on the other side dry like
You might also likeI thought I could make it better
But I keep on hurting you (oh baby, baby)
I thought we could see you tomorrow
(Yesterday)
Hear me out, hear me out girl
I see you talking about yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
How I won't talk about yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Now she got me talking bout yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
There ain't no going back now (3x)
Wish you could see it like I see from the aerial town
Every day we go in circles like a merry go around
I wanna marry your smile, baby bury your frown
And put stones all around you like a burial ground
Give you sunshine like I got it in the bag
Don't be fucking it up the future leaving probs in the past
You're my princess
Wanna see you with your tiara on
In the mirror dancing getting Cierra on
I love it, love the way you does it
You be killing all these jealous of all fuckers say you wasn't but
A straight boss, straight boss
I'm suited up like superman with his cape off
She do it up like, Kate spade on Kate moss
She want to take off from work, so we can take off
But it's me, I could never blame you
I'm just sorry that this fairytale never true like
I thought I could make it better
But I keep on hurting you oh baby, baby
I thought we could see tomorrow
(Yesterday)
Hear me out, hear me out girl
I see you talking about yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
How I won't talk about yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Now she got me talking bout yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
There ain't no going back now (3x)
(Autotune)
If I could turn the hands of time
I'd take us back when you were mine
I thought of how
How hard I try to make a (?)
Stop worrying about
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
How I won't talk about yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Now she got me talking yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
