Girls from out the state just come to kick it and they moving here
Stole my favorite shirt, she took it home just like a souvenir
She can't stay tonight, I kick her right out when the Uber's near

Coming through the bands now
They said I was old news
Now I move the asphalt
Look at all this cash now
Coming through the bands now
Coming through the bands now
