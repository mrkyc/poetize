You know what you put me through
That's why I'm scared to get in touch with you
You know what you put me through
I don't know why I'm still in love with you

I got quite a few unread texts
And I don't want to read 'em right now
'Cause nothing really even makes sense
I'm a goddamn mess
And I sleep past noon
I keep telling all my friends that we'll hang out soon
But we never do
You know what you put me through
And after all that I still fuck with you
Arm around your waist like I'm stuck to you
And I know I'm just as crazy to put up with you
But sleeping next to you's more comfortable
You the one, you the one, you the one, you the
I still think about
I got bud, I got roses
Trying to get over this shit you do

'Cause you know what you put me through
That's why I'm scared to get in touch with you
You know what you put me through
I don't know why I'm still in love with you
You might also like
I don't know what to do next
'Cause you don't really feel it right now
There's a million other girls I could get
But you're the only one I can't seem to forget
That's why I'm sitting here and I'm thinking 'bout you
Keep on telling me that we'll hang out soon
But we never do
You know what you put me through
And after all that I still fuck with you
Arm around your waist like I'm stuck to you
And I know I'm just as crazy to put up with you
But sleeping next to you's more comfortable
You the one, you the one, you the one you the
I still think about
I got bud, I got roses
Trying to get over this shit you do

'Cause you know what you put me through
That's why I'm scared to get in touch with you
You know what you put me through
I don't know why I'm still in love with you
You know what you put me through
That's why I'm scared to get in touch with you
