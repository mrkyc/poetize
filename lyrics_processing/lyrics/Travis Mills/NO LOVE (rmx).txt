Car red like your lipstick
I'ma show you how to drive stick shift
With the foot up on the gas, and the foot up on the dash
And my head inside your lap like woo (Goddamn, yeah)
I know how to get you heated up (Heated up)
You say you always needed more
That's why you're here right now
Got some problems with your man
You gon' leave him at the door, but
I told you right before we do this
I move with the silence, I don't like intruders
I don't trust bitches, they all act like Judas
I don't need love, 'cause I know what the truth is
You see somethin' in me, I see somethin' in you
Apparently up here and shapes our opinion
I'd say we aren't shallow, but who are we kiddin'?
Heh, who are we kiddin'?

I don't need no love darling
I'm just trying to get some company
I suggest you come with me
I know you're lonely girl, so hold me girl
One night and one night only, girl, let's go (We're alone)
You might also like
I smoke like I don't know it's killin' me (Killin' me)
I grew up with my dogs on pedigree (On pedigree)
And now we live up in a house that I bought by myself (Ooh)
And I got it all off of these melodies
Come see for yourself when the night's over (Night's over)
Got a Cali' king bed and a leather sofa (Leather sofa)
And a leather jacket on my coat holder
And a full bar with a glass of cold soda
Take the stress off, girl, let it out (Let it out)
My tongue gon' make you forget about (Forget about)
That bitch ass you workin', the bills you got comin'
But you could hit me up if you need a little help (Hit me up)
All up in your feelings 'cause you missin' me
Countin' down the days 'til you kissin' me
You know what I told you, don't you forget it
I love you tonight, and tomorrow I'll regret it

I don't need no love darling
I'm just trying to get some company
I suggest you come with me
I know you're lonely girl, so hold me girl
One night and one night only, girl, let's go (We're alone)
I don't need no love darling
I'm just trying to get some company
I suggest you come with me
I know you're lonely girl, so hold me girl
