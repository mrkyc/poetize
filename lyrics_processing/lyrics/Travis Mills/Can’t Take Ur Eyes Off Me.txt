If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
They say hindsights 20/20
But your eyes are always stunning
It's a tragedy, I'm a casualty
Cause you fell in love with me
*in love with me*

Hurt before some years, you just had to get me
Every time I went out my parents wouldn't let me
Called me 4 times, a couple more times
Your body is off the hook, so is my phone line
I wouldn't act distant if you weren't persistent
On bein crazy bitch thats why I'm acting different
Run and tell all your friends I'm a dickhead
And then tell every girl in the world how good the sex is

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
They say hindsights 20/20
But your eyes are always stunning
It's a tragedy, im a casualty
Cause you fell in love with me
*in love with me*

You got everything you wannna

You can't take your eyes of me 
You got everything you wannna
But you can't have me too,too

Despite your best intentions,they were your worst mistakes
Girl you eat attention in the worst ways
You thristy and no I won't stay another minute
How you'd think I wouldn't end it
You ain't got an once of confidence in you
And I dont have the time to begin to explain
Everything's thats on my brain
Cause it's obvious you ain't gonna change

If looks could kill you'd be a murderer
They say hindsights 20/20
But your eyes are always stunning
It's a tragedy, I'm a casualty
Cause you fell in love with me

But you can't have me too,too
You've gone of the deep end 
You can't take your eyes of me 
You got everything you wanna
But you can't have me too,too
You can't take your eyes of me 
You got everything you wanna
But you can't have me too too too
You can't take your eyes of me 
You got everything you wanna
