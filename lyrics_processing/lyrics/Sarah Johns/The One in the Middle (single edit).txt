Use me
You've fooled around and a'wrecked my heart
She's just a skank rode hard and put up
Well, good luck
I would've given you the finger on my left hand
The one that you use for a wedding band
(But) (And) now I'm givin' you
The one in the middle
The one that's a little bit longer
And I got another one
On my other hand
So I can say it even stronger
If you're askin' if I'm done
Well, I'm sure not sayin' you're number one
(No, now I'm givin' you)
(The one in the middle)
(The one that says we're through)
I hope you're happy with your sad life
That's right
I hope you get what you deserve
And when you're tired of TV dinners
Remember
You might also likeI would've given you the finger on my left hand

(No, now I'm givin' you)
(The one in the middle)
(The one that says we're through)
Well, you made your bed
So go lay in it
And you forced my heart and hands
To the limit
Ah, yeah, I've had it with you, darlin'
That's right
(But) (And) now I'm givin' you
The one in the middle
The one that's a little bit longer
And I got another one
On my other hand
So I can say it even stronger
If you're askin' if I'm done
Well, I'm sure not sayin' you're number one
