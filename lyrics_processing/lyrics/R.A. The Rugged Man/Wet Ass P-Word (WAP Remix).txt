Fuck what I said, it don't mean shit now
Fuck those presents, might as fuck throw them out
Fuck all those kisses, it didn't mean jack
Fuck you you , I don't want you back

Whores in this house
Whores in this house
Whores in this house
My kids are in the other room
(Wet Ass Pussy)
I got- I gotta do this quick
Hol- Hol- Hol- Hold up
Before they come back
This what I'm saying
(S-s-s-s-s-seven days a week)
W-W-W-Wet Ass P-Word
I said

Piss on my bed, piss on my face bitch
Shit on my chest, show me what you ate bitch
Wet sticky sweet lick the cake mix
Take a full fist, let me take pics
Film the flick porn
Get your slit torn
My body count, like Little Bighorn
I killed the pussy like General Custer
Sing slow ballads, fuck her like I love her
Gave her R&B, S.T.D. like Usher
She unclean like a dirty dumpster
I sucked the saline, 'til titties rupture
Get the plastic surgeon to reconstruct her
She juiced up, Canelo versus Krusher
The squirt squirt gargle she a gusher
Fat ass out, it's a full course
Use the pussy juice as the mouth wash
And I floss my teeth with the pubic hairs
As I feed you the food stay glued to your chairs
You offended by Cardi & Megan rhymin'
I'm more offended by Trump and Biden
And fuck the DNC and all their staffers
And fuck Trump, a bunch of racist crackers
The state of America, I'm quite embarrassed
The cop and the racist, Biden/Harris
Bannin' speech won't stop the lesson
Wanna watch some porn, I got a hot collection
The conservatives cry in the comment section
"This Godless culture of contraception"
You a Karen beggin' for cop protection
Bitch, lick the veins on my cock erection
And I gobbled the snot on your twat infection
Keep cops steppin', with the Glock weapon
Nineties

I'm just being stupid y'all
Twitter made me do this
Oh Lord, 2020
We ain't gonna get no better either

Shoot gamble, get a dude cancelled
That's nasty-ass uncle Luke Campbell
In the 90's Inga, Lil' Kim Jones
Since sex sells they bringin' in clones
These hoes sniff blow, coke high
They tried to kill me, but I won't die
So offended, I don't know why
There was sex rap since Blowfly
Say my name, that's the war threat
I been a dirty sex rap porn vet
Before Cardi B was even born yet
I left 'em upset, before Offset
At the penthouse, Caligula orgy
That wet pussy, come waterboard me
Throw the cash roll, eat the asshole
Shoot the last load, from the grass knoll
No condom when you poke vaginas
But you wear a mask for coronavirus
Kid 'n Play-ing the party to be part of the dance-off
Older women seducing me like they Anne Bancroft
Fat lady was singing and then I took her pants off
We making a little love to some Luther Vandross
Rest in peace to peeps in Philly
Brother Naazim and Malik B
2020 had a shit start
But get well soon, we love you Biz Mark
Wet ass p-word
