I'm a white rapper
There's so many of us now
White people like rap now
Ah, ah, yeah

He pushing cars that drop
When is it ever gonna stop?

Slick Rick The Ruler, where's the vocals yo? Come in here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-uh-uh, check out this bizarre
Ayyo! Yo!

Remember Slick Rick The Ruler, remember MC Shan used to wear Puma
Remember Masters of Ceremony, Grand Puba
Remember Daddy Kane Aids rumor
Yo, bring it back, yo
Yo, at the roller rinks, no skates on
Early '80's, girl chase on
Kurtis Blow listed the breaks on
Flavor Flav, Public Enemy clocks, boombox
EPMD made us proud that we was from the Boondocks
Before Boob or Steady B, Heavy D, Mount Vernon
Craig G, Shout rap version, Juice Crew
Rock Box, Run-D.M.C., true hip hop
Before Biggie and 2Pac got shot, there was Scott La Rock
Before we even learned to make beats, we was in the basement
Freestyling, to 45 King breakbeats
But see, rap is corporate now
It's all about endorsements
So now the rich kids love it, so fuck them poor kids now!
