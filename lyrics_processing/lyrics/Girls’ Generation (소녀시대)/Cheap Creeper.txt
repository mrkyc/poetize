You only wear cologne
That comes in the sample size
Your watch says Rolex
But I know you bought it
From some guy on 5th street
Who also sells fake id's
Can't trick me
I've seen it all before you see
 You drive an Audi that you rented from Alamo
You got the hook up through your cousin
Who's the regional manager on weekdays
She gave it to you for one night for free
Don't you wish you drove it in real life?
 You're fronting like you're trump kind of money
When you're really just a 26 year old chump
Living with your mommy
You can say whatever you got to say
But all I see, is that you're just a Cheap Creeper
Sneaky eyes, that only know how to lie (How to lie~)
But the truth I see is that you're just a Cheap Creeper
You might also like Cheap cheap, cheap, Cheap Creeper
Cheap cheap, cheap, Cheap Creeper
 I see you sitting in the corner trying to act smooth
Behind your dark sunglasses watching every move I'm making
Can almost feel your hands on me
So sick babe the way you just (Creep creep)
 You're acting like you're Justin Timberlake
When all you are is just a faker living with your mommy (Mommy)
You can say whatever you got to say
But all I see, is that you're just a Cheap Creeper (Oh you're just a Cheap Creeper)
Sneaky eyes, that only know how to lie (Oh how to lie)
But the truth I see is that you're just a Cheap Creeper (Just a Cheap Creeper)
 Cheap cheap, cheap, Cheap Creeper (You just, you just)
Cheap cheap, cheap, Cheap Creeper (Cheap Creeper)
 You couldn't even buy me a drink if you wanted to
Don't keep acting like you think I'm into you (Oh oh oh~)
 Lemme spell it out so you're no longer confused
Not a chance in hell, no no no (Creep creep)
( You're just a)
 Cheap cheap, cheap, Cheap Creeper (Oh~ Cheap Creeper)
Cheap cheap, cheap  Cheap Creeper  Oh~
You can say whatever you got to say (You got to say yeah)
But all I see, is that you're just a Cheap Creeper (Just a cheap creeper)
Sneaky eyes, that only know how to lie (Oh hey~)
But the truth I see is that you're just a Cheap Creeper (Just a Cheap Creeper)
You can say whatever you got to say (Ooh~)
But all I see, is that you're just a Cheap Creeper (Cheap Creeper)
Sneaky eyes, that only know how to lie (Ooh yeah~)
But the truth I see is that you're just a Cheap Creeper (Oh Ooh~ Cheap Creeper)
 Cheap cheap, cheap, Cheap Creeper (Oh~ Cheap Creeper)
Cheap cheap, cheap (Creep Creep)
 Cheap cheap, cheap, Cheap Creeper
