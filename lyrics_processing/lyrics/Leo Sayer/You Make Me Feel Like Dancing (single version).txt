You've got a cute way of talking
You've got the better of me
Just snap your fingers and I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead
I'm in the spin, you know
Shaking on a string, you know
You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, (ooh) dancing, ah
Quarter to four in the morning
I ain't feeling tired, no, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight and leave on the light
'Cause I don't wanna go home
You put a spell on me
Right where you want me to be
