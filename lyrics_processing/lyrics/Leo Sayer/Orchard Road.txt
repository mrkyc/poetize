It's really such a sad affair
Standing here
Waiting in the cold night air
But I've got to make this call
Cause my heart is breaking
I hear the pips, drop a coin in the slot
Has it been that long?
I thought you'd forgotten me
I know that it's getting late
But it just couldn't wait
Will I have the nerve to say
I just wanna come back
Or should I just go away
I just wanna come back
I've been struck by such bad luck
I need a place, a little happiness and some love
I think, I can see it now
Now let me paint the picture
It's 12 o'clock and the curtains are drawn
They're counting sheep down in Orchard road
You're hanging on the telephone line tonight
Oh, I wish I could be
In Orchard road

I think I got a job
They're gonna call me next week
And I'll be working out of town
Well, it sure beats hanging around
What's that, tomorrow at two?
You're kidding me? No?
Is it all right with you ...?
I don't know what to say
It'll be like a holiday
When you say you're all alone
Makes me wanna come back
And this house is not a home
I just gotta go back
It's 12:10 when I put down the phone
Moon shining down on Orchard road
And I'm feeling like a schoolboy again tonight
I'll see you in my dreams
Of Orchard road
It's funny but I thought I'd never go back
I think sometimes I might lose track
But I remember you and the things we'd do
I want it back
In Orchard road, you've got my heart
I left it in your doorway
In Orchard road, a welcome back
Is waiting there just for me
In Orchard road, the sun will shine again
I know, I know
In Orchard road, you keep my love
Just waiting there for me
It's 8 o'clock and the dawn's arrived
In Orchard road it's breakfast time
I climb in my car and I turn the key
And I'm gone, I am coming home
