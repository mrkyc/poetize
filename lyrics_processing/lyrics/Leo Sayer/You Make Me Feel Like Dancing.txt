You've got a cute way of talking
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers
And I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead

I'm in a spin you know (Ahh)
Shaking on a string you know (Ahh)

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing

You make feel like dancing
