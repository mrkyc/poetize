I got your letter and what it said
I didn't understand
You told me it was over -- au revoir -- see you again sometime
I didn't understand
And overleaf you say that you love me
Meet me on the corner
The usual time -- the usual place
Oh I will be there
Meet me on the corner
I'll see you coming -- then I'll be sure
Sure you'll be there
Oh and I wanna tell you that I love you
Yeah I love you
I see your face -- I see the night
I love you -- yeah I love you
Oh and deep in the night, you know I'll see your eyes
Saying I love you -- Honey I love you
Oh I love you, yes I do
I stood on the corner
All the cars went sweeping by
Did somebody call me -- no there was no-one there
Well I'll go on waiting -- perhaps tomorrow
Another day -- I will be there
Oh and I wanna say that I love you
Just wanna tell ya that I love you
