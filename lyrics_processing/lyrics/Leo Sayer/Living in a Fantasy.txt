You make me shine with all the love that you give
And when I think of you
I keep drifting away
Little by little I love you more every day
I lay in bed but I just can't sleep
I close my eyes and you're all that I see
I can't believe that it's happening to me
Livin' in a fantasy
Ever since you came to me
Livin' in a fantasy
Drownin' in this luxury
Ever since you came to me
Livin' in a dream
And I know there'll be storms up ahead
We'll blow them away, bring back the sun again
For love conquers all, the gloom and despair
Nothing nothing can go wrong
Just as long as you're there
And I see a light on the path up ahead
I know you'll wait on the cliff where you said
I'll hold you close 'til we're right on the edge
