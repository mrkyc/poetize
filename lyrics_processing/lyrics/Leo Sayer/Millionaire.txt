I'm out of money and no-one really cares
The South of France has sunny weather
Pretty boats and lots of millionaires
Now you're not coming home
You like the style and you're staying here
Pretty boys everywhere you go
You lead 'em on and then you disappear
You say you're gonna find a millionaire
- Oh well I wish you luck
And we were never going anywhere
- And now you've had enough
You didn't wanna be
Going broke with a loser like me
And you're a girl who's just gotta be free
And I don't think you'll ever be happy
Chasing a millionaire
Chasing a millionaire
All the streets are dead without you
Empty shops and old abandoned cars
In Saint Tropez your man is waiting
He comes with diamonds to the hotel bar
You say you're not going home
You like the sun and you're staying here
He'll ask if you're on your own
You say "why not" then you both disappear
Now you say you've found your millionaire
- Oh well I don't care
Says he's gonna take you everywhere
- I just don't care
I bet he'll let you down
That kinda guy never hangs around
He's got a girl in every town
And I don't think you'll ever be happy

- Well I don't care
Says he's gonna take you everywhere
- I just don't care
Then one day he's gonna let you down
He'll have you searching every club in town
That kind of guy will only drag you down
You can go and take your millionaire
- Oh I don't wanna know
Tell you that I really do not care
- Ah your life's your own
You see them everywhere you go
Chasing the sun in Alfa Romeos
You gotta catch 'em before they get too old
And I don't think you'll ever be happy
