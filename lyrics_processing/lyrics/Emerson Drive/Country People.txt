If you wonder why I walk this way, why I talk this way
Why I never trade my truck back in
Why I cover up my farmers tan
Why I get my coffee where I get my tractor parts
Know what to do when the truck won't start
Dog in the back, tip of a hat
No, it ain't an act

I come from country people, yeah
No need to hate me
I'ma direct descendent of some dust bowel babies
Little salt of the earth mixed with sunshine and diesel, yeah
Thank God I came from country people
We're boots heed the dirt
We're dots on the map
We're dinner blue, tried and true
Damn good country people

My piece of heaven is a piece of land
A shake of a hand is all you really need to get somethin' bought
When you pay cash like your daddy taught
Why a good time is a good girl
On a slow drive on moonshine, beer in a can
I'm a simple man, I am the way I am
'Cause I come from

Little salt of the earth mixed with sunshine and diesel, yeah
Thank God I came from country people
We're beer in the air
We're chairs in the grass
Stayin' for as long as the firewood lasts
We're boots heed the dirt
We're dots on the map
We're dinner blue, tried and true
Damn good country people
Thank God for country people
