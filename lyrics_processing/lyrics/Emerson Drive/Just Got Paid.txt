Redneck, grease stain on my blue collar
Friday, and I'm down to my last dollar
Still got eight hours but I'm ready for the weekend (weekend)
Lunch break, halfway and I'm still movin'
Missed call, voicemail, baby what you doin'?
Call me back cause your man's got a plan for the weekend (weekend)

Well I just got paid, and I'm on my way to the back of the bank line
Got my stub in the dash, a pocket full of cash, picking up my sunshine
She hops on in, sugar in her grin, sweet as she can be
And we're on our way, and it's all okay cause I just got paid

And I just got paid (whoa-oo-oo-oooo, whoa-oo-oo-oooo)
And I just got paid (whoa-oo-oo-oooo, whoa-oo-oo-oooo)

Back roads turn to concrete, city limits
Spend a half day's pay in a couple minutes
Like to take it town and throw it down on the weekend (weekend)
Run around on the boulevard, bar hoppin'
Throw it in the back, no more window shoppin'
Anything you want, girl you got it on the weekend (weekend)

Friday, at 5 can't come quick enough
I ArmorAlled the dash in my pickup truck
I'm headed to town, I can't be late
I'm meetin' my baby cause I just got paid

Well I just got paid, and I'm on my way to the back of the bank line
