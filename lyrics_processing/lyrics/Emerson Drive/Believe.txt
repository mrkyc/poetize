Five year old Superman
Got a beach towel cape
And he thinks he can
So he takes a dive off the chicken coop
Red behind and a broken foot
Daddy said, "I hope you learned your lesson good"
"Yes sir, next time
I'm gonna wear the Superman boots"
Go on, give it a try
Red rhinestones and a Silvertone
Opry playin' on the radio
He says, "One day I'm gonna be on that stage"
Spends all his time practicin'
Gets a big break and it all begins
Now he waitin' in the wings
And Porter's callin' out his name

Believe
You can fly, you can sing
Take a leap, spread your wings

Believe
Have a little faith, little trust
Little luck, little love and dream
Whatever you want but you've gotta believe
You might also like
Go on, give it a try

Her momma said
It's wastin' tips in an all night diner
Babies, boys and black eye liner
It's a woman's life, it ain't rocket science
But she set her sight on the Ivy League
Got a full free ride and her PhD
Now she's down in Houston
And she's one of NASA's finest
Go on, give it a try
He's 91, she's 85
Said, "By God, we're still alive
Let's go steppin' out before we cash it' in"
Take the Cadillac down to the Broken Spoke
Do the ole two step or cotton eyed joe
Just like the South, they're gonna rise again



Good things come to those who will believe
So believe
You can fly, give it a try, you're gonna see
Whatever you want, whatever you dream
If you believe
Go on, give it a try

You can fly, you can sing
Take a leap, spread your wings
Believe
Go on, give it a try

You can fly, you can dance
Take a leap, take a chance
Believe
Go on, give it a try
