As long as I got me a couple a trees
To hang my hammock underneath in a summer breeze
I'm a lucky man
As long as I got me a dream or two
And a little bit of faith that one day they just might come true
I'm a lucky man
As long as I got this old guitar
I'll be

Johnny Cash in my backyard, playing for my biggest fan
You in your red sundress, hair all down and legs all tan
As long as you put up with me
I'll put the whole world in your hands
If you believe in me then I believe
I'm a lucky man

As long as they keep on makin' parts
For two-door eyesore made in America cars
I'm a lucky man
As long as I got me just enough gas
To get me down to the fishin' hole and back
Yeah I'm a lucky man
As long as I got you by my side
I'll be

Ricky Rudd on Highway 9, drivin' with my biggest fan
You in your red sundress, hair all down and legs all tan
As long as you put up with me
I'll put the whole world in your hands
If you believe in me then I believe
I'm a lucky man

As long as there's beer and barbeque
Football games and me and you
I'll be

The man in that photograph, marrying my biggest fan
You in your wedding dress, hair all up and legs all tan
As long as you put up with me
I'll put the whole world in your hands
If you believe in me then I believe
Yeah, if you believe in me then I believe
I'm a lucky man

I'm a lucky man
Oooooh I'm a lucky man
