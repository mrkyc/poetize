Every time, it's the same old thing
You heat me up like a burning flame
I don't mind if you play your game
'Cause I know I'll make you scream my name
Scream my name. scream my name
Scream my name. scream my name

In the club, doin' my thang
At the bar just sippin a drink
You walked by in those tight ass jeans
Gave me and my homies a wink
When I see that booty poppin' out
It do somethin' strange to me
Like a full moon to a werewolf
You drivin' me crazy
Now I can tell by your attitude
That you know that you're fine as hell
The way you walk, the way you talk
It's like you got somethin good to sell
I respect your hustle girl
But don't try to hustle me
Cause I'm a straight pimp with a gangsta limp
And it runs in the family
You might also like
And the way you shaking it at the club
Tryna make a brother fall in love
You dirty dance me all night long
Then you leave me hanging
Girl, you're wrong

Every time it's the same old thing
You heat me up like a burning flame
I don't mind if you play your game
'Cause I know I'll make you scream my name
Scream my name, scream my name
Scream my name, scream my name

Girl you're hot, your body's on fuego
We fit together like if we was two Lego's
We on the floor and we grind to the beat
I love the way your body's moving when it's grindin' on me
We got the drinks by the dozen and mo' bottles coming but
I dont care, all I want is your lovin'
I'm a sex machine
And girl, you turn me on
I get you off till the break of dawn
And the way you shaking it at the club
Tryna make a brother fall in love
You dirty dancing me all night long
Then you leave me hanging
Girl, you're wrong

Every time it's the same old thing
You heat me up like a burning flame
I don't mind if you play your game
Cause I know I'll make you
I'm gon' make you. I'm gon' make you
I said I'm gon' make you... scream my name

You know I want your body, your body wants me too
You say I'm acting naughty but girl you're naughty too
Your girls wanna leave, I hear them calling you
It's either them or me, girl who you wanna do?
Girl come with me, it's plain to see
We can have a fantasy
Come with me, it's plain to see
You can have your fantasy with me

You know I want your body, your body wants me too
You say I'm acting naughty but girl you're naughty too
Your friends they wanna leave girl they're calling you
