Don't let me show cruelty
Though I may make mistakes
Don't let me show ugliness
Though I know I can hate
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love, show me love
Show me love

I got a crick in my neck, limp in my step
Crampin' in my muscles every time I try to flex
We're broken
Not really in the right mindset to seem open, open
Never really been fought out, like a politician martyr
But you made me listen to your petition rise
Love, let's get over
It's very sad, no more love
All that I could do was remember you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
You know I usually say no
But if you throw me love, I'll throw you some more

Don't let me show cruelty
Though I may make mistakes
Don't let me show ugliness
Though I know I can hate
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love, show me love
Show me love
You might also like
Oh, show me love when I pop out, when I pop out
City I always talk 'bout, what I rap 'bout
Show me love 'cause I love it, I love it
Only thing I could covet in public
I just came to show love, you just glad I showed up
Boy, respect your elder, I'm a fucking Glo'n-up
Foenem told me "Go nuts," bro'nem ain't for no none
But no talkin' at dinner, or to bacon that eat donuts
City on a come up, I might share my bonus
Cases of Coronas and my lil' marijuana
I'ma face a whole dub, O-Z's for my soldiers
Tell them haters hold up, them niggas gotta show love
Don't let me show cruelty
Though I may make mistakes
Don't let me show ugliness
Though I know I can hate
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love, show me love
Show me love

I see you
You see me
Heavy hands hanging on
Release me
Don't let the feeling that I'm all alone
Deceive me
Just let me in and show me love
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love, show me love
Show me love
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love, show me love
