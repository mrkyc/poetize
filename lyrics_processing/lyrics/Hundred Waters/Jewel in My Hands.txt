Wake up, come on, go on, get up, get out of bed, you're tired
But this is most extraordinary
I opened to find, too blind, you'll barely believe it, leave it
Undercover, it's shimmering
I swear it wasn't there a minute ago
Where did it go?
It's underneath you, if I were see through
Would it be better this sparkling?

Jewel in my hands, go on, can't you see it?
It's so hard to understand envy is a poison
And whether or not it's gold, it's the only one I hold
It's the only one I hold
Whether or not it's gold, it's the only one I hold

So come on, go on, goodbye, you know I hate to leave
But I feel I must say something about it
If I were to hide, but why? How criminally unfair
With something so rare, what do you mean?

That there's a possibility
They won't believe me, looks are deceiving
If I reveal it, you think they'll steal it?
Well maybe I'll just tell it to them
Or I could sell it to them
Maybe trade it for something better

Jewel in my hands, go on, can't you see it?
It's so hard to understand envy is a poison
And whether or not it's gold, it's the only one I hold
It's the only one I hold
Whether not it's gold, it's the only one I hold
It's the only one I hold

So, tell me what are you fearing?
That's when it starts disappearing
Open the arms, interfering
