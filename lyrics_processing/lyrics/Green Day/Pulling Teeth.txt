I'm all busted up
Broken bones and nasty cuts
Accidents will happen
But this time, I can't get up
She comes to check on me
Making sure I'm on my knees
After all, she's the one
Who put me in this state

Is she ultra-violent? Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh God, she's killin' me

For now, I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep sayin' my love is true


Is she ultra-violent? Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh God, she's killin' me

Lookin' out my window for someone that's passin' by
No one knows I'm locked in here, all I do is cry

For now, I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
