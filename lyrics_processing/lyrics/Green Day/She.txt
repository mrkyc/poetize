She, she screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with a brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm takin' heed just for you

She, she's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Wakin' up this time
To smash the silence with a brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm takin' heed just for you
Yeah
