You finally got what you want
Someone to look good with and light your cigarette
Is this what you really want?

I figured out what you're all about

Will you pop up again and be my special friend
'Til the end? And when will that be?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
So I hope I won't be there in the end if you come around
