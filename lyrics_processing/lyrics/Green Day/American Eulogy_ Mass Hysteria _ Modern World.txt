Sing us a song of the century
Sings like American eulogy
The dawn of my love and conspiracy
Forgotten hope and the class of '13
Tell me a story into that good night
Sing us a song for me


Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Red alert is the color of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhood's a loaded gun
Idle thoughts lead to full-throttle screamin'
And the welfare's asphyxiatin'
Mass confusion is all the new rage
And it's creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of hysteria

Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deaf-mute's misleadin' the choir
The punchline is a natural disaster
And it's sung by the unemployed
Fight fire with a riot
The class war is hangin' on a wire
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar
When he said, "It's just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the hysteria"

Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

There's a disturbance on the oceanside
They tapped into the reserve
The static response is so unclear now
"Mayday, this is not a test"
As the neighborhood burns
America is fallin'
A vigilante's warnin' ya
Callin' Christian and Gloria


I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

Well, I'm the class of '13 in the era of dissent
A hostage of the soul on a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels without a common ground
I'm gonna light a fire into the underground, well

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I am a nation without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as it's written, fuckin' lies

Well, I wanna take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the "up-to-date" and the neo-gentrified
The high-definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of a beatin' heart
That bleeds beyond a system that is fallin' apart
With money to burn on a minimum wage
Well, I don't give a shit about the modern age, yeah

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
