I done had a Lambo
With a big house in Monte Carlo
Stained Windows
Uhhh baby
And I always wear the best clothes
Gucci this, Prada that
Baby I done bought the whole damn store
Uhh baby

But the material things don't last forever
You and wine are the only two
Things that time makes better
Yeah Yeah
And after everything that
You and I been through, ohh
Baby I'm a grown man so
I learned a few things or two

The Lambo ain't shit without you
(Without you, without, without you)
Big house ain't shit without you
(Without you, without, without you)
So it don't make sense without you
(Without you, without, without you)
No matter what I do
It ain't nothin' without you
You might also like
Without you hoo hoo
Without you hoo hoo
Without you hoo hoo
Nothing matters without you
Without you hoo hoo
Without you hoo hoo
Without you hoo hoo
Nothing matters without you

Had a milli about a million times
Oh, with a voice like mine I done caught about a million dimes
I can tell you baby after millions of trys, ay
(Whoa now)
Baby you're the greatest you made me
Pull the peaches and cream out the refrigerator, ohh yeah

Fake love don't last for ever
You and wine are the only two
Things that time makes better
Yeah Yeah
And after everything that
You and I been through
Baby I'm a grown man so
I learned a few things or two
Bedroom ain't shit without you
(Without you, without, without you)
Big house ain't shit without you
(Without you, without, without you)
So it don't make sense without you
(Without you, without, without you)
No matter what I do
It ain't nothin' without you

Without you hoo hoo
Without you hoo hoo
Without you hoo hoo
Nothing matters without you
Without you hoo hoo
Without you hoo hoo
Without you hoo hoo
Nothing matters without you

All the horses and the Porches
And the fancy mansions
And the sex advances from women
It don't mean a damn thing, no oh
All the cash and all the clothes
Foreign places I go
Nothing to me is as beautiful
And every-body knows
None of this is shit without you
(Without you, without, without you)
Big house ain't shit without you
(Without you, without, without you)
Songs don't mean much no more
(Without you, without, without you)
No matter what I do
It ain't nothin' without you

Good love
I can't deny
If you're not by my side
It just don't feel right
No don't let true love
Pass you by
Nothin' else matters
If you're not by my side
