I have to go away
My flight's not far away
You think your love has strength
But it's just your mind, ah yeah
My heart is in your hand
Waiting for your command
That's enough assurance to believe I'm true
So baby hold on

Just a little while
(Baby, hold on)
Just a little while longer
Just a little while
Ooh, I'm coming back to you
In a little while
(Baby, hold on)
For a little while longer
(I'm coming back, yeah)
In a little while
I'm coming back

A thousand wasted tears
Our love's been strong for years
Your cry is not in vain
'Cause I understand
I'm trying to be the man
You loved when we began
Your cry is not alone
I'm crying, too
You gotta hold on
You might also like
Just a little while
Just a little while longer
(I'm coming back)
Just a little while
I'm coming back to you
In a little while
(Oh baby, hold on)
For a little while longer
(Girl, I'm coming back, yes I am)
In a little while
I'm coming back

If only you knew my love
You wouldn't feel this way
Baby don't be afraid
'Cause I'm coming back to you
Do you hear my plea?
For understanding, wait for me
In my arms you're gonna be
In just...I'm coming home

Just a little while
(Stay a while for me)
Just a little while longer
(Just a little while)
Just a little while
(Oh, oh)
I'm coming back to you
In a little while
(In a little while)
For a little while longer
(Oh yes I am)
In a little while
I'm coming back
(It's gonna be a better day)
Just a little while
(It's gonna be a brighter day)
Just a little while longer
(It's gonna be a better day)
Just a little while
(Oh, it's gonna be a brighter day)
I'm coming back to you
(Gonna be a better day)
In a little while
(Gonna be a brighter day)
For a little while longer
(Gonna be a better day)
In a little while
(Gonna be a brighter day)
