Can I touch you, baby?
Mmm, come here baby
Yeah
Can I?

Can I touch you?
Make you feel so good
I know you want me to
So sweet, my goodness, love so sexy
Won't you come and talk to me?
Can I speak to you, make you feel good?
I know you want me to, so sweet
Goodness, love so sexy
Won't you walk over to me?

In the middle of the night
You walk into my room
The streetlight silhouettes your face
And all of me consumes a special part of me
There's a lonely part of you
And in this we'll find happiness
In a little thing called truth
Can I
