We won't stop, you don't stop

Baby, whenever I'm with you
No one else exists but you
'Cause you're the one for me
Every time that we're apart
You're always in my heart
And there you'll always be

Baby, don't go
Your love's so special
Can't let me go now
If I did wrong, I'm sorry
No other love is for me, oh yeah

Whenever I'm on my way home
Just can't wait to be alone
With you, my baby
Anticipating how you'll feel
Listen to me, I'm for real
When I say I love you

Yo, you cats never want no problem like we want it (Unh-uh)

I'm pushin' new 700 AMGs on it (Talk that ish)
And if you can't see the ice, that means my sleeve's on it (Yeah)
You know I dress as I'm suppose to
Stretch Lex with a chauffeur
Never sober, red Testarossa, cherry Rover
Baguettes in my Jehovah
Me and Puff at the Grammys, sittin' next to Oprah
(And the winner is)
All we hear is platinum that, platinum this
Platinum whips, nobody got no platinum hits (Unh-uh)
Cats know with me, platinum always wrap my wrist (Ha!)
I come to the awards, quadruple platinum chicks
Little ones like 25, what cats get smacked with
Big ones like 45, what cats get clapped with (Take that)
I react sick whenever my dough ain't accurate
Harlem World, Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah, and that's it, come on
