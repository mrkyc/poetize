You tell me you're keepin' it real with me
You tell me that I'm the only one
You say you'll never leave me lonely, girl
That was a lie
I never wanna see your face again
I don't even wanna be your friend
Don't wanna be used by you again
So I'm saying goodbye

Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known
Listen baby

Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Alright
You might also like
I never shoulda put my trust in you
But I never thought you'd let me down
It seems like you get a thrill out of
Out of making me cry
And baby everybody's seen it but me
Cuz I was so blind I couldn't see
I never really needed your help
I could do for myself

Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known

Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Baby, can't you see
I want it for you more
Than you want it for yourself
Always there for you
I was there for you, there for you
What ever you needed
You know what I've gone through for you

I was saying bye-bye baby
Now whatcha gonna do
My love is gone, the money gone and the house too
Now how bout you?
Get away from me and let me clear my mind
This is hurtin' me just to visit you one more time
I know you fine but I ain't gonna get distracted by your charm
I figure this is the beginning, you intended some harm
Remain calm, it ain't no reason to drop the bomb
She'd get 10 points just for being no more
But still, that's the past tense, I was speakin' a theme
You asking me 'bout that woman now, it's a negative team
I had to catch myself before I tried to make her my girl
Start a family and start to bring kids in this world
See like, it's like a gun, it can backfire then shoot you
What's good for the present ain't always good for the future
I shake and shiver, look deeply in the mirrow at myself
Wondering will I make it with someone else
Whatcha gonna do
