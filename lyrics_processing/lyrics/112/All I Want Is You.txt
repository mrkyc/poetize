And we won't stop 'cause we can't stop
No, we won't stop 'cause we can't stop

I heard you got plenty of money
Plenty of clothes
An Escalade, a Porsche, and a house on a hill
A platinum watch, platinum rings, platinum cards
A condo in Beverly Hills
And they say that you're a millionaire
But, baby, I don't really care
'Cause I just need for you to see that all I want is you

I heard you got Gucci belts to match you're boots
Versace wear, Chanel, and Fendi suits
Purple light Benz, purple light Lexus coupe
And you made sure you're friends are 'bout it too, yeah
Say that you're a millionaire
But baby I don't really care
'Cause I just want you to see that all I want is you
Baby
You might also like
All, I really want is you
Believe it, 'cause what I say is true
Not interested in what you do
'Cause all I really want is you

I heard you got sexy eyes, sexy lips, sexy feet
You got sex appeal
Like the way you wear your hair, the way you dress
And girl the way you make me feel
It makes me want you more and more
You're everything I'm lookin' for
And I just need for you to see that all I want is you

Baby, I love your personality
I think that you're all that a woman should be
Like a picture out of a magazine
Or a vision of my wildest dreams
Make me want you more and more
You're everything I'm lookin' for
I just need for you to see that all I really want is you

All, I really want is you
Believe it, 'cause what I say is true
Not interested in what you do
'Cause all I really want is you
All, I really want is you
Believe it, 'cause what I say is true
Not interested in what you do
'Cause all I really want is you
All, I really want is you
Believe it, 'cause what I say is true
Not interested in what you do
'Cause all I really want is you
All, I really want is you
Believe it, 'cause what I say is true
Not interested in what you do
'Cause all I really want is you
All, I really want is you
Believe it, 'cause what I say is true
Not interested in what you do
