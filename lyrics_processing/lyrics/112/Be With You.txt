I used to hang out every night
Used to go from club to club
Looking for true love
But now I found that love in you
No longer have to sleep around
'Cause I have you, baby

Girl, I'm always thinking about you
And all the things you do for me
Makes me so happy
And girl, whenever you need me
My love is always here for you
Babe, I really wanna be with you

There's so much out there for me
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you
So many places I can be
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you

Baby, I've traveled all around the world
Seen a lot of girls but none
Can compare to you
No matter how far I may go
I'll always know that home is you
And that's where I wanna be
You might also like
Girl, I'm always thinking about you
And all the things you do for me
Makes me so happy
And girl, whenever you need me
My love is always here for you
I really wanna be with you

There's so much out there for me
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you
So many places I can be
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you

(Every hour)
Every hour of the day
My thoughts are always of you
(My thoughts are of you, babe)
You are always in my mind
Can't stand to be apart
(Can't stand to be apart)
Whenever we're not together
It seems like forever
Daydreamin' about you
I really wanna be with you
There's so much out there for me
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you
So many places I can be
(So many places)
But the only thing I want
(The only thing I want)
Is to be with you
(Is to be with you)
There's so much out there for me
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you
So many places I can be
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you

(Every day and night)
Every hour of the day
My thoughts are always of you
(My thoughts are of you)
You are always in my mind
Can't stand to be apart
(Can't stand to be apart)
Whenever we're not together
It seems like forever
(Seems like forever)
Daydreamin' about you
I really wanna be with you
There's so much out there for me
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you
(So many places)
So many places I can be
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you
(I wanna be with you)
There's so much out there for me
But the only thing I want
(Every day and night)
Is to be with you
(Whenever you need me)
So many places I can be
But the only thing I want
