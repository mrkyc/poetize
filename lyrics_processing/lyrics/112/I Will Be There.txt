I know it's kinda hard
To get over someone
And try to start anew
A new relationship
No need to rush 'cause you
Have all the time in the world
Right now let's focus on
How we can keep you happy

I can feel it when you hurt
You will never be alone
All those crying days are gone
I'll be here to guide you
Baby, I will be right there
And you know I'll always care, ooh baby

You can call on me (Call on me, call on me)
No matter what the situation (No matter)
I will be there
(Put your trust) Put your trust in me
Whenever you need someone (I will always be there)
I will be right there
