Don't be mad if your girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault your girl's really feeling me
I didn't even know she had a man
Said she didn't have a man
Said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me
Don't be mad if your girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault your girl's tryna get at
I didn't even know she had a man
Said she didn't have a man
Said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me

It's a shame, but this game, baby
I got it in me, ain't no lame when it comes to women
I'm all up in 'em
Sing a song, take 'em home, make 'em moan, then I'm gone
It's really just a game to me

It's a role I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong, she's gonna play
I guess that's why she's callin' me, callin' me
If she's your girl she wasn't yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Don't be mad

How in the hell do you have the audacity
Runnin' up on me tryin' to talk to me, checkin' me?
When you need to be checkin' yourself, clown
Keepin' your girl from screwin' around
You call yourself a playa, tell me how that sound
When your girl is feenin' for me and she wanna be down?

It's a role I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong, she's gonna play
I guess that's why she's callin' me, callin' me

Girl, never seen a dude this down and dirty
Thuggin' but he thought handle business but got high
Plenty women always wanna hold him just cause he rollin'
Claimin' they ain't got no job
But petty niggas they be comin' at you bogus while you clubbin'
Try to take you for the women that be lovin'
Talk about how he always huggin'
Hope I don't have to hit him with the chrome oven
But just because a playa steady ballin' people steady talkin'
He say she say get you bodied
I saw yo girl talkin' buck to 112 and Twista
Walkin' to the truck bout to get prodded
No snoozin'
All the bitches be a big ball of confusion
Niggas trippin' off the ladies they be losin'
Pardon my intrusion
That chick about to have you cruisin' for a bruisin'
Cause there's rules in this game
Playa don't check the pimp, go and check yo hoe
Give her that good third in a flip flop colored Excursion
For a hit of that blow
Don't try to calm lil' momma down but you know them freak bitches be
Don't get done in like Pretty Tone cause yo kitty gone
Yo trick just chose me
You ain't cut like comedians tailors
You ain't one of them get higher than helium playaz
Or three tone chameleon gators
You can't never spit fire on no CD and fade us
Lame, greedy instigators
Can't see how you mad just cause she date me
I could never let a girl make me
There's plenty women out here dog so don't hate me
(Don't hate me)
Don't be mad if your girl wants to leave with me
