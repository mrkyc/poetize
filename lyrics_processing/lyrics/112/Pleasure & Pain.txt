You always said you loved me
Though my mind right now's not sure
You always were there for me
Though my heart never feels secure
Why can't you take the further step
To let me know you really care
'Cause now I'm feeling driven
Into a love that's not right there

Why do you make me feel this way
Feeling betrayed feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so bad
Feeling so hurt feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn
Feeling so lost I'm feeling so burned
If you really cared you'd make a change
So I can feel the pleasures and not the pain

After all I've said
You still have it set in your head
That you don't really care about me
Why can't you seem to believe
That I'm the only one for you
I gave all my love to you, oooh
And after all I've done for you
You never seemed to love me the way that I love you
You might also like
Why do you make me feel this way
Feeling betrayed feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so bad
Feeling so hurt feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn
Feeling so lost I'm feeling so burned
If you really cared you'd make a change
So I can feel the pleasures and not the pain

Baby, can you feel me
It hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
I just can't take it no more, baby
Girl, make a change
So I can feel the pleasures and not the pain

Why do you make me feel this way
Feeling betrayed feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so bad
Feeling so hurt feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn
Feeling so lost I'm feeling so burned
If you really cared you'd make a change
