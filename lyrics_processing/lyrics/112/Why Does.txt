All the love you've given me
So special seems to be no limit
I'll do anything
There's no boundaries to how we can grow
How can I let you know
Girl, let me sit and think, oh

Why does the wind blow?
Why does the sun shine?
(Why does the wind blow?)
Why does the rain fall, down on my face?
(I need to know)
Why does the Earth spin?
(I need to know)
Why do the waters reach the shore?
(Oh baby)
And tell me, tell me why
Why do I love you like I do?

Oh, in the past
You were there when I was down
My friends could not be found
Your touch kept me so strong
But our love didn't fade away
Instead, it sails inside the sky
That's why I must ask why
I must ask why
You might also like
Why does the wind blow?
(Why does it blow?)
Why does the sun shine?
(I need to know)
Why does the rain fall, down on my face?
Why does the Earth spin?
Why do the waters reach the shore?
And tell me, tell me why
Why do I love you like I do?

I ask myself the question time and time again
(Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you
(Yes, I do)
Oh, why did you have to hurt me
And leave me all alone?
(Baby, I love you)
Oh, baby, I love you
Now I'm all alone when I need your love

Why does the wind blow?
(Tell me, baby)
Why does the sun shine?
(Why does the rain fall?)
Why does the rain fall, down on my face?
(Tell me)
Why does the Earth spin?
Why do the waters reach the shore?
And tell me, tell me why
Why do I love you like I do?
(Tell me why)
Why does the wind blow?
(Why does it blow?)
Why does the sun shine?
(Tell me why)
Why does the rain fall, down on my face?
(Tell me, baby)
Why does the Earth spin?
(Tell me why)
Why do the waters reach the shore?
And tell me, tell me why
