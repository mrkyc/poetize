Ma
I can't get enough
I'm a fiend for peaches

Limousines to beaches

Deans and teachers

Scored in between the bleachers
Chicks used to be
Seam and speechless

X-5 got so many
Screens and features
Thats why I threw marines
On each-trice
Look its the F-A the B-O the L-O the U-S

Believing I'm lookin'

A freak in the evening
