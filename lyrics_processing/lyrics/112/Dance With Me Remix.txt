Bad Boy
Let's dance (7x)
Yo, everybody report to the dance floor
Report to the dance floor
Bad Boy baby
112, Beanie Sigel
Here we go!

God damn, guess who stepped up in the place?
The kid with two rubbers on his waist
Two steppin' to the base
And I don't usually step up in the place
I usually pull that lead out, ready to get a lead out
But damn, since I stepped up in the place
I'm try'na touch you, squeeze you, tell you what's the case
Before I bust, you squeeze, outta telly and a case of Cris'
I'm tryin' to take you to the telly, bust in ya ffffff
Tryin' to lure me out on the dance floor
I'm tryin' to get it twirly on the dance floor
Everything remains the same, might spit-talk to it
Then "Change The Game", might Crip-Walk to it
But never Harlem shake it, Harlem make it, Harlem break it
Dawg, I ain't hardly made this
You talkin' to one of Roc's finest
And do rewind this; it's Bad Boy's finest!
