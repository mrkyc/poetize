Uh, uh
Catch me in the spot, no Cease in the drop
About half an ounce, inside the zip-lock
Knockin' the new One-One-Deuce
On the deuce, me and my old flame
And his name is Bruce
But (nigga) blew my eye when his girl drove by
Told me bye then he winked his eye
I'm too dime fo' this, too fly to curse
Threw his jacket out first then BAM! in reverse

Oh, baby you need to know I've been in love
And I've never known love like this
I need to know just how you feel
Let me know if this love is real

I'm tired of wasting time on you
So tell me what you wanna do
Is it another man holding your hand?
Why is this a mystery?
Oh, baby can't you see?
Girl, you're the only one I'll ever want
The only one I'll ever need
You might also likeI'm tired of wasting time on you
So tell me what you wanna do
Is it another man holding your hand?
Why is this a mystery?
Oh, baby can't you see?
Girl, you're the only one I'll ever want
The only one I'll ever need

Oh, baby I think it's time for us to grow
We've been friends now for far too long
The way you kiss, it turns me on
Let me know if you feel this strong

I'm tired of wasting time on you
So tell me what you wanna do
Is it another man holding your hand?
Why is this a mystery?
Oh, baby can't you see?
Girl, you're the only one I'll ever want
The only one I'll ever need
I'm tired of wasting time on you
So tell me what you wanna do
Is it another man holding your hand?
Why is this a mystery?
Oh, baby can't you see?
Girl, you're the only one I'll ever want
The only one I'll ever need
Give me your love
Don't you know that I, I need your love
I need you here in my life, baby, everyday
Baby, please, I'll take good care
I'll take care of your needs
I need you here with me

Let's pretend like we friends
And do our own thing (c'mon)
We can chitty-bang-bang
But let the phone ring (I like this)
From the first night, knew you wasn't true
Ex-girl came through, she said she miss you (uh, huh)
Panties in the bathroom sink, hot pink (hot pink)
What's a girl like me supposed to think? (c'mon)
I'm a Bad Girl (Bad Girl)
You shady? I get shady (shady)
Tie up your old lady and put holes in your Mercedes
Go baby

I'm tired of wasting time on you
So tell me what you wanna do
Is it another man holding your hand?
Why is this a mystery?
Oh, baby can't you see?
Girl, you're the only one I'll ever want
The only one I'll ever need
I'm tired of wasting time on you
So tell me what you wanna do
Is it another man holding your hand?
Why is this a mystery?
Oh, baby can't you see?
Girl, you're the only one I'll ever want
