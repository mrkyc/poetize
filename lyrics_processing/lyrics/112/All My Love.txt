When I look into your eyes I see you're lonely
Won't you come with me
I wanna know from you
If ever you needed someone
Could you call on me
Let me touch you, let me hold you, let me squeeze you
Give your love to me
Baby, stop wasting time
And let's get together, baby

Let me show you
Can I get to know you?
Baby, let me give you
All my love
(I will give it to you, baby)
Let me show you
Can I get to know you?
(Can I get to know you?)
Baby, let me give you
(I wanna give it to you, baby)
All my love

Let me touch the secret places known to no one
What's your fantasy?
I'm giving you all of me
I wanna please you 'til you can't take it no more
Can I take you to a place where no one finds you
Let's forget about time
It's all about you and me, ooh-hoo
Can we get together, baby?
You might also like
Let me show you

Baby, let me give you
All my love
(Can we get together, baby)
Let me show you
(Baby, let me show you)
Can I get to know you?
(Can I get to know you?)
Baby, let me give you
All my love (All my love)

When I'm with you something takes control of me
When we're together, can't you see it's destiny
When I'm near you it feels like you're a part of me
(And baby, I don't want you to go away from me, no)

Let me show you
Can I get to know you?
Baby, let me give you
All my love
(All of my love, all of my love)
Let me show you
Can I get to know you?
Baby, let me give you
(I wanna give it to you, baby)
All my love
(Can I get to know you, baby?)
Let me show you
Can I get to know you?

All my love
(Let me give you all my love)
Let me show you
(I wanna know, I need to know)
Can I get to know you?
(Can I get to know you, baby?)
Baby, let me give you
(Let me give you all of me)
All my love
(Let me give you all my love)
Let me show you
Can I get to know you?
Baby, let me give you
