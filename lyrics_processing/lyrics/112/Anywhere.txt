Here we are, all alone
You and me, privacy
And we can do anything, your fantasy
I wanna make your dreams come true
Can you hear? She's calling me
Between your legs, loud and clear
I wanna talk back to her, make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

We can make love in the bedroom
Floating on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway, making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower, both of our bodies drippin' wet
On the patio, we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor, as I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere

I love the way your body feels on top of mine
So take your time, we got a night
Girl, you know, I like it slow
And I know you like it too, baby
Please don't stop, I feel it now
You feel it too, you're shivering
Ooh, you put me close to you, just let it flow
There's no other place to go
You might also like
We can make love in the bedroom
Floating on top of my waterbed
(Tell me how you like it, baby)
I'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair
(Tell me can I drive you crazy)
In the hallway, making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere (We can do it baby)
I can love you in the shower (in the shower), both of our bodies drippin' wet (When you're touching me)
On the patio, we can make a night you won't forget
(We can do it all night long)
On the kitchen floor, as I softly pull your hair
(Tell me how you like it)
We can do it anywhere, anywhere

Z too hot to stop so we goin' from the bedroom to the floor
Let you know a nigga miss you when out on tour
When our tongues touch, have a playboy sing it much
Roll a Dutch, let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you, what kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I bump hard 'til you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true player's what I seem to you
And if you want it, we can do it in the Black 500 wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride 'cause I'm hot now
You got me goin', I don't think I wanna stop now
Z feinin' like a criminal on lockdown
So let's get a way to get away
You gettin' hot, baby, please don't melt away
I got a crib on the beach in Palmetto-way
And here's your personal key to see me everyday, 112
We can make love in the bedroom (In the bedroom)
Floating on top of my waterbed (On my waterbed)
I'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair
(Let me run my fingers through your hair)
In the hallway, making our way beside the stairs
(Tell me how you like it)
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower (in the shower), both of our bodies drippin' wet
On the patio, we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor, as I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere

We can make love in the bedroom
Floating on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you, running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway, making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower, both of our bodies drippin' wet
On the patio, we can make a night you won't forget
