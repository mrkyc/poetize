Mmm (Woo)
Ahh, hey
Hey, hey

Hot air balloon
Don't you go up too soon
Feel the green air, taste green water
I'm lost in all the color

It's like Rocky climbin' on a rocket ship (Ship, ship)
Two seconds from fallin', then you take a dip (Dip, dip)
Missin' colors in my rainbow
Ocean blow different than before
Before the beginning of time, I still flew
I would still fly, or did I float?

Hot air balloon
Don't you go up too soon
Feel the green air, taste green water
I'm lost in all the color
Oh, hot air balloon
Don't you go up too soon, free
I'll relay in the water
I'm lost in all the color

My ego go wherever I go, oh, friend of mine (That's my friend!)
Ocean wave high, the current currently got me
Sun greets us like waves do
Emotions come in waves, too
Feelin' wavy like oceans do
Feelin' blue (Blue)
Feelin' blue for you, oh, hey
Don't you go too soon (Don't go too soon)
No, no, no, no, no, no, ahh
I'll wake with you, I'll make coffee for you
We'll speak of things, small talk, mostly starin'
Sharin' eyes over napkins, curtains swayin', tablecloth laughin'
Feelin' clingy, feelin' needy, oh well, who is it? I'll be
Promise you won't text me, you'll call me
I need to hear you speak, need to hear you speak
Need to hear you think, need you

Hot air balloon
Don't you go up too soon
Feel the green air, taste green water
I'm lost in all the color
Oh, hot air balloon
Don't you go up too soon, free
I'll relay in the water
I'm lost in all the color
Hey, hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey
Hey, hey
Da-da-da, da-da-da

Da, da (Gray)
Da, da (Purple)
Da, da (Green)
Da, da (Green)
Hey (Green)
Green (Green)
Hey, hey (Oh)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da
Oh, ooh
Ooh, yes
Ahh, hey (We can take)
Don't you go up too soon
Don't you go up too soon (Don't you go up too soon)
Don't you go up too soon, no, no, no
