Me hosin' sweet ones
Niggas that like me
Dudes that dodge me
Girls wanna fight me
'Cause like Kimmy
I'm talkin' pretty
Confident as a D like Willie
Yeah down to Earth like Freddy
Down to ride, no Billy
At home it was Kool Aid packs and Disney
Lizzie McGuire and One Saturday Morning on the weekends
Never had a pair of Jordans, don't want none
My jump shot don't need sneakers
More costly than I can afford them
Rice Krispies Treats and noodles
Home Alone Macaulay Culkin
'Cause sometimes, 'cause sometimes
I need more space than thoughts can give me
More sky than God provides me
And TV so I won't get lonely (Lonely)
Where do the ants go?
Why do they run away?
Leave me alone now
Why can't I make you stay?
You might also likeI got a JanSport book sack
A girl that be talkin' 'bout me in third period
Oh well (Oh well)
The beat was still made for me
Re-runs of Martin waitin' on me
More cake for me, cake for me
Amy scare me, Ashley make me jealous
And Cheryl Lynn my best friend
Brian my boyfriend, Kay is his father
But his love letters be sweeter than sno-balls in the east
And Freezy Street all wrapped in one love letter
And a warm sweater in December
I'm better, I'm better
I became whatever
Where do the ants go?
Why do they run away? (Run away now)
Leave me alone now
Why can't I make you stay?
I'm prettier than a Sunday
On Mondays I be trippin'
My momma want me to wash the dishes
While she make my brother lazy and distant
Fuck it, I'm movin' when I'm eighteen
Fast forward ten years later
It's the same routine
And I'm complaining
Catching bucks, mood change
Like it's a new thing
I want everything on anything
Put clothes in the basket
Or a Hummer truck
Man, my life funny as fuck
Like Bruce with a cut
Just my luck, I'd end up
Famous and blunt
Rollin' a blunt, turned down
While everybody is busy turnin' up
Can you turn my music up?
Hey turn my music up
Where do the ants go?
Why do they run away?
Leave me alone now
Why can't I make you stay?
Where do the ants go?
Why do they run away?
Leave me alone now
Why can't I make you stay?
I saw you throw a universe once
