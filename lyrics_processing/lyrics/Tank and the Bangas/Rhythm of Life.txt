The moment you tied your own shoes
Or spelled your name in your alphabet soup
Or told your mom that you're walking
To the bus stop by yourself (Don't talk to strangers)
The moment you fell on the schoolyard (Ouch)
Or scraped your knee falling into his arms
You knew from the start that you're walking
And you gotta do it by yourself

It's the rhythm of life
When you're humming and singing
All the words that you don't know
It's the rhythm of life
When you're grabbing and touching
And loving who? You don't know

The moment you got your first car
The places it took you tell me how far
You were when you ran out of gas
And wanted to go to the store (store)
You might also likeIt's called being lost and being found
When highways of life take you all around
Experience shows you the wrong way
So you never have to go alone

It's the rhythm of life
When you're humming and singing
All the words that you don't know
It's the rhythm of life
When you're grabbing and touching
And loving who? You don't know
It's the rhythm of life
When you're kissing and holding
Onto people that you barely know
It's the rhythm of life
When you're walking or talking
All the things that you really don't know

I'm learning
I'm living
Connecting to love that's within me
I'm growing
Please show me
This love is what you showed me
I'm learning
I'm living
Connecting to love that's within me
I'm growing
Please show me
This love is what you told me
Tell me all the things that you want to do
Tell me all the things that you want to see
As long as you've got your voice
Got your choice
Tell me all the things that you want to do
Tell me all the things that you want to see
As long as you've got your voice
Got your choice
Tell me all the things that you want to do
Tell me all the things that you got to see
As long as you've got your voice
Got your choice
Tell me all the things that you want to do
Tell me all the things that you got to see
As long as you've got your voice
Got your choice
It's the rhythm of life

When you're kissing and holding
Onto people that you barely know
