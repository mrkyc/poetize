Bags don't roll like they used to
Lines don't flow like they supposed to
I wake up late sometime, I would have left my mind
If it wasn't screwed on like it's supposed to
I'm really contemplating just laying here
I could avoid the traffic
I could just scroll the 'netty
Mm, my baby says that I shouldn't go nowhere
But my flight is waiting
Here I am still debating

Why, oh, why do I even try?
I always seem to forget
Something I left in the bag, now it's in the trash
And I'm already so late

TSA keeps taking my shit
My emotions, my perfume, body mist, gel
Edge control, cologne, pocket knife, lighter, hair products
All that, you know, all that, like
TSA keeps taking my shit
They stop me, why they stop me? Call somebody
Say I'm really buggin', man, these cats be frontin'
Say I'm really frontin', man, these cats be buggin'

Oh, no (Oh, no), they just took my cologne
I just got this new bottle and now it's all gone
What do you think I'm gonna do with it anyway?
Spray-spray you to death, would you please give me a break?
Didn't wanna check a bag, last time had me screwed
So I packed this carry-on thinking that it would go smoother

Why, oh, why do I even try?
I always seem to forget
Something I left in my bag and now it's in the trash
And I'm already so late (So late)

TSA keeps taking my shit (Every time I stand in line)
I'm going through the motions
Did she just take my lotion? (Oh, no)
TSA keeps taking my shit
Stop me, why they stop me? Call somebody
I'm feeling real violated, she keep touching me
TSA keep taking my shit (She's feeling violated)
She's feeling violated
So very violated
TSA keeps taking my shit (She's feeling violated)
I'm feeling violated
So very violated
Girl, lollipops, bobby pins, girl
Girl, my dignity, like
Why, oh, why do I even try?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, I don't like it
They took my sunscreen, they took my lotion
Took my man cologne, girl
Lord, like
They took all type of stuff, like
I'm going through the motions (Bitch)
Touchin' on me, bitch
What's gon' happen, what, the lotion gon' take off the plane?
They took my Calgon away
I looked at the Black girl for some sympathy
Not the edge control, sis
Not the shea butter, think of your mother
Think of your sister, think of your daughter
