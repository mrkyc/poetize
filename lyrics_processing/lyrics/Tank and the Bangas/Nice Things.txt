(Blast it)
(Ah, hahaha)
Later, later, later, alligator
Smell the vapors, okay, okay
I ain't got no chill
I ain't got your mail

You should do some nice things for me
Nice things for me
Gucci purse, Gucci watch
That's what's up, buy my love
You should buy some ice cream for me
You should do some nice things, nice things

So I hit him on a Tuesday (Tuesday)
Making sure I ain't too busy
That the only time I'm in your city
'Cause I ain't had no nice things in a minute
Why don't we go shopping for the vintage?
I need a OG with a goatee
Got a Cadillac, no car seat
Keep it pine fresh with that evergreen
On the lake front, that's a summer scene
Makes common sense like August Greene

You should do some nice things for me
Gucci purse, Gucci watch
That's what's up, buy my love
Nice things for me
(It's a good love, good love)

It's the weekend (Weekend)
I already planned my weekend
Hit up your friends, text my ex-boyfriend
Is we chilling or what? We should link up
Kissy face and make up, like we made up
Get the suicide doors, I want more, that's a score
Hitting beaches in LA
Pretty boys out in The Bay
They open up the door for me
Can you bring it back? Shutting down stores for me?
Can you, uh?
Can you open up the door for me?
Can you bring it back? Shutting down the stores for me?
Can you, uh, can you open up a bag for me?
Slide the keys to the motherfucking Jag

You should do some nice things for me
Gucci purse, Gucci watch
That's what's up, buy my love
You should do some nice things for me
(It's a good love, good love)
You should cook some white beans for me
(Aw, I like red beans tho)
You should do some nice things
Nice things
Later, later, alligator
Smell the vapor, smell the vapor
Okay, okay
Three-time, three-time, three-time, three-time
I been chilling with my ex on the weekend
