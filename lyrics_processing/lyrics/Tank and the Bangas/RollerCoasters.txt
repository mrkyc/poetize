Why the feeling of throwing up brought about some type of excitement
That they didn't receive on a regular day?
When did feeling sick become equivalent to thrill?
When did nausea become the new X pill?
I've always wondered why people rode rollercoasters
And I remember, I remember when I did

It's the butterflies, and the fireflies, fighting in my stomach
(the light between their wings)
Scared to fly
I might come down
Think I'm ready now
Getting back in line
It's the way it jerks your neck
The way the body has to reflex
The way stomach reacts
It's the thrill concept
It's the twist and the curve
It's the up and the swerve
It's the feeling of your nerves sitting on the front edge of their seats
Front row, eyes open
Tears coming from thrill of sight
Moving as fast as light
Laughing for no reason
Screaming for everything you shouldn't have said in that fight
Rollercoasters
It's like meeting God with a kite in your left hand
String still twisted around your forefinger
Right hand still gripping the safety rail
There is this moment, where you feel like you're in an ocean of your butterflies
This is the moment when you get free and you let your arms fly
You might also likeIt's the fireflies, and the butterflies, fighting in my stomach
(the light between their wings)
Scared to fly
I might come down
Think I'm ready now
Getting back in line
This is the instant you let go
And you let your fingers fly
How you're flying now
How does it feel to beat the wind?
You're at the zenith
There are nothing but tears, freedom, and fear in your right hand now
Time to throw it in the sky now
Time to drown in your own thrill
Riding a rollercoaster is like losing your breath and finding it in your will
You're jumping on the back of your fears
And you're taking them for a ride
You're seeing yourself when you were five
It is surreal
It's the things you grab and hold onto for a while
You're getting ready for the drop
Hey, you're too busy riding your fears to remember you're afraid of heights
It's the butterflies, and the fireflies, fighting in my stomach
(the light between their wings)
Scared to fly
I might come down
Think I'm ready now
Getting back in line
So why is it so exciting to be so scared?
Like feeling your heart roam through your body only to find its place in your hands
But you can't wait to get back in line
You gotta get on one more time
Can't wait to tell your friends about the drop, and how it looks from the very top
You see, rollercoasters, rollercoasters are for people who have never been in love
They want to know how it feels to just fall
(fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly, fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly)
It's the butterflies, and the fireflies, fighting in my stomach
(the light between their wings)
Scared to fly
I might come down
Think I'm ready now
Getting back in line
