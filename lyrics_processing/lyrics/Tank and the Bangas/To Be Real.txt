Ghetto twins on the spins
Hustler full of that  Crown
On the late deck swinging so you know we drinking
Roll the Ls up on the trunk of the truck
So you know we stankin'
Boom clack bass heavy in the back
Kodaks and throwbacks
Pink smoke and cognac, I'm trippy
Booboo fiddy and my Tims is pretty
I got my girls with me
Gabby, Brittney, and Brittney bringing candy
We all chilling on that red lax leather pants
Dookie plaid short shorts
Bitch I'll take ya mans
Snowballs and alcohols
Sweating out my blow
Bounce on ones and twos
I'm bout to hit the wall
I lead the sleazy breezy
West Coast so then please believe me
Sonically I'm made to hit thee
Like bombing up the levees
Sipping on his bitch
Swinging swipping on the swish

They know it's on

Just being honest

There's a house party by my boy Derrick house
Everybody hop up in the back of the truck
We 'bout to head out
Women, liquor niggas jiggin' playing Jenga
Them stank hoes
Them earthy hoes
Them messy hoes from Kenner
Say boyfriend why you acting funny?
You even got money?
You know I've been waiting for you
On Claiborne with an attitude
But you change it all around when you come around
I'm so happy I smile
To be real
Just being honest
(Just being honest)
To be real
Just being honest

I know this girl
She loves to keep it real
Work it work it
Keep it real
Work it work it
Lemme see you when you
Be real
Ms. Tank, she be real
, she be real
Hands on your knees
Hands on your knees
This is what I want you to do for me
Yeah, get with me
Move it like a washing machine
Around and
Around and
Around and around and around
These things are always sitting around
And now I know I'm lost and found
(You already know)
When you find a piece of what you had
You never realize what you gave
To be real
Just being honest
(Just being honest)
To be real
Just being honest
(Just being honest)
Keep it real
You got to be honest
Yeah
