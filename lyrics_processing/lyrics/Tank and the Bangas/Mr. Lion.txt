I've been waiting on you
You comin'?

Hey there, Mr. Lion
Why you roar so big? Why so loud?
Hey there, Mr. Lion
Don't you cry sometimes? Why so proud?

When you are alone do you know how to be?
And loneliness lays at your throne, I know
A king spends most days all alone by the sea
Drifting and roaming the shores

So hey there, Mr. Lion
Why you seem so sad? Why run out?
Kill anything that laughs at you
But when love came to, you run south
You say that love has nowhere to go
Takes its time, you know, surely you go slow
But I believe the biggest mistake is the risk that you take
Thinking she'll always stay
What if you're too late?
You might also like
When you are alone do you know how to be?
And loneliness lays at your throne, I know
A king spends most days all alone by the sea
Drifting and roaming the shores

I know you're afraid to be
Someone easy and unsure but
The things that I have to show you
Goes beyond the pride of your own, so
Listen to what love shows you
From this view, I can see you're scared too
It takes courage to fall, feels so new
There's no wins and doubt, no shortcut route to love
Love, love, love

Wishing on the biggest of stars
For you to return to who you are
Cast the net and capture the sky in a jar
Put your claws away, care for your heart

I see the moon shine but
I see a star I like, a Mr. Lion, Mr. Lion
I see the bright eye but
Catch a fallen star I like, a Mr. Lion, Mr. Lion
I see the moon shine but
I see a star I like, a Mr. Lion, Mr. Lion
I see the bright eye but
Catch a fallen star I like, a Mr. Lion, Mr. Lion
I see the moon shine but
I see a star I like, a Mr. Lion, Mr. Lion
I see the bright eye but
