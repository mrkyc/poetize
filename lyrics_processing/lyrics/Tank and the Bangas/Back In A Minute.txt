This just a lil' hit for the summer
Big deal

Woah, here I go
I'm jumping out a green balloon (Jump), Geronimo
Man, I like big wheels, twenty-fours
And I let the paint drip like the hose (Ah)
Woah, big cars
Suicide doors, I got scars
You don't know my life, my life is hard (Life is hard)
Make me wake up in the morning, roll a 'gar
Chinchilla for the winter, Cosby sweater, Clair
Queen Latifah, regal living, single, but I'm busy, like to clear up
Oh, you ain't notice I was gone yet?
Summer jets and family trips and still a **** could not

Relax, I been gone for a minute
Told you I'd be back, just chill for a minute
Last time I checked, you was on for a minute
Miss me, miss me with that ****, I'll be back in a minute

With my good vibes, good vibes
Man I like good times and good wine
Plus I got my feet up, recline
And I'm watching Cita on the wifi (Wifi)
I cannot just go away
Can you bring me back, back to my old ways?
Told my mom and dad I'm praying for some better days
Only good vibes Friday to Friday
I'm looking for a highway to get high on Mondays
And I'm so up there, I might be going sideways
Kamikaze Sundays, leaning on my Mondays
Babyface Like Usher, I just want it my way
You might also like
Relax, I been gone for a minute
Told you I'd be back, just chill for a minute
Last time I checked, you was on for a minute
Miss me, miss me with that ****, I'll be back in a minute

With my feet up, chillin' for the summer, what's up?
Rollin' with the big wheels, tell them boys to pull up
You are not a big deal, hater, lose my number
Miss me with that bull****, ask me did I stutter?
So, so what? Tell your brother, sister, cousin, mother, lover
I'm real poppin' up in there, and I run it up in here
I ain't even from around here, man, I only roll with big deals
Homie, big wheels with a big grill
Cotton, cocky with it, fresh gang, shoe gang
Wanna kick it, that's a soccer fitted, Bruce Willis with the senses
White tennis with a clutch from Venus, I ain't never flew Spirit
****, I'm spendin', I don't rent it if I get it, look
Chill chick, I got a lot of **** in my moshpit
Light skin and dark skin, you messy like a side chick
Coming with a banger, it ain't summer, but it's hot, kids
Might just have to drop it 'cause I wanna start a riot

Men just gotta relax, relax
Men just gotta relax, relax
Men just gotta relax, relax
