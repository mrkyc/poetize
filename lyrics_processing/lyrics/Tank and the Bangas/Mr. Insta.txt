Why you got my business on display
Facebook out here tryna ruin my day
Mista Insta can you pls help me
I need to delete my page
Where's the delete button?
If I'm being honest
I don't want no problem
If I were an island
You would be my only option
Lookin for em
But instead I'm chillen in my bed
With a million one thoughts runnin through my head
And a million words running thru my fingers
Caught up in the rapture

Fucking with my algorithm (random mention)
I didn't really like that picture
Got a 1000 likes
Coulda got a thousand more
Used the selfie stick and everything
Even had a filter change
WHat a waste of time
What's the bottom line
When you know that halk this shit it out of line
Postin selfies
Tryna get s some likes
Get 100K and think you verified (pause)
Lose 100K and wanna end ya life
If you gotta blue check
Then you know I'm checking for you
I know I know all you do (true)
So As long as I post
I know I'm doing the most
I mean I'm doing my best
Don't forget to comment
I'm askin
Man if ain't nobody checkin for you
And you should see that as a luxury
My DMs full of business and people sending they plugs to me
They think I'm bout ta sign em like executive
Correlating talent with the thorough kind of head they gve e
Good love
A milli followers can't tell you what you should love
Insta hustlin can feel just like a good drug
But them addictions is deadly it's like a twisted up medley
Invalidatin and hatin, we gettin cooked up
Swear I never needed to be cast on the daily
Would I trade the clout for the peace of mind? Nigga maybe
But who am I to downplay the privilege of the platform
I get to be myself and at the end, somebody pay me
It's a blessin so I try to limit stressin
Take all the silver linings of the clouds and simple lessons
Remembering my worth is in the love that I put out
And not determined by a button that I hope somebody pressin
Around this time
Right about now
A need, a search, a want, a hunger
A thirst
A reliance only on self
For assurance
For like
What is that like?
How does that be
How do you not know
What it is to be fly
To feel food without someone telling you
