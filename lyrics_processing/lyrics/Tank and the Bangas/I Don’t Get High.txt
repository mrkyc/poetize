Scared of it all
Scared that it's gon' drop and fall
I'm scared of it all
It all, all

What if she gets too big for the stars?
Or her head in the clouds, is it all the same?
Am I playing around with my gift? Is this it?
Is it all just in my head? Ooh
I didn't wan' fall in love, but I couldn't even walk straight
I'm trippin', fallin' over ashtrays and mistakes
But I'll be okay (Okay, okay, okay, okay)

I don't get high no more, I don't (High, high, high)
I don't get high no more, I don't (High, high, high)
Spaced out like Neptune
With green smoke, just weed smoke
The feeling, no ceilings

They callin', they waitin' for me
I'm faded, some day ends
Frustrated 'cause I never made it
Bitch, you never made it, uh

Poppin' peppermint sporadic, got Altoids like ashtrays
Chewing gum in Paris, shit, this has become a hamper
But I can't shake like wall in, or lose like a phone charger
Anybody seen my phone charger? (Yo, where's my phone charger?), shit
Lost that thought, it came back like prodigal
Started something, now it follows me
In a dark room where no one can find me
Mama shouldn't barely recognize me
My family might just despise me
Giving out hugs that don't last long
Memories, hoodies, and menthol
I don't get high no more, I don't (High, high, high)
I don't get high no more, I don't (High, high, high)


Come get high
