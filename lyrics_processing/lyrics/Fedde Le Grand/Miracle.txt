I know it's gonna take a miracle
I know it's gonna take a miracle

Tears fall, it's all fair in love and war, oh oh oh
You say you don't care, don't know what you're lying for
Oh baby baby you can try to deny the way you feel inside
You can tell me all these lies but I won't believe 'em

Cause when I look in your eyes I can see
The way that you really feel about me, I know

I know it's gonna take a miracle tonight
And I'm not giving up until I have your love
You're what's missing in my heart, I don't know why
You just won't give it up, you're all I'm thinking of
I know it's gonna take a miracle tonight
To change the way you feel about me baby
I hope you're ready for this fight cause you can resist me all you want
But I'm not gonna stop until you're mine
Until you're mine (Until you're mine)
I know it's gonna take a miracle
I know it's gonna take a miracle, oh oh
