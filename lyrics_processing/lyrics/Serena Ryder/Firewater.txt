The kind of remedy that will undo ya
Tryna get the pain to go away
Sayin' all the things you shouldn't say
You're acting like you never even knew me
You're everything you never wanted to be
Tryna get the pain to go away
Playin' all the games you shouldn't play
Fillin' me up, like I'm a cup
Never enough, bottom is up
All rise to the remedy
All rise
Hookin' me up like I'm a drug
Don't wanna stop, never enough
All rise to the remedy
The remedy
Just pour me another one
Somethin' to make me numb
Or make me too blind to see
See what you did to me
Just pour me another one
It's something I'm leanin' on
Don't get me wrong, I need
Back what you took from me
You might also likeYou got the firewater runnin' through ya
You suckin' on it like it was a soother
Drinkin' to the one that got away
Bottlin' it up until you break
Fillin' me up like I'm a cup
Never enough, bottom is up
All rise to the remedy
The remedy
Just pour me another one
Somethin' to make me numb
Or make me too blind to see
See what you did to me
Just pour me another one
It's something I'm leanin' on
Don't get me wrong, I need
Back what you took from me
It's been so long
Since you've been gone
Can't feel my pain
I can't escape
Can't feel my legs
To walk away
Just pour me another one
Somethin' to make me numb
Or make me too blind to see
See what you did to me
Just pour me another one
It's something I'm leanin' on
Don't get me wrong, I need
Back what you took from me
You got the firewater runnin' through ya
The kind of remedy that will undo ya
