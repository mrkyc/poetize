This morning
So I could see you more clearly, my darling
But that's just one of the thirty thousands things
I do
To get a better look at you
I had somebody to come wash my windows
So I could watch you walking like the wind
Blows
I want to stop and ask you where you got
Them shoes
To get a better look at
Where you came from
Where you've been
The stars in your eyes
Tales you spin
The Frank Sinatra heroine
From songs you heard in Old Berlin
Oh, oh, oh
Let's be lovers and never go home
We'll live in the highlands and run with the wolves
Deep in the forest where nobody goes
No one would have us, we'll run with
The wolves
Singing, ah-ooh
Singing, ah-ooh
You might also likeAlthough I'll never know some things about
You
True love a mystery so I don't want to
And when I'm old I'll clean my glasses to
See through
To get a better look at
Smile lines around your eyes
You'll talk too loud, and then you'll shine
That dancey song that made you cry
The night you spent in Edelweiss
Oh, oh, oh
Let's be lovers and never go home
We'll live in the highlands and run with the wolves
Deep in the forest where nobody goes
No one would have us, we'll run with
The wolves
Singing, ah-ooh
Singing, ah-ooh
You got a way with words
Let's break away from the herd
And run away from the world
Away from it
Oh, oh, oh
Let's be lovers and never go home
We'll live in the highlands and run with the wolves
Deep in the forest where nobody goes
No one would have us, we'll run with
The wolves
Singing, ah-ooh
Singing, ah-ooh
Oh, oh, oh
Let's be lovers and never go home
We'll live in the highlands and run with the wolves
Deep in the forest where nobody goes
No one would have us, we'll run with
The wolves
Singing, ah-ooh
