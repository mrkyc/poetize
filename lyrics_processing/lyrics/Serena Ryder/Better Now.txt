You can't chase the darkness with a bright, bright light
'Cause the sunshine burns you up when you get too high
You can't cure loneliness with company
If you really knew yourself, you'd never get lonely

It's not a ride if you never get off
It's not a marathon if you run in a race that don't stop

I was killing the pain
The only way I knew how
But baby, I know better now
Oh, I loved you the way
The only way I knew how
But I can love you better now

We look so perfect from the outside in
But you can tear down those walls
You'd know they were paper-thin
If the weight's too heavy, let it break your heart
That's how you learn the art of falling apart

I was killing the pain
The only way I knew how
But baby, I know better now
Oh, I loved you the way
The only way I knew how
But I can love you better now
You might also like
I can love you better now
Let me love you better now
I can love you better now
Let me love you better now

It's not a party if it happens every day
It's not medicine if it just makes the symptoms go away

I was killing the pain
The only way I knew how
But baby, I know better now
Oh, I loved you the way
The only way I knew how
But I can love you better now

I can love you better now (Can't you feel the change?)
(I am not the same)
Let me love you better now (I am not the same)
(Can't you feel the change?)
I can love you better now (Can't you feel the change?)
(I am not the same)
