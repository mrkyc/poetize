I've been thinking about the first time we met
And I regret I made you my religion
Holding me like I was some kind of pet
You made me fetch, then said I was a vision

Funny thing about hindsight is that
There is no reset you see in perfect vision
Didn't know that I was fucked in the head
Until you said you're making me a mission

I rejoiced when the bright light, it came
At the end of the tunnel of chain

Watch me come alive, oh
Take me from the tide, oh
No longer your disciple
Watch me come alive, oh
Dying to survive, oh
Our spirit's in arrival
'Cause this is my revival
'Cause this is my revival
You might also like
Loving you was like an unholy hell
Under the spell of lies that you were preaching
Every time I looked into your eyes
The paradise, a crime you were deceiving

Now I'm never gonna bow down for you
I found the proof, the truth that you're a demon
Gotta a fire inside, mine to light
I'm taking back what right to your allegiance

I rejoiced when the bright light, it came
At the end of the tunnel of chain

Watch me come alive, oh
Take me from the tide, oh
No longer your disciple
Watch me come alive, oh
Dying to survive, oh
Our spirit's in arrival
'Cause this is my revival
'Cause this is my revival
I'm taking the high road
You're taking a seat
This love is survival
You're nothing to me
I'll follow the rhythm
I'll follow the beat
I'm feeling the fire
And I'm finally free

I rejoiced when the bright light, it came
At the end of the tunnel of chain

Watch me come alive, oh
Take me from the tide, oh
No longer your disciple
Watch me come alive, oh
Dying to survive, oh
Our spirit's in arrival
'Cause this is my revival
'Cause this is my revival
