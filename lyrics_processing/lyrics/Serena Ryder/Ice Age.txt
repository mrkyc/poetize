There was an empty space in the shadow beside you
I was just hanging out, I was floating like ghost do
I heard a distant voice but there was no conversation
I couldn't tune you out, I couldn't take the station

I was born to put my arms around you
Now that I finally found you, I'll never let you go
I was frozen in an ancient glacier
Until your human nature finally cracked the code

Now the Ice Age is over
Now the Ice Age is over
Feel the heat when I hold ya
Now the Ice Age is over

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The diagnosis read "I'll be clinically lonely"
And all he ever did, said "I never know peace"
And with the  days, you put me in my place
And when you count my fade, you took all my lonely
You might also like
I was born to put my arms around you
Now that I finally found you, I'll never let you go
I was frozen in an ancient glacier
Until your human nature finally cracked the code

Now the Ice Age is over
Now the Ice Age is over
Feel the heat when I hold ya
Now the Ice Age is over

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It was you, it was you
And you helped the space I fit into
It was you, it was you
And you came to bring me hope

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now the Ice Age is over
Now the Ice Age is over
Feel the heat when I hold ya
