You treated me bad
And you drove me crazy
It's 36 steps to the front door, baby
Step 29, gonna see what you done
But it's too late, too late
The changes are gonna come
You bought my love
You say you need my desire
You got a million dollars, but you still can't buy it
Step 29, and the end has begun
But it's too late, too late
Changes are gonna come

Love is blind, but now I see
I don't love you no more
I got 20/20

Got your number, got your number
Finally awaken from the spell I was under
Seen my lightning in my thunder
I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin' up
I got your number, got your number
Finally awaken from the spell I was under
Seen my lightning in my thunder
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got your number
You might also like
Got your number, got your number, number, number

5-3-4, double 6-4-7
Don't need it anymore
I delete it and forget it
I got pictures of us, worth a thousand words
But what can you say, say, I haven't already heard?
A lot of people say that one is a lonely number
But I'm skipping to the beat, and I'm the only drummer
Four to the floor, and I'm a perfect ten
I'm gonna shake it up, shake it up, shake it, I'll shake it up

Love is blind, but now I see
I don't love you no more
I got 20/20

Got your number, got your number
Finally awaken from the spell I was under
Seen my lightning in my thunder
I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin' up
I got your number, got your number
Finally awaken from the spell I was under
Seen my lightning in my thunder
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got your number
Got your number, got your number, number, number

Don't want a ring, ring
Don't got a ring, ring
I don't need you anymore, got everything-thing
Don't want a ring, ring
Don't got a ring, ring
I don't need you anymore, got everything-thing
Don't want a ring, ring (got your number, I got your number)
I don't need you anymore, got everything-thing
(Got your number, I got your number)

Got your number, got your number
Finally awaken from the spell I was under
Seen my lightning in my thunder
I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin', I'm wakin' up
I got your number, got your number
Finally awaken from the spell I was under
Seen my lightning in my thunder
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got your number

I'm a uptown baby with a downtown call
And all four aces and all four laws
In the north, in the south, in the east, in the west
In the 1-2-3-4 directions
There were 21 tears rolling down on my cheeks
And I'm gonna get where I'm going on my own two feet
I'm all four aces and talk is cheap
So baby read 'em, read 'em, read'em
