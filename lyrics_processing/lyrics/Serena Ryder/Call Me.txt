Made me a believer with all the things you do
Struck me with your arrow, pierced me through the heart
Should you ever miss me wherever you are
Anytime
Call me every night, call me every day
You don't need to have anything to say
Call me on the line, don't care what it's about
If you know I'm lying you can call me out
You dial my number, I (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You dial my number, I (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Seven six four three five whenever you call
You don't need a reason, no reason at all
Just to hear the whisper, just to hear your voice
Nothing to consider, love is not a choice
Not a choice
Call me every night, call me every day
You don't need to have anything to say
Call me on the line, don't care what it's about
If you know I'm lying you can call me out
You dial my number, I (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You dial my number, I (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You dial my number I, you dial my, you dial my
You dial my number I, you dial my, you dial my
You dial my number I, you dial my, you dial my
You dial my, you dial my, you dial my number
Call me every night, call me every day
You don't need to have anything to say
Call me on the line, don't care what it's about
If you know I'm lying you can call me out
You dial my number, I (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You dial my number, I (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
You dial my number, I (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
