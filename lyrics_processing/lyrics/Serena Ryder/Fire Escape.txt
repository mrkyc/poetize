Looking down from the fire escape
Eyes are locked, chips are lost
Tongues are tied and fingers' crossed
I wanted more than you could give
I gave you more than you could take
Taking us back to the glory days
Give me everything, give me poetry
Look me in the eyes when you're making love to me
Take me far away, back to where we came
To the day when we were standing on the fire escape
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
How's your heart, how's your day
All the words we never say
All the spaces between
What we say and what we mean
I wanted more than you could give
I gave you more than you could take
Taking us back to the glory days

Look me in the eyes when you're making love to me
Take me far away, back to where we came
To the day when we were standing on the fire escape
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Baby, just say the word
I think we're gonna make it heard
And we forget all the hurt, remember what we were
Baby, just say the word
I think we're gonna make it heard
And we can forget all the hurt and leave it in the dirt
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Baby, just say the word
I think we're gonna make it heard
And we forget all the hurt, remember what we were
Baby, just say the word
I think we're gonna make it heard
And we can forget all the hurt and leave it in the dirt
Give me everything, give me poetry
Look me in the eyes when you're making love to me
Take me far away, back to where we came
