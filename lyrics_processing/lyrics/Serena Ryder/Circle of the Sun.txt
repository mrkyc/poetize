And the things we cannot do
Look into the mirror and pretend you're me
And I'll pretend I am you
Take a little sunshine
Give a little teardrop
Everybody needs to love someone
Even in the silence
You can listen to the rhythm
And have a little dance around the circle of the sun
Even in the silence (Even in the silence)
You can listen to the rhythm (Listen to the rhythm)
Have a little dance around the circle of the sun
Dance around the circle of
Dance around the circle of
Dance around the circle of the sun
We've already got what we've been looking for
Yeah, we've already won the race
Don't overrate it, overcomplicate it
There's never been a better way
Take a little sunshine (Take a little sunshine)
Give a little teardrop (Give a little teardrop)
Everybody needs to love someone
Even in the silence (Even in the silence)
You can listen to the rhythm (You can listen to the rhythm)
And have a little dance around the circle of the sun
Light a fire when the sun goes down
Light a fire to see
Don't wait 'til the light goes out
Don't wait for me
Even in the silence (Even in the silence)
You can listen to the rhythm (Listen to the rhythm)
And have a little dance around the circle of the sun
Dance around the circle of
Dance around the circle of
Dance around the circle of the sun
Dance around the circle of
Dance around the circle of
Dance around the circle of the sun
Let's get away from who we think we are
And the things we cannot do
Even in the silence
(Dance around the circle of)
Even in the silence
(Dance around the circle of)
Even in the silence
(Dance around the circle of the sun)
Even in the silence, silence
Take a little sunshine
(Dance around the circle of)
Give a little teardrop
Everybody needs to love someone
(Dance around the circle of)
Even in the silence
(Dance around the circle of)
You can listen to the rhythm
And have a little dance around the circle of the sun
Take a little sunshine
(Dance around the circle of)
Give a little teardrop
Everybody needs to love someone
(Dance around the circle of)
Even in the silence
(Dance around the circle of)
You can listen to the rhythm
