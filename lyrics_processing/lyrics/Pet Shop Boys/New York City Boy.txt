New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

When you're a boy, some days are tough
Lying on your bed, playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp you gotta escape
Want to go and wander in the ticker-tape
You feel the deal is real, you're a New York City boy
So young, so run into New York City

New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

The street is amazing, the hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware at the latest deal
Hear a song that's the bomb!
If you don't get the mix
It's gone eighty-six
You feel the deal is real
You're in New York City
