Remember those days, the early nineties
We both applied for places at the same university
Ended up in London where we needed to be
To follow our obsession with the music scene

Wherever we went
Whatever we did
We knew the songs

They called us the pop kids
Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the pop kids
I loved you
I loved you
They called us the pop kids

I studied history while you did biology
To you the human body didn't hold any mystery
We were young but imagined we were so sophisticated
Telling everyone we knew that rock was overrated
See Pet Shop Boys LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also like
We stayed out 'til late
Five nights a week
And felt so chic

They called us the pop kids
Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the pop kids
I loved you
I loved you
They called us the pop kids
The pop kids
The pop kids
The pop kids
Remember those days?
Remember those days?
Remember those days?
Remember those days?
Remember those days?
Remember those days?
Remember those days?
Remember those days?
It was a wet Wednesday night
We worried that no one would be going out
How wrong we were
When we turned the corner there was already a queue stretching down the street
We swept straight in and you said

Oh, I like it here
Oh, I love it
Oh, I like it here
Oh, I love it
Oh, I like it here
Oh, I love it
Oh, I like it here
Oh, I am never going home
I loved you
They called us the pop kids
Cause we loved the pop hits
And quoted the best bits
So we were the pop kids
