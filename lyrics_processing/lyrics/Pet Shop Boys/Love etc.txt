You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more

Boy, it's tough getting on in the world
When the sun doesn't shine and a boy needs a girl
It's about getting out of a rut, you need luck
But you're stuck and you don't know how

(Don't have to be) A big bucks Hollywood star
(Don't have to drive) A super car to get far
(Don't have to live) A life of power and wealth
(Don't have to be) Beautiful but it helps
(Don't have to buy) A house in Beverly Hills
(Don't have to have) Your daddy paying the bills
(Don't have to live) A life of power and wealth
(Don't have to be) Beautiful but it helps

You need more
Than a big blank check to be a lover, or
A Gulfstream jet to fly you door to door
Somewhere chic on another shore
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need love

Too much of anything is never enough
Too much of everything is never enough

Boy, it's tough getting on in the world
When the sun doesn't shine and a boy needs a girl
It's about getting out of a rut, you need luck
But you're stuck and you don't know how

(Don't have to be) A big bucks Hollywood star
(Don't have to drive) A super car to get far
(Don't have to wear) A smile much colder than ice
(Don't have to be) Beautiful, but it's nice

You need more
Than the Gerhard Richter hanging on your wall
A chauffeur driven limousine on call
To drive your wife and lover to a white tie ball
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need more, you need more
You need love
I believe
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
That we can achieve
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
The love that we need
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
I believe
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
Call me naive
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
That love is for free
(You need more)
