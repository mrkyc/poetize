Sometimes you're better off dead
There's gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground to a dive bar
In a West End town

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End Boys and West End Girls
In a West End town, a dead end world

Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what?
How much have you got?
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
How much do you need?

You can find a place that no one knows
Where money talks and streets are gold
Someone stands in every door
And if they speak they break the law
Ask a question: blank faces
Read the news and turn the pages
Watch them play a different game
And no one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name

You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'til I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
How far have you been?
