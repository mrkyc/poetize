Sticks and stones built this house
These walls are getting so strong
Can't run me down, running 'round town
Singing that same old tired ass song
All the shots you throw, helped to pave my road
I refuse to buy your jewels
Knowing your gold is made for fools

Won't let y'all get into me (I'll never let my guard down)
Forcing your negative energies (Can't even let 'em get close)
I know you're wishing you see the enemy (I won't surrender)
I got a love for my enemies (Fuel my fire)

Go 'head and pour the gasoline on my name
I-I-I love it (Fuel my fire)
To me, it's just another log in the flame
I-I-I think I love it (Fuel my fire)
And I can always count on you, it's a guarantee
I-I-I love it (Fuel my fire)
My motivation, I get it from my enemies (Fuel my fire)

You don't know me (But you never try)
Defame me (And did it with a smile)
I don't mean with your corruption (Fuel my fire)
Go 'head and judge me, I know that you love me
You're stained with my name in your mouth (Mouth)
There's something about me that you can't take
You can't figure me out
You might also like
'Cause I'm the flame beneath the smoke (Smoke)
And soon enough, I'll rise above it all
You try to send me to an early grave
So you assassinate my name, but I won't fall for that

Go 'head and pour the gasoline on my name
I-I-I love it (Fuel my fire)
To me, it's just another log in the flame
I-I-I think I love it (Fuel my fire)
And I can always count on you, it's a guarantee
I-I-I love it (Fuel my fire)
My motivation, I get it from my enemies (Fuel my fire)

Did you ever think you'd break me down?
You just wanna see me burn
But I'll just light up the sky (You need to know)
This time I'll be stronger than ever
'Cause I've got too much to lose
The fight inside of me won't die
'Cause you fueled my fire (Whoa)

Go 'head and pour the gasoline on my name
I-I-I love it (Fuel my fire)
To me, it's just another log in the flame
I-I-I think I love it (Fuel my fire)
And I can always count on you, it's a guarantee
I-I-I love it (Fuel my fire)
My motivation, I get it from my enemies (My enemies)
(Fuel my fire)
Go 'head and pour the gasoline on my name
I think I love it, oh, I think I love it (Fuel my fire)
To me, it's just another log in the flame
I-I-I think I love it (Fuel my fire)
And I can always count on you, it's a guarantee
I-I-I love it (Fuel my fire)
