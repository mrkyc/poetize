Boy, drop the world
And love me now
Let's not wait for tomorrow
Take this moment
And let's own it
Let's build a day
In the sun's glow

And when the night falls
And darkness calls
All you gotta do is smile
Shine for me, boy

Come love me now (Like there'll never be another chance)
Come love me now (Like you're saving me the last dance)
Come love me now (Rock me slow like a baby)
Come love me now (I just need you to love me)
Come love me now (Like you'll never see my face again)
Come love me now (Like the whole world is ending)
Come love me now (Rock me slow like a baby)
Come love me now (I just need you to love me)

Boy, drop the world
And love me now
State your claim
'Cause I'm all yours
Let's pick a place
Anywhere on the go
And, baby, let's roll (Roll)
What you waiting for?
You might also like
'Cause destiny
Don't take rain checks
So love me now
With no regrets

Come love me now (Like there'll never be another chance)
Come love me now (Like you're saving me the last dance)
Come love me now (Rock me slow like a baby)
Come love me now (I just need you to love me)
Come love me now (Like you'll never see my face again)
Come love me now (Like the whole world is ending)
Come love me now (Rock me slow like a baby)
Come love me now (I just need you to love me)

Hurry up, boy, you're taking too long (You're taking too long)
Listen to the words of this song (To this song)
No more stalling, my heart's calling
Hear the urgency in this tone
Hurry up, boy, you're taking too long (Ooh, ooh)
Listen to the words in this song (Ooh, ooh)
No more stalling, my heart's calling
Hey
Come love me now (Like there'll never be another chance)
Come love me now (Like you're saving me the last dance)
Love me now (Rock me slow like a baby)
Come love me now (I just need you to love me)
Come on and love me (Like you'll never see my face again)
Yeah (Like the whole world is ending)
Rock me slow like a baby (Rock me slow like a baby)
I just need you to love me

Come love me
