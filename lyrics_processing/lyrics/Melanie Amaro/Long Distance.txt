Shadows on a ceiling
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Phone's about to die, boy
We should say goodbye, boy
Baby, I just want you to know

I hate the way I'm feeling
Talking to you ain't enough
I need you to touch me
Why you're so far from me?
Baby I've gotta let you know

And I just want you to be
More than a picture on my screen
I don't have a choice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
And I want you here with me
When I hear your answering machine
The sound of your voice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
Long distance love
You might also like
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Wherever you are now
I hope I'm what you're dreaming of
Counting down the seconds
'Til you're in my arms, boy
Baby, I've gotta let you know

And I just want you to be
More than a picture on my screen
I don't have a choice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
And I want you here with me
When I hear your answering machine
The sound of your voice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
Long distance love
Seems like the further you go now
The more that I want you close now
Tired of being alone now
Baby, when you're calling now
Ah, ah
Long distance!
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Long distance!

And I just want you to be
More than a picture on my screen
I don't have a choice
I can't live without you (I can't live, no)
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
And I want you here with me (I want you with me)
When I hear your answering machine (Answering machine)
The sound of your voice
I can't live without you (I can't)
I can't sleep at all (I won't)
And I'm crazy for you
Long distance love

Ah, ah
