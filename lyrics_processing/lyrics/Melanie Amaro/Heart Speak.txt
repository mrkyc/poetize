Ta-talking in heart speak
With you heartbeat
Ta-talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak
Can't speak

Would you like me to choose a life with you?
What if I told you that it's not so easy to do?

It's not up to me
It's out of my hands and I'm sure
It's not in my hands anymore
It's not up to me
I need it to breathe, so I must
Do everything that it wants
Speak to my heart, say what you want
Speak to my heart, plead for my love

Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak, can't speak
Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak, can't speak
You might also like
Could you ask it to see the good in you?
Look right through your scars and see everything that you are

It's not up to me
It's out of my hands and I'm sure
It's not in my hands anymore
It's not up to me
I need it to breathe, so I must
Do everything that it wants
Speak to my heart, say what you want
Speak to my heart, plead for my love

Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak, can't speak
Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak, can't speak

I can't understand a thing you say
But it's okay
Every heartache is helping me translate
The love that we've made
Speak to my heart, say what you want
Speak to my heart
Speak to my heart, say what you want
Speak to my heart, plead for my love

Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Talking in heart speak (Talking in heart speak)
Talking in heart speak, can't speak
Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak, can't speak
Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak, can't speak
Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak, can't speak

Ta-talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak
Talking in heart speak, can't speak
Hear it and speak with your heartbeat
Ta-talking in heart speak
