Luda
Now I may not be the worst or the best
But you gotta respect my honesty
And I may break your heart
But I don't really think there's anybody as bomb as me
So you can take this chance in the end
Everybody's gonna be wonderin' how you deal
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel

Uh, now listen to me, baby (Oh, oh, oh)
Before I love and leave you (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
They call me heartbreaker (Oh, oh, oh)
I don't wanna deceive you (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

There's no point tryna hide it (Oh, oh, oh)
No point tryna evade it (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know I got a problem (Oh, oh, oh)
Problem with misbehavin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
(That's all I'm gonna do, woman)

Listen, now I'm only gonna break your heart
And shatter and splatter it all into little itty-bitty pieces
Whether or not you get it all together
Then it's finders, keepers, and losers weepers
See, I'm not tryin' to lead you on
No, I'm only tryin' to keep it real
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel
Ayy, and I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold
Ayy, like a big bad wolf, I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
Ayy, if you fall for me, I'm only gonna tear you apart
Ayy, told you from the start, ayy

I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
