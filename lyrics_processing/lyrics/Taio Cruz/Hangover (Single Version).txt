I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, k-keep, keep it going, going, going, going


I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted (Yeah-yeah)
I got a little bit mashed last night, night
I got a little shit-faceted (Yeah-yeah)

Well, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna roll, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
If you don't know, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Well, now you know, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, k-keep, keep it going, come on
