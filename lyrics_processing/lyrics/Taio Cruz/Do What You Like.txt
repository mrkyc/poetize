Girl, why you gotta be so cruel?
Why you gotta be so special?
Heaven ain't got nothin' on you
Got me feelin' like a horny devil

We keep on going, keep on going 'til our hearts burn out
And we can keep on going 'til the lights burn out
And no one needs to know what we are all about
What we are all about

So get up off that sexy round thing and
Move your body, and do what you like
Keep it going if it feels alright
Move your body, and do what you like
Keep it going if it feels alright
(Keep on rockin' with me) Get down
(Love it when you rockin' with me) Do what you like
(Keep on rockin' with me) Get down, get down, do what you like
(Keep on rockin' with me) Get down
(Love it when you rockin' with me) Do what you like
(Keep on rockin' with me) Get down

Girl, why you gotta be so bad?
Why you gotta be my guilty pleasure?
It's like you got your feet up on the dash
It's like I got my foot down on the pedal
You might also like
We keep on going, keep on going 'til our hearts burn out
And we can keep on going 'til the lights burn out
And no one needs to know what we are all about
What we are all about

So get up off that sexy round thing and
Move your body, and do what you like
Keep it going if it feels alright
Move your body, and do what you like
Keep it going if it feels alright
(Keep on rockin' with me) Get down
(Love it when you rockin' with me) Do what you like
(Keep on rockin' with me) Get down, get down, do what you like
(Keep on rockin' with me) Get down
(Love it when you rockin' with me) Do what you like
(Keep on rockin' with me) Get down

So get up off that sexy round thing and
