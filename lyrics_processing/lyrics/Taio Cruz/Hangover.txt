I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, k-keep, keep it going, going, going, going


I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted (Yeah-yeah)
I got a little bit mashed last night, night
I got a little shit-faceted (Yeah-yeah)

Well, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna roll, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
If you don't know, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Well, now you know, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I got an empty cup, pour me some more
So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, k-keep, keep it going, come on

Drink up 'cause a party ain't a party 'til you ride out through it
End up on the floor but can't remember, you clueless
Officer like "What the hell is you doing?"
Stumbling, fumbling, you wanna what, come again
Give me Henn, give me gin, give me liquor
Give me champagne bubbles 'til I'm bent
What happens after that?, If you inspired, then tell a friend
Like, oh, my homie Taio, we can all sip again
Get it in and again and again, leave evidence
Wasted, so what, Irrelevant
Beer keg to the head, who's selling it
I got a hangover, that's my medicine
Don't mean to brag or sound too intelligent
A little Jack can't hurt this veteran
I show up but I never throw up
So let the drinks pour up, pour up

I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, woah-oh-oh
