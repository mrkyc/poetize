I saw when you arrived looking like a supermodel
Your ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle
I love the way you ride, put that thing on full throttle
So get, get get get up on the saddle

I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner, she can be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin to hide it, girl you a troublemaker
And I'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker

I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
And sing out oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa

Sexy little mama, it's really nice to meet you
Can I be in your classroom and be your private teacher
If I bring out my camera, will you be in my feature
Cause we gon' do some things
Hope your daddy ain't a preacher

I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica
Pretend that i am dinner you can be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin to hide it girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker
You might also like
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing it oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa

I love the way you dance, oh it makes me crazy
I wanna see you move, so just let it go baby
I feel like we can do this if you wanna go with it
Let's take it to the top, p-p-push it to the limit
Take it to the top, p-p-push it to the limit, to the limit, to the limit, to the limit, limit, limit, limit...

I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
And sing out
Oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea
Oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea
