I could dream of ways to see you
I could close my eyes to dream
I could fantasize about you
Tell the world what I believe
But whenever I'm not with you
It's so hard for me to see
I need to see a picture of you
A special picture just for me, yeah

So take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Take a dirty picture for me
Take a dirty picture
Send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Send a dirty picture to me
Send a dirty picture
Picture, picture, picture, picture
