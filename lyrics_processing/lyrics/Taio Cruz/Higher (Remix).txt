Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh

Now I know how to get down on the floor (Floor)
Experienced in moves you can't ignore ('Nore)
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked (Hooked)
Come over here and take a closer look (Look)

'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now (Ha, ha, let's go)

It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
You might also like
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill (Thrill)
I got this high without takin' a pill (Pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun (Sun)
I'm dancin' like I am the only one (One)

'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

It's taking me higher, higher (Yeah)
Higher off the ground (Let's go)
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh

I got my feet in the air and my head on the ground
And the rest of my body somewhere in the clouds
I'm coming down no time soon
Like I'm tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like I'ma be up for a minute (Uh-huh)
Such a beautiful feeling, 'idn't it?
Yup, when your body is so plateau
On a level that just feels so infinite
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh (It's your boy Travie McCoy)
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
