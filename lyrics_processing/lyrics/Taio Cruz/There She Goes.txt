There she goes, looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes, like a shooting star
Make you wanna play, makes all the boys them say
RedOne, Taio Cruz, Mr. Worldwide

Yeah, the way her body moving like a hurricane
Thought I knew what sexy was
But uh, uh, that just changed
She's a pop star, rock star (La la hey hey hey hey hey)
Fighter, lover (La la hey hey)
She knows exactly what she's doing
I think she's a pro, when she's walking to the room
She make sure that she know
She's a thriller, killer (La la hey hey hey hey hey)
Dance floor filler (La la hey hey)

There she goes, looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes, like a shooting star
Make you wanna play, makes all the boys them say

And make you scream and shout
She'd like to chew you up
And then she'll spit you out
She's a pop star, rock star (La la hey hey hey hey hey)
Fighter, lover (La la hey hey)
No don't think that girl a lighter
She don't give a what (What)
Yeah, she likes to play with fire and she burns it up (It up)
She's a thriller, killer (La la hey hey hey hey hey)
Dancefloor, filler (La la hey hey)

You know the rule of the game
Mo money, mo leeches
And they'll rob you like Pharaohs in Egypt
These boys done paraplegic
'Cause they don't know, Pit is very prestigious
Me and this woman got telekinesis, I just look and they go
Look at them move, Look at them shake
Look at they features, beautiful creatures
And make love to them on beautiful beaches
I'm ready for the world, but the world ain't ready for me
Patience is a virtue, wait and see
Don't believe?
Ay baby, Ven pa darte coquita en tu ke ke, haha
Don't you act like you don't know what I'm talking about
And your friends, who cares what they talking about
She can play goalie, but with a little bit of Voli
She gonna let me score, fo sho (Dale)

There she goes, looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes, like a shooting star
Make you wanna play, makes all the boys them say
