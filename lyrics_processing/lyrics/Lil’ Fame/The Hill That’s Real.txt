I'm on the hill where the shit is real
You would suppose it's all about money, hoes, and clothes
Territories in the smash like a crash from blasting
It's all about sex and a sass assassins
It always gotta be a flick up
The cops making a pickup
Or niggas getting money from a stickup
Lost boys running around like a mad man
Killing, or either getting killed from a bad plan
One shorty had got his life tooken
From a sound like this, you know it gotta be in Brooklyn
They take it off as if they gotta start street
That's why the brothers on the Hill will bust a nigga in a heartbeat
Yo, everybody want to live long
So you bust another brother for looking in your fucking face for 'im
I gotta live it, plus roll with a temper
Cause niggas go out the same way they get ya
Every other day, somebody gets born
And the niggas on the corner playing the wall like handball
The only one remain in a bad game
Life's a pain; niggas retire from the knuckle game
Some niggas are killers when you drink Baccardi
But when they sober, they wouldn't bust a balloon at a birthday party
It's easy to tell what type of shit sells
From the streets of the hometown
I'm pushing a Beemer, smoking a fat ounce
I'm from the Hill where the motherfuckers are buck wild
Niggas catching bodies most of the time beating trial
Like the Island, cocksuckers'll get touched
Niggas want beef, but hold a grudge like a clutch
Niggas on the deep dirty pack guns
Cause up on the real Hill, it's blow holes, money, no fair ones
I'm on my own cause my name's in a box
Only in jail, they playing for keeps up on the Hill
That's real
You might also like
Niggas get slayed on the regular
Fuck the crack game, now funeral homes getting paid
No time for niggas doing something for nothing
And it's hectic, so now I pack a burner like I'm going hunting
I feel on the Hill in the 'ville, niggas build as they deal
But to make the bill, they gotta kill
Niggas'll murder another nigga and cold jet
Then come back in five minutes to the scene of the set
I seen cops playing niggas like they was suckers
Niggas started flipping, bringing the ruckus to the motherfuckers
Punk-ass cops are faggots
Cops try to knock niggas, niggas be dropping cops like a bad habit
A little shorty was a beggar
But he saved and went abroad and did a job from a bootlegger
He got props from the boys and he pulled the girls
With two shots, little shorty thought he ruled the world
The shit he had, he was too rough with it
Little shorty had a heart like his name was David Berkowitz
The type of little motherfucker with a hard figure
New school shorty jibed with the wrong niggas
He harassed the wrong niggas for cash
And I ain't trying to get brass
But I'mma put shit in a smash
Let his little ass know I'm playing for keeps
And that's to kill
Up on the Hill that's real
Niggas are S.T.D. -- scared to death
Shorty was a vet, and a threat
Handed him beef like a chef
Straight up and down, the shorty was a strong nigga
Yep, he was, but shorty fucked with the wrong nigga
He stuck a nigga for his jewels
And the ghetto with two shots
Niggas are packing 16 shots or better
He said, "Your money, run your jewels and cash"
He said no one gon' get hurt, it was a little nigga blast
He bust his only two shots and didn't hit
Money bust back and let off a whole clip
Shorty ran and stopped and dropped
Here comes the cops -- they found his ass in a lot
Shorty died because another nigga struck
Niggas ain't joking -- you play pussy, you get fucked
Shit is ill so I chill and do things on how I feel
