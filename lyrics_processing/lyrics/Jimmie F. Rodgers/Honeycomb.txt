Well, it's a darn good life, and it's kinda funny
How the Lord made the bee, and the bee made the honey
And the honeybee lookin' for a home
And they called it a honeycomb
And they roamed the world, and they gathered all
Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
And the honeycomb from a million trips
Made my baby's lips

So, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby?
Well, Honeycomb, be my own
Got a hank o' hair and a piece of' bone
They made a walkin', talkin' Honeycomb
Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby?
Well, Honeycomb, be my own
What a darn good life when you got a wife
Like Honeycomb

And the Lord said now that I made a bee
I'm gonna look all around for a green, green tree
And He made a little tree, and I guess you heard
What then?  Well, He made a little bird
And they waited all around until the end of spring
Gettin' every note that the birdie'd sing
And they put 'em all into one sweet tome
For my Honeycomb

Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby?
Well, Honeycomb, be my own
Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
They made a walkin', talkin' Honeycomb
Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby
Well, Honeycomb, be my own
What a darn good life when you got a wife
Like Honeycomb

And the Lord says, "Now, that I made a bird
I'm gonna look all round for a little ol' word
That sounds about sweet like 'turtledove'
And I guess I'm gonna call it 'love'"
And He roamed the world lookin' everywhere
Gettin' love from here, love from there
And He put it all in a little ol' part
Of my baby's heart
Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby?
Well, Honeycomb, be my own
Got a hank o' hair and a piece of bone
They made a walkin', talkin' Honeycomb
Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby
Well, Honeycomb, be my own
What a darn good life when you got a wife
Like Honeycomb
