To come over in the wee hours of the mornin'
I said I could not let the sunrise catch me sleepin'
And that is why I've givin' you fair warnin'
And though you might have loved me like I never ever have been
Loved before your front door is open
And I've got to keep on movin'
So I will stay with you a while and then I'll
Let my hitch hike thumb take me to where I wanna
Because I've got to keep on searchin' for the dream that I've been seekin'
Since I left my home in Oklahoma
And who's to say but that I might not be back tomorrow
If I find there's only sorrow you may see me from your windowsill
Next mornin'
I'm a drifter and I've seen the rain
I'm a drifter and I've felt the pain, the pain that comes with loneliness
So I drift from town to town searchin' all around
Lookin for the answer to my sorrow
And if the answer is you then I'll be back tomorrow
You might also likeLets make the most of time before the break of day
But don't try to make me stay if I don't want to
Because I've got to keep on searchin' for that dream
And you can't bind me with the simple words I love you
But if I realize the dream that I've been searchin' for
Is waitin' here behind your door
Then I'll come back to stay if you still want me to
I'm a drifter and I've seen the rain
I'm a drifter and I've felt the pain the pain that comes with loneliness
So I drift from town to town searchin' all around
Lookin for the answer to my sorrow
And if the answer is you then I'll be back tomorrow
I'm a drifter and I've seen the rain
I'm a drifter and I've felt the pain the pain that comes with loneliness
So I drift from town to town searchin' all around
Lookin for the answer to my sorrow
And if the answer is you then I'll be back tomorrow
