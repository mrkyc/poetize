But the thoughta dyin' without tellin' my baby good-bye
Explainin' why, Daddy had to go
Believin' that's the only way she'd ever really know
I wish I could stay with you
See you graduate school
Grow old 'n' gray wit' you
See your babies 'n' their babies too
Baby you the only proof I ever existed
'N' there was nothin' more addictive
Than your hugs 'n' your kisses
You know how much I'm gonna miss this
I wish this bliss could be endless
But that's just senseless
It seems as though this is the business
Daddy was a leader 'n' people followed
I stay so caught up in the game, I seldom see tomorrow
A desperado, who changed diapers 'n' warmed bottles
Perhaps I could of been a more positive role model
But DooWop I'll always love you
Don't let nobody tell you
Your pops wasn't no good dude, Naw Boo

If the sun comes up
'N' I'm not home
Be strong
There's a life inside you
Do your best to, carry on
Tell the kids about me
When there old enough to, understand
Tell them that there daddy was, a good man
A good man...
You might also likeI don't know where your head was when you
Just said "Forget us," then you
Took my baby, home to your mamas house
Can't even cry no mo', 'sect the fact it's over now
I'll I can do is thank God you a good mama
Apologize 'cuz I put you through so much drama
But I already give you half my doe
You should have to write half my flows
'N' do half my shows
I keep the lights on
I bring the bacon home
Count the contractions
Cut the cord
Bring the baby home
Three and a half karats
'N' if you except my proposal
I'll be that person you been searchin'
And the whole pursuit is over
I got a show outta town
Get my doe outta pounds
Rock my baby till she fall asleep
Take her and lay her down
Tell her mama I'm goin'
'N' go and sing songs
The sun come up 'n' I'm not home
Somethin' musta went wrong
So be strong
This is for the good men
That went to die in Iraq
My drug lord veterans
That died over crack
Convenience store clerks that get killed for nothin' more
Than the measly contents of a register drawer
I work to feed my seed
Protect my offspring
I stand here between nothin' an' everything
On the verge of failure and success
But I have done you an injustice
If I don't do my best
Daddies don't get to rest
Daddies just gotta work
If my back begins to ache
I guess it's just gonna have to hurt
Cuz daddies gonna make it through the work day
Just so I can be a hero on your birthday
I believe the worst days almost over
In case I never told you baby, you my little solider
Damn girl so cute, so strong, so smart, so free
So hard headed, yo lil' ass's just like me, Uhn
