When you least expect it
But if you love them, and they love you the same way, believe they got they're eyes on you right now
Baby

Sail on across the sky I see you on the other side you helped me so much, I'm much obliged I never got to thank you
Sail on across the sky I soldier up and dry my eyes I wish that I had got to hold you, but I'm just glad that I got to know you
G hit me on the nextel chirp and he told me "big homie don't repeat these words but I just heard this 'bout the B-I-G and I can't get ahold of Jelly."
Damn
I'm the one that made them phone calls dreaden' havin' tah talk to my road dog
I'm the one that went and beat on his front door
The look on my face kinda described what I came for
Tried to keep him focused when he was ready to go to war
But then again, ain't that what friends are really for?
Biggie, I know we never was that close, but I can't describe the impact it had on Road
I did a show with lil' dude just the other night, he made everybody in that bitch be quiet and have a moment of silence like real G's do
Lighters up, in memory of you big homie

I can still see us at the red light, homes
Customized whips with the headlights on
Boxes bangin' them old gangsta songs, everybody tryin' tah figure out what went wrong
I done seen every one of my people hurt
Been there when my homeboy was 'bout to go berserk
Been that dude, myself
I done carried the casket, had to look at my homeboy after he got blasted
Nothin's guaranteed, take advantage of today, cause you never know when your life will be taken away
You might also likeAnd when I go, just let me slide across the sky
Because you gotta know, baby, even bosses die
Just imagine me on streets of gold, ridin' chrome
Think of it like this: daddy called me home
I ain't gone, I'm right here you just can't see me
But we can still talk, why you think I made them CD's?
I'm as free as a bird, now
And this bird you cannot change
Who'd have thought you'd see me in ICU?
Prob'ly thought I'd see you in ICU
You can't see me, but I see you
Wish you could hear me sayin' "Baby, just be cool."
I know it's gon' be hard without me there
You can make it, baby, just hold me down
I'm on the other side, where it's all clearer
Don't feel sorry for me, feel sorry for my pall bearer
It's gon' take a dozen people just to tote your homie to the hole
Quit all that cryin' and holdin' on, go on let me go
This ain't the first time we done been through this together
I know you didn't think I'll be here forever
Tomorrow's not promised, I took advantage of the moment
I never was happy here, yeah, and you know this
I was discontent like an instrument that had no one to play it, you know what I'm sayin'
