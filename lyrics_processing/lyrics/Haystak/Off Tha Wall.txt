(verse1)
Uh..Fire in da hole fuk urself
Blew da whole house up cookin meth
Wer we at boy shulda hookd a left
Now we ridin through da suburbs scared ta death
Cause I ain't got no business bein ovr here
Police behind me wit a open beer
Blu lights in da rear view mirror
I know yall ain't from round here
Down deep off in dat dirty man
Good people do dirty thangs
Hard to be clean in a dirty game
So u do u an i'll do da same
Gainst da grain
Way I came
Whole lot a good people did da same
Mouths ta feed...kids ta raise
Sum a yall ain't got sh*t ta say
But i'll flip da flava,snap one day
An i'll hola at yall lik wat u say bra
Twelve a stress i got dressed
Came to da thang to drank some dranks
Think i might end up in a argument
Smack dab in da middle of a incident
But wen ol'boy got up off of that cement
He look lik jus ben in accident
You might also like(hook)x2
Lil sumthin i wrote wen i was off da
Wall
All yall...holes in da wall
They all... fuk the law
Grab a broad
Fill ur cup wit alcohol
(verse2)
Ham bone,ham bone wer u ben
Around da blok and piggybak again
Crops ain't ready ta...cut yet
Fuk dat we gonna drop cassettes
Put it on da market,hot sh*t
If u ain't got it cop it
I spit...ridiculously
Ain't no other rappers is fukin wit me
Hey, usin' big words
Big nouns
Big verbs
Big adjectives
Bit*h get it how u liv
Talk sh*t till i find ur crib
Hide da kids
All is fair in love and war
Mothafukers dont giv a fuk no more
My baby dont stay at 1304
Think i ain't got tha mac11 no more
But com on in
But wen u com in da den
Im puttin 1 in ur chin
Then 1 in ur friend
And wen tha mothafukers finally let me outa da pen
I bet u bitches nevr evr try to get me again
(hook)x2
(verse3)
Two things i learned since i started
Two kinds of work good and garbage
Two kinds of coke
The kind u shoot
And the kind u smoke
The kind that dissolves
And the kind that float
But it all comes in on banana boats no it dont
Gets hauled through the jungle goats and mules
You ain't payin' for the dope, just the boat and fuel
The disstance between the connectin u
And if u liv up north the best thang to do
Com down south...work somthin out
Go bak home and start frontin em out
Cash clients get a nice surprise
But watch da mothafukers cause they might be vice
Get up in da mornin... go to work
Try to look as though u dont do dirt
Stay low-pro and u won't get hurt
Keep the connect tapped
And u won't get murked
U ain't gotta wear diamonds all da time
Da*n dogg u ain't Busta Rhymes
That shinin dont mak any sense
U idiot
U ain't legitimate
U an advertisement for a drug indictment
Runnin round here lik u outa ur mind
Sombody gonna drop dime
Jus a matter of time
Watch wat i tell ya
