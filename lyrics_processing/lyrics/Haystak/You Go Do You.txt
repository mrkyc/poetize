My grandmama now she woulda called it Indian givin'
Either way, you tickle me
You can do better
Ain't that what you keep telling yourself
And it was cool 'til you said that to someone else
It went from person a to person B
Person B to person C
Person D and that's who told me
I'm sure after it came through the grapevine
It sounded 8 times worse than when you said it at first
I don't even wanna hear your version
Go do some soul searching
Cause obviously we both with the wrong person
Just know this
I know I made some mistakes
It was over when I let us stop communicatin'
This relationship so full of technicality and complication
When the last time we had a conversation
Just the occasional good movie and some grunge for sex
All we got to look forward to
Girl whats next?
We still cool though
You can call me any day
Honestly I was looking for a way out anyway (but hey)
You might also likeYou go do your thing
I'ma do mine
I really hope things work out fine
I hope you succeed
I hope you achieve and have everything you was tryna have with me
(Repeat 1x:)
At this point I feel like taking you back
But literally be somethin' like sleepin' with the enemy
You throwin' up the fact that you've forgiven me
I never once publisized the business of this family
I be over at buns house
Watchin' re-runs of Run's house
Go on and call your lawyer
Cause I'm thinkin' this is done now
Somehow, I'll find the strength within me
To rebuild what we destroyed
I hope that you enjoy
Sleepin' in our bed minus me
You finally free, and hey that's what you wanted right
A grown woman scared of things that go bump in the night
Tryn'a replace me with a nightlight, yeah right
It's like replacing a grizzly bear with a 3 legged cat
You would think of some old dumb mess like that
I be over there at night
To bring you some chrome
I don't like you bein' there alone
But that's not my home
You go do your thing
I'ma do mine
I really hope things work out fine
I hope you succeed
I hope you achieve and have everything you was tryna have with me
(Repeat 1x:)
I remember romance
Buildin' snowman and holdin' hands
I thought you would be wit me when I was a old man
I think of better days fireplaces getaways
When I love you was more than just a habitual phrase
I gaze in the photo
Searchin' for feelings that don't live here no more
You swore to keep it 100
Nothin' could come between us
We should'a tried to talk
Perhaps we could'a reasoned
Shoulda, woulda, coulda
I'm thinkin' this is over now
We're broken down to a (?) compound
I messed up and I'm not blamin' this all on you
But there's certain things you don't do
And you did that
And I'm like babygirl you can't do that
Now the last thing on my mind is where you at
I remember good times and happiness
But I also remember exactly how it came to this
Now look here
You go do your thing
I'ma do mine
I really hope things work out fine
I hope you succeed
I hope you achieve and have everything you was tryna have with me
(Repeat 1x:)
Get on girl
Get on get on
(Repeat 3x:)
