Just wanna spend, the rest of my, life with you
Be your Bonnie be my Clyde, make these cowards run and hide
And I, just wanna spend, the rest of my, life with you
Through the good times and bad, boyfriend girlfriend mom and dad
Whatever
Verse 1:
I search for a chick like me who blows dro
Cause she can appreciate how that sticky burns so slow
You know, a young chick with an old soul
Set through the fire, just to hold hands while the coals glow
I'll build a house around her, we could fill it with seeds
And be like, Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden
We can grow old, watch it rain and snow
And see the sun rise and fall over yonder no
And when the coals burn out, cause one of us is gone
And the other is broken hearted, left to live life alone
You used to, listen to me complain about my real bad days
Rub my, back and my neck, and make it all go away
Always there with an encouraging word, I couldn't imagine
Having to be here without her, and I'm so scared of losing you
She'd say boo boo, I'm never gonna leave you
And then she sang to me

Verse 2:
Lil' mama your eyes, the candle light magnifies
Hazel turned grey, than bluer than a summer day
Baby wanna run away, far away to some other place
Where we can lay, tangled in one anothers embrace
By the fire place, 'till we're old and grey
From, roca wear, to rockin' chairs, whatever you need
Just call and I'mma be there, wasn't prepared to lose you
It hurt me so, you were addictive, and letting you go, was no
Walk through the park, I remember nights that I sat there in the dark
Pistol beside me, ready to use it writing a will in a
Book where I had once wrote music, and then I remember
Somethin' you once said, layin' next to me, naked breathin' heavy in the bed
You said
Chorus:
Just wanna spend, the rest of my, life with you
Be your Bonnie be my Clyde, make these cowards run and hide
And I, just wanna spend, the rest of my, life with you
Through the good times and bad, boyfriend girlfriend mom and dad
Whatever
Verse 3:
Police pull us over, I'm squeaky clean haha, 28 grams in your bra, while I
Blaze the haze as we rode off, how could you be so hard and still so soft
All the nights we used to ride, held my tone
Got my name tatted right above your pelvic bone
My luck uh, middle soprano, all of my heart
Homicide detectives have to pry us apart
The way that we did, just a few short months
After makin' a kid, does your new man, do it like that
Candle wax, down the small of your back, does he
Bite your neck, does he nibble on your collar bone
Do you still think about me when you're all alone
Used to grab you and hold you tight
The heat'll be back on tomorrow but it's cold tonight
Chorus:
Just wanna spend, the rest of my, life with you
Be your Bonnie be my Clyde, make these cowards run and hide
And I, just wanna spend, the rest of my, life with you
Through the good times and bad, boyfriend girlfriend mom and dad
