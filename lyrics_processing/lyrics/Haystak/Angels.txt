"Check" "Check"
If I do not make it back to the comfort of
My house, understand that was Gods will 'n'
I've only lived this long because...

I've got angels lookin' over me
Protectin' me
From people who wish death on me
I've got tensions
They constantly stressin' me
People who'd love to see me restin' in peace
But they don't matter, Naw...
I've got angels lookin' over me
Protectin' me
From people who wish death on me
I've got tensions
They constantly stressin' me
People who'd love to see me restin' in peace
But they don't matter, Naw...
I've felt 'em around me since I was a kid
I often wonder exactly who it is...
Is it Ernie, is it Ian, is it BoeBoe, is it Nate
Is it, Kevin, is it Chapman, Is it Rog, is it Jay
Is it pa, is it pops, is it pappy, is it mammy
Is it someone from my crew, or someone from my family
All I know is I wouldn't have made it this far
Without those shining stars, 'n' I know who they are
What they represents my people who passed on
Five years, it don't even seem that long
We made it baby
I wish you was here with me
Standin' on stage with me,'n' blowin' this haze with me
But it can't be so I accept that, move forward
To tomorrow, long live the desperado
The big homie, the one that held it down
Even though you underground, I can feel you above me
Your like...
You might also like
Understand I've been blessed with the serenity
To accept what I can't change 'bout my enemies
But the devil tries to corrupt me
I ain't no psycho, but don't push me
Was we, trapped in a world we thought we'd wake up from
It seems like a dream, but it seems so real
Was it those pills, was it those drinks
Was it that weed, was it just me
Is this reality, that is what we goin' through
What you call overnight, we call overdue
Easy way up boy, if you only knew
I came up fucked up, from the same place as you
Where bullets fly, 'N' people die
Ambulances leave without 'em, Coroners pick 'em up
You can buy the paper 'n' read about 'em
Flip to the sports page, 'n' never even think about 'em
Other people find it hard to live without 'em, Uhn..

I'm the desperate souls
Of a thousand old
MC's who never had an album
Go, gold or platinum
They just rap for them, Fans
That know the song like the back of their han's
The ones that put Stak in demand
Know that I'll never forget y'all
Wouldn't be shit without y'all
Now y'all say you the one that held me down
Broke like a mother fucker underground
Demo tapes, payin' dues
Baby food, baby shoes
Only way I made it way by the grace of God
So God bless my family and God bless my squad
We can't take no more loses, Nah
Lose no more bosses, Nah
What's this I hear about some fallin' off shit
You think I'm really gonna retire
I'm gonna let you wonder
Until then just keep wishin' for incarceration or murder
But I've got a presents around, that's why I don't wear a vest
Not to mention, henchmen do not aim at your chest
Death is inevitable, something you can't run from
I'll come back 'n' look over some ye', some
What...
