Ah co- ah co-, ah come on
You are not the only one
Going thru what your going thru, you know what I'm saying?

Ah come on, ah come on
I don't give a fuck what position you find yourself in
Just find security knowing somewhere else
Someone else is going through the same struggles you are right now
And it's probably me

I remember December, middle of a bitter winter
Ass on the trunk, feet swinging by the fenders
Arguing with you in the freezing cold
I was wrong, but you ain't have to leave me though
Out here, fucked up, all alone
And what I really wanna say is come on, come home
But I got this load on me
Couldn't be worse than my mama died or my main homie told on me
Hold me grand mama, standing in front of her house
Tears trickle on my cheek, down onto her blouse
And I realize now, that once she's gone
I'm a truly know the meaning ah being alone when I'm

All alone, I don't even care which way I go
I'm just following my radio (Rollin')
All alone, I don't even care which way I go
I'm just following my radio

What's up to all my home girls?
Caught up in this world
Preoccupied with money and sex, powder and x
Little mamma I promise, it's not the solution
I'm aware that your lifestyle is full of confusion
I saw you at my show, I had no time to talk
So close your eyes and imagine we were taking a walk
Compliment you on your beauty, your handsome behind
But at the same time, tell ya God gave you a mind
And you should put it to use, go back to school
So you can have something, with or without these fools
Don't let no dude beat you, mistreat you
You deserve to be loved, I understand you attracted to thugs
Pick a real motherfucker that's gonna treat you well
Not no dead beat staying in and out of jail
It's hard when you out here alone and cold
That's the shit that make a stripper chick work that pole 'cause she's

All alone, I don't even care which way I go
I'm just following my radio (Rollin')
All alone, I don't even care which way I go
I'm just following my radio
We don't die, we multiply
Alcoholics preoccupied with being high
A workaholic who had seldom if ever rested
A damn fool for letting Cathy leave, I contested
Every convicted felon that had ever been arrested
Every quiet child that had ever been molested
Every struggling rapper that had ever made a record
Every average cat that ever came in second
A proud father changed diapers and warmed bottles
Made an honest living and now I'm a role model?
A good dude for your son or daughter to look up to
Be here when the world got 'em feeling like fuck you
Help them see better days and overcome obstacles
They go to school and hurt somebody, I'm a feel responsible
Something I could've said, something I could've did
To get to them kids, I know they felt like they were just

All alone, I don't even care which way I go
I'm just following my radio (Rollin')
All alone, I don't even care which way I go
