Like this, here I say...."

Imagine me in a SUV
Sports utility, them boys from Tennessee
Ooh-ee the stee-lo, they know
Tennessee tags on the back of the Durango
Ain't no players like down south players
Them boys there do come clean, I swear
Can't every click duck crew
Do as we do
(I'm bout to starve) Me too
Let's get the seafood
(whistles)
All up in Red Lobster
Hey girl, you got a table for 20 players and mobsters?
Rollie's glisten, diamonds gleamin
Beepers beepin, cell phones ringin
(Hold up) This Haystak
(What you doin' later on?)
Come to the spot I'm droppin' the lyrics on this new song
(How's it go?)
It goes
(HOOK)
Down South Players (Gettin' payed in the game)
Down South Players (Wearin' suede in the rain)
Down South Players (Do the craziest things)
Down South Players (Go by alias names)
Down South Players (Gettin' payed in the game)
Down South Players (Be wearin' suede in the rain)
Down South Players (Do the craziest things)
Down South Players - Play on!
You might also like
Ooh-ah, it's about that time
That I blaze a dime and pass it, write a rhyme
Perhaps I'll finish the one I was workin on a few days ago
Maybe they'll show me love and bump it on the radio
Here it go-go-goes
(Think I'm playin around?)
Hit the studio
(And start layin it down)
You see us down south players, we don't mess around
Whether we iced out, Dickied down
(In and out of town)
To this game I'm not new
Karl Kani to FUBU
Every fool in my crew
Done did they share of doo-doo
Man the south is cuckoo
These fools are trying to shoot you
Pistols be like (woah-woah)
Bullets be like (toe to toe)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, where'd a white boy come from?
In the top 20 throwin low blows at dum-dums
My check comes in lump sums
My name's found in chump's guns
You want some, come get some
Yo Dan, drop them damn drums!
(HOOK)

Down south players handle big money business
Can't you see the 20 inches while we gleamin' on y'all (gleam)
See, we gon' ball
Drop CD's like rainfall
Cut through suckers like chainsaws, ha(Damn, dog!)
Jump on the tour bus and ride out cross country
Pack my bags, bitch, arrive-derce
Next time you hear me probably be on C-D
Next time you see me be on TV ba-by
Hit like ball bats
Thinkin we all that
200 pound, 6-feet tall cat
Talkin bout "where them broads at?"
You got to love that
Seperate the weak hearts from the thug cats
O.G.'s from the rugrats
Chill, Stak, fuck that!
Roll like a bulletproof Tahoe
Sittin on platinum Bravo's
My entourage consists of Down South desperado's
Follow the empty bottles, stems and seeds
Til you find a million motherfuckers just like me
I say...player...play on
I say...player........play on!
