Now when we ride hard we kickin up dust dont leave no body behind to talk, naw naw;
And the only proof that my crew came through'll be the people found lyin in chalk
Allow me to introduce, first crackavelli tha boss;
White boy til i die whatever tha cost
I'll be a lie if i said that i never took losses;
But i'm tellin tha truth when i say it dont happen often
I'll be pissin people off until they put me in a coffin;
I'm a seargent in this army people listen when i'm talkin
Caution!! can't you see we buildin here;
Actin like somethin you ain't'll get you killed in here
I ain't crude or rude i'm just real sincere;
There's no time to worry about your fellings here
Here here's some boots here here's some gear;
You didn't wanna be here ya shouldn't a volunteered
We ridahs round here and we dont take to outsiders roun here;
Know what i mean? it's a known fact that you can get it round here;
And ain't nobody gone tell who did it round here!
Chorus 4 x
I ain't them goofy white boyz from tha movies;
Talk shit and have to kill me ( u hard?) absolutely!
They call me big bill murder all bitches;
Commin out tha woods with the 30 aught sixes
E mack'll hit a bitch with a bar stool troy'll blind side you;
Tan hide you no one'll ever find you
T wayne'll take you to a construction area;
Steal a cement truck and use it to bury ya
Sonny'll make a withdrawl put money on your dome;
My boy alan vaughn put explosives on your phone
When u's in jail put a bomb on your brougham;
And if it goes down i hope your moms ain't home
Dont make me get on the phone with ricky rodriguez;
Bitch ass couldn't handle vicky rodriguez
I'm not familiar with no gentle methods;
You might also likeYou'll be identified by your dental records
Crazy how life changes in just a second;
'specially if we catch you at that intersection
Chorus x 4
I ain't malibu's most wanted i'm nashvilles most hunted;
In my nortside hide out fuckin an countin money
I got 30 hoopties that'll come round through there;
Light that bitch up like new year
I roll with them cold players g's in wheelchairs;
Get up everyday get out and go get theirs
Theres a homie name d-lo somethins wrong with his leg;
And they say he'll be usin cruthes til the day he is dead
But if he up in the club and some shit get said;
He'll pick that crutch up and bust a bitch in his head
I got a homie name wood weigh 350;
Its like havin another me with me
I'll beat that ass when some shit go down;
Saw what are you doin put that pistol down
Lex put that homemade grenade away;
Dam saw where are you goin with that razor blade?!
Chorus x 4
Courage strength bravery;
Start this fight in the v.i.p
This story is history;
And fuck everybody who disagree
We'll fight to the finish never surrender;
You'll have to kill us just remember
We don't die we multiply;
