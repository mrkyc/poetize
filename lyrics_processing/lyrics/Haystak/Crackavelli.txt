I've came time and Time again and again off the top of the mind i didn't require a pen
I only wrote when it was premeditated a mad man lniitic, don't get me agravated
Hits that I've walked straghter and never hesitated
Afiliated related somehow assosiated with the greatest that ever played in my city dawg I used to want my peice of the pie now i want it all
I use ta just want now i want your's
Catch 'em at red lights
Kick in they F* **in' doors
Make 'em get on the floor and tell ya where it's at
And when they ask who sent ya
Tell 'em Big Stak mak

It ain't even safe to have your kids in the car 'cause these fakers know you paid and they know where you are and where you live at, what kind of
Life is that motion censors and gaurd dogs, these people got gaurds dawg
I swear to God I'm not runnin' tell 'em commin' if they commin'
Stop al they Gum bampin' Know i'm dumpin' on somethin'
And leavin' empty rounds all over the ground, you can say one thing
But Stak, I put it down
I held Tennessee down on the west coast
When you don't go no further left without being in the ocean
Time Squre, Been there thinkin' of Young Buck, Pete Gates and Mac Nair
I swear on everything holy to me the only way to stop me is by puttin' holes through me
Ya hoes to me, I ain't scared nereone of ya'll and you gonna F* ** around and make my people burry one a ya'll

These rappers with dimonds and lexas' lookin' a lot like lunches and breakfastes'
Yo Ima have to pay my light bill regaurdless
Thus explainin why I'm heartless
(Haa Ha)
7 Albums, Hunderd thousands, Local rapped 'em outa towned 'em
Hit 'em hard every swing, reputaition's everything
Never came fake or fronted
Gave cash villians what they wanted
Anthems, bangers heated sh*t
Imataters Eat a D**k

We keep 'em commin', Street Flavor, Murder you with a strap for a peice of paper
Stop now? F* *k Naw, F* *k Stak? F* *k Ya'll
Stop the presses call the Florest they sya he's his pronasouras
