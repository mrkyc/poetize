---------verse 1---------
Now I was, once in the mix with some phony homies, who turned they, backs on me when I needed em most, and even tho they my enemies I'm keepin em close, cause I can either sink em or keep em afloat, and while the, ships jumpers go searching for life preservers I'mma stay here and try to repair the holes in my ship, tighten the loose boards on the home that I built, I did this by myself, I didn't never need your help, dudes are dirty, they'll try to fuck ya gal, naw dawg you got it all wrong, I'm your pal, put it on his kids life, lookin you in the eye, knowing the whole time, he tellin a fuckin lie, my go-to-guy, I could depend on you, I don't need people out to get me, with friends like you, I know everybody out there can relate to stak, if they got stab wounds all up and down they back
-------chorus------
I do it all by myself, I don't neeeeeeeed nobody else, and I'mma do fiiiiine without your help, I'mma do it allll by myself
------verse 2--------
Some say I should have talked to ya, told ya dont go, I fucked up, but you should come home though, I just, couldn't fix my mouth to pronounce those syllables, as I was thinking " why postpone the inevitable?" If ya gon' leave me go leave me now, there ya go baby, kick me while I'm down, yeah I got some issues I needa figure out, but I know one thing without a doubt, I can do this alone, all on my own I'm grown, I gotta keep on writing songs, and get money, and maybe one day find somebody who really loves mes, and stands beside me thru anything. Loves me when it's sunny, the same as when it's raining, the life of stak Mac ain't always entertaining, would ya love me if I was slangin', grams on the track? That's love, and anything less than that, I'd rather be

Some say I was a dreamer, others told me I was stupid, iv been described as difficult, some even called me foolish. Iv always had such a passion for music, there was no telling me I wasn't destined to do this, I didn't get where I'm at by making excuses, crying cause you didn't deal me no aces and duces, had my heart broken and been stabbed in the back, career ending injuries that didn't stop stak. Rhyme after rhyme, time a d time again, it ain't always shining and diamond, a lot of time, a lot of grinding, a lot of beers spill in my environment, I alway felt so empty surrounded by people, felt like it was just me, know what I mean? A lot of work, went into making this happen, cause without my people I couldn't of made it rappin, cause
