I look into your eyes and I see a part of me that's gone on now
And I wonder how long I can keep it inside your eyes, ya know?
I look at you and see more possibilities
Little mes with more opportunities
BooBoo I see ya 20 years down the road, when you won't listen to dad, because he old
Ive lived my life, now you gotta live your own
Tell ya bout my experience and just go on, got it?
You're the one that kept me alive boo
Kiki, that's who kept me alive for you
Grandma kept me alive for all ya'll
My only regret is ya never got to see pa-pa
I'm sumthin like him though
Rain, sleet, or snow, no matter what I gotta do or where i gotta go
I never say no, how could I?
When those girls is how I block out the rest of the whole world
Tic-tak-toe to designer bags, sweet 16, daddy tryin to buy ya'll Jags
I look at you and see somebody that used to reside inside me
All of daddy's better qualities
I see innocence, and dilligence, and borderline brilliance
We should try to be more like our children....oh. (x2)
I see in you what I used to see in me
Before they let me see what I never should've seen
Gotti came up, G'd up, straps around her
Bunch of G's given one another daps around her
Hearin me tell killers watch their mouths around her
Mossbergs laid out in the house around her
And shell remember me. Kennedy will never see
People might sell em' out, but never me
I got your back baby, even when you're wrong
You got lost in the world, mommy just come on home
You don't gotta go through anything alone
Regardless of what coast you end up on
I jump on a plane, daddys in route
I may not say baby come back to the house
Stay and fight it out, cause I'm thinkin you could win
Like I came this time, daddy will come right back again

All of daddys better qualities. I see innocence, and dilligence, and borderline brilliance
We should try to be more like our children...oh. (x2)
I see honesty that you don't see in adults
Love in these hugs, more addictive than drugs
I wish I could see the world so innocently, I ain't gon' do to them like you did it to me
I'm the bodyguard, Kevin Costner
I'm whatever falls under bein a father
A protector, provider, companion, padre, listen to you talk and won't say a word all day
I feel your pain like it happened to me, got it?
You're the reason i quit rappin for free
Its like a whole nother level that these babies be on, you should see the grades that these babies bring home
Wow! That's my child, so proud!
And you can see it in her smile and her frown, you don't wanna let em' down
The only ones that make you look at things the other way around
I look at you and see somebody that used to reside inside me
All of daddys better qualities. I see innocence, and dilligence, and borderline brilliance
