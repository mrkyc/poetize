Oooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah
You were looking so good to me
The night we met, I could not see
How deep you were to penetrate my heart
Mmmm
Now that some time has passed
It made me think that this was meant to last
I never wanna be apart, oh no
Don't let me fool you if I'm acting kinda cold to you
It's just a little game I like to play
'Cause when we're together, it just keeps getting better
If I had my way
When do I wanna see you?
When do I wanna please you?
Every day of the week
When do I wanna love you when I'm thinking of you?
Every day of the week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, even on Sunday
Every day of the week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, even on Sunday
Every day of the week
