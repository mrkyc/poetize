Breaking up is hard to do
Everybody's doing it but me and you
If I had nothing but a dollar in my pocket
I'd spend it on you cause I know your love is priceless
Tell me where you wanna go, oh
I don't know how we'll get there
But we'll be close
I'll be your pillow
Lay your head up on me, baby
There won't be no sleepless nights

So I'm not afraid of losing our way
Cause it's not an option, it's not a game
As they fall apart
(they fall apart)
We reach for the stars
(reach for the stars)
I know this, yeah baby

No one compares
It's just not fair to everyone
That doesn't have you
Guess I'm the lucky one (the lucky one)
I promise this
With every kiss
My heart's in this
Tell it to everyone (tell it to everyone)
That I'm the lucky one
Yes, I'm the lucky one

Everyday's a holiday
Cause every time I think about you is a sweet escape
I close my eyes and see yo naked in my bedroom
That's just so sexy to me

I'm not afraid of losing our way
Cause it's not an option, it's not a game
As they fall apart, we reach for the stars
I know this

That no one compares, it's just not fair
To everyone that doesn't have you
Guess I'm the lucky one (the lucky one)
I promise this, with every kiss, my heart's in this
I'll tell it to everyone that I'm the lucky one
Yes, I'm the lucky one

No one compares, it's just not fair
To everyone that doesn't have you
Guess I'm the lucky one (the lucky one)
I promise this, with every kiss, my heart's in this
I'll tell it to everyone that I'm the lucky one
