Another flight to paradise, but it's too far from home
The perfect weather's nice, but it's not where I belong, no
I know this is a life that I signed up for
But I don't need another stamp on my passport
To know where I'm goin'
'Cause I'd rather be nowhere with you, no

Know-it-all's around me
Tellin' me what I need
They don't know enough about me
I know you're probably worried
So, girl, I'll try to hurry
Right back to your love, that's all I want
Oh

I don't wanna let another plane steal me away, no
I don't need to see another view to know (To know)
What I have when I'm there with you
Even on sunny days, sunny days
Paris don't compare to your smile
Even on sunny days, sunny days
Paris don't compare to your smile

Livin' out a duffle bag gets real old real fast
Soon as I get far enough, I wanna run back
Right back to you

Know-it-all's around me
Tellin' me what I need
They don't know enough about me
I know you're probably worried
So, girl, I'll try to hurry
Right back to your love, that's all I want
Oh

I don't wanna let another plane steal me away, no
I don't need to see another view to know (To know)
What I have when I'm there with you
Another hotel room with no one
There at the end of the night
You'd be here with me if I could have it my way (My way)
Paris don't compare to your smile
Even on sunny days, sunny days
Paris don't compare to your smile
Even on sunny days, sunny days
Paris don't compare to your smile
Tell 'em keep the beaches, the penthouse suites
Ain't gotta be the richest if you're with me
Girl, I'm on my way home to see your face
Anywhere with my love's my favorite place (Ooh)
The sun rises in your eyes and sets on me
Nothin', nowhere, nobody could measure your beauty
So you must be where I'm supposed to be
Oh-oh

'Cause I don't wanna let another plane take me away
I don't need to see another view to know
What I have when I'm there with you
Another hotel room with no one
There at the end of the night
You'd be here with me if I could have it my way (My way)
'Cause Paris don't compare to your smile
Even on sunny days, sunny days
Paris don't compare to your smile
Even on sunny days, sunny days
