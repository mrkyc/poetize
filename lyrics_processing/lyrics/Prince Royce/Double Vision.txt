(Girl one) I swear I told myself that she's the one
(Girl two) I hate myself because I love her, too
(Girl one) She don't give me drama, type that you bring home to mama
(Girl two) I try breaking up, but I can't get enough

Got both of 'em on my mind
I don't know where to draw the line
Never been in this place before
But I gotta let one of them go

Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision

(I've got) Double vision
(I've got) Double vision (Ah)

Uh, why you teasin' with your pants on? (Yeah)
Go on ahead, take 'em off, this a dance song (Uh-oh)
Play the ringtone (Ringtone), pour some alcohol (Alcohol)
I don't wanna judge you, babe, but I can see your thong
On, off, kissing all your tickle spots
Faded, having double vision, standing under mistletoe
King, gold chains and watch your cameltoe (Damn)
She gon' say "You can't touch" just like Hammer, though (Can't touch)
I'm on to the crack of dawn (Ooh)
Lifting up your skirt, I'm a flirt, getting mega dome (Ooh)
Call a friend through, use my iPhone
Tell her, "Come over right now," she never got home

Got both of 'em on my mind
I don't know where to draw the line
Never been in this place before
But I gotta let one of them go

Somebody help me (Ooh)
Somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me (Help me, baby)
Somebody help me now (Help me, baby)
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision
(I've got) Double vision
(I've got) Double vision
(I've got, I've got) Double vision (I've got, I've got)
(I've got) Double vision
(I've got)

Somebody help me out
I'm in love with these women
Somebody help me out
I'm in love with these women
Somebody help me out (Help me, baby)
I can't make a decision
Somebody help me out (Oh, oh, oh)

(I've got) Double vision
(I've got) Double vision

Somebody help me (Ooh)
Somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me (Help me, baby)
Somebody help me now (Help me now, help me now)
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision
(I've got) Double vision
