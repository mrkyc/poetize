I know it all gets a little crazy
But I got faith in you and me
I know it's hard but'll never faze me
Cause you let me let it be

I gave it all up but it never was enough
Went up a long road but it led me right to us

Don't let me come down, let me come down
You the one now, you the one now
Got a bad girl back at home now

I know it all gets a little crazy
But I got faith in you and me
I know it's hard but'll never faze me
Cause you let me let it be
You're the only one who doesn't try to change me
Or strain me to take it all off
And for the first time in my life
Feels like my heart is out of these handcuffs
Out of these handcuffs
You might also like
I've been running red lights with the sirens all turned off
But we don't need no drama when you fill me up with love

Don't let me come down, let me come down
Baby, turn around and show a little more
You the one now, only one now

I know it all gets a little crazy
But I got faith in you and me
I know it's hard but'll never faze me
Cause you let me let it be
You're the only one who doesn't try to change me
Or strain me to take it all off
And for the first time in my life
Feels like my heart is out of these handcuffs
Out of these handcuffs

We're so close that it's like we were bodied now
No, must be real but I'm buried now
So like the man that were screaming high

I know it all gets a little crazy
But I got faith in you and me
I know it's hard but'll never faze me
Cause you let me let it be
You're the only one who doesn't try to change me
Or strain me to take it all off
And for the first time in my life
