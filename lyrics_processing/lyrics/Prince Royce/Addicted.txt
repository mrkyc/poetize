Ohhh yeah oh

Sleeping in Sunday morning bodies intertwine
Playing fake
We're awake
But we don't wanna rise
I saved a place on my chest
For you to rest
Your head on me
A part of me is a mess
I must confess
It's to come clean

I am addicted to your touch
No other woman made me want it this much
I can not resist
The warmth of your hips
A single serving is never enough cause I'm addicted to your touch

My schedule is your's today
I'm not in a rush
You could be my little coffee bean
And I will be the moon
Let's rent the movie tonight
And snuggle up inside
Oh-ho yeah-yeah
And when the credits arrive
I'll be by your side
Letting you know...

I am addicted to your touch (mi amor)
No other woman made me want it this much
I can not resist
The warmth of your hips
A single serving is never enough cause I'm addicted to your touch

I want your neck
I want your shoulders
I wanna be the only one to hold you
I want your lips
I want your arms
I wanna be inside your heart
If I don't have you next to me
I'd probably lose my sanity
I am hook on you, addicted

I am addicted to your touch (mi amor)
No other woman made me want it this much
I can not resist
The warmth of your hips
A single serving is never enough cause I'm addicted to your touch

I am addicted to your touch (addicto a tu amor)
No other woman made me want it this much
I can not resist
The warmth of your hips
A single serving is never enough cause I'm addicted to your touch
Oh-whoa addicted to you touch
Oh-ho I'm addicted to your touch
