Driving all night just to say goodbye
Windows down, hair in the wind
Hang up the phone it'll be a long night
Empty pillows, 2 AM
I cannot pretend I won't be lonely
Every minute that you're gone
But trust me, in the end it will be worth it
Cause baby you're the one

I can't even face the daylight
Cause I'm already missing you
Baby, we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you (ah, ah, ahh)
Loving you
Loving you

I'm missing your touch, I'm missing your smile
Love to feel your hands on my skin
Feeling a rush, it makes me go wild
Crazy how you know what I think
I cannot pretend I won't be lonely
Every minute that you're gone
But trust me, in the end it will be worth it
Cause baby, you're the one
You might also like
I can't even face the daylight
Cause I'm already missing you
Baby, we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you

See the clock, close my eyes
Wishing I, could stop the hands of time
Make this kiss, last forever
Forever, we gotta live our lives
But that won't stop me from loving you

I can't even face the daylight
Cause I'm already missing you
Baby, we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you
You got me la-la-la-la-loving you (loving you)
La-la-la-la-loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Driving all night just to say goodbye
Windows down, hair in the wind
I'm mad at myself, I'm struggling now
