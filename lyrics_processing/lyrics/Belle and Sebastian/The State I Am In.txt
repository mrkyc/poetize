I was surprised
I was happy for a day in 1975
I was puzzled by a dream
It stayed with me all day in 1995
My brother had confessed he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sister's wedding day

I got married in a rush
To save a kid from being deported, now she's in love
Oh, I was so touched
I was moved to kick the crutches from my crippled friend
She was not impressed
'Cause I cured her on the Sabbath, I went to confess
When she saw the funny side
We introduced my child bride to whisky and gin
To whisky and gin

The priest in the booth
Had a photographic memory for all he had heard
He took all of my sins
And he wrote a pocket novel called The State That I'm In
So I gave myself to God
There was a pregnant pause before he said ok
Now I spend my day
Turning tables round in Marks & Spencer
They don't seem to mind
See Belle and Sebastian LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in

Oh, love of mine
Would you condescend to help me?
'Cause I am stupid and blind
Oh, and desperation is the Devil's work
It is the folly of a boy's empty mind
Oh, and now I'm feeling dangerous
Riding on city buses for a hobby is sad
Why don't you lead me to a living
And I promise that I'd entertain my crippled friend
My crippled friend

I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in

I gave myself to sin
And I've been there and back again
