I had a funny dream
You were wearing funny shoes
You were going to a dance
You were dressed like a punk
But you are too young to remember
Glad to see you
I'm outside the house
I'm not thinking right today
I've got no energy
I'm glad that you are waiting with me
Tell me all about your day
Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
And wondering how things could've been
I'm happy for you
You've made it hard for me
I counted on your company
You are staying with your friends tonight
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I keep taking everything to be a sign
See Belle and Sebastian LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also likeI'm happy for you
Now I know this hurt is poison
Too sharp to be bled
I'm sitting on my empty bed
I'm on my empty bed
At night, the fever grows, it's pounding pounding
I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
Watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo
Scary moment, lovin' every moment
I was high from playing shows
We lost a singer to her clothes
My trouble raised its ugly head
I was revealed and I was home in bed
I was a kid again
Jesus told me, go after every coin
Like it was the last in the world
And protect the wayward child
But I'm a little lost sheep
I need my Bo Peep
You know I need my shepherd here tonight
Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
And a wondering how things could've been
I'd like to see you, but really I should stay away
And let you settle down
I've got no claims to your crown
I was the boss of you and I loved you
You know I loved you
It's all over now
I was there for you
When you were lonely
I was there when you were bad
I was there when you were sad
Now it's my time of need
I'm thinking, do I have to plead to get you by my side?
I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
Watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
