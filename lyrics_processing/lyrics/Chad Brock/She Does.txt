The first time I struck a conversation up
But I think that she does
I don't recall what song was playing
The first that I finally felt her touch
But I'm pretty sure that she does
All of those moments now are just a blur
Don't know exactly when I fell for her
But she does something to me that I can't explain
She's a walk in the park, she's a runaway train
She lifts me up, she calms me down
When I can't turn my life around
She does and I probably don't even see
All the little things that she does for me
If anybody on this earth knows the meaning of love
She does
I know my family means the world to me
But sometimes I forget to call them up
I know that she does
I'm working hard every single day
I don't know how to say enough's enough
She does
Without her love I would be half a man
Sometimes I know I'm hard to understand

She does
She does something to me that I can't explain
She's a walk in the park, she's a runaway train
She's an anchor in a raging sea
When I need to fly she gives me wings
She does and I probably don't even see
All the little things that she does for me
If anybody on this earth knows the meaning of love
