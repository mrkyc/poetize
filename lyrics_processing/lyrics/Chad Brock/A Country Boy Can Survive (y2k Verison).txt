December 31st nineteen ninety-nine
People buyin' up army surplus things
Afraid of what the new year will bring
I live back in the woods you see
Y2k don't mean a thing to me
I've got a shotgun, a rifle
And a four wheel drive
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'till dawn
Make our own whiskey
And our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these ol' boys can't do

We grow good ol' tomatoes
And homemade wine
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
'cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive in the millenium
We say grace
And we say ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn
You might also likeWe came from the west virginia coal mines
And the rocky mountains and the western skies
If the bank machines crash
We'll be just fine
'cause a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
I had a good friend in new york city
He never called me bocephus
Called me hillbilly

But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For forty-three dollars my friend lost his life
Now this dude's gonna get out in a year or two
'cause the system don't work for me and you
But a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
'cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive in the millenium
We say grace
And we say ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn
We're from north california
And south alabam'
And little towns all around this land
If the bank machine's crash
We'll be just fine
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
Country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
