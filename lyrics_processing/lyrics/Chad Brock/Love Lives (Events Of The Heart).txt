Of the small-town daily news
It read Lilah Thompson had a baby boy
Six pounds at 10:02
But they didn't list the father
He was carefully ignored
No mention of the scuffle in the corridor
But the questions still got asked
At the nurse's station he was close enough
To hear her call his name
He said, "It isn't fair, but if he knows I'm here
Her dad will go insane
If there's something you can do about it
Would you try
I just want to hear our baby cry
Even if it's through the glass"
Oh, once in awhile when the odds are against love
And all the events of the heart are on trial
If somebody gives
And leaves the door open
To the power of hope and the will to forgive
Love lives
Three suitcases and a baby seat
And their lives were in a car
Stealing off to the city where they both believed
They could make it if they worked real hard
You might also likeThree weeks later they were out of that cheap motel
Having dinner at the Taco Bell
When he gave her the ring
Oh, once in awhile when the odds are against love
And all the events of the heart are on trial
If somebody gives
And leaves the door open
To the power of hope and the will to forgive
Love lives
When the preacher said, "If anyone objects
Speak now or hold your peace"
Every eye in the church turned to watch the man
Who rose up from his seat
But when he said
"I'm sorry for the things I didn't understand
Can I give you to this man"
Everybody cried
Oh, once in awhile when the odds are against love
And all the events of the heart are on trial
If somebody gives
And leaves the door open
To the power of hope and the will to forgive
Love lives
