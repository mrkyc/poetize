An she needed a sholder to cry on
She turned to another
And for a night found a lover
But it felt so wrong
The next month they reconziled
But everytime she saw him smile
She knew she couldn't tell him 'bout that night
She prays to god he never finds out about the lie
Like a pain almost to much to bare
The guilt will always be right there
Ripping away at her heart
Some would say shes wrong to keep
The secret from him but she knows the truth, will tare his world apart
Shes gonna live and die with the lie
There little boy turned five the other day
At the party she never seen a face so happy
She worry's as the years go by
Will he wonder why he dont look like his daddy
She see's him playing in the yard
The laughter sometimes hits her hard
The bond they share makes her start to cry
And times like that she'd give anything
If she could change the lie

But everyday they pass at work and she wonders if he knows
Like a pain almost to much to bare
The guilt will always be right there
Ripping away at her heart
Some would say shes wrong to keep
The secret from him but she knows the truth, will tare his world apart
Shes gonna live and die
