No life in the past (Although she tried to turn and run away)
No life for the future (No life in the past)
How we love you
No life for the future (No life for the future times)
No life in the past (Although she tried to turn and run away)
No life for the future (No life in the past)
How we love you
Take a look at your future
Take a look at the past
Just the same for your future life
How long can it last
Can I live for my own life
Can he live on his own
Creating my own new world
Why feeling so scared
This life from day to day
His every need, I try to please
His life to ease however hard
Do as I say
Don't think for yourself
Can't see which way to turn
You might also likeThose tear filled nights all alone
Just crying out on my own
Lying back, the pain, the breath
The hands all over me
Better this than the other way
Can't get away
I'm all alone
All alone
All alone
Can't get away
I'm all alone
All alone
All alone
Life for the future times
Although she tried to turn and run away
No life for the past
Life for the future times
Although she tried to turn and run away
No life for the past
Take a look at the future
Take a look at the past
Can I live for my own life
Can he live on his own
Well Autumn's here in the scale of life
No more a lover, no more a wife
Take no note of passing time
Swiftly reaching the end of the line
Dragging you down with him
Facing the truth that you don't love him
Turn your back and walk away
Time to look for a brand new day
He cares for me, he shares with me
We're mirror in our home
As the words come out, the truth it hits
It's there I've always known
I've been holding out
That love will find its way
Hoping that love will come
Holding on
While the love just fades away
Well Autumn's here in the scale of life
No more a lover, no more a wife
Make a note of passing time
Live it full to the end of the line
Facing a new world
See the truth that you don't need him
Turn your back and walk away
Time to start a brand new day
This house a home, it's just my cage
I've got to break free
To sing and dance, to laugh to love
But most of all be me
I've been holding out
But now I'll find the way
Living my life again
Moving on
