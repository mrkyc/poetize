Can't seem to find my way
Know that I just don't belong
Find that true path some day
Searching so long in this life
Looking for something right
All roads were leading me here
Finally on this night
Young man
Will you offer a life?
Will you give me a life?
For you own
Don't look back
Will you give all you are
To reach for that star?
All you own
To give your life, to make it today
To give your soul, a price that's to pay
Ahead is the road I must take
To live by this promise I make
A dream come true is it the way?
The give to use from this day
Life moves on so I must choose
Make my way singing those blues
The promise made so it can start
Now locked in my heart
You might also likeYou will live, you'll die
On your knees, ask why
All the thoughts in your head
Body filled, with dread
When the day has come
When your time is over
In a time, to come
Thinking back, where you're from
Memories, they fade
Promises, you made
When my day has come
Calling out I'll remember again
When my time has come
Will I have the strength
To face the truth?
Memory fading falling
Memory fading falling
Now you live, your days
Like a god, that plays
Your name, revered
See the path, revealed
When the time has come
When I'm calling out
Given the bonds to break
Given the time for freedom
Given the bonds to break
Given the time for freedom
Given the bonds to break
Given the time for freedom
When my day has come
Calling out I'll remember again
When my time has come
Will I have the strength
To face the truth?
Memory fading falling
Memory fading falling
Walk alone on a road that has no end
With a gift - broken hearts and souls to mend
As the music heals the land
The gift within my hand
Prayed for love, for a love that won't forsake
Lie alone - couldn't see her heart would break
In a new world every day
On the streets where I would play
With a heart still yearning
With the drink there every day
And the blues that touch your heart
For the songs are healing
The songs, they are loving
As the blues, they touch your heart
Feel their heartache
Feel the pain
Feel the love in every heart
No more rain clouds
No more summertime
No more life to live
So I'm on my knees
And I beg you please
Give me time to live
I have more to give
See me change my ways
Time to rearrange
My song to sing
All the time passed
Give me one more chance
Give my heart and soul
In the final song
Let me wander
