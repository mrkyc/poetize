My press have come for me
And I don't want to be free
My public lust to see
Soon there will come a time
Maybe this is the tune
They're looking out
They're looking out for me
Maybe this is the time
It's finally come for me
The crowds are here
But are they here for me
Heaven be praised
The press have come for me
Just a slip of the tongue
The headlines run again
Don't look now
I think it's a camera
A smile, a kiss and a wave
As I'm carried away
And they all know
As I grow old
I will always be here for you now
I will play the fool for you all
I will always live here with my crowd
And you will see
That I will please
You might also likeHeaven be praised
My press have come for me
And I don't want to be free
The public lust to see
Heaven be praised
Maybe this is the time
It's finally come for me
They're looking out
And they looking out for me
Maybe this is the time
It's finally come for me
The crowds are here
But are they here for me
Heaven be praised
My press have come for me
And I don't want to be free
My public lust to see
Don't look now
I think it's a camera
A drunken stumble, some flesh
As they drag me away
And they all know
As I grow old
I will always be here for you now
I will play the fool for you all
I will always live here with my crowd
And you will see
That I will please
You and I we have a need
You and I we have a need to fil our lives
I need love you need my pain
Drink and drugs the men who leave again
Feel my pain (The looks they fade, the will is weak)
Feel my pain (Body is old but the surgeons knife)
Pray for me
And I mistake for you
You and I we have a need
You and I we have a need to fil our lives
I need love you need my pain
Fame it fades never to come again
Feel my pain (No curtain calls, a life so still)
Feel my pain (Mind so numb, lose the will)
Pray for me
Pray for me
And my mistakes my friends
Laughing the day away, hoping the day
Crying the day away
Fame will live again
My fame will live again
Spend the day in a wam safe place
Re-live the life, re-live the life, living
Spend the day at the studio place
Re-live the life, re-live the life, living
Spend my life in this wam safe place
Re-live the life, re-live the life, living
Spend my life at this chosen pace
Re-live the life, re-live the life, living
Laughing the day away, making the day
Living the life once more
Fame is here to stay
My fame its here today
Art mimics life
To hell with the rest
And Daddy says that he knows beat
Do as you are told
Don't think you're old
The secret never told
He leaves me
My leading man, he's all dressed in white
Don't tell abouit our secret nights
Do as I am told
Doesn't mind I'm old
Secrets never told
He loves me
People around
Like Angel and Damned
I dance and I sing
My life once more
People around
Like Angel and Damned
I dance and I sing
