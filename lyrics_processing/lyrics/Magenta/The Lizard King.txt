Always be the one out on his own
Never gonna hide the sight of death away
Living in a world where all is good
Never gonna be all that I should
A time to open up my mind
The fears to live, the truth to find, my way
Looking down
Looking down into my soul
I am the light - I am the love
I am the darkness inside
You are my life - you are my life
Fading so far away
Never have I seen the sun shine so bright
Walking in the heat into the night
Never having dream that time would slip away
Stepping out upon the stage - the noise
Singing out the words, one will, one voice
A time to open up my mind
The fears to live, a truth to find, my way
Looking down
Looking down into my soul
I am the light - I am the love
I am the darkness inside
You are my life - you are my life
Fading so far away
I am the light - I am the love
I am the darkness inside
You are my life - you are my life
Fading so far away
Far away
You might also likeWould you offer me a life?
Would you give to me your soul?
Will you give to me all you are
And all you own the truth to learn at last?
The words I hear - from a past
In a dream in darkness I fall
Heaven and hell
Light is shining bright
Confusion all around
Feed the fear in blackest night
The colours of the crown
See the truth in your eyes
See the truth in your eyes
Hear the spirit sounds
Speak to me as one
Reaching out a blood-stained hand
Hear the truth in your voice
Hear the truth in your voice
When the time has come to pass
To free your soul at last
I will find you
When the time has come to pass
The lizard king at last
I will find you
The love I'm looking for
Descending from above
Achieve the state of perfect grace
That's what I'm dreaming of
I will find the love, I will find the love
When my heart is gonna break
The dreamer will awake
I will find you
When my soul is open wide
The doorway you will find
I will love you
See chaos from the stage
Corrupting every age
Another hand controls me
Through others I can see
When my heart is gonna break
I will love you
Standing on the edge
Looking into space
The way is down I see the end
The darkness I embrace
I will live again, I will live again
I've lived the life of pain
Excess has played its part
I've had the time of which you dream
Now hold me in your arms
When my heart is gonna break
My life he has to take
I will love you
When you're searching through the night
To find me in the light
I will love you
As I look in to your eyes
I see the new sunrise
When my heart is gonna break
I will love you, I will love you
Just keep holding on
I will love you
Just keep holding on
Just keep holding on
I'll be waiting - far away
Far away
