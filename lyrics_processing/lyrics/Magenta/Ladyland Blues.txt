Watch the sunlight fade
See my day by night
The sounds they spin my head
Look around
Look around
Never stop, have my time to live
Always try to give
Get the feeling that I belong
See the people on the street
As they move their feet
They're all dancing to life's sweet song
It gets inside your head
It fills your heart
It takes your breath away
It reaches out in time
When you play your part
Here to stay
A part to play
You're here to stay
Don't fade away
Inspiration comes from around
Every sight every sound
It's the music that tells the tale
Ideas flow, they come so fast
Feeling free at last
No more heart and soul for sale
You might also likeIt gets inside your head
It fills your heart
It takes your breath away
It reaches out in time
When you play your part
Here to stay
Love will find you
Work its way into your heart
Let that love grow
Look around it plays its part forever
Light the flame that never dies
That guides you on
Love may leave you
Break your will and break your heart
Still the love grows
Around the world it plays its part forever
Light the flame that never dies
That guides you on
Through life
Love can heal us
Love can hold us
A little bit of love can make it right
When truths are spoken
Worlds are broken
Feel the pain inside
Inside
River
Running
Forever
Ever
Lover's fading
Fading
Body racing, mind retreating
Death defying, soul revealing
Fading
Fading
Fading out
Within the night
People are living
The lights they shine
Showing the way
Before the dawn
Deep in their slumber
The city wakes
Rising up into the day
The sun comes up to lead the way
To bring us hope - once more
A rainbow rising
Across the sky
Sign of forever
What love can make you
