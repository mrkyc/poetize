Hear her calling, have to dress and run
Live a life in the daylight?
No time for fun
No time for run
Onward
Working down on the final line
Just a number, working day to day
Clocking on in the morning
Working the line
Working the line
At the end of the day
In our own happy world
All the light that you bring
You're my life my one and only
At the end of the day -------- Cherish time, you know it won't last
In our own happy world -------- Cherish time, life flies so fast
All the light that you bring -------- Cherish time, you know it won't last
You're my life my one and only
Weekend comes, Old London Town
Work the tables, no time here for fun
Coming home Sunday morning
Taking her back
Taking her back
Onward

Climb into bed the day has just begun
An hours sleep and she's stirring
Ready to play
Ready to play
Is it worth all the time -------- Live life, give love a chance
The people they say -------- Live life, she's growing fast
Having no real life -------- Live life, give love a chance
Working hard throughout the day
Now is the time -------- Cherish time, you know it won't last
You are wasting your life -------- Cherish time, life flies so fast
Not a mother they want -------- Cherish time, you know it won't last
Don't waste your life
Don't waste your life waiting
Don't waste your life waiting
There sleeps my girl
She'll have all time, a life of times
I hope and pray
No cares or woes in this small world no reasons
Fragile life to play
My life's a mess
But there's a hope in my heart
To give her a start
The things they say
She'll never hear in this her life
I hope and pray
Move on through life, her head held high
To live a life so young, so free
My life's a mess
But there's a hope in my heart
To give her a start
A hope in my heart
To give her a start
Every time you smile the sun shines down on me
Every time you smile the world feels right it's all there to see
Every time you smile the sun shines down on me
Every time you smile the world feels right the sun shines on me
Every time you smile the sun shines down on me
Every time you smile the world feels right it's all there to see
