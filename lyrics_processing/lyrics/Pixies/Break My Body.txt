I'm the horny loser
You'll find me crashin' through my mother's door
I am the ugly lover
You'll find us rolling on the dirty floor

Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones

I'm a belly dancer
I'll shake for Arabs and I'll never care
I'm a building jumper
Roof to roof, you see me flying in the air

Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones
Hold my bones, bones
