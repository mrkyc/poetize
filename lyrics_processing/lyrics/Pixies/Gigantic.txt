And this I know, his teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her every day into a shady place
With her lips she said, she said

"Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball"

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love

Lovely legs, they're a...
What a big black mess, what a hunk of love
He'd walk her every day into a shady place
He's like the dark, but I'd want him

"Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball"
