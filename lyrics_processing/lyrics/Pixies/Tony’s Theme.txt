This is a song about a superhero named Tony
It's called "Tony's Theme"

He's got the oil on his chain for a ride in the rain, no baloney
Ride around on my bicycle like a pony
I'm waving hi, hi, hi, hi, hi
G-g-g-gimme a scream
Gimme, gimme the theme of Tony

I am Tony, super bicycle Tony, I'm racing
Spitfire turning, pop a wheelie burning, evil chasing
I'm waving bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
I got a card in my spokes
I'm practicing my jokes, I'm learning

I can look at the sun if you give me some bad sunglasses
I'm back on the road, hip-hopping grass like a toad
After classes
