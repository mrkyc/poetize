This thing called life
Now what's the meaning of the line (Tell me)
Well, it's like dreaming of your goals
Ambitions for feeling free
I'm on this mission to achieve (Achieve what?)
What's in your mind's eye
This is what you believe you should gain (Uh-huh)
Satisfaction becomes a shining example
A test is a sample of a new race
That has ample supply of positivity (You mean flow?)
Well, like electricity (So)
You see a clear way with no ambiguity
Don't you know

Elevate your mind, free your soul

Feel the feeling, let your body take control

Elevate your mind, free your soul
(Well, come on, come on)
Feel the feeling, let your body take control

Well, don't be afraid to experiment, you know, hmm
Go ahead, you know and implement your ideas
Your notions, put 'em in motion
Like the words the funky dreads have spoken to you
So listen up loud and clear

What ya gonna do? Put it in your life tool
Now that's the meaning of the line
