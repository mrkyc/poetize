Well, it's Friday and we're gettin' tore up
Goin' down to the river in the back of Fred's truck
Remember one time you said it was all right
Go get juiced down by the riverbed tonight

See, it's late now and I gotta get you home
'Cause your mama don't like me and you being alone
I asked you a couple of time and you said it was all right
Let's go rootin' 'round the riverbed tonight

Won't you tell me that you love me, if it's true
I don't want no one, baby, if I can't have you
This Oklahoma Breakdown sure do got you crying
Let me tell you that I love you one more time

Well, it's Friday and we ain't even started gettin' tore up yet
