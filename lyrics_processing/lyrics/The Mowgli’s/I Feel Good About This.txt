Just yelling off the balcony
Late July
Just waiting for your friends to leave
And finally
So can we, so can we
In the back of the car
Trying to stay awake
I can tell from the stars
That we're at LA
With your hand hanging out the window
Like you're riding on a wave
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're always running
Running away
I've been looking for love in the distance
Down the sidewalks of cities I visit
Up the coast looking for something different
All along you were there but I missed it
I don't know what it is
But I feel good about this
La la la la la
You might also likeAll around the only thing I ever really think about
And even in the dark I see the light somehow
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound
In the back of the car
Trying to stay awake
I can tell from the stars
That we're at LA
With your hand hanging out the window
Like you're riding on a wave
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're always running
Running away
I've been looking for love in the distance
Down the sidewalks of cities I visit
Up the coast looking for something different
All along you were there but I missed it
I don't know what it is
But I feel good about this
La la la la la
I feel good about this
You and I just yelling off the balcony
All the time
Just waiting for your friends to leave
And finally
So can we, so can we
I've been looking for love in the distance
Down the sidewalks of cities I visit
Up the coast looking for something different
All along you were there but I missed it
I love the floor but it wasn't consistent
I didn't know just how badly I need this
I'm looking at you we're laughing and screaming
Head out the window
I love you, I mean it
I don't know what it is
But I feel good about this
La la la la la
I feel good about this
