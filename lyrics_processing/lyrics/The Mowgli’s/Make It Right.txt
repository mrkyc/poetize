And it ain't hard to take you home but that don't make it right
And you were different from your friends
You didn't live in magazines
You were crying all the time
Wish I could make it right
But you've been hanging 'round these days more than I'd like

We fall in love in every dream
We shared a bed but couldn't sleep
We have some kind of love but that don't make it right
And all the silly little things that you said but you didn't mean
We got real good love but that don't make it right
And you can say I'm wrong but that don't make it right
I'm just a little bit too late and you know I get that way
And if I had a chance I swear I'd apologize
But you leave before I wake to wherever it is you go these days
And that's fine but it still don't make it right

We fall in love in every dream
We shared a bed but couldn't sleep
We have some kind of love but that don't make it right
And all the silly little things that you said but you didn't mean
We got real good love but that don't make it right
And you can say I'm wrong but that don't make it right
You might also like
We fall in love in every dream
We shared a bed but couldn't sleep
We have some kind of love but that don't make it right
And all the silly little things that you said but you didn't mean
We got real good love but that don't make it right
And you can say I'm wrong but that don't make it right

We fall in love in every dream
We shared a bed but couldn't sleep
We have some kind of love but that don't make it right
And all the silly little things that you said but you didn't mean
We got real good love but that don't make it right
