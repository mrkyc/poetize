Just dunno anything else
Spent so long deep in love with you
Fell out of love with myself
I'm screaming at your memory
I'm saying "get the hell right out of my house"
So I take your pictures off the wall
And it's just me and Johnny Walker left around
You can lie lie lie
You can lie to me
I don't care I'm not losing sleep
If it don't bother you
It sure as hell don't bother me
Man, it feels good to be alone sometimes
God I gotta say those are my favorite nights
When no one's around, and I'm still speaking my mind
Man, it feels good to be alone sometimes
I'm not alone 'cause I wanna be alone
It's just the way it went down
It didn't hurt as much at first
But I can't believe how much it's killing me now
I keep on going out
And I keep wondering why I keep on going out
So I call myself a car
And ask the driver "where the hell we going now?"

It sure as hell don't bother me
Man, it feels good to be alone sometimes
God i gotta say those are my favorite nights
When no one's around, and I'm still speaking my mind
Man, it feels good to be alone sometimes
You can lie to me
But I ain't losin' sleep
While you're rollin' around
In someone else's dreams
If it don't bother you
It don't bother me
It kinda feels like I won the lottery
Get away from me
Get away from me
God it feels good to be alone
Man, it feels good to be alone sometimes
God I gotta say those are my favorite nights
When no one's around, and I'm still speaking my mind
Everybody's gotta be alone
Man, it feels good to be alone sometimes
God I gotta say those are my favorite nights
When no one's around, and I'm still speaking my mind
Man, it feels good to be alone sometimes
God it feels good to be alone sometimes
