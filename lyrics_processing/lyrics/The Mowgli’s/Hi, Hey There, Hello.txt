Have you got some place to go?
Well, I've got some time and I would love to take you out
I've got two nickels to my name--
Well, hey, my story sounds the same
But I'll find some way to show you what life's all about
Well, we could take a walk downtown
No, let's search for higher ground
We'll count the clouds and stars and howl at the moon
I hear the rich folk come here too
Cause it's such a lovely view
And when the sun decides to rise
It'll be too soon
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, my blood may run red
But the thoughts in my head
They are blue, they are purple, they are gold
And there may come a day
Where my hair it turns grey
But my soul, oh my soul will never grow old
You might also likeSee, I'm not skin and bones
I am sunshine and snow
I'm this ever-changing Earth that we know
I'll melt into a stream
I will glisten and gleam
I'll float on but I'll never grow old
I'll float on but I'll never grow old
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh, well, hi, hey there, hello
Have you got some place to go?
Well, I've got some time and I would love to take you out
I've got two nickels to my name--
Well, hey, my story sounds the same
But I'll find some way to show you what life's all about
Five, six
Five, six, seven, eight
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh, well, hi, hey there, hello
Have you got some place to go?
