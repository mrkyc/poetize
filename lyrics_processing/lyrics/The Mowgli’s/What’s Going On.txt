Now I'm flying alone, sad wasted space
Now everyone around seems to have figured it out, like, yesterday
What about me, am I asleep?
And if the window leaks than we can drink the water
But if you suddenly feel weak in the knees do you bother?
If the rain gets in, we can wash our hands
Because there's always time for living life
If the sun is out, we'll go out of our house
It's better for you, better for me
To get outside and see what's going on
Well I was on a walk, I heard an old lady talk straight to a clock
Her head must have been up in space
And when I looked around I saw a man asleep on the ground
He was wearing a frown upside down I saw his face
And if the window leaks than we can drink the water
But if you suddenly feel weak in the knees do you bother?
If the rain gets in, we can wash our hands
Because there's always time for living life
If the sun is out, we'll go out of our house
It's better for you, better for me
To get outside and see what's going on
You might also likeWhat's going on
What if the earth should start to fall?
What if the sky came down below?
Follow your only will
Open your heart and to this life you wanted to love from the stars
If you just think about it, don't even bother
Well if you just think about it, well no there's no need to bother
If the rain gets in, we can wash our hands
Because there's always time for living life
If the sun is out, we'll go out of our house
It's better for you, better for me
To get outside and see what's going on
