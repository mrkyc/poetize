Cherish this, 'cause when it doesn't last, you'll wish you had
I will cherish this
I will be humble again
What will it take to get me to get where I'm going?
Do you know the way?
Do you know when the tunnel ends?
Lord have mercy on me
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
I see house of lies built upon a foundation of sand
That was our house
That was our life, but we fell in
Then it was dark and we could see no more
But somehow we found each other
Somehow we found hope
If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will
If you carry your will, I will carry my will
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
Let your faith guide your faith, let your faith guide your faith
