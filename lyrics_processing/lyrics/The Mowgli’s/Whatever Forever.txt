Well I'm slowly waking up
To the screaming southern sun
Marching straight at me
Like soldiers through my eyes
And is this all I'll ever be?
Just so hungover in your sheets
And I'll be wondering about that all my life

But it's alright
It's getting better all the time
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright

And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
You know we're falling together
And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
And it just keeps getting better

Well I sit up on your bed
And you just biting at my neck
You're begging, "Baby, please don't
Baby, don't you leave"
But I gotta go and write these songs
So you don't have to get a job
And you just smile at me and drift back into sleep
You might also like
But it's alright
It's getting better all the time
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright

And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
You know we're falling together
And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
And it just keeps getting better

Whoa, oh, oh, it keeps getting better
Whoa, oh, oh, (I said) it keeps getting better
Whoa, oh, oh, it keeps getting better
Whoa, oh, oh, it's whatever forever

And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
You know we're falling together
And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
And it just keeps getting better
And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
You know we're falling together
And when the sun comes up
Like it always does
It's whatever forever
And it just keeps getting better

I went and wrote this song
So you don't have to get a job
