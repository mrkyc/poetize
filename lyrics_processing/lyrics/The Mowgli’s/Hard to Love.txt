There's somethin' in my head keepin' me awake
And I wonder if I'll ever let it go
Now I'm layin' in my bed up in outer space
Darlin', think there's maybe somethin' you should know

I'm a little bit hard to love
Yeah, I'm a little bit hard to love

I'm a little bit hard to love
I think I do that on purpose
I know I don't give you much
I know it makes you nervous
And I don't wanna work you up
Don't want you to find out down the line
So I'm just gonna say this once
Baby, I'm a little bit hard to love
Baby, I'm a little bit hard to love

Cards are on the table, ain't nothing left
I told you everything, now won't you stay?
Then you make that face like you're not impressed
And I don't know another way to say
You might also like
I'm a little bit hard to love
I think I do that on purpose
I know I don't give you much
I know it makes you nervous
And I don't wanna work you up
Don't want you to find out down the line
So I'm just gonna say this once
Baby, I'm a little bit hard to love
Baby, I'm a little bit hard to love
Baby, I'm a little bit hard to love

And I get the feeling that it's not enough
And I'm afraid you'll find a better love
I get the feeling that it's not enough
And I'm afraid you'll find a better love

Oh, hard to love
Yeah, I'm hard to love
I'm hard to love
Yeah, I'm hard to love
I don't wanna work you up (No, oh no)
I'm just gonna say this once
Baby, I'm a little bit hard to love
Baby, I'm a little bit hard to love
