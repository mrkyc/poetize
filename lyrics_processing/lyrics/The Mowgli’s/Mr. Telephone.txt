I don't wanna sit tight, I don't wanna be nameless
I don't wanna be right 'cause I know what pain is
I wanna be clear, I wanna see some changes
I don't wanna be right, already know what pain is

Ooh, Mr. Telephone
Where do you go? Where do you go?
Yeah, ooh, Mr. Telephone
What do you know now that you've been gone?

What a sign of the time it is
It's got me feeling like I'm rolling all the dice again
I believe in every single thing that we have built
So wave goodbye, goodbye to everyone

Are you alone in the night and do you fight that feeling?
If you wanna be right, better pick up the pieces start believing
I heard something only you know
Coming through that speaker next to me
I could barely understand, but I think it said

Ooh, Mr. Telephone
Where do you go? Where do you go?
Yeah, ooh, Mr. Telephone
What do you know now that you've been gone?
You might also like
What a sign of the time it is
It's got me feeling like I'm rolling all the dice again
I believe in every single thing that we have built
So wave goodbye, goodbye to everyone

If I could sleep, come on with me
Come wave goodbye, come wave goodbye now
If I could sleep, come on with me
Come wave goodbye, come wave goodbye now

Yeah, ooh, Mr. Telephone
Where do you go? Where do you go?
Yeah, ooh, Mr. Telephone
What do you know now that you've been gone?

What a sign of the time it is
It's got me feeling like I'm rolling all the dice again
I believe in every single thing that we have built
So wave goodbye, goodbye to everyone

If I could sleep, come on with me
Come wave goodbye, come wave goodbye now
If I could sleep, come on with me
