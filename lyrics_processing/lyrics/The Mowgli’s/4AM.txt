Of course your birthday
Will be some place that no one's heard of
Another place where finding parking sucks
The drinks are cheap enough so drink 'til your eyes shut
Dizzy and amusing
Of course your best friend
Would sit there staring at me sideways
Crossing his arms across the table
I see your path splitting two ways
Photo with your cute face
It's 4 AM hey, I just gotta get away
There's nothing you could say to make me want to stay
I'm bored to death in here, wish I could disappear
Take you to the bathroom, howl at the full moon, take me to space
It's 4 AM hey, I just gotta get away
We need a hero
She was a ten, he was a zero
I had to steal her like De Niro
But I ain't even gonna take her home to shake my bones
It's 4 AM hey, I just gotta get away
There's nothing you could say to make me want to stay
I'm bored to death in here, wish I could disappear
Take you to the bathroom, howl at the full moon, take me to space
It's 4 AM hey, I just gotta get away
You might also likeIt's 4 AM and I'm really hoping you will stay
'Cause it would tear me up if I had to watch you walk away
It's 4 AM hey, I just gotta get away
There's nothing you could say to make me want to stay
I'm bored to death in here, wish I could disappear
Take you to the bathroom, howl at the full moon, take me to space
It's 4 AM hey, I just gotta get away
It's 4 AM
It's 4 AM
It's 4 AM
I really gotta get away
It's 4 AM
It's 4 AM
It's 4 AM
