It's getting heavy
I'm going crazy
A little bit of rock and roll
Eyes closed to the radio
And when you touch me
It's almost like you love me
I kinda think that you might know
The way I'm feeling

Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
And I think that it's alright
'Cause looking back
I'm falling in love with you every single night
You know that feeling, right
Where everything is fine, just fine
I keep falling in love with you in the summertime
I keep falling in love with you in the summertime
I keep falling in love with you in the summer

You're looking brand new
Hands out the sun roof
And I just can't deny it
Don't act like you don't like it
The mess you make me
Don't recognize who I've been lately
You've got me flying
Straight through the roof
You might also like
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
And I think that it's alright
'Cause looking back
I'm falling in love with you every single night
You know that feeling, right
Where everything is fine, just fine
I keep falling in love with you in the summertime
I keep falling in love with you in the summertime

I guess I'm facing the truth that you finally won
You got that look in your eyes like a loaded gun
In a place, in a time that I never was
It's all because I'm coming undone

I can't get you off of my mind
But I think that it's alright
'Cause looking back
I'm falling in love with you every single night
You know that feeling, right
Where everything is fine, just fine
I keep falling in love with you in the summertime
I keep falling in love with you in the summertime
I keep falling in love with you in the summertime
I keep falling in love with you in the summertime
