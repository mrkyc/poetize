Well, this is new and I'm just tryna wrap my head around it
I didn't know what I was missing, but I guess I found it
And now I'm feeling this is real, I gotta deal with it
Don't always know just what to say, but we should talk about it
Here we are we, found ourselves in quite a situation
I never thought I'd be having this kind of conversation
I gotta deal with these feeling, this is real
But I should find the words to say, we need to talk about it

I think it's weird, you've been here all this time
And I don't know if I could love you, but I'll try
Maybe the universe is giving us a sign
And I don't know if I could love you, but let's talk about it

Ooh, let's talk about it
We need to talk about it
Talk about it
Ooh, let's talk about it

You and I were perfect strangers up until this moment
I got a lot to learn, a lot to give, a lot to show ya
And now we're dealing with these feelings, this is real
I get so nervous, but I'm better when we talk about it

I think it's weird, you've been here all this time
And I don't know if I could love you, but I'll try
Maybe the universe is giving us a sign
And I don't know if I could love you, but let's talk about it

Ooh, let's talk about it
We need to talk about it
Talk about it
Ooh, let's talk about it

I think it's weird, you've been here all this time
And I don't know if I could love you, but I'll try
Maybe the universe is giving us a sign
And I don't know if I could love you, but let's talk about it

Ooh, let's talk about it
We need to talk about it
Talk about it
