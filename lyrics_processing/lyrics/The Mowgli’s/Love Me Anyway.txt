Not been thinking enough
She's been coming around, but I've been gone
I've been taking my time
Always walking that line
Between what I know is right and what is wrong
Just another day of growing up
I get stuck in my romance and
I can't win no matter what I say
But you love me anyway
Oh, you know I love you
But no, I'm not a saint
Oh, I make stupid mistakes
But you love me anyway
And I forgot your birthday
And yeah, I show up late
Oh, I'll get it right someday
'Cause you love me anyway
I've been smoking too much
But I'm giving it up
I feel this air in my lungs, so won't you stay?
'Cause I go crazy sometimes
Always think that I'm right
You're my love and life forever, babe
