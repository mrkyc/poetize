Keep the faith
When the storm flies and the wind blows
Go on at a steady pace
When the battle is fought and the victory's won
We can all shout together, we have overcome
We'll talk to the Father and the Son
When we make it to the promised land
If we walk together, little children
We won't ever have to worry
Through this world of trouble
We've got to love one another
Let us take our fellow man by the hand
Try to help him to understand
We can all be together
For ever and ever
When we make it to the promised land
Our bible reads
Thou shalt not be afraid
Of the terror by night
Nor the arrow that flies by day
Nor for the pestilence
That walketh in the darkness
Nor for the destruction
That waiteth in the noonday hour
