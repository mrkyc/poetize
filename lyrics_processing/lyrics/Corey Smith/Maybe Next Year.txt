But I'm still the same ol' son of a bitch in the wind
I act like I did back when I was a kid
But it hurts me more than it did back then
I go out on the town and make a fool of myself
I run around with the same rowdy friends
I get drunk and obnoxious
And wake up the next day swearin' I'm never drinkin' again
Yeah, my grandma still tells me
Enough is enough
Life ain't a game, son
It's time to grow up

Maybe next year, I'll start acting my age
Turn a new leaf over my wicked ways
Get a real job and start pullin' my weight
Only 365 days
Until I change my ways
I dress like a slob
I never tuck in my shirt
I let it hang over my baggy jeans
I wear an old baseball cap on the top of my head
With the logo of my favorite team
Still got the same dirty mouth that I've had
Since my first cousin taught me to cuss
And I just quit my 9 to 5 occupation
To play a whole bunch of songs I made up

But I ain't ashamed
'Cause when the time comes around
I know I can change
CHORUS
Maybe next year I'll quit blowin' all of the cash
Start working out and get off of my ass
Maybe next year I'll quit putting off all the chores
Maybe next year I'll visit my grandparents more
Maybe next year I'll go back to church and repent
Maybe next year I'll pick up my Bible again
I ought to straighten up
And there's no better time than now
To kick all the habits
That are bringin' me down
Maybe next year I won't be singin' the blues
Maybe next year I'll start telling the truth
Maybe next year I won't stay drunk all the time
Maybe next year I'll have a little more peace of mind
And maybe next year
I won't be so sad when I'm alone
