I'm a lazy thing
Not a marathon runner
But if I'm in a hurry
I can walk a twenty minute mile
I'm dirt cheap
I save a lot of money
But I'm a fashion statement that never goes out of style
I still drive the ladies wild

Yes I'm a flip-flop making a stand
On a sole made of rubber in the shifting sand
Feel free to tread on me
Honey, I'm just being all I can be
A little flip-flop and I won't stop
Rockin' the neighborhood

I slide right on and I slide right off
Take me or leave me but keep me from the garbage can
You'll want me here when the weather gets warm
When you're chilling in the swimsuit laying out working on a tan (yeah)
I'm your fair-weather friend, yeah baby

I'm a flip-fop dropping a beat
I'll save your little piggies from the hot concrete
Feel free to tread on me
Honey, I'm just being all I can be
A little flip-flop and I won't stop
Rockin' the neighborhood

I'm not a cowboy boot
A wing-tipped shoe or an elegant high heel
I'm not a heavy-duty work boot with a toe covered in steel
But I can take a whole lot of abuse, yeah, yeah
I can't go to church
I can't go out dancing
I can't have a nice diner
Can't take you to a Broadway show, no
The office place, it wasn't made for me
You can't make it in the rat race if you like to take it slow, no, no, no
The world's a big dress coat

And I'm a flip-flop making a stand
On a sole made of rubber in the shifting sand
Feel free to tread on me
Honey, I'm just being all I can be
A little flip-flop and I won't stop
Rockin' the neighborhood

I'm a flip-flop and I won't stop rockin'
