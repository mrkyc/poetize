The Lord works in a strange way
There ain't no doubt
Man he's gonna make a man of me
He's gonna straighten me out somehow

I was 27 years old that summer just having my self a ball
Working on a record deal playing in the bars and concert halls
Making money just to watch it burn, living day by day
Stayed out late drinkin' way too much, I . didn't act my age
But life turned on a dime when she said, you're going to be a daddy come wintertime
The Lord works in a strange way
There ain't no doubt
Man he's gonna make a man of me
He's gonna straighten me out somehow
The Lord works in a strange way
And Heaven knows
He's planning on a miracle
Man I wonder how it's gonna go
The Lord works in a strange way
Oh oh

Man I never saw the changes comin' they caught me unaware
One day I was as wild as a buck the next I was a teddy bear
Put down the bottle about a month before and I put down the cigarettes
Started holding my wife a little tighter and sayin' the prayers I used' forget
And now I look into those baby blue eyes
And I find all the peace I've been searching for, yeah I finally realize

The Lord works in a strange way
And it stirs my soul I'm holding onto a miracle and I ain't ever letting go
The Lord works in a strange way
I've finally made my peace with God and I've got sweet comfort in my soul

Man he's gonna make a man of me
A man of me
