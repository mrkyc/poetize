When I was only seventeen, couldn't wait for twenty-one
I'd hang around on Clayton Street in the bars there, gettin' drunk
A baseball cap and a fake ID would get me in the clubs
Then I would dance with the college girls and lie about who I was
I'd say, "I'm pre-Med, here at UGA, live on Milledge Avenue
I was raised over in Buckhead, I drive a BMW"
I was breakin' hearts and takin' names and numbers just for fun
Stealin' kisses, wishin' I was twenty-one

Thursdays came and the pocket change would quickly disappear
Upstairs at Lowry's Tavern, we'd pay a nickel for every beer
Shootin' pool, smokin' cigarettes with a dizzy head and a grin
At 4 AM on a school night, still hangin' out with my friends
One hour's sleep on a dirty couch, no shower, off to school
Smellin' just like a brewery with a bad hangover too
The teachers all would hassle me, "Stay awake, pay attention"
I was catchin' hell, wishin' I was twenty-one

The youngest one of all my friends, I didn't act my age
Too cool for the football games and the homecomin' parades
Now I look back and I have to smile 'cause, boy, it was fun
Bein' seventeen, wishin' I was twenty-one

And now I'm only twenty-six, feeling more like forty-three
My hairline's disappearing and I never get ID'd
My clothes are out of fashion, no, I'm not cool anymore
In the bed by ten o'clock each night and up at half-past four
Still, I go down to that college town when the Bulldogs play at home
I drink keg beer from a trash can 'til the whole damn thing is gone
Then I look at all those college girls, so innocent and young
