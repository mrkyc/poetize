Feels like a Friday night
But it's only Monday afternoon
Still there's a party goin' on in my livin' room
It's just me and fifth of Beam
Swayin' to the sounds of old George Jones
And it won't be long 'til the whole damn bottle's gone

And I know it might sound sad
But to tell the truth it ain't half bad
I love my misery
Gonna drown my blues in a sea of whiskey

I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin' in
Sure, it's a sin but I don't really give a damn
I'm drinkin' again
Oh, I'm drinkin' again

I've got no friends to call
They've all straightened up and settled down
And they don't ever wanna hang around
But I guess I understand
This house ain't much for company
Smells like a cesspool here
It's stinkin' nasty

And you might say I'm bad off
But I chose the road I strumbled across
I picked my poison
Give me another shot of bourbon

'Cause I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin in
Sure, it's a sin but I don't really give a damn
I'm drinkin' again

Well fortunately for me I find relief
When the world is weighin' down on me
I pop a top, I take a shot, I drop a pill
Turn the radio up, sit back and chill
Pretend my life is a bed of roses
Try not to notice all the ghosts
That are hauntin' me and tauntin' me
And wantin' me to cut my wrists
So they can watch me bleed
And laugh at me, as I scream in agony
I get high for the sake of my family
'Cause the alcohol is all that's helpin' me
To cope since I went broke and lost my hope
I kicked my girl to the curb of the road
You know I couldn't afford to support us both
Hell I'm not rich, don't have a good job
Do construction work with this dude named Bob
And he's an ass, Yells at me all the time
Pays minimum wage on overtime
Still he's got it made, drives an Escalade
And gets two hundred times what I get paid
But that's okay
I'll drink to his health and ruin mine
I'll chug liquor and he can sip red wine
And I'll be fine. Trying to find some peace
I'll quit payin' my rent and I'll break my lease
I'll live out on the streets and beg for change
Crawl in a box when it starts to rain
Forget my family and my friends
Forget the world, y'all, I'm drinkin' again
I'm drinkin' again
Tryin' hard to hide the pain I'm in
So don't give me any shit, I know just what I'm gettin in
Sure, it's a sin, but I done lost control
And I'm drinkin' again y'all
I'm drinkin' again
I'm drinkin' again
I done said goodbye
