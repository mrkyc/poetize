Best friends in a pickup truck, we were Panama City bound
Eight hours in the back, wind blowin' with the sun beatin' down
Makin' plans to raise some hell, celebratin' our senior year
I had a trash bag full of clothes and a suitcase full of beer
We got pulled over by the Alabama State Patrol
But they never found the booze, so they had to let us go

If I could do it again, you know I'd do it the same
Pass out on the beach drinkin' Golden Grain
I'd wake up covered in sand with that bottle in my hand
Then I'd go for a swim and start drinkin' again
I'd break all of the rules just liked I used to do
If I could do it again, yeah
Do it again

I met a girl from Tennessee, no I don't remember her name
But I can still see her top pulled down and that belly button ring
We kissed but I didn't tell, no, I had to keep it hush on the down low
I had girlfriend back at home and she didn't need to know
Sure I felt a little guilty as we dusted off our clothes
But she was wild and she was fine Lord, worth every lie I told
Aww yeah

If I could do it again, you know I'd do it the same
With the one night stands and the drinkin' games
You know I'd check out the girls at the clubs, hookin' up whenever I could
Sex on a beach never tasted as good
I'd break my first love's heart, forget to hide the fingernail marks
If I could do it again

I'd get sunburned on a new tattoo, lose my favorite jeans and my tennis shoes
Get kicked out of my hotel room and sleep in the truck for a night or two
Blow all my money, have to call my dad and work two months just to pay him back
Take bong hits and laugh like hell, flip the police off and get hauled to jail
If I could do it again I'd do it the same, not one regret I wouldn't change a thing

I'd check out the girls at the club, hookin' up whenever I could
I'd wake up covered in sand with that bottle in my hand
Aww yeah
I'd break all of the rules just liked I used to do
If I could do it again, how 'bout you
I'd like to do it again, Lord
If I could do it again, how 'bout you
I'd like to do it again, Lord
