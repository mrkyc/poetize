I've been down this road before
It's like the back side of my hand
And there ain't nothing up ahead
But cow pasture and timberland
So don't you worry baby I'm gonna take it nice and slow
I'll keep a tight grip on the steering wheel and my eyes on the road
Just this one time I promise I won't ask again
It'll be our little secret honey I won't tell a soul
And if I see somebody coming I'll be sure to let you know
Everybody does it, don't you be ashamed
We'll still make the movie, we'll just be a little late, yeah

Let me love you on a backroad
Let's make a reckless memory, yeah
There ain't a house within ten miles of here, no no
So nobody's gonna see
Take your seat belt off and climb on over here
But leave the driving up to me

If we get too hot and heavy there's a place where we could go
Down this worn out huntin' trail a half mile off the road
And we might not make it back there in this little two wheel drive
But judging by the way you're kissing me it's at least worth a try
I'll turn this Mustang into an F250 4x4
And if they catch us back there we'll probably go to jail
But I'd clear out my bank account and I'd gladly pay the bail
And I promise I'll still love ya, and maybe even more
I won't think bad about ya girl, I know you're not a oh Lord

But leave the driving up to me
Up to me

I'm rock hard, you're so hot
I think I'm turning blue
Come on baby please, you know I'd do the same for you, yeah

Let me love you on a backroad
Let's make a reckless memory, yeah
There ain't a house within ten miles of here, no no
So nobody's gonna see
Take your seat belt off and get a little comfortable
