Some days are better than others
Most are better than this
I can't remember what I did last night
And my girlfriend is pissed
She ain't taking my phone calls
She won't return my texts
I can't find my truck
All my cash is gone, and my T-shirt smells like sex

Woah, I'm back in the gutter, singing the same old song
I thought I could handle myself this time, man, I guess I was wrong
Why do I throw it all away, every single time
Right when I get back on my feet, I get drinkin' on my mind

I used to be so cool, made the parties all complete
Now I just look sad, when I stumble down the street
Folks like making fun, always pushing me around
You drunk ass fool, better check yourself, before we put you on the ground

Woah, I'm back in the gutter, singing the same old song
I thought I could handle myself this time, man, I guess I was wrong
Why do I throw it all away, every single time
Right when I get back on my feet, I get drinkin' on my mind

I been crazy, a young man in trouble
Took a wrecking ball to my life
And now I'm sifting through the rubble
No damage control, the the damage is done
All the bridges are burned and now I don't have any one
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a thief, and a fool
I take whatever I can get, yeah, that's my golden rule
Lord knows I tried changing but my will won't bend
I only hurt the ones I love in the end, friend
I stop and smell the roses but the roses stink
Life sucks unless I'm holding a drink

I'm gonna run back home to my momma, she always lets me in
Even though she told me a thousand times I couldn't come back home again
I'm gonna lock myself indoors, I'm gonna shake these demons loose
I'm gonna chalk all of my problems up to the alcohol abuse

Why do I throw it all away, every single time
Right when I get back on my feet, I get drinkin' on my mind
