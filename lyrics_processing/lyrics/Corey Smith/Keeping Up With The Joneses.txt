Back in the day back in the hills
We were busted
Made a living on the government's dime
Mama couldn't keep her job and the alimony check never came on time
We were poor, I wasn't proud
Only angry that our daddy couldn't send us more
Always embarrassed by my free lunch card
And food stamps for the grocery store

No keepin' up with the Joneses
No keepin' up with the Joneses
When your stuck on the bottom
You take what you can get
You say "Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh"

I went to school in hand-me-downs from my cousin
Baggy britches seemed to suit me well
Kinda thin and kinda loose in the middle
Slouching in after the tardy bell
The teacher never called me trash
But I knew what she was thinking when she looked at me
Born to be the underclass
Growing up to make a living on charity

No keepin' up with the Joneses
When your stuck on the bottom
You take what you can get
You say "Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh"

Don't go looking down your nose at me neighbor
I can spot you from a yard away
Don't try to judge me by the clothes I'm wearing or the cars in my driveway
I'm not rich but I'm not poor any longer
And I'm happy as a man could be
I'm proud to work, I'm proud to pay my taxes
And I'm grateful for my family

No keepin' up with the Joneses
No keepin' up with the Joneses
When you come up from the bottom
You love whatever you got
Say "Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh"
No keepin' up with the Joneses
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ain't nothing, ain't no one, gonna hold me down
Ain't nothing, ain't no one, gonna hold me down
Ain't nothing, ain't no one, gonna hold me down
