The holy rapture had already came and went
Left behind through hard times in bad lands where I belong
I thought about my loved ones and all of the things that I'd done wrong
There was no denying
I would be beaten by the chain of consequences
Ooh, I'm beaten by the chain
By the chain
Feels like I slip further from you every single day
It's getting harder to call your name when I bow my head to pray
And it's nobody's fault by mine
Nobody's but my own
All the doubts in my head leave no will to carry on
And they're multiplying
Every link in the chain of consequences
Ooh, I'm beaten by the chain
By the chain
And as the watch me fall
The angels cry
Because they understand my pain
And they've seen the blood spilled in the battles of my life
I'm in a leap of faith, racing through the sky
I'm like the tears that fall from angels' eyes

Polish up this rusty shell that I've been livin in
This life is a steppin stone
But I've fallen through the cracks
And I'm calling on you now to come and
Come and bring me back
Can't you hear me crying?
Help me break this chain of consequences
Ooh, I'm beaten by the chain
By the chain
And as the watch me fall
The angels cry
Cause they understand my pain
And they've seen the blood spilled in the battles of my life
I'm in a leap of faith, racing through the sky
I'm like the rain that fall from angels' eyes
I'm like the rain, oh
I said oh, I'm like the rain
I'm like the rain
