Girl I hate to hang out out to dry
With a bleeding heart and broken home
But I dropped this line to say goodbye
You Should have saw it comin', guess I was born for runnin'
And I can't pay the debts I owe
There's many a man lookin for me
I keep a pistol under my pillow
Feel I'm goin' crazy, I've been good for nothin' lately

Oh and when I'm gone, I hope you mention my name
I hope you care about the man
After you place the blame
Let our years turn to gold
And never wither away and be forgotten
I don't wanna be forgotten

Tell our boys that I'm real proud
I watched 'em grow up tough as nails
An there'll be no cryin' allowed
They'll know what to do
I'm sure they'll take good care of you
Kiss My baby girl goodbye
I'm sure she'll miss me most of all
I can't bare the thought of the tears she'll cry
She's so sweet and tender, Lord I pray she will remember

I'm takin the pick up truck, but I left a little bit of money
No it ain't to much but
It'll get you through the month ahead
I left my Browning Rifle and the old guitar my daddy gave me
Put 'em up and pass 'em down
Yeah, they're all I have to give
And maybe one day you can give 'em to my grandkids

I know its been hard lovin me
You've taken the scars and worn 'em well
And you'd starve yourself to feed this family
