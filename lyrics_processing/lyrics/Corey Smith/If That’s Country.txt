Straight out of Nashville, here's your next big star
He don't write the songs he sings, but he knows the words by heart
Wears a cowboy hat, and some tight blue jeans
And he struts around the stage like he's the coolest thing you've ever seen

Oh, you gotta love him

He looks like a supermodel and knows how to strike a pose
And he don't mind the makeup as long as no one knows
And he's got that crooked grin and talks with a southern draw
Acts like Toby Keith but sounds a lot like Tim McGraw

But if he's country I'll kiss your ass
Throw all my Willie Nelson records in the trash
He's the same ol' shit in a slightly different bag, aww yeah buddy
Oh, but if he's country well then country's pretty bad

I don't watch CMT, naw that shit makes me sick
And that ol' Kenny Chesney, what a hypocrite
He'll swear he's country, but lives in the Caribbean
Sings all about the islands now, well what happened to the Tennesseean?
See Corey Smith LiveGet tickets as low as $38You might also like
Oh if he's country I'll kiss your ass
Throw all my Johnny Cash records in the trash
He's all about image 'cause image pays the bucks
Aw, but if he's country well then country really sucks

What happened to the outlaws
Who weren't afraid to cross the line?
What happened to the working man
Who sang the truth about their troubled lives?

I was raised in Georgia, in a one red light town
And my daddy picked guitar in every honky tonk around
And he taught me all the good stuff
That solid country gold, but now I love it all, from hip-hop to rock and roll

And if I ain't country, well I don't give a damn
My daddy taught me to be my own kinda man
He said "Son you don't have to go along with the crowd, aw"
So if I ain't country well I'm pretty frickin proud
Oh well I don't need their labels anyhow
