Let me love you on a back road

I've been down this road before, it's like the backside of my hand
There ain't nothing up ahead cow pasture and timberland
Don't you worry baby I'm gonna take it nice and slow
I'll keep a tight grip on the steering wheel and my eyes on the road
Just this one time, I promise I won't ask again
It will be our little secret, honey, I won't tell a soul
But if I see somebody coming I'll be sure to let you know
Everybody does it, don't you be ashamed
We'll still make the movie, we'll just be a little late

Let me love you on a back road
Let's make a reckless memory
There ain't a house with in ten miles of here, I know
So nobodies gonna see
Take your seatbelt off, climb on over here, girl
Leave the driving up to me

If we get to hot and heavy there's a place were we can go
Down this worn out huntin' trail a half mile off the road
And we might not make it back there in this little two wheel drive
But judging by the way your kissing me it's at least worth a try
I'll turn this mustang into an F250 4x4
If they catch us back there we'll probably go to jail
But I'll clear out my bank account and gladly pay the bail
And I promise I'll still love you maybe even more
I won't think bad about you, girl, I know you're not a whore

I'm rock hard, you're so hot, I think I'm turnin' blue
Come on baby, please you know I'd do the same for you

Let me love you on a back road
Let's make a reckless memory
There ain't a house with in ten miles of here I know, know, know
So nobodies gonna see
Take your seatbelt off, get a little comfortable
Leave the driving up to me
