I got my sunglasses on
Yeah, it's all about the attitude
Like life's a long summer
And the world's just a big round swimming pool
Today I ain't in a rush
The water ain't going nowhere
So I'm taking it through a polarized lens
To soften the glare

The pavement gets hot
It's been burning my soul
So I'm sittin' on a ledge
With my legs hanging down in the watering hole

I could take a plunge, but hey why bother?
Everything looks fuzzy when you're underwater
I could hold my breath, but I ain't gettin' in over my head
I'm good right now, I'm just gettin' my feet wet (uh huh)
Gettin' my feet wet

Gently down the stream
Yeah, I'm keeping it cool
Like life's a lazy river
And I'm floating down it on an inner tube
Swirling around
Taking in the scenery
I hear the birds in the trees
And it sounds like they're all singing to me

I'm half asleep
But I'm wide awake
And everything in the scene seems more like a dream
With every breath I take

I could take a plunge, but hey why bother?
Everything looks fuzzy when you're underwater
I could hold my breath, but I ain't gettin' in over my head
I'm good right now, I'm just gettin' my feet wet

Yeah, I remember when
I'd jump in head first off the diving board
Hey daddy, look at me
Can you believe I don't need those wings anymore?

Learning to swim
It makes us brave
But the older we get
The more we sit back and let the kids make waves

I could swim like a fish, but hey why bother?
I got a drink in my hand, it's going down like water
I ain't afraid of drowning, but I ain't getting in over my head
Not today (ah uh uh)
I'm good right now
I'm good right now
I'm good right now
Getting my feet wet, yeah (uh huh)
