I can see who I really am and what
I'm meant to be
I'm not the one who's going to break you down
I will bring you back I have some things to say to you
I am reborn, I am the voice deep in your heart
Which shouts these songs not to let you go
We will survive this rat race honey
We will survive this
And I know that this won't be the last time
Cause people love to make same mistakes
Sometimes you need to distance yourself
To see things clearly
Ocean of thought's that could have been
Done a long time ago
But something still keeps me here
When you feel alone
I will be right next to you
Be right next to you
We will survive this
Take a seat my dear
Oh you don't have to be afraid
Everything's okay
I have some things to say to you
Every day is a new beginning and a new ending
You can't change anything by sitting back
Every day is a new beginning and a new ending
You can't change anything by sitting back
You live now, not in the past
Love is an anchor that holds me fast
Time to face your mistakes
You've held on for fucking far too long
Full of bitter grief and sorrow
Without a goal or guide to follow
Open the next page of tomorrow
And show them who are you
And I know that this won't be the last time
Cause people love to make the same mistakes
Sometimes you need to distance yourself
To see things clearly
Ocean of thoughts that could have been
Done a long time ago
But something still keeps me here
When you feel alone
I will be right next to you
When you feel alone
I will be right next to you
I will be right next to you
Fuck!
I will bring you back
Look past the paradox
The further you want to me away from me
The more you need me
Don't say anything
I will bring you back
Look past the paradox
I have some things to say to you
We will survive this
