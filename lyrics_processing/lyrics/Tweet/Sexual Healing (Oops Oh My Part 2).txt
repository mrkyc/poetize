I don't know if it's this drink or what
That got me thinkin' all kinds of crazy thoughts
About touchin' myself and wantin' myself
Lovin' myself, that's so nasty
I wonder what would happen if I didn't have me
Probably'll wake up satisfied and energized
The co-founder of do it yourself renaissance
Girl interrupted and Southern Hummingbird
Ms. Jade and Tweet 'bout to show you how a woman work

Perfect start (Ooh)
It was smooth sailin' (Oh)
I played my part (Ooh)
In this here relation (Oh)
I was blind (Ooh)
But I had new visions (Oh)
It's my time
Man, it's me you'll be missing, come on

Ooh, what is this feeling?
It's more than sexual healing
Ooh, tellin' me to go for 'self
And knowin' me, I gotta trust myself
Ooh, what is this feeling?
It's more than sexual healing
Ooh, I just gotta love myself, love myself

Now I ain't never been the freaky chick
But I'm feelin' kind of twisted
My shirt is lifted all up over my head, I'm slippin'
Phone is ringin', heart is beatin'
Lovin' what I'm seein'
Lookin' at myself in the mirror, tell me, what's the reason?
I'm lookin' to my left and lookin' to my right
Now I'm focused on myself again I know this ****
And the pressure keeps callin' me
Oops, my skirts gone
Caressing my skin
It's three in the morning
I keep on stallin', never did this before
I'm a grown-**** lady so what am I drawing for?
Give what I can give basically, that's what it is
Lights off, flipping the sheets, handle my biz, uh
Ooh, what is this feeling?
It's more than sexual healing
Ooh, tellin' me to go for 'self
And knowin' me, I gotta trust myself
Ooh, what is this feeling?
It's more than sexual healing
Ooh, I just gotta love myself, love myself
