I can sing about love lost
But what if there's no love to lose
If every day I saw sunshine and it
It never rained the blues
If my fear were tears I wonder
Could they fall
If a smile could stretch a mile even if
I had no money at all

But I'm willin' to take whatever life brings
'Cause you're the only one that seems to know me
And even if the bad times call
If I had your back, I wouldn't complain at all
I wouldn't complain at all

I could dream about tomorrow
Even if it's still today
I'd wear down my knees every night even if
I had no hands to pray
If my friends were dead and gone (Dead and gone)
Leaving me here alone
Could I depend on some spirit to ease me
But my soul's on its own

If my eyes were blind and I couldn't feel at all but see
Nothing in this world but you complete me
And even when the bad times call
If I had your back, I wouldn't complain at all
I wouldn't complain at all
I wouldn't complain at all
I wouldn't complain at all

Oh (Oh)
Come back to me
Ooh ooh

If you just wanna hang out with the boys
I wouldn't complain
I wouldn't make a fuss nor not a noise
I wouldn't complain
Leave your socks on the dresser and not in the drawer
I wouldn't complain
Just as well if you wanna watch your favorite sport, baby
I wouldn't complain (I wouldn't complain at all)
Change my way of living
I wouldn't complain (I wouldn't complain at all)
Show you much understanding
I wouldn't complain (I wouldn't complain at all)
For you (I wouldn't complain at all)
Promise I'll love you more
I wouldn't complain (I wouldn't complain at all)
Oh oh, ooh, I wouldn't complain (I wouldn't complain at all)
I wouldn't complain (I wouldn't complain at all)
Oh, come back, huh (I wouldn't complain at all)
I wouldn't complain (I wouldn't complain at all)
I wouldn't complain at all, oh oh oh oh
(I wouldn't complain at all)
I wouldn't complain at all, yeah yeah
(I wouldn't complain at all)
