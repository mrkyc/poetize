Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Why, oh why (Why)
Gave you several years of my life
And it just ain't right
What's your perception of love?
Now, how many times did we say it was over?
And how many times did we not leave?
There's no sense in this love hangover
Please come back to me

'Cause I can't forget your ways
I still remember our first kiss, oh
I'm nervous and tremblin'
Smoking cigarettes at night
Wonderin' where you've been
Smoking cigarettes at night
I can't cope with this
Smoking cigarettes at night
You're the one to help me quit
Smoking cigarettes at night
In the midnight hour
Late in the midnight hour

I see the edge of your face, ooh ooh ooh
And it makes it hard for me to breathe
What can I do to change your decision
Please work with me (Me, me), yeah
Sometimes my eyes won't close from weepin'
And sometimes I can't wake up from sleepin' (Why?)
'Cause you keep callin' me, keep callin' me in my dreams

I can't forget your ways
I still remember our first kiss, ooh ooh
I'm nervous and tremblin'
Smoking cigarettes at night
