Baby, you the man, 'cause you put it on me
And every morning, I roll over, feel you touching on me
I got another man but he ain't like you
And I can't be your baby mama though I'd like to
C-C-C-C-C-C-Call me real late at night
When my man's asleep and take a red eye
To the Westside, up and down my spine
And let you feel what you've been missing
I'm so bona fide
