Why'd you lead me on?
Where did we go wrong? (We go wrong)
Same sad song (Yeah)
Why'd you st-st-st-steer me wrong?
Puttin' crazy thoughts in my head
Put-put-put-put... puttin' crazy thoughts in my head
Puttin' crazy-crazy... crazy thoughts in my head
Put-put-puttin'... puttin'... puttin' crazy thoughts in my head

I remember what you said
When you were layin' my bed (Oooh)
Believein' every word you said
Puttin' crazy thoughts in my head
You painted a picture, so sweet I can taste (Uh-huh)
Lies undetected, not even a trace

Why'd you steer me wrong?
You kept me holding on
When you were already gone
Already gone
Why'd you lead me on?
Where did we go wrong? (We go wrong)
Same sad song (Yeah)
Why'd you steer me wrong?

Now, if a man only has his word
Then you would be speechless (Uh-huh)

Why I don't understand (Why'd youuu)

Why'd you steer me wrong?

(Ooh)
You performed a charade, yes, you did (Ah-ooh)
Lukewarm, a game you played with me (Ah-ooh)
From day one, I stayed
'Cause I thought you cared for me (Cared)
And I'm still wondering why (Ooh)
You performed a charade, yes you did (Ah-ooh)
Lukewarm, a game you played with me, yeah (Ah-ooh)
From day one, I stayed
