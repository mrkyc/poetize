I heat up and I
I can't come down
I swear I'm spinnin'
I'm on a merry-go-round
And I picked up a joint to my face
My heart beats faster than the regular pace
And I'm not sure what it is
I ask my mother to help me with this
And she said, "Daughter, you reached love jones
That's real lovin', so carry on"

Come to my place
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)
'Cause I really need you so
(You know i'll be waitin' for ya)
Be on your way
(You know I'll be waitin for ya)
And we can handle it real slow
(You know I'll be waitin' for ya)

You keep me thirsty, lickin' my lips
I'm hungry for ya to please my hips
And don't stop there, prepare to sweat
I'm gettin' hotter, and you ain't made it here yet
So won't you hurry, make no haste
'Cause you're the fruit I, I long to taste
And just in case (Case) I stop before ('fore)
You reach me first, I must adore
