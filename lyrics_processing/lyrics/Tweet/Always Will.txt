You keep telling me
That I'm way too sure
Of you loving me long time
Huh, but I bet you always will
In so many ways
I've rubbed off on you
And you've been loving me long time
And I bet you always will
We're inseparable
'Cause your soul's with mine
And you've been loving me so long
And I bet you always will, ooh ooh

We could be on separate planets
Mars and Venus, heart to heart
No space is between us
You know, you know (hearts don't lie)
I could stay here inside in this here city
And you go sail clear across the ocean
I bet you always will, yeah

You can't take away
And you can't forget (No)
That you've been loving me long time
And I bet you always will
You won't worry, no
'Cause it's evident
That you've been loving me so long
And I bet you always will, oh oh oh
