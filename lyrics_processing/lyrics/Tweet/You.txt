See, I was lookin' for a love to call mine
But instead I found you
(You, you, you-ouuuuu, oh-ohhh)
And it was just a true waste of my time
And lovin' we mess up (So)
But how come with you?

See, I was lookin' for a love to call mine
But instead I found you
(You, you, you-ouuuuu, oh-ohhh)
And it was juuust a true waste of my time
And lovin' we mess up (so)
But how come with you?
Sometimes I flip and ask myself why it had to be you
(You, you, you-ouuuuu, oh-ohhh)
But then I get a grip, it was all a lie
And love was so precious until I met you

I don't know why I saw a prize in you, youuu
Every night I close my eyes, oh it's alright
I lose my sight of you

Someone is bound to come along and do time
And do better than you
(You, you, you-ouuuuu, oh-ohhh)
And I won't be left alone, he'll love me for life
And surely not careless (No), selfish like you
How the strength in me has grown
And I realize I don't need you
(You, you, you-ouuuuu, oh-ohhh)
Disrespect you've shown, you can run and hide
But all of what happened will come back to you

Oh, I'm movin' on, yeah, yeah
Making a new start (A new start), yeah, yeah (I'm making)
I've lived a life
And surely, it won't be with you

I don't know why I saw a prize in you, youuu
Every night I close my eyes, oh it's alright
I lose my sight of you

I don't know why
