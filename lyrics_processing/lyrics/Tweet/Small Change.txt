Well, I thought about it

Well, I didn't think twice
No room left in my life for you
What did your world come to
But thank ya
Cause I made it through right into the light
And this here's not the last song that I'll ever write ,about ya
Goodbye, I wish you well, yeah
But this time you've lost your mind
Boy, can't you tell

You must be sorta deranged
Your worth is less than small change
To cry that to me is more than insane
Your worth is less than small change

Now that I've got my ish right without you
You come back inside with news
You want me to share my view
Haha, get that picture
Take a look and close your book that's my advice
Let's just be friends, that's better and it's quite alright
You got that
Look, here, there is no way
That I'm coming back and that's a fact
Don't beg me to stay
