Started out a boy that didn't know the game
But some many years I remained same
Use to be a love maker, heart breaker, major part player
Never thought that my heart ever change
Since then I have grown to know this much
What it really means to fall in love
But I don't know how I know I just know
Baby you're the one for me

Could it be (Could it be)
That I'm falling in love with you
Tired of the same old thing
And playing all the same old games
And if I could trade one thing
All in the exchange for you
Boy I give anything
Anything

As a little I was taught I was trained
Never trust in a man, cause they all remain the same
But you came along, and you
Brought out a little woman in me
And it's all in the things you do, yeah
Never thought I'd be here with the thought of loving you
But I claim it and I name it
Baby you're the reason I want a love brand new

Tired of the same old thing (The same old thing)

Girl I give anything
I give anything that I have for you

See I never had someone to hold me quit this close, oh-ohhh
And out of everyone of everyone I ever wanted
Seems that I want you the most
I can't deny you got me so high
I can't come down
