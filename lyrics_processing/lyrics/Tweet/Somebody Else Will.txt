Let me tell you how I feel
My man told me I should chill
I told my man, "Let me keep it real
If you can't love me, then I know somebody else that will!"
(New Tweet!)
Oh, now he all up in his feelings?
He ain't did nothing for me in a minute
I cut him off just like the end of a sentence
He seen me with somebody else, no more pretending!
(Let's go!)

Boy, you thought that I would never leave
I tried to compromise
I'm wondering, "Do you still love me?"
'Cause I don't see it in your eyes
I don't feel it when you hug me
Don't feel like you still love me
I'm all up in my feelings
I feel like it is something else
What am I doing wrong?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone!

If you don't love me, somebody else will
If you don't love me, somebody else will
This time around, I ain't crying no tears
Think I won't leave?  This time I will,I will
All right
All right
I'll be all right ,all right
If you don't love me, somebody else will
If you don't love me, somebody else will!

Oooo, I did my best that I can ever do
But you had too many demands
Sometimes I feel like I still love you
Can't let you keep it up again
I don't feel it when you with me
Feel nothing when you kiss me
It's like a brick wall and it hit me
What am I doing wrong?
And why I stay here?

If you don't love me, somebody else will
If you don't love me, somebody else will
This time around, I ain't crying no tears
Think I won't leave?  This time I will, I will
All right
All right
I'll be all right, all right
If you don't love me, somebody else will
If you don't love me, somebody else will!

(Shoo!) You don't say the sweet things that you used to say
(Shoo!) And now you're trying to treat me like your other babe
(Shoo!) I'm no part time lover, I'm your everyday
(Shoo!) You wanna hit the streets and go and head the other way
(Shoo!) 'Cause you gon' miss me when I'm gone
(Shoo!) I bet you feel oh so alone
(Shoo!) Boy I'm done crying so many tears
(Shoo!) If you don't love me, somebody else will!
If you don't love me, somebody else will
If you don't love me, somebody else will
This time around, I ain't crying no tears
Think I won't leave?  This time I will, I will
All right
All right
I'll be all right ,all right
If you don't love me, somebody else will
If you don't love me, somebody else will!
