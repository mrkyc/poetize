I was just a normal guy, life was just a nine to five
With bills and pressure, piled up to the sky
She never asked, she knew I'd been, hangin' with my wilder friends
Lookin' for some other way to fly

And three days straight was no big feat, could get by with no food or sleep
And crazy was becomin' my new norm
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor
And sleep right through the calm before the storm

My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

That Southern Baptist parkin' lot, was where I'd go to smoke my pot
An' sit there in my pickup truck and pray
Starin' at that giant cross, just reminded me that I was lost
And it just never seemed to point the way

As soon as Jesus turned his back, I'd find my way across the tracks
Lookin' just to score, another deal
With my back against that damn eightball
I didn't have to think or talk, or feel

My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

My whole life went through my head, layin' in that motel bed
Watchin' as the cops kicked in the door
I had a job and a piece of land, my sweet wife was my best friend
But I traded that for cocaine and a whore

With my newfound sobriety, I've got the time to sit and think
Of all the things I had, and threw away
This prison is much colder than
That one that I was locked up in just yesterday

My life is just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
Hell I can't even tell if I'm alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

I tell you, the high cost of livin'
It ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high
