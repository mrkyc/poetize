I never cut tobacco
In the hills of Tennessee
I ain't got a moonshine still
But I still love to smoke and drink
No, I never ate dinner from a wood-burnin' stove
Or rode bareback in a rodeo

You wanna see the redneck side of me

Give me a six string flat-top guitar
Put all you hillbillies in a honky-tonk bar
Show me to the stage, and set me free
And I'll sing all night and in the mornin' light
When your shades are on and your head's on ice
You'll know you've seen the redneck side of me
Let me tell you somethin'

I never was a roughneck
Pumpin' crude down the line
Aw and I ain't logged no timber
Sawn on them Georgia pines
I can't mix the best batch of etouffee
I never hunted gators in the Everglades

You wanna see the redneck side of me

Give me that six string flat-top guitar
Put all you hillbillies in a honky-tonk bar
Show me to that stage and set me free
And I'll sing all night and in the mornin' light
When your shades are on and your head's on ice
You'll know you've seen the redneck side of me

Aw, gimme that Gibson, Les Paul guitar
Put all you rednecks in a smoke-filled bar
Show me to that stage, and set me free
We'll raise hell all night, and in the mornin' light
When your shades are on, and your hat's too tight
You'll know you've seen the redneck side of me

Give me that six-string flat top guitar
Put all you hillbillies in a honky-tonk bar
Show me to the stage, and set me free
And we'll drink all night, and in the mornin' light
When your shades are on and your head's on ice
You'll know you've seen the redneck side of me
Son, you're gonna know you've seen the redneck side of me
