Daddy hugs his little man, says son I've got to go
And he pulls out of the drive and disappears
As they walk back in the house, the young boy asks his mama
Where does daddy go when he leaves here

Mama tells her little man, your daddy's got a job
And when he goes to work they pay him for his time
Well the young boy gets to thinkin', and he heads up to his bedroom
Comes runnin' back with a quarter and four dimes

And says mama how much time will this buy me
Is it enough to take me fishing or throw a football in the street
If I'm a little short then how much more does daddy need
To spend some time with me

The young boy tells his mama, now I know daddy's busy
'Cause most times when he gets home it's dark outside
But tell him I've got me some pennies, saved up from the tooth fairy
And I keep 'em in my piggy bank and I believe there's thirty-five

And mama how much time will that buy me
Is it enough to take me campin' in a tent down by the creek
If I'm a little short then how much more does daddy need
To spend some time with me

Mama how much time will this buy me
Is it enough for just an afternoon, a day, or a whole week
If I'm a little short then how much more does daddy need
To spend some time with me

Mama takes her little man, sets him on her lap
And starts dialin' up some numbers on the phone
She says daddy come home early, you don't have to chase that dollar
