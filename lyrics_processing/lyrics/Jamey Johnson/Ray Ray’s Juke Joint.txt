Well, I walked in to one of my old haunts
It used to be a honky-tonk heaven
Some ol' slicker done bought the place
An' lit it up like a 7-11
Yes, they fired the band that used to play
'Okie From Muskogee'
An' hired some dude with his hat on back'ards
Singin' hip-hop and karaoke

I should'a knowed it was gonna happen
Bein' this close to town
Aw but I know a beer joint back in the woods
That them city folks still ain't found

You make a right at the stump with the barbed wire in it
Where the old church used to be
Better mind that curve or the gravel gonna throw you
Right off in the Choctaw Creek
There's a one-lane bridge, just keep it in the middle
Pretty soon that road's gonna end
Welcome to Ray Ray's Juke Joint, down in the holler
Y'all come back again
See Jamey Johnson LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also likeMmm-hmm

They got ice-cold beer an' chicken an' ribs
Cookin' on the grill out back
Three plays for a quarter on the jukebox in the corner
An' it's full of Hank, Haggard, an' Cash
They got a long-legged waitress wearin' cut-off jeans
She's quick to take your order
Better leave her a tip but don't give her no lip
Y'all that girl is Ray Ray's daughter

They'll make you feel like family
An' everybody is your friend
But there's been folks messed up down there
That ain't never been seen again

You make a right at the stump with the barbed wire in it
Where the old church used to be
Better mind that curve or the gravel gonna throw you
Right off in the Choctaw Creek
There's a one-lane bridge, just keep it in the middle
Pretty soon that road's gonna end
Welcome to Ray Ray's Juke Joint, down in the holler
Y'all come back again

Yeah you make a right at the stump with the barbed wire in it
Where the old church used to be
Better mind that curve or the gravel gonna throw you
Right off in the Choctaw Creek
There's a one-lane bridge, just keep it in the middle
Pretty soon that road gonna end
Welcome to Ray Ray's Juke Joint, down in the holler
Y'all come back again
Welcome to Ray Ray's Juke Joint down in the holler
Y'all come back again

Aw, don't be scared
Nice place
