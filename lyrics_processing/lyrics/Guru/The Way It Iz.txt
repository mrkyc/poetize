Yeah (New York, New York), time to get up in that hit-ass (Brooklyn)
Uh, the rap savior (Representin', kid), ill behavior (Let's break it down)

This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg' 'cause it's my job to separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate

Your raps get bombarded, allahu akbar, baby pal, don't disregard it
Wanna be slick chicks, why you act so retarded?
All you pseudo-tough guys end up dearly departed, as a young juvenile I started
Learnin' from some older dudes, from the pimps to stick-up men
And back then you had to know the rules
The peer pressure, it can get ya
Knocked and locked-up or laid the fuck out upon a stretcher

This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg' 'cause it's my job to separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate

Peep the melody, Brooklyn is deeper than a felony
Raps are full of violence, who wanna challenge?
'Cause Kai rap whatever Kai choose to kick, a man's child from the Nile
Look at my style, ain't it raw? But too mature to be labeled wild
Ain't nothin' fake I create, I don't tolerate static
My brain'll cause drama like an automatic
So bang, I'm livin' large like a king, the addict
I'm kickin' pure mathematics with the power to rule
I give my knowledge as a tool and plus I'm invisible
And I apply by usin' my Third Eye, stimulation and high off the lye
And better yet, I'm a vet as I manifest, wise words from my breath
And my wisdom will flow until my dyin' day of death
With topics and subjects to every aspect, I bless the mic with intellect
You might also like
Don't pay attention, you'll get stuck, you're straight out of luck
'Cause niggas been beamin' you and they schemin' for fast bucks
While chickenheads be awestruck by the thugs
With ill mugs who act bugged and don't give a fuck
It's systematic when flippin' dough like acrobatics
Fiends and addicts gettin' served by cream fanatics
It's savage, Jakes more corrupt than we are
In the alley behind the bar, bringin' product from Panama and Bogota
Rulin' the game superior, the crime biz, the way it is in America
I'm killin' rappers like I've gone mad
My heat is righteous, too many brothers have gone bad

At times I lay in my bed holdin' my head, smokin' weed
Like a dred drinkin' liquor for dough, fact of myself, one question:
Yo, what's that, huh?
Why adolescents gotta get murdered to learn a lesson?
Stay on point with the joint in my Guess 'cause ain't no tellin' us
When slugs might touch my chest, feelin' like I'm blessed
Livin' life by the day, Monday through Sunday
Involved in gunplay, it's like a warzone, that's why I think with the chrome
And hold my own whenever walkin' these streets alone
It's like I walk on top of high heat with no shoes on my feet
Watchin' the flames get higher as the gun shots fire
This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg' 'cause it's my job to separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate

I'm supposed to give up guns 'til my probation is done
Still I'm waitin' for son to bring the three-eight long one
They try to deny what's happenin' to us
But nowadays it pays to be strapped ready to bust
Let's discuss, what would you do?
If you're confronted with jealousy, you at least get a twenty-two
Plenty of us go through this syndrome
It's better to fight than die poor and alone
The mob guys be gettin' loot for protection
They live and die for their profession

This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg' 'cause it's my job to separate the real from the fake
So I reveal the truth and break it down on a wax plate (Wax plate)

Yeah, we doin' it low budget environment style
It's like walkin' through the ghetto when the feelin' is fine
Everybody know the time, uh, East New York Style, uh
Yeah, East New York Style
This world is full of thugs, hustlers, big willie mobsters
I kill rappers on a reg' 'cause it's my job to separate the real from the fake (East New York Stye, uh)
