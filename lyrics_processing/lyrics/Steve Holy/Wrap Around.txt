In my favorite flannel shirt
Wearing her favorite bear slippers
She's so sexy that it hurts
And when i take her to the city
You should see her turning heads
They've never seen nothing so pretty
She can't help but knock 'em dead Yeah, yeah
She got a kiss that burns me down
She's got a touch that makes me come unwound
She's got a smile that knocks me to the ground
My baby's got the kind of love a man can wrap around
She's the perfect combination
Of Ginger and Mary Ann
Downhome sophistication
Ain't no lines in her tan
Sometimes she like to hear Bocephus
Sometimes easy-talk
But if you play la cucaracha
Well she'll dance until you
She dance until you drop
She got a kiss that burns me down
She's got a touch that makes me come unwound
She's got a smile that knocks me to the ground
My baby's got the kind of love a man can wrap around
