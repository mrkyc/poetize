But I wasn't drinkin'
It might have been the sunlight in my eyes
But it wasn't raining outside
It might have been a dream
But I wasn't sleepin'
All I know for sure
Is all I ever wanted
I saw in your eyes
It might have been the prayers
My mama prayed when I was young and trouble bound
It might have been the smallest crack in heaven
With God's grace fallin' down
Like a tiny drop of mercy
Of the greatest love of all
It watches over fools and little children when they fall
Maybe God just couldn't bear to see it when he saw
What might have been
Without your love
What might have been
If not for all my sins
I wouldn't know you saved me
And if not for my mistakes
I wouldn't know how right this is
I sure made a mess
Hell bent on my way
If anybody doubts a higher power
Look how your love stepped in
You might also likeIt might have been the prayers
My mama prayed when I was young and trouble bound
It might have been the smallest crack in heaven
With God's grace fallin' down
Like a tiny drop of mercy
Of the greatest love of all
It watches over fools and little children when they fall
Maybe God just couldn't bear to see it when he saw
What might have been
If not for love I might not exist
If not for love you couldn't love a man like me like this
It might have been the prayers
My mama prayed when I was young and trouble bound
It might have been the smallest crack in heaven
With God's grace fallin' down
Like a tiny drop of mercy
Of the greatest love of all
It watches over fools and little children when they fall
Maybe God just couldn't bear to see it when he saw
What might have been
Without your love
What might have been
Might not have been enough
Well it scares me now
