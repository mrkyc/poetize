I need a little space to think
Maybe we should start seeing other people
Baby, things are moving way to fast for me."
So, I, I picked up what was left of my pride
And I put on my walking shoes
And I got up on that high road
And I did what any gentleman would do..
I, um...
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
Flew out to LA for the weekend
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach
Wearin' nothin' but a smile
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'
Man, I think I'm on to somethin'
Because I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend
I love it when she calls me butter cup
She laughs and says I left the toilet seat up
She pops a top for me a cold beer
And says my buddies always welcome here
When I get hungry, she takes me out
I'm riding shotgun like a Shih Tzu hound
My tails a-waggin', my tongue's hangin' out
It makes me wanna shout...

Man I think I'm onto somethin'
You know I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend
Cute, cute, cute
She likes to write our names in the sand
She's hearing wedding bells and making plans
She's gonna hang around a while, I guess
And she hadn't even told me she loves me yet
I got a brand new girlfriend
We went and jumped off the deep end
We fly to LA for the weekend
Spend the whole day lyin; on the beach, wearing nothin' but a smile
Playing kissy kissy, smoochy smoochy, talking mushy mushy 'bout nothin'
Man, I think I'm onto somethin'
You know I feel just like a kid again
I got a brand new girlfriend
She makes me feel just like a kid again
