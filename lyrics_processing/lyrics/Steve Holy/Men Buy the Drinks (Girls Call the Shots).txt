He said baby sounds tempting but you know it ain't right, but
Eve was wearing one of those low-cut leaves, so
They shook that apple right off of that tree
(na na na na na na)
Ever since then it's been a battle of the sexes
In a game called love it's wife vs. ex's
Sometimes they let us when so we feel like we beat them but
Admit it fellas, they can go undefeated
'Cause it's a woman's world
Might as well face it
Yeah they got what we want and we're willing to chase it
Yeah it's a woman's world, boys like it or not
Men buy the drinks, girls call the shots
Us boys think we're smarter, i know that's a shocker
But once they start looking like the combination to their locker
All they gotta do is flash a schoolgirl look
Next thing you know, we're carrying their books
(na na na na na na)
Once they get a little older it's just more of the same
Just costs a little extra if you wanna stay in the game
But don't think for one minute boys that we're in control
They know we can't live without 'em, that's their ace in teh hole
