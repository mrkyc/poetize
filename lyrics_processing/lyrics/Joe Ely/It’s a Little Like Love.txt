'Bout what you said last night
When you wanted me to say in my own kind a way
What it was that our love was like
It's a little like a Daytime Drama
When the plot gets thick
You just never realized thru the turns and ties
That you was in the thick of it
It's a little like a Carousel
That's breakin' apart
And all the wild wild horses runnin ever which way
Runnin all over your heart
It's a Little like everything
This crazy world's made of
It's a little like a feelin' when your heart is reelin'
It's A Little Like Love
I don't know if I'm strong enough
To even hold on tight
I don't know if I can keep my poor eyes open
Baby till I see the light
It's a little like a Six O'Clock News
In the middle of your head
Both sides are a little hazy about which one's crazy
And what is better to be left unsaid
You might also likeIt's a little like a stock car race
You never stay in line
You just dodge flyin' steel and the rubber off the wheels
And try to make it to the finish line
It's a Little like everything
This crazy world's made of
It's a little like a feelin' when your heart is reelin'
It's A Little Like Love
I didn't buy no four week Course
I had to learn it on my own
Who ever wrote the book must've never took a look
At the seeds that they could have sown
It's a little like a thunderstorm
Lightnin' hail and rain
But when the clouds blow by there's a clear blue sky
To wash away all your pain
It's a little like a mountain climb
It's a long hard rise
If you make it up the hill then you know you will
See the sun on the other side
It's a Little like everything
This crazy world's made of
It's a little like a feelin' when your heart is reelin'
