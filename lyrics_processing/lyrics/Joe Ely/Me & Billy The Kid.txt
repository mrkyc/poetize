I didn't like the way he cocked his hat
And he wore his gun all wrong
We had the same girlfriend
And he never forgot it
She had a cute little Chihuahua
Until one day he up and shot it
He rode the hard country down the New Mexico line
He had a silver pocketwatch that he never did wind
He crippled the piano player
For playin' his favorite song
No, Me and Billy the Kid never got along
Me and Billy the Kid never got along
I didn't like the way he parted his hair
And he wore his gun all wrong
He was bad to the bone
All hopped up on speed
I would've left him alone
If it wasn't for that Senorita
He gave her silver and he paid her hotel bill
But it was me she loved and she said she always will
I'd always go and see her
When Billy was gone
Yeah, Me and Billy the Kid never got along
You might also likeMe and Billy the Kid never got along
I didn't like the way he tied his shoes
And he wore his gun all wrong
One day I said to Billy
"I've got this foolproof scheme"
We'll rob Wells Fargo
"It's bustin at the seams."
I admit that I framed him but I don't feel bad
Cause the way I was livin' was drivin' me mad
Billy reached for his gun
But his gun was on wrong
Yeah, Me and Billy the Kid never got along
Me and Billy the Kid never got along
But I did like the way he swayed in the wind
While I played him his favorite song
Now my baby sings harmony with me
To "La Cucaracha"
She winds her silver pocket watch
And pets her new Chihuahua
I moved in to the Hotel and got a room with a shower
We lay and listen to that watch tick hour after hour
Outside I hear the wind
Blowin' o so strong
