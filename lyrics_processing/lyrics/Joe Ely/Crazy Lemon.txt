They call me the Crazy Lemon
I'm crazy, wild, free for a while
I can't help what they think, I was born that way
I'll be a little crazy till my dyin' day
Just a man on the run, they call me the Crazy Lemon

It's true that I stole a Budweiser truck
I changed my mind, but the truck got stuck
In a muddy ditch so I hitched it back again
The second car that passed had a cherry on top
Just my luck, it was the first to stop
They said with a grin, looky here it's the Crazy Lemon

They call me the Crazy Lemon
I'm crazy, wild, free for a while
I can't help what they think, I was born that way
I'll be a little crazy till my dyin' day
Just a harlequin, they call the Crazy Lemon

Now I admit that I run a little illegal cargo
From the border and the coast, north to Fargo
Busted with a truck load of Juarez violins
Seems everything that I tried to sell
Just bought me a room in some iron hotel
Things were looking grim for the Crazy Lemon

They call me the Crazy Lemon
I'm crazy, wild, free for a while
I can't help what they think, I was born that way
I'll be a little crazy till my dyin' day
Just a man on the run, they call Crazy Lemon

It's true that I jumped a little bit of bail
From a handful of city and county jails
Seeking out a spiritual hideout in the wind
It's easy to hide from a 6 foot cell
No use tryin' to hide yourself
So play another hymn for the Crazy Lemon

They call me the Crazy Lemon
I'm crazy, wild, free for a while
I can't help what they think, I was born that way
I'll be a little crazy till my dyin' day
Just a face in the sun, they call the Crazy Lemon
Yeah, I'm the Crazy Lemon
