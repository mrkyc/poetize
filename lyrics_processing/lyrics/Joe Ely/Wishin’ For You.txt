All the street lights on Main Street know my shadow
All the stars up in the sky know all of my wishes
And the sidewalk on your street knows my footsteps
And the stars keep tellin' me I'm repetitious

I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do for yourself
So you leave it to somebody else
To keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do in a pinch
Honey, it's a cinch
I keep wishin' for you

All the boys down at the poolhall got my number
Some gal up in some hotel got my shoes
But I still got my last bottom dollar
Lucky me, I never lost more than I could lose

I keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin' for you
It's more than you'd ever do all alone
You can't wish on your own
I keep wishin' for you
You might also likeI keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin' for you
It's more than you'd ever do in a squeeze
It ain't nothin' to sneeze at
Wishin' for you


I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do for yourself
So you leave it to somebody else
To keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do all alone
You can't wish on your own
I keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do in a squeeze
It ain't nothin' to sneeze at
I keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do all alone
On and on and on
I keep wishin' for you
I keep wishin for you
I keep wishin for you
It's more than you'd ever do by yourself
So you leave it to somebody else
