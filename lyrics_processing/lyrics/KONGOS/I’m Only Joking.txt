Wadu-aidu-wadaidu...

There is a song, you're tremblin' to its tune
At the request of the moon
Lickin' her chops, she looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? I'm just a-fuckin' with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? I'm just a-fuckin' with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

And maybe the planets are tryin' to become the stars
And we really came from Mars
The earth is alive and man is a parasite
And heavenly bodies make us fight

I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? I'm just a-fuckin' with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
I'm only jokin', I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? I'm just a-fuckin' with your head
Only a crazy little thing I read
Only a crazy little thing I read

There is a song, you're tremblin' to its tune

Lickin' her chops, she looks at the lunatics
She needs another fix

I'm only jokin' (I'm only jokin')
I don't believe a thing I've said
What are you smokin'? (What are you smokin'?)
