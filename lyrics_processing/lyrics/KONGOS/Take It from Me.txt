It got a mind of its own and it say

I woke up, don't recognize the bed
Took me a minute to clear my head
I try recalling, but the blanks won't fill
Camera was rolling, but I forgot the film

(Take it from me)
When you start it's just a matter of time
Any minute you will cross that line
(Take it from me)
You never think about the price that you pay
It got a mind of its own and it say
(Take it from me)
Its got a mind of its own and it say
(Take it from me)
Its got a mind of its own and it say
(Take it from me)

Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you can slow me down?
Knock me off my track?
Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you could slow me down?
There ain't no turning back
You might also like
It don't take much for the beast to bolt
A split second too late to bring it to a halt
You're hypnotized, your feet follow your shoes
It's kinda like, a cigarette smokin' you

(Take it from me)
When you start it's just a matter of time
Any minute you will cross that line
(Take it from me)
You never think about the price that you pay
(Take it from me)
It got a mind of its own and it say
(Take it from me)
Its got a mind of its own and it say
(Take it from me)
Its got a mind of its own and it say

Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you could slow me down?
Knock me off my track
Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you could slow me down?
There ain't no turning back
Take it from me
Its got a mind of its own and it say
Nothing can stop me
Nothing holds me back
Think you could slow me down?
There ain't no turning back
Take it from me
