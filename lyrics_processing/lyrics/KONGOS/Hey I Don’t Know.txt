Tears are shed, a shame, I shoulda known
I shoulda thought, I coulda thought before I cast that stone
The waves radiate far and wide
There's a ringin' in my ears, for a minute, I think I'm goin' blind
(Hey)

Tears are shed, a shame, I shoulda known
The crown weighs heavy, heavy as I sit back in my throne
I say hey (Hey), it wasn't me, I'm just a pawn
But the devil's not into details, where have all the heroes gone?

Hey, I don't know, why don't you tell me?
Hey, I don't know, why don't you tell me?

The dream is broken
Now the mind must be woken
So what are you waiting for? Tell me, what's the hesitation?
What are you waiting for? Tell me, what is the delay?

Hey, I don't know, why don't you tell me?
Hey, I don't know, why don't you tell me?
Hey, I don't know, why don't you tell me?
Hey, I don't know, why don't you tell me?

The dream is broken
Now the mind must be woken
