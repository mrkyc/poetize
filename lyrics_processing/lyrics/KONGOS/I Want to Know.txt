What's it gonna take, are we gonna forever
Make the same mistake?
I wanna know, will you take a stand? Will you raise a hand
For your brother's sake?
You talk about the deluge, you talk about centrifuge
You got something to prove, tell me
Whose eyes you gonna use?

And I, yeah, I
What's it gonna take? (What's it gonna take?)
And you, yeah, you
What's it gonna be? (What's it gonna be?)

I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know

What's it gonna be, got another theory
You want me to hear?
Takin' your refuge in your reason just to beat the fear
That we don't know why we're here
Even cold hard facts have got a way of changing
Their stripes in the light of a new day
The world we hold so tight and true
Turn it on its head, oh-oh-oh-oh

And you, yeah, you
What's it gonna be? (What's it gonna be?)

I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know


Livin' under pretense, always on the defense
Always on the fence
Tell me
What's it gonna be? Yo

And I, yeah, I
What's it gonna take? (What's it gonna take?)
And you, yeah, you
What's it gonna be? (What's it gonna be?)
