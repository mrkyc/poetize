I'll kick and scream before I try
And not remember that I will die
Because I'm happily asleep
And I still don't understand
I think I've met myself before
But I shut my eyes and closed the door
Now all I do is sleep
And I still don't understand

The trouble is I've lost myself
The trouble is I can't find my way
I'm standing here and I'm all alone
And what I know I don't understand
The trouble is I've lost myself
The trouble is I can't find my way
I'm standing here and I'm all alone
And what I know I don't understand

And then he says as he starts to smile
You've been lost for quite a while
Because you answer first and you question last
You can never find the truth that fast
And then he says as he starts to laugh
It lies between the future and the past
And he asks me why if I knew it all along
Waste my time and write this song
Then he shouts as he starts to fade
You want it all but you never pay
Now I'm standing here alone
Searching for my tone
You might also like
I don't know how and I don't know when
I saw the path and felt the end
I walked away and did not fight
And now I see the fading light
And all I have is this one day
This one moment is the only way
But all I do is sleep
And I still don't understand

The trouble is I've lost myself
The trouble is I can't find my way
I'm standing here and I'm all alone
And what I know I don't understand
The trouble is I've lost myself
The trouble is I can't find my way
I'm standing here and I'm all alone
