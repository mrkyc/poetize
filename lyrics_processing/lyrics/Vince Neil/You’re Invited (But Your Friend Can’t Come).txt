Little woman got that look in her eyes
Want to cut me down to size
Show me what you're gonna do
It's true
Who's that gorilla standin' by your side
Oh, no, it must be your ride
You wouldn't be with such a fool
Or your mama too

There's something over here I want you to see
There's a party but it isn't for three
Get something straight between you and me
Because...

Whoa, no, you're invited but your friend can't come
Whoa, no, no, come on, baby, gonna have some fun...wow

Heartbreaker, yeah, you came for the show
But little did you know
You'd end up in the spotlight
Well, alright
Come on baby, won't you show me what you got
Ready or not... one, two, here we go
Oh, no...

Nobody's watchin' now it's time to decide
Shake the monkey, mama, don't be shy
Come on honey time to take a little ride
Because...

Whoa, no, you're invited but your friend can't come
Whoa, no, no, come on, baby, gonna have some fun...
Whoa no, you're invited but your friend can't come
(said your friend can't come)
C'mWoah, no, no, come on, baby, gonna have some fun

Rock the night like a hurricane
Make me sweat like the drivin' rain
Pour it on till I can't get no reaction
It's gonna be your night tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
Scream and shout, I need it now
Now! Now! Now, now, now, now!

I'm making plans for the rest of the night
So tell your guard dog that he'd better not bite
My dogs are bigger and they're ready to fight
So come on, come on, come on, give it up tonight!
Whoa, no, you're invited but your friend can't come
Whoa, no, no, come on baby gonna have some fun
Whoa, no, you're invited but your friend can't come
(said your friend can't come)
Whoa, no, come on babe, we're gonna have some fun, yeah
We're gonna have some fun
We're gonna have some fun
We're gonna have some fun, baby
