My travelin' shoes
I've got a long way to go, a long way to go
And I've no time, I've no time to lose
Well there's a road that I haven't seen so hand me down my travelin' shoes
There's a road that I haven't seen so hand me down my travelin' shoes
Hand me down
My walking cane
I've got a long way to go, a long way to go
Moving like a wind
Up and out across the plains
Well there's a town that I haven't seen, so hand me down my walking cane
There's a town that I haven't seen, so hand me down my walking cane
And when the sun's upon my shoulder, I will wash within its light
Through the years as I grow older, I'll take comfort from the sight
Of a young one's eyes, early morning skies, just one tiny bird taking flight
Hand me down
My driving wheel
I've got a long way to go, a long way to go
Moving on, moving on these tracks of steel
Well there's a place that I haven't been so hand me down my driving wheel
There's a place that I haven't been so hand me down my driving wheel
You might also likeAnd it's a restless kind of burning that drives me up around the bend
And like a child I'll keep on learning till my time is at an end
And I'll fade away, and you will hear me say, I'll say softly to my friends
Hand me down
My travelin' shoes
I've got a long way to go, a long way to go
And I've no time, I've no time to lose
It's just a place that I haven't been so hand me down my travelin' shoes
Just a place that I haven't been so hand me down my travelin' shoes
