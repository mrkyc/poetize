You gotta travel light, or leave a lot behind
You're just breezin' through, buddy buddy just breezin' through
You run a lot of roads, you see a lot of towns
Some'll get you up, and some'll bring you down
But you see it all when you're movin' it down the line
When you're moving it down the line
You meet a friend or two, you leave a friend behind
That's the way it goes, buddy buddy that's the way it goes
Looking for the music up over the hill
Feeling like you're nothin' but standing still
Oh, that's the way of things when you're moving it down the line
You got a one armed bandit upon your back
He says drop another year and I'll pay you back
But those old triple-sevens never ever seem to come your way
From the second floor window of an old old hotel
You hear the early morning traffic and the village bell
And you find yourself singing like a sparrow at the break of day
You got a one armed bandit upon your back
He says drop another year and I'll pay you back
But those old triple-sevens never ever seem to come your way
From the second floor window of an old old hotel
You hear the early morning traffic and the village bell
And you find yourself singing like a sparrow at the break of day
