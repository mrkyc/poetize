That a man can't help but feel;
There a shadow growing longer now
And nipping at my heels
For I know that soon that old four-lane
That runs beneath my wheels
Will take me home to my sweet Wyoming home
I headed down the road last summer
With a few old friends of mine;
They all hit the money, Lord
I didn't make a dime
The entrance fees they took my dough
The traveling took my time
And I'm headed home to my sweet Wyoming home
Watch the moon smiling in the sky
And hum a tune, a prairie lullaby;
A peaceful wind, an old coyote's cry:
A song of home, my sweet Wyoming home
The rounders they all wish you luck
When they know you're in a jam
But your money's ridin' on the bull
And he don't give a damn
You might also likeWell there's shows in all the cities
The cities turn your heart to clay;
It takes all a man can muster
Just to try and get away
And the songs I'm used to hearing
They ain't the kind the jukebox plays
And I'm headed home to my sweet Wyoming home
Watch the moon smiling in the sky
And hum a tune, a prairie lullaby;
A peaceful wind, an old coyote's cry:
A song of home, my sweet Wyoming home
And now, I've always loved the riding
There ain't nothin' quite the same
And another year may bring the luck
The winning all the game
But there's a magpie on the fence rail
And he's calling out my name
And he calls me home to my sweet Wyoming home
And watch the moon, it smiling in the sky
And hum a tune, a prairie lullaby;
A peaceful wind, an old coyote's cry:
A song of home, my sweet Wyoming home
