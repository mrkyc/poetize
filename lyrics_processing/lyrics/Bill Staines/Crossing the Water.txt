We are making a passage that is straight and true
Every heart is a vessel
Every dream is a light
Shining through the darkness of the blackest night
Oh we are crossing the water our whole life through
We are making a passage that is straight and true
Every heart is a vessel
Every dream is a light
Shining through the darkness of the blackest night
For there is no shallow water, and naught but love to keep
Us safely from the dangers and the devils of the deep
And with every breath within us
We search forever more
To find some peaceful harbor on that far-off shore
And we are crossing the water our whole life through
We are making a passage that is straight and true
Every heart is a vessel
Every dream is a light
Shining through the darkness of the blackest night
For some it is a glory, for some it is a game
For some it is a story filled with of emptiness and pain
But as rising winds in chorus
We search for steady ground
There is only that before us, there can be no turning 'round

We are making a passage that is straight and true
Every heart is a vessel
Every dream is a light
Shining through the darkness of the blackest night
Oh there is no other journey that will ever be the same
No second-chance horizon that will call you by your name
When the welling waves wash o'er you
And stormy winds they drive
Give your heart a song, sing it loud and long keep your dreams alive
And we are crossing the water our whole life through
We are making a passage that is straight and true
Every heart is a vessel
Every dream is a light
Shining through the darkness of the blackest night
Oh we are crossing the water our whole life through
We are making a passage that is straight and true
Every heart is a vessel
Every dream is a light
Shining through the darkness of the blackest night
Oh, every heart is a vessel
Every dream is a light
