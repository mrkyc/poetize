Their bright sails are flashing for Mexico
I wonder if someday they'll ever know
As they sail on the deep blue sea
As they sail on the deep blue sea
He used to sit on the cliffs as the sun went down
Waving his arms like some colorful clown
Calling to the seabirds flying down
Over the deep blue sea
And he sang:
The boats they come and the boats they go
Their bright sails are flashing for Mexico
I wonder if someday they'll ever know
As they sail on the deep blue sea
As they sail on the deep blue sea
Some thought he was crazy 'cause he said he could fly
Some thought he was dangerous from the look in his eye
At the most he's just a character constantly high
Singing by the deep blue sea
And he sang:
The boats they come and the boats they go
Their bright sails are flashing for Mexico
I wonder if someday they'll ever know
As they sail on the deep blue sea
As they sail on the deep blue sea

His white beard's never seen around
But children still recall the sound
Of music by the sea
And they sing:
The boats they come and the boats they go
Their bright lights are flashing for Mexico
I wonder if someday they'll ever know
As they sail on the deep blue sea
As they sail on the deep blue sea
Some thought he was crazy cause he said he could fly
He just leaned into life as it went on by
And like a sail on the wind oh it carried him high
Over the deep blue sea
He sang:
The boats they come and the boats they go
Their bright sails are flashing for Mexico
I wonder if someday they'll ever know
As they sail on the deep blue sea
As they sail on the deep blue sea
Yes I wonder if someday they'll ever know
As they sail on the deep blue sea
Yes I wonder if someday we'll ever know
