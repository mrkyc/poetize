Wiz press the button, whatever what bridge
Yo' Wiz press the button down with ya' nose
Play i'm a need a little more energy from you, Ok
Ladies and Gentlemen, Martin Lawrence, Boo, ha-ha
Here's Martin Lawrence's first video
Eh, visit to a recording studio
And his last...

Toe to toe Kid 'n Play's on a roll again
It's only right we keep the crowd dancing
Rhymes are dope, the tempo is steady
You ready, lets rip up the floor like confetti
Cause we never fess or front
When its time to get hyped on the mic
Or a fly dance tip
Paid to entertain ya'
Never short change ya'
But if ya run out of breath it means danger
Now I seen a lot of kick step impressionist
But i'm not impressed
So I guess it must be a diss
Get it together
We might seem soft, but we ain't having it
Kid 'n Play get taken out
I can't imagine it
Set the record straight as arrow
I see a lot of dancers
But the floor is narrow
So Wiz give me a scratch and drop the beat
And check the meters
So we can show em' who's the dance leaders
We're letting you know, we're ready to go, so get up
Thought you was hot played with fire, got lit up
Rhyme for rhyme, step for step, show to show
Kid 'n Play's ready to go
Toe to toe
You might also like
Kid the mic master
Dance professionist
Split, drop, twist
Like a gold medalist
Even though legendary as a might be
Suckers wanna try to kick step all over me
First I ignore em' and try to be cool about it
But here I am at a club
Man its too crowded
Back up chump better give me 10 paces
Gonna let you know who's running this stage
It's Kid a dope crowd pleaser
Been dancing since my high top fade was a caesar
You try to diss i'll get destructive
Walk in with the bubble, man
I'm gonna bust it
One by one wack dancers i'm calling off
Yo' Play see anyone over here falling off
I did'nt think so, he tried to wink yo'
Ain't nobody here taking my rank so chill
Or you're gonna force my hand
On the floor prepare for some torture, man
Just kicking it in stereo and in video
Thats how you know we're ready to go
Toe to toe

Play's gonna settle the score
Cause i'm a floor wrecker
You can't give more cause you a poor stepper
Watch me shift gears
Here's an example
The original tramp is gonna trample, hard
Prepare to get scarred
I wear a medium
C'mon play you know you large
Now that may well be
But my mind tells me
To step with Pep each time I hear a bell see
DJ Wiz conducting like a band leader
That boys a maneater
He makes the jam sweeter
Toe to toe, lets throw, like a slugfest
And when we're done we'll see who cuts a rug best
Sulfuring, letting nothing stop ya'
Just slamming and jamming, like the phantom of the opera
Out of the blue coming through like a champion
After the house party
The boys still tramping
Competion done it's automatic gift
You got beef or wanna start static
With the brothers with the high note cameo
Thats how you know we're ready to go
