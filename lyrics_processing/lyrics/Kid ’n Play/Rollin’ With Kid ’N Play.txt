Rolling, rolling, roll with Kid 'n Play now (Now, Play)

I don't know what it is
About this beat that we have here, but it sure is funky
Oh-la, oh-la, ayy
Oh-la, oh-la, ayy (Yo, Kid)
I don't know what it is
About this groove, that's here making us move, but it sure is funky
Oh-la, oh-la, ayy
I think its time to rap, shall we? Surely

Kid 'n Play back rolling strong, dope and def
We can get funky with the best, we're just
Hyping it up, you know, just how it had to be
Just take a look around, boy, can't you see?
Guys are bum rushing, girls are just blushing
Wiz rocks the scratch while Hurb's on percussion
Setting the stage for the stage to get set off
I'll bust a rhyme and a dance, so just jet off
So get off because you bit off more than you can chew
Now watch the dynamic duo
Do a little go-go thang, come on, rock and swing
Ya gotta roll with Kid 'n Play, now everybody sing

Rolling, rolling, roll with Kid 'n Play now
Rolling, rolling, roll

Now we're the stars of stage, wax and video
We're here to tear it up, so come on, here we go
Pump it up, this is high-powered stuff
Kid 'n Play can't get enough
Of that funky go-go-go rhythm
You wanted a dope jam? Well, that's what we're givin'
We're heading for fame because Kid 'n Play's driven
Boy, we no game and large is how we're living
We stay paid, you know the boys have got it made
See, I'm the tramp and the fella with the hi-top fade
Get down to the sounds, you know we're 'bout to turn it out
Roll with Kid 'n Play, everybody shout

Oh-la, oh-la, ayy
Oh-la, oh-la, ayy
Rolling, rolling, roll with Kid 'n Play now

Oh-la, oh-la, ayy

Rolling, rolling, roll

And we present ourselves as the very best
On the microphone we bring light to your soul
Your whole damn body we will control
So stay calm, don't get alarmed
Gonna relax you ladies with our deadly charm
Gonna go to work on you fellas, too
Make you wanna do the things we do
'Cause when, uh, Kid 'n Play is in your town
Ya gotta keep rockin' to the go-go sound
Ya gotta keep rockin' all day, all night
'Cause we're a different delight, dynamite on the mic
So shake it, your butt, shake it down
We got the best music all around
