The duo's back in effect
In a house party set
Catching wreck on a mic check
Before we tear it up I turn and
Give my partner a high five
Cause it's time to get LIVE

So when I say make some, you say noize! Make some
Noize!
Make some
Noize!
When I say make some, you say noize! Make some
Noize!
Make some
Noize!

Well it's the Kid from Kid 'N Play
Now that's a rap group
I'm not that sup but I'm living phat troop
You looking that cute
The girl in the cat suit
In my black coupe rhyming on all of the fat loops
Oops!
Feeling good, pop the tape in the tape deck
And I'mma catch wreck, then catch a fat check
Check, what the heck? Grab the mic for a mic
Check right before your eyes equalize
With the cruise next, who's next?
Who's gonna flex with the hype rhyme?
I think it's my time
I'm flowing like a pipeline
Going for the right sign
Gonna have a fine time
Name up in here, like Diego in prime time
Trying to score a touchdown
Trying to make a slam dunk
Bringing out a fat chunk
Cause the track is mad funk
Niggas try to say I never gave back
Get ready for the payback
This a house party black

So when I say make some, you say noize! Make some
Noize!
Make some
Noize!
When I say make some, you say noize! Make some
Noize!
Make some
Noize!

P to the L-A-Y in the place to be
What's the matter brother? Didn't ya hear me
See! I'm the man that ya heard about
The fly dark-skin brother that the girlies spread the word about
And when you wonder why I get sexed more
You get bets more
Cause I'm the boy next-door
And when ya smile and grin
And then I go up in
And in a hour later I'm at it again, friend (Come on now)
And then I'm ready to go
But you don't hear me though (Ready to go)
And I'm about to throw just like Redbone
I keep an even flow watch as I do the show
And I'mma flip it and kick it like Jeter (Come on, come on, come on)
So don't try to say that I can't when I can pull
Watch me trample this hip hop sample
The choice is yours black:
You can either catch a cap or get slapped
Or sing the chorus jack
So when I say make some, you say noize! Make some
Noize!
Make some
Noize!
When I say make some, you say noize! Make some
Noize!
Make some
Noize!

Knock knock, ya gotta let me in
Cause I know ya got alligator skin
Underneath of your chin
And I only must pick a roughneck nigga
Check 'em in a sec just ta see who's bigger
The Left never ever did expect to flow it
When I say it's time to get it up
I know he can't show it
And if he make a mistake, he'll never get it
Stupid motha-what yaah
But if my hat is to the back
Then ya can sort of say it's crooked
As I look the only nookie
Gets a roughneck rookie
Jump a hump-a-rump-bump
On the back, hit the front
Take a dump in a stump
Roll a big fat blunt
And if he's quick to hand it to ya, don't grab it
He only really want it
If he know he can't have it
Chase a roughneck bet you'll say "dagnabbit
Mr. Fudd we will Neva catch that Wuffneck-a Wabbit"
So when I say make some, you say noize! Make some
Noize!
Make some
Noize!
When I say make some, you say noize! Make some
Noize!
Make some
