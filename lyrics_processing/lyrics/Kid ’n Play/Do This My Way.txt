The time is hype,you wish for; that you've been real good when your part of a "kid n' play" adventure
You've been praying,saying you want more;
The time is hype,you wish for; that you've been real good when your part of a "kid n' play" adventure
I think it's time to make the floor burn;
What i'm saying is, it's your turn;
To do things you always wanted too;
Here's the jam,we ain't playing you
Listen to what i'm saying here;
Work it out,or you ain't staying here
Troupers or troupettes ya know this;
Listen close,don't blow this chance
To get next to the opposite sex;
It means.....
...If your not down,use the exit
Just like bud-dish;
We always do this;
On the stretch y'all,we can do this my way
You might also likeThis sympathy;
Was composed by me;
Know you rest's at jeopardy
Like the kiss of death to my foes;
MC's all fallen like dominoes
Oppose me;
You must be a little crazy;
Gonna unleash the sounds and the furry;
Hook-up;
The Mic real quick;
It's a habit i just can't quit;
And when i'm though getting loud,the crowd will be of ecstasy;
Rush the stage to get next to me;
Let me pick the girls giving sex to me;
It's time to collect my feet;
Play's by my side;
Rip it;
Run it;
Stick it;
Gun it;
The boy's just stunning
Herb don't instruct this;
Where's the trumpet?;
Give me the beat and i'll pump this my way
Now i'm here to rhyme;
It's time to slay;
You heard the kid,now it's time for play;
Rocking the beat's her program;
It makes no sense 'cause i'm so damn def;
And i can diss not ever;
There's no fuss;
Its just me endeavor,stating,debating;
None of that;
In my domain, i'm the captain;
Think your'e hot?Light the match;
Then pray as the DJ start scratching;
Kid n play with the rep,notorious;
Take a step. Why don't you just;
Get on the floor?;
The rhyming past your door;
So hype,you want to crash your door;
In;
'cause play's at it again; behave;
I'm about to begin and do it my way
Its kid n play;
Devising a scheme;
Yo,herb! show 'em what we mean;
Confused by the words we saying?;
Were not serious;
Were only kid-n-playing!
Two guys. are we shy?;
Bull!;
Like a tower,were an eye full;
They say we couldn't rap;
Said we were a phase,man;
How 'bout a trace;
Herb and the base men.;
Play was stamped a long time ago;
And i was tramped before the video;
You lose ya breath,i'm def,and even though;
Ya try to fight;
Ya can't;
So here we go
The kid is ready to do this;
I'll look at play and he'll say....
We can do this,boy;
Clap your hands,this jam is a can't miss;
