Mind blowing decisions
Causes head on collisions

Love ya' girl and that's straight from the heart
And I promise you girl i'm gonna do my part
I got ya' in this mess
And you can lay it to rest
To be responsible yo'
I kick it the best
My hole life is through
A 9 to 5 I pursue
To be ready for the time you're due
Say what, nah
I would of done it anyway
Cause what's right is right
And it don't pay
To leave you like this
Just holding the pad
Now now, stay calm girl, yo' don't get mad
I know it's my fault
I thought I was covered
The heat, the rush of girl, I was smothered
Sorry first, I've come to run
Don't point a finger
Cause what's done is done
"alright miss, time to get back to your cell"
How bout' it love
Yo' please don't tell

Now to understand this you must understand that
Women are more sexually active than they act
Some are blunt and other take their time
It takes a real super lover to read between the lines
8 out of 10 are serious nymphos
Here's the example that made me think so
Picture this, you and a young miss
Talking about things that both of you miss
Its an open conversation
Feel free to speak up
Then after a while things start to heat up
You ease up and even start to freeze up
When she touched ya' butt
And like a true mac man, you know what's up
But it's cool with you
Maybe she just being friendly
You had enough to drink, she had plenty
Normally you take advantage
But this is an exception
You're the best man at her wedding reception
Take her to the park
And do what, that cross your mind
"but the guy that's getting married
We've been friends along time"
What am I gonna do she's gorgeous


Yo he's running, running
Gotta get away
Attacked because of race
"or maybe he's gay"
I see pipe, "shades" a glare of a blade
Then an alley "a dumpster"
Will that be his grave
Flashes of his life he's already lived
"20 minutes now"
Will his mob ever give?
Keep pushing "pushing"
Gotta survive
Is this a bad dream
"can he open his eyes"
Ah, but no, he feels the real pain of his 
"it's raining" cold "sneezing" coughing
Once last chance to resort to subway
Who's to say this way
"is not an escape way"
"lost em' phew, a sigh of relief"
Ayo' punk
"except the guy who's started the beef
No weapon of his own"
A blade at his face
"spun around quick and picked up a new pace
A train is coming"
Can he make it across
"made it, free his troubles are lost"
Yo'
"not yet the kid's still on his trail"
Yo' help
"the guy yo' he's stuck on a rail"
That's it
"outta of here man he's gone
