Been driving all night
It's stuck in my mind
Running through lights
All I can find
Is lonely in a crowded room
But I don't wanna leave too soon
In case I miss someone like you

Lay out my goodbyes
I'm done for the night
Saw you outside
Had the look in your eyes
Falling in a deep unknown
Getting late, I have to go
I can't leave, I have to know

Get into my car, get into my life
Get into my heart, you know what I like
Come give me something that I won't know how to live without
I don't wanna miss and I can't let this get past me now

You figure me out
They're talking me down
Your love is so loud
And it's drowning them out
Voices in my head again
Where you start is where they end
Now they're gonna wanna let you live, yeah
You might also like
Get into my car, get into my life
Get into my heart, you know what I like
Come give me something that I won't know how to live without
I don't wanna miss and I can't let this get past me now

And I, and I, and I've got my head spinning (spinning)
And I, and I, and I feel like I'm winning (winning)
And I, and I, and I've got this feeling (feeling)
That you and I, that you and I will just keep driving

Get into my car, get into my life
Get into my heart, you know what I like
Come give me something that I won't know how to live without
I don't wanna miss and I can't let this get past me now

I just wanna drive
I just wanna drive
I just wanna drive
I just wanna drive, drive, drive
