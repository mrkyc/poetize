How this gets so serious
I was just a little curious
Now I'm afraid this is dangerous
I drive hundred miles an hour
There's a first time for everything
This is a place that I've never been
I can feel the adrenaline
I drive hundred miles an hour

Is this the feeling they sing about?
Put on the brakes but can't slow it down
I don't know how this love should go
But if it's just like the radio

Then I'll be watching every breath you take
And if you want a pretty wicked game
'Cause all I've got to go off
Are lessons from a love song
Why don't you tell me our sweet little lies
So I can die here in your arms tonight
'Cause all I've got to go off
Are lessons from a love song
You might also like
Since we were lovesome
Lessons from a love song

This new air feels hard to breathe
Is this how it's supposed to be?
If sweet dreams are made of these
Then why can't I be sure if

This is the feeling they sing about
Put on the brakes but can't slow it down
I don't know how this love should go
But if it's just like the radio

Then I'll be watching every breath you take
And if you want a pretty wicked game
'Cause all I've got to go off
Are lessons from a love song
Why don't you tell me our sweet little lies
So I can die here in your arms tonight
'Cause all I've got to go off
Are lessons from a love song
Baby, this time we'll write our own song
And maybe someday somebody learns from
Where this is heading, we'll never know
But if it's just like the radio

Then I'll be watching every breath you take
And if you want a pretty wicked game
'Cause all I've got to go off
Are lessons from a love song
Why don't you tell me our sweet little lies
So I can die here in your arms tonight
'Cause all I've got to go off
Are lessons from a love song

Since we were lovesome
