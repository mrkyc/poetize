Are we going insane?
Do we need to explain?
I feel like we know it
Am I doing it right?
Cause when you show me that candle light
I don't wanna blow it

Coming in, let me know if you like it
Show me you like it, show me excited

I can lose it all, it won't be daunting
Somehow I don't think I'd even care
Cause every time I'm with you, I feel wanted
We could make believers if we dare, yeah

There is so much at stake
Hearts too soft to break
But we don't need to go there
(You and I)
Cause we're like summer and rain
(Summer and rain)
You and I are not the same
(We're not the same)
That's what makes it perfect
