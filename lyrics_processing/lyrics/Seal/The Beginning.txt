The beginnin' saw existence of a chosen dream
But then came pain
With energy strikin' on those she knew would uncover her lies
She knew she must destroy everythin' that we had prayed for
So she sent shameful claim in her lies
She wants us to be what's going on in her mind

Music takes you 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and
Round
Hold on to the love
Hold on to the love
The music takes you 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Hold on to the love
Nah, nah, nah, nah
(Hold on to the love)
(We are smiling)

She wants us to be what's going on in her mind
If she is to take over she must prevent unity
But oh, how cold her life must be
She knows she must destroy everythin' that we had prayed for
So here comes shameful claim in her lies
