You would know from their faces
There were kings and queens
Followed by princes and princesses
There were future power people
Throwin love to the loveless
Shining a light cause they wanted it seen
Well, there were cries
Well, there were cries of why
Followed by cries of why
Followed by cries of why not
Can I reach out for you if that feels good to me?
CHORUS
And the riders will not stop us
Cause the only love they'll find is paradise
No, the riders will not stop us
Cause the only love they'll find is paradise (paradise, yeah)
Mm, don't you know that racism in among future kings
Can only lead to no good? (to no good)
Besides your, sons and daughters (sons and daughters)
Already know how that feels, one day
One day (One day)
All the queens will gather round
Spreading love and unity so we can be found
Well then all the riders say it's all to do with drugs
So inject me
With your love
Inject me with your love, all right
