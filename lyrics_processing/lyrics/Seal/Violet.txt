Don't worry, come closer
Don't cry
Ah, don't cry
Ah, don't cry
Ah
(Get moving or I'll kick your ass)
Ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-da

Oh, I watch you comb your hair in different light
You change the chair and seem to think that's alright
I understand, you need a change
So when you make that change
Don't look to see I'm alright

Now that I look at you in different light
A violet unicorn, to me that's alright
I understand, you need a change
And when you make that change there
The world will elevate you
And if I told you then that I could cry
Would you take my tears and wash the sunrise?

A man afraid has no shame
So when you take those tears
Don't look to see I'm alright
When you take those tears
Don't look to see I'm alright
Well, how can I tell you?
How can I explain?
I want your love and I need a change in me
Ba-da-ba ba-da
Ba-da-ba-da

Why should they come?
They were supposed to die back there
But I didn't, for the second time
Don't worry they'll come
They know
Do what?
That I'm not like anyone else?

Suddenly
You and I will wait
In your dreams
Suddenly
You and I will wait
In your dreams
Tonight night
We'll finally change
You and I will wait
And maybe time will tell
All over

All over
All over
All over
You and I will need a
You and I

To start all over again
Oh, babe
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Will be their brighter day?
Be their brighter day-heyday-hey
All over
All over
All over
We'll finally change
With a lesson
With a lesson
Oh and oh no
Why do they do that?
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Why do you want to do that? No-one else ever has
Because no one else ever has
You've got no fear of communists when they're finished(?)
They have only killed him for questioning
Don't be too fond of Christians

I've got to go to the hospital
The guy has taken me in
Give it to me
Please, let me quit
Oh go on
Just don't leave me here
Ah, whether he thinks this might be helpful
Can you go back when he was evaluated?
Charlie was evaluated in July
His heart valve was causing him a problem
I know, that's why I don't understand it
Well, if one of them thinks that it says symbiosis

Loving Chile there's
Always something new
Always something new
Always something new
Always something
Always something
Darling, yeah, there's something
Always something, always something
Soaking wet?
