Yeah, yeah

Just like bums, we used to stay in the slums of LA by the way
Gang-bangers killin' each other for rep, sellin' rock cocaine on my doorstep
Had a ball to bounce, bike to ride, but my mama never would let me play outside
But when I got enrolled in elementary school, started bangin' like a fuckin' fool
So cool, throwin' up gang signs to the gangster beat, shot an enemy from across the street
Mama came home, said she got a good job. Daddy did too. Now they don't squab
Financially, we improvin'. 2 months later, son, we movin'
No more duckin' from shotgun shells. Bought a two-story house in East Palmdale
(give it to me now.)

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(Check it out, check it out, check it out.)

No more rats and no more roaches, livin' next door to football coaches
Now I got a new place to sell me crack. Now I got little white kids to jack
I stopped wearin' blue, wasn't trippin' on red. Too busy squabbin' with the skinheads
Stupid questions, distract the class. Rubbin' little girls all on the ass
I didn't really care if I passed or failed, figured I was headed for the NFL
Until the playoff game, shoulder got hurt. I thought about my future, layin' in the dirt
I can't jump, I can't flinch. Superstar player, ridin' the bench
Graduate from school? Don't make me laugh. I got an F+ in basic math
(give it to me now.)

I knew I couldn't make it in the corporate world, so I bought me some khakis and a Geri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL, went to East Palmdale and started slingin' yayo
For sure! I was makin' crazy dough. Should've dropped outta school a long time ago
Bought a cell phone, like a nut. Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I drunk whisky and Bacardi. I sold weed to anybody
Me and my homies sold dubs and dimes, took turns bustin' rhymes just to pass the time
Police drove up to my spot. Asked, "Hey, homeboy, what you got?"
I put a fat rock inside his hand. About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van

Palmdale, (Hell, yeah) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out, check it out, check it out.)

Now I got a fucked up life. Five bad kids and a naggin' wife
Dead end job at the airport. Check too short to pay the house note
Turn on the TV, then I see different homeboys that went to school with me
Playin' in the NFL. We used to kick back in East Palmdale
Rodney Williams. Lorenz Tate. Zeno plays for Colorado State
I wish my homeboys much success, but at the same time, I still get depressed
Walkin' through the wind with a cup full of gin thinkin' 'bout things that could've, would've, should've been
I wipe my tears, sip my beers, wish good luck to my peers from
Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began
Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

Oh yeah, oh yeah, all the Palmdale Falcons, past and present. All the little ones I don't even know, you know what I'm sayin'. Everybody, wherever you're at, aye, aye, aye, aye
