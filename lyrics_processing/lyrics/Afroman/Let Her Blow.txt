Welcome to Palmdale, California
Thanks for coming to  liquor store
If you can't afford to get in the club
You can always buy some Colt 45, stand out here and drink
I'd be happy to sing it to you
Fellas, don't go psycho
When she's on her menstrual cycle
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
Maxi pads are frightful
But orgasms are delightful
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
After she blows my wad
I hate to go out in the storm
But when I think about what she just did
My hard-on keeps me warm
If that pussy ain't popping
Get her head to bopping
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
See Afroman LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also likeI wonder if Miss Morgan
Will suck my reproductive organ
If her cycle has to flow
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
Well it feels so good I'm crying
Everywhere sperm is flying
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow...
After she blows my wad
I hate to go out in the storm
But when I think about what she just did
My hard-on keeps me warm
If you can't stick it
Kick back and let her lick it
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
If there is no pussy pounding
You might find her lips astounding
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
I accept trainees
Get down on your knees! (Gotta learn, gotta learn)
If you can't fuck the hoe
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
After she blows my wad
I hate to go out in the storm (it's cold out there)
But when I think about what she just did
My hard-on keeps me warm
Fellas, don't get mad
Let her change her maxi pad
If you got her head down low
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
Hey, when she gets real grumpy
Give her something lumpy
Since you can't fuck the hoe
