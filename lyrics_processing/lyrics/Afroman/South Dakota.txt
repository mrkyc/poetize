I tried to fuck a girl from Sioux Falls
But she text all night, and gave me blue balls
A dick teaser skeezer from the city of Mitchell
You never gave me the pussy, you bitch you
Rapping to the girls in Rapid City
But they left rapidly, what a pity
Almost got a blowjob in Pierre
But she said I have too much pubic hair
I took my Blackwood to Whitewood
Didn't go quite good I got a room in Deadwood
The receptionist said she's from Lead
But she won't come up and give me no head
I told her let's drink and smoke on this
Maybe later I can spear your fish
She denied all of my urges
Just like all the pretty girls in Sturgis

I'm beating my meat at the hotel in South Dakota
Such a lonely place
No women on MySpace
I'm beating my meat at the hotel in South Dakota
Any time of year
Can't find no pussy here

I thought I had a winner when I was in Winner
But baby girl wouldn't let me go up in her
I met a feminist from Vermillion
She said she wouldn't fuck me for a million
I got some bookings in Brookings
But the girls were not foo-king
Tried to dick your daughter down in Watertown
But it was too many cock blockers hanging around
I thought I had a queen in Aberdeen
This rejection is fucking up my self esteem
Rush me a whore to Mount Rushmore
I really don't wanna jack off no more
All the hot girls in Hot Springs
Get mad when you discuss hot sexual things
Imma get me some pussy, it's not too late
Imma fill my gas tank and get out of this state

I'm beating my meat at the hotel in South Dakota
Such a lonely place
No women on MySpace
I'm beating my meat at the hotel in South Dakota
Any time of year
Can't find no pussy here
I'm beating my meat at the hotel in South Dakota
Such a lonely place
No women on MySpace
I'm beating my meat at the hotel in South Dakota
Any time of year
Can't find no pussy here
What's up, South Dakota?
I love y'all, man, I love y'all weed
I love all my fans
Imma just run down to Nebraska, Iowa, get me some pussy right quick, Imma be right back
You know what I'm sayin?
No hard feelings, just a hard dick
