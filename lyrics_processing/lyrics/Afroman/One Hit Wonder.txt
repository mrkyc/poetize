As, I hit the bong
I wonder, what went wrong
With my mainstream hip hop fans
As, I toke along reminiscing
Weed we smoked on all day
And all night long
I'm the rap star Afroman
(My song fell) off the charts and I feel the pain
Wishing I wouldn't rack my brain (Wonder why you playing)
2 Chain and Little Wayne
I wonder
Why-why-why-why-wonder
Why, is it because I got high
You don't think I'm fly
Call me one hit wonder
Curse me to the day I die
One hit wonder, I hit the blunt and just wonder

How can I be just a one hit wonder
83 albums, hitting like thunder
You think 1 hit is all I got
But I play 90 minutes or a 3 hour slot
1 hit that's 1 song
The average song 4 minutes, 20 seconds long
Explain how I entertain for hours
Drunk and hot, supernatural powers
Afro fans would act a fool, if I don't sing hits like "Back to School"
I get complaints from my fans, if I don't sing hits like "Tall Cans"
Afroman you suck, if you don't sing "She Won't Let Me Fuck"
I might have to fight, If I don't sing "Lets Get Drunk Tonight"
I can't leave alive if I don't sing "Colt 45"
Colt 45 and two zig zags, baby that's all we need

Afro, Afroman, sing "I Live in a Van"
Come on don't be no wussy
We wanna hear "In Your Pussy"
Afroman, I'm bomb as hell, I wrote songs like "Palmdale"
Leave the stage they yelling no
They wanna here hits like "Sell Your Dope"
Hush, the crowds callin my name
Hits like "Hush" bring me fame

Encore, yes indeed they like my hit song "Tumbleweed"
I made another hit for yah, "Just My Paranoia"
Your party is live, but my party is live-er
When I say "Colt 45-er"
The gangster, the frat boy and the Hippie
Wanna hear that hit song "Mississippi"
Pass me the spliff, I wrote a hit song called "Graveyard Shift"
Everywhere I go people make a fuss
I wrote "Back on the Bus"
They pay me green baby, know what I mean baby
I wrote that hit song, I'm a "Dope Fiend" baby
