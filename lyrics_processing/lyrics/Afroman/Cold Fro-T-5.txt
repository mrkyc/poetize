Light that up man whats happening, uh hah!

Cold Fro-T-5, Cold Fro-T-5
(Baby) Cold Fro-T-5
We going to the park after dark
And smoke that tumble weed
Cold Fro-T-5, Cold Fro-T-5
Baby, (Yeah) Cold Fro-T-5 (I love ya baby)

Well it's fro twentie and I gots to drive
Through my neighbourhood  for some Cold Fro-T-5
What love for a hustler, liquor store briefing
Move quickly everybody beefing
Cold Fro-T-5 two zig zags
Two car  with expired tags
Liquor store empty getaway parking just in case bullets start barking
I flirt with the fine hoes then I  crack jokes with the wineo's
I know where the Cold Fro-T-5 is at in and out like that 20 seconds flat
Money on the counter buy this warm I can get shot if you take too long
I ride it around the corner and throw it in park fo the sheriff swim up like a shark (Nearr)
Close the gate and hope out the car
Start back selling my caviar
Whats up my plastic cup my stereo turned all the way up

Cold Fro-T-5, Cold Fro-T-5
Baby, Cold Fro-T-5 five (Hell I love ya baby)

Rough expression on my face
Why do I like that nasty taste
Maybe it's why I like to buzz
Don't get who you is or who you was
I like to cruise the avenues
When smoking weed and having brews
Let all four of my windows down
Pound the ground with my OG sound
I got warrants and the shit ain't fun
When you getting handcuffed on a liquor store run (Goddamn)
Got pretty women every one
And a brother can't help but stop
And stare at eye's lips, teeth, hair, breasts, thighs, dairy air
If she do or don't reply, I still feel good walking by

Cold Fro-T-5, Cold Fro-T-5
Baby, Cold Fro-T-5
We going to the park after dark
And smoke that tumble weed
Cold Fro-T-5, Cold Fro-T-5
Baby, (Yeah) Cold Fro-T-5 (I love ya baby)
Remember that night I seen your dog
Drunk ass hell in senior frog
Hug my neck shake my hand
Smoke that blunt with Afroman
Hit that bong, play my song
Put it on repeat all night long
It went platinum overseas and gold in the states
Got a new album with hella tour dates
Got my own label Mr. Mix-On-The-Turntables
Of if your a true fan you can go Facebook dot com backslash OG Afroman
Eighty-three shady g you too k my Facebook page but I took your lady with me
I rap the best I rap west I even took money from the IRS

Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Just wave your hands in the air
And wave it like you just don't care everywhere
Just wave your hands in the air
And wave it like you just don't care everywhere
If your not going home till your drunk and high

Oh yeah (Oh yeah) Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Let me hear you say 'smoke marijuana, smoke mari-marijuana' (Smoke marijuana, smoke mari-marijuana)
