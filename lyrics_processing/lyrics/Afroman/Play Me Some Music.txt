Hattiesburg, Mississippi, 'member Jefferson Davis
The Confederate guy that used to enslave us
If you don't, it's cool
But I went to his elementary school
Pop lockers, break dancer, rap masters
Free slaves walkin' 'round with the ghetto blasters
What the hell is that noise?
Beat boxin' performed by the Fat Boys
I took out the trash, I mowed the yard
I studied hard, got A's on my report card
Mom and dad at the pad told me, "Way to go"
Went to the sto and bought me a radio
All you old school hip-hop vets
Remember radios with the two cassettes
I shut the door, let the bass boom
There's a party going on in my room

Play me some music
When my money's low
And I don't have
Nowhere to go
Play me some music
In the ghetto
Whatever problems I have
I'ma just let go

Playing friends with my friends in a dark blue beanie
Five minutes of funk funk with Whodini
Had fun bumpin' Run-DMC
The cops, you better fuckin' run like me
Kept buying tapes, built my collection
Rub my chin, then I make my selection
BDP, Ice-T, Eazy-E
Then one day, I thought, "Perhaps"
I grabbed a pen and write my own raps
Filling the mic, filling the mic
Killing the mic, killing the mic
Better than, better than
Any rapper you like, any rapper you like
I got high, then I dropped out of high school
Because I got high, now I'm rich, fool
I hang around rich fools
And their bitch rules
When I switch shoes, I never thought I would lose
My daily music because of greed
More money than what I need, indeed
Oh well, what the hell hoe, turn the beat down
And talkin on the cell phone
Hang up, who the fuck is callin' next?
If I don't talk then I gots to text
Remember back in the 80's
All you needed was a pager for the ladies
Post-Y2K, way more stress
A cell phone, a slave GPS
I used to think having cellphones was cool
But people wanna call
While I'm jammin', fool
Try to make money, fighting with my wife
Music snuck out my life
Try to play music when I get the chance
Gained so much weight I can hardly dance

Play me some music
When my money's low
And I don't have
Nowhere to go
Play me some music
In the ghetto
Whatever problems I have
I'ma just let go

Broke out my CDs
Play that, play that, play this, play this
Make me a dope ass playlist
Turn the bass up, punk, don't be no goof
No auxiliary, use the Bluetooth
I live in the woods, so don't come around
Hell no, I won't turn my music down
Went to Best Buy, bought a stereo
Plugged it in to the wall, now here we go
So if you get a phone call, turn it down low
Take it outside, y'all
I used to play music, befo' I got rich
Now I talk on the cell phone and fuckin' bitch
I see you phone call, I decline and refuse it
Fromie don't play that shit
