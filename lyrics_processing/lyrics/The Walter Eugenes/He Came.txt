And when the earth was fire
And the bones were in the mire
And with the sun aglow
And with the moon full of snow
And when the stars were bright
And when the night looked like fire in the sky
And when the day was found
The day the earth was spinning round
He came, he came

He came, my passion fire
He came, my burning heart's desire
(All the love)
He came with all the love
He came with all the love
He came, he came, he came

And when the earth was green
And when the sun made the rain, the snow
It made the flowers start to grow
And all the fish were born
And all the birds in the trees
Were like the flowers to adorn
And from the mountaintop
The rocks came rolling to the valley low
And like the waterfall goes crashing
To the earth below
Into the river, into the sea
He came
You might also like
He came, my passion fire
He came, my burning heart's desire
He came, he came
He came with all the love
He came with all the love, he came
He came, he came, he came, he came
He came to light the night
He came, my fire burning bright
To warm the day, to warm the night
He came with all the love
He came with all the love, he came
To warm the day, to warm the night

"He came to light the night
He came, my fire burning bright"

And from the earth they came
To breathe the breath of life
It was a man and his wife
And from their unity
Would come a sacrifice
A man would give his life
That man would give his life
Oh, that man would pay the price
Jesus would lay down his life
And from my passion fire
He came, my burning heart's desire
He came, he came
He came with all the love
He came with all the love, he came
He came, he came, he came, he came
He came to light the night
He came, my fire burning bright
To warm the day, to warm the night
He came with all the love
He came with all the love, he came
He came, he came, he came

He came to light the night
He came, my
He came, my passion fire
He came, my burning heart's desire
He came. he came with all the love
He came with all the love
He came to light the night
He came, my fire burning bright
He came to warm the day, to warm the day
He came to warm the night
He came with all the love
He came with all the love
He came, he came
To light the night
