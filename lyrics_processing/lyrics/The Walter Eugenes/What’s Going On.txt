Hunger for power, hunger for gold
Hungry men die hungry and cold
I'm only human, what's a man to do
I'd steal you blind if I got to choose
If I got to choose

Root of evil, grow on my land
Root of evil, you're bittersweet
Just a little honey, just a little honey
And root of evil, you taste so sweet
Root of evil, you taste so sweet
Root of evil, you taste so sweet
Root of evil, you taste so sweet
Root of evil, grow on my land
Grow on my land

If a million people
Sent a dollar bill
They'd never feel it
But I surely will
And if a million people
Sent me their money to spend
They'd never feel it
But, oh I'd feel it again
I'd feel it again
I'd feel it again
I'd feel it again
I'd feel it again
I'd feel it again, yeah hey
I'd feel it again
I'd feel it again
I'd feel it again
I'd feel it again, yeah hey
Yeah, hey, hey
