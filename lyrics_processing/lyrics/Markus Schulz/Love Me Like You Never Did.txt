I wanna feel my heart turned up so loud
Oh-oh, oh
Like a Phoenix rising, never coming down
No, oh
Wrapped in this moment, I don't want to quit
Arms up to Heaven 'cause if this is it
I wanna give it all
I wanna give it now
Oh, oh

If this is how it ends
Let's go out on fire
Burning with your arms around me
Oh-oh, oh
When the lights go out
We'll know that we've lived
I want you to love me, baby
Love me like you never did
Won't you love me
Yes, love me like you never
Love me like you never did
Come on, love me
Yes, love me like you never
Love me like you never did
You might also like

Won't you love me
Yes, love me like you never
Love me like you never did

I know we've done a lot, but we can do much more
Oh-oh, oh
Is there a side to you I've never seen before?
Oh-oh, oh
Wrapped in this moment, I don't want to quit
Arms up to Heaven 'cause if this is it
I wanna give it all
I wanna give it all
Oh-oh, oh

If this is how it ends
Let's go out on fire
Burning with your arms around me
Oh-oh, oh
When the lights go out
We'll know that we've lived
I want you to love me, baby
Love me like you never did
Won't you love me
Yes, love me like you never
Love me like you never did
Come on, love me
Yes, love me like you never
Love me like you never did

Oh, when the lights go out
We'll know that we've lived
I want you to love me, baby
Love me like you never did
Won't you love me
Yes, love me like you never
Love me like you never did
Ooh, ooh, ooh
