In the quickness of our haste
It seems we forget how to live
The old blueprint no longer manifests itself
As the correct way to exist
So wipe the grime off the view hole
And please take a closer look
Environmental bandits up to their shenanigans
Crooks disguised as crooks disguised as...

We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
(The world go 'round, world go 'round)
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
(World go 'round, world go 'round)

Individual roles we think
Not so important to the plot
The big picture unseen, leaving life in between
Destroyed and overwrought
There's no need to point the finger
We understand who takes the blame
Delinquents caught red-handed in the act
Crooks disguised as you and I
You might also like
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
(World go 'round, world go 'round)
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
(World go 'round, world go 'round)
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
(World go 'round, world go 'round)
And yeah, I'll find another way
(World go 'round, world go 'round, world go 'round)

You see, there's many, many, many, many people in the world
(From end to end, from pole to pole)
And I'm not sure if I like what I've heard
(Far and near, far and wide)
I'm not sure if I like what I'm doing myself
I'm not sure if I like how the world turns, how the world turns
Oh, degradation, great big word (Big word)
I'm in violation, oh
Unexcusable (Exploitation) exploitation
It's the dawning of a new era
People consciously don't care
How unfair

And find another way to make the world go 'round
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
Yeah, yeah
And yeah, I'll find another way, oh, oh
And send me another way, hey
And find another way to make the world go 'round
World go 'round, world go 'round
You got to send me another way
In the quickness of our haste, we forget
In the quickness of our haste, we forget how to live
(Find another way to make the world go 'round)
So find another way to make the world go 'round
