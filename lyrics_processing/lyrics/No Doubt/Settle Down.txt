Get in line, and settle down

What's your twenty?
Where's your brain?
Checking in to check you out
Concerned about your whereabouts
Copy that, you're acting strange
So tell me what is going on
So heavy I bet

I'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)
I'm hella positive for real, I'm all good no
I'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)
It's gotten complicated that's for sure

But you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
And I really mean it this time
And you know it's such a trip
Don't get me started
I'm trying to get a hold on this
Get get get in line, and settle down
Get in line, and settle down

No big deal (I can handle it)
It'll bounce off me (I can handle it)
Been around the block before
Doesn't matter anymore
Here we go again (are you kidding me?)
Are you insane? (are you kidding me?)
Underneath the avalanche
So heavy again

I'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)

And you know it's such a trip

Get get get in line, and settle down
Get in line, and settle down
I'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough
And nothing's gonna knock this girl down
I'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough
And nothing's gonna knock this girl down
I'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough
And nothing's gonna knock this girl down
I'm a rough and tough, I'm a rough and tough

But you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips
