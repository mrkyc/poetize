Go ahead and look at me
'Cause that's what I want
Take a good look, won't you, please?
'Cause that's what I want
I know you wanna stare
You can't help it and I don't care
So look at me
'Cause that's what I want

Do you think I'm looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
How is this looking on me, looking on me?
Do you think I'm looking hot?
Do you think this hits the spot?
How is this looking on me, looking on me?
Go ahead and stare and take a picture, please, if you need
And I think that says it all

I'm chasing it, I don't know why
I think about it a lot
Better hurry, running out of time
I think about it a lot
I can't tell anymore
I don't know what I'm looking for
You know what I mean?
I think about it a lot

Running on empty, but I have had plenty
You're complimentary, but I'm just pretending
Uniform, hide behind there, this is my diversion
Go ahead and stare, I'm a ragamuffin
Don't feel it, so fake it, I bait it, you take it
One eye in the mirror, put on my veneer
I coulda sworn it's a sure shot, are you onto my con?
Go ahead and stare, I'm a ragamuffin
