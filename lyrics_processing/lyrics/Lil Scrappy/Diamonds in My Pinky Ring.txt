Yuh
I'm so addicted to makin' money, it's funny
My speakers beat the block so the haters, they hear me comin'
The candy paint flippin' and swervin', it make ya pick up
Today I'm feelin' good so I'm destined to pick a bitch up
For the love of my chedda, my diamonds shinin' like I'm richer
My chrome wheels spinnin' so people can take a picture
Ain't never comin' flawed, throw some diamonds in my jaw
Put some pipes on the back, I be shakin' them haters off
Yound connected with some head bussas, haters comin' 'round
But ain't no competition, dumpin' bitches in the ground
'Cause I'm balln' like I'm 'posed to, money in the bank
Wanna get on my level but they flawin', they know they can't
I'm hot and I'm hot

Big bank take little bank, fuck what you damn think

Stay buckin' the crowd, in yo face straight super' crunk

Gotta swing on a nigga, man, fuck that bitch

Baby, shake it for daddy
Go get your friends and pussy pop it for me and Lil' Scrappy
And niggas don't want no static

And cock it back and knock you pussy mothafuckas off
Who want it? You seen it, I did it
Bitch, I switch Glocks and switch spots if it get hot
Switch drops and switch bras on they ass
And then I keep em admirin' my long dreads and glasses
Now I'ma flip paint-flip paint, smoke dank-dank
Money in the bank-bank with diamonds in my teeth and chain
And check out my pinky ring
You know it's blingin', mane
I'm jumpin' outta the Benz with diamonds all on my wrist and thangs

I'm gettin' to this paper like I'm supposed to be
Muh'fuckas in the street label me a young G
Diamonds in my pinky ring, get my watch and my chains
Bringin' pain to the game, lickin' all of these lanes
A.K.A. Mister T, the platinum version
Every nigga gonna hate if their pockets be hurtin'
Straight from Atlanta, totin' weapons like a black panther
Stackin' paper like my name was Tony Montana
Its G's up so get your G's up
I don't like to get violent but I'll fuck your ass up
Ayy, you don't really wanna taste my nuts
Make a meal out the deal and I'm still gettin' bucked
