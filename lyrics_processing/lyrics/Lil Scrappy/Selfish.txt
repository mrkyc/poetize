I catch a flight, get us a bag, but still you seem unhappy
We used to kick it and we'd laugh, but now we lost the magic
These girls be on me, I can't lie, like yeah I love the traffic
But I love your ass too, and that what make this tragic
Going through my phone now, house is not a home now
Can't seem to make it right, cause all you know is wrong now
I think we need a 
Cause lately all we do is 

Cause when I'm on the road, I be going up crazy
, I forget about my baby
Knowing damb well if she turned and did the same shit

No, I can't help it
I'm honest
Baby I'm selfish
No, you don't have to except it
I'm just being honest
Baby I'm selfish
My selfish ways
My selfish ways
Baby I'm selfish
