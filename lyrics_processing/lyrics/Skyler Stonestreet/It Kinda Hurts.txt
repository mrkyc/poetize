I'm 'bout to see the band play
Lead singer's my ex, I think we broke up on a text
And now he's here, right in front of my face
His girlfriend in the front row but we're talking after the show

You say you're in love with her, you say you're in love with her
You made it a point to say that you're in love with her
And it kinda hurts
You know that we're done with it
And I know that we're done with it
Too bad that it didn't work
And it didn't work 'cause I was a jerk

We haven't spoke for four years and four days
But now you're looking at me in that way
But you're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
You're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
That second song you sang was bittersweet
I swear that you were singing it to me
But you're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
You're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody

I even bought your t-shirt
If that's what friends are for can we pretend there's nothing more?
And if we can't, tell me how I should stop
Whiskey in my cup, why did I ever give you up?

You say you're in love with her, you say you're in love with her
You made it a point to say that you're in love with her
And it kinda hurts
You know that we're done with it
And I know that we're done with it
Too bad that it didn't work
And it didn't work 'cause I was a jerk

We haven't spoke for four years and four days
But now you're looking at me in that way
But you're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
You're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
That second song you sang was bittersweet
I swear that you were singing it to me
But you're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
You're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody

I don't remember eating dinner on the floor
Kissing you at the front door of your shitty apartment
I don't remember how or why it fell apart
When you play guitar in the dark you become my weakness

We haven't spoke for four years and four days
But now you're looking at me in that way
But you're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
You're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
That second song you sang was bittersweet
I swear that you were singing it to me
But you're with somebody, I'm with somebody, you're with somebody
