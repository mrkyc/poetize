We go where we like, we got over time
We get paid to rattle our chains
We go in the back, paint our money black
Spend it on the enemy
Sleeping in the church, riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work, make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed (Untamed)

Now our time, a real good time
(Do do do do do do)
(Do do do do do do)
Now our time, a real good time
(Do do do do do do)

(Do do do do do do)
Baby, you're mine

We know how to pray, party every day
Make our desolation look plain
Riding in a rut, 'til the powers cut
We don't even have a good name
Sleeping in the church, riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work, make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed (Untamed)

Now our time, a real good time, ooh
