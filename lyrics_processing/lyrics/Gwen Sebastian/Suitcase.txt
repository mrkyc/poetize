Got it out and laid it on the bed
Well, I wonder where it's been or what it's seen
Oh, if it could talk
We got it for a wedding gift
Yeah, we took it on that Cancun trip
Now, I'm emptying out your dresser like a tornado's 'bout to hit
I quit, you don't know it yet
But everything you own is in the suitcase
That's by the front door in the hallway
Waiting on you to take it all away
The "you didn't think I'd find out" mistake
I hope it hits you when you're leaving
The screen door and the guilty feeling
Well, I packed up all the heartache
You'll walk on down the driveway
With nothing in your hand but a suitcase
I found her lipstick in the pocket of our suitcase
I know I never bought that shade
Well, you must've found her lips on a business trip turned holiday
Now, I threw our wedding picture and my princess cut ring
Watching it sink right beside her lipstick in our suitcase
That's right beside the front door in the hallway
Waiting on you to take it all away
The "what the hell was I thinking marrying you" mistake
Hope it hits you when you're leaving
The screen door and the guilty feeling
Yeah, I packed up all the heartache
You'll walk on down the driveway
With nothing in your hand but a suitcase
I guess the love between you and me
Didn't have a lifetime guarantee
That's only good on our suitcase
That's by the front door in the hallway
Waiting on you to take it all away
The mountains of memories and mistakes
I hope it hits you when you're leaving
The screen door and the guilty feeling
Yeah, I packed up all the heartache
Go walk on down the driveway
With nothing in your hand but our suitcase
The one my mama gave us on our wedding day
