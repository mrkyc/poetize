Mmm, stada dada dye
Oh na-na, na, yeah

It's been a long long time now, since we've grooved together like this
A different vibe is in the air
Reggae music again, I
Happiness on every face
Peace and love for every race
Smile and greet with real friends over and over again
Oh!

It's being a long-long, long-long, long-long, time
We nuh have no vibes like this
Reggae music again!
Woah, reggae music again!
Oh!
And it's being so, so, so, so long
We no listen to some old time reggae song
Play the music again, yes!
Make we unite again, I

Remember when, way back then
Positivity was the message we sent
No man nah pretend
From the root, to the stem
It used to be Jamaica, no problem
Money a spend, borrow, or lend
A dem kind of love deh we need fi extend
'Memba when the skirts them a rub pon the pants dem?!
I, mmm!
