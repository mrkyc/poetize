Mi love Jamaica and mi nah sell out
Dem try clip we wings, some a we cyan fly out
But when we deh a Yaad, nothin' nice like Jamaica
Roast breadfruit and banana
Under di tree wid a glass of lemonade
Jump inna di river when mi ready fi bathe
Nuh bwoy cyan buy mi out
Mi nuh foreign minded, nowhere compare to Jamaica, uh

Jamaica love
We wanna feel Jamaica love
Everybody wanna visit Jamaica
Jamaica love, Jamaica
Jamaica love
We wanna see Jamaica love
Da one yah represent the citizens of Jamaica
Jamaica love, Jamaica

Represent weh you born
Through nuff hurricane and storm
From di crime rate drop, mi nuh matta 'bout tax, man still a hustle hard and a gwan
Jamaican 'av di link to di link fi connect Canadian, American, England
Mek sure seh when you deh a foreign and a hustle, mama visit Western Union
Come mek we build up we foundation
All Yaad man dem fi have ambition
Don't floss out all di money pon Ace of Spades, Hennessy, guns, and ammunition
Real Jamaican, unuh show mi yuh hand
Nuh matta which part inna di world weh you stand
Mi nuh matta wha' dem waan seh 'bout Jamaica, mi sing it out loud 'cah mi proud to be one
Bus'!

Big up the youths weh a wipe car glass
Youths weh a try and always a come last
Don't give up!  Don't give up!
Jimmy Cliff tell dem, many, many rivers to cross
Help out your sister if she get lost
Don't turn your face to the grass and pass
Show love to the elders
Respect due, 'cause dem pave the way inna past
Some man gwan like say dem better than people
True dem a drive a one vehicle
Vanity make dem move evil
It easier fi a camel past through the eye of the needle
Than the rich fi go sit down inna heaven and pitch
That nah work
Any how me ever hungry again, me a walk and look, pon every ackee tree me a search
