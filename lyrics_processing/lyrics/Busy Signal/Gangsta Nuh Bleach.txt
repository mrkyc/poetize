Certain things we nah work with

Alliance

Gunshot fi a man weh have a man up inna bed
And another set of man weh give the gal dem head
Man weh rape and killing people pickney, dem fi dead
Calling all warriors from Devon to Naggo Head, then
Thank father God fi put a roof over mi head
Hustle man a hustle 'cause we waan we daily bread
Mama no fi sidung with her hand upon her head and bawl
True her son inna the war, she haffi fled
You nah go see me with the tattoo of a man (Not even mi daddy!)
That no inna shotta plan
Dem inform inna song and call the name of a Don just fi get a forward or even couple grand
Nah

Roll out with mi Hott Ed clique
Nah fi hide from the sun 'cause gangsta nuh bleach
No
It's so cold pon the Hott Ed turf
And me and mi dawgs dem a patrol all when the Feds dem a search, yo
Roll out pon the Hott Ed street
The gyal dem waan the duggu-dagga, worse dem say me look ne-ne-ne-neat
It's so cold pon the Hott Ed turf
And if you fuck around or violate your skull ago burst
Ba-burst

You diss the thugs, you a visit the Parlour
Black out your sunlight, you nah go see tomorrow
Pussy a chat, check a stock, a friend gun him a borrow
50 caliber chop him fine, mince up him marrow
Dem shot yah connect like Lime, Digicel, and Claro
Inna mi black me slice him face, the pussy think a Zoro, Zoro
Zoro!
Mama inna pain and sorrow

Roll out with mi Hott Ed clique
Nah fi hide from the sun 'cause gangsta nuh bleach

Roll out pon the Hott Ed street
The gyal dem waan the duggu-dagga, worse dem say me look ne-ne-ne-neat
It's so cold pon the Hott Ed turf
