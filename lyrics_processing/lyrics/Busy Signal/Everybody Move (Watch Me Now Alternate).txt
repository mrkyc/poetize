Everybody fi a bounce
Everybody fi a move
Mi see old, mi see young
Inna dancing too
Everybody to the group
Stepping out, stepping out
We a winner, cyan lose
Stepping out, stepping out
People know mi clean any time when mi come out
Mi thing dem different, mi style cyan run out
Anuh nothing regular, this cyan burn out
Hot head inna yuh area, hotter than the sun out
Move to the music, move to the music
Tun it up, up, up, 'til you lose it
Never confuse, abuse, nor refuse it
No reggae, dancehall, different genre mi fuse it
So mi see the young and the old dem a lose control
And a music bring the joy to dem soul
Watch me tun it up, tun it up, a so we roll
Just listen keen to how the story unfold

Inna mi ears music a whisper yah now

Well neat whenever you touch streets and
On timing, move to the beat and
Hold a vibe, hold joy, make them see it and
Get up! tun up! Come out of your seat and
When the music hit, you say, "it's sweet" and
Them ya words weh Bob Marley speak and
Build a vibes and celebrate life, when your friend dem a meet and greet and
