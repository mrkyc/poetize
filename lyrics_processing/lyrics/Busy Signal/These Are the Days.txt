Yo, gotta get my bread, gotta keep my head up

These are the fucking days
When di gyal dem in dem teens have di fucking aids
Nuff yute nuh have degrees but dem have di grades
Picture this and try fi see it with yuh fucking ears
Ahh
These are the fucking times
When yuh sneakers ain't yuh only nines
Some weh call pon Jesus, a dem commit the crimes
Nuff illiterate and still a read between the lines
Ahh
Those are the fucking dudes
Claim dem a yuh friend and want yuh fucking food
Then some of dem a rob, while some of dem rape
While some of dem kill, while some of dem shoot
It's like we need a rated R pon the fucking news

These are the fucking days
When yuh cyan trust police wid dem dutty ways
Juveniles a run di streets wid the fucking K's
Yo, you cyan even rest in peace in yuh fucking grave
Ahh
Every day a di same shit
Different gyal, same dick
Different flow, same spit
Different drugs, same ship
Same Busy, different hits
With different messages reaching out to everyone in all different communities
Ahh

Mi cyan believe the baby mother dash the pickney in the thing we're pissing in
Baby father beat her wid the thing weh glistening, yuh listening?

Copper whistle, somebody missin' when you hear it stop
Another mother bawl while she suffer the loss

Welcome to these fucking streets
Chalk line, white sheet, regular we see it
Di less fortunate get treated like some refugees
But don't get fed up, keep ya head up, stay on yuh feet
Ahh

This day and age, it's like we're locked up inna fucking cage
