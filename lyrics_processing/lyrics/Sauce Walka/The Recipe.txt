(You undersplash me)
(Oowe)

These bitches is stressing me, these diamonds impressing me (Oowe)
Every rapper wanna drip flavor like a twin, cause I got the recipe
I remember riding blue bird to the pen, now I roll on leather seats
Knocked the bitch playing top golf on I-10 in Maison Margiela feet (Oowe) (Drip!)
I got the recipe

My soda is medicated
My chopper is decorated
I'm splashing diamonds on bracelets
We went and tatted our faces
Just to show that we done made it
I ain't drop music in seven months, but I'm on top of ya playlists
I ain't drop music in seven months, but I'm still ballin like Baby
But I'm still ballin like baby, you niggas tall as yall baby ballin
I bought a rari and that bitch growlin
I po'ed a pint on it then hit New Orleans
I ate some shrimp cooked on bourbon street
I broke a bitch off of bourbon street
She was lucky, she my favorite servant
Tryna find her purpose now she work the streets
You was nervous, geeked on perkies
Told her game that's worthless, now she work for me
She goin make a nigga hurt for me
Lace them heals up and twerk for me
She never wanna lose me certainly
Boy a desert ain't deserting me

Big Bun, I'm a big nigga
Keepin big heat with a big trigger
Got a squad gang, and Imma wig splitter
Put a couple holes in your hillfiger
Been trill, and ain't talkin bout clothes
Never take shit off of niggas or hoes
Still come down on candy and vogues
Fif and the grill slammin cadillac doors
Always get chose cause they still choose
Haters talk down but they will lose
Disrespect me you gon feel blues
That's not that fake, boy that's real news
Cause these are the facts homie
You make a play, you get taxed homie
I'm keepin nothing but racks on me
And they sittin taller than Shaq homie

Shining so hard, you need sun screen
Wanna be down, we need something green
If you gon be on Walka and Bun's team
