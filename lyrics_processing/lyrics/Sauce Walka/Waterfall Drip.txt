Drip!
Oh wee!
Don't drink out my drank, fool!

This 8 in my cup is too muddy (too muddy)
Red on my clothes, I'm bloody (SuWoo!)
I break the bitch for blue hunnids (blue hunnids)
I cannot drip witchu' dummies (you dummies)
I keep two clips for dummies (two clips for dummies)
She all on my drip, she love me (my drip, she love me)
Waterfall drip, I'm flooded, I'm flooded (flooded)
Waterfall drip, I'm floodin' (I'm flooded)
Waterfall drip, I'm flooded (drip!)
Waterfall drip, I'm floodin', waterfall drip (Woo!)
There's eight in my cup it's too muddy (too muddy!)
Red on my clothes, I'm bloody (SuWoo!)
I break the bitch for blue hunnids (blue hunnids)
Waterfall drip I'm floodin', I'm flooded (yeah, yeah, ou wee!)

I'm having choppers Afghanistan
I'm wrappin' bodies like Pakistan
I got AR's in the caravan
I seen a bitch with a helping hand
I send a bitch to fuck up your plans
My bitches white, them all Marilyn's
They catchin' plays up in Maryland
They bringin' me all dead presidents
They bringin' me All-Americans
They gon' go hard for papi
I'm plantin' seeds, no poppies
I'm banging B's, what's poppin
And on the streets I'm poppin'
Now the danger's on the internet
Fuck the referee's, we gettin' techs
Nigga, rap about me 30's to his neck
I just been back with my blood niggas
Same one's that came out the mud with us
Hurricane Harvey flood hittas
I sent the bitch in the flood, nigga
Came back, I gave her no hug nigga
'Cause the bitch was takin' too long, and forgot to bring the Backwoods home

You not my bitch, you funny
You do not get new money
You is a trick, you ugly
That's the only way you get a hoe
You tell her stand by the mistletoe
I fire off on a bitch, like a missile go
Hit the drank house, what its hittin for
My sauce has no limit like Mr coke
You lookin' for me, bitch here I go, here I go, here I go
I went to Vegas for bankrolls
I got some bodies that's case closed
My mamacita bring me Peso's
Foreign money, yeah we take those
Yeah, we want all of the guala
These is Raf Simmons, no Prada's
I break off strippers and models
I just fix all of they problems
I'm drinkin' Wok out the bottle
You know that ain't Wok in your bottle
Whenever I walk they gon' follow
I make the wave that they ride on
Ou wee!
