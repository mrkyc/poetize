(Chamberlain, he's got it)
Ooh-wee, splash
I'm just tryna raise the consciousness, ooh-wee

Lottery ticket in her hands, she tryna hit that Powerball
Her father in the feds, he been gone for twenty falls
It's brazy one decision'll make you break twenty laws
His daughter found the appeal lawyer, but he want ninety thou', wow
Runnin' the house, it ain't no duckin' these calls
Boy sellin' fentanyl when he could've stuck with the pounds
This a marathon, nigga, not a race
But trappers forget 'til it's a life sentence in they face
Take your forty years with grace
Don't cooperate, just face the actions of your fate
Unless you beat your case, just be a made man and stay
Remember swimmin' by the lakes and ridin' four-wheelers
Who ever thought those kids would be kingpins and cold killers?
Alicia son died at twelve, still feel his soul with us
Instead of AAU, she bought lip injections and nose fillers
She outside chasin' the life, never at home with him
Her sister an incredible mother, how is they so different?
Draymond Green at the pool, I'm 'bout to ho niggas
Your big homie tellin' the news and he a blow sniffer
How you lookin' up to pussy cat with four whiskers?
Every day you breathe is a bad day, bring him four snickers
Green Bottega boots on a bitch, she walkin' on pickles
She done bought a brand-new coupe from suckin' popsicles
When you hear the cops whistle
Switches on these Glocks turn these forty-cals to live missiles
Diamonds in this watch don't mean shit if I lose time with you
When you fly high from the flock, keep that iron with you
Ain't no slippin' and no fallin'
Everybody wanna foul a player when he ballin'
Maybach lookin' like Khabib when he crawlin'
Where was all y'all numbers when we needed? Now y'all callin'
Time to smoke this zion, headed to New Orleans
Could've put the zion, but my pimpin' flawless
Have you seen a millionaire become an alcoholic?
Move back to public housing
They was mad when he was on, but now he broke, his people smilin'
Ain't it sick how people rather see you broke and be around it
Instead of motivate your ass to get up and go be astoundin'?
Chris started a truckin' business that his auntie be the accountin'
Started making so much money he tried to go buy a mountain
But one day, he felt somethin' was missin' and then he found it
Auntie done backdoored him and hit for nine hundred thousand
Now his soul cryin'
Why we always getting butchered by own kind?
Try to support Black business, get hit with Black crime
Somebody gotta draw the black line
We out here wrestlin' for a belt to save mankind
Yeah, I love a bad-ass bitch and all her tan lines
But before I'll let a ho wife me, I'll work in sand mines
Hoppin' over landmines
Robbers hit the house during breakfast, they left the pan fryin'
Police shot an innocent student throwin' hand signs
Crucified Kanye on the news to keep the fans blind
Joe Biden can't tie his shoes, but 'posed to lead mine
She gave out her life to some fools that kept her sunshine
Left her on the dark side
Her soul cryin', feel her tears
How long we raised to hate each other? Too many years
We glorify dope sellers, not engineers
But the workin' man a target too nowadays by his peers
Maybach switchin' gears in Miami on the pier
Have them Haitians in your bush for actin' touch on them beers
Have you ever slapped the driver of a car before he steer?
Armed all through the windows tryna knock off his ear
Or did you live fear?
Granny doin' a yard sale, pricin' souvenirs
Fell behind on rent, she asked for help, nobody hear
How she left alone when she done raised so many kids?
