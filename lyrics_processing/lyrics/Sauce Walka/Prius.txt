I'm ridin' with cutters, I know that you see that
My bandana brackin', I know that you B that
We pop out on opps 'fore they find out where we at
I'm carryin', ain't gon' bang it, I'm breakin' your kneecaps
This syrup I'm sippin' is dirty like tree sap
If I push that button, boy, it ain't no recap
Start smokin' with me, and boy, you gon' need rehab
I took the hit in the treehouse
Bought an AP on a bee-yotch
Miami, AP on a bee-yotch
I was in Gucci and Yeezy, you barely in FILA
Boy, it took you too long to realize
Choppers as tall as my brother
I don't really think that I own a gun shorter than these size
Hop out my whip in the neighborhood
I never been to where niggas is throwin' me peace signs
She love a real nigga
Sauce spill the shit, make her feel, nigga
Ain't been too many niggas since Master P to touch a mil' without deals, nigga
Today I watched my partner make 67 thousand off of blue bill pillers
Bro say he wouldn't touch a brick if that bitch fell out the sky and hit him
Bro say the pills like the bitch, and them cheeks just can't deny the rhythm
If them blues jumpin' like that, partner, I can see why you're buyin' in 'em
'Cause the bitch had me first class to pick up a hundred like Charlie Wilson
And this foreign that I'm ridin' in really drive itself, so I'm ghost ridin' the whip, wood twistin'
Blake Griffin horses, yeah, the Pistons
Flu game, Jordan's two 6's
Just in case I gotta fade away after I face shot one of you sum' bitches
Best believe every time a nigga play with me I'ma do somethin' vicious
Fuck wipe your nose, I'ma wash your dishes
Get your whole family off the wishlist
Extra, extra, extra, off the hitlist
Then go pimp my ride like Xzibit
