Ok
Ooweeeee!
Drippp!
Ok

Pints in my house to the ceiling
Drank to my ear I can't even listen
All this water on a nigga wrist make a white man wanna go fishin'
Sauce done made the bitch lose her faith cuz the shit she do for me ain't Christian
I took the bitch on some money missions
On some shit that can get ugly missions
Never sent her on no dummy missions
But...you know that pimpin' ain't easy
Sprinkle that flavor that seasonin'
Then take his watch and his visa
My game is cold as ten freezers
Out in Alaska on ski slopes
I'm sippin syrup on speedboats wit 2 bitches thats speakin no Englos
Two chains on my neck weigh a kilo
But just about one is a kilo
The bitch done flew me out to Rio
I been goin' wit plans in Berdino
Ain't no squares in my circle that we know
Ain't no snakes in my circle that we know
I pimp bitches and stack up my Cheetos
And shit on my Fritos who gave me Doritos
You might also like
Away
The bitch want me she gonna pay
And if she do I'm gonna stay
And make sure it's all ok
Ok, ok

Pourin my pint in 2 liters
Ridin' around with big heaters
How the streets is nowadays I don't know if my enemy is one of my people
So I be damned if I don't come with that sleeper
So everyday ima walk with that beeper
Come with some smoke and on sauce Ima bleep ya
In otherwords that mean Ima delete ya

I'm blowin' a zip ok (ok)
I'm pourin' a brick ok (ok)
I pimp on a bitch ok (ok)
All my niggas rich ok (ok) (drip!)
I rep with a stick ok (ok)
Yeah I'm with the shit ok (ok)
All my bitches thick ok (ok)
And they with the shit ok (ok)
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, okayy
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, okayy
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, okayy
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, okayy
So look
Keep all that shit
