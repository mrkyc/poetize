JRag on the beat
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ooh-wee

I just knocked a little bitch out Andreas
If a nigga pimp, I'm on his playlist
I send bitch from here to Barbados
I bang red like a bag of tomatoes
I buy diamonds to shine on my haters
We got nothin' for free but we made it
My lil' partner went fed and I hate it
Made him god in the streets, they like raidin'
But he home complainin' and he got berated
It was nothin' I could do to save him
Niggas ain't wanna move how I raise 'em
OG bless you with jewels, you best take 'em
Tryna be the next boss in the making
Think you don't need no game, you mistaken
Bitch, you out with no rules, you won't make it
To no greatness
And these hoes, some rough times they be snakin'
Never know if they work with the bacon
Never know if these niggas be fakin'
Never know if these niggas be hatin'
Gotta stand on ten toes like a weigh-in
Check the shit at the door, yeah the Days Inn
Put your work in your hood, yeah, your days in
Knowin' that you'll be bready to race in
You don't want to be cereal, brother
Reputation imperial, brother
Hands is water, aquarium, brother
I might break your bellirium, brother
I don't even know what that is
I just know I hit hard, damange
And I stand on a bitch, too savage
When I jump on the freeway I'm racin'
And Mal be pacin' 'cause he made me waitin'
Ain't no way you gon' send me to Satan
I'ma pull out that Spray-c' and start yankin'
I'ma shoot at the glass and call, "Bank it"
Like we some like kids playin' 21
I was locked in the pen by 21
Had my birthdays in there, talkin' 'bout 20-somethin'
I came home and I made a quick 20-somethin'
Niggas 'fraid as all-time and that twenty nothin'
Niggas breakin' in cars, that's that nickel hustlin'
I was walkin' out Johnny with nickels buzzin'
Finally got you a Jesus head, I was custom
Niggas tried to keep up with me, I still dust 'em
Yeah, you got a lil' bread but you got no mustard
So that still mean that you got no flavor, buster
I put the plays on the table, buster
I'm popular, reason she paid you, buster
You little ungrateful motherfucker
I pull up in your city, hundred cutters
We keep under-armor, no Splash Brothers
But y'all been known that we been the Splash Brothers
Diamonds shinin' like lotion, no ash, brothers
Put a hit on your sister, no cash, brothers
And I'm sippin' that red, spaghetti
I'm kickin' that Eddy while bumpin' that Freddy
Nigga say they want grease so we ready
But we stay by the stove and we steady
You know playin' with fire's deadly
You know playin' with fire's deadly
You know playin' with fire's deadly
You know playin' with fire's deadly
