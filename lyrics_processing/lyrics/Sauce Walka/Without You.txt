(Brandin Blanco)
This shit ridiculous
Sad-ass shit man
Oowee

I gave so many niggas chances to advance
These niggas rather tussle with they girlfriends than tussle with these bands
I had to make a different plan for my hands
These niggas still be happy from the stands
How the fuck you feel like a man, riding another dick?
I ain't never loved my mama, how could I love a bitch?
She chose to smoke the crumbs from bricks, I chose to go from crumbs to bricks
It made me fit, my body immune, the shit that made me quick
Shit, I ain't never have no cold, my mama made me sick
I ain't had no kisses
All my birthdays, I ain't had no wishes
Like, how the fuck is this kitchen dirty when we ain't had no dishes?
My life was vicious
My mama would leave me for a month with chicken
At her cousin house where she out smoking with some nigga tricking
Not short, but different
My daddy was a security guard in a picket
Checking for people ID's as they walked up in they business
No pay-per-views, see, my daddy could barely pay for shoes
I used to wish he was The Rock, I wouldn't have grabbed the tool
I made the news same age I was still making grades in school
The only reason I got rich because I hate to lose
I made the cruise and I ain't had nobody ship to use
I ain't had nobody whip to move, I kept it smooth
We pushed it through without you
You might also like
Without you
I did this shit without you
I did this shit without you

I ain't never had no assistance
I did this on my own, I was gifted
Nobody stood next to me, I used my own logistics
I've been prolific
Look up in the sky, R.I.P. to Nipsey
A damn shame when you can't trust your set or your city
It's such a pity
'Cause this the shit that we love more than titties
This shit is silly
But now that shit turned over, we in Miami counting millies
Jet skis on the water, we got Sixers out from Philly trying to score something
Every bitch walk in this mansion trying to hold something
My bunny took off with his ice, the bitch called it snow running
For sure hundreds, it ain't no more fives up in these stacks, buddy
We buying buildings, built from scratch, buddy, relax, buddy

I did it without you
On sauce, I did
You should have stood in there, nigga
Ten toes down
You should have kept your feet to the motherfucking ground
Should have kept your mouth closed, you shouldn't have made a sound
All that bumping 'bout these millions, saying you gon' hold it down
