Young walka why you splashin so hard
Why these basic bitches faggin' so hard
Why these simp niggas braggin' so hard
He say he broke the bitch and he had a menage (he lying)
Why my diamonds always shining like big stars
Why these bitches buying me drinks at the bar
Why he treat my bitches good and still get charged
Then they bring me all his money they got No Heart

My bitches stay on a mission
Taking your money thats drippin'
Bringing that cash to the kitchen
Paying for all of the expenses
I showed her everything christmas
I showed her everything glisten
Long as she paying attention
Long as she paying attention
I am the man to mention
I don't need money from bitches to handle my business
But the fact is I do business
And I rather do business with bitches than niggas
I'm out here tryna' get figures
I don't want honey like pooh I want grands like tigger
I sold the roc like I'm Jigga
But I moved on to bigger and bigger and bigger
Sauce on your phone I deliver
Enter your credit card number I'm in your system
Im saving hoes like a christian
And if she stop paying tithes I'mma dismiss her
I'm blowing up like a missile
And if you love your family before you die you should kiss them
Niggas is dying for crystals
Robbing theses niggas for these chains fake as a swindle
I'm drippin' sauce fuck a pencil
I don't even like writing my text when I send them
I got racks in my denim
Perfect chopper so small I can slide them right in em
Walk in the club with the chopper
Sauce like man I should show these niggas the coppers
I send them both to the doctors
I'll shoot any nigga who ain't treatin' me proper
