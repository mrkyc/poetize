JRag on the beat
Ooh-wee

Scoot up in here like a bumper car
I'm drippin' sauce like it's no tomorrow
I whip that gas in my Audemar
I'm pullin' strings like a damn guitar
I'm with pterodactyls in Jurassic Park
I'm cookin' grits if they askin' for it
I'll send a bitch in a plastic bra
All of my niggas got aim
All of my choppers got names
You niggas outside the gang
Nigga get out of line, he flamed
He get caught out of bounds, he hanged
Catch him out and I doubt his brains
Right outside of your house, we came
All you did was hide out, you lame, Out Gang

Splash up on the outs with a K
Send an out nigga outer space
If I find out he was tryna play
Ridin' out with a baby spray
Got the hitter tied to a shoelace
Your bitch wanna see what my jewels taste
I'm too busy changin' that cruise taste
Yeah I pour a pint every day
I be drinkin' eights like Smart Water
Niggas say lean 'posed to make you go to sleep
But it make me drip harder
I just fucked on a weird bitch in LA that act with Will Smith's daughter
I could make Selena Gomez break Justin Bieber like a pimp taught her
While you was savin' for your first chain, nigga, I was probably on my fifth order
You old niggas still think y'all could play out the game, y'all ain't Vince Carter
Your defense ain't nothin' to me
I step back and Harden for three
Just like Harden I'm saucin' your P
In the streets, on me (Ooh-wee, drip)

Scoot up in here like a bumper car
I'm drippin' sauce like it's no tomorrow
I whip that gas in my Audemar
I'm pullin' strings like a damn guitar
I'm with pterodactyls in Jurassic Park
I'm cookin' grits if they askin' for it
I'll send a bitch in a plastic bra
All of my niggas got aim
All of my choppers got names
You niggas outside the gang
Nigga get out of line, he flamed
He get caught out of bounds, he hanged
Catch him out and I doubt his brains
Right outside of your house, we came
All you did was hide out, you lame, Out Gang

Scoot up and pop like a pimple
All these cookies, smoke clouding my mental
Someone's toolie just tucked in the rental
We gon' scoot up and blow like a missile
They can't common sense you, I know that I hit you
Bet a hundred that Spray-co gon' lift you
It blow like a whistle, them people gon' miss you
Send a nigga ass home, okay
Up, up, and away, like an early dismissal
Might Judge Judy VLONE today
So my drip is up, gotta keep me a pistol
Like a pimp, keep my ho on my hip
Cuffin' that bitch like a new pair of scissors
We don't sleep when it's war over here
Tryna creep and then reap the lil' son of a nigga
I'm glad I went chose me a roll over niggas
And I'm on the road but I'm not on no jigga
Stay to myself, not a role model figure
'Cause I love to ride, love to jugg and tote pistols
Fuck the other side, we gotta slide on them niggas
I'm the one scootin' up in the streets
I'm the cook if they callin' it beef
Fuck the smoke, bitch, we want all the grease
They deceased, I'm winning, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Scoot up in here like a bumble car
I'm drippin' sauce like it's no tomorrow
I whip that gas in my Audemar
I'm pullin' strings like a damn guitar
I'm with pterodactyls in Jurassic Park
I'm cookin' grits if they askin' for it
I'll send a bitch in a plastic bra
All of my niggas got aim
All of my choppers got names
You niggas outside the gang
Nigga get out of line, he flamed
He get caught out of bounds, he hanged
Catch him out and I doubt his brains
Right outside of your house, we came
