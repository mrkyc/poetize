XO Saucy
Oohwee, splash
Chamberlain, he's got it!
Splash, drip, splash, woo

Stuck to the code of the streets
I be with players and G's
Ain't no snitches around me
I sent the bitch to work
She sellin' ass, no twerk
I Gucci collared my shirt
Then I smash off in a vert, they hurt
Stuck to the code of the streets
I be with players and G's
Ain't no snitches around me
I sent the bitch to work
She sellin' ass, no twerk
I Gucci collared my shirt
Then I smash off in a vert, they hurt

They hurt
I Gucci collared my shirt
My diamonds came from the earth
No I ain't sellin' no work
No I ain't poppin' no percs
My bitches poppin' they skirt
I make a ho out a nurse
She put that Glock in her purse
She hid my skin off in it
Don't let that fat ass get you killed
I'll have 'em skin your fitted
She done marine gold titties
I got bitches, on some Trina shit
That lay up in Saks like the baddest bitches
Drive my 'round the city with them chopper sticks
Everybody claimin' Murder One
But in real life they never murdered one
Only thing you niggas ever sprayed
Was water guns when you playin' with your son
This some shit that I done really done
Beat cages fat as Big Pun
All my niggas shinin' like the sun
'Cause these backstreet boys never sung
You might also like
Stuck to the code of the streets
I be with players and G's

Stuck to the code of the streets

He mad
How you still broke as your dad?
How you thirty in a Jag?
How you nineteen with on stash?
How you twenty-three with no pad?
How could you beg for pussy in the strip club instead of chasin' that cash?
Why would you hate when you see me?
Double date with two bitches from France
Niggas is gay, only time you double date when it's you and your mans
I'ma just have to pull up with some double K's and go'n and ruin your plans
My niggas scoot up in vans
They gon' knock you out your Vans
I ain't never had a reason for a heart
My mama would shoot out a cast
Boy your mama had you in church
After that, take your suit out your hand
While you was singin' Wade in the Water
I was in the kitchen tryna rock a quarter
In the dopehouse, really takin' orders
Then I got a bitch, then I got smarter
Stuck to the code of the streets
I be with players and G's
Ain't no snitches around me
I sent the bitch to work
She sellin' ass, no twerk
I Gucci collared my shirt
Then I smash off in a vert, they hurt
Stuck to the code of the streets

Ain't no snitches around me
I sent the bitch to work
She sellin' ass, no twerk
