I'm fuckin monumental
Pull up and pop off like Tahoe's I'm presidential
You niggas extra simple
You bitches extra simple tryna pop like pimples
Thirstiness is the issue
You do this shit for the wave this ain't really in you
For that I can't commend you
For that I know that you fake I will never feel you
Anyway lets continue
I'm sending bitches all flavors, you need a menu?
I'm smoking that "yeah I hear you"
All of my diamonds remind me of what I been through
My drippin is so essential
Just lost my mama and I couldn't touch a tissue
I couldn't waist my potential
Mama thank you for my sauce girl you know I miss you (Ooouwweee)
