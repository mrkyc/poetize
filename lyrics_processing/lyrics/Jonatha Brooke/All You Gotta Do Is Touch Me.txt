All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me
All ya gotta do is touch me good
All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me
All ya gotta do is touch me good
All ya gotta do is touch me easy
All ya got to do is touch me slow
Baby and all ya gotta do is just hug me and squeeze me
All ya got to do is let me know

'Cause I fully aim
To get my soul known again
As the maniac (The maniac), the saint, the sinner
The drinker, the thinker, the queer
I am the works, the whole works (Whole works)
And it's not 'til you have called me all of these things
(Not 'til you have called me all of these things)
That I feel satisfied (Hear me Jesus)
I feel satisfied (Satisfied, come on)

Well and all ya gotta do is touch me, touch me
All ya gotta do is touch me good
All ya gotta do baby is touch me, touch me
All ya gotta do is touch me good
All ya gotta do is kiss me, just kiss me
All ya gotta do is kiss me good
All ya gotta do (All you gotta do) is hug me all day
Baby all ya gotta do is kiss me all night
You might also like
No one will ever know, when you are ready, ready for me
But I know when you feel ready for me, oh
And you know when I feel ready for you (Baby)
The others will never know
The other will never know, in all of their words

All ya gotta do is touch me, touch me
All ya gotta do is touch me good, oh oh
Well then all ya gotta do is hug me (Touch me) squeeze me
All ya gotta do is touch me good
(And that's exactly what I'm trying to do here, honey)

Well let me see the way you move
Let me see the way you move
Warm skin soft with a cat step groove
Well girl
Let me see the way you move
What a cat step groove
Let me do what you hope I'll do
Let me do what you hope I'll do
Let me think what you want me to
See the way you move
Let me say what you want me to say
Tell me what you want me to hear
Let me hold you like you never ever been held before
Let me do what you hope I'll do (Oh girl)
Let me think what you want me to (I wanna do that)
Touch me, touch me, touch me (And I wanna do that)
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me (And a little bit of that)
Touch me, kiss me (And some more of that, yes I do)
Mmm, all ya gotta do is touch me, touch me
Like you never never never never never never never been
In love before
All ya gotta do is touch me good
