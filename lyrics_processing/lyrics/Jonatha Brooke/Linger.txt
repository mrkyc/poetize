I am walking past the sprinklers and the newly painted porches
And the lemonade stand girls on a suburban afternoon
I am leaving 'cause I love you, I am leaving 'cause I don't
And I'm, I'm hoping you will follow
And I'm praying that you won't let me go

And I am captive in your presence
I will melt before your eyes
But I still crave your approval
And I'm helpless when you criticize, criticize

'Cause it's written on your body, it's on the tip of your tongue
The look in your eyes in the glare of the sun
The touch of your cold fingers when you say goodbye
The way that you linger, the way that you lie

You saw me through the keyhole of the door that I kept locked
But I'd decorate the threshold just in case you knocked
What I might feel on the edges you will never come to know
And who I might be in the corners I will never ever, ever, ever show
Ever show, no
You might also like
'Cause it's written on my body, it's on the tip of my tongue
The look in my eyes in the glare of the sun
The touch of my cold fingers when I say goodbye
The way that I linger, the way that I lie

Who said that love would linger?
Who said that love would last?
When we cannot seize the moment and we will not leave the past
I don't think I was afraid of you but how could I be sure
When with every altercation you were showing me the door
Well here I go, here I go, here I go

'Cause it's written on our bodies, it's on the tip of our tongues
The look in our eyes in the glare of the sun
The touch of our cold fingers when we say goodbye
The way that we linger, the way that we lie
The touch of your fingers and the look in your eyes
