I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share
Hope you're happy
I hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share

Kevin you remind me, dot the i's
Don't drop the names of those who've come before
Ear down to the ground don't compromise
Don't close your eyes until you get what you came looking for

Kevin you remind me, don't look back, don't second guess
Have another go, have another drink, 'cause it won't be long
I look down at my hands and saw the violence, so I toss it back
It's such a fine line between right and wrong

And when you've made your mark
They'll take you down
And when you've had enough
That's when they'll come around
You might also like
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share

Day strains into day like so much water through the tea leaves
What a shame
And there's another call that's not for you
And Kevin there was a reason in the madness
There's a reason in these lines and rhymes
A reason in the curve of time

'Cause I say you made your mark
You took yourself down
And I hope you got enough
'Cause we're still around
(Trying 'til we get it right)

I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share
I hope you're happy
Hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share
I hope you're happy
Hope you're happy with your glass half empty
Even though you got your share
I hope you're happy
Hope you're happy with your glass half empty
