One, two, three

I bottled up my hope before it got spread too thin
I threw it in the ocean and then I jumped right in
All my heroes disappeared just like deja vu
I'm a strong swimmer and I swam right into you

Now there's evidence I've been here but no one knows how long
My change is in your pocket and the whisper of my song
My clothes are in your closet and my books surround your bed
Wonder what you expected, baby, and what you got instead
What you got...

'Cause I feel the steady pull of things that I can't see
And I like it
I feel the steady pull of things that I can't see
And I like it, I like it, I like it

My friends all think they've lost me, my family's up in arms
But no one ever noticed 'til I sounded the alarm
There's danger in complacency and comfort in the fight
For the way that you whisper in the sweetness of the night (Yeah)
The sweetness of the night
You might also like
'Cause I feel the steady pull of things that I can't see
And I like it
I feel (I feel) the steady pull of things that I can't see
And I like it, I like it, I like it

Where there is ruin there is hope for treasure
And out of the ashes come comfort and pleasure
This is the love that no one could measure
I have you, I hold you
We are birds of a feather

I bottled up my hope before it got spread too thin
I threw it in the ocean and then I jumped right in
All my heroes disappeared just like deja vu
But I am a strong swimmer and I swam right into you

'Cause I feel the steady pull of things that I can't see
And I like it
I feel the steady pull of things that I can't see
And I like it, I like it
I feel the steady pull of things that I can't see
And I like it
I feel the steady pull of things that I can't see
And I like it, I like it, I like it
(Ha ha ha ha, I like this now, mmm)
The sweetness of the night
'Cause I feel the steady pull of things that I can't see
The sweetness of the night
Sweetness of the night
'Cause I feel (So sweet, so sweet)
The steady pull of things that I can't see
I like it, I like it, I like it ('Cause it's just so sweet to me)
The steady pull of things
