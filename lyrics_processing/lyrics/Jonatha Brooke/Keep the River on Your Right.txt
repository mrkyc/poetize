You build me up to tear me down
Throw me in the fire
You twist the things I say around
And paint me as a liar

Sometimes I don't know just what I'm doing
But I can see exactly what I've done
I have made my peace with my reflection
And nothing you could do
Nothing you could say would make me run

So keep the river on your right, and keep walking
And never let 'em look you in the eye
Keep the river on your right, and keep walking
Never ever let 'em see you cry

They tell you take it like a man
Pain will make you stronger
But this is not the path I planned
And the road keeps getting longer

The journey started out with good intentions
I never thought my life would come undone
No one ever took the time to mention
Trouble always finds you
Trouble always finds you when you run
You might also like
Keep the river on your right, and keep walking
Never let 'em look you in the eye
You keep the river on your right, and keep walking
Never ever let 'em see you cry

'Cause even on the high road
The devil's at your back
Anyone will tell you, tell you that the

Journey always starts with good intentions
You never think your life will come undone
Everybody's looking for redemption
Well there are many rules to live by
Me I'm only thinking of this one

Keep the river on your right, and keep walking
Never let 'em look you in the eye
You keep the river on your right, keep walking
Never ever let 'em see you, let 'em see you cry
Keep the river on your right, and keep walking
Never let 'em look you in the eye
Keep the river on your right, and keep walking
And never ever let 'em see you cry
Keep walking
