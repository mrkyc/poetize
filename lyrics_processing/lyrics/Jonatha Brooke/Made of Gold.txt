I'm going down to the river
I'm gonna look for you
I know you'll be waiting there
'Cause it's a woman's trick
I'm gonna give you what you want
'Cause you've been asking
And I don't even wanna know your name
But you'll remember mine
You will remember my name
You will remember my name
You will remember my name

Like the nights in the movies
I'll be waiting
And the days in the heat of her vengeance
You'll know what I've wanted
What she wouldn't admit
I'll show her, I'll show the world
Just what they asked for
And they'll remember my name
They will remember my name
They will remember my name
They will remember my name
You might also like
And what you want most will elude you
What you want most will elude you
'Cause everything before it changes
Seems to be made of gold
Made of gold
Made of gold
Made of gold

In some strange way I'm preparing myself for you
I've been waiting all my life
But I won't give you what you want
I won't fight
I will live, and tell
And you will remember me
You'll remember my name
You will remember my name
You will remember my name
You will remember my name

You'll try to hide me under the mattress
With all your other short sins
But I'll come back, the click in my spine
Will order our lives like a metronome
You can't shut it off
You can't shut it off
You can't shut it off
You can't shut it off
And what you want most will elude you
What you want most will elude you
'Cause everything before it changes
Seems to be made of gold
Made of gold
Made of gold
Made of gold
Made of gold

And like the river, you will remember my song
