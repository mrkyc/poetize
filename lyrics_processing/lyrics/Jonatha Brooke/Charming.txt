If it was any other year or any other life
But this one is mine to carry on now
Yes, it's mine to carry on now
'Cause I will always disappoint you
Is it vengeance or your pride?
'Til you lose me like that trinket on your bracelet
Charming, charming

In the dream it's all a test that I face by myself
Lose the briefcase, lie at the airport
Swallow the inky code
We'll all answer in the end in our temporary tongue
But for now, don't say anything
Don't say anything
Charming, charming
Charming charming

'Cause there, at the garden verge
I will pull you up in hope again
No more second thought
Will crowd you out of your desire
To be loved, not touched
To be blameless and ecstatic again
This is all there is
No knowledge is too much to bear in the end
You might also like
And I want this more than anything
And I want the damned red shoes
And I want to lead Dorothy back home
Here today, here tomorrow
Here's the lay of the land
Here's my heart, here's my sorrow
I surrender
Charming, charming
Charming, charming

'Cause there, at the garden verge
I will pull you up in hope again
No more second thought
Will crowd you out of your desire
To be loved, not touched
To be blameless and ecstatic again
This is all there is
No knowledge is too much to bear in the end
At the garden verge
I will pull you up in hope again
No more second thought
Will crowd you out of your desire
To be loved, not touched
To be blameless and ecstatic again
This is all there is
No knowledge is too much to bear in the end
At the garden verge
I will pull you up in hope again
No more second thought
Will crowd you out of your desire
To be loved, not touched
To be blameless and ecstatic again
This is all there is
