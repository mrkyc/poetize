I'm still chasing cars
Playing in the undertow
Barking at the stars, wondering where you are
Thinking that I'll never know
I still play with fire
Hoping that I might get burned
Toying with desire, teasing to the wire
Thinking that I'll never learn

Some things I earn
Some things I steal
And there's an angel on my shoulder
But the devil's got the wheel
I toe the line, but then I fall
'Cause heaven knows I like the taste of danger most of all
Danger most of all

Standing on a ledge
Don't you know I wanna jump?
Not that I would give my desire to live
I just wanna try it once
I just wanna know
What it is to make the leap
How the wind would blow, how fast I could go
Who would pray my soul to keep
You might also like
Some things I earn
Some things I steal
And there's an angel on my shoulder
But the devil's got the wheel
I toe the line, but then I fall
'Cause heaven knows I like the taste of danger most of all
Danger most of all
Danger most of all

It all comes down to this
There's a million souls out there
Dying for a wish, living for a kiss
Hoping for someone to care
On any given day
You can hear their songs and cries
Kneeling down to pray, wishing they could say
They had never compromised

Some things I earn
And most things I steal
'Cause there's an angel on my shoulder
But the devil's got the wheel
I toe the line, but then I fall
'Cause heaven knows I like the taste of danger most of all
Some things I steal
Most things I earn
'Cause the angel's getting older
But the devil never learns
I toe the line, but then I fall
'Cause heaven knows I like the taste of danger most of all
Danger most of all
