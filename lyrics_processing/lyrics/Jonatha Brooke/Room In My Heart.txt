We pinned the tail on Jonny Polanski
And asked mother may I, and she said I was it
And nothing mattered, nothing but the moment
Some days made perfect sense, some days never fit

But there was room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you

We captured the flag in our own foreign countries
And took each other prisoner bit by bit
We take no prisoners now in this sullen landscape
Just ask for forgiveness and hang on to our wits

But there was room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you

I'm hard wired, fully detonated
You pull the pin and you can't put it back
Oh it's a crash course, fully consummated
'Cause I was aimed from birth to break off from the pack
You might also like
But there was room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you

Ah so here's what I keep, here is what I carry
The sweetest intentions, love in the remains
And here's what's strange and what's extraordinary
Nothing changes but nothing stays the same

But there's room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you
Room in my heart for you

So here's what I keep, here's what I carry
The sweetest of intentions and love in the remains
Here's what's strange and what's extraordinary
Nothing ever changes but nothing stays the same
'Cause I know your secrets, I have tasted their fruit
I have known the flash of her teeth in the dark
And you thought that I wouldn't notice
And you thought that I would not follow suit
