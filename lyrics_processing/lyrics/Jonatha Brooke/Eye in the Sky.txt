Don't think sorry's easily said
And don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I'm not gonna give any more
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
'Cause part of me knows what you're thinking

Don't say words you're gonna regret
And don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusations before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more to know that
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I can read your mind (Mmm)

Don't leave false Illusions behind
And don't cry 'cause I ain't changing my mind
Go on find another fool like before
'Cause I ain't gonna live any more, believing
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more to know that
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more to know that
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
