You want sexy
I give you sexy
Heh-he
It's Brick and Lace and Jurassic 5
And I like that
Mercy yeah!
Mercy yeah!

There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra-la-la-la, brown girl in the ring
Tra-la-la-la, brown girl in the ring
Tra-la-la-la she looks like a sugar and a plum, plum, plum

Yeah, you're too cute too resist
And you'll probably wanna mention you're not used to this
Hope I don't seem hard pressed
Can a brother get your number email address
I'mma keep my eyes glued
And hate on any brother that talks to you
'Cause every time the feelin' gets hard to deny
I'mma put it on paper this is what I describe
Intelligent self, fly female
Perfume smell even if its not from Chanel
Hair and fingernails every time that you flaunt
The fly debutante issue that I want
And you can trust me
Plus give me props when you discuss me
It's about to be super ugly
But tonight is the night I'mma make you love me

Yo, what it look like, she look like
We my ticket at the end of the night
Ugh, she my type, tall just my height
Char brown skin, African descent
So decent, world wide princess
Get down to business
Ain't by the bullshit (mmm-hmm)
Y'all know, stand up tall
Queen of the ball, nah
She ain't a pimp y'all

Back and forth, forth and back
If you lack support, got your back
We gonna have a laugh, lil' chat
Some food after that, make a pack
We gon' make you crack a step back (there's a)
Fresher than a burst of air
Will it work, will it hurt, when I persevere?
'Till the dirt, I'm a flirt, put you first my dear
I'm afraid you gon' desert when the worst is near

Tra-la-la-la, brown girl in the ring
Tra-la-la-la, brown girl in the ring
Tra-la-la-la, she looks like a sugar and a plum, plum, plum

Her day starts with a bus and a backpack
Half-burned cigarette, studyin' some black facts
Baby got it goin' on in her own hood
All the fellas on the ride know it's all good
Is it really though? Ask me how I figure though
Gimme just a second, I'mma tell you what a brother know
She was fifteen, following her false scene
You know flossin', Moe went tossin'
Baby had dreams but she put'em off often
She'd rather slow wind then grow her damn mind
Living in the hood is like walkin' on a landmine
Yeah, come on

Watch me shake to the left and copy it up on the right
Me gots the goods to deliver
We got the mind to shiver
We come for rockin', yeah
We come for rockin', yeah
It's in the pocket, yeah
No one can stop it, yeah
