Yeah
Testing, testing, one, two
Uh, one
Press the panic button, governor

We be the crew, guess who, the J-U
R-A-double-S-I-C, we're
In the place to be, it don't stop
We got the rhythm that makes your fingers
Snap, crackle, pop-pop, fizz-fizz
We're known to give a show plus handle our business
Stress (Stress), we destroy
We're known to make noise, 'cause we original B-boys
In the flesh, cradle to the death
Creates the ill scenes when we manifest, yes
I feel the vibe, I feel the vibe too
'Cause it's the butter from the crew
'Cause we original, who
Wanna tussle? Flex vocal muscle?
While we kick the style that busts your blood vessels
With the rhythm, the '96 stylism
Pick up and peel 'em, fill 'em, kill 'em with your vocalism

Yeah, I shoot the giff while plantin' a full spliff
Vocals are coming quicker than Anna Nicole Smith
Malignant metaphors and ganja stay herbs
We conjugate verbs and constipate nerds like you
I'm here to end the conspiracy fearlessly
So you can really see the real emcees (at hand)
I'm 2na Fish on the stick-shift
The eclectic, hectic, desperate to set trip
You might also like
For the niggas who feel that they're twenty-four karat
Plus the way you're livin' get you underwater baptism
Believe it or not, it's the rugged and raw
Put a bullet in the head of four at Mount Rushmore

Yeah, release the beast from within, baptize gins
Keep company with friends that repel sin
I'm out to win, ain't no pretendin', fuck the First Amendment
My speech was free the day that my soul descended

Earthbound, we break sound barriers
Some niggas can rhyme, but they got no character
So we preparin' you for war, don't give up the fight
You need to stand up for your rights

And grab a mic and get loose
Produce the juice that keeps the head on
Collision with the New World Order opposition
Competition, none, there's only one in the universe
That knows the final outcome

We got incarcerated minds, men, women, and enzymes
Vibin' off the rhymes sent from the divine essence
Presence effervescence, not to be contested
Some miss the message, go ahead and bless this
So don't mistake us for a crew that used to hit
We on some underground '75 Wild Style shit

We be the crew, guess who and it'll be
The J-U, '95 A.D.
We be causin' ramifications, physicians
Sendin' brothers on grammar vacations if they don't listen
Competition, bustin' shots and people basin'
But we can relieve constipation
Jurassic 5 emcees
And we got the cure for this rap disease
So come on, everybody, let's all get down
'Cause I'm down by law and I know my way around
