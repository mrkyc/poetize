One, two, one, two
Get out my eardrums here in the Red October
It's, uh

I'm an aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that
An aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap

2na the smoke jumper, packin' my oral cannon
Bustin' from Okinawa, Japan to Laurel Canyon
Swallowin' flows, we turning like plush tires
Mellow in droves, lyrics be burnin' like brush fires
Spreading vocal leprosy using discrepancy
Lyric weaponry lessens your chances of testing me
So stop and freeze, emcees, I block atrocities
True philosophies from the lips of black Socrates
The pocket penciler in your peninsula
Killin' Dracula emcees who bit from my vernacular
I can back it, the ill scene we occupy
No lullaby, got you high when I rock a fly
Verse for my people, let it breathe slow
Give a heave-ho and stimulate your cerebral system
DJ Nu grip the fader with 2na the group debater
We murder you duplicators, 'cause
You might also like
I'm an aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that
An aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap

They call me mister antagonistic, drastic
Comin' from the crew that's on some blast from the past shit
The last shit unified was the cornerstone
Now a lyric pistol to the dome is how we warn a clone
Born alone, the strength of God makes my mission higher
They found the liar dead, strung up with fishin' wire
The mystifier, packin' vocal artillery
Makin' lovely word connections like Chuck Woolery
The cool in me, I'll make your block turn on one rhyme
Electrifyin' like some nocturnal sunshine
The planetary pioneer and his mixer
DJ Nu-Mark and Chali 2na spittin' scriptures
Paintin' pictures
Even sisters adapt 'cause we take it back like chiropractors
Fuckin' actors on wax make it worse for
Real emcees who worth your while, so they search for me

I'm an aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that
An aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that
An aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that
An aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap
No rhymes

I'm 2na Fish, nigga, ain't no fuckin' twisting my posture
Lickin' shots 'cause a brother gots to
Get my proper, shrimp and lobster on my dock like a mobster
Givin' shouts and stakes to sustain my stature
Altered chemically, ain't no gimmick behind
The way that I'm designing my rhyme line for line
You'll find in your neighborhood, there's a flavor flood
Whether you're a ghetto star, or if your name is mud

I'm an aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that
An aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that
An aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that
An aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that

It's like that
Peace
Much respect to my man Gio Rob G
