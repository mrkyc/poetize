Yeah, yeah
J-U-R-A-S-S-I-C-F-I-V-E
Yeah, yeah

He who is without sin cast the first stone
Blast the verse, no matter the class or birth stone
Kickin' it for you hypocritic berserk clones
I'm hopin' that words spoken the words that touch home
And clutch domes, you think
Electrical sockets and wet feet
How you infinitely get sleep
The minute we get deep
Ladies and gents peep
One hundred percent heat
Up undersea mistreats
No wonder you mince meat
Yes, I'm from UNITY
My last name sits in the middle of opportunity (Huh)
With two-laid plans and new-made fans
My crew raid lands and punch like the Kool-Aid Man

It was a long road to glory
Battle for territory
Just to be called the masters of the ceremony
Marathon, decathlon
Wordplay mega-bomb
Metabolism with the rhythm, keep it goin' on

The epitome, five-hundred thousand so convincingly
Street ministry, J5th the tune infantry
Finna be, about to be the best kept commodity
Twelve incher LP, we're representin' properly
Now possibly the knock could be that old school philosophy
That if it doesn't rock for me, it's not considered property
Remember me, remember us
Ice cold, Cold Crush
1920 gold rush
Rollin' up, hold up
Now, ain't no need for you to be surprised
When we implement and improvise
With each and every verse that I
Get busy with, lacing it with murder talk
Turn a 'sault, tomahawk
Razor sharp jabberwock

'Cause I'm a fresh kid
We're makin' our bid
And we're doin' lots of things that we never did
We went to Paris in the springtime, Bahamas in the fall
We thank Allah, we doin' it all

It was a long road to glory

Pick a paragraph and phrase it
Mentally, you save it
Kick it to the world and suddenly they crave it
That's the way it is in this verbal warfare
Workin' hard for the love, but there ain't no whores here
Years been puttin'
Wanna play, put your foot in
'Cause you'll be comin' back like the brother Dwight Gooden
Seven's back again, slappin' men and askin' them
If they really wanna fuck with the style, we tappin' in

Ayo, I just couldn't wait to grab a piece of my own cake
So I can elevate and hold my own weight
My mind state be the ghetto
Street corner heavy metal
Black like the pot and tea kettle
My street credibility
Minus negativity
Multiplied energy
With a touch of humility, soliloquy
Of a real MC
Tastin' the grammar
J5 slamma jamma
It was a long road to glory
Battle for territory
Just to be called the masters of the ceremony
Marathon, decathlon
Wordplay mega-bomb
Metabolism with the rhythm, keep it goin' on
Battle for territory
Just to be called the masters of the ceremony

Oh, here we go
Metabolism with the rhythm, kep it goin' on

Oh, here we go
Metabolism with the rhythm, kep it goin' on
