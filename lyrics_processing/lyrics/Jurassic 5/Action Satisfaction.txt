I seen the dead man grins, the seven deadly sins
Couldn't keep his mouth closed in the house of the chins
The all-seeing eye that recognize the rap clones
Plus possess the pin to crack the pyramid stone
It's the call of the wild, that's why my words rank high
To drop a verse for nine planets that fell from the sky
Do or die, you and I get fly with rap expressions
With the one, two, three, four, five

In the session with the lesson
'Cause in treble and bass we trust
With the rebels vocally ready in case we bust
And write up power chords and ruckus if the place be plush
We kickin' old school as Julio Iglesias
Tapes we push be straps with no safety catch
We attack like a bullet 'til your face relax
And think about it, if you ain't got the class to flee
Be mentally ready for Jurass-catastrophe

And now it's time for me to rise, the lyric utilizer
Down like fertilizer, quick to improvise
A style that can surprise, your eyes is on the prize
We can go line for line, I ain't hard to find
While we break your spine, my mild style reclines
I'm laid back
All that talk, you need to save that
The payback is all the reason that I'm flexing
Vets rockin' like we X-Men
You might also like
You want action, satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long, long while
You say you want action, satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long, long while

Microphone set, who's up next to pull a fast one?
Lyrically connect the dot and then I blast one
Now who wants action, satisfaction?
Lyrics remind you of bass, I'm everlasting
Castin' plagues, my style still crossing switchblade
My mama shoulda named me Grace 'cause I'm amazingly
Blazing with the fire and desire
I'm world-renowned, I gets down to the wire

If any child of mine get out of line boastin'
My style of rhyme covers you like calamine lotion
Lifted like out of vine motion, I spend time stroking
Used to drink dollar dime potion and dime boasting
But now my rhymes open brims of spirituality
We be giving power that you can share with your family
Aerodynamically cutting through danger
Ripping your narrow mentality, nothing but flavor
You want action, satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long, long while
You say you want action, satisfaction
It's the J5 Jurassic, not the Jackson 5
We alive and well, unify, rebel
Set the vibe, only time will tell

(By the way, you say you want satisfaction)
(What-what-what, what, action)
(By the way, you say you want satisfaction)
(A little action)
(By the way, you say you want satisfaction)
(Postitive, action)
(By the way, you say you want satisfaction)

The moral of my oral ammunition rendition
2na fishin', Dotty Doo, and Marc 7even collision
Yo, we be forever keeping niggas on they P's and Q's
And enemies who snooze leave diseased and bruised
I see through your crews like an X-ray tool
That gamma-rayed your function, left you with assumptions
That we be the butter clique we smother with
The action, satisfaction, guaranteed to be Jurassic
You want action, satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long, long while
You say you want action, satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long, long while

It's like that, y'all
It don't stop
To the beat, y'all
