Check this out, real quick
I don't know if everybody know us personally as individuals
So what I want to do right now is
I want to take this timeout just to introduce everybody
So let me just introduce everybody
I need from the people up top
From the people on the bottom
And the people in the back on both sides to give it up when I say
(When the music is the soul, and the soul is the music)
So what I want to do right now is
I just want to go back a little bit with y'all, check this out

Yo, dressed in indigenous garb sittin' abroad
The words that I use to be awed, people applaud
Now watch how the brother adapt, fill in the gaps, perhaps
I play the block until the curb collapse
Now check the method and put the message on record
Promote the effort and change the neighborhood preference
And keep'em guessin' from the old to the adolescent
It's J5 and it ain't no half steppin'

The word play we display
Can only convey the vibe when they DJ
Colonial rep but far from the MVC
Feel sorry for those who bystand innocently
The menace in me divides men's courage in half
I murdered my staff, demolished every nerd in my path
The verbal giraffe will tower over new day jive
We do play live, ask the people who they fly, the crew J5
You might also like
We ride right into the night, words that we write
We'll calm down then settle your sight, come to the light
The word play we display, kept us movin' from Tokyo to LA
Catch the feelin' as we move on
Follow the groove and steadily soothe
Gotchu' all comin' in two, follow the crew
No mean thing cause we tied like shoe strings
When we sing you hear buzz like bee stings

This is a, uh, very historical moment for us as Jurassic 5 man for real man
I feel like, uh you know, we have some serious support out here...

You know we bring this back 4 u
So you know we bring this back 4 u
So you know we know we know we know we know we
So you know we bring this back 4 u

When we play you walk this way
We walk in faith I hope you feelin' great
We came here tonight just to celebrate
Put ya hands up high you know we're rockin' the place
If you came here to hate you came way too late
Jurassic emcees and came to set shit straight
Originality, check the way we originate
Style and communicate check the way we demonstrate
Countdown, three, two, one
Some rappers'll speak the real, and I can see through some
I focus my sound, I'm never sellin' surplus pounds
I'm workin' to smash and drown all you circus clowns
You try to diss and get your limbs crushed like ants eggs
Some are fatal where my Timbs touch my pants legs
We indestructible plus these magnificent kings
Beat over book by overlooking insignificant things
That bullshit that you bring

You know we bring this back 4 u
So you know we bring this back 4 u
So you know we bring this back 4 u
So you know we bring this back 4 u
So you know we bring this back 4 u
So you know we bring this back 4 u
