Are you with me, party people?
Party people, are you with me?
Are you with me, party people?
Party people, are you with me?
Are you with me, party people?
Party people, are you with me?
Are you with me, party people?
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your finger pop
A-to the tick-tock, a-tick-tick, tick-tism
Live and direct is the rebels of rhythm
On your radio
Turn up the stereo 'cause it's working
Well, I'm the coolest of the cool and they call me Akil
Hip-hop fanatic bustin' lyrical windmills
And I'm the international king of all things
Creates the ill scene, shades my robin tune bring
Yeah, I'm funky fresh, I got style and finesse
From the north to the south to the east and the west
And if the roof's on fire, put pen to the paper
I fade with the Jada, it's the live motivator
And from shore to shore and from sea to sea
And everywhere that we go, we in the place to be
You might also likeLike that, rock the house
Until my man Cut Chemist rocks the house
Until my man Charlie 2na rocks the house
Until my brother Nu-Mark rocks the house
Until my man Marc 7even rocks the house
Until my brother Hani, rocks the house
Until my brother Kalil rocks the house
Until my brother Faru turning it out
Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum
So it might be right for you, it may not be right for some
So come one, come all, hey, big or small
Because I'm guaranteed to rock you out your drawers
Biting emcees always get lockjaw
I'm not Volume T, but I'm harder than all y'all
And just in case that you forget the way we will be rocking it
From here until the next time, flexing with the fat rhymes
One time, prime time, flowin' with the fatness
Many shades of skin cream, hip styles of Blackness
Match this, never practice makes perfect
Sharp like the edge on a blade that's curved, tips
Serve this? Yes, but only when fresh
So you don't have to guess the R-E-B-E-L-S
Dip, dip, diver, socializer
On the rise, the committee's wiser and will disguise the truth
Of the matter, we're sick of the idle chatter
The data we pitter patter, we'll splatter just like a platter
Infected uncontrollably, follow me, come on, go with me
Flow with me 'cause you know it be 2na and Marc 7even
Heaven does await us, put here to sedate us
He made us in His image with blemish
Never perfect, but driven by a force unseen
But we divulged its presence, so this rap goes back to the essence
Lessons have been written forbidden, but you're soon to see
Comin' to your community, rebels of rhythm unity
Yeah, and you don't stop
You got the rhythm that makes your fingers pop
Yeah, and you don't stop
You got the rhythm that makes your fingers pop
It goes one, two, three to three to two, one
To an apple to a pear to a peach to a plum
Listen to the drum, does it make your ears numb?
Here it come, here it come, here it kiddy-come-come
Well, I'm an independent, good to the limit
Never in my life been to the VD clinic
You can salute me, but I'm not a lieutenant
Down with Nu-Mark and my man Cut Chemist
Well, my name is Marc 7even, yes, the S-E-V
And ain't another emcee that can touch my tree
Down with Unity and the rebels three deep
Grab the microphone and release your seeds
Yeah, and the formula for me to get bent
And the spot was never hit if I didn't leave no fingerprint
Extra fat with colonial combat
Keep you stay put in the shed in the House of Wax
And I'm limpin' like McAfee, don't ever think of jacking me
Never gun packing because that ain't my life to begin with
Not a dimwit (Angry?), only somewhat (Why?)
Brothers keep holding me back, I'm 'bout to go nuts, man
'Cause niggas know I paid my dues and shit
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up 'cause I refuse to quit
And this one here is dedicated to the crews that bit
I'm about to blow the fuck up 'cause I refuse to quit
I'm tired of givin' my trust and gettin' used and shit
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up 'cause I refuse to quit
It doesn't matter who's fatter, who's wack or who's legit
I'm about to blow the fuck up 'cause I refuse to quit (Yeah)
Yeah
Yeah
Yo, yo, yo, who let the dog in here?
Yeah, yo
Dog leash (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Shout out, you know, we goin' up (Yeah)
Got Big Rock in the house (Chi-Town)
My boy cousins, my boy's endangered species
Yeah, my man Shiny Mack up in Nebraska
Oklahoma City?
