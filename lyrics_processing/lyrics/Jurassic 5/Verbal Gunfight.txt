(Meanwhile)
Yeah-yeah
We're not in a regular kind of business
Yo, now what you hear is not a test
This is a verbal gunfight, like the wild, wild West
And if you got beef, get it off your chest, my son
Because the two is gonna show you how the West was won

We rolled up to the spot about a half past noon
Jumped from the horse, slid into the saloon
Walkin' in the spot, I heard the music man stop
Danced up to the bar, a double snapple on the rocks
Now Mr. Bartender told me strangers get flack (Really, black?)
But they'll be fuckin' with the black billy jack
Feel the MAC, pull the trigger they never even got the chance, bruh
We move the crowd like we was Hoss on Bonanza
And my drink he never passed it, he got real sarcastic, fat bastard
"You them niggas from the crew called Jurassic?"
Talkin' mad shit as his face showed a frown
You niggas better leave before the sun go down

'Cause uh, we be the king of the verbal gunslingers
You better bring a casket, a preacher, and a singer, nigga
We be the king of the ones that brought static
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
You might also like
Ayy, yo, somethin' lookin' fishy, yo, I think we better watch
Yo, I'd make sure you got your trigger uncocked
Yo, I'm sayin', real niggas always deal a gun blast
Get the horse, kiss the girl, grab the mic, and let's dash

'Cause uh, we be the king of the verbal gunslingers
You better bring a casket, a preacher, and a singer, nigga
'Cause when the lead locks on, it'll lift ya
I'm not a grifter more like a high-plains drifter

And as the plot kickened, thickened, niggas started shovin' me
Muggin' me, tuggin' me, into the good, bad and the ugly
Troubly doubly, I grabbed a glass full of bubbly
Publicly rubbin' me, I told my nigga, Chali, "Cover me"
Yo, I got your back and I'm buckin', I'm lookin back and I'm duckin'
I'm tryna get us the fuck out the place
Brothers who was harassin', we was doin' the blastin'
Yo, suit go get us the bucks out the safe

'Cause, yeah, we be the king of the verbal gunslingers
You better bring a casket, a preacher, and a singer, nigga
We be the king of the ones that brought static
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Yeah, dead men never tell about the things they saw
The stakes is what can make a man become an outlaw
Hey, we be the peeps who keep the past alive
It's 2na fish, and Akil from the Jurassic 5
Ayy, yo, peeps has been grand, but understand, we in a hurry
Emergency currency, many niggas that wanna murder me
Heard of me, and 2na fish capacity
Keepin' the West blazin' like Sundance and Butch Cassidy
Man, we need some type of plan 'cause peeps is skanless
They think that they can make a man hush with the ambush
My man bust 'til you crack the safe
Yo' back is safe and we gon take the back escape, now break
Now if you don't know who we are, I suggest you better hide
Or look down the devil's eye, sing a lullaby
And the picture on my poster make my left side my best side
I'm on my last two rounds I let a thousand free
I heard the bartender called for the cavalry
Now they outside, waitin' on my pal and me
Verbal gunslinger forever and proud to be

'Cause uh, we be the king of the verbal gunslinger
And now they got the casket, the preacher and the singer 'cause they
Fired at the five, stay alive, yo
Rhymin' with our back to the wall, tryna to survive the fall
'Cause dead men never tell about the things they saw
The stakes is what can make a man become an outlaw
Hey, we be them peeps that keep the past alive
