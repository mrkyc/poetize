You know them ladies, half-amazing, half-crazy
Baby wanna make a baby, baby, please what she say to me
Ain't nothin' new up under the sun
She want a boy, I don't want none
Girl just wanna have fun
I'm tryna' get my funds, count my ones
You know them ladies, half-amazing, half-crazy
Baby wanna make a baby, baby, please what she say to me

Nothin' new up under the sun
Gotta brother up under the gun
Better run 'cause a girl got a plan to get a man
Ain't no ring on my hand
All she want is me and her to be one
Uh, let me tell you how the story begun
At first, thought she was the one
She was chill then so much fun, her Uzi weighed a ton
Didn't know I was chillin' with a loaded gun
Can you feel or hear me son?
Disappear, reappear, call me, hang up
Love me, hate me, quit me, date me
Baby on the low might Robert Blake me
You want your problem solved, holler dog
Can't be seen with her in the mall
Givin' you a piece of my catalogue
Never thought you would pull up at a broad
But I had it y'all, bagged it y'all
Hate it when a girl get mad at y'all
I'm savage y'all, don't panic, nah
The reason why a fly nigga haven't called

You know them ladies, half-amazing, half-crazy
Baby wanna make a baby, baby, please what she say to me
Ain't nothin' new up under the sun
No money, no car, why you call me a bum
'Cause you got cake and I'm scrapin' crumbs
Now I'm on a video, your face look stunned
You know them ladies, half-amazing, half-crazy
Baby wanna make a baby, baby, please what she say to me

Nothin' up under the sun, fellas succumb
When they nails and their hair get done
It's better for some to tell'em when young
Keep'em under space in the place 'til their head get sprung
I can't mess with you hoes, out to get my dough
Ulterior with the mo' from my heart the plot is closed
You know, you thought since I was nice
Since I was blind like some mice
But I'm a man with that vice
Baby please get it right
All of us used to walk the world
Awkward scared to talk to girls
Every flavor, even chocolate swirl
Can't get a housewife from a stalker girl
Uh-uh, can I handle a high-caliber woman?
Camera hold steady, a blast and I'mma move it around
Tryin' take advantage and vanish for standing, how I'mma get down
You know them ladies, half-amazing, half-crazy
Baby wanna make a baby, baby, please what she say to me
Ain't nothin' new up under the sun
She want a boy, I don't want none
Girl just wanna have fun
I'm tryna' get my funds, count my ones
You know them ladies, half-amazing, half-crazy
Baby wanna make a baby, baby, please what she say to me

Uh, I'm a break it down, real real quick
Just cause she fine don't mean she fine
In the time it took me to write this rhyme
Baby done slept with all mankind
Don't play me, play lotto
You can't rev me like no throttle
Get yo' ass up out that bottle girl
Stuck up in some model world
Let me spit this mane, flip miss thang
Put it in a way just to get this dame
Sorry girlfriend, I forgot your name
Don't blame me, just blame the game
Your claim to fame ain't your brain
Without no game her aim can't complain
She don't wanna make the change
She just wanna shake that thing and chase that fame
You know them ladies, half-amazing, half-crazy
Baby wanna make a baby, baby, please what she say to me
You know them ladies, half-amazing, half-crazy
