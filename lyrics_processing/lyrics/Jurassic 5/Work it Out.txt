Uh, yeah
One, two, one, two

A-don't stop, stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead, lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

Hey, we live and we learn, we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
It's not appealin' as you truly speak your feelings
I'll be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back, best believe it'd be forever
'Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters

A don't stop, stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead, lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

Uh, uh, hey
These are different times but we feel the same pains
The blood of mankind runnin through the same veins
We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame
Same crimes even though the names changed
And we like different minds workin' off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin' off the same train
In the end, makin' it right's the main aim
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame

A don't stop, stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead, lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

Yeah, oh
Now if you know what I know you need to work it out
If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out
You havin' problems with your family then work it
The things we go through just to work it out
I work it out when the situations seems unworkable
Unreversible  but God is most merciful
Many works, many men converse
With soul search sweat it out
When they tryin to work it out
With the constant complaint, we other gonna make it fly
Or we ain't, I already know what some of ya think
I'mma talk a hip hop and how bad its got
Then tryna pull a brother, I'm not
Lookin' for nobody to judge, you said you ain't I never said you was
I'm just tryna get with ya and pose in the same picture
So this mic thing can move the right thing do the right thing
Made for your life game, plus my man might sing
(One, two)

A-don't stop, stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead, lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
A-don't stop, stop your dreamin'
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
Go ahead, lose yourself inside this opportunity
