Linguistic, language liquid
Get lifted, love life and live it
We twist it, bend shape and shift it (come on)
We gifted, young black with lyrics
We thrive to keep the party live
We strive to be wise and enterprise
Socialize, dip but never dive
Set the vibe and keep our eyes on the prize, yo

Stay on top of this, see if you can follow this
Drink and swallow this, heat from the hollow tips (bom-bo-bo-bom)
Bounce rock skate with the quickness
Shake a hip to this, tell me if you feeling this
If you are let me know who you are
Turn it up real loud, let it beat in your car
I'm the best by far like my man Omar
Make it real loud noise, let me hear where you are

If you ass-lick in this rap shit get slapped quick
Match wits, words seal up the cracks like ChapStick
Hock spit  lyricals packed with content
You never will have none like an empty convent
This musical bomb threat offset your defence
Ain't been another competitor better than we since
Some of you brothers sound like repetitive recess
We release the repressed stress 'cause we blessed like
You might also like

Reverse the rhetoric, y'all need a sedative
My style superlative, you're more murderous
You know you heard of this J-5 sickness
Bump it when you lifted, put us on your wishlist
We make it hot, sentences 
Period, we serious, boy you know what we got
Shit, hot heat, these Erik Rico beats
They vibrate the streets so please press repeat

Crazy rhythms, here's the doorway
I'll go my way, you'll go your way
Crazy rhythms from , it's just crew
Ahh yeah!
Here's where were we'll have the show down
I'm too high brow, you're too low down
Crazy rhythms from , it's just crew

Yo, my poeticness fly nigga etiquette
Dress elegant never talkin' arrogant
We get together with our inner city relatives
With no embarrassment I'll tell you where the party is
It gotta be hot groove and a vibe
So throw your hands high for the crew J-5
Variety in pedigree, old school melody
Bump what you tellin' me, you feelin' it then let it be
