Yo, it's like this, when Allah said, "Let it be light"
He also designated poetical brothers with mics
For whoever had the skills to possess the gift
Combinated with the flavor and it go like this, 2na Fish

The manphibian, citizen with the lesson plan
Cashier at the J5 concession stand (Akil)

The militant steel with the peripheral
Telegraphic skill build up force field (Mark 7even)

Fundamentalist bringing my verbal gift
My style is packed Quik like cocoa in Swiss Miss (Zaakir)

For the way my pen sticks to rhymes
'Cause a million party people, it's about that time

And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
'Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drum
We take four emcees and make 'em sound like one
You might also like
I be the spark from the cannon, blaze the outstanding
Tug of war with the poor, rich, and scandalous
Roadrunning bandit, race against advancement
Style winds, cause storms when I perform

I'ma plot with John Robot and stomp your whole spot
Then peep your whole crew, the bunch of know-nots
Dissect you from the inner, then declare myself the winner
Once the style clears, you'll be grilled like dinner

I'm 2na the black door contractor
Attacking your backdoor, you're trapped in my trash compactor
Move back, bore, smooth as velour, the trap door
That's causin' the capture for brothers who rap or

Yeah, check the shelling, rock niggas redder than watermelon
The greed-stricken, rotated 20/20 vision
Rap felon, hottest rebel with bad spelling
I pitch shift with unprecedented sharpness

Distributor, local street corner contributor
Word inhibitor, scientific impositioner
Rhythm Commission DJs for real
He drives the crossfader like a cutmobile
We perpetrate, no fake, no fraud, no phony
Jurassic masters of the ceremony
You came, you saw, and right before your eyes
In fact, the old-school flavor has survived, like this
J5 and who with it?
J5, the J5, hah, the J5, hah
The J5, the J5
The one, the two, the three, four
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
'Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drum
We take four emcees and make 'em sound like one
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
So whoever bought the tape, bring your butt right back
'Cause you never in your life heard a cut like that

Hey, we flip fast, phonographs, 45 records smash
Hot weather forecast, it ain't nothing they never had

Make a move, never lose, competition quick to choose
New styles, hot rhymes, guaranteed to blow your mind

Who is he? The subtle and fanatic for unity
Demonstratin' the ghetto diplomatic immunity

Well, I'm the style stimulus, sound photosynthesis
Super with the sentences, in the lab for centuries
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
'Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drum
Takin' four emcees and make 'em sound like one
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
'Cause it's the brothers on the mic in the place to be
