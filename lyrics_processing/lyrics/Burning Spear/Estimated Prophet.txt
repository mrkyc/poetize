You should believe me

My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
It's been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
They tell me where to go

California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
You're like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
(Standing in a shaft of light)
Just like an angel
Rising up to paradise (Paradise)
I know I'm going to shine (Shine)
Yes (Shine)

And I'll call down thunder on the rebel
And speak, speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flames, burning flames
And might and glory going to be my name
And men gonna light my way (Light my way)
Along the way (Light my way)
