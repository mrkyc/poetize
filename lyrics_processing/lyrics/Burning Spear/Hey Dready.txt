Rastaman, not knowing his
Name like any other man
The first thing they say is
"Hey Dready!"
Some Rastaman don't like the
Name, Dready
I am happy with the name
Rastaman; I am happy with the
Name, Dready
I have no intention to
Criticize my bredren; I have no
Intention to criticize my sistren
When we wake and see the sun
We should give thanks
If there is no love, their will
Never be peace
I have no intention to see the
Battlefield
I want to live my life
With love
Love for one another
Regardless who they are:
Ladies and gentlmen, bredren
And sistren
