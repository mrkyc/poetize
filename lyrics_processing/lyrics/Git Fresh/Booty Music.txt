When the beat goin' like that (Boom, boom)
Girl, I wanna put you up in my room
I wanna put you up against that wall
Throw you on the bed and take your clothes off (Clothes off)
Everybody don't like it slow (It slow)
Consider me one of them folk
Let's get to it (Get to it)
Do it (Do it)
Get to it (Get to it)

Kinda crunk and I'm on this scene
Have a lil' blast and that's my shit
Once I had a shot of that good Petrone
I'm all in my boxers like Bobby Jones (Bobby Jones)
Everybody don't like it slow (It slow)
Consider me one of them folk
And let's do it (Do it)
Do it (Do it)

Tryna keep up with that tempo
Make it all night 'til your back gets sore
'Til we just can take it no more
Look at that ass like, "Oh, my god!"
We clap back 'til you give me applause
Somethin' like...
Hmm, when I get in them drawers

Get your hair in tangles
I wrap it on my ankles
I'm grippin' on your handles
I'm hittin' on different angles
Like ten, five cent, ten cent, dollar
Ten, five cent, ten cent, dollar
Ten, five cent, ten cent, dollar
