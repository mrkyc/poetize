Some people tell me
That you're not my kind
And I'd believe them
But I can't get you off of my mind
Some people tell me that I should stay away
Maybe I will, some other day

'Cause it feels right
You know, it feels good
And I don't always do what I should
And I know what makes me happy
And in my heart, you are it exactly

I don't wanna do right
I just want you tonight
Not just only in my dreams
Save my best behavior for a little later
'Cause I'm only 17
I think I've made my mind up
I've got time to grow up
Face responsibility
Livin' in the moment
Keepin' my heart open
While I'm only 17
You might also like
I'll learn my lessons
And I'll make mistakes
And if I get burned
Well, it'll be my heart to break
It isn't easy, hearing what they say?
Sometimes you've got to
Take a leap of faith

'Cause it feels right
Yeah, it feels good
And I'm not gonna do somethin' stupid
Just this once I wanna feel like
I can do what I want
When I hold tight

I don't wanna do right
I just want you tonight
Not just only in my dreams
Save my best behavior for a little later
'Cause I'm only 17
I think I've made my mind up
I've got time to grow up
Face responsibility
Livin' in the moment
Keepin' my heart open
While I'm only 17
Anyone
Who's ever been
In love
Has got to know
What it means
To have a dream
And no one can
Say anything
To change my mind
No, not this time

'Cause it feels right
You know, it feels good
And I don't always do what I should
And I know what makes me happy
And in my heart, you are it exactly
I don't wanna do right
I just want you tonight
Not just only in my dreams
Save my best behavior for a little later
'Cause I'm only 17
I think I've made my mind up
I've got time to grow up
Face responsibility
Livin' in the moment
Keepin' my heart open
While I'm only 17
I don't wanna do right
I just want you tonight
Not just only in my dreams
Save my best behavior for a little later
'Cause I'm only 17
I think I've made my mind up
I've got time to grow up
Face responsibility
Livin' in the moment
Keepin' my heart open
While I'm only 17
Only 17
Yeah
