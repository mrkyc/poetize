Baby, it's real
Ooh, ooh

Innocence is what I've got
It'll take true love to hit the spot
Can't control my every move
When we're together, we're in the groove
Don't care about your other girls (Your other girls)
I'm the only one that rocks your world
Gonna have to keep me satisfied (Keep me satisfied)
'Cause my innocence won't be denied, no (No)

Baby, it's real (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
That I just can't explain the way
That it's making me feel (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
It's real (Baby, baby)

I just can't let ya go
Baby, oh, baby, it's real
Keeps me hanging on
Baby, it's real
You might also like
My heart is under lock and key
Together we can set it free
Ain't no mountain that we can't climb
All you gotta do is take your time (Take your time)
Said I'm giving you my all and all (My all and all)
Be careful you don't slip and fall
It's my innocence that makes you yearn (Makes you yearn)
For that perfect gift you can't return

Baby, it's real (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
That I just can't explain the way
That it's making me feel (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
Oh baby, it's real (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
That I just can't explain the way
That it's making me feel (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
It's real

I just can't let ya go
Baby oh, baby it's real
Keeps me hanging on
Baby it's real
Baby you know that it's real
The way you makin' me feel
You know that baby, baby, baby, it's real
Baby, it's real (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
That I just can't explain the way
That it's making me feel (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
Oh baby, it's real (Baby, baby)
So, so real (Baby, baby)
