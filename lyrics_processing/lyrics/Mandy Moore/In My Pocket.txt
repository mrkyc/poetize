Among the many muted faces
You try to find me in the spaces
You're drawn to my song
Oh, you only move to keep from sinking
You close your eyes as if you're thinking, afraid all along
That in my eyes, so revealing
You'll find what you're needing

Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Nothing but faith to keep me warm
Well, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love?
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All that I got to keep you warm
So baby, don't leave me here without it
Tell me, how much for your love?

(Nothing but pennies in my pocket)
(How much for your love?)

Hoping the melody will leave you
You walk to where I might not see you
Reach out to the wind (reach out to the wind)
No, looking to catch it for a minute
But just to hold it, not be in it
I've been where you've been
'Cause I'm so afraid the love will reveal what you're made of
You might also like
Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Nothing but faith to keep me warm
Well, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love?
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All that I got to keep you warm
So baby, don't leave me here without it
Tell me, how much for your love?
Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Nothing but faith to keep me warm
Well, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love?
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All that I got to keep you warm
So baby, don't leave me here without it
Tell me, how much for your love?

Your love, yeah, yeah
Your love
Nothing but, nothing but
(Nothing but, nothing but)
'Cause I'm so afraid the love will reveal what you're made of (baby)
Nothing but pennies in my pocket
All I got to keep me warm
Well, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love?
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All that I got to keep me warm
So baby, don't leave me here without it
Tell me, how much for your love?
Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Nothing but faith to keep me warm (mm, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well, baby, then I'd be broke without it
Tell me, how much for your love?
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All that I got to keep you warm (oh-oh)
So baby, don't leave me here without it
Tell me, how much for your love? (baby, I'd be broke without it)
Nothing but pennies in my pocket
Baby, then I'd be broke without it (oh no)
Slip my heart in your back pocket
All that I got to keep me warm
So baby, don't leave me here without it
How much for your love?
(Nothing but, nothing but) Uh
