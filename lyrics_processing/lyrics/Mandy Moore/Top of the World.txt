For a time, I felt my faith it must be hiding
Searching through the sky
Hoping to find a way, a way
To get me through the day
Wonder where I belong
Is this where I should stay?

You lift me up when I am falling
You're my friend when I was calling
Now I'm on top of the world
Top of the whole wide world
Yeah, you always been believing
Give my life a whole new meaning
Now I'm on top of the world
Top of the whole wide world

It's the strength in me
It seems I have forgotten
Now I, realize today I'm starting to dream again, again
Was a matter of when
I guess we all lose our way now and then

You lift me up when I am falling
You're my friend when I was calling
Now I'm top of the world
Top of the whole wide word
Yeah, you always been believing
Give my a whole new meaning
Now I'm on top of the world
Top of the whole wide world

Top of the whole wide world
Yeah, you always been believing
Give my life a whole new meaning
Now I'm on top of the world
Top of the whole wide world
Yeah, top of the whole wide world
Yeah, you always been believing
Give my life a whole new meaning
Now I'm on top of the world
