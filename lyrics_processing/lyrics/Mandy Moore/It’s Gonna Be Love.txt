It's gonna be you, baby
Time and love's been patient for so long
How can I pretend to be so strong?
Looking at you, baby
Feeling it too, baby
If I'm asking you to hold me tight
Then it's gonna be all night
It's gonna be love
It's gonna be great
It's gonna be more than I can take
It's gonna be free
It's gonna be real
It's gonna change everything I feel
It's gonna be sad
It's gonna be true
It's gonna be me, baby
It's gonna be you, baby
It's gonna be
It's gonna be love
Time am I restless or a fool?
How can you pretend to be so cruel?
Maybe it's me, baby
Maybe it's true, baby
Maybe it's everything we're dreaming of
We've waited long enough
