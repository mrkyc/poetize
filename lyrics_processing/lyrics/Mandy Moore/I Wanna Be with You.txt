I try, but I can't seem to get myself to think of anything but you
Your breath on my face, your warm gentle kiss, I taste the truth
I taste the truth

You know what I came here for
So I won't ask for more

I wanna be with you
If only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms who holds you tight
I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you

So I'll hold you tonight like I would if you were mine
To hold forever more
And I'll savor each touch that I wanted so much to feel before
To feel before

How beautiful it is
Just to be like this
You might also like
I wanna be with you
If only for a night
To be the one who's in your arms who holds you tight
I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
I wanna be with you

Oh, baby
I can't fight this feeling anymore
It drives me crazy when I try to
So call my name
Take my hand
And make my wish
Baby, your command

Yeah
I wanna be with you
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing else I want more than to feel this way
(I wanna be) I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you (Yeah)
(I wanna be with you) I wanna be
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be)
(I wanna be)
(I wanna be with you) Yeah
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be, I wanna be, baby
I wanna be
(I wanna be with you)
I wanna be with you, yeah
