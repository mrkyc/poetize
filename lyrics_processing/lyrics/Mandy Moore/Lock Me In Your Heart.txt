Mandy, Mandy
The sound of your voice Is sweet like candy

There was a time when I was all alone
Waiting for someone I could call my own
I closed my eyes and dreamt you up one day
My prince of charms would ride up and we'd fly away

Take me to a place
Where the magic between us becomes real
Take me all the way

Boy, I want you to
Lock me in your heart
And throw away the key
Show me love; the way it's supposed to be
Lock me in your heart and never let me go
I must confess
You are the best
So baby, come take me
(Take me, baby, take me away)
(Take me, baby, take me away)
You might also like
We'll dance together
Where no one can see
With you alone
Is where I wanna me
Uncharted territory we'll discover
You'll always be my dream lover, ooh

Take me to a place
Where the magic between us becomes real
Take me all the way

Boy, I want you to
Lock me in your heart
And throw away the key
Show me love; the way it's supposed to be
Lock me in your heart And never let me go (And let me go)
I must confess
You are the best

Yes, you are the best
So baby come take me
Lock me in your heart
Oh baby oh baby
Lock me in your heart
So baby come take me
Take me to a place
Where the magic between us
So real
Take me all the way
Boy, I want you to
Lock me in your heart
And throw away the key
Show me love; the way it's supposed to be
Lock me in your heart And never let me go (And let me go)
I must confess
You are the best
Boy I want you to
Lock me in your heart
And throw away the key
Show me love andthe way it's supposed to be
Lock me in your heart
And never let me go
Yes, you are the best
So baby, come take me

Take me, baby, take me away
Take me, baby, take me away
Take me, baby, take me away
Take me, baby, take me away
Take me, baby, take me away
