Oh, oh, oh, oh

I know you've tried your best
But that's not good enough for me
Understand, nevertheless
Love's gotta go both ways
Well you push me to the left then you push me to the right
But you gotta meet in the middle
If you wanna make this right
But you gotta believe
So here it is (Here it is, baby, here it is)

I wanna help you out
Tell you what it's all about
What I feel, what I need
How it's gonna be
So what you wanna do
What you really wanna do
'Cause I've decided everything I want from you

One sided love
Is never gonna work
So let me tell you something
That I'm sure you never heard of
Tender love and care
In case you're unaware
So, I'll tell you what
Let me tell you where it's at
Hit me with your best shot
You might also like
I'm giving you a second chance
But you gotta understand
If you don't know how to love me
I will find someone who can
So read my lips for the last time
I tell you now with no regret
If you don't get your act together
Even your name I will forget
But you gotta believe
So here it is (Here it is, baby, here it is)

I wanna help you out
Tell you what it's all about
What I feel, what I need
How it's gonna be
So what you wanna do
What you really wanna do
'Cause I decide everything that I want from you

One sided love
Is never gonna work
So let me tell you something
That I'm sure you never heard of
Tender love and care
In case you're unaware
So, I'll tell you what
Let me tell you where it's at
Hit me with your best shot
Oh, oh, oh
Ohh
Hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot

One sided love
One sided love
Is never gonna work
So let me tell you something
That I'm sure you never heard of
Tender love and care
In case you're unaware
So, I'll tell you what
Let me tell you where it's at
Oh, baby
One sided love
Is never gonna work
So let me tell you something
That I'm sure you never heard of
Tender love and care
In case you're unaware
So, I'll tell you what
Let me tell you where it's at
