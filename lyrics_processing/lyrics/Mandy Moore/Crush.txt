Oh-oh, yeah yeah yeah
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)

You know, everything that I'm afraid of
You do, everything I wish I did
Everybody wants you, everybody loves you
I know, I should tell you how I feel
I wish, everyone would disappear
Every time you call me, I'm too scared to be me
And I'm too shy to say

Ooh, I got a crush on you
I hope you feel the way that I do
I get a rush when I'm with you
Ooh, I've got a crush on you
A crush on you

You know, I'm the one that you can talk to
Sometimes, you tell me things that I don't wanna know
I just wanna hold you
You say, exactly how you feel about her
I wonder, could you ever think of me that way?
(I got a, I got a)

I got a crush on you
I hope you feel the way that I do
I get a rush when I'm with you
Ooh, I've got a crush on you
A crush on you

Ooh, I wish I could tell somebody
But there's no one to talk to, nobody knows
I've got a crush on you
A crush on you, I got a crush
(Hey, ey, ey, ey, ey) I got a crush, I got a crush on you

You say, everything that no one says
But I feel, everything that you're afraid to feel
I will always want you, I will always love you

I got a crush on you
I hope you feel the way that I do
I get a rush when I'm with you
Ooh, I've got a crush on you
A crush on you
I got a crush on you
I hope you feel the way that I do
I get a rush when I'm with you
Ooh, I've got a crush on you
I got a crush, I got a crush on you
