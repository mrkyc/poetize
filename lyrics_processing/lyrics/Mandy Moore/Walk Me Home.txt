Walk me home
I don't wanna go all the way alone
Baby, would you walk with me home?
Baby, would you take my hand?
Come with me now to a special land
Baby, would you walk with me home?
Oh

3AM
You're on my mind once again
I must've been dreaming
Thought I felt your heartbeat just then

And I wondered how it would be
If I was your lady
And you were my friend
I would put my heart in your hands
And it would never end

Baby, would you walk me home? (Walk me home)
I don't wanna go all the way alone (All alone)
Baby, would you walk with me home?
Baby, would you take my hand? (Take my hand)
Come with me now to a special land (Oh, oh)
Baby, would you walk with me home?

Ohh, ohhh, oh

I hold your picture
Next to my heart all the time
Ohh, yeah, baby
You're my dream come true
So glad you're mine

And I wondered how it would be
If I was your lady
And you were my friend
I would put my heart in your hands
And it would never end

Baby, would you walk me home? (Walk me home)
I don't wanna go all the way alone (All alone)
Baby, would you walk with me home?
Baby, would you take my hand? (Take my hand)
Come with me now to a special land
Baby, would you walk with me home?
Every day and night I wanna hold you (Hold you)
Understand, I am gonna love you
In my own special way (In my own special way)

Baby, would you walk me home? (Walk me home)
I don't wanna go all the way alone (All alone)
Baby, would you walk with me home?
Baby, would you take my hand?
Come with me now to a special land
Baby, would you walk with me home?
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Baby, would you walk me home? (Walk me home)
I don't wanna go all the way alone (All alone)
Baby, would you walk with me home?
