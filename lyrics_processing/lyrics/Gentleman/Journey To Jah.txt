The road is dusty, but the rain will fall soon.
We are tradin da valley from the sun till a moon.
What will we be if we just locked up inna room.
YoYo Woah!
So many challenges ah put you to de test.
Driving mile after mile you've got no time to rest.
Hounded devotion ah you never give no less.
And everyday you surrounded by stress.
Crossing border, divine is de order.
Now I'm on my journey, on my journey to jah jah.
YoYo,
And now is the time when we don't wait no more.
Divine is de order, (We liberate de border)
And now I'm on my journey, on my journey to jah jah!
YoYo,
And now is the time when we don't wait no more! (No more)
You movin' hard and tryin' everything to reach
and still you feel like you movin' inna cycle of senselessness. (YoYo)
So confusing are the doctrins dem teach,
we no really find no meaning inna de words that the preachers preach.
Over the bridge you gonna reach and run about,
there's no sign you will find so you must figure it out.
Left, Right, outward you trample and you doubt,
while you travel east, west, north and south.
Crossing border, divine is de order.
Now I'm on my journey, on my journey to jah jah.
YoYo,
And now is the time when we don't wait no more.
Divine is de order, (We liberate de border)
And now I'm on my journey, on my journey to jah jah!
YoYo,
And now is the time when we don't wait no more! (No more)
(On my journey!)
Modern Wisdom, ancient philosophies.
It's your decision and you choose who you want to be.
Head and shoulder now we rise to our destiny.
Find the courage to be free!
YoYo Woah!
Manifest jah work, we can't deny the mystery.
Affi take it further, Stop repeating history.
Inna constant search of your lost, identity.
Look over and you will see! (Woah!)
Crossing border, divine is de order.
Now I'm on my journey, on my journey to jah jah.
YoYo,
And now is the time when we don't wait no more.
Divine is de order, (We liberate de border)
