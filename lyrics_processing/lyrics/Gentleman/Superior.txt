You, remember wha Garnet a sing?
If you know not God, you know not love, no no
If you know not Jah, 'coz God is love
 (x2)
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold

Somebody tell me
'Coz I really got to know, oh, oh
I read a lot of history
But things nuh really show, no, no
Why dem drop the bombs ina Arabia?
Why the children bawl and suffer ina Africa?
Leaders of the world just fighting for superpower
But judgment ago fall upon dem head, like rain shower
Mi go so then
 (x2)
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold
You might also like
So you betta love the likkle youths
Nuh terrorize dem oh, no, no, no
Teach the youths the truth
Nuh criticize dem oh, no, no, no
Open up your eyes and realize then
You Hafi, keep youh Hafi, care you Hafi guide dem
Don't you know war and crime will divide dem?
Now you betta show the youth your fears
And don't you hide dem
And then equality and justice will unite dem
Lift up your voice and you got to sing the anthem
We go so then
 (x2)
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold

Long time we fed up a your promises and lies
Your illusion and religion just covering our eyes, yo
Frustration a starvation multiply
Depression until the well a run dry
Can't you show the love man and not the animosity?
Can't you live a life how it is said in Deuteronomy?
Me coulda be your friend, why you want to be my enemy?
You can't tek dem speed Jah over yah
So, so come follow we come follow we
 (x2)
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold

Somebody tell me
'Coz I really got to know, oh, oh
I read a lot of history
But tings nuh really show, no, no
Why dem drop the bombs ina Arabia?
Why the children bawl and suffer ina Africa?
Leaders of the world just fighting for superpower
But judgment ago fall upon dem head like rain shower, ooh

I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
