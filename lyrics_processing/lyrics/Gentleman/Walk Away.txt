As long as there's life, oh yes we know there is hope
We found a way to survive, we still ah travel the road
And we can always decide to find a way how to cope
The journey's long and it's wide cause time is longer than a rope

Certain tings might go 'pon your nerves
And dem do you tings what you just don't deserve
G'wan tell di world a blessing over curse
One day, the last will be the first
Full speed forward, you just can't reverse
Uplift yourself when dem expect di worse
Hear wha me say in ah di verse
It's time to leave, time to quench your spiritual thirst

Put down the trouble then you walk away
You don't have to fight today
No, you nuh fi do it again nuh do it again
You do it from way back when
Put down the trouble then you walk away
You don't have to fight today
No, you nuh fi do it again nuh do it again
You do it from way back when
You might also like
Put down di trouble then you walk from dem
Trouble making people take no talk from dem
New life, new chapter, new time and friend
You ah follow yuh instinct, you just can't pretend
A brand new start you will find again
Nuh make nobody interrupt you this time again
One piece of mind, clear mind again
Everything incline again, love it you'll shine again

Put down the trouble then you walk away
You don't have to fight today
No, you nuh fi do it again nuh do it again
You do it from way back when
Put down the trouble then you walk away
You don't have to fight today
No, you nuh fi do it again nuh do it again
You do it from way back when

Me nuh tell you fi take this honor
Offer yuh life, can do what you wanna
But if you draw fi the guns and the ammo
Next ting me know, you ah go draw fi di bomber
Take a check and sort out yuh grammar
Sentence nuh right, boy you need a few comma
But if you don't stop talk and stammer
Den you ah fi talk in front of yuh honor
Put down the trouble then you walk away
You don't have to fight today
No, you nuh fi do it again nuh do it again
You do it from way back when
Put down the trouble then you walk away
You don't have to fight today
No, you nuh fi do it again nuh do it again
You do it from way back when

Certain tings might go 'pon your nerves
And dem do you tings what you just don't deserve
