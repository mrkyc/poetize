So much things we've been waiting for
Obstacles come around what dem hating for
You and I together there's no breaking 'cause we overjoyed
When I hold you in my arms
I'm so captivated so fascinated by your charm
And no one can break it and Jah Jah will take us through the storm
And even when it's cold outside I'll be there to keep you warm
Hey baby girl you know that I love you
Hey can you feel the chemistry when I hug you
You know I'll never put another girl above you
And I know I'll never find another love like you
And if I'm gone for a minute or few
Nobody think me ago leave you out in the dew
I'll never leave you lonely girl I'll never make you blue
You know I'd love to
Hold you in my arms
I'm so captivated so fascinated by your charm
And no one can break it and Jah Jah will take us through the storm
And even when it's cold outside I'll be there to keep you warm
Remembering those days what we call the undercover time
We couldn't make a link we couldn't say see you another time
Back in the days when I wish you were mine
And I would have been in custody if loving was a crime
We persevere and now we push it into overtime
Songs and secret letters add up more than to a thousand lines
Ring pon your finger now look how it a shine I'm glad to say
When I hold you in my arms
I'm so captivated so fascinated by your charm
And no one can break it and Jah Jah will take us through the storm
And even when it's cold outside I'll be there to keep you warm
You re beautiful and skin soft like a cotton
For you I fight a war I woulda fight any battle
And nuff a try fi tear we down but that nuh go happen
And this love won't be forgotten
We live the life we love and love the life we a live
And what's interesting about us we learn to forgive
We coming from a far and now we cross over the bridge and
That's just the way it is
So much things we've been waiting for
Obstacles come around what dem hating for
You and I together there's no breaking 'cause we overjoyed
When I hold you in my arms
I'm so captivated so fascinated by your charm
And no one can break it andJ ah Jah will take us through the storm
