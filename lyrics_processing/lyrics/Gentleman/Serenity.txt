And da one who want deny
Soon cry a river of tears
Long time now we livin in a fear
Something new fi try
Press gas find another gear
Why you wanna throw it all away
Now you about to hurt yourself
It is happening here there and everywhere
Man a left from the spiritual wealth
Find out who you are
Hear the sound from a far
Forget about your try along crosses
So much emotional scar
From that tug-a-war
But every tribulation passes...
Serenity and love in a the air
And da one who want deny
Soon cry a river of tears
Long time now we livin in a fear
Something new fi try
Press gas find another gear
Serenity and love in a the air
And da one who want deny
Soon cry a river of tears
Long time now we livin in a fear
Something new fi try
Press gas find another gear
