Strophe 1: Gentleman
I live my life as a humble man
Nuh try fi do no wrong
But all the good that I can
I'm inspired by the higher one
The only one
And that is my tradition
Gunshot round the corner it a echo a echo
The cowboy over ya so with him a lasso a lasso
The rootsman over ya deh so nuh go leggo nuh leggo
Know see that him life it couldn't go so
Chorus
What you really bargain for you
Nuh think about the children of tomorrow
Tell me what you searching for
What you really bargain for you
Nuh think about the children of tomorrow
Tell me what you searching for

I trod daily pon the frontline
And I still see signs of memories left behind
Keep my faith and I meditate
I penetrate mount Zion gate
No matter what dem do no matter what dem say
Me hafi keep moving on pon the righteous way
No matter how dem try a spy
I no matter how me keep moving on
And bun dem system every day
Chorus

You nuh think about the children of tomorrow
Tell me what you searching for

You nuh think about the children of tomorrow
Tell me what you searching for
