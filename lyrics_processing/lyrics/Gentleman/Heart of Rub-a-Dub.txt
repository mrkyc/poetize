We play it fast and we playin' it slow
Shelly wants to leave but she just can't go no

She do it cool and deadly inna her dancing shoes
Tonight she is a winner cannot lose
So here we go oh

Birds of a feather like magnet to steel
Big box steel horn with the sublow

Broader than broadways the sounds of Jamaica
