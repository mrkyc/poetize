You nuh see that Jah give we life after all
Check yourself before you wreck yourself
Me see that Jah Jah give we life after all
Still none a dem nuh give no thanks at all
Dem think dem a rise me see dem a fall
Fall dem a fall - fall dem a fall

How long you want to go runaway
Run away from yourself you nuh see that truth ago reveal
And every day you got to pray - well that you fi go do
And make your life one a the real
How long you want to go runaway
Run away from yourself you nuh see that truth ago reveal
And every day you got to pray
You got to pray, you got to pray
How you fi expect love and you still a glorifie the gun
How you want clarity if acoke you nuh stop bun
Your dirty lifestyle nuh give you no way to turn
You still nuh realize that you wrong
After you come out of your church you beat your babymother down
And then you tell her you're sorry but your head did full a rum
She couldn't take your excuse and your flattering tongue
That's why she left you today and still a ask
