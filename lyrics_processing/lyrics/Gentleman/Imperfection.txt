Do you prefer holding back or say what you wanna say?
Do you prefer meditation or prefer to pray?
When there is a situation, do you run away?
Troubles of your mind
Would you rather be free or make your bed in a cage?
Do you judge a book and never open the page?
Are you ready to cool it, are you holding your rage?
Troubles of your mind

'Cause we're only human
With imperfections
'Cause there is a time and a place for everything
We're only human, yeah

Are you gonna look back and say that you never lived?
Expect to receive but then you don't wanna give
Your conscience on vacation, your heart is a drift
Troubles of your mind
Are you willing and able help fixin' this place?
Or are you givin' up and want move out of space?
I know you know what I'm sayin', I see the look on your face
Troubles of your mind
So we still a hold a joy, still a hold a vibe, still a show love, we nuh crazy
Hundred percent nuh compromize, this a nuh-nuh if, this a nuh maybe (Yeah)
Always found a way, stay strong and member no need to be shady
And we nuh show love once a year on occasion, it shoulda be daily
