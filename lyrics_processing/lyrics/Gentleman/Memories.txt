And I will always respect you
Thank you Jah for everything
And I bless the very, very day I met you
'Cause everything have reason
Like every time have season
Things go round in cycle circle
Don't know why, but they can hurt you
The sadness won't fade away
No it won't go away
It's funny how memories don't leave like people do
That's why I have to say
I'm making this point today
It's funny how memories don't leave like people do, noo
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you before we departed
Now things are not the same
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you, I wish I coulda told you
I remember when we used to cooperate
We had one aim you never hesitate
And nothing wha me do you nuh underrate
You was a true friend, memories won't evaporate
Tragedy we never anticipate
It's like a dream and yet I am wide awake
Some genuine vibes we generate
And now I'm gonna show you how much I appreciate

And still could call your name
If I coulda told you before we departed
Now things are not the same
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you, I wish I coulda told you
We used to share the same dream, same goal
One team, a so we used to roll
No separation, manipulation, allegation
Because you was a very good soul
One aim, one heart, one God
And we used to have the same thought
No limitation to inspiration, motivation
Sadness won't fade away
No it won't go away
It's funny how memories don't leave like people do
That's why I have to say
I'm making this point today
