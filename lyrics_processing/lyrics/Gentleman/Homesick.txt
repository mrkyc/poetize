Homesick for a place you've never seen before
You love life but you can't find a key to it's store
Where is the smile up on your face?
You livin in disgrace
You runnin but dem wrong things you chase yeah
I'm not sayin anything you've never heard before
But i hope this time it's i go reach to your core
And now we can find ways again
To keep things under control
Straight forward no waste time again
Movements got a stone after all
The torch and the light and the flame
The goodness in you to unchain
No more you are livin in vain
Turn another page it won't be the same no
Chorus:
And everybody's journey is their own
If i take a lead and no fallout
Now it's time to get up from the ground
Got to have the strength and no stall out
Verse 2:
And you trying not to see the mess around you
But everyweher you turn it seems to outbound you
In the mixup with the demoms them surround you
There is nothing they can do to stop the love that has found you
Now the light and the truth can go around
Push out to the limit the word power and sound
Now the fears and the doubts will go down
Contagious all over the town

And everybody's journey is their own
If i take a lead and no fallout
Now it's time to get up from the ground
Got to have the strength and no stall out
Verse 3 :
Take the invitation to trouble your soul
Sick of navigation untill you find out your own
It might be unconfortable go ahead and be a rebel
On your hours feel yourself miserable
Now is the time to live life before you go old
There is a fire inside you dont make it go cold
And now we can find ways again
To keep things under control
Straight forward no waste time again
Movements got stone after all
The torch and the light and the flame
The goodness in you to unchain
No more you are livin in vain
Turn another page it won't be the same no
Chorus:
And everybody's journey is their own
If i take a lead and no fallout
Now it's time to get up from the ground
