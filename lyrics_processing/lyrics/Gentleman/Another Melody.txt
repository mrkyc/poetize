But it takes a little something
And then it gives a little something
Just read the writings on the wall
And then receive a little something
Remember to give something
Rude boy the war could over
But you still buss that gun people run for cover
If you take your time you'll discover
Without the noise oh yes we could rejoice
The taking of a life does it bring you joy
When the only thing what happen that we self destroy
In the making of great undertaking
Vision forsaking knees them keep shaking
Life Could be a sweet refrain
But the only thing we feel is pain
Whe whole world a feel it so how do we heal it
Instead a we wheel it make we seal it
And as we looking through the picture frame
Another melody we must maintain
The whole world a feel it so how do we heal it
Instead a we wheel it make we seal it
And we heal not by building on lies
But by replacing this synthetic life
With something more appealing
Pray for it everytime we're kneeling
Only then can we soar above
Every gwaan whey a block the love
We all wanna be feeling
Instead of this hatred that we're dealing
You might also likeLife could be a sweet refrain
But the only thing we feel is pain
Whe whole world a feel it so how do we heal it
Instead a we wheel it make we seal it
And as we looking through the picture frame
Another melody we must maintain
The whole world a feel it so how do we heal it
Instead a we wheel it make we seal it
What will it take for peace threat to sign again
And what we seek inside seems hard to find mi friend
Keep on pushing to the end
Broke down de barriers
Get up and make we pop down dem fence
Tired of being a victim in the making
Tired of sitting, waiting, smiling when i'm aching
Not happy but i'm faking
Underneath the veneer oh my heart is breaking now
Life could be a sweet refrain
But the only thing we feel is pain
Whe whole world a feel it so how do we heal it
Instead a we wheel it make we seal it
And as we looking through the picture frame
Another melody we must maintain
The whole world a feel it so how do we heal it
Instead a we wheel it make we seal it
You say you want a lot more love fi grow
But everytime you plant all the seed and it don't sow
Can't blame you cause you just do what you do
All the ignorance will come fi over throw
I know it seems like your hearing the same word
It sounds cliche but it still as sure
As the first time you heard it
Make no mistake we're all allergic to the verdict
So come make we start to change
Big fat lies have been told
Got to watch yourself or get caught
Ina dem cyber control
Don't you lose the side of your goal
Meditate and sweep over your soul
Life Could be a sweet refrain
But the only thing we feel is pain
Whe whole world a feel it so how do we heal it
Instead a we wheel it make we seal it
And as we looking through the picture frame
Another melody we must maintain
The whole world a feel it so how do we heal it
