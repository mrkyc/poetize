No more time to waste
And you know just wat to do
Leaving out the old
And picking up the new
And there is nothing to replace
Cause it's all inside of you (changes)
Mind finally awake
And you nah sleep no more
Now you know the dept of yourself
And even more in store
You have been rich
And you thought you were so poor (changes)

I can see the rain
Falling on my window pane
Hear this voice again
Don't worry bout tomorrow no
We wouldn't feel the same
This is to erase the pain
Hear this voice again
Go build a betta tomorrow yeah

Seems like there's no justice
Me hear dem bawling out for peace
And a war dem a practice
Find di code mek we crack dis
Nah go feel no way
Breaking out today
Di system attract dis
Corrupt mi mind
But you cya touch mi soul
Humble as a lamb
But like a lion me roar
Me nah read yuh script
And me nah play yuh roll
Caz me see di fool has never been told
Soh me sing again
You might also like

Falling on my window pane
Hear this voice again
Don't worry bout tomorrow no
We wouldn't feel the same

See dem and recruit
And you know we nah go join dem
Eyes wide open
So we see between di line dem
Treseaurs well hidden
But we know where to find dem
Be not afraid
Speak wat is on your mind den
Mount lef and clear
Very hard to define dem
From any indecision
Yeah we need to decline dem
Take wat is yours
And leave wat is mine then
Living one day at a time den
I can see the rain
Falling on my window pane
Hear this voice again
Don't worry bout tomorrow no
We wouldn't feel the same
This is to erase the pain
Hear this voice again
Go build a betta tomorrow yeah
