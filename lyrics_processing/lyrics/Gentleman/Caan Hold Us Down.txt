Not even dem pagan sound
No powers gonna hold us down
You'll never see we wearing a frown (wearing a frown)
I've been chanting Jah powers from morning
Truths and rights I man keep performing
I hear the Babylon bell how it alarming
Dem see a righteous ghetto youth and ready fi swarm him
Dem shoulda overstand the power whe Jah storm bring (oh yes)
When it blow the whole a dem haffi go calm king
Long time we did a issue 'bout the warning
We ago hold Lucifer and disarm him

Ey, a what at them man, Daddy Rings..
Dem think we fool but we tell dem seh we not
Caan make no wolf come invate the flag
Nuh get caught inna no booby trap
I and I a royal Natty Dreadlock
Well as the sun shine and the wind blow
(That's how I know, that's how I know)
I take a look through, my window
(That's how I know, that's how I know)
If you nuh know the truth yourself, you are deceiving
Trumpet a sound and I man is leaving
Higher ground that is where I am going
Too bless to stress, can't stop me from growing
No powers gonna hold us down
Not even dem pagan sound
No powers gonna hold us down
You'll never see we wearing a frown (wearing a frown)
