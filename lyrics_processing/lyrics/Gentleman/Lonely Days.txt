This love feel so real
So real, so real
You know that I will always be around
Just keep your feet on solid ground
Never will I make you frown
You talk 'bout those lonely days
Can't't stand it being on your own
Tell me 'bout your lonely days
But don't you worry
I'm coming back home
You talking 'bout lonely days
Can't stand it being by yourself
Tell me 'bout your lonely days
You need me and no one else
I understand every word you say
And I've tried my best not to stay away from you
We had come a long way
And I never regret a moment I spent with you
And I will never give you up
No matter what people may say
Or what dem wanna do
I know that you miss my touch
Just relax for a moment baby girl
