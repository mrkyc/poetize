(You remember) When we used to write letters and we never used to send text messages
(You remember) When there was no Facebook, no Youtube, never invade the colleges
(You remember) That technology's a good thing but many misuse it and cause peer damages
The future is so great we can't forget the past
I'm passionate about this memory, I got this feeling
Question to the leaders and me ask them what them dealin'
They say that the world need a spiritual healin'
What about the youth that we leavin'?
Cyberspace take their mind only that them a believe in
The elders get bitter so them stop from teachin'
Miles from the youth than how you ever reach them
Tell me how you ever reach them
Bridge:
We remembering the past but if there wasn't the past just remember that there wouldn't be no future
So I say it with all costs on your behalf just like how Christ died for the youths, ya'
That's just a moment in time to mesmerize your mind you better acknowledge the truth, ya'
If your objective is crime you keep being unkind then your own weapon will shoot ya'
Chorus:
(You remember) When we used to write letters and we never used to send text messages
(You remember) When there was no Facebook, no Youtube never invade the colleges
(You remember) That technology's a good thing but many misuse it and cause peer damages
The future is so great we can't forget the past
You might also likeCertain good things happen in the past
Now everything change, everybody move fast (move fast)
And the youths, me see them act like them lost
Everybody wanna' be a rebel without a cause
You remember when we coulda' hence out
And a roll down south everybody coulda' roll all about
Now the tension so high like it want touch the sky
'Dem a plan now, fi try get you out
Mannerism is depleted, the past is deleted
'Dem fi know life's more than a flaas
And the children used to listen to the teacher
Now the children 'dem a gwaan like 'dem a the teacher of the class
'Dem used to say thank you and good morning
Now not even question a ask
But you can't blame the youth cause they don't know the truth
There is no one to help 'dem stick to the task
Chorus:
(You remember) When we used to write letters and we never used to send text messages
(You remember) When there was no Facebook, no Youtube never invade the colleges
(You remember) That technology's a good thing but many misuse it and cause peer damages
