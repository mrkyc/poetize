So many rise so many fall
So many standing in the middle of despair
Nobody care nobody see it clear
Dem blinded by society
And now dem can't see the quality
Me see dem limited capacity
Verbal verbosity
And dem ignorant atrocity
Can't you see it's right there
So tell me what a cause so much damn poverty
Tell me why the people dem a lose gravity
It caused by a handful of minority
Who try to pull down the majority
Well this is up to you and me
Make we sit down and talk bout long drivity
Sit down and reason conscious livity
Our natural ability
Give thanks for diversity
It no pretty out there at all
So many rise so many fall
So many standing in the middle of despair
Nobody care nobody see it clear
