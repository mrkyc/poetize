Baby your love has got me under your spell
And I got plans to keep you here with me for life
Don't stop what your doing 'cause you do it so well
There's nothing wrong with getting your loving every night

(So don't change, a thing)
Baby I want this love I'm feeling last forever
(Just stay, the same)
And I want you for the rest of my life

It's just the way you make me feel
When I'm making love to you
I'm out of my mind (out of my mind)
It's just the things you do
When I'm making love to you
I'm satisfied (so satisfied)

I don't want to lose your loving
I'd give anything for you to have it all your way
Baby I'm always thinking of you
I see nothing wrong with giving your loving everyday
