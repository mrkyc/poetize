Girl, I know you're scared of love

Ooh, don't worry, baby girl, 'cause I got it bad for you
You won't hurt no more
It's okay if your heart ain't ready
But, girl, I can't leave you alone
And I know that you've been hittin' with these clowns
That ain't treating you right
I'm the type of guy that don't make promises
I wanna be the love of your life
Don't be scared

Ooh, I admit I used to be the same fool that you're scared of
Out of control
Tried to hit every woman that I came in contact with
Out on the road
But I got it out of my system, girl
I did that when I was young
I need somebody that's gon' hold me down
Cross my heart, you'll be the only one
Don't be scared

Girl, I'll love you every minute
Ooh, girl, there's no doubt about it
You just can't keep running from love
Ooh, girl, I'm willing to show
Properly, you an adult, not poison
Ooh, take a chance and give me your love
Baby, only good love, baby, don't you be
