She's got a man, another situation
I understand that's how it's got to be
Ain't trying to cause her no complications
I'd walk away, but I'm in too deep
I can't make no plans, got me so frustrated
Cause in my heart I want you desperately
Done ran away from all the girls I've been dating
When I'm with them, it's only you I see
And she promised me that it would take some time
But she would leave him alone
And the thought of her loving only me
That's the thing that keeps me strong

She give me all her love
But only half the time
Still it's more than enough
To keep my hope alive

Just yesterday I saw them shopping at the mall
Looked like she tried on a diamond ring
The way he held her down, it drove me crazy
Spent half the day wishing that it was me
I can't make no plans, got me so frustrated
Cause in my heart I want you desperately
Done ran away from all the girls I've been dating
When I'm with them, it's only you I see
And she promised me that it would take some time
But she would leave him alone
And the thought of her loving only me
That's the thing that keeps me strong
You might also like
She give me all her love
But only half the time
Still it's more than enough
To keep my hope alive

A secret rendezvous, just to spend time with you
Girl, I need you in my life
And if I had to choose, the thought would still be you
Just as long as...

She give me all her love
But only half the time
Still it's more than enough
To keep my hope alive

She give me all her love
And it's enough for me, cause I'm never gonna leave, and
She gives me all love
And it's enough for me, cause I'm never gonna leave, and
Ooh, said I'm never gonna leave
I've been getting all your love, half the time, oh no...
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
She give me all her love
But only half the time
Still it's more than enough
To keep my hope alive

Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
