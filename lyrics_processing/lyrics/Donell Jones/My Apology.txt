Oh why oh why oh why you let me do the things I do
(But you never did it to me?)
I can't believe that I could treat my baby so uncool
(All she ever wanted was me)
Many nights I watched her cry from silly shit I put her through
(Like havin' females callin' the crib)
Wish that I could just rewind all the years I hurt ya, boo
Oh yeah

It's the Gemini in me
Got split personalities (Ooh yeah)
It's Dr. Jekyll and Hyde with me
I'm a provider, G
Bills paid on the first you see
You keep a pocket full of currency
You said you'd never leave
Now you tryna turn your back on me
I understand you got no trust in me
But I'll change for you
If you promise that you'll stay with me
Please accept my apology

Looking back I know that I physically neglected you
('Cause we wasn't havin' no sex)
Many years screamed and yelled, rantin' and ravin' like a fool, oh yeah
(Mentally abusing you)
I hope it's something left inside 'cause, girl, I wanna be with you
(Got to know I'm willing to change)
Wish that I could just rewind all the years I hurt you, boo
