(If you want)
Yeah
(If you want)
Tonight
I dont want you to think about none of the problems you got going on, baby
(If you want)
Now if your man ain't lovin' you right
You need to roll with a G
Get a thug in your life
I got the coupe outside and it's sittin' on chrome
Baby girl, you ain't gotta go home
Yo, tell her, Jones

(If you want)
You ain't gotta leave
You can just stay right here
(If you want)
Kiss it one time
Promise, baby, I won't tell
(If you want)
Damn what your boyfriend say
You ain't gotta go nowhere
(If you want)
Here is where you wanna be
Sittin' on top right here
You might also like
Uh, unlock your door
Girl, I wanna knock it down
You know what I'm saying
No more playin' around
I can make you feel like you need to
On the bed, we can do it every night
Don't front if you're feelin' right
We can do it anyhow you want
I just want you to feel at home

(If you want)
You ain't ever gotta go home to your man
(If you want)
You can stay here, you know that you can
(If you want) If you want it, baby
Girl, I know you want it so bad
(If you want, I got what you want, what you wanted)
Said I got what you wanted (What you wanted)

If you wanna walk around my house with nothin' on
(If you want)
You ain't gotta ask me first or hesitate to take it off
(If you want)
And no matter how many times he call
You ain't gotta get that phone
(If you want)
I know what you wanna do now that we're here alone
Hey! Unlock your door
Girl, I wanna knock it down
You know what I'm sayin'
No more playin' around
I can make you feel like you need to
On the bed, we can do it every night
Don't front if you're feelin' right
We can do it anyhow you want
I just want you to feel at home
If you want
You ain't ever gotta go home to your man
You ain't gotta go home
If you want
You can stay here, you know that you can
Said baby, you know that you can
If you want
Girl, I know you want it so bad
If you want I got what you want, you know that you want it

(If you want)
Well, you can sit back, relax and chill
Unwind and spend time with the king of the trill
(If you want)
Baby, you can let down your hair
And kick off your shoes off, girl, we ain't goin' nowhere
(If you want)
Mami, I can make your dreams come true
Fulfill your fantasies, whatever you wanna do
Baby girl, I ain't scared to please ya
Matter fact, I'm prepared to please ya
Let me ease your body, and your mind
Let me pull you closer, and slow grind
Lookin' at your figure, you're so fine
Losin' my composure, in no time
I'm givin' you all you want, baby, all you can take
Making love 'til the headboard break
And shorty wanna ride with me, then let me know 'cause we ridin'
Just open the door and let your boy Bun slide in
Back rub (I got it)
Big tub (I got it)
We'll do, whatever you want, ooh yeah
No doubt (About it)
I'll bang (Your body)
Girl, I want you to feel at home

If you want
You ain't ever gotta go home to your man

If you want
You can stay here, you know that you can
Stay right here, my lady
