Got me groove on, Got to make a move on
Girl I got what you need so baby don't be
Giving me no static when I creeping up the phone
Let me show you what I made of
Verse 1:
Don't be afraid girl I'm gonna give you what you want
Baby there is no need to front
Gotta know that I'm gonna be the one
To give you love and whatever you need
Girl I'm hoping you can see that its only you for me
Never know what you can have unless you take it there
The love that I got Girl I can share
There is no other love who can compare
Do all the things I have here right in store for you
So many things to do
Give me your love and I will make it true
Chorus:
Got me groove on, Got to make a move on
Girl I got what you need so baby don't be
Giving me no static when I creeping up the phone
Let me show you what I made of
Verse 2
I wanna show you I can love totally
Its not gonna cost you anything but a trip to ecstasy
I'm all the man but you gotta believe
That your love for me will grow
But only time will surely show
Baby take my hand and let me lead you to your dream
I will fulfill your fantasy cause I wanna be your everything
I will make your heart feel like its brand new
So many things to do
Give me your love and I will make it true

Gonna do you right keep you satisfied
If you give this love a try
If you fall in love with me then finally you can see
Won't do you wrong, my word is bond, love to the break of dawn
Girl I'll never do your wrong cause you got it going on
Be a part of me, never thought you need, cause I'm thinking abut destiny
If you want destiny let your mind soon be free
No Need to fear I'm gonna take you where there is nothing but love to share
And there is no need to fear cause I got it right here
