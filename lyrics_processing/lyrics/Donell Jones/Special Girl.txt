(I'm looking for that special girl, that special girl)
All ya single ladies that look out for me
I'm the hottest single nigga to step on the scene
Got the east side rockin'
Got the mid west talking
Got the dirty south bouncin'
Got the west crib talking
The type a nigga that you wanna roll with baby
Dont get it twisted thinkin' i'm a sugar daddy
You can look like Halle with an ass like JLO
And a smile like Janet but that's not enough
You may think that i'm tripping take a minute and just listen
It ain't all about sex cause I can always get that
I'm a million dollar nigga need a million dollar woman
Met this chick named Yvett and this what she said

I can give you everything you need
I can be your freak, even cook and clean
If thats all you got then you cannot get it
Cause I got a chef who can cook all my dinners
I'm looking for that nigga who ain't cheap
Take me shopping every week
