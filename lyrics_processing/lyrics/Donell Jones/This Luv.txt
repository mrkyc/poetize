Boo, do you mind if I take this seat right here
Cause you're sitting alone
If you're sipping on Cris' girl, I'm buying, yeah
And if you got a nigga don't lie
Ain't got to front for me
I will give you these digits that you can call
You can hit me on my cell if I'm not home

Are you down to swing enough with me
Or could you be blinded by all this ice you see
I'm willing to give you all this love I got
No relationship involved
Gotta keep it strictly physical
All this love

All this love waiting just for you
So don't pass it up cause you'll regret it boo (say word, yeah)
I'll be patiently waiting to hear from you
Girl, you gotta be the one
Girl, you gotta be the one
Yeah, yeah, yeah

See, I don't mind making house calls
If you wanna go blow for blow
Girl, whatever you're down for, I'm trying
It won't hurt him if he don't know
That's how it's got to be
I understand you got a nigga that lives at home
But I want to be the cat that makes you moan
