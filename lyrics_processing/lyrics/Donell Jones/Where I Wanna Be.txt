I just left my baby girl a message
Sayin', "I won't be comin' home, I'd rather be alone"
She doesn't fully understand me
'Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time, I can be the man she needs
But there's a lotta lust inside of me and we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need
Some time to be alone

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's cryin' her heart to me, how could you let this be?
I just need time to see where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee
I don't mean to hurt you, baby
Oh, no, no

Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part in a decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
Or think about my life and what matters to me the most?
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not sayin' I'm gone, but I
Have to find what life is like without you
You might also like
But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's cryin' her heart to me, how could you let this be?
I just need time to see where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee
I don't mean to hurt you, baby

Say when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's cryin' her heart to me, how could you let this be?
And I just need time to see where I wanna be
Say when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's cryin' her heart to me, how could you let this be?
And I just need time to see where I wanna be
Say when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
And she's cryin' her heart to me, how could you let this be?
And I just need time to see where I wanna be
Where I wanna be
