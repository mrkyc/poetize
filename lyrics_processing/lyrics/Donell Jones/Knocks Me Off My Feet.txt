I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from my heart told only to the wind
Felt even without being said

I don't wanna bore you with my troubles, yeah
But there's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
And I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you, more and more

We lay beneath the stars under a lover's tree
That seems through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part of me that lives in you
That only our two hearts can find

I don't wanna bore you with my troubles, yeah
But there's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something about your love, yeah
Oh, that makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
And I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
You might also like
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
