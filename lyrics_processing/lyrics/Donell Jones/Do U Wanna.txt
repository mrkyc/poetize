Wassup, baby?
This is a night that you'll never forget
Of all the things that you desire
I got it right here, baby
Guess what?
I'm back
I'm back

Baby, the mood is right and the stars are out tonight
I can't wait 'til you get home
I got some rose petals leadin' to the bedroom door
Where I'm waitin' all alone
With candles lit glass of Perignon
Wanna make you lose control
Girl, I'm tellin' you tonight is yours

All I wanna know is
Do you wanna love me?
Gonna give you reason so you can love me forever, babe
I wanna make love babe
Make your temperature rise until you say it's too hot, babe
Do you wanna feel me?
Touchin' and rubbin' and lovin' all of your body
It's just you and me, baby
Gonna tickle your spot until you tell me to stop, babe
Gon' give it to ya right now
You might also like
Passionate as can be as I softly kiss your ear
I'm gon' give you what you want
Straight to the highest peak let me be your ecstasy
This gon' last the whole night long
As we become one, smell of love is strong
Want you to feel it in your soul
Girl, I'm tellin' you tonight is yours

All I wanna know is
Do you wanna love me?
Gonna give you reason so you can love me forever, babe
I wanna make love babe
Make your temperature rise until you say it's too hot, babe
Do you wanna feel me?
Touchin' and rubbin' and lovin' all of your body
It's just you and me, baby
Gonna tickle your spot until you tell me to stop, babe
Gonna give it to you

Anything you wanna do
Baby girl, I'm willin' to do (What's up, baby?)
On the way to ecstasy (I just wanna touch you) you and me between the sheets (Feel you)
I want the whole world to know I'm givin' youu my heart and soul (You like that?)
(I promise not to miss one spot)
Forever, girl, I wanna see you lyin' here next to me
('Cause this here's gonna last forever)
(And ever)
(And ever)
All I wanna know is
Do you wanna love me?
Gonna give you reason so you can love me forever, babe
I wanna make love, babe
Make your temperature rise until you say it's too hot, babe
Do you wanna feel me?
Touchin' and rubbin' and lovin' all of your body
It's just you and me, baby

Make your temperature rise until you say it's too hot, babe
