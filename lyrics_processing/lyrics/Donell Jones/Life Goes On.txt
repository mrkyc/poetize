Damn, man, I had it all before I got up in here

Girl, I know that you been creepin'
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
It's like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on

Since the day that I got locked up
My life's been different, oh yeah
'Cause she was my soul, my heart, my love, my best friend
I can't understand why
She won't accept my phone calls
Shoulda knew something was wrong
When mama said "Baby, it's time for you to move on"
Now that everything I had is lost and gone

Girl, I know that you been creepin'
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
It's like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
See, but I've come to realize that life goes on
You might also like
See, I never thought that you would
Leave me trapped here all alone
'Cause part of the reason I sit where I am
I was tryin' to provide a home, yeah
See, now I know that I'm not going to be there
Like I used to
But your promise to me was that you never would leave
And that remains to be seen
I guess everything I had is lost and gone, yeah

Girl, I know that you been creepin'
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
It's like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on

See, I had it all
When I was on the streets
I gave you everything, yeah
(Everything that you could want)
Now that I'm locked away
With no where to turn
Now you wanna up and run
(How could you do me wrong?)
All those precious times
That we used to share
Been thrown away
(As far as I can see)
See, I gave my heart and soul
And now you turn away from me
Girl, I know that you been creepin'
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
It's like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on
Girl, I know that you been creepin'
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
It's like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
