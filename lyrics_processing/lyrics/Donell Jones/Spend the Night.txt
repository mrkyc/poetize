Listen girl, it's getting hot in here
And you're making me feel like you wanna do something
Oh girl, what's on your mind?
I can't take much more of this bumpin' and grinding

Don't stop what you're doing to me
Baby girl, you make me want you even more
Act just like you know me, back that ass up on me
We can take this party to my place or yours

All up on me, playin' it close
You ain't stoppin', won't stop rollin'
(You ain't stoppin')
Shorty, what you feelin' like?
You can come and spend the night
All up on me, playin' it close
You ain't stoppin', won't stop rollin'
(You ain't stoppin')
Baby girl, if you like
You can come and spend the night
(Spend the night, spend the night)

That Belvedere got you open up wide
And ooh girl, huh, since we locked eyes
Said it's so surreal that we both cannot fight it, ooh yeah
