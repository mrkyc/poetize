Yo, what's up, boo?
I know you never had a love like this before
But you know
I wanna be that one for you
Yo, Tim and Bob, drop that

And I'm not the average guy 'cause I
Cherish you and I'm lovin' you, baby
I'm tellin' you to single these guys
'Cause you really got my heart
You better hold onto me tight
It's not a dream, it's reality and
If you down you got me for life
'Cause I really love you, girl

And I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong
And I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night
You might also like
Every night I'm treatin' you right
'Cause our chemistry is a mystery
To everyone lookin' from outside
'Cause they want what we have
When I look right in your eyes
I see your soul and I'm the mate, baby
If you down you got me for life
'Cause I really love you, girl

Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin' for the rest of your life?
'Cause I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring
Hope you accept this invitation
Every day will be a celebration
Birthdays, holidays, could feel the same

'Cause I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong
I said I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night
I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong
And I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night
Through the night (Through the night)
When love feels right
I really love you, can't get enough of you
Want you in my life, oh girl
And the stars in the sky so bright
You won't regret it, match made in heaven
Girl, whatever you want me to be

I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong
And I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night
I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong
And I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night
Baby girl, your smile
Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin' for the rest of your life?
'Cause I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring
Hope you accept this invitation
Everyday will be a celebration
Birthdays, holidays, could feel the same

I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong
