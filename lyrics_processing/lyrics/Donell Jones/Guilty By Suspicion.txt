Man, what I'ma say this time?
She already heard the one about staying at work late
I already gave her the script about hanging out with the boys
Guess I messed up this time
I'll face the music

I see that you're leaving after giving you everything in the world
Like a brand new Benz, a laced out crib
A pocket full of dough and your baby got milk
Girl, why you trippin', 'cause I stayed out late at night
But I locked my keys in my car
After getting off work, didn't think to call

If innocent is my plea (Girl, I'm innocent)
Then why can't you trust in me? (Ooh yeah)
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your question could be the end
Oh, I'm guilty for loving you (Oh yeah)
And that's all I've got to prove
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answers to your questions could be the end

So you think I've been cheating, yeah
Even though we've been through this type of shit before
But I told you then that I changed my ways
Baby believe me 'cause I'm not guilty
Don't let this tear us apart
'Cause I don't wanna lose your love
Girl, I promise you it won't happen again
You can trust in me, just don't let this end
Girl, I'm innocent

If innocent is my plea (Uh-huh)
Then why can't you trust in me? (Trust in me)
You don't wanna know where I've been (Oh yeah)
The answer to your question could be the end
Oh, I'm guilty for loving you (Oh yeah)
And that's all I've got to prove
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answers to your questions could be the end

I said I'm guilty for loving you
And that's all I've got to prove
Baby girl, I'm innocent
Guilty for trying to change
Baby, don't walk away
Girl, I'm innocent
Guilty for loving you
And that's all I've got to prove
Baby girl, I'm innocent
Guilty for trying to change
Baby don't walk away
Girl, I'm innocent

If innocent is my plea (Oh oh)
Then why can't you trust in me? (Oh yeah)
You don't wanna know where I've been (Where I've been)
The answer to your question could be the end
Oh, I'm guilty for loving you (Guilty for loving you)
And that's all I've got to prove
(That's all I got to prove)
You don't wanna know where I've been
(Said don't you walk out that door, I want you to stay)
The answers to your questions could be the end
(Don't promise forever, babe)
If innocent is my plea (Yeah)
Then why can't you trust in me? (Trust in me, trust in me)
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your question could be the end
I'm guilty for loving you (Guilty for loving you)
And that's all I've got to prove
(That's all I got to prove)
You don't wanna know where I've been
(Don't you walk out that door, girl, I want you to stay)
The answers to your questions could be the end
(Don't promise forever, babe)
If innocent is my plea
Then why can't you trust in me?
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your question could be the end
I'm guilty for loving you
