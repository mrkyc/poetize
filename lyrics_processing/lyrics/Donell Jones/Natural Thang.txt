It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right
It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right

You know that I want your love tonight
Cuz the feeling's oh so right
So take off your coat and settle down
Cause the time is now to move around
Every little fantasy
Girl, you got it with me
And if real love is what you want
Then you gotta come and get me on...

Every day, every night
I long to have near me all the time
Give me a chance to give you my love
Everything will be all right
But you gotta keep me satisfied

It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right
It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right

Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
Bumping' O'Jays as we get it on
Girl, you know, that I've been waiting patiently, patiently
I've been imagining thangs that we can do
You just gotta give me a chance
To make sweet love, make sweet love to you

Every day, every night
I long to have near me all the time
Give me a chance to give you my love
Everything will be all right
But you gotta keep me satisfied

It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right
It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right
Break it down

Oh baby, I've been waiting so long
Oh, I know, I know, I know
Give it to me
Yeah, right there
Everything's gonna be alright tonight
Oh yeah
It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
Come on and let's get to it tonight
The feeling's oh so right
It's not a natural thang if we can't do it
