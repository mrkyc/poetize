Ayo, D
Let's take it back
Let's take it back

Baby girl, I wanna make a toast to new beginnings
(You plus me) Equal loving combination
Them other dudes before me never knew what they were doin'
(Frontin' like they) They can't lose and, I'm just saying

They never stepped up
To give you the best of everything like you deserve, ooh girl
Their loss is my gain
They never felt your pain cause they don't know a woman's worth
Like I do

So many disappointments
You had before finding someone who
Knows how to treat you right
All those heartaches are over
Now that I'm here I'm gonna show you
The finer things in life
(Let's take it back)

Girl, I'm talking 'bout vacations on private islands
(Personal) Chefs provided...How you like that?
And your shopping game is gonna be on full display
On (Robertson) and Rodeo
Then we're to the crib for a nightcap

They never stepped up
To give you the best of everything like you deserve, ooh girl
Their loss is my gain
They never felt your pain 'cause they don't know a woman is worth
Ooh, like I do

So many disappointments
You had before finding someone who
Knows how to treat you right
All those heartaches are over
Now that I'm here I'm gonna show you
The finer things in life
(Let's take it back)

You know what, baby
They never stepped up
To go the extra mile to make you feel love and wanted
Like a woman must feel
Their loss is my gain
See, with D it ain't the same old same
I'm gonna show you the finer things, ooh, oh yeah
So many disappointments
You had before finding someone who
Knows how to treat you right
All those heartaches are over
(You ain't gotta worry no more, baby)
Now that I'm here I'm gonna show you
(I'm right here)
The finer things in life
(Let's take it back)
So many disappointments
You had before finding someone who
Knows how to treat you right
(The cryin' is over, baby)
All those heartaches are over
(It's a new beginning)
Now that I'm here I'm gonna show you
The finer things in life
(Let's take it back)
