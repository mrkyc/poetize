Yo, your boy's back, ha, Donell Jones
Tim and Bob
Yo, y'all know what to do

When I see you, I almost lost my mind
Sent two drinks your way to kick this thing off
Girl, I know, I got to get to you before it's too late
'Cause there's a lot of pimps up in this club
And I got to be the one

I'm telling you shorty I'm feeling you
Let them know that I'm feeling you
I'm so excited, I'm feeling you
Wanna get erotic, do you feel me?
So let's get naughty, I'm feeling you
Let them know that I'm feeling you
I'm so excited, I'm feeling you
Wanna get erotic, do you feel me?

Looking sexy with those Seven7 jeans on (Uh-huh)
Rocking stilletos with those manicured toes, they turn me on
Think I got you but I'm waiting for that sign
'Cause I got you smiling, girl, gotta get you out of here
You might also like
I can show you all the things you dreamed of, so come with me
And my gangster is so smooth, so what's the possibility?
You and me in a droptop 5 on the highway, we could speed
'Cause I'ma make you see what I see
Baby, roll with me

I'm telling you shorty I'm feeling you
Let them know that I'm feeling you
I'm so excited, I'm feeling you
Wanna get erotic, do you feel me?
So let's get naughty, I'm feeling you
Let them know that I'm feeling you
I'm so excited, I'm feeling you
Wanna get erotic, do you feel me?

'Cause I gotta get you, gotta get you up outta here to my crib
