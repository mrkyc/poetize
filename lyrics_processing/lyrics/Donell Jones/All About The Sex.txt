I got the top peeled back, switching lanes, doing 60 on the boulevard
In a rush to see tenderoni, down ass chick that'll do anything for me
Infatuated 'cause her heads on track
Conversation all that plus baby got back
Female version of a hustler (Diva)
If I was painting a picture she'd be my Mona (Lisa)
Heads roll when we do it real big
It's like a world premiere
The dark skin version of Brad & Angelina
But the opposite of Ike & Tina, (Get it), get it (Get it)
See, what we got is much more than physical
In the bed she can handle that business, though
If she was a penitentiary I'd be a lifer
Proud to wear that ball and chain and the stripes 'cause

It ain't all about the sex with her
I finally found a good woman that can rock with me
It ain't all about the sex with her
She got her own money, dollar signs don't mean a thing
It ain't all about the sex with her
But when she put it down, she put it down, just like I need and I like it
It ain't all about the sex with her
It ain't all about the sex, all about the sex, all about the sex with her, with her

Baby girl don't be trippin' when I wanna hang out with the fellas, yo
Never insecure, she don't bother
She let her better half do anything he wanna
If she sense something ain't right or if there's a sticky situation
She'll pull a brother to the side
Female version of a hustler (Diva)
If I was painting a picture she'd be my Mona (Lisa)
I get drunk off her lovin' 'cause it feel so right
(Drunk off of her love)
If she was a fifth of Hennessy I'd be an alcoholic
Ain't no rehab in the world that could make this brother quit
(Make this brother quit)
See what we got is much more than physical
In the bed she can handle that business, though
If she was a penitentiary I'd be a lifer
Proud to wear that ball and chain and the stripes but

It ain't all about the sex with her
I finally found a good woman that can rock with me
It ain't all about the sex with her
She got her own money, dollar signs don't mean a thing
It ain't all about the sex with her
But when she put it down, she put it down most definitely
It ain't all about the sex with her
It ain't all about the sex, all about the sex, all about the sex with her, with her
She's the kind of woman that a brother wanna give his all too
(Wanna give his all to)
The kind you want to keep around (The kind you wanna keep around)
Ain't gotta worry about her running out cheating cause she loves ya
(She won't cheat 'cause she loves ya)
You might meet a lot of women but this one will hold you down
It ain't all about the sex, oh
See, baby girl got conversation, romance when I want it
She's all I need, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ha, you know where to find a woman like that, you got to keep her
D. Jones, baby

It ain't all about the sex with her
I found somebody that can rock with me, rock with me
It ain't all about the sex with her
I'ma grip her to the left, she gon' come back to the right
It ain't all about the sex with her
I found somebody that can rock with me, rock with me
It ain't all about the sex with her
It ain't all about the sex with her
It ain't all about the sex with her
