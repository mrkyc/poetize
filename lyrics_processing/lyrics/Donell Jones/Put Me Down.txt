If I lace you, would you lace me back?
If I blaze you, would you blaze me back?
Spendin' big faces on the things you like
When ya gonna put me down?
If I ride for you, die for you
If I floss at any cost for you
Shorty, all I wanna know from you
Is when ya gonna put me down?

First time I saw you, I was breathless
Lookin' flawless, fifty on the necklace
And I had to add you to my guest list
Let you pass, I had to put it down
We sipped and kicked a little convo
It's time to head back to the condo
And I know what we both came here for
Let me know what you're feelin' now

Do you want to open up and show me your love
Stop playing around and puttin' me down
Stop holdin' back, you gotta react
When ya gonna hold me down?
You're perkin', plus we're workin'
All this flirtin' got me hurting
When you know I don't deserve this girl
Why ya gonna hold me down?

Shorty I'm not tryin' to put a rush on you
Can't keep leavin' me with my love on blue
Nobody's here, we better make our move
I want to get into you (I want to get into you)
You won't have to floss, I wanna cop that
Frontin' on my love, now, shorty, stop that
What's it gonna be?
When are we gonna put it down?
I need to know right now

Do you want to open up and show me your love
Stop playing around and puttin' me down
Stop holdin' back, you gotta react

On the top floor in the president's suite
Hit the tinted windows in the back of my Jeep
Or your friend's house on the livin' room couch
If you let me hit it, I'ma blaze it out
Won't cha open up, let me come on in
And I'll never stop, we can do it again
'Cause you take it right where I wanna be
You got me in ecstasy

I wanna know
I gotta know when you're gonna let me see it
When you gon' let me hit it?
'Girl, you know I'm gonna get it
