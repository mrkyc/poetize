Gotta break it on down
Gotta break it on down
Break it on down
I'm gonna be right there for you
Whenever you need me my boo
Verse 1:
Never thought I'd know such pleasure
Never thought I'd come to feel
Tenderness of your touch
The good taste of your sweet love
The sexiness of your appeal
When you smiled I saw angels
And all my worries disappeared
You looked at me with your heart
Blessed me with your wonder
And heard my future in your ear
Chorus:
So wherever you run
That's where I'll go
However you glide
That's how I'll go
Whenever you shine
That's when I'll go
It don't matter the time
Baby I'll go
