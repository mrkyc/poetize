This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day
This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

As I step on the scene, yo I'm steady maxin'
And I call up my boys 'cause I'm looking for some action
We need to kick it like we use to
Back in the days when we were known as the crazy crew
It's good to reminisce on the old days
When we use to kick it with the G's and the homeys
I would go back, yo if I could
This is for my peoples that still roll around in the hood

This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day
This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

Heads up on that ride she's a hottie
All the fellas break wide to summer bunnies
That's the way that we flex, yeah
Everyday on the O.G set, but keep it smooth
I keep it smooth on a move spit to the hotties
On a late night move to flex their bodies
That's the way that we hang
On a regular doing our own thang

This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day
This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

This is for the playas in the hood, up to no good
And we're rolling around, and we're doing our thang
This is for the playas in the hood, up to no good
And we're rolling around, and we're doing our thang
