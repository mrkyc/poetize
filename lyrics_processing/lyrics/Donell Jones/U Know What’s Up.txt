Said I'm diggin' you and I'm wantin' you
So tell me, what's up? (So tell me, what's up, baby?)

Peep her thighs and I'm zonin' right around two in the mornin'
Lookin' fly with the sun dress on, I think I feel a bone comin' on
Girl, you got me wide open, waitin' all day and I'm hopin'
So, baby, don't front, backseat Jeep, you know what I want
