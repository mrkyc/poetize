Someone who can satisfy my every little need
I'm hoping it's you
I've been waiting for someone to bring their love to me
I'm hoping it's you

I wonder if you're qualified to give me love and affection
'Cause in my mind, girl, I'm hoping that it's you
'Cause things never seem to go my way
I've been hurt so many times before
And I need a little something more
Are you that someone?

You got a opportunity if you wanna be my lady
I want you to know that people say I'm hard to please
So won't you come and change my world?
I can give you anything you need
But I wanna know what can you do for me
What can you do do for me, baby?
You might also like
