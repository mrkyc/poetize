Ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-oh, yeah
Listen, baby

Up in the place I see you gettin' down
Can't help but look at ya
Gotta crowd around ya
Now, you're the baddest thing I've seen tonight
So come on, girl, let's put it in flight
I got the V-1-2, 6-0-0
Sittin' outside of the door, so bring it on
By the way your body's blazeful
And that's a little something that a nigga craves for, yeah

It's a quarter past three, girl, what's it gon' be?
Shorty got her eyes on me
We been talkin' since two, girl, whatcha gon' do?
Tell 'em that you're ridin' with me
It's a quarter past three, girl, what's it gon' be?
Shorty got her eyes on me
You've been frontin' since two, girl, what you gon' do?
I'll be chillin' at the Embassy, what?
You might also like
While watching you move I start to fantasize
About the way I'm gonna put it on that ass tonight
So come on and ride shotgun
I got the bubbles, if you like it, we can pop some
I see me and you, flossin' in my coupe
Maybe we can peel back the roof and get it on
Did I say your body's blazeful?
I like that little thing around your navel, baby

It's a quarter past three, girl, what's it gon' be?
Shorty got her eyes on me
We been talkin' since two, girl, whatcha gon' do?
Tell 'em that you're ridin' with me
It's a quarter past three, girl, what's it gon' be?
Shorty got her eyes on me
You've been frontin' since two, girl, what you gon' do?

All I know is I'm not leaving here alone, yeah
Now you might the baddest in the club to me
But shorty's got it bad and wanna fly wit' me tonight
So what you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
Is it gonna be me and you?
You gotta stop playing games
Girl, you gotta stop fakin' moves
It's a quarter past three, girl, what's it gon' be?
Shorty got her eyes on me
