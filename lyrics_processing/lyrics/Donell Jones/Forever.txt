Yeah, this goes out to all the woman that hold they man down
Especially my woman, my 22

Baby, since that day we met I-I (Feel so complete)
We've wrapped your love around that, babe
I don't have to want for nothin'
As long as I can be with you
I wanna be with you
Baby, you're my inspiration (Angel with wings)
You put your life on hold to be with me

I can't live a day without you
You've been so good to me, I wanna prove it to you
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But I'm cryin' out to you
'Cause I see me with you ('Cause I see me with you) for the rest of my life, yeah
Girl, there's nothin' I would rather do than to be here forever, baby
Ooh
Everyday I wanna be your tomorrow
I'm gon' be here forever, baby, ooh yeah
Lead you to a life of love if you follow me
To forever with me, babe
Ohh, yeah
When there's no more time left to borrow
I'm gon' be here forever, baby
Ooh, yeah
'Cause I got a ring for your finger, please don't say no
Forever
(Forever, forever, forever, forever, oh, ohh)
Yeah, wanna give you forever (Forever, forever, ever, forever, oh, ohh)
Oh, ohh
Baby, I'm askin' you to spend forever with me
All you got to do is say yes
You might also like
I love the way you elevate me (To the highest peak)
And you'll never steer me wrong
Even when I pulled away you (Brought my focus back to you)
I'm so thankful
Baby, you have held me down for (So many years)
Ooh, good times, I weigh the tears

I can't live a day without you
You've been so good to me, I wanna prove it to you
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But I'm cryin' out to you
'Cause I see me with you ('Cause I see me with you) for the rest of my life, yeah
Girl, there's nothin' I would rather do than to be here forever, baby
Ooh
Everyday I wanna be your tomorrow
I'm gon' be here forever, baby, ooh yeah
Lead you to a life of love if you follow me
To forever with me, babe
Ohh, yeah
When there's no more time left to borrow
I'm gon' be here forever, baby
Ooh, yeah
'Cause I got a ring for your finger, please don't say no
Forever
