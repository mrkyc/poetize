You alright baby?
Don't worry about him
It's gonna be alright

He don't treat you like he used to
Cause he got somebody else
Girl I fear for you cause you're all by yourself
Don't you shed a tear be strong
And don't let this nightmare get to you
Cause some men gotta have two girls and that ain't cool

He won't hurt you again
He's never gonna hurt you again
Girl, you've got a friend in me
He's won't hurt you again
He's never gonna hurt you again
All you've gotta do is believe in me

Lock the doors, I'm on my way
Cause he has no right to put his hands on you
Girl it hurts me to see him play you for a fool
So pack your bags, come go with me
I'll be that sunshine in your life
There's no need to worry it's gonna be alright
Cause he won't hurt you
