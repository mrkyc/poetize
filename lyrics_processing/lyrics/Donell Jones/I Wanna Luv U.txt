I wanna love you
Every night, every day
You know I need you
In my life, won't you stay
I wanna love you
Every night, every day
You know I need you

You are the reason why I live, mmm
A newfound joy I can't contain, yeah
Found myself thinking about your love, mmm
It's a feeling I get, only my heart can explain
You know I

I wanna love you
Every night, every day
You know I need you

I've never felt so deep in love
I think it's because you've touched a special part of me, baby
Hope I'm the one you're thinking of
You must be feeling the same as I do
Can't see being in love without you, baby baby

Girl, I think about you every day
Hoping you will never go away
It's so special when we all can share
Someone who gives us tender loving care
Girl, I think about you every night
Sharing dinner and a candlelight
Saying 'I love you' and hoping we
We'll be together for eternity

Gonna say it one more time
Said I'm lovin' you, lovin' you, baby
