I want you to know you're the best thing that came into my life
You make me feel so right, you've opened my eyes
A new world for me to see what we could be
I don't wanna be lonely, baby you know, yeah (You've got to know, yeah)

I would give anything just to be with you
Sacrificed my life to make your dreams come true
You gave my heart a brand new start, we'll never part
I wanna be where you are

I want you to know that I can give you love
I want you to know that I am promising you the world
I want you to know that I love you so
No one can take your love away from me

I want you to see I can be all the man you'll ever need
I think of you only, your future with me
It's a love that grows too far beyond a dream
I don't wanna be lonely, baby you know, yeah

I would give anything just to be with you
Sacrificed my life to make your dreams come true
You gave my heart a brand new start, we'll never part
I wanna be where you are
