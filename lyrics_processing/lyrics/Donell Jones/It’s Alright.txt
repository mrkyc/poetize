Let the telephone ring
It's about to get physical
It's just you and me on a late night creep
Plan on making you moan
But first let's get the mood right
I got the '76 Dom Perignon
And a dime bag of smoke so let's get it on
Come on

(It's okay) It's okay, (It's alright) It's alright
(We're gonna do it tonight)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(It's okay) It's okay, (It's alright) It's alright
(We're gonna do it tonight)

Get the bath water ready
It's about to get kinky
I imagine that body so soft
I won't know 'til you take your clothes off, woo
Don't you be afraid
I wanna be you sex slave
Give you some lovin', kissin', and huggin'
You won't ask for nothin'
Oh, no no no
You might also like
(It's okay) And it's okay, (It's alright) And it's alright
(We're gonna do it tonight)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, oh no
(It's okay) And it's okay, (It's alright) And it's alright
(We're gonna do it tonight)
Take it to the bridge, go and take it to the bridge
Come on

Whatever we do ain't leavin' here
I got a million ways to love you
I'll be gentle so there's no need to fear
So come over here (Come over here, baby)
I've been waiting for this for so long
Seems like I can't hold back this feeling
I'm on a mission to make you moan
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)

(It's okay, it's alright) It's alright
(We're gonna do it tonight)
You don't have to worry, oh no
(It's okay) It's okay, (It's alright) It's alright
(We're gonna do it tonight)
Yeah
I wanna make you moan
It's alright
Whatever we do ain't leavin' here
You don't have to be afraid, baby, no
Said it's alright

(It's okay) And it's okay, (It's alright) It's alright
(We're gonna do it tonight)
It's just me and you
(It's okay) Bath water's ready (It's alright)
Gonna have you up all night
(We're gonna do it tonight) It's alright
(It's okay, it's alright)
(We're gonna do it tonight)
(It's okay, it's alright)
