I'm sorry that I hurt you
Please say it ain't over
All I wanna know is:
When are you coming home?
I've been sitting on the sofa
Waiting for your call
'Cause every time I call you
I get no answer

Baby, you're living in a fantasy
You won't let it go
And I can't let go
Can't you see I need you desperately?
Say it ain't so
'Cause I can't let go
Baby, I'm sorry I hurt you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
I'm sorry just wasn't enough
Sorry that I hurt you
'Cause you used to be my love
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I'm sorry just wasn't enough
I'm sorry that I hurt you
'Cause you used to be my love
My love, 'cause you used to be my love
My love
You used to be my love
Ooh girl, I'm sorry
I'm sorry that I hurt you, please come back
You might also like
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't want another lover
It won't happen again
I'm tired of breaking your heart
I was hoping maybe we could make up and restart
But every time I call you
I get no answer

Baby, you're living in a fantasy
You won't let it go
And I can't let go
(Can you please pick up the phone?)
Can't you see I need you desperately?
Say it ain't so
'Cause I can't let go
I'm so sorry that I just can't let you go

I'm sorry that I hurt you
I'm sorry just wasn't enough
Sorry that I hurt you
'Cause you used to be my love
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I'm sorry just wasn't enough
I'm sorry that I hurt you
'Cause you used to be my love
And I'm praying you could forgive me
'Cause you used to be my love
You used to be, be my
My love, my love
Listen
You used to wake up in the morning
With you there next to me
You used to be, you used to be
And I'm sad you're not here me
'Cause I need you so desperately
Hey, you used to be
I'm sorry that I hurt you
Sorry just wasn't enough
Wasn't enough, wasn't enough, wasn't enough
Sorry that I hurt you
Just wasn't enough
