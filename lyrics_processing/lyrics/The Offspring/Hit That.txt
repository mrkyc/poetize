The winds of fortune don't blow the same
She had to get out and make a change
She had a kid now, but much too young
That baby daddy's out having fun

He's sayin', "I'm on a roll with all the girls I know"
His baby momma, she ain't so slow
He's sayin', "I'm on a roll with all the girls I know"
I know you wanna hit that, I know you wanna hit that, hit that

All the world is gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way it
That's the way things go, ay, ay, ay

What was a family, is now a shell
We're raising kids now who raise themselves
Sex is a weapon, it's like a drug
It gets him right into that grave that he just dug

She's saying, "I'm on the run, I'm chasing guys for fun"
Her baby daddy, it ain't his only one
She's sayin', "I'm on the run, I'm chasing guys for fun"
I know you wanna hit that, I know you wanna hit that, hit that

Everybody's gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way it
That's the way things go, ay, ay, ay

Well it winds up, broken up, really such a shame
But why not take a chance, everything's a game
And it don't stop hooking up, nothing's gonna change
Well, the more he's trying, the more he's buying

He says, "I'm on a roll with all the girls I know"
His baby momma don't need to know
He's sayin', "I'm on a roll with all the girls I know"
I know you wanna hit that, I know you wanna hit that, hit that

All the world is gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way it
