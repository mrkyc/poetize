Withering eyes catch you as you fall
A bitter sigh, no one moves at all
Let me in for one more long disgrace
Just forget the same distractions you refuse to face

We both know that it's gone...
But what if no one knows
No one knows
To remember why it's wrong?

This is all the pain a man can take
This is how a broken heart still breaks

I don't need much to show you
Only enough to control you
Bury your head inside this
And gather the darkness that binds it
I think I'll die if you deny me
Swallowed alive in eternity
Give me a way to be the agony
That knew you all along...
You might also like
Push it down and hide me from this waste
Don't hold back; I'd kill to take your place
Tell me a lie... Tell me you don't care
Just forget a storm is coming, just forget you're scared

We both know how this ends...
But what if no one knows
No one knows
How to kill us in the end?

This is all you need for who you are
This is how a good man goes too far

I don't need much to show you
Only enough to control you
Bury your head inside this
And gather the darkness that binds it
I think I'll die if you deny me
Swallowed alive in eternity
Give me a way to be the agony
That knew you all along...
This is all the pain a man can take
This is how the blackest heart can break

I don't need much to show you
Only enough to control you
Bury your head inside this
And gather the darkness that binds it
I think I'll die if you deny me
Swallowed alive in eternity
Give me a way to be the agony
That knew you all along...

I've known you all along
