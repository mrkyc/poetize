If you take a step towards me
You will take my breath away
So, I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
No one else has ever loved me
No one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take

Then I saw the worst was over
When I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place
Out of all the past illusions
Out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face

And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too
You might also like
Let me take a step towards you
Let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads
There's a darkness down inside me
That I know we'll both enjoy
And it's screaming from within to set it free

I have left this bloody nightmare
In my wake but out of sight
All I want is deviation by design
Out of all the past confusion
Out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours, 'cause you are mine

And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too
It doesn't really matter what you do or say
I'm never goin' anywhere anyway
'Cause when I'm dyin' for you
I've never felt so alive

And if you cried out for more...
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you? 'Cause I know you saved me, too

I know you saved me, too
