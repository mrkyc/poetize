I am an anti-everything man
A scab on the lips of the Lord
And my caustic dismissal
Is all I need to get you to fall on your sword
It's easy to live fast; it's harder to live
I woke up today with a gun
Ignoring your history is killing your past
You might run forever if death never lasts

So do me a favor; your behavior
Is just a reason why there is no savior
When you're wasted, let's face it
There's a side of you that knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy, but looks like a stranger

The bell has rung on the titans (Ha-ha-ha)
Everybody, give us some room
Your so-called set of fake morals
I can't tell the difference; is that an excuse?
The matter at hand is a matter of time
A sad, little kid with broken toys
Your dogmatic license has kept you inside
What will you do when you're burning alive?
You might also like
Do me a favor; your behavior
Is just a reason why there is no savior
When you're wasted, let's face it
There's a side of you that knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy, but looks like a stranger


So do me a favor; your behavior
Is just a reason why there is no savior
When you're wasted, let's face it
There's a side of you that knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy, but looks like a stranger

I don't mind my old, dead story
And I don't want to lie to you
I know my glory
Will never be the same as truth...
By now, my only enemy is you
I won't go slowly; I'll leave you behind
Leave you behind, leave you behind
