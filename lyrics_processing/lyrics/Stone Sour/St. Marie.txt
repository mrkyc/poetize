Oh, July is better off since April died
I can see September through the trees
And I can't lie, there's more to know than what's inside
Maybe there's some reason in my memories
But all I know, it's easier to love you when I'm gone
But it's hard for me to leave
I don't know, this anger isn't helping anyone
And I don't know what I need

Oh, St. Marie, close my eyes before you leave
So I don't have to look at you in shame
Oh, St. Marie, take my hand and give me peace
'Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same

Here come the broken hearts, just as the music starts
One by one, they testify
I never did enough, I never cared enough
Even though I stood, I always ran away
We all wonder why it's easier to blame the ones you love
'Cause it's harder to believe that we fall sometimes
No matter how I try, I've given up
But now I have a chance to be
You might also like
Oh, St. Marie, close my eyes before you leave
So I don't have to look at you in shame
Oh, St. Marie, take my hand and give me peace
'Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same

Sometimes, the quiet ones are all I want to be
There's only so much left, the rest is up to me
You're all I'll ever want, I hope you feel it, 'cause
As far as I'm concerned, you're exactly what I need

Oh, St. Marie, close my eyes before you leave
So I don't have to look at you in shame
Oh, St. Marie, take my hand and give me peace
'Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same
'Cause I don't think I'll ever be the same
