These visions in your vapor
Make you more and less
Keeping chaos is a chore today
But that murder in your sorrow
Bellows smoke and death
I wonder what the neighbors, shhh...
Will think of to say

Thunderstorms banging on my windows
Chloroform sticking to my face and then
Careful now, a symbol is a promise
Going down, going down in flames
Before the crash, we get you home
It's nothing serious
It's just the space between
The sword and stone

Only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know (Know)
We know the riddle, but the answer is mine
'Cause only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know (Know)
We know the future is another Friday Knight
You might also like
Exquisite in absentia and divine inside
Can your differences come out to play?
And when did all your heroes take the goddamn blame?
When did all the villains... catch all the breaks?

Thunderstorms banging on my windows
Chloroform sticking to my face and then
Careful now, a symbol is a promise
Going down, going down in flames again

Only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know (Know)
We know the riddle, but the answer is mine
'Cause only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know (Know)
We know the future is another Friday Knight

Yeah!
Soft quotation never sounds as real
Confrontation always makes you feel
Before the crash, we get you home
It's nothing serious
It's just the space between
The sword and stone
Oh, only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know (Know)
We know the riddle, but the answer is mine
'Cause only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know (Know)
