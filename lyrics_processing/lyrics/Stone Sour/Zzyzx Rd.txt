I don't know how else to put this
It's taken me so long to do this
I'm falling asleep and I can't see straight
My muscles feel like a melee
My body's curled in a "U" shape
I put on my best, but I'm still afraid

Propped up by lies with promises
Saving my place as life forgets
Maybe it's time I saw the world
I'm only here for a while
But patience is not my style
And I'm so tired that I gotta go

What am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
Did you really think I wouldn't see this through?
Tell me I should stick around for you
Tell me I could have it all
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go

I get to go home in one week
But I'm leaving home in three weeks
They throw me a bone just to pick me dry
I'm following suit and directions
I crawl up inside for protection
I'm told what to do and I don't know why
You might also like
I'm over existing in limbo
I'm over the myths and placebos
I don't really mind if I just fade away
I'm ready to live with my family
I'm ready to die in obscurity
'Cause I'm so tired that I got to go

Oh, where am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
You still don't think I'm gonna see this through?
Tell me I'm a part of history
Tell me I could have it all
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go
Yeah, no
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go
Yeah, yeah
I'm still too tired to care and I gotta go
Yeah, no, no
