Seed, gotta let it grow
Why ya gotta watch when I let it feed?
Better look into the mirror
For the face you hide away, every day
But I don't give a fuck
I let it roll, I smoke the old
Gotta run, gotta rend, gotta maim
Gotta make it through another maze, stay away!

Please... wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, get inside!

Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
Get inside, get inside

Christ, have you seen this guy?
Make ya sick, gonna peel away all the impurities
'Cause all you wanna do is keep curin' me
But I don't give a fuck; I kill everyone
You'll be mopping up blood and guts
And all the shit when I'm done
Isn't this fun? Give me a gun
And I'll tell you all the secrets I hide before I run!

Please... wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, get inside!

Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
Get inside, get inside

Maybe if you look away, I can slip away
Gotta get away (Run, motherfucker)
Right now, I stare at shit; I'm a heretic
But I'll never give you none of it
Tied up in the back of the lab, laid on the slab
Got the gift of gab, whatcha want from me?
I don't even know I got a damn disease
But I know you wanna kill me!

Please wring the blood from my hands
Don't pretend that you understand me
I don't even want you looking at me
Motherfucker, get inside!
Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
Get inside, get inside
Motherfucker
