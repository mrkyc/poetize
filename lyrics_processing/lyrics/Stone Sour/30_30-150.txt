(I am a) Dominant gene, live as I die
Never say forever 'cause forever's a lie
I can see right through you, so I can ignore you
The story changes, but the ending won't bore you
I tried to tell you, but you simply obeyed
They didn't listen, so they threw you away
Now all you do is talk; I don't wanna hear your bullshit...
Is this what you want?

This is where it begins
This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see, we're all clearly alive
We know where you are, and we're coming
Let's see ya say that shit to our face
30/30-150 remembers
30/30-150 hates
You might also like
In my own peculiar way, I feel mercurial
Before I get ahead of myself again
I know the where, but I still don't know the when
You want to live in a one-sided world
Be prepared for a whole world of hurt
Now it's the grand facade
I don't wanna be an angel...
I just wanna be God!

They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see, we're all clearly alive
We know where you are, and we're coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face
30/30-150 remembers
30/30-150 hates
Hates

(I am a) Fuckin' machine fueled by the past
A memory's a memory until it's a fact
I can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
But I got too many grudges to hold
Saw a lot of people die in the end
I never wanna walk that road again
Now I will never give up
I don't wanna have it all...
I just wanna have enough
This is where it begins
This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see, we're all clearly alive
We know where you are, and we're coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face
