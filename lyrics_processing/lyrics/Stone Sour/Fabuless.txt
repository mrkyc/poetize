Oh, yeah

I can't recall the last time
I was caught between the walls
Those razors in the pillowcases
Seem to cut 'em all, but...
Old foes, dead things, take a toll...
Remember, it's just a game

Been a long time since I rock-and-rolled
It's only rock-and-roll but I like it, like it
Don't talk, walk; don't feel real
Don't stay, say; you'll need it anyway

Oh, it's my own damn fault
I guess it's good to be the enemy
That don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
Because it's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here, motherfucker
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill
You can't get home from here
You might also like
Your beast is just a burden
That you never keep in line
This "fabuless" is really less
Hmm, gets 'em every time
You roll your eyes for money
Don't act like you're impressed
You spread your legs for TV time
Baby... who fucks you best?

It's all downhill
You can't get home from here
Oh, it's my own damn fault
I guess it's good to be the enemy
That don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
Oh, and maybe when you fall
You'll make peace with your gravity
We all know it drives you mad, mad, mad
Because it's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here, motherfucker
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here, motherfucker

You can't get home from here
You can't get home from here, motherfucker
You can't get home from here
