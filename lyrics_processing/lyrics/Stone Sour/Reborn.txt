I am walking through your streets
I am looking in your windows
I am elemental now
You'll never even know I'm there
I am watching over you
I am living in the shadows
I am just a word to you
But I am very real and cold...

Cold to all of this
Cold to how you feel
Cold to all your lucid reason

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am every day
I am gonna be...

I am all there is to know
I am all that you've forgotten
I am enigmatic now
You never even knew my name
I am dressed in tragedy
I am by design immortal
I am just the last one left
But I am always here and old
You might also like
Old and very strong
Old as all you feel
Old as all the world around you

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am every day
I am gonna be...

Reborn (This is the start of something)
Reborn (This is the start of something)
Reborn (This is the start of something)
Reborn (This is the start of something)

I am just a secret now
I am just a vague illusion
I'm a lie you tell yourself
That you never truly did believe
I'm a whisper in the dark
I'm a victim and the killer
I am almost ready now
But you insist I don't exist
That I don't exist
That I don't exist
That I don't
Exist
I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am every day
I am gonna be...

Reborn (This is the start of something)
Reborn (This is the start of something)
Reborn (This is the start of something)
Reborn (This is the start of something)
