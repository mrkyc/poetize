This record is an unseen enemy of the human mind
(You are going to relax)
Use it regularly
Bring your mind to follow the suggestions
To an unpleasant degree
(You are going to relax)
The mind needs nervous tension
And now we shall begin
(Listen only to my voice)
One word of caution:
"RU486"

The pity turns complacent
The bitter comes in a rush
Nobody needs a hopeless romantic
Who never sleeps and drinks too much
The fear is unrepentant
That means there's nowhere to hide
So draw a breath, and kill my Judas
You'll never know until you come inside

You are defeatist... forsaken...
A jewel in the crown of the sun
Never repeated... or taken...
I wouldn't change a fucking thing that you've done
You might also like
Going down alive, going down alive
Assume your nemesis
Going down alive, going down alive
RU486

Another weak contender
Another pound of the nails
The future lies in perfect condition
You can do it if you're built to fail
I only know solutions
I've never thought of the end
Someone else is closing the casket
Another hungry mouth to defend

You are defeated... forbidden...
A name at the top of the list
Never related... or stricken...
I wouldn't change a fucking thing about this

Going down alive, going down alive
Assume your nemesis
Going down alive, going down alive
RU486?
(You) Protector (Won't) Suspector (Feel)
The victor is only who is left insane
(You) Detractor (Don't) Subtractor (See)
The answer is screaming what you'll never say


We are demeaning... forever...
A world that will never exist
Always repeating... or severed...
We wouldn't change a fucking thing about this

Going down alive, going down alive
Assume your nemesis
Going down alive, going down alive
Are you 486?
Going down alive, going down alive
Assume your nemesis
Going down alive, going down alive
