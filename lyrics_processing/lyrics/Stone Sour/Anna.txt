Tell me again why you're running away
Do you need me? (Do you need me?)
Nobody's home and there's nowhere to stay
Do you believe me? (Do you believe me?)
Maybe I can't be the man of your dreams
But I could save you (I could save you)
You were never really gone and it seems
That you can feel it, too (Feel it, too)

We won't see the stars if the sun is in our eyes
So don't look so surprised

Because it's just another reason why a fool like you
Would listen to a fool like me
I'll do what all the idiots around you do
And show you that you'll never be free
You're not supposed to feel this right
One is always better if you can't have two
Now that I have nothing, well, I can't have you
You left me once, don't you leave me twice
'Cause no one is alone, no one is alone
(No one is really alone)
You might also like
Tell me again how I'm on your mind
You're always on mine
Tell me it's really just a matter of time
And I'll believe a lie

I can't see the sun because your stars are in my eyes
So don't look so surprised

Because it's just another reason why a fool like you
Would listen to a fool like me
I'll do what all the idiots around you do
And show you that you'll never be free
You're not supposed to feel this right
One is always better if you can't have two
Now that I have nothing, well, I can't have you
You left me once, don't you leave me twice
'Cause no one is alone, no one is alone
(Alone)

Oh, what am I gonna do? You feel so right
Nothing is forever if it can't be true
Now that I am nothing, I have to have you
You loved me once, you better love me twice
'Cause no one is alone, no one is alone
(No one is really alone)
Tell me again why you're running away
Do you need me? (Do you need me?)
