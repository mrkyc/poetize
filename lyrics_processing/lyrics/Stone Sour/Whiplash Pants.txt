Looking around, I can see what's going on
By the way, it didn't take too long
What ya do while I was on the line?
Spend your free time wasting mine
Living in the chaos, sleeping in the shit
Evidence proves that you don't really get it
When you're finished just taking up space
Wipe that face off your goddamn face and

Smile
Everybody seems to think
It's too soon to think, but
Smile
Someday, you'll have to stand
On your own two feet, so

Sometimes, you think you know it all...
Until you find you never knew a thing (Never knew a thing)
You never knew a thing (Never knew a thing)
Just when you think you have it all...
Then you find you never had a thing (Never had a thing)
You see the door, but you leave with nothing
You might also like
You could be the one on duty
Time to wake up, Sleeping Beauty
Fucking around all day
The house gives and it taketh away
Walking in the pigsty, running on the coals
You're gonna love it when your luck unfolds
Nobody there to provide you, ride you
Clean you up and gently remind you!

Smile
Everybody does everything
And anything for you
Smile
You better be prepared
When we start to ignore you

Sometimes, you think you know it all...
Until you find you never knew a thing (Never knew a thing)
You never knew a thing (Never knew a thing)
Just when you think you have it all...
Then you find you never had a thing (Never had a thing)
You see the door, but you leave with nothing
Come get your shit!
Come get your shit!
Come and get your shit!
Come, get your shit!

Have I ever told ya anything
That never came true, motherfucker?
Yeah, I'm talking to you
You think you're getting through and making a dent
But same shit, different damn event
Go ahead, keep it up, see if I care
What do I know? I've only already been there
Do what you want, but you better be fast
Hard to see the world with your head up your ass, so...

Smile
Everybody's gonna know
That you're in over your head
Smile
'Cause you never fucking listen
To a word we've said

Sometimes, you think you know it all...
Until you find you never knew a thing (Never knew a thing)
You never knew a thing (Never knew a thing)
Just when you think you have it all...
Then you find you never had a thing (Never had a thing)
You never had a thing (Never had a thing)
Sometimes, you think you know it all (Sometimes, you think you know it all)
Until you find you never knew a thing (Never knew a thing)
You never knew a thing (Never knew a thing)
Just when you think you have it all (Just when you think you have it all)
Then you find you never had a thing (Never had a thing)
Before you fucking leave

Come get your shit!
Come get your shit!
Come and get your shit!
Come get your shit!
