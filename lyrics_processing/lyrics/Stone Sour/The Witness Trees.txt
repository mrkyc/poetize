I don't know what I need
I'm scared of life, I'm scared of what it means to me
This broken home is just not what it used to be
Too fast to slow me down...
Too loud to drown me out
I doubt I'll ever get this close to what I was
Because I've seen the grand design
Hold on, I hope you'll talk about the future when I'm gone
But if I'm wrong, I'll know the reason why

I, I can't feel anything
I can't feel anything that's under my control
I, I won't do anything
I won't do anything that's out of my control

I can see myself
Extended past the limits of my cry for help
I don't believe I've ever come this way before
So why do I know my way?
What do I have to say and do
To drain that look of shame away from you?
I knew we'd never find our peace
Hold on, I hope you'll celebrate the past before I'm gone
But if I'm wrong, I'll know that it was me
You might also like
I, I can't feel anything
I can't feel anything that's under my control
I, I won't do anything
I won't do anything that's out of my, out of my control

I don't know what you need
I'm scared of love, I'm scared of what it means to me
This empty house is burning down around me
So cold, I don't know how...
So much for holding out
I hope I suffocate before I let you choke
On words you know I'll never say
Oh, no, don't go
I want you to destroy me one more time
So when I die... I'll know you really loved me

I, I can't feel anything
I can't feel anything that's under my control
I, I won't do anything
I won't do anything that's out of my, out of my control
