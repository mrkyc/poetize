RU486! RU486! RU486! RU486! RU486!

Oh, this is what it's coming to: another Waterloo
You wanna put me underground 'cause I'm overused
Giving up as you're pulling me down
I will make you come unglued
You can cover me in subtleties, what an effigy
I can fake it, 'cause you'll never be real to me
I'm innocent; I know I'm near the end
But if I can't understand, I will never win

The more I know my mind
The more I leave you all behind
Living in the shadow of doubt
I'll never obey, but I'll always decide

All my hopes survive
I've got to do it alone
I will burn alive
In the House of Gold and Bones

Oh, you're the epitome of all the shit in me
And I'm surrounded by the people I will never be
Either way, I've got nothing to prove
To a son of a bitch like you
Well, this is hell, and I wanted it, but I'm an idiot
It's a phase, 'cause I know I'm illegitimate
You might also like
Kill it, I want to see it
I want to feel it; I won't be here forever

The more I know my mind
The more I leave you all behind
Living in the shadow of doubt
I'll never obey, and I'll always decide

All my hopes survive
I've got to do it alone
I will burn alive
In the House of Gold and Bones


The more I know my mind
The more I leave this world behind
Living in the shadow of doubt
I'm already gone, I'm already alive

All my hopes survive
I've got to do it alone
I will burn alive
In the House of Gold and Bones
All my hopes survive
I've got to do it alone
I will burn alive
In the House of Gold and Bones
In the House of Gold and Bones
