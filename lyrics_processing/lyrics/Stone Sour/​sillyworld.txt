Freedom's just a word today
Freedom's just a word
When someone takes your word away
It's seldom ever heard
So, take a sentence full of things
You're not supposed to say
Carry on... but don't write it down
Or you'll be gone

Love is just a song today
Love is just a song
When someone takes the song away
You seldom sing along
So, take those lyrics serious
And sing your life away
Carry on... but don't write 'em down
Or they'll be gone

All we ever do is talk
We like to ride, but we never walk
We make it so damn easy
We get bored
Why can't anybody see
What's good for you is good for me?
I can't take your silly world
I can't take your silly world no more
You might also like
Peace is just two fingers now
Peace was just a phase
When someone put it on a shirt
You knew to count the days
So, take those fingers, tape 'em up
And shove 'em up your ass
And carry on... but don't try it now
'Cause peace is gone

All we ever do is talk
We like to ride but we never walk
We make it so damn easy
We get bored
Why can't anybody see
What's good for you is bad for me?
I can't take your silly world
I can't take your silly world no more

We fight our instincts
We go to extremes
We fight our instincts
We go to extremes
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
We fight our lives...
