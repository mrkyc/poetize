You play with my emotions when you feel it's right
I play with my pinky ring when I need to
I try to just, I try to get my focus right
I play the victim, but you can see through
So I get angry and start to break things
I'll fuck up everything that you need, boo
She asked me, "why do you always change face?"
One minute you homeless and then you regal (yeah)

You think you know it all
You little girl, you're so thoughtless
Running around and you talk shit
I ain't never know what you're thinking
And you don't know what you started
You always seem on a mission
Oh, I don't know what to call it
You think you know it all
You little girl, you're so thoughtless
Running around and you talk shit
I ain't never know what you're thinking
And you don't know what you started
You always seem on a mission
Oh, I don't know what to call it

I got so tired I took a long dream
Hopped in the hooptie to come and see you
Stopped on the way forcing myself to think
Smart Aleck Kill in my way to freedom
And now I pop up in your world and tell you that I am here
You love to play that game, but you lose all the time, dear
I had to force you to think about what you mean though
I'm getting lost in your mind, I'm clouded by weed smoke
We get to talk and just talk about stuff in silence
I am not with you when I go check what the time is
I need you to stop all this talking
You need to worry about your goddamn self, girl

You think you know it all
You little girl, you're so thoughtless
Running around and you talk shit
I ain't never know what you're thinking
And you don't know what you started
You always seem on a mission
Oh, I don't know what to call it
You think you know it all
You little girl, you're so thoughtless
Running around and you talk shit
I ain't never know what you're thinking
And you don't know what you started
You always seem on a mission
Oh, I don't know what to call it

You little girl, you're so thoughtless
Running around and you talk shit
I ain't never know what you're thinking
And you don't know what you started
You always seem on a mission
Oh, I don't know what to call it
You think you know it all
You little girl, you're so thoughtless
Running around and you talk shit
I ain't never know what you're thinking
And you don't know what you started
You always seem on a mission
