I forgive, I forget
All the words I've never spoken
I've been lost, I've been hurt, I've been blamed
Sitting here on the floor
Feels like I've been high forever
Coming down, falling hard, all in vain

Flames and drama should've just made it harder
But it was so easy, darling, it was so easy loving you
Heavy-hearted, know that I've been so guarded
But it was so easy, darling, it was so easy, love
I'm pulled apart, yeah, you're broken, too
But it was fucked from the start, our love
Now I guess it's over, hurts that I still remember
But it was so easy darling, yeah, it was so easy loving you

'Cause there was oceans apart
We're so far, yeah
I open my heart, yeah
Thought I was the only one
But I knew from the start, yeah
We were falling apart, yeah
And I knew that we were done
We were done

Flames and drama shoulda just made it harder
But it was so easy, darling, it was so easy loving you
Now I'm heavy-hearted, who would've known
That it was so easy, darling, it was so easy, darling
I'm pulled apart and you're broken, too
It was fucked from the start, our love
But I guess it's over, hurts that I still remember
When it was so easy, darling, it was so easy loving you

Throw my heart in, threw it all afar
You gave all your love
She don't know me like you do
Like you say you do, ooh
I forgive, I forget, all those words were never spoken
I've been lost, I've been hurt, I've been blamed

Flames and drama should've just made it harder
But it was so easy, darling, it was so easy loving you
Heavy-hearted, now I'm heavy-hearted
Know that I've been so guarded, who would've known
That it was so easy, darling, it was so easy darling
I'm pulled apart, yeah, you're broken, too
It was fucked from the start, our love
But I guess it's over, hurts that I still remember
