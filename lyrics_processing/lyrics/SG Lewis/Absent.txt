And I think I've figured out the dying lie
Yes, the truth is that your dialect is half truth
Another conversation died alone
This is something we've created
Yes, well the sufferments abated
It doesn't have to be a prophecy
We could be both seeking destiny
It's fuckin' down to us and them
You can decide which one wins
Now's the time, are you
The hunter or the fuckin' hunted?
Absent, sometimes it feels like it's us against them
Absent, sometimes it feels like their angers are justified
If it feels like I'm absent from your conversation
Just keep on talkin' and you'll sure find out you're probably right
Now, it seems that there are no easy answers
To the same old question I've imposed

What does it mean? Why would you bother askin' me?
Like it's something I should know
Just 'cuz they paid me to take it
I guess their money gave me credence
Watch our records soar as you slow down
To buy the accident, so sick
Absent, sometimes it feels like it's us against them
Absent, sometimes it feels like their angers are justified
If it feels like I'm absent from your conversation
Just keep on talkin' and you'll sure find out you're probably right
Know that I'll pull your covers, bitch
Yes, I'm fixin' to knock that ego down
Well, I might slap your punk ass to the floor
Stupid motherfucker, nothin' but a buster
Still talkin' shit, devoid of soul, so you dig yourself a hole
Take the fun out, I load the gun for you
Incorrect cause and effect you've been sold
Live in the wrong, so ya live in the lies
Take the fun, load the gun, incorrect
Cause and effect I'm absent
Absent, sometimes it feels like it's us against them
Absent, sometimes it feels like their angers are justified
If it feels like I'm absent from your conversation
Just keep on talkin' and you'll sure find out you're probably right
