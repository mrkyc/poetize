Alright y'all
I want y'all to put your hands together
And to bring on the brothers that bound to lay more dips in your hips
More glide in your stride
Chi city in the building
And Mr. Southside
And if you don't think it's next you got the wrong damn address

Fuck your love, motherfuck your love
That's what Sir John say
You can laugh all you want but he's right as hell
Cupid's ain't around these days
I've heard many stories about how he made people all around the world fall in love
Well I got a call just the other day
Telling me where Cupid was
It said

Cupid's too busy in the club
At the bar
Rolling up (Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
And if you see him, let him know
Love is gone
I know, I'm sure
Boys and girls
You might also like
Love ain't dead, stupid
I'm the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive
I said, Love ain't dead, stupid
I'm the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive

The responsibility lies on me
Since Cupid ain't around
And when y'all really feeling like you're falling in love
When my music put's you right on down
And everybody (I see)
And I know (I know)
Some people really think they in love
But now without a love song
Something's gone way wrong
When Cupid...

Cupid's too busy in the club (In the club)
At the bar
Rolling up (Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
And if you see him, let him know (Should let him know)
Love is gone (Love is gone)
I know I'm sure
Boys and girls
Love ain't dead, stupid
I'm the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive
I said, Love ain't dead, stupid
I'm the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive
Love ain't dead, stupid
I'm the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive
I said, Love ain't dead, stupid
I'm the new Cupid
Throw your hands in the sky
'Cause love's still alive

Might sound weird
But a great night, if you in a real relationship, you understand what I'm saying
A great night with somebody you love... is difficult
Somebody you like is always good
Like is wonderful
You come home with some juice, the woman you like:
"Can I have some juice?"
"Gimme that juice, pour juice all over me"
Pour that juice all over that sexy body"
Let you be together three years and shit
"Can I have some juice?"
Bitch, why you want my juice?
You know I'm dehydrated
I try to come home and shit
