Haha, haha
It's on your brain again, huh
It's like a double sin
The way you think about gettin' it in
And I'ma say it again, say it like-like
Haha, haha
Yeah, it's on your brain again, huh
It's like a double sin
The way you think about gettin' it in
I'm gettin' in

Ever lay cold in bed at night? (Yeah)
Missin' me 'cause your heart wasn't right (Uh huh)
Then you close your eyes and you think of me (Yeah)
Since you can't sleep, since you've been daydreamin'
Wishin' we could get away, get away
You roll up, you po' up liquor
Thoughts won't get away, get away
My number done changed, so we can't talk, so
Now you see me on the television (Television)
Then you hear me on the radio (Radio)
Then you hit my best friend and ask him if he have my number
Then he hit you with the "hell no"
This bitch better get away, get away
I'm so sorry, it's so disrespectful
You really need to get away, get away
The crazy part is you don't know I be thinkin' of you
The same time you be thinkin' of me
From stage to studio, to pickin' out new wardrobes
In these showrooms, the top floors, wish I could five time her
Get away, get away
Shit, I should fly you out, so you can get away, get away
You might also like
You've got me flyin' home to smoke with you, yeah
(I'll go to Houston then Atlanta, baby)
When we fuck it feel like Vegas (Feel like Vegas)
When I'm freakin' you
Mm-mm-mm-mm
(Let's go smokin' in Amsterdam, let's go shoppin' in Paris
Fuckin' in Tokyo, what you want?)
You've got me flyin' home to smoke with you, ooh, yeah
When we fuck it feel like Vegas (Vegas)
When I'm freakin' you (Freakin' you)
All up in your V, your V (Freakin' you)

There's gotta be something better to talk about
Ask a stupid question, I'm walking out
I highly doubted I would make it out of my mama house
So finally got up off the couch, a nigga had to
Get away, get away
Find a little space, catch a vibe by myself, really
Get away, get away
This the first time that I felt good in a long time
There's gotta be better ways we can get along
I say my opinion, you take it wrong
You always bringin' up you heard about another bitch I was fuckin' on
Sometimes I just need me a second girl, you make me wanna
Get away, get away
Smoke something, drink something, ride around the city
Just get away, get away
Chillin' with the homies, gettin' high 'til I forgot about it
Callin' my other bitch on the telephone
Gotta be somewhere better I belong
I'm tired of everybody out here that be tryna get me to string along
They don't even know who they frontin' on
It's best that you get away, get away
You want fly on a plane with a nigga like me, baby?
Get away, get away
Yeah, well I'm tryna do the same thing, let's go
You've got me flyin' home to smoke with you, yeah
(I'll go to Houston then Atlanta, baby)
When we fuck it feel like Vegas (Feel like Vegas)
When I'm freakin' you
Mm-mm-mm-mm
(Let's go smokin' in Amsterdam, let's go shoppin' in Paris
Fuckin' in Tokyo, what you want?)
You've got me flyin' home to smoke with you, ooh, yeah
When we fuck it feel like Vegas (Vegas)
When I'm freakin' you (Freakin' you)
All up in your V, your V (Freakin' you)

Fucking with a nigga like me, she gotta be sick in the head too
Three o' clock, watch the moon, that's the goal
Adios, my heart broken, it hurt, I know that it ain't personal
I gotta get away, tryna be calm, cool, collected, smooth
But I look at your beautiful gluteus maximus
Toot it and boot it, something wrong, who would've knew it
Studying like I'ma student, but I'm still stupid
Tryna get you Gucci with the real Louis
And I gotta thank the Lord 'cause he will do it
For a real nigga who been really on the road movin'
Wanna be alone, tell the whole world get away
I be in my own world, I'm my own man with my old man mind
Inside a young man body, third eye, third leg
Bitch don't stand by me, these are not Versace
They still pulled up with the drac' and mink coat, Versace
Your favorite rapper mad, so he copy me
I fucked his bitch up in his bed
He pulled up and I still ain't wanna get away, get away
I been drinkin' 'cause we know you spend a long time, let's get away, get away

You've got me flyin' home to smoke with you, yeah
(I'll go to Houston then Atlanta, baby)
When we fuck it feel like Vegas (Feel like Vegas)
When I'm freakin' you
Mm-mm-mm-mm
(Let's go smokin' in Amsterdam, let's go shoppin' in Paris
Fuckin' in Tokyo, what you want?)
You've got me flyin' home to smoke with you, ooh, yeah
When we fuck it feel like Vegas (Vegas)
When I'm freakin' you (Freakin' you)
All up in your V, your V (Freakin' you)

Haha, haha
