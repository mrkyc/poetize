In the players club checking out your body babe
Steadily tossing that cash flow babe
Cause you drive me crazy
Won't you be my lady?
Betcha I can make your body talk to me
All I need is my CD, a bag of weed and some Hennessey, yeah
And I'm gonna strip you up and down, messing with your hair
And when you leave up out my room, you'll be walking bow-legged
I can keep your body coming like a CTA
You're dealing with a true baller babe
Giving you the keys to my Mercedes
And I'm not gonna stop 'til you scream my name
You say "BJ, make me high, keep on jumpin' like an Impala"
You slidin' that sexy ass down the pole like what, what, what

Now she was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cooking you've ever had
And I miss her
Hey woman if you're listening
