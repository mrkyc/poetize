Yeah, my dreams were realized, the wings was double fried
My green was stuffed between the peas and kettle fries
I quit with the beef then I, gave up the pork then I
Snatched up a cosign from one of the GOATs
Come on in, you lettin' out all the cold air, bro
Where you been? I know that you ain't forget about your folk
Late again, he may not come when you want
But I'm always up, on time
So roll up the smoke, la-la (La-la)
The weed's too potent so I had to call mama
Tell her how much I love her for cookin' them home products
When them bills would pile up, cereal with the water
If Lord couldn't help us, we had Hamburger Helper
When you want it done right, you gotta get it for yourself, uh
It don't seem right bein' older than my uncle
Some people call it ghetto, I prefer another level
But I'm 'bout to board this plane, I can't wait to see your face and hear you say

Come on in, close the door and feel the vibe
We got macaroni and cheese, collard greens and chicken inside
Can't forget the corn bread
Talkin' shit with the old heads
Mama dancin' to some Al Green
My Auntie join her and my Daddy said, "Go 'head"
While he shine up his pinky ring
Don't forget to close the screen
Come on in, close the door and feel the vibe
We got macaroni and cheese, collard greens and chicken inside
Can't forget the corn bread
Talkin' shit with the old heads
Mama dancin' to some Al Green
My Auntie join her and my Daddy said, "Go 'head"
'Bout to roll up the sticky green
'Bout to sneak and roll up
