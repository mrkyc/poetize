That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just right
You get that blessing in disguise
Wouldn't known

She say her ass ain't big enough
She feel her breasts ain't big enough
She think her abs ain't flat enough
Now when you add it all up
I love it

That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just right
You get that blessing in disguise
Wouldn't known it, girl you got me
Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime
Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime

(She like, hold up)
Let me pause for a minute
I know that this your jam
So sing this part for a nigga like
''Dida dida, dida dida dida, damn''
I bet seeing you get dressed in the morning baby baby
I swear it will make a nigga jump upon it
Cause your body, body, body, body perfect
You might also like
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just right
You get that blessing in disguise
Wouldn't known it, girl you got me
Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime
Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime
Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime
Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime

(She like, hold up)
Hell yeah a nigga friendly
Uh, It's in my blood girl, it's in me
How do you want these D's, but took them C's
Just to lead a itty bitty titty committee (Itty bitty titty committee)
All these girls yeah they need love
Real niggas need love too
And just because she thicker than you
Don't mean a nigga can't have fun with you too
Uh, oh Lawdy
Got better head than she got body
Gave a nigga head, then a nigga can't tread
I been up her bed and gettin' coke in the lobby
Because that body
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just right
You get that blessing in disguise
Wouldn't known it, girl you got it
That body perfect in my eyes
