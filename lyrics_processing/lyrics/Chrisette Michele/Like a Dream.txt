Looking extra fly
His sticks was pounding on the drums
When I caught his eye
And oh my gosh he looked at me
And he smiled at me
And he played to me
And I imagined that he spoke to me
Later on, I found his friend
I said, "Do you know that guy?"
He said, "Home girl, why sure I do."
And to my surprise
He's been saying who's that girl?
And he's feeling you
And he thinks you're cute
And he wants to try and talk to you
It's like a dream to me
It's like a dream to me
(Dream to me)
I would have never known
I would have never known

Through the crowd I'd seen a hand
Reaching out to me
I took a chance and took a grab
These hands were soft and sweet
I told him he was beautiful
And he played real sweet
And he smiled at me
And it was so real when he spoke to me
I put his digits in my phone
And I promise I'd call
Ran outside and told my girls
I spoke to drummer boy
I smiled the whole way to the crib
He was feeling me
And he spoke to me
Oh I can't believe he spoke to me
It's like a dream to me
It's like a dream to me
(Dream to me)
I would have never known
I would have never known
It's like a dream to me
It's like a dream to me
Oh, my gosh, can you believe it's true?
Mr. Drummer Boy spoke to me, yes, it's true
Maybe soon, he will call me his girl
And I'll call him my boy, you know
He could play the drums for my shows
It's like a dream to me
It's like a dream to me
