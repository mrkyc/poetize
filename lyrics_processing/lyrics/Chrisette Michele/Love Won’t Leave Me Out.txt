Oh, yeah

Here I go with my heart wide open
I'm all frustrated again
Yeah, I locked the door, threw away the key
And said I'll never let no one in
I was gullible
I was wrapped up in the web you caught me in
So vulnerable
True love lost its meaning
And after self-evaluation, oh
I found I lost me in translation, oh, oh

See the girl with the broken heart (Heart)
See the girl with the ugly scars (Scars)
Is now the girl with the brand new start (Start), oh yeah

Now I know how to love somebody
I've learned love is out there for me
No, love, there's no way that love forgot
Love won't leave me out
I know how to love somebody
I've learned love will come back to me
No, love, there's no way that love forgot
Love won't leave me out

You could go on hope with no doubts
It's the way love goes
It'll take you through and it always brings you out
It won't leave you stranded
Though you may feel abandoned
My experience, ooh, is my evidence
And with a little evaluation, oh
I found I got a whole lot of patience, oh, oh, oh

And now the girl with the broken heart (Heart)
And the girl with the ugly scars (Scars)
Is now the girl with the brand new start (Yeah), oh yeah, yeah

Now I know how to love somebody

No, love, there's no way that love forgot
Love won't leave me out
I can feel my heart again (Feel my heart again)
This time I'm not afraid
I can open up my ear
Hear what true love's got to say
This time I want it all
No matter run or fall
I won't back at all when love calls

Now I know how to love somebody
