Red heels
After I hop out them big wheels
They're giving me so much attention
Yeah, they're looking at me like I ain't real
Hey, black dot shades
Like I step right out of a cover page
Walking in slow motion in the wind
I got 'em coming to me
Oh, I hear em say is
I'll be there for you
I bet they don't even have a clue
I know your eyes tell you, you love me
But that don't mean you do
You can do nothing for me
If your love isn't true
Your eyes tell you, you love me
But that don't mean you do
And I ain't gon let you hurt me
When you see someone new
Just 'cause you're in visual love
Visual love

If you came in to call yourself my man
Hey, all games aside
If you wanna get to me do it right
