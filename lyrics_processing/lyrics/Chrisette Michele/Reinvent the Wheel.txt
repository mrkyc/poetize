They frame and flash and advertise every time I open my mouth
But one intention every time I open my mouth
I might look crazy, blame God, who made me
That's how He made me
Reach every nation anywhere that they ear can hear it
I can rebound, adjust, one sound, I'm fit, no air
I might look crazy, blame God, who made me
That's how He made me

I'm not one sound, I'm not one voice
I am not here, keeping the wheel rolling, wheel
I reinvented, I redirected, the unexpected, that's my gift
And I respect it cause I was sent yeah to break the wheel
Wheel, set to break the wheelm reinvent the wheel
That's why I am here, that's why I to break the wheel
Sent to break the wheel, reinvent the wheel
That's why I am here, that's why I, to break the wheel

Cause I break instead of crashing and do what's been done
If you crazy, do the same thing, want to do, I can
God is always good, yeah, and he holds your path, yeah
So you can't be watcted, hidden make you eyes
I can't be you, mimicking ain't no fun
And I can't keep winning races I already won
Today is now, yesterday happened
I need fresh oil under my action
