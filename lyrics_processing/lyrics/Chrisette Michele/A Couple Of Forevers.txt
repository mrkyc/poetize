I see it clear, my heart is here
We got each other, let's take it from there
And if I could I'd love you a forever at time, oh, oh, oh
What we've been through no one else knows
'Cause all that matters is how far this goes
And it will go until it starts again, oh, oh

Me and you are built like armor
Nothing can stop love from loving on us
And I'm not asking for much

Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
I'm talking 'bout forever
Just a couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never, ooh

It can get hard, damn, it gets rough
It can get crazy but not for us
'Cause we gotta struggle just to stay apart, oh
