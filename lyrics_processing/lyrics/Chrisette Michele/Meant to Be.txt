For the first time I saw your face
I knew my heart was in trouble
And the first night I screamed your name
I knew we found each other
It was love that had taken us over
Felt your touch as my eyes glazed over
Yeah my heart beats slow, oh bless your soul
I think we're meant for each other

Baby I don't usually fall in love
Now, I don't usually do this
Baby I don't usually fall in love
Now, I ain't used to the feeling
Baby I don't usually fall in love
Now, I don't usually do this
Baby I don't usually fall in love
Now, I ain't used to the feeling

I love you so, I love you so much
Don't wanna go without your touch
I love you so, I love you so much
I love you so, I love you so much
Without your touch, I can't imagine
You without my love will never happen
Baby we were meant to be
Baby we were meant to be

Now it's go time and we're quick
We're pacing and it ain't no race but we want it
And it don't make no sense to wait
We grow baby, be my lover
Love will always win in the ending
We'll be more than just friends forever
Think I found my soul and we both know
It's more than lust and the feeling

Baby I don't usually fall in love
Now, I don't usually do this
Baby I don't usuallyfall in love
Now, I ain't used to the feeling
Baby I don't usually fall in love
Now, I don't usually do this
Baby I don't usually fall in love
Now, I ain't used to the feeling

I love you so, I love you so much
Don't wanna go without your touch
I love you so, I love you so much
I love you so
Me without your touch, I can't imagine
You without my love will never happen
Baby we were meant to be
Baby we were meant to be
'Til death do us part
May this feeling last forever
'Til death do us part
May this feeling last forever
'Til death do us part
May this feeling last forever
'Til death do us part
