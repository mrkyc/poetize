Singing 'bout a man that's gone
And crying while I look out the window
It's easy to move on
I don't care if he calls no more, whoa
At least that's what I tell myself to make it through
The days and nights alone here
When I'm missing you
I'm tryin' not to trip
But I don't feel comfortable
'Cause every time I go to turn on the radio
They're playin' my song
Every time that I hear it
My heart wants to jump out of my chest to search for it
They're playin' my song
And my whole body feels it
It's crying out
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
They're playin' my song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
They're playin' my song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
They're playin' my song

Waiting for a telephone call
And holding so tight to my pillow
See, life really started
The moment that you left me alone, whoa
At least that's what I tell myself to make it through
The days and nights alone here
When I'm missing you
I try not to trip
But I don't feel comfortable
Every time I go to turn on the radio
They're playin' my song
Every time that I hear it
My heart wants to jump out of my chest to search for it
They're playing my song
And my whole body feels it
It's crying out
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
They're playin' my song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
They're playin' my song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
They're playin' my song
Don't think that I'm wasting my time
Crying and wishing you could be mine
Gotta the feeling under control
Till I turn on the radio
They're playin' my song
Every time that I hear it my heart wants to
Jump out of my chest to search for it
They're playin' my song
And my whole body feels it
It's crying out
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
They're playin' my song
Every time that I hear it
My heart wants to jump out of my chest to search for it
They're playin' my song
And my whole body feels it
It's crying out
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
They're playin' my song

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
They're playin' my song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
