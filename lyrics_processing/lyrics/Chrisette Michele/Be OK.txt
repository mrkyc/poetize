I'm a take my Lexus to the mall
Get a little black dress
Just because
Me and my boo just broke it off
I'm be fly
Although he's gone
I don't really care about
Who he's with
I'm get mine and he'll get his
Even though I was in love with him
I really hope the best for them

Very sentimental
And my cryings detrimental
Tell me what I'm getting into
I can't lose my mind
I think it's time for me to let go
'Cause my heart can't take it no more
You were all I lived for
But I leave you behind

I'm a be OK
I'm a be OK
I'll survive, I'll be fine
I won't cry, no way

Don't you talk
I'll move on
Baby, walk away
All I gave to you
I'm so broke and blue
Make believe it's cool
I'm so over you

I'm a keep my head up
Hold it high
Really did my best
God knows you try
Even though it hurts
I will survive
I'll wipe my eyes
I'll say it loud
Take a deep breath
And count to 10
Today's a new day
I'll start again
I'm a find myself so deep within
I'm a survivor
I'll win


I gotta rock the mic
I'll be right back
Gotta catch a flight
My samsonite's packed
Three months rapping all around the map
Girl, I see you on the internet on iChat
Cyberspace is the place to see my lady
Baby, we can instant message on the daily
Halfway you could meet me out in Asia
'Cause 90 days without seeing you is crazy
We got three days banging up in Shang Hi
Last day I see the water
Hanging in your eye
I know my mama told me
Not to make a lady cry
But that's impossible
When all I gotta say is bye
But I'm a...
I'm a...

All I gave to you
I'm so broke and blue
Make believe it's cool
I'm so over you
I'm so broke and blue
Make believe it's cool
