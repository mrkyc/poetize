Every single time I look deep into your eyes
What's the tingle that I feel?
At the touch of your hand up and down my spine
What's so funny in my belly?
Tryna tell me something
Feels like butterflies
What's the feeling?
What's the tingle?
What's the tickle?
What's the world got for you and I?
And I swear it's real
Yes, it is can't nobody ever tell me otherwise
And I swear I feel
No, I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
Is this the way love feels?
Have I found it for real?
What will time reveal?
Is this the way love feels?
Every time I hear your voice
Well, it seems I have no choice
But to be amazed
It's like music to my ears
How I really love to hear everything you say
Does love really have a way of speaking
In every unconventional way?
