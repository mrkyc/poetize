You're who I desire, you light my fire
With every kiss, you take me higher
Feeling like your lovin' I just cannot resist
There's something that's makin' me hold on
There's no one I'd rather share my good lovin' with
But I promised I'd wait 'til I'm ready for this

One day we'll make love, passion unheard of
I'll be your woman, if I have my way
We will see heaven, lovin' together
We won't stop ever, if I have my way

I love your touch, it makes me crumble
I'm in love so much, look what you've done
Please don't whisper anything else in my ear
My body, my heart and my soul is high
Let me find the strength to get on up outta here
'Cause one day, the way we feel, we'll be alright

One day we'll make love (One day), passion unheard of
(Passion unheard of)
I'll be your woman (Yeah), if I have my way
(We will see heaven)
We will see heaven (Hey), lovin' together
(Lovin' together)
We won't stop ever, if I have my way
