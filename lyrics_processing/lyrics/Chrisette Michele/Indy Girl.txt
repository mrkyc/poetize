I been out here by myself for a really long time
(it's whack, it's lonely)
Holding microphones and breaking backs, stacking hell of dimes
(it's whack, it's lonely)
I've been tryna smile on the carpet scene tryna look like I be loving being free
I want somebody waiting for me when I get back home tonight

She got this and oh, she got that
She's got red and black Chanel bags
Must be cool to be independent
Yeah, I'm cute but girls need a man
She got this and oh, she got that
She's got red and black Chanel bags
Must be cool to be independent
Yeah, I'm cute but girls need a man

Indy girl, I'm on that indy, indy
I'm on that fly, fly, I'm on that fly, fly
And I know you see me but boy when you watch me, watch me
You don't say hi, hi, you don't say hi, hi
Indy girls need love, indy girls need love too
Indy girls need boys, get at me if you want to
Indy girls need love, indy girls need love too
Indy girls are human, we work hard just like you do

You're slowly making money, taking Uber everywhere I go
Cause nobody drives me home, it's lonely
It's sexy walking with security and looks good on the 'Gram
But I'd rather have a man to hold me
Cover me in fur cause my heart's gone cold
Carry a Prada bag cause I don't have a hand to hold
I'm just an indy girl repping independents
Cause it's cool, but it's bogus

She got this and oh, she got that
