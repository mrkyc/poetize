Ah, yeah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

I've seen it, done it, ran it, run it
Been to the bottom and I came back from it
That'll be a pain in the pit of my stomach
Don't regret a thing, just keep it one hundred
(I) Up in the drama and the bad news
(And I) I've been a struggle in the damn blues
I shed tears over silliness
Seen love blow up, as real as it really gets

Rain starts pourin' and it don't stop
Let myself drown, no, I will not
Smile on my pretty mug
I get right back on my horse and I giddy up
I'm in the sky and I won't drop
Have a piece of my pie, no, you will not
But if you feel like me and it is what it is
Then what's it gon' be tonight?

Tell 'em, baby, I'm a star tonight
I'm up in the sky tonight
For the world to see
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you, baby
I'ma do me tonight (Tonight)
'Cause, baby, I'm a star tonight (Tonight)
I'm up in the sky tonight
So give me one more dream
'Cause I'm shinin', shinin', shinin' (Woo)

No fight, did it how you wanted to do it (Do it)
Under the weather, love fell like a fluid

So tonight's a celebration
Raisin' a toast to me bein' happy

Rain starts pourin' and it don't stop
Let myself drown, no, I will not
Smile on my pretty mug
I get right back on my horse and I giddy up

And every eye is on me now
(Lookin', feelin' like a million)
I'm in the sky, can't touch the ground
(So high I can't even feel the ground)
I can't let nobody bring me down (Down, down)
So if you feel what I feel right now (Now)
