Cry every night, I do
Cry every night for you
Why you leave me out here
With these wounds? I'm fragile
My side really needs your back
You slowly move out my hair
Why you got me living out
These dreams without you?

My heart ain't whole
Just me without my soul
My being needs you
I'm just part of what makes one of two
I'm just one side without my right side
Lose my backbone without my right side
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul
I'm incomplete without my baby
I'm just part of me without what makes me
I'm just one half without my soul
One half without my soul

Yes, I'm a big girl, yeah
Yes, I can handle this, yeah
Nothing comes better then when
It's you and I
Tried it before, I did
Forgive me because I dipped
Left you lonely one side
Only let me back in

Give me one time and I'll do better
But I won't go, we flow together
I cannot crave you like this anymore though
I cannot crave you like this anymore
Give me one time and I'll be cool
Mama won't go, she just needs you
I cannot crave you, I just cannot crave you
I cannot crave you like this anymore
