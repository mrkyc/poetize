Some days my work seems so in vain
I talk to you, you don't hear nothing that I say
What's up with this game?
Why am I so forgiving?
Why am I always checking for these fools?
If he ain't hearing none of homegirl's rules
Why do I play?
I'd rather play alone

Oh, I can't play a fool anymore (No)
No, I don't need a game anymore
(You could play the fool, yeah)

Hit the highway
Call you a cab, gimme back my keys
Goodbye to baggage, you ain't bagging me
I'm gonna smile when I wave
(Goodbye, goodbye)
I can take the low road
Ain't got no pride, I ain't putting up a fight
Get out the boxing ring, it's TKO tonight
Walk that way
I'd rather play alone
