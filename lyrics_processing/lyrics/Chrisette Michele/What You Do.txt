(Hey, hey) Say it with your actions
(Actions) Saying those words to me
Doesn't mean anything
(Hey, hey) I don't want to hear 'em
(Hear 'Em) Baby you can keep those three
You might as well not even speak

Many different times before, you were almost out the door
Then you'd say it and I'd forgive everything
Well, I'm sorry to report, that's not working anymore
Now I need to see if that's really what you mean

No more "I'm sorry," (No more)
"I love you" (baby), I need proof
Baby boy, it's all in what you do
I love you (baby), if it's true
Baby boy it's all in what you do

Say it with your actions (your actions)
Say it in the way you touch (you touch)
And the things that you do for us (do for us, hey)
(Hey, hey) I don't want to be mean
(Be mean) But when it comes to this love
(This love) Saying it just ain't enough
