Sometimes you can work it out
Sometimes you can't
Sometimes you're forced to watch everything fall apart
It's outta your hands
Sometimes leaving is easy
Sometimes it ain't
Sometimes it hurts to know
The loving you had is slowly fading away

You can say whatever you like
As long as we just say goodbye

Blame it on me (blame it on me)
Say it's my fault (say it's my fault)
Say that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart
I really don't care, I ain't crying no more
Say I'm a liar, a cheater
Say anything that you want as long as it's over

I ain't a quitter
I just ain't the type
I tried to see you through
I tried to make it to the finishing line
You thought it was meant to be, yeah?
I admit, so did I
Every once in a while
You think you figured it out
Sometimes you're not right

Yes, I love you
But I really got to lose you
Freedom's where I wanna be
Yes, I'll probably always love you
But I'm moving
Gotta do this for me
