Yeah I'm writing you a letter
With the diamond on my finger
No, you never did me bad
Someone else can do me better
Let me go, boy you can breathe
You don't get no more of me
You don't get no more of me
You don't get no more of me

I had to go and I needed out
I've been holding on for too long
We were strong then and
They know that we were strong
I had to run and did the thing
And I changed my number, don't call
I won't pick it up
We ain't what we were before
We were, we were
We were, we were

Yeah I'm writing you a letter
With the diamond on my finger
No, you never did me bad
Someone else can do me better
Let me go, boy you can breathe
You don't get no more of me
You don't get no more of me
You don't get no more of me
Let me go, boy you can breathe
You don't get no more of me
Let me go, boy you can breathe
You don't get no more
