We have a bit of jealousy
I might ask, "Why she call?"
You might ask, "Who is he?"
But I can never think of letting go
Ain't no other man that could have me
No way
No how
No circumstance
If you thought about it
No, think again
Baby, slow your roll
You ain't leaving me, no
I ain't letting you go
All I ever think about is you
And I guess I never really ever loved no one
All I ever think about is you
From the rising of the moon
Til the setting of the sun
It's all around me
And I'm feeling so confused
I'm really scared lying here 'bout to fall
Cause all I ever think about is
Trying to get back, yeah
I wanna get back to you
'Cause all I ever think about is you

Just to keep you here with me
Cause you already know what I wanna do
Can't nobody come between me and you
No problems
No family
No drama
No friends
If you thought about it
No, think again
Baby, slow your roll
You ain't leaving me, no
I ain't letting you go
All I ever think about is you

Tryin' to get back, yeah

'Cause all I ever think about is you
Oh, I'm not with you, baby
It gets so hard for me to focus
I'll say a prayer so that nothing happens to you
Waiting on your phone call saying
"Baby, won't you come back to me?"
Oh, oh
And when you get back
I can't wait to hug and kiss you
Can't wait to demonstrate just how much I miss you
You take my breath away
Don't want to wait and say
All I ever think about is you
And I guess I never really ever loved no one
All I ever think about is you
From the rising of the moon
'Til the setting of the sun
It's all around me
And I'm feeling so confused
I'm really scared lying here, 'bout to fall
I'm 'bout to fall in love with you
Tryin' to get back, yeah, I wanna get back to you

I'm really scared lying here 'bout to fall
I don't know what to say
Trying to get back, yeah
