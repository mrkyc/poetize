Do you know you can come to me for anything?
No, I mean, anything
And I'll give you everything
So

Tell me your secrets
And I'll tell you mine
Every truth, every lie
Every wrong, every right
Every heartbreak, every setback
Every mistake, every crime
Make me your confidant
Make me your best friend
If you lose or if you win
If you're a saint or if you sin
And if I don't understand
I'll do the best that I can

'Cause oh, some people search high and low
For someone that makes them whole
So I'm not letting go

'Cause you mean that much to me
So take all this love from me
I'm giving you every part of me
All of this heart of me
Here is my offering
'Cause you mean that much to me
So take all this love from me
I'm giving you every part of me
All of this heart of me
Here is my offering
'Cause you mean that much to me
