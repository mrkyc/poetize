When loving was pure
Love ain't going away
Love is always secure
Life's not always perfect
But love's always forever
Let's let true love connect
Let's try lasting together
I'm so ready to love
I'm so ready to promise my all
I'm so ready to give
Til the day that my life is no more
I'll be everything
That this woman can possibly be
'Cause I'm ready to be like the olden days
When commitment was golden
Be the man of my dreams
And get down on one knee, love
Say you'll be all I need
And then ask me to marry you, my love
Let's take two golden bands
And let's walk down the aisle, Love
I'll say I do and you'll say I do
Make a golden commitment, oh
