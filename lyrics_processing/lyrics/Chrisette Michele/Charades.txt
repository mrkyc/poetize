Boy, you're so sexy
You think you got it made
You smile when you lie
Get away from me
You're talking out
Two sides of your face
But I'm supposed to go
Well, I'm not OK

I'm so guarded
I've been hurt, see
I'm so cold now
Someone burned me
Yeah, I like you
Yeah, you like me
But I can see

Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see

Oh, you got me guarded like an army grenade
Don't hurt me, I don't have what it takes
If you wonder why I'm throwing your shade
(Your charades)

I like different kind of shapes, different swaggers
But I can see beyond the face of the kiss

I've been hurt, see
I'm so cold now
Someone burned me
Yeah, I like you
Yeah, you like me
But I can see

Crossing the line is something that I wouldn't do
Me and your brother
We've been cool since back in middle school
And now I'm thinking beautiful
Two crosses on the spiritual
I am counting dead presidents
Off in the living room
Feeling you my Zeus
Yeah, they call me Deuce
They sure are for seducing
Introduce you to my coop
Coop, this is baby!
