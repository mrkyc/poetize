When I saw you then my heart took full control
Can we go?
Ooh baby, somewhere we can get to know each other
I'm kinda anxious
See I'm not the kinda girl that would do this
I'm so far outside my world
But if I don't, I don't tell you baby, it'll kill me to never know
Don't you leave me out
(Don't leave me)
Out on a limb
(Out on a limb)
Can't you see me?
(Can't you see me?)
Here on the edge
(Here on the edge)
Boy, don't tell me no, don't tell me no
Ooh, my heart is fragile
La la la, la la la, oh oh, fragile
La la la, la la la, oh oh, fragile
La la la, la la la, oh oh, fragile
La la la, la la la, oh oh, aye
Boy don't tell me no, don't tell me no
Ooh, my heart is fragile

But somethin's different when I'm lookin' in your eyes
I loose, I loose my cool, baby
The closer that you get to me
I can't take another second
Ooh, I'm jumpin' out my skin
If lovin' is the game then boy you gotta let me win
Ooh baby, baby, baby, it's like I can barely breathe
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't leave
(Don't leave me)
Out on a limb
(Out on a limb)
Can't you see me?
(Can't you see me?)
Here on the edge
(Here on the edge)
Boy, don't tell me no, don't tell me no
'Cause my heart is fragile
La la la, la la la, oh oh, fragile
La la la, la la la, oh oh, fragile
La la la, la la la, oh oh, fragile
La la la, la la la, oh oh, aye
Boy, don't tell me no, don't tell me no
'Cause my heart is fragile
I ain't beggin', I won't plead, I'm just askin' you to see
(Come and see me, come and see me, boy)
(Come and see me, come and see me, boy)
I ain't like this normally, I'm acting kinda foolishly
But don't you think that you and me could really be
Don't leave

Can't you see me?
