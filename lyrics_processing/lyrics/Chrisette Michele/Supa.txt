Doesn't mean I don't get mad
It just means I won't stay mad for long
Just because I love you
Doesn't mean I don't have bad days
Sometimes I wanna be alone
Just because I love you
Doesn't mean I'm a robot
I am a human being with feelings
Oh, let me get this straight
You got an attitude
Cause I don't wanna do things your way
I can't believe this
I don't need this
I'm a find somebody else that's gon' love me
When I'm pretty
When I don't look my best
When I don't feel like I gotta have an "S" on my chest
Have an "S" on my chest
Yes, "S" on my chest
I can't be supa all the time
