Oh my God
Here's the thing I need you to stop treatin' me
As if I'm simple or naive
As if I don't know nothin' 'bout the world
I understand you think you're protectin' me
Well, I could use a little room to breathe
And the respect you give a woman not a girl
Here's the thing I appreciate all the love
The constant caterin', kisses and hugs
But lately I'm wonderin' what you do it for
If the reason you act all over sweet is
'Cause you want to keep me on a leash
I have no choice but to show you the door
If you wanna cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down, I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman, I am not your porcelain doll
If you wanna cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down, I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman, I am not your porcelain doll

Well, here's the thing I really don't mind the clothes
I love a nice dress with some open toes
But a trophy I'm not so baby think again, hey
And here's the thing you always wanna hold my hand
And say things to me like I'm the man
So let me do what a man's suppose to do, okay
Well, here's the thing you can be the man all the while
Understandin' I'm not a child
You're the man for sure but baby I'm grown too, hey

Said you gotta respect me totally otherwise I'm gonna up and leave
And baby I know you don't want me to do that
Babe you gotta respect me totally, so when I say back up off of me
Just kiss my cheek and politely move back
Oh, you wanna cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down, I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman, I am not your porcelain doll, hey, hey, hey
You wanna cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down, I'm not your possession
