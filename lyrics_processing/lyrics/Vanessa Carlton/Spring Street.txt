Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah

I was heading down to Spring Street
With a suitcase in my hand
I'm filled with love and life and grand illusions
I knew you'd understand
And I left you by the stairwell
And your eyes were wet with tears
Mother, you knew you had to let me go
Even after all these years

And we sing (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
And she said (Nah-nah-nah-nah nah nah nah)
"Well, walk on" (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
You're alright (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)

And I found myself a new life
And I've been living with some friends
And we hold on to dreams and live like kings
Like the days will never end
And I left him by the statue
And his eyes were filled with tears
Lover, you knew you had to let me go
Even after all these years
You might also like
And we sing (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
And he said (Nah-nah-nah-nah nah nah nah)
"Well, walk on" (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
"You're alright" (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)

And everything changes
And friends become strangers
And what we hold so dear slips away
The past keeps on fading
But I'll never forget you
It's hard to see that you're a part of me
Even when we have to say

Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah
"Walk on" (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
And we sing (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
"We're alright" (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)

And I moved out of the city
To start a family of my own
And when I look into my daughter's eyes
I don't feel so alone
And as I walk her down to Spring Street
And she holds on to my hand
Mother, you knew my eyes would be wet with tears
And now I understand

Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah
And I said (Nah-nah-nah-nah nah nah nah)
"Walk on" (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
"And thank you" (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)

Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah nah
Walk on (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
I'm alright  (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
And hold on (Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah)
