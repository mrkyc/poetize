Holiday, and I come home
I hope to see this boy I know
I can't wait for us to be alone
Flipping through the radio
We sing along to the indie show
The songs they play mean more than I can say

And the tape I made you
Hope you think of me when it plays through
I'm kind of sad now that it's done
And you think my time's for free
In all the ways you say to me
Sweet versions of "let's wait and see"

But you're always a golden boy
And I'm the girl that you enjoy
My parents say, "Isn't he a gifted son?"
Time is always passing by
And still I have to wonder why
You can't come to tell me I'm the one

Summer goes and we have grown
We have our friends, live on our own
Still, I'm not the girl you want me to be
You might also like
Say gravity can bend the time
Funny, I always liked your mind
But this whole thing is crushing me

But you're always a golden boy
And this girl's heart that you destroy
You smile at me and then you have your fun
Time is always passing by
Still I give you another try
And hope that you will see that I'm the one

You say you're scared to get too close
Come let's see how it goes
I see you now at the show
Seventh in the seventh row
And now you look at me
And see what I've known for so long
It's sad that you can be
So love and so wrong

Came to say, that I've moved
I see your face, you don't approve
Guess you could say that I'm already gone
But you'll always be my a golden boy
And I'm the summer girl that you enjoy
Some melodies are best left undone
I feel the time pass away
But in my songs you'll always stay
I don't need you to tell me I'm the one

No, no, no
I don't need you to tell me I'm the one
