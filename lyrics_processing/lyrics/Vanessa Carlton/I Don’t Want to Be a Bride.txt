I like your company
You've got a fresh philosophy
Never knew such a gentleman
And you can take me on a cheap vacation
I don't want to have expectations
'Cause you could be the end of me

And I don't need a house on a hill, a swing on a tree
A grandfather clock, porcelain for tea
A garden with rose and jasmine
Gonna get drunk on a bottle of wine
No better way to pass the time
Forever by your side

But I don't want to be a bride
Apologies to your mother
I wanna be your girl
And spend this life with you
But I don't want to wear white
You know it's too late for that
Can we keep the ever after, love?
Oh, could it be?
You might also like
Don't need no golden ring
It'd be no match for the love you'd bring
From London to Tennessee
And we could catch a train to another life
On a whim under the moonlight
I promise you, will you promise me?

Our last names on a wooden sign
Arm in arm where the river starts to wind
Forever by your side

But I don't want to be a bride
Apologies to each other
I wanna be your girl
And spend this life with you
But I don't want to wear white
Oh, you know it's too late for that
But can we keep the ever after?
Oh, could it be just you and me?
Ah, ah, ah

And we will
(Live like kings under lavender)
(Skies, skies we will)
(Live like kings under lavender)
(Skies, skies we will)
(We will live like kings under lavender skies, skies)
Built a poem, we kept a rhyme
Wrapped our love in golden twine
And we wrote, we wrote a legacy
Just you and me
(We will live like kings under lavender)
Just you and me
