When the lights go out and the clothes go on
All the money in the air and all them bad bitches gone
She walks out that door a little slower than before
Every nigga in the parking lot trying to take her home

But she knows this ain't what she came here for
She knows she just trying to stack some dough
She knows they be thinking she's a ho
Girl get your money, don't let them turn it in to something ugly
There's no need to hurry
Pretty is what pretty does
You'll always be pretty because you fall but get up
Pretty is what pretty does
You'll always be pretty because you're still full of love

He want a lap dance, he want a chance
He want to sell her a dream but she ain't buying
She wants real love, somebody that'll never judge her
Somebody who don't want to just fuck her, somebody who respects a hustler

But she knows this ain't what she came here for
She knows she just trying to stack some dough
She knows they be thinking she's a ho
Just get your money, don't let them turn it in to something ugly
There's no need to hurry
Pretty is what pretty does
You'll always be pretty because you fall but get up
Pretty is what pretty does
You'll always be pretty because you're still full of love

Ok  hair extensions and half splits don't make you
Pretty  something that comes from within and not on
Some man  she be up there with the stars
Shinning bright, like a diamond, so inspiring

Pretty is what pretty is what pretty does
You'll always be pretty because you fall but get up
Pretty is what pretty does
You'll always be pretty because you're still full of love
Pretty is what pretty does
You'll always be pretty because you fall but get up
Pretty is what pretty does
