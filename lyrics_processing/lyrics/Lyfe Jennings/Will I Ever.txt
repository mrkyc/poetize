Ready to let down your guard
Finding somebody's just so hard

How do you find the one you dream about
(How do you find it? Yeah)

It's kinda hard for me to figure out
(And I know you're ready to settle down)
I know you're ready to settle down
If there's a God above
Please tell me

Tell me
Will I ever fall in love
(Will I ever fall in love?)
Will I be alone forever
(I just gotta know)
Will I ever fall in love
(Will somebody please tell me?)
Or will I be alone forever
Does it feel like ya
Moving too fast
Does it feel like ya
Want something you can't have
Does it feel like ya
Living in the past
And the thought of going home alone
Again makes you sad
Does it feel like ya
Feeling so bad
Does it feel like ya
Getting so mad 'cause it feels like ya
Just want someone to call
To tell ya that you're human after all

I know you're ready to settle down
If there's a God above
