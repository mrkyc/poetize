Baby, baby

First things first, baby, I apologize
For all of the lies that I've told you up to now
I promise I'll change my ways if you stay
In my heart, in my mind, in my world
'Cause you're the only girl for me
So if you're thinkin bout walkin' out
Let's talk it out and work it out now
No sense in tearin' down
This love we feel, 'cause it's oh, so real and

I can't see you bein' with no one else
But me, baby
I can't even stand
Thinkin' 'bout you touchin' another man
I can't see you bein' with no one else
But me, baby
I can't even stand
Thinkin' 'bout you touchin' another man

What must I do for you to show you
That I mean what I say, Lord, I pray we can stay together
But it don't matter, if you stay or if you leave
Cause in my heart you will always be
See you're the only girl for me
Even in high school, you were so cool
What a pleasure just to know you, girl
There's nothin' in the world
I won't do for you 'cause
