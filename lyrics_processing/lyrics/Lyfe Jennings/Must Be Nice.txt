Someone whose smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Havin' someone who loves you despite your faults, oh no
Must be nice
Havin' someone who talks the talk, but also walks the walk
Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands that a thug has feelin's too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go, ohh

'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone (Even when, oh)
She'll be by your side still holdin' on (She'll be by your side)
And even when those 20's stop spinnin' (Yeah)
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear (Woo)
She'll still be here
