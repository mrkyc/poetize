We came, we saw, we conquered
We almost had it, some call it magic
I often imagine just what could've happened
If we stayed a little longer girl I always wondered
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever crack a smile from an old memory?
Do you ever sit and think maybe we moved to hastily?
Maybe it's me but, just you wait and see, just you wait and see
You're gonna wake up one of these mornings
Reaching out for me, but I'm long gone, long gone
And that's when you realize you're still mine
And I'm still yours, that's forever, that's for sure

And you'll always be my girl
And I'll always be your man
And you'll always be my woman
And we will never change

We laughed, we cried, made the best of our time
Together, nothing lasts forever, if I could do it all again
I'd never let you go, I'd always let you know
You'll always have a hold, everything I hoped to be
If you ever, ever, ever, ever, ever think about me
If you could do it all again, would you do it differently
And do you ever get lonely, or is it just me?
Just you wait and see, just you wait and see
You're gonna wake up one of these mornings
Reaching out for me, but I'm long gone, long gone
And that's when you realize you're still mine
And I'm still yours, that's forever, that's for sure
