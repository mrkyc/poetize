Sitting here thinking about
All the innocent people I done hurt in my past
Relationships, never felt the slightest bit bad
Until it happened to me
It's funny how we're so quick to laugh
When it's someone else
But then when it happens to us
The joke is never as funny as we all thought it was
Before we felt the same thing

And it's true that it's no fun
When the rabbits got the gun
And you're in love with the one that hurts you most
They say karma is a bitch
And I say I agree with it
Cause this whole experience has let me know

That breaking a woman's heart is like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang
And it came right back to you again
So remember that when it's happening to you

Used to play a lotta games with no conscious
Couple different lovers at once with no problem
Loved the way it felt to have everyone wanting me
Now I'm sitting here tryin to be strong but I'm hurting
And the sad part of it all is I deserve this
This was meant to teach me a lesson
It's working perfectly

And it's true that it's no fun
When the rabbits got the gun
And you're in love with the one that hurts you most
They say karma is a bitch
And I say I agree with it
Cause this whole experience has let me know

That breaking a woman's heart is like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang
And it came right back to you again
So remember that when it's happening to you
Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
And heaven won't help you hide if you break her heart
Try ya best to be honest
Try to keep every promise
Cause in the end if it doesn't work out
She won't wanna be friends
And she gone want revenge

That breaking a woman's heart is like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang
And it came right back to you again
