Yeah
We always complainin about how bad stuff is for us
Complainin bout a light dim
Hell there's people that dont even got lights
You know so I wanna tell everybody listenin man
Embrace your struggle cause no matter what man
It coulda been worse. true story c'mon
(Verse 1)
I was going through some changes in my life
Cussin and complainin every night
Tellin God the way he treatin me ain't right
And how i dont deserve this
Then a voice somewhere came to me
And said you have the audacity
To fix your mouth to disrespect
How soon we forget
And he said remember
When you were sick and you got better
Remember, i put your family back together
Remember, i coulda cut you off forever so
No matter how bad you think it hurts
(Chorus)
It coulda been worse
You coulda been dead
You coulda been paralyzed
Confiined to a bed
You coulda lost everything
Shoulda lost everything
But somebodys watching you
And gave you another chance
Yeah

Its so funny how we think we got it rough
When there are babies who got mommas hooked on drugs
And this depression got folks losing they homes
They spent they whole life saving for
Its better in comparison
Tell me you'll switch places with them
You only go to God to complain
But if you ever went to Him to just say thanks
Don't you remember he didn't let that disease take you
Remember he didn't even get a thank you
Remember how could he love you just to hate you
So no matter how bad you think it hurts
(Chorus)
It coulda been worse
You coulda been dead
You coulda been paralyzed
Confined to a bed
You coulda lost everything
Shoulda lost everything
But somebody's watching you
And gave you another chance
It coulda been worse
You coulda been dead
You coulda been paralyzed
Confined to a bed
Coulda lost everything
Shoulda lost everything
But somebody's watching you
