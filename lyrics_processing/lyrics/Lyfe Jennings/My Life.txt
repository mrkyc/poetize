'Ight, yeah
I'll hol' at y'all tomorrow, man
'Ight, I'll talk to you
Get home safe
Crazy kids, aha, yeah
Today was a good day, word
Mmm, mmm, mmm

See I done been discriminated against (Mmm)
Talked about by my friends (Mmm)
Played a fool by women (Mmm)
And had a daddy with no feelin's
I lived in ghettos with my momma (Mmm)
Used the stove to heat our water (Mmm)
And had to share clothes with my brothers (Mmm)
Three of us, one bed, one cover, oh

And those were the happiest days of my life
If it ain't rough, it ain't right
Street lights are comin' on
Better get home, better get home
Those were the happiest days of my life
If it ain't rough, it ain't right
While we're reminiscin', Christopher Reeves
You're still Superman to me
You're still Superman to me
You're still Superman to me
You're still Superman to me, mmm
See Lyfe Jennings LiveGet tickets as low as $159You might also like
See I done been mistreated and discouraged (Mmm)
Felt like I was worthless (Mmm)
Lonely, scared and nervous (Mmm)
In a world without no purpose
Cried out to God I didn't deserve this
But he said, "In time I would" (Mmm)
See it's the bad times that make the good times feel so good (Woah, woah)

And those were the happiest days of my life
If it ain't rough, it ain't right (Ohh)
Street lights are comin' on
Better get home, better get home
Those were the happiest days of my lIfe (No, oh, my, my-my)
If it ain't rough, it ain't right
While we're reminiscin', Christopher Reeves
You're still Superman to me
I said you're still Superman to me
Noboy's gonna take your place to me
'Cause you're still, 'cause you're still Superman to me (Let's go, haha)

Yo, I done changed dirty diapers, cooked food with lighters
Shot so much game, chicks nicknamed me "Sniper"
Famous ghostwriter, bank account retired
Too many zeros, poppy still illegal
Chain look like nickels mixed with icicles
Stretchin' from the neck area to the genitals
I got a parrot on my shoulder that talk for me
And he don't say shit but, "Nigga, back off of me"
Yeah, I'm a hood nigga, but I'm still a good nigga
Bought a couple kids new bikes, just cause I could, nigga
And I ain't one who be lookin' for thanks
I just ball 'cause I like the Yanks, haha
Wow
Ten years and some odd months in the joint, and I'm-I'm-I'm finally home
I feel good, I'm lookin' good, you know I'm sayin'?
Things is different, relationships is different
A lot of my friends is dead, a lot of my friends that's alive, ain't really alive 'cause they doin' the same old thing they was doin'
Aha, ten years ago
But yo, I was on to bigger and better things, went on to New York, you know I'm sayin'?
I wasn't just talkin' about it, I was bein' about it
I wasn't just tryin' to be a better hustler, a better father, a better friend, a better cousin
I was tryna be a better person
And I found just like in the joint
When you tryna do positive things, positive results gotta follow, they gotta follow
So for the last cut on the album I thought, I'd give it to y'all, and tell my brothers in the joint whose strivin' to do the same thing
That is it possible, man, life is possible, ha
