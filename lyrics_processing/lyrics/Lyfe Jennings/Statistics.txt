If you don't know where you are this is Statistics 101
And I'm your teacher Lyfe Jennings in the flesh baby
Books out. Let's go!

25% of all men are unstable
25% of all men can't be faithful
30% of them don't mean what they say
And 10% of the remaining 20 is gay
That leaves you a 10% chance of ever finding your mate
That means you better pay attention to these words that I say
I'm gonna teach you how expose the 90%
And show you what to do to keep the other 10

Rule Number One: Don't be a booty call
If he don't respect you girl he gon forget you girl
Rule Two:
If he's in a relationship
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you
Rule Three:
Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon have to work for it
Rule Four:
Be the person you wanna find
Don't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime
