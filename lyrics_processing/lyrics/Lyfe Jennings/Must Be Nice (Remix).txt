Damn right it's nice
Wish you could get in my shoes, baby (Hmm, hmm)
It's crazy, man
A thug love letter for your foes
A thug love letter
Aha

A thug love letter written in mimosas for ink
Pen wobbles on paper, Hypnotiq the chaser
I spit the escape for prisoners of paper
Couples in trouble, good people with bad nature
Temptations, me and the queen a better team
Than Kareem and Worthy, in that new SL early
Me and Ms. Purty, happy, live through me (Yeah)
Vicariously, I made it safe for gangstas to marry (Hmm, yeah)

Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice
Havin' someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice
Havin' someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone whose smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Havin' someone who loves you despite your faults, oh no
Must be nice
Havin' someone who talks the talk, but also walks the walk
Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands that a thug has feelin's too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go, ohh

My man just came home, talkin' that "I'ma get rich" stuff
He ain't stitched up, bein' he was sent up
Inside a maximum prison, he laughin' and grinnin'
On the streets again, relaxin' with women
Asked if I've been in the Oscar awards, have I driven the most popular cars
Sitting in Maybachs with stars, "What's happening, Nas?"
I say, "I stay grounded, my paper, don't count it
Just notice I'm glowin', just watch and keep growin'"

'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone (Even when your hustlin' days, ven when your hustlin' days)
She'll be by your side still holdin' on (Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, Lyfe, congratulations on the new baby boy)
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here (Haha, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
