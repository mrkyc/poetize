Always accusing me, wanna see my phone
You say your intuition's saying that I'm doing wrong
I might as well be running around
There's only so much I can take before I just break down

Baby let's not argue, let's have a conversation
Told me the end of your station, see what song is playing
It ain't all about who right, or who is wrong
Baby this about life, and just getting along

Baby I just had a, I had an epiphany about you
You done been torn apart, you're free to give your heart
But baby let me tell you now, that all these insecurites
You're gon' wind up losing me if you keep on abusing me

Always accusing me, wanna see my phone
You say your intuition's saying that I'm doing wrong
I might as well be running around
There's only so much I can take before I just break down

Baby if there's no trust, that will never be enough
How we're supposed to be in love, if we can't keep a promise
It ain't all about the sex, it's about respect
Baby life is short, but not as short as death (Hey)
