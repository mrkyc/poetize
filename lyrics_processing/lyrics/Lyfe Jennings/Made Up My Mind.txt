Yo, this is to all y'all
Yo, this is to all y'all good church goin' people
Talkin' about folks and dont be livin' right y'all self
Y'all know who y'all is

Lord, they really think they foolin' You by comin' to church on Sunday
Prayin' and layin' hands on folks, stompin' and jumpin' around, fakin' the Holy Ghost
But it's a thin line between walkin' it and talkin' it
And livin' it and givin' it or just pretendin' it's alright
And did they really think that they could pull the wool over Your eyes, Lord?
Did they really think that by fakin', they were saved that they would get the same reward

This be the realest thing I ever wrote for sure
And after this, a lot of folks won't like me no mo'
But after this, I gotta go answer to You, Lord
So I've made up my mind, I'ma go to church on Sunday
And sing a song that may hurt somebody's feelin's so that maybe Thy will, will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven
And uh-hopefully they will see
How much they really be discouragin' a little old sinner like me

And Lord, who they think they jivin' by singin' these songs full of glory
Then out in the world it's a different story
I'm runnin' out of people to pray for me
I'm not tryin' to act like I'm the perfect man
But if you speak about it, you should be about it, not just preach about it all day
'Cause if you do, you run the risk of chasin' some of the most beautiful people away
And it is never my intention to discourage you, rather encourage you to change your life today

Hey, and then, after ten years and some odd months, ha
They finally said well, they finally lettin' a brother go, one of the happiest days of my life
And that night, I laid in my bed
And I just reminisced over, you know, all the things that happened in my life, you know?
