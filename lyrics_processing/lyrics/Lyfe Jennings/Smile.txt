Well, mmm

Feels like I'm in heaven
Rollin' my '67
Cadillac DeVille
Bumpin' that old Sugar Hill
Today, I'm livin' proof
Your worst fear came true
I'm doing alright without you baby
I'm leavin' all that darkness behind me
Makin' changes in my life
So when that sunshine finally finds me
I can stand fully in the light
Spread my wings and reach for sky
I never felt so alive
Kiss my kids good night
Tell 'em daddy's alright, I'm alright

Honey child, there's a whole world waitin' on you
Took a while but we finally made it through
Go 'head, you can smile now all that darkness behind you
Smile, smile, smile

Feels like I've been baptized
Almost drowned but I survived
She held me under for five
Years of my life
But today I'm livin' proof
Your worst fear came true
I'm doing alright without you, baby, yes I am
I'm leavin' all those grudges behind me
Throwin' fear out the window
So when these lessons come to find
They will have room to breathe and grow
Let my blessin's overflow and get my life under control
So my kids will know, daddy finally let go
I finally let go

Honey child, there's a whole world waitin' on you
Took a while but we finally made it through
Go 'head, you can smile now all that darkness behind you
Smile, smile, smile

Blue skies, blue skies are callin' you
No more teary eyes, full steam ahead now
And I don't despise you at all
I thank you for the lessons you have taught me, oh-ho, yeah
Blue skies, oh, they're clear and blue
No more teary eyes, no cryin' for you, baby
And I don't despise you at all
I thank you for the lessons you have taught me
Honey child, there's a whole world waitin' on you
Took a while but we finally made it through
Go 'head, you can smile now all that darkness behind you
Smile, smile, smile

And yo
That-I was havin' a ball
I-I gotta say, I was havin' a ball
But then, you know, I don't know, maybe she just didn't wanna see me havin' a ball, you know?
She's-she's stickin' the child support folks on me
I don't really got no money like that for all she wanted
So I mean, to basically put it nicely as possible
The lady was-feel like she was bein' kinda
