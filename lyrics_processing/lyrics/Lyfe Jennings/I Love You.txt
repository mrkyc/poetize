Nothing like having a good woman by your side, darling
Thank you thank you baby, thank you thank you baby

You are my glory
My revenge on every woman that ever ignored me
You are my baby
My BET award they never gave me
Girl you are to me, baby, what KC is to Jodeci
Oh my destination
My everyday, nothing short of amazing

I, (I love you) just wanna let you know
That I, (I love you) promise to always show it
No one loves you more
Never leave my baby for sure

Two wrongs don't make it right
But it sure makes it even
I've been loving you my whole life
Never once did it cross my mind to start cheating
You make me feel so alive
Can't on you girl, ever, take your place
You've been with it through thick and skin
I ain't going away, so get used to this face
Take a look at it baby

Now hold up, before I go
There's something I wanna let you know
I'm willing to fight for you
I'm gonna do right by you
And baby I know I make mistakes
But I'm willing to do what it takes to love you

I, (I love you) just wanna let you know
That I, (I love you) promise to always show it
No one loves you more
Never leave my baby for sure

Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
Love you, I love you, I love you
