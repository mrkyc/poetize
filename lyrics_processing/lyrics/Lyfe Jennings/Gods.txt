Your curiosities are well placed
There are things in this world that thine aren't aware of

If I didn't know better
I would say that this whole world is fake
I would say that we're stuck in the Matrix
Experiencing our own hatred
I would say that this whole world is a dream
I would say that nothing is what it seems
I would say to question everything

See, what if we were made in his image
But he wasn't who we thought he was
And what if our purpose for being here
Was just to learn how to love
And what if we were fallen angels
Sent to get back on track
And as soon as we learned how to act
We could go back

What if we were Gods
What if we weren't human
What if we were Gods
Have any confusion?
What if we were Gods
What if you and me were Gods
What if we were
What if we were
What if we were Gods

If I didn't know better
I would say the fairy tales were true
I would say that our ancestors knew
This was the only way to preserve the truth
If I didn't know better
I would say it's written in the stars
In a language that used to be ours
But somewhere on the way we just forgot

See, what if we were made in his image
But he wasn't who we thought he was
And what if our purpose for being here
Was just to learn how to love
And what if we were fallen angels
Sent to get back on track
And as soon as we learned how to act
We could go back

What if we were Gods
What if we weren't human
What if we were Gods
Have any confusion?
What if we were Gods
What if you and me were Gods
What if we were
What if we were
What if we were Gods
Do you think I've gone too far?
Do you think this feeling sometimes
Like the world seems crazy
Did you know that you're not the only one
There are some who think the same
No need to be ashamed
