Miss my Granny
No one else in the world really understands me
Emotions grab me
And I find myself on a plane to Miami
To feel that sunshine
Be close to the water, cry one more time
Sipping on Patron
All my pain, my worries, all gone!
Then my phone rings
Should I pick it up and go back to reality?
Or should I just stay
Live in my fantasies one more day?

Hmm, Hmmmmmm-mmm (And if I die tonight, it's all right)
Hmm, Hmmmmmm-mmm (I'm gonna be all right, it's all right)
Hmm, Hmmmmmm-mmm(And if I die tonight, it's all right)
Hmm, Hmmmmmm-mmm (I'm gonna be all right, it's all right)

Kissed my Granddad
No homo, just know he's so sad
Lost his best friend
And no amount of saying, "I'm sorry" is gonna help him
Feel like smokin'
Gotta get away from this heart that's broken
Drop top a-rollin'
On my way to heaven or to hell, whichever's open!
Then my phone rings
Should I pick it up and go back to reality?
Or should I not move
Bury all my sorrows in a bottle under a full moon?

Hmm, Hmmmmmm-mmm (And if I die tonight, it's all right)
Hmm, Hmmmmmm-mmm (I'm gonna be all right, it's all right)
Hmm, Hmmmmmm-mmm(And if I die tonight, it's all right)

Life is so confusing
Nothing makes sense at all
Why is this happening to me?
What am I doing wrong?
Why am I hesitating?
Everybody's telling me to be patient
Why do I feel like time is wasting?
Gotta figure out what God is saying!
