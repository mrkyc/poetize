Ain't no sense in playing, these niggas hear what I'm saying
Them diamonds on your pinky ring really ain't mean a shit to me
Voice without a purpose, you niggas could never hurt us
I feel the energy, hell of a chemistry, if I could, stop... Go

Expensive clothes with no logos
I don't even throw 1's on the floor no more
What the fuck you putting on a show for?
You don't need that attention, unless you're doing promo
Ice on the watch like this is a no no
I know what it go for, what it gotta glow for
My daddy told me have more that you show
So what if you're rich, what they gotta know for?
Never talk cheese around rats, never talk bread around bird
I chose my words
Windows tinted, they don't even know it's me in it
I don't want 'em all in my business, yeah

My number changes like every 3 months
Bitch only get to lie to me once
Let me know when the coast is clear
These niggas hustling to be seen, I'm hustling to disappear

You and me, we're not the same
Probably right now you won't understand
Just cause we live on the same planet
I'm telling you, you and me, we're not the same
You think that showing off makes you a boss
But it makes you look insecure and lost

Necklaces with one gem stone
I don't even wear it out, I tuck it in like a new born
So man ears it's like a field full of corn
So I don't say shit out the norm, no
See most of you dudes is like a clown in the corner
You used to be funny, now it's death around the corner
Sad part about it, that when the show's over
Here's the last puch line, I can't do nothin' for ya
Never tell people where I'm at
My standard reply is I'm out here checking traps
Very few friends, only got two because they're twins
And one of them owes me some M's

My number changes like every 3 months
Bitch only get to lie to me once
Let me know when the coast is clear
These niggas hustling to be seen, I'm hustling to disappear
You and me, we're not the same
Probably right now you won't understand
Just cause we live on the same planet
I'm telling you, you and me, we're not the same
You think that showing off makes you a boss
But it makes you look insecure and lost

You and me, we are, we are, we are, not the same
We are not the same
