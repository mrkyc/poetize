Aye, yo
You still up at the hood spots
Still no security
Still gotta swaga like my pops
Still water run deep when that coke is cheap
But when that price go south
Get your surf boards out
Still gotta lil pimp in me from my past
Still got some lil cousins that will beat yo ass
Yo, I'm the only dude
That you know burn the block up
So why the hell do I gotta call the cops up

Shorty, you're so amazing
Your body's banging
Conversation so stimulating
My heart is racing
I just want to know if we can get together sometime
And you know what I'm saying
Ya bodies toned up
Look at those thick thighs
Grandmama must have been feeding you right
(Shake it to the left, momma. Shake it to the right)

Somebody call the cops up
Lil mama done stole my heart
She's making me fall in love
She's not gonna give it up
Somebody call the cops up
Somebody call 911
Tell 'em I've been shot through the heart
I've fallen and I can't get up
Somebody call the cops up

Baby, the ladies staring
Fellas say hi
Champagne bottles get to poppin when you walk by
The mood is crazy
Pimping is is what pimping does
You know what I'm saying
It's two o'clock
And the club is jumpin
All eyes on you they ain't't here for nothing
(Shake it to the left, mama. Shake it to the right, mama)

Cops up, cops up
