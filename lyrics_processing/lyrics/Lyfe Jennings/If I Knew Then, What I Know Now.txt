It took my family, sanity
This wasn't part of the plan for me
People talked about me, went on without me
As if I had never existed
I guess a blessing taught me a lesson
I'll remember as long as I'm living
If I knew then what I know now, I'd be different, I would slow down
I would not be running around, if I knew then what I know now
If I knew then what I know now, I'd be different, I would slow down
As the world spins round and around, wish I knew then what I know now
I did it to myself, blamed nobody else
People warned me before it went down
I was out of control, drugs and alcohol, living lyfe like there was no tomorrow
And I'm not no superstar, times are super hard
I'm still finding my way dad to day
And I'm a man of my mind, I apologize, no one's perfect we all make mistakes
If I knew then what I know now, I'd be different, I would slow down
I would not be running around, if I knew then what I know now
If I knew then what I know now, I'd be different, I would slow down
As the world spins round and around, wish I knew then what I know now
Spent a lot of time upset, lot of things I regret
Damn it's so hard to let it go it go
They say that this gonna pass, I know but I'm still mad
It just all happen so fast, fo sho fo sho
Mommy say lyfe is prayer, daddy say lyfe ain't fair
But at least lyfe still here, ya know ya know
If I could take it back I would, if you could take it back you should
Bad times come with the good, hold on hold on
If I knew then what I know now, I'd be different, I would slow down
I would not be running around, if I knew then what I know now
If I knew then what I know now, I'd be different, I would slow down
