Ay you you, yeah you, that's holding on to that woman and has no intention of being with her. Let her go man

She wanna be your woman, you wanna be her man
But you already got somebody and she don't wanna break up your family
Seems like y'all go through this all the time, she must be out her damn mind
Cause you keep saying you're leaving her, she believes you every time
And in her heart she knows she'll never be more than your chick on the side
Though she loves you, she still got her pride, and inside

She don't wanna live like this
But she can't let you go
She shouldn't have to get like this
That just kills her more and more
She don't wanna live like this
But she can't let you go
She shouldn't have to get like this
She should be walking out the door
But she can't

She wanna make you happy, and love you all the time
But she don't know how that would make her feel
To see your little girl and look her in her eyes
And know that she's the reason why she cries
That would turn her up inside
And if you think about, it don't make sense, fucking up that young girl's life
Cause in your heart you know she'll never be more than your chick on the side
Though she love's you, she can't cross that line

She don't wanna live like this
But she can't let you go
She shouldn't have to get like this
That just kills her more and more
She don't wanna live like this
But she can't let you go
She shouldn't have to get like this
She should be walking out the door
But she can't

If you don't love her then let her go find someone that's better
Ain't no sense in holding up her progress
Love her, or leave her alone, see what it's doing to her
Can't you see what you're doing in wrong
(Right now, choose) Either you're all in or all out
(Choose), no more excuses or sneaking around
Give her what she deserves, if you can't put it in words
Repeat after me, I said you're free

She don't wanna live like this
But she can't let you go
She shouldn't have to get like this
That just kills her more and more
She don't wanna live like this
But she can't let you go
She shouldn't have to get like this
She should be walking out the door
