I done had money
And I done been broke
I done been talked about something awful
Done been lied on by so many folks
I done even been depressed at times
And didn't wanna 'cry cause my pride was too strong
But over the years I thought it over
And after strugglin' for so long and still holdin' on

If anybody says that they're that strong, they're lyin'
See cryin' is like takin' your soul through the laundromat
It's like the feelin' that you get
When you see your grandmama smile
Or the heavens open up and blessin's rain down
Go on, child, and cry
Go on and cry, cry, cry
Go on and cry, cry, cry
We can cry, we can cry together

We cry
We can cry, we can-we can cry, we can cry together, talkin' 'bout my

But I know, know, know
Fasho' sho', sho'
That even men go through problems sometime
Talkin' 'bout woah, woah, woah (Woah, woah), yeah, yeah, yeah
They say a man ain't supposed to cry (Woo, but I)
But I know, know, know (Know, know)
Fasho' sho', sho' (Yeah)
That even men go through problems sometime (I'm a man, and we cry)

Cry (Oh, oh, oh-woah)

Okay, okay
Next part of the story is that
After about five or six years in the joint, I had cried all I could cry
And then, you know, other things was comin' to me, more spiritual things was placed upon my heart
I start lookin', you know, in different places for God
