Yo, yeah, It's me
Lyfe, with the "Y"
And I'm dedicatin' this to all my brothers on the lock down
You know y'all know who y'all be
And I also wanna dedicate this to everybody who
Been somethin' for a long time
But tricked into believin' they wasn't nothin'
Ha, y'all know who yall be
For real

This ones for my peoples locked up
Know we keep you in our prayers
And ain't forgot about you out here, no
Call me whenever you feel
'Cause I know a lot of folks don't keep it real
I know they got their own life, but still
When you love someone, you let them know
You don't let them go
It's hard enough bein' alone
Missin' your family, missin' your home
Whether you're right or wrong, I'll be by your side
Keepin' your hope alive
I know how it feels to cry
So you ain't alone in your struggle for life
To my people

And your kids doin' just fine
The youngest, reminds me of you all the time
He even shoots that ugly jumper from the foul line like you do
And your girl, she doin' okay
But don't concern yourself with if she will or won't wait
You'll just drive yourself crazy with stuff you can't change
There's better ways to occupy your time
Like openin' up your mind
It's a troublin' time out here
Your kids need your guidance even from in there
And no matter when or where, I won't abandon you
'Cause that ain't what friends do
Still got a lot of love
And I pray to God through my actions you'll know how much, yeah

For all my people who ain't comin' home at all
There's many children who could learn from your experience
Have a heart, get involved
And for all my people who gon' see the streets one more time
You got another chance at life
Count your blessin's every night

Hold up, let's do this right
First, blaze one for all my fellas that ain't here with us tonight (Hold up, hold up, hmm)
