Ayo you
Ima show you how to do this son
Ima show you how to do this son

You pick me up when no one else would
You understood when no one else could
Except the things a woman never should
(Starlight stars shining bright)
I can't say I've always been faithful
But I can say I've always been grateful
They say good things are worth waiting for
(First star I've seen tonight)
Doooo, doooo, dooo (you heard that? yeah what is it?)
It's the heavens singing bringing you my love
And I can see clearly now the rain is gone
Click your Gucci heels three times cause there's no place like home, no place like home

God bless you, cause you never got brand new
This money ain't change you
Cause through it all you stayed true (Ima show you how to do this son)
And never got brand new

I know that I don't always say it
But you have been an inspiration
Your understanding and your patience
(Your voice is magical)
I know sometimes you get discouraged
And dealing with me takes some courage
But I would never hurt you on purpose
(Your feelings are valuable)
Doooo, doooo, dooo (there it is again, ha I told you)
It's the heavens singing bringing you my love
And I can see clearly now, the pain is gone
Some things you can never repay but I'll keep trying till my dying day

Waz hannin babygirl
My girl stayed down for me, always been around for me, took my word for it even when my story sound funny
I been your man since way back before I was round money
And now we all in Japan spendin' brown money
It's funny remember when we used to live in yo crib
Now cross the country we got over three or four cribs
People hate to see us ball everywhere we go
So never mind them fat broads on the radio
Slam Range Rover, Bentley and Mercedes doors
Yeah sometimes she drive me crazy she my baby though
And no I never leave, no I never go
I'm in love wit you and I will be forever more

God bless you, cause you never got brand new
This money ain't change you
Cause through it all you stayed true
