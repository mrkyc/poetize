Talking about when you
Well you know how when you break up and they go like
Oh I wish you the best and everything
No you don't
Cause if you wished me the best
You wouldn't have broke up with me in the first place man
Man I'm just so tired of cats being fake
Don't be fake with yourself man
When you break up this is what you really need
Sitting here staring in the mirror
Talking myself down
I can't believe she did this
I could kill her right now
After all we've been through
And after all this time
She was the last person I expected to cross the line
And now my world is broken to pieces
Why make promises when you never keep them
Why buy a car when you don't plan to drive it?
And why take my heart and break it with your letting go?

Girl I wish
Oh girl I wish
Nothing but bad luck
Hope you never fall in love in life
Girl I wish
Oh girl I wish
Nothing but bad luck
Hope you get hit by a truck
And die

And after all this pain
I put it on my mama, you'll never hurt me again
Well I gotta admit it
Man you had me fooled
But the same thing you did
Somebody will do to you
And you'll be wishing you never broke my heart
I can't wait to see your face when it falls apart
Why buy a car when you don't plan to drive it?
And why take my heart and break it with your letting go?

Girl I wish

And after all that pain
This broken heart is the only thing that will remain
And after all these years
After all these tears
