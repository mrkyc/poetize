Cause I was jealous cuz you favored my brother
Though we disagreed I always loved ya and
Tell my baby mama it wasn't my intention to hurt her
Hope you find someone that deserve ya
I hope there's no hard feelings
If I could rewrite one sentence of my life
I would write the words I never say
Tell you I love you every single day
See if I could somehow turn back the hands of time
I wouldn't waste a moment arguing
I'll never put you through that shit again

Cuz If tomorrow never comes
And you never see me again
I don't want yo last memories of me
To be filled with negativity
See if tomorrow never comes
All that fussing and fighting
Won't mean nothing when its said and done
If tomorrow never comes
And tell my auntie, that I was the one who broke the TV
I know that it happened in 93'
But I just had to get it off my chest, I guess
And tell my kids, that they will be especially missed
And if there's anything they should learned from this
Is life is a gift tomorrows not promised no
If I could rewrite one sentence of my life

And tell you thank you for being in my life

Cuz If tomorrow never comes
And you don't see my face again (see my face again)
I don't want yo last memories of me
To be filled with negativity

All that fussing and fighting
Won't mean nothing when its said and done
If tomorrow never comes
I take it back, I take back every mean words that I ever said
Out of anger (take it back), and every time I hurt her (take it back)
I take it back, I take back all the disagreements
All the hurt feelings, not believing in you (not believing in you)
Tell me what can I do? But apologize to you
If tomorrow never comes
My apologies (my apologies)
For if tomorrow never comes (if tomorrow never comes)
I'll make sure that I'm the one who says how much I can't
