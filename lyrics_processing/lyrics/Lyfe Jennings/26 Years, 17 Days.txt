Yo, what's up? Haha
No, my brother, not today, I'm on my way somewhere
Huh? Well, lemme-lemme tell you a lil' story, man, what happened to me not that long ago, y'all
Check this out

See I was lookin' for God at my grandmama's house
Underneath the cushions on the couch
I looked all around, side to side, up and down
That man was nowhere to be found
So I called my grandmama on the phone
Said, "Old lady, you best get home
'Cause God ain't where you said he would be
And there's somethin' that I really need to speak with him about immediately"
She said, "Boy, tell granny what's wrong, is there somethin' I can do?"
I said, "Big mama, now it's a sensitive issue
And Lord knows I don't wanna worry you
But I need somebody to talk to"

It done been twenty-six years and seventeen days
Been to five different prisons, got two babies on the way
And they say it'll be a waste of time to pray
Seein' that I'm goin' to Hell anyway

My heart hurts like an old man with high cholesterol
The preacher said that I'm the dirtiest dude he ever saw
Shouldn't even be livin', haha
And he a Christian (Haha)
Shoulda been dead like seventeen times for seventeen crimes I committed
Took 'em all to trial and got acquitted
Left wavin' my middle finger in the air whispered in the prosecutor's ear ("Yeah I did it")
I done stole everything from dreams to weddin' rings
Auctioned off my soul for material things
But lately, it's been kinda botherin' me
I guess that turtle always catches up with the rabbit eventually

Patti is amazin'
But what's even more amazin' is that
Four years later, still in prison, I was still on the road to becomin' a better person
A better father, a better son, a better-individual, all-around individual
But I saw a lotta fake things goin' on in the church
People, you know, fakin' like, you know
Uh, everybody else is bad and they-and ain't nobody holier than thou and all of that other stuff
