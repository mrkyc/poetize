Yo, ha
Y'all ain't gon' like what I'm 'bout to tell y'all, hahaha
Y'all done gave the wrong dude a deal this time, boy, hahaha
Yeah, I'ma take y'all back to how it used to be
Back in the '90s, ha, oh yeah, yeah
Yo, and he pictured everything else, now picture this

Rollin' in my two-door Monte Carlo
Lookin' for somebody I can borrow
Five or ten dollars 'til tomorrow
I'm doin' bad, y'all, mm-hmm
And I smoked my last pack of cigarettes today
You ever seen a nigga diggin' in the ashtray?
It's a crumblin' and humblin' sight to see
I'm doing bad, y'all, oh-ho

And they're teasin' me with these 23's
And these DVDs in their ride
And they pass me by, by-by-by, by-by
And have the nerve to wonder why

I be robbin' these niggas
I'm a stick-up kid
That's how I live I admit it
I be robbin' these niggas
I'm a stick-up kid
And if you're doin' too much, I'm comin' to get it
I be robbin' these niggas
I'm a stick-up kid
That's how I live I admit it
Hmm, I be robbin' these niggas
I'm a stick-up kid
And if you're doin' too much, I'm comin' to get it, mmm

See lately I've been thinkin' 'bout savin' my soul
And do prayers make it to heaven from the ghetto?
I asked all my friends, but they all say they don't know
It's all bad, y'all, mmm
And the preacher talkin' 'bout some stuff he don't know
When church done became a fuckin' fashion show
And they won't let a nigga in with these Timbos
It's all bad, y'all, oh, oh, oh

And they teasin' me with these 23's (Mmm)
And these DVDs in their ride (Oh, bum, bum, bum, bum)
And they pass me by, by-by-by, by-by

And if you're doin' too much, I'm comin' to get it, mmm
Nobody knows the trouble I see
Nobody knows but me

That only lasted briefly
You know and then, here come the police
Handcuffin' a brother off, takin' me in, throwin' me in the cage with the rest of 'em
You know, I guess it was true what mama always said
