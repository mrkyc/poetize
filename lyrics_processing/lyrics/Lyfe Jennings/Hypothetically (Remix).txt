Ayo, Fantasia
Would you wanna know?
Hm, I don't know, Lyfe

What if I broke our monogamous agreement?
What if I told you I lied but didn't mean it?
What if my one mistake had the potential to break
Up our happy home, would you wanna know?
What if I confessed it and though she didn't mean nothin'
Since it happened, you're thinking about leavin'?
What if I suppressed it?
And made a vow to never mess with another

Is it cool for me to smother the facts?
Is it cool for me to cover my tracks?
If you'd never know (If you'd never know)
Or would me not bein' honest hurt you more?

Hypothetically, of course
Are there some things better left unsaid?
Or would you wanna know instead?
Hypothetically, of course
Are there some wars not worth fightin'?
Some tears not worth cryin'?
Hypothetically, of course
What if this happened to you?
What would you want me to do?

Well, what if I told you that I had a confession?
What if I said four years ago, when we were arguin'
He came to comfort me and I wound up pregnant?
And I just can't say for sure if the baby's yours?
Now, what if I confessed it and it turns out not to be your baby
After you get tested and destroys what we've been blessed with?
What if I suppressed it?
'Cause technically, you're the baby's daddy anyway

Is it wrong for me to want you to stay?
Would you rather have me tear you away
From the only family you know?
Or is it just too big a secret to keep it on the low?

Hypothetically, of course
Are there some things better left unsaid?
Or would you wanna know instead?
Hypothetically, of course
Are there some wars not worth fightin'?
Some tears not worth cryin'?
Hypothetically, of course
What if this happened to you?
What would you want me to do?
Would you wanna know? (Would you wanna know?)
Tell me what you'd do (Tell me what you'd do)
Would you walk away or would you stay? (Would you wanna know?)
Would you wanna leave the past behind us?
Are you afraid that one day it might find us?
Would it even matter? (Would it even matter?)
Could it even matter? (Could it even matter, yeah)
Should it even matter? (Should it even matter? Oh, oh, baby-baby, baby, baby)
Hypothetically (Hypothetically)
Hypothetically, hmm (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-ho, ohh
