Skiddily beat bop we rock
Steady over kicks and snares
So what you scared for unprepared for
Tunnel rat schematics far from your average rappers new era
We rockin' sewer caps
Breathin' bricks exhale trainrail city life at its finest with
That nonsense behind us
This is how we do it
I'm just a hooligan get drunk while in a j spittin raw sewage
Splinter cell movements. turnstyle jumper
Punks step up to get beat down bumper
Alias and bright colors
So bright leave you cryin' like late night mothers
Hover board kick flips
Landin' a little to the left
As you can bet every result was a split lip
Skip school make shortcuts
Act foolish like kids with the windows on the short bus

Welcome to shellshock
Ringin' in your ears like the bells that el rock
It doesn't matter whether or not the cell locks
If you can find silence in the coldest cell block
This is shellshock
Welcome to shellshock
Ringin' in your ears like the bells that el rock
It doesn't matter whether or not the cell locks
If you can find silence in the coldest cell block
This is shellshock
Welcome to shellshock

I did it my way
Sat back and let 'em live soft
So he can die hard yippie kye yay
We exist in circles
So the first grader to push me gets boxed like girl scout cookies
This is not a test
(we don't trust you)
Not a fan of men
(that rock ugg boots)
I don't understand
(Can you blame me?)
I guess that's just the way
(Ma pop's raised me)
A penny for a thought, a nickel for a swift fist to the face
For letting them think that I let my players go to waste (no)
Top of the food chain but way too cool to not drop a little
Sarcasm in your water main
D-Did i stutter man
C-could you please make a toast for the kicker cause you know
I'm spittin' water man
Same day, new day dismantle
Same Travie time
Same Travie channel
CHORUS REPEAT X6
Yo Momma's breath smells like rusty pennies!
Yo Momma's breath smells like salamander stew
Yo Momma drink country club out of the bottle, a baby bottle
Yo Momma Smells diseased
Yo Momma got leprosy in gold nikes
Yo Momma smells like a problem Hah
BOO
Yo Momma got 6 elbows... and she got... BOOO
