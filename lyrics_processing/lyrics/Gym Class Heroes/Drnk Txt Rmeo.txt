I usually avoid any type of confrontation, conversation, in moderation
Lips sealed but my fingers are flying
And as the hours pass, they grow more impatient
My phone is magnetic, especially when I'm sauced up
And I admit that I'm ashamed
But there's Melissa, Theresa and Emily what a toss up
But that's the best part of the game
And I'm really an anonymous, aspiring alcoholic
Drowning the days pain in hops, barley and grain
Thinking of ways to convince one to join me
In the company of low-lives, sort doing the same
So I start texting, I keep texting, I can't stop, it's my obsession
It's like fish and my words are like lures
If they bought the bait cool, if not call it a night

We can't, more like we should have and I know
And I try, to be a good boy but it's hard
I start texting, I keep texting, I can't stop, it's my obsession

Now ask yourself this, is love a tender thing
Too rough, too rude, too boisterous?
Well, I'll tell you what man
I had it once and it was fun but not enough
'Tis torture and not mercy
Heaven is where my phone lives
In my pocket, so cozy oh what a joy replies give
See, Melissa's babysitting and Theresa's working late
But Emily's on her way to East 11th on the train
And that's when I remember Patty from West Philly
She said, I'm in your area, three minutes away
So I stop texting, no more texting, yeah, right, it's my obsession
It's like fish and my words are like lures
If they bought the bait cool, if not call it a night

We can't, more like we should have and I know
And I try, to be a good boy but it's hard
I start texting, I keep texting, I can't stop, it's my obsession

I know you think I'm wreckless, move so fast (slow down)
I think I love him so I told him but in a text message (uh-huh)
He wrote back, "Me too.. I was just sitting here thinking bout you"
I know I want him but I can't and I shouldn't
Tried to put my phone down, damn! But I couldn't
Stayed on the phone with him all night long
Txt Message when I'm gone

We can't, more like we should have and I know
And I try, to be a good boy but it's hard
