Ch-Ch-Ch-Children put on your angry faces
Mothers hide your daughters
I've been busy burning bridges
Hovering over troubled waters
City folk will never understand
The country mouse's jokes
They'd rather sit and watch the lemmings
Lead each other to the slaughter
This is me thanking you dearly
Sincerely, from the bottom of what's left of my misery magnet
Guess I been too busy being stagnant
And if I ever steer you wrong
Grab the wheel and jerk it left
I'm only human but admitted
I'm such a beautiful mess

With the mad hatter cackle
And the cheshire cat smile (Haha)
Put the jabberwocks cadaver
With derelict juvenile (Oh)
The futures got Travie engraved
On a name plate that I copped on fulton
While the passers poppin pills
Somewhere on the other side of Brooklyn

Baby let's ride the steel horse
Until it stops galloping
And let the nerds get revenge
On these stars with lamar's javelin

And take me to the dark side bumpin your favorite song
And I promise i'll stand still
Until the feeling is gone
And if I slip and bust it's

So I'm leaving the grocery store the other day
Probably one of the hardest things I have to do
In a regular basis, you know
With my anxiety and all
And a women walks up to me (Hey aren't you travie?)
She doesn't say hello
She just grabs me
And I can feel my heart beating harder and harder and harder
(I'm from upstate too) (Uh, cool)
I can feel the skin on my chest getting tighter and tighter
Until I just, until I just
Fucking spontaniously combust
With the mad hatter cackle
And the cheshire cat smile (Haha)

Hi, did you like the music?
I liked it
It was awesome
Hey, my favorite song was the one where the base went
"bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum"
And the guitar went "wee wee wee wee"
And the drums went "drummy drum drum drum drum drum drum drum drum
Do you remember that song?
I liked that
I want more music
Hey, have you ever wondered if a seahorse could win
A game of backgammon against an invisible wizard?
I think the invisible wizard would win
Because the seahorse does not have hands
Hey, have you ever seen an invisible wizard?
Probably not
Because it's invisible
Hey, remember that time when we were on that spaceship
And there were talking dinosaurs
And then one of the dinosaurs said:
"I cannot talk"
And I said: "You just did"
And the dinosaur didn't say anything else because
He couldn't talk?
Hey, are you listening to me?
Remember that stick of broccoli that used
To play the banjo at the annual platypus convention?
He owes me money
Hey, I'm cool
