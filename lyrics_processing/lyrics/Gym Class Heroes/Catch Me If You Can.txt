Hahaha! Yeah, you know what it is!
Upstate New York's finest, baby (Upstate berserkers in the building!)
Mad , how you feeling? You ready? I am
Let's go!

Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can (ay!)

What type of fuckery has been required lately?
It seems like these MC's heads need deflating
And imma play the pin because I've been waiting
Now make my mark on pop culture for my generation
80's babies from the age of Nintendo
Transformers, Ninja Turtles, Hungry Hippos
G.I. Joes, Phot, can't forget the clothes
Kangaroos with the zippers, had a couple those
Breaking 2 had me spinning on my elbows
Couldn't get me out my shell toes if hell froze
R.I.P JF, Jayzia, Jeraldine, Monique, Auntie Annie, Grandma Christine, Uncle Bobs, Mickey, Sharron and Tito
You know I miss you more then Shaq miss free-throws (That's a lot)
You put it back in the air, when the wee's gone
Reminiscing 'bout when we were young, but now we've grown
You might also like
Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can (ay!)

Let's talk about the scene for a minute (yes)
I know we ain't been seen in a minute (nope)
We left before a minute now we all up in it
Baby boy, if you got them big dreams, go and get it
Never been the type with tight jeans I won't fit it
When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get it
And I'm living clean now, a lotta y'all won't get it
No, it's me, but I don't give a damn if you all don't get it
So fresh and so clean, in my Eugene fitted
While I'm laughing at the baby, y'all crying at the clinic
I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I got my own, the world gotta live with it
Never played basketball, but I could show you how to pivot
Making moves in that black hatchback Honda Civic
Like I did in high school, wishin' I could relive it
But I can't, so let's go on and give the hook a revisit
Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can

Maybe I'm wrong
But after 26 years I feel I've paid my dues
So when you play this song
Just know that I live my life the way I choose
And now I stand here proudly in L.A
For a sold out crowd
And when no one's around, I refuse
To be inferior to you

Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can (ay!)
Ooh (hey!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can
Ooh (yeah!), well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam, with a ticket in my hand
Saying catch me if you can, catch, catch me if you can (ay!)

Ooh (hey!)
Ha, ha, ha, yeah
