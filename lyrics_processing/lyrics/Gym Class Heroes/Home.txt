I'm just an oxymoron in a song when I'm straight bent
Intoxicated on sobriety, irony makes sense
I'm tryin' to make a livin', you diein' to pay the rent
Why you lyin' for forgiveness, when I ain't givin' you shit?
My original plan was to live as a starvin' artist but
Starvin' artist die hungry, dress bummy
OMG, LOL, capital HEO
See a lot of 'em talk, half of 'em ain't paid
Know, truthfully I walk it out, like Dre say
Bought my car on 106, but now it's missin' like AJ
I played it smart, with a little to the side
Bought a bar in New York, where I sit and swallow my pride

I'm home and they've been missin' me since I've been gone
That's why your Mrs is been hittin' me on my phone
Little man, had a plan, now he grown, not do along for too long
Sing the song everybody
I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

I know I've been gone for too long, but I'm back, homecoming
I know y'all missed me, don't even play, I'm home now though

I'm back, your boy did it, look how he shitted on 'em
He's like hard division, consider him a problem
Subtract me from the game, now that's a bad equation
Add the fact, this industry's whack, now check your calculations
He's the equivalent of MC squared
Multiplied by eight kimbos, plain and simple
When I'm not to the nearest tenth hell, it's just a waste of time
I'm stingy, I only make sense to myself
If wealth was the truth, then it should by a man's happiness
Why the hell you think I'm smilin' so hard while I'm rappin' this
Ay Dios fuckin' Mio
The whole world got their eye balls in my keyhole
And that's why I keep the Lysol close by 'cause currency is dirty
Especially when you got it stacked miles high
They say money changed me, that's a no, no
I just don't roll with bums, no hobo

I'm home and they've been missin' me since I've been gone
That's why your Mrs is been hittin' me on my phone
Little man, had a plan, now he grown, not do along for too long
Sing the song everybody
I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

Man, Gym Class Heroes is a real problem, you need to recognize that
Y'all was actin' funny while we was gone, now we back

You tried livin' in the fast lane but couldn't reach the pedals
Now your so called life not as cool as Jared Ledos
I give this whole rap game a purple tonsil
Now that's what you get for acting hostile
You can bite the hand that feeds you, but when it bites back
You gon' get arrested development cuffs and cardiac
I'm in my prime, going harder than I should so
You little bastards takin' orders like good burger
Spittin' Snapple facts, that's nonsense
Read a couple books and you call yourself concious
The only reason I've been sleeping on music lately
'Cause y'all ain't makin' nuthin', slightly close to entertaining
But that's entertainment, this is history
If you ain't on my level, don't even get at me
Literally, I am what you have been waiting for
Gym Class is now in session, you ain't gotta wait no more
I'm home and they've been missin' me since I've been gone
That's why your Mrs is been hittin' me on my phone
Little man, had a plan, now he grown, not do along for too long
Sing the song everybody
I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home

And there you have it, Gym Class Heroes, baby
