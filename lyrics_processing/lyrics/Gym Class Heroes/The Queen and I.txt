I love it how she breathes booze in the mornin'
Man, it's so sexy how she can't remember last night
I made a fatal mistake of letting her drink again
But who the hell am I to tell her how to live her life?
And if you could put dumb in a shot glass
I'm just another lush who's had one too many in me
And please not enough
I see you stand there, settle for anything, anything's better than lettin' her
Think she could do better than me
She'll come around eventually

Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose

Oh no
She's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
You might also like
I find it funny she can never find her car keys
Immediately after telling me she can't take it
She makes the cutest faces when she screams obscenities
And slurs her words because she's never not inebriated
And the front page headline read
"Let the girl go, you know you can do better"
It's bad, when the fact that you can't have her
Is the reason you sweat her
Don't let her take advantage of you
Like the other girls let her
You better cut your losses now buddy

Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose

Oh no
She's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
Drown yourself, it's not worth keeping me
Just put it down right now and bow out gracefully
(Cause baby girl's a queen
The queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose)

Oh no
She's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
