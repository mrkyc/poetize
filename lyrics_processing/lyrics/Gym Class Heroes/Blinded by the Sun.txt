You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
If I had proof, I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

One lie, two lies, I shoulda said shoe flies
Shame on me, I usually see through lies
Said you loved me, yeah right, I thought we were air tight
You were playing foul, It was far from a fair fight
I hung onto your every word, sweetest shit I ever heard
I even made you pinky swear just so I was reassured
The rumors started gettin back, that so and so was hittin' that
Silly me for being such a 'natic for that kitty cat

You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
If I had proof, I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love but the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you to take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

Three lies, four lies, you shoulda been a tour guide
The way you led me on, knowing I was one of four guys
Said you loved me, okay, where were you the other day?
Your car was parked at 38th but you were at your mothers place?
Your mother lives on Broadway, I followed you all day
I called but you ignored it when you kissed him in the hallway
Call me crazy, call me odd, call me what you want to
But Karma is a bitch, I pray to God she always haunts you

You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
If I had proof, I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love but the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you to take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
If I had proof, I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love but the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you to take off my shades
