Let's go!

My first love was a chick from the sticks named Geneva
Had to take the 88 upstate just to see her
My mother never liked her, my father didn't either
After 22 years, I got eager and had to leave her
Now I'm realizing how much I really need her
But something told me follow my heart and head eastwards
That's when I met Brooklyn, but Brooklyn was a cheater
The second I turned my back, Jay and Weezy tag-teamed her
So I started packing, she asked me "what happened?"
Told her I was leavin' for her older sister Manhattan
Manhattan was into rap, so we started chit-chatting
And she was Chinese, Italian, Black and a quarter Latin
Super high maintenance and way too into fashion
Didn't even tell her piece and left her number on a napkin
Damn, but back then was back then
Now I heard she went Hollywood and began acting

Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh, somebody take me home
Please take me home

And after Manhattan, I was acting silly
Messing with a stick body jewel named Philly
But that didn't work out too great
I'm vegetarian and all she ate was cheese steak
I went to Baltimore for Mary and almost got married, man
But she was self-centered, always stuck in Mary Land
I knew a slim thing named Virginia
I swear to God her body's smoking, but she kept gettin thinner
And I'll never forget my first trissie
In the bins with the Carolina Twins gettin' busy
I know they miss me but I had to leave early
On the 85 doin 85 ridin' dirty
And my Georgia piece Savanna
Used to stay in Atlanta
Accent so thick, I couldn't even understand her
And that's when I realized
I damn near ran through the whole I-95

Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh, somebody take me home
Please take me home
Yeah, then I met Miami, she was spanish
Miami te amo, me llamo Travie
She could tell that I wasn't bilingual
I don't know todito, but I know un poquito
We can hit South Beach and drink mojitos
And maybe you can introduce me to your people
Ha, yo no voy pa' tra
My first love keep on calling
You no voy pa' ya
I think I finally found where imma stay
On I-95
But never forget the 88, no

Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh, somebody take me home
