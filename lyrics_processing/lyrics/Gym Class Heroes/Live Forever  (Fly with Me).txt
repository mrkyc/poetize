I see a window and all I can think about is
So do you want to fly with me? Do you want to fly with me?
I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground
So do you want to fly with me? Do you want to fly with me?

And I been staring out this window for the past eleven hours
Thinking of all the opportunities this window has to offer
From the twenty third floor and a filing cabinet east Manhattan
And FDR is beautiful as I'm watching all the cars passin'
Then a couple stars twinkle so I started laughin'
And a couple walk by and they look so happy
I booked this room at this place called The Last Resort
All my bags are packed, I got my jacket and my passport
And a first class ticket to the afterlife, you dig me?
Now is you is or is you ain't with me?
And I fully understand if you got other plans
But I can't see you hand in hand with another man
I been on auto-pilot since we last spoke
And I don't wanna board this flight on a bad note
I want you to think about it but either way I'm going
And if you really love me then here's your chance to show it
You might also like
I see a window and all I can think about is
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?
Oh, oh, I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?
Oh, oh, we'll live forever and they will write a novel about our love
(Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, oh, we'll live forever and they will write a novel about our love
(Do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
So do you wanna?

She looked me dead in the eyes and took me by the hand
Kissed me on my cheek and said, "Baby, listen I understand"
You don't have to leave, plus I'm scared of heights
So just put down your luggage, forget about this flight
You and I, you know we been through a lot of things
But it's no reason to start trippin' and arguing
She said, "You are my king, and I place no one above you"
And I don't have to board a plane for me to show I love you
And all this talk about the afterlife is kinda creepy
So let's just go lay down and talk, I'm getting kinda sleepy
I kinda smiled and we both walked to the window
I pulled it shut and started staring at the sky
I wiped a couple tears away then we looked at each other
And I could see the stars twinkle in her eyes
I told her about the couple that I saw earlier
She said, "I'm sure they were cute, but they're no you and I"

I see a window and all I can think about is
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?
Oh, oh, I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground
So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?
Oh, oh, we'll live forever and they will write a novel about our love
(Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, oh, we'll live forever and they will write a novel about our love
(Do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
So do you wanna fly with me?
(So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Do you wanna fly with me, with me, with me, with me?
(So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, oh, fly away, wanna fly away
(So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, don't think about it, just sit back and fly away
(Do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Oh, what you think is wrong is right, you gotta stand by
(So do you wanna fly with me? Do you wanna fly with me?)
Everything you know, got a reason you gotta fly, fly away
Oh, fly away
Don't worry about anything, don't worry about what the future brings, just fly
Just be here with me, just stay clear with me, oh, fly
Just stay close to me, you mean the most to me, oh, fly
Oh, don't worry, don't worry, just step back, just step away, oh
Oh, keep on doin' what you do, gonna fly, oh, oh, oh
Sing something to you, gonna change what you worry about
Don't think about it, oh, oh, just be here with me
