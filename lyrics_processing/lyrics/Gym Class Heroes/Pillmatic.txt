Pillmatic
Three xanees down
I'm pounding honey grounds
I'm pillmatic
The oxycontin got my stomach rotting
Pillmatic
I swear to God I'm not an addict
But I'm still at it, dag nabbit I'm pillmatic

Thinking back on when it all started
I found pink hearts in mommy's little pocket book
And took 'em
Popping when she wasn't looking
I guess it runs in the family
I'm liable to eat any pill you randomly hand me
Save the greenery
I'm looking for them labels reading
May cause drowsiness be careful when operating machinery
Beautiful pharmaceuticals
Residue in my cuticles
Sniffing them when its suitable
Wishing they made 'em chewable

Catch me in the source with five pills next to my name
Like fuck five mics I want five vic fame
If killing pain is the name of the game
Then I'm your number one draft pick
Dash quick to the closest medicine cabinet
Kill the whole bottle
Never played the role model position
I'm just living
So take 2 of these and call me in the morning
I'ma take 4 and finish this 40 cuz life's boring

Keep the hydro unless it's codone behind it
Never have to roam far from home to find it
Writing fake scripts like my doctor signed it
Till I spelled his last name wrong
This ain't a song for the kids like the last album
Put em to bed go ahead and turn the valium up
A couple meds to ease the pain of the papercuts
The doctor says slow down maybe later buts
40 milligrams, a 40 and im faded
This world is crazy so I stay medicated
Percaset, adavan, and colonapen
When my social lights are out
They turn them on again
I need em till I'm bored again
Oxycontin on juice on gin
Equals projectile wild style burner on a porcelain
