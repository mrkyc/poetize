Let's go

Oh, when the day is gone
Oh, when the nights are long
Life goes on
Life goes on
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on
Life goes on (Yeah)

Lately, it seems the good dreams are few and far between
Nightmares are putting fires out with gasoline (Damn)
And I'm just tryin' to stay righteous
Sometimes I see my own face in Christ's likeness (Uh-huh, yeah)
And apart from my life's vices
Fifteen years young had my first midlife crisis (Uh, uh, wow)
But it's tough to stay upright and pious
When people you hold highest be the ones that most biased (Damn)
My daddy told me misery loves company
If that's the case they must hate they ain't getting none from me
I don't sweat it, it's embedded in my DNA
I got a good heart and Bad Brains BMA

Up late Facebookin', playing could've been
And staring at an empty bed my ex-girl should've been in
Thinking what I woulda done different
Not a damn thing 'cause finally I'm done with it (I'm done)
Besides, I got a girl that adores me
And I never take for granted all things she does for me (Never)
I shoot the moon down and put it on a wedding band (*Pow*)
And sing "These Arms of Mine" to her, she's a Otis Redding fan
And she'll never forget it, man
'Cause she knows she'll never find a better man (No)
Let's go ahead with these wedding plans
Come on, let's sing a song, life goes on

Oh, when the day is gone (Day's gone)
Oh, when the nights are long (Nights are long)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (You know that life goes on, come on)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (They say that life goes on)
Yeah
We take too much for granted
Too much, we don't want an inch, we want miles
I just can't understand it
Can't understand it, is it really that hard to smile?
We don't ask, we demand it
We demand it, it's gone when it's gone
And I'm tryin' not to panic
But you know what they say, life goes on

Oh, when the day is gone (Yeah)
Oh, when the nights are long
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (Ya know that life goes on, come on)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on (Life goes on)

'Cause we won't be around too long (So beautiful)
