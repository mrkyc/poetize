She reached her hand out with a pamphlet and I politely said "No, ma'am"
I mean no disrespect and I apologize if this fucks up your program
You tell me I'm gonna burn for lying but that He can turn water to wine? (laughs)
Well if there's a hell below then we're all gonna' be just fine
So there I stood six feet of sin, a walking contradiction
But am I wrong for posing questions "or am I just another lost soul searching?"
Then she gave me a look so unchristian and told me she'd pray for my children
I said, "If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?"

Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

Now I've never been religious
I'm just a big fan of logistics
And if it makes sense then I'm all for it
I even pray if the situation calls for it
Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles
I try to answer without sounding satirical
I'm 3 years past my expiration and yet I'm still fresher than a newborn
So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say I've never seen a unicorn and I never chase rainbows
But I hear the devil wears designer clothes
So does God have a favorite brand?
And for that matter, is he even a man?
And will I go to hell for even saying that?
Only time will tell I'm just relaying facts

That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me
