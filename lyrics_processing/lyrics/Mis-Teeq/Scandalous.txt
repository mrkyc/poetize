So, so, so scandalous
You know you wanna sing with us (Yeah-eh)
That's why you know you should be scared of us (Yeah-eh)

Non-stop looks to kill
Straight talk, sex appeal
One touch gives me chills
And we ain't even close yet
Roughneck all around (Mmh yeah)
Inking all over town
Show me how you get down
'Cause we ain't even close yet

You got me feening and you got me feeling weak (Oh!)
Listen as I speak 'cause I'm careful as I creep
You got me going crazy and you know I can't sleep (Oh!)
No fortune, your moves and you hypnotize me
You got me trembling like a little baby girl (Oh!) (Mmh-mmh)
You're so special, you're like diamonds and pearls
You got me spinning and you got me in a twirl (Oh!)
You're my number one, baby, and you come to rock my world

You're dangerous, just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation, baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinning 'round like crazy
There goes my baby
You might also like
Scandalous
So scandalous (Yeah-eh)
Scandalous
So, so, so scandalous

Hot stuff, head to toe
Where you go, no one knows
You smile playing the dough
And we ain't even close yet
Solid as a rock
How many ways can you hit the spot?
Show me what you got
'Cause we ain't even close yet

You got me feening and you got me feeling weak (Oh!)
Listen as I speak 'cause I'm careful as I creep (Oh, yeah)
You got me going crazy and you know I can't sleep (Oh!)
No fortune, your moves and you hypnotize me
You got me trembling like a little baby girl (Oh!)
You're so special, you're like diamonds and pearls
You got me spinning and you got me in a twirl (Oh!)
You're my number one, baby, and you come to rock my world
You're dangerous, just get it up

Scandalous (Yeah-eh)
So scandalous
Scandalous (Yeah-eh)
So, so, so scandalous

A little conversation goes a long, long way
Show a little patience
That you are here to stay
So show me that you're game, oh ooh

You're dangerous, just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation, baby
A little conversation maybe (-sation)
You got me spinning 'round like crazy (Oh)
There goes my baby (Ooh)
