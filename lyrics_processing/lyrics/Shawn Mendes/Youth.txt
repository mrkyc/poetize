Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growin', nah
Wakin' up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep goin'

Pain, but I won't let it turn into  hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night, knowin' what's outside
Feelin' hopeless, I need focus
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no
