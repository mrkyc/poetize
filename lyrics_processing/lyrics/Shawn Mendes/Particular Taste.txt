She don't listen to a thing, 'less it feels right
Only dances when it's Kanye
She could take you one-on-one if she feels like
You'll be begging her for mercy, mercy

Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place

She's got particular taste, yeah
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah
She's so particular

Never pickin' up her phone 'less it rings twice
Only answers with a question, "Mhm?"
And if I try to play it cool, it never goes right
Got me drownin', drownin', ah

Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place
