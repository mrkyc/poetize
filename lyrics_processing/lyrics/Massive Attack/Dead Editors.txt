Conveying my
My swaying tide
Conveying my
That swaying time

Tapestry
I see tapestry
I see tapestry
Golden tapestry
Flashing light years, flashing light years
What would it take to get back to the blackness?
Up there, out there
When we gonna be like stars?
Constellations in installations of my fixation of so sensational, oh
What would it take to know?
In the beauty of the night sky
Taking a peep at the history
Messages in the mystery
Further to what the eye may see
Eye to eye with these reasonings
More to gain from believing in
Beyond the Lord, now we leave it in
Watching you wave that dependency
Who, the wheres, and the whyfor
'Cause to live or to die for
We all search for some kind of truth
Hurt will make it inclined to be
Type the type for self righteous
Cool and pure with no hype, just
Black it before and behind us
Nature might remind us
Fear for fear but where time lives
Secretly in those eyelids
All for one with one iris
Black it before and behind us
Nature might remind us
Fear for fear but where time lives
Secretly in those eyelids
All for one but one iris

Flashing right here
Flashing light years
Dancing upon these timelines
Knowing that the time lies
Before and ahead of us
Lose your head then head it up
Just now we get perspective
Deep love for the unexpected
That special request is
Made for the sole investments
The bank upon these fortunes
That just can't be exhausted
Those infinite resources
Where you just don't need to force it
The work is where the force is
The transport for sport lives
Amongst and beyond it
The seekers and the finders
Sure as death can find us
One inside the tapestry
Flashing light years
Flashing light years
