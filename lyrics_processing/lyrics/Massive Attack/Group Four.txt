A flask I drink of sober tea
While relay cameras monitor me
And the buzz surrounds, it does
Buzz surrounds, buzz surrounds

Closed eyed sky wide open
Unlimited girl, unlimited sigh
Elsewhere, indefinite, far away
Magnifies and deepens

Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
And listening
Keeps me from my hurt
My ears know that my eyes are closed
Perished thoughts like contraband

I train myself in martial arts
As advertised
I reinforce my softened parts
As advertised

See through me, little glazed lane
A world in myself

Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
Flickering, I roam
And listening
My ears know that my eyes are closed
Ready to sing
My sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath
Flickering, I roam
And listening
My ears know that my eyes are closed

I see to bolts, put key to locks
No boats or rocks, I'm free to roam
On dummy screens and magazines

Closed eyed sky wide open
Unlimited girl, unlimited sigh

Think that I lay next to you
Wasting time when I could do
A simple job in strip lights
A flask I drink of sober tea
Till daylight sends me home
Flickering, I roam
Daydreaming, admiring, being
Quietly, open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky
Turning over at midnight
See through me, little glazed lane
A world in myself
Daydreaming, admiring, being
Quietly, open the world
I hear the time of the starry sky
