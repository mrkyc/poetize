We've been here before, don't fear me
Don't stand by the door, come near me
We've been here before, don't fear me
Don't stand by the door, come near me

Quick thought, left or right
Could it be a strong case of fight or flight?
We'd never know you're slightly overworked and self-conscious
Sweating beads of doubt
This can't be right, whisperin' out, "This can't be right, right?"
This ain't like on TV
Pretty for an aftershave
I'm scared life will leave me
Strung out, in need of love
Surely I'm as overcome but brimstone won't come to lungs

But I ain't done, surely I ain't done
Oh, nah, nah, I ain't done
Oh, but my mind's on the run

Caused by your never-ending dream
And it ain't what it seems
Ain't what it seems
Know what I mean?

We've been here before, don't fear me
Don't stand by the door, come near me
We've been here before, don't fear me
Don't stand by the door, come near me

Monster on the bed, regurgitating out
Mad, this monkey on my back
Pulling hair like puppet strings, slow to react
Tell me, what's the matter, love?
Life's drive slow-mo
Front crawl in Speedos
Fight against the rising tide
Breathe deep, never stop clawing at the light
Clinging on to what we got

But I ain't done, I ain't done
Surely, surely, surely we must overcome
But my mind's on the run
My mind's on the run

Caused by your never-ending dream
Nah, and it ain't what it seems
It ain't what it seems
Baby girl, it ain't what it seems
Nah, it ain't what it seems
Too cruel to be mean
To be cruel
Don't wanna lose ya
We've been here before, don't fear me
Don't stand by the door, come near me
We've been here before, don't fear me
