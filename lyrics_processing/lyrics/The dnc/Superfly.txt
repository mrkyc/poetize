I said I'm superfly

I'm superfly, yeah the world is mine
It's aviation time, and all I do is fly
Don't even touch the ground, I walk on clouds
I said I'm superfly
I'm superfly, yeah the world is mine
It's aviation time, and all I do is fly
Don't even touch the ground, I walk on clouds
I said I'm superfly

Hey, kid, be superfly
Runnin' 'round town in a suit and tie
Hey yo, baby, just do or die
I'mma keep my aim, I'mma shoot the sky
I get it, I get it, I see
Mad with yourself, so you hatin' on me
It's hard to say no, we're on a movement
Came in Range Rovers, we all be cruisin'
See I got jetpacks for the setbacks
Waitin' in cloud 9 for the damn time
No datin', pound sign after pound sign
'Bout to blow like a landmine on my down time
Don't it sound fine, don't it sound fine, baby, don't it sound fine?
Take a look for yourself, all around, ah

I'm superfly, yeah, the world is mine
It's aviation time, and all I do is fly
Don't even touch the ground, I walk on clouds
I said I'm superfly, I said I'm superfly

Yes, I'm a little bit faster
Ain't slowin' down, so pump it louder
I'm king of my world, king of my castle
And the rest just doesn't matter
I've got the power, no switch
Flow like magic, they say they love me
Got my eye on the sky, spread my wings and I fly high, high, high, high
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got it, I'm 'bout it, I run it

I'm superfly, yeah the world is mine
It's aviation time, and all I do is fly
Don't even touch the ground, I walk on clouds
I said I'm superfly

I'm gone, I don't know about you
Had one but I'm goin' round two
Got friends, tell 'em they can roll through
Tryin'a turn this spot to the Moulin Rouge
See the paintin' on the wall right there
See the carpet in the hall right there
Didn't I tell you we're gonna ball this year
Got my money lookin' tall this year
Two seats in the coupe
H on the belt and suede on the roof
Lookin' back now, you could say I made a killin'
Ridin' 'round town, top down, what a feelin'
I just spend whatever on whatever, tell 'em bill it
All the worries up your
Now messin' with the realest, I told 'em I'm-
I'm superfly, yeah the world is mine
It's aviation time, and all I do is fly
Don't even touch the ground, I walk on clouds
I said I'm superfly

Ah, just wanna shoot the sky
I said I'm superfly, I'm superfly
