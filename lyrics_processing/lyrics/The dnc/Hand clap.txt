My feet left right
She 360 from the waist down
Hands up clap sound like surround sound
Minus will be belly dancing
Eye contact like, like two romancing
Intense dancing
Music got ya hands clapping
Body's moving souls grooving
If ain't off the wall on the dance floor then ya loosen
If ya shy get to the bar get to boozing
Dancing like ya in the mirror
Or ya at home joking with ya friends
Tonight ain't fun unless ya sweating till ya slim
And ya hands up clapping like you need a encore for more
