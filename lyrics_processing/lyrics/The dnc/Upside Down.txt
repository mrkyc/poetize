My world is turned around and I'm upside down like
Oh, oh, right outta nowhere
My feet are up off the ground and I'm upside down now
All of a sudden the bottom floor is the top floor
The top floor beneath my feet and man it feels so low
Everything's changin'
This situation's
Takin' me on a ride
All over, around, now
Chasing me down
And I got no place to hide, hide
If everyone could walk my world, my way, then I'd be
The king of that world, no one would
Dare to knock on my door bothering me
I'm feeling the speed
Feeling this heat H-E-A-T
Inevitable
It's outta control
Turning me inside out and upside down
Oh, no, what's goin' on here
My world is turned around and I'm upside down like
Oh, oh, right outta nowhere
My feet are up off the ground and I'm upside down now
Knocked down, right down, down, down, down
Smacked down, right down, down, down, down
Man down, man down, down, down, down
So turn around, right down, down, down
You might also likeMy world's flipped inside & out, I've been in a cloud, but now
Instead of livin' it up, I'm livin' it down
Looked as a clown, the frown I've caused
See assume you're the king then do a few things
Don't think there's a price to pay
Look at me now
I've been in a cage and put my life on delay
With nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, I'm out of disguises
Rules to abide
I thought I could fly, smacked the ground
Everything's steady been crashin' down
I had it all, but all was never enough
And if u haven't learned your lesson, you just never been cuffed
Oh, no, what's goin' on here
My world is turned around and I'm upside down like
Oh, oh, right outta nowhere
My feet are up off the ground and I'm upside down now
Knocked down, right down, down, down, down
Smacked down, right down, down, down, down
Man down, man down, down, down, down
So turn around, right down, down, down
Hey, it's too much for me to handle
So turned around up in a scandal
Hey, caught in a mess I can't undo
Woah, what happened to me can happen to you
Oh, no, what's goin' on here
My world is turned around and I'm upside down like
Oh, oh, right outta nowhere
My feet are up off the ground and I'm upside down now
Knocked down, right down, down, down, down
Smacked down, right down, down, down, down
Man down, man down, down, down, down
