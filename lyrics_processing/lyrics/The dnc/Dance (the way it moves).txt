Hypnotized while I'm on the floor
Something like a trance, got me gone
Dangerous is the way it moves
You turn my night life on
Girl stay until the morn
That's how far we can go
Once you and I alone
Feel my body
How you touch me
Come on show me how bad you want me
Got you in a trance, so appealing
I know you like it
Let it sink in
We flirting, no romance
You want more than a glance
My body on your mind
You want me bad tonight
I love it, I love it, I love it
Love it, love it
Lets dance
I love it, I love it, I love it
Dance
Got me floating, got me gone
Hypnotized while I'm on the floor
Something like a trance, got me gone
Dangerous is the way it moves
It's something like a trance, it makes me wanna dance
We moving in the light, while dancing through the night
Time to let go
Moving in circles
Got her in my arms and we spinning
Something like a trance, so appealing
Like the feeling
Let it sink in
We flirting, no romance
She wants more than a glance
Her body' s in my mind
I want her bad tonight
Got me floating, got me gone
Hypnotized while I'm on the floor
Something like a trance, got me gone
Dangerous is the way it moves
Bridge
It takes me, takes me away
No I don't wanna stay
Lets get gone, can't you hear it calling
Calling, for you, for me
It's you and I
Where are we
Don't know
But I like it
Don't fight it
I know you like it
It's addictive
So seductive
Make you surrender
With your hands up
Now you floating
Move with it now
