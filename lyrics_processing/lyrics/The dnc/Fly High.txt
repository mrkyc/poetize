It's all mentally, they saying it can't be done
I say light like a feather then i lift it off
She saying that kind of thing only happens in movies
Am like, wait and see best believe Ima do it

Don't think i'll ever stop, wouldn't even know where to begin
I burn it from the core and take it around, around around the world (hey!)
