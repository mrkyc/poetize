Verse 1:
Am having the best of days
Ain't got no bills today
I'd like to make a toast
It goes to everybody that is managing this
This day can't get no better
Feels like the summer weather
I got some extra cash I love my visa card
Should I maybe shop me this, should I maybe shop me that
It's all so easy to choose, I think I'll take me both
If you don't do this for you
Nobody is gon do this for ya
So come on now let it spin and sing it oohlala
Chorus: x2
Feeling good, yes I am, I got it oohlala
Am so chill, am so fresh, am so coolala
If you got it, sing it out loud oohlala
Woohoo, woohoo wowo wowo oohlala
