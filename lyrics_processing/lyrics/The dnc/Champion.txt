I gotta seize this moment
Own it, hold it, hold on baby ill be right back
You won't be disappointed, when it gets lonely

I'll make you proud, i'll make it work, i give you my word
You already got me baby, i'mma give you the world
I know its hard, i need you strong
Said close you eyes, and just let

Let's Go yeah i'mma be your champion

So lets go
Let's Go yeah i'mma be your champion

One step away from greatness, success is what you make it
Little voice inside my head, said there is a chance you should take it
The kids i grew up with, telling me i made it
As i stand on this mountain, look at all my haters faces
They say it all came too fast, well lets trade places
Its more to the story man, its more to the pages
I do it cause i love it and losing is outdated
Now look at this problem, that you created
