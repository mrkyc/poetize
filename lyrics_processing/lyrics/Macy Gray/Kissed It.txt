Every day my mind is cloudy
Got enough tears to fill the sea
They say that I'm a drag
Tell me, I be lookin' sad
And nobody wants to party with me
And it's because of you, the shitty things you do
The low ways that you treat me
Endlessly
I was gonna leave you till you kissed it (Kissed it)
I wanted to leave you, then you kissed it (Kissed it)
I was gonna leave you, then you dipped it (Dipped it)
Baby, you fixed it (Fixed it) when you kissed it (Kissed it)
I don't wanna fight, baby
Kiss it (Kiss it) 'cause I miss it (Miss it)
Make it alright (Alright)
Boy, you light a fire in me
Ooh, you treat me like a dog
Tell me all I do is wrong
Treat me like I wear a training bra
You push my love away
Then you come to save the day
Then the next thing I be seein' ya
