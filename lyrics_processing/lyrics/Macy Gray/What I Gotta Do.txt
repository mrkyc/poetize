Yeah, Girl a boy and a girl
Never thought I'd have babies
Looking up to me
Wanna give them all the world
Yeah, trying to make it, always gone
You say, mommy don't go, ooh ooh
And I don't wanna leave, uh uh (I don't wanna leave)
It's what I gotta do
There's no place that I'd rather be than there with you
It's what I gotta do to take care of you
Make it right, ooh (make it right, make it right)
And I never make it
But I have to hope you understand the circumstances
I'll be there the second I get the chance
What I gotta do
Yeah, only you can rely
Wanna give you the best of everything
So I miss some things
But you're always on my mind (always on my mind)
Yeah, I'm gonna show you the world
But it ain't easy, ooh ooh
But I don't wanna leave you (I don't wanna leave)
