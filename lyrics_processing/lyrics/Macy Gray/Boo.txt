Like a talk show he's got drama everyday
Lots of rage and mental abusing
The way he treats me it's obvious he's confusing
Me for some dumb bitch
Who will stick around
I tend to stick around
You
Tell me that you love me if it's true
Why am i runnin from you and who
Are these bitches on my answering machine
Yeah you, you tell me that you love me but boo
If this is love
It's a good thing you don't hate me
Superfly
Someone who'll at least try
Who'll smoke me out from time to time
And love me all nite
Tell me everything about him
And none of it turns out to be lies
Easy
Rainbows
These words come to mind
And he loves me all nite

If this is love
Its a good thing you dont hate me
Never settle for the things that you dont really want
Cause all it gets you is a big ol piece of unhappiness
Happiness could be mine but its so hard to talk to you

Hold me close
Cause im the most and
Make a toast to you and me
See thats the way loves supposed to be
Not stressful...alright
