Who you been, where you been, what you been
And I can't decide on your roller coaster ride
Or your merry-go-round, take me 'round and 'round
And I'm waiting
While you're breaking away
And if I had it to do over, I'd see you again
I'd do it right, and when we fight, I'd let you win
'Cause my world is nearly nothing without you in it
Should've let it go, could've let it go, could let you win
I get a taste of the summer sun
Every time you walk into my door
Yeah, we laugh and we tease, yeah, you're so easy
But I ain't satisfied 'til I make you cry
And I'm shaking
While you're breaking away
And if I had it to do over, I'd see you again
I'd do it right, and when we fight, I'd let you win
'Cause my world is nearly nothing without you in it
Should've let it go, could've let it go, could let you win

Oh, baby, yeah, baby
You think you're right, baby, most of the time
Oh, babe, yeah, baby
There's no way, no how I can heal without you now
You are so real, yeah, that I'm going into town
Putting my hands up
But I need you now
And if I had it to do over, I'd see you again
I'd do it right, and when we fight, I'd let you win
'Cause my world is nearly nothing without you in it
Should've let it go, could've let it go, could let you win
Let you win, let you win
Let you win, let you win, let you win
Let you win, I give in
