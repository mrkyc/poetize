Everybody wants my baby
Every baby wants me
We both drive each other crazy
With jeala-jealousy
(Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy)

Every time that we go out why you wanna bring me down?
Screamin' 'bout how I'm lookin' round
At other dudes, while I'm dancin' with you
And every time that you come home
Every time you get on the phone
I've got twenty-one questions and
Who you talkin' to, where you been?
Baby, baby...

Everybody wants my baby
Every baby wants me
We both drive each other crazy
With jeala-jealousy
(Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy)
Everybody talkin' lately
But we all know talk is cheap
We both drive each other crazy
With jeala-jealousy
(Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy)
