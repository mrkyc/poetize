But life don't let up for us
All they talk about is
What is going down?
Whats been messed up for us?
When I look around I see blue skies
I see butterflies for us
Listen to the sound and lose it
Its sweet music and dance with me
There is beauty in the world
So much beauty in the world
Always beauty in the world
So much beauty in the world
Shake your booty boys and girls for the beauty in the world
Pick your diamond pick your pearl there is beauty in the world
All together now
We need more lovin'
We need more money, they say
Change is gonna come
Like the weather
They say forever
They say
When they're in between
Notice the blue skies
Notice the butterflies
Notice me
