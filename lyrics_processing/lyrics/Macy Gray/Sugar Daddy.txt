Be my, be my sugar daddy
And provide me with your candy
I will be your sugar, sugar baby
If you'll be my sugar, sugar daddy, sugar, sugar daddy

I think I need a taste, I've been a good girl
Come give me, give me some
'Cause I've been here waiting for you, for you
Why don't you come through? (Why don't you come through?)
My caramel lollipop, my Hershey Kisses
My favorite candy shop
That's what I'm missing is you, is you
Why don't you come through? (Why don't you come through?)

They try to tell me to stop (to stop), but I want it
I can't give it up (give it up) 'cause I love it
And why should I when there's so many tasty flavors?
All I'm tryna ask you is to

Be my, be my sugar daddy
And provide me with your candy (oh, baby)
I will be your sugar, sugar baby
If you'll be my sugar, sugar daddy, sugar, sugar daddy
Be my, be my sugar daddy
And provide me with your candy
I will be your sugar, sugar baby
If you'll be my sugar, sugar daddy, sugar, sugar daddy
