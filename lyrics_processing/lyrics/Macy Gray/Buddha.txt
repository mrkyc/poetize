If it's what you feel, my advice is that you show it
So baby cry, if you hide, how will I know it?
And I pray every night that my dreams come true
Will I finally be happy if they do?
Hurry, hurry up, my days are numbered

This is what I feel when I stand in the sun
And I think of all the bad that I've done
And I'm looking ahead, and I'm looking back
And I realize it's where I'm at
Hurry, hurry up, my days are numbered, yeah

But I'm alright now
(I'm alright, I am, I'm alright)
Yes I'm alright now
(I'm alright, I am, I'm alright)
Yeah our future is in the air, and the past is in the ground
But I'm alright now
(I'm alright, I am, I'm alright)

It's what you know, it's what you don't, you watch the news
And very soon you're amazed and confused
So you put on your cape to save the world
But it's a big and a cold and a shady world
Hurry, hurry up, our days are numbered, yeah
