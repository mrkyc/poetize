Cold like in my isolation cell in the winter while kissing Mr. Freeze
Take the weather man and blow him away
Hey hey, love is a desert and I need it to rain
You are so good at keeping me company
You are relating to a psychopath
Your role model is in therapy
You must be real far gone
You are relating to a psychopath
Noah's elephants are leaving the ark in eights
During the upside of my manic depressive state
Crickets sing in three part harmony
I try to walk away, I choke and I stumble
I'm flying back, so listen close when mumble
That you are so good at keeping me company
CHORUS
You are relating to a psychopath
Your role model is therapy
You must be real far gone
You are relating to a psychopath
It never adds up when you do your math
You are relating to a psychopath

You are relating to a psychopath
Medication is slow
And it's when it kicks in that mind chooses to go
My feel better begins
Just when I get attached
It ends
It's insane
So I rather remain a psycho
1,2,3,4
Cartoon figures dance in my head
I said, love is butter, won't you be my bread?
And you are so good at keeping me company
CHORUS
You are relating to a psychopath
Your role model is in therapy
You must be real far gone
You're relating to a psychopath
It never adds up when you do your math
You're relating to a psychopath
Yes I'm real far gone
You're relating to a psychopath
Oh a psychopath
I am demented
My mind is bendin'
My brain is twisted
Psychopath
You must be a psycho too
Love is butter, won't you be my bread?
That's what I said
Psychotic
Psychosis
My manic depressive state is great
On the upside
It's the love side
Love is a desert and I need it to rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain
Love is butter, won't you be my bread?
