So just let it roll, I'm just warming up, yeah

So, I haven't had a drink since my last one
No clouds in the sky but I'm on one
(I'm alright, feeling alright)
I'm alright
Cupid shot me in the heart with an AK
I'm on a ride, I'm on a high, I'm on a play date
(I'm alright, feeling alright)
I'm alright, oh yeah

(Pick up, I'm calling, calling
Catch me, I'm falling, falling
I didn't know it but I know it now)

Didn't know it but I know it now
There's an angel living in my house
It's the only thing that could explain what I've been going through
I'm on fire over you

I wasn't looking but I've found me a real one
Give it to me or I'm gonna have to steal some
(I'm alright, feeling alright)
I'm alright
Whose bumps? Whose bumps in my head?
I'm gonna get you alone, baby, in my bed
(I'm alright, feeling alright)
I'm alright, I'm feeling alright

Didn't know it but I know it now
There's an angel living in my house
It's the only thing that could explain what I've been going through
I'm on fire over you
I've been reaching for the stars
I've been wearing my lucky charm
It's the only thing that could explain what I've been going through
I'm on fire over you
I'm wearing, I'm wearing my lucky charm

There are castles in my sand
I got a horn section in my band
You see, baby
There's a skip up in my step when I'm walking down the avenue
All because, baby, I love you

Didn't know it but I know it now
There's an angel living in my house
It's the only thing that could explain what I've been going through
I'm on fire over you
I've been reaching for the stars
I've been wearing my lucky charm
It's the only thing that could explain what I've been going through
I'm on fire over you
I'm wearing, I'm wearing my lucky charm
