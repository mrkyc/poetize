Just a fine young man with big dreams
Trying to make his own way
The owner is this mean ole bitch who degrades him everyday
Then she fires him for no reason
Don't wanna give him his last pay
I said "I've committed murder and I think I've got away"
I'm hiding at my mother's house come get me right away, right away
I have no intention of paying for my crimes, don't fear
We're gonna get the next plane outta here and fly away, fly away
When he's down it breaks my heart to see him
So I figured I'd talk to her woman to woman
I walk in and she's countin' her cash
Got so much cash her office looks like a green pasture
I said "give him the little bit of money you owe him"
She said "get back bitch I ain't givin' you shit"
I said "you ole bag, maybe you ain't heard but them are fightin' words"
I've committed murder and I think I got away
I'm hiding at my mothers house come get me right away, right away
I have no intention of paying for my crime, don't fear
We're gonna get the next plane outta here and fly away, fly away
I've committed murder and I think I got away
I'm hiding at my mothers house come get me right away, right away
I have no intention of paying for my crime, don't fear
We're gonna get the next plane outta here and fly away, fly away

See baby, there was this struggle
And I don't feel bad about it
And as a result of this struggle
And I don't feel bad about it
But the good thing is, is that
And I don't feel bad about it
We don't have to struggle no more
With a suitcase full of money
We flew to a Jamaican paradise
One thing I've learned through all of this is
Having money sure is nice
Me and my baby got married
He's working hard to make his dreams come true
As far as regrets I don't have any
Would you?
I've committed murder and I think I got away
I'm hiding at my mother's house come get me right away, right away
I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear
We're gonna get the next plane outta here and fly away, fly away
I've committed murder and I think I got away
Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote
Murder she wrote
I've committed murder and I think I got away
I'm hiding at my mother's house come get me right away, right away
I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear
