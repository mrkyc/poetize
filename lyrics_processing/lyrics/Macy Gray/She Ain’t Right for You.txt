Wrote me in a letter
That she makes you feel better
And all of the things you said to her
But I feel what I feel
It's real

She ain't right for you
She don't know you like I do
No matter what she do
She ain't right for you
Don't you wanna be happy?
Baby, you should stay with me
'Cause she ain't right for you
She don't love you like I do

Turn me around
Turn me upside down
Sporting the tears of a clown
But I feel what I feel
It's real

She ain't right for you
She don't know you like I do
No matter what she do
She ain't right for you
Don't you wanna be happy?
Baby, you should stay with me
'Cause she ain't right for you
She don't love you like I do

They will say that I spend all my days
Chasing a love that she took away
But I feel what I feel
You know, baby, I've been trying to tell you for a mighty long time
That you can keep looking, you can keep searching all over the world
Trying to find a love like mine, but the real thing is right here, baby
And no matter what she say, no matter what she do
She don't love you like I do

She ain't right for you
She don't know you like I do
No matter what she do
She ain't right for you
Don't you wanna be happy?
Baby, you should stay with me
'Cause she ain't right for you (Stay with me)
She don't love you like I do

Oh, stay
Oh now now, I spend all my days
Chasing a love that she took away
