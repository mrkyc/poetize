When there come and left for dead
I've been out of my head
And now I wanna be bigger
Being here with you
It's not so hard to be
I can see my dreams
I know I'm gonna be better
My friends always say

My friends always say
That everything will be okay
But it don't always, work out that way
So here I am again
Believing in, 'cause I remember when
Baby

I had the time of my life
Everything is right with you
After all that I've been through
I ain't trying to lose
This time of my life, with you
Baby

People say I'm out of line
So much on my mind
Like I wanna be bigger
Sometimes it don't rhyme
But when you're here with me
I have poetry
I know I'm gonna be better
And my friends always say

My friends always say
That everything will be okay
But it don't always, work out that way
So here I am again
Believing in, 'cause I remember when
Baby

I had the time of my life
Everything is right with you
After all that I've been through
I ain't trying to lose
This time of my life, with you
Baby
One day they will see
The giant in me
Finally see me smile
Hear me laughing, out loud
My voice will be heard
It's no longer absurd
And I hope you hear
'Cause, baby, baby
I had...

I had the time of my life
Everything is right with you
After all that I've been through
I ain't trying to lose
Motivate my mood and groove
And do everything I can

I had the time of my life
Time of my life, with you
Baby, take my hand
Because I wanna hold on to
This time of my life, with you
Baby
I had the time of my life
