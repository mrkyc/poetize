You can't just lay around, all summer long
Your school days are gone
What's gonna make you wanna make it on your own

So he took a square of paper
That he cut out of the Avery Evening News

Until he saw her face
He finally found a reason
To wake up early, every morning
Get his feet on the ground and get downtown
To be there right on time
'Cause he knows that she'll be waiting
She'll be working down the aisle
And he'd do anything
To see that small-town angel smile
Turns out, all he ever really needed was a reason

And studies late into the night

She'll be working down the aisle
And he'd do anything
To see that small-town angel smile
Turns out, all he ever really needed was a reason

And that's just what he does
All because of her
You see he's finally found a reason
To wake up early, Saturday morning
Put his feet on the ground and go downtown
Gonna get there right on time
'Cause he knows that she'll be waiting
Her daddy will walk her down the aisle
And he'll promise God
He'll always make that small-town angel smile
Turns out, all he ever really needed
