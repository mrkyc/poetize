Sleeping underneath that Texas sky
Keep them doggies movin' on
From Santa Fe to San Antone. Living in the south until you die
Move on to Sunday crowds and rodeos, stetson hats and fancy clothes
Girls who love to dance all night long
Bob Wills, Z.Z.Top and Jerry Jeff and Janis Joplin
Hear that Lone Star soul in their song
Say

Come on down, we'd love to see ya, open arms are there to greet you
Just remember-
There's a way that things are done ...
If you kill someone you're gonna fry
On Willie's bus you're gettin high
That's your lesson in Texas 101
Well, the girls are pretty and th trucks are bigger
Cause of oil, some folks got richer
You can't drive across her in a day
They got Tex-Mex food and senoritas, Bar-B-Q and margaritas
Once you get a taste, you're gonna stay

Come on down, we'd love to see ya, open arms are there to greet you
Just remember-
There's a way that things are done ...
If you kill someone you're gonna fry
On Willie's bus you're gettin high
That's your lesson in Texas 101

They got George Bush and Dixie Chicks
Guess oil and water just don't mix
But, there's one thing on which they might agree...
If there were no Alamo
Then Texas would be Mexico
Where in the name Sam Houston would we be?

Come on down, we'd love to see ya, open arms are there to greet you
Just remember-
There's a way that things are done ...
If you kill someone you're gonna fry
On Willie's bus you're gettin high
That's your lesson in Texas 101
(awww, play it agian , ya'll)

Come on down, we'd love to see ya, open arms are there to greet you
Just remember-
There's a way that things are done ...
If you kill someone you're gonna fry
On Willie's bus you're gettin high

That's your
