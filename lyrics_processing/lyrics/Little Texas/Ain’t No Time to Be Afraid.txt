(Track 3 - Time 4:00)
I was scared half to death
I couldn't catch my breath
'Cause that old tree down by the river
Was thirty feet high
That's when I heard my daddy's voice
He said son you've got a choice
You can climb down now
Or you can fly
This ain't no time to be afraid
Or look the other way
If your prayers have all been prayed
Then you just let it come what may
If you're not brave enough to try
Then life will pass you by
All we have is today
There ain't no time to be afraid
At the altar my best man
Said since I am your friend
It's my job to inform you
It's not to late run
She was comin' down the aisle
All I could do was smile
I whispered no my friend
I'm sure I found the one
You might also likeThis ain't no time to be afraid
Or look the other way
If your prayers have all been prayed
Then you just let it come what may
If you're not brave enough to try
Love will pass you by
All we have is today
There ain't no time to be afraid
Keep your faith when you're out there all alone
When you're faced with your fears just walk on
I was scared half to death
'Till he took his first breath
He was kickin' and a screamin'
Lord I loved that sound
With a house way too small
A stack of bills too tall
I thought only one thing really matters now
This ain't no time to be afraid
Or look the other way
If your prayers have all been prayed
Then you just let it come what may
If you're not brave enough to try
Life will pass you by
From the cradle to the grave
There ain't no time to be afraid
All we have is today
