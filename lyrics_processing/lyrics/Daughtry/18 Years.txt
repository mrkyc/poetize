Sat down with an old friend
Like time had never stopped
From the cradle to the coffin
We'd drink until we drop
Yeah, we grew up on the same street
Small town under the hill, yeah
Where dreams get lost and buried down
Deep inside the saw mill, yeah

And all day, all night
Keep pressin' rewind
All day, all night
I remember
All day, all night
Keep pressing rewind
All day, all night
I remember

We were young, we were wild
We were halfway free
We were kids on the run
On a dead-end street
Looking back in the rear-view mirror
You know the view used to be much clearer
But we'll laugh and we'll cry
Till there's no more tears
Yeah, tonight can we just hold on to those 18 years
18 years

Some ran down the highway
To chase away their ghosts
Some are frozen in the same place
This town inside their bones
Remember throwin' TV's off the overpass onto the tracks, yeah
But the trains roll on through them small town and never look back, yeah

And all day, all night
Keep pressin' rewind
All day, all night
I remember
And all day, all night
Keep pressin' rewind
All day
Tell me, do you remember?

We were young, we were wild
We were halfway free
We were kids on the run
On a dead-end street
Looking back in the rear-view mirror
You know the view used to be much clearer
But we'll laugh and we'll cry
Till there's no more tears
Yeah, tonight can we just hold on to those 18 years

On those 18 years
Yeah, we just hold on
Yeah, we just hold on
Yeah, we just hold on
18 years
18 years, yeah

We were young, we were wild
We were halfway free
We were kids on the run
On a dead-end street
We were building a bridge
Out of broken dreams
We were crashing like cars
When we were 18
We were young, we were wild
We were halfway free
We were kids on the run
On a dead-end street
Looking back in the rear-view mirror
You know the view used to be much clearer
But we'll laugh and we'll cry
Till there's no more tears
Yeah, tonight can we just hold on to those 18 years?
18 years

Can we just hold on

To those 18 years
Can we just hold on
Can we just hold on
