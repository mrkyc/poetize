I lost, I was lingering in the dark
Hard times, don't you know we've seen them all
Ain't one to preach
Ain't one to speak on what I don't know
I lay that burden down
With one hand, reaching for the sky
And one hand, holding on for life
I won't raise my, I won't raise my white flag in this life

The moment I surrender, bury me in the ground
I'd die before you see me take a bow
You know we all got, you know we all got, you know we all got a lot to lose
I won't surrender, pray the lord my soul to take
Thank God I live to die another day
You know we all got, you know we all got, you know we all got a lot to lose
I won't raise my white flag, 'till I'm through

I found, my way following a trail of hurt
'Cause my name, ain't no stranger to the dirt
It's been dragged around, it's been kicked around
They left it lyin' there for dead, whoa
But I defy, before I lose the right
And take the time, to watch the river rise
I won't raise my, I won't raise my white flag in this life
In this life
