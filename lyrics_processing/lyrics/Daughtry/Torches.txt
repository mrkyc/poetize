All the hate and lies around us
Like an ember in the brush
And can you picture a world without it?
And turn it all to ash and dust

We keep waiting on a day that never comes and never comes
Too late is not a thing and we just gotta be stronger
Oh, gotta be stronger

Love is like a torch that's burning bright
Carry it on, carry it on and you'll see
Fire will shine a light on the darkest side
Carry it on, carry it on
Cause we can never right all the wrongs
So leave the past well enough alone
And say

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

We keep waiting on a day that never comes and never comes
Too late is not a thing and we just gotta be strong

Love is like a torch that's burning bright
