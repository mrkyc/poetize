There's a place where you can light the fire and watch it burn
Lay it down and lose it all
It's taken me so far beyond the point of no return
Gave all that I had when hope is gone
(Hope is gone)
Is this real, or is it just another crazy dream
That someday soon will fade away
Feels just like I'm underwater and can barely breathe
Dying in the bed that I have made

I don't wanna drown in you
I'm sinking, then I'm torn in two
So when you see me come up for air
Don't try to hold me down
Just save me now
Don't let me drown in you
(Don't let me drown in you)

The city pulls me in closer than I've ever been
There ain't no way I can escape
Without a doubt, you know
That I would tread the deepest end
Thousand years forever in a day

Did I bring this on myself, can I get out alive
Yeah, I've given you the best of me
Now you want the rest of me
What's it gonna take to survive, yeah

There's a place where you can light the fire and watch it burn

I don't wanna drown in you

I'm sinking, then I'm torn in two

Don't let me drown in you
Drown in you
