Well, I'm doing alright
'Til I close my eyes
And then I see your face
And it's no surprise

Just like you said I would, yeah
I swallowed my pride, now I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
Down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
Just like that, like you said I'd do
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you

Time can heal, but the scars only hide the way you feel
And it's hard to forget how I left you hangin'

Then I see your face and it's hard to fake it

Just like that, I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would, yeah
I swallowed my pride, now I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
Down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
Just like that, like you said I'd do
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you
