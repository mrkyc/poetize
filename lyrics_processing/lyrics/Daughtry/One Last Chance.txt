Tell me what you need
And I will find a way to stop the bleeding
No, don't add to my mistakes
Tell me you're not leaving
Then I'll tell you everything you need to know
Don't throw it all away, don't say my words are just too late

I don't wanna be left behind
I've been so blind to all that I have broken
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they don't exist
Just me out in the open
I know this will take time
Can you give me one last chance to make it right?

You say the story's ending
Ut I think it's time we stop pretending
No, can't let you turn the page
Does your heart remember
When we used to say forever? Don't let go
Don't throw it all away, don't say these words are just too late

I don't wanna be left behind
I've been so blind to all that I have broken
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they don't exist
Just me out in the open, I know this will take time

I don't wanna be left behind
I've been so blind to all that I have broken
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they don't exist

Give me one last chance to make it right
