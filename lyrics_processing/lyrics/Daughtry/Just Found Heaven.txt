Gone all my life
Worried about my soul
Brimstone and fire, stories I've been told
Then I saw grace, right before my eyes
I should break through those gates, and fall from the sky

I hate to let you down, hate to let you down, no
Hate to say it now, hate to say it now
But

I don't really care where I go when I die
Cause I just found heaven
You can tell the devil that's he's wasting his time though
Cause I just found heaven
Singin' Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah
Singin' Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Sins wash away
Dark tuns to light
Your body is a temple so take me inside, oh
I feel no pain, pleasures all mine
You give me a taste of eternal life, oh
