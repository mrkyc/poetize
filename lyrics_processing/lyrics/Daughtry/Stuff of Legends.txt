I live days, alone and afraid
With my devils, how I wrestle them
I spent hours staring at the walls
I heard angels sing Hallelujah

I'm tired of waiting for the ship to come
And being told that it can't be done
Gon' go ahead and give me some
Gon' go ahead and give me some (Oh oh)
Won't let 'em get to me (No)
Won't let 'em get to me (No)
Get to me
Get to me
I'm gonna

Fight with mercy (I'm gonna), love and anger (I'm gonna)
They won't get to me, get to me
'Cause that's the stuff of legends
All my power (I'm gonna), live life louder (I'm gonna)
They won't get to me, get to me
'Cause that's the stuff of legends

Walk that walk, feelin' like a boss
Flip that blue switch, turn them lights on
