I open my lungs
To breathe in forgiveness and love
Haunting me now, reminders of how I used to be
And on down the road, my troubles are sure to follow
Looking out the window the hell if I know where I will go
So I'll just keep on driving

On my way to L.A
Looking into the rear view as the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned so this can all end tonight
Tennessee line (Tennessee line) just changed my mind
Well, it's my heart I'll follow this time

Who would've known (Who would've known?) that pride is so hard to swallow?
As I rest on the shoulder of a road growing colder
With the trouble I own, should I just keep on driving?

On my way to L.A
Looking into the rear view as the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned so this can all end tonight
Tennessee line (Tennessee line) just changed my mind
Well, it's my heart I'll follow this time
See Daughtry LiveGet tickets as low as $85You might also like
I know I must be doing something right
Head the other way, back to where I started out
Ask myself if I can turn it all around tonight
And stop living with doubt
Yeah, yeah

On my way to L.A
Looking into the rear view as the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned so this can all end tonight
Tennessee line (Tennessee line) just changed my mind
Well, it's my heart I'll follow this time

I've sworn off my past
First to last bad call that I ever made
It's my heart I'll follow this time
I've sworn off my past
(Oh, yeah)
First to last bad call that I ever made
I'm going to turn it all around tonight
Turn it all around tonight (Around tonight)
Turn it all around tonight
I'm going to turn it all around tonight
