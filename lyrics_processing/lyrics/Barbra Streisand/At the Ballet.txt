I really need this job

Not more than I do. Believe me. Hi, I'm Shelia. What's your name?

Bebe. And this is Maggie

Hi, Maggie

Hi

Hi

Gosh, there's a lot of people here

Yeah, it's a cattle call

But you'll get the job for sure, Maggie. You're so pretty

Haha! Oh believe me looks are overrated. Just a different set of problems

Okay ladies. Line up. We'll start with you. You. Number 24

My name is Sheila. What do you wanna know?

Why don't you tell me why you're in this business?

I wanted to be a ballet dancer. What else? The light, by the way, is a very funny color. Do you have anything softer?

Don't--don't worry about the lights

It's very harsh

So tell me, do you always come on like this?

No. Sometimes I'm aggressive

Just--just bring it down

Bring what down?

Your attitude, miss

It's Sheila

Okay, Sheila. Why don't you tell me about your parents

My parents?

Yeah

Well, my mother was a ballerina until my father made her quit
Really?

Really

Tell me more

Tell you more?

Daddy always thought that he married beneath him
That's what he said, that's what he said
When he proposed he informed my mother
He was probably her very last chance
And though she was twenty-two
Though she was twenty-two
Though she was twenty-two
She married him
Life with my dad wasn't ever a picnic
More like a "come as you are."
When I was five I remember my mother
Dug earrings out of the car
I knew they weren't hers, but it wasn't
Something you'd want to discuss
He wasn't warm
Well, not to her
Well, not to us
Come to think of it
But
Everything was beautiful at the ballet
Graceful men lift lovely girls in white
Yes
Everything was beautiful at ballet
Hey!
I was happy at the ballet
That's when I started class

Up a steep and very narrow stairway
To the voice like a metronome
Up a steep and very narrow stairway

It wasn't paradise

It wasn't paradise

It wasn't paradise

But it was home

Okay Number Eighteen

I'm Bebe, sir

And what's your story?

I don't know what you mean

Okay. On the subject of mothers what about yours?

My mother?

Yes, yours

She lied to me

She lied to you?

Mother always said I'd be very attractive
When I grew up, when I grew up
"Diff'rent," she said, "With a special something
And a very, very personal flair."
And though I was eight or nine
Though I was eight or nine
Though I was eight or nine
I hated her
Now
"Diff'rent" is nice, but it sure isn't pretty
"Pretty" is what it's about
I never met anyone who was "diff'rent"
Who couldn't figure that out
So beautiful I'd never live to see
But it was clear
If not to her
Well then to me

That everyone is beautiful at the ballet
Every prince has got to have his swan

Yes

Everyone is beautiful at the ballet
Hey!

I was pretty
At the ballet

Up a steep and very narrow stairway
To the voice like a metronome
Up a steep and very narrow stairway

It wasn't paradise

It wasn't paradise

It wasn't paradise

But it was home

Alright, Number Six

Number Six that's me, Maggie. Can I tell you about my parents?
I don't know what they were for or against, really, except each other
I mean, I was born to save their marriage
But when my father came to pick my mother up at the hospital he said
"Well, I thought this was going to help
But I guess it's not."
Anyway, I did have a fantastic fantasy life
I used to dance around the living room with my arms up like this
My fantasy was that it was an Indian Chief
And he'd say to me
"Maggie, do you wanna dance?"
And I'd say, "Daddy, I would love to dance."

But it was clear
When he proposed
That I was born to help their marriage and when

That's what he said

That's what she said

I used to dance around the living room

He wasn't warm

Not to her
("Do-do-doo's")

It was an Indian chief and he'd say
"Maggie, do you wanna dance?"
And I said, "Daddy, I would love to"

Everything was beautiful at the ballet
Raise your arms and someone's always there
Everything was beautiful at the ballet

At the ballet

At the ballet!
Yes everything was beautiful at the ballet
Hey!

I was pretty

I was happy

"I would love to."

At the ballet

God, I hope I get this job

Yeah? Me, too

What about me?
