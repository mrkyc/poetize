Call on Dolly!
If your neighbor needs a new romance
Just name that kind of man your sister wants
And she'll snatch them up
Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts and
She'll match 'em up
Call on
Missus Dolly!

She's the one the spinsters recommend
She even find a lovely bride
Call on Dolly!

I have always been a woman who arranges things
For the pleasure--and the profit--it derives
I have always been a woman who arranges things
Like furniture and daffodils and lives

For a rather modest fee

Just leave everything to me

( Where to, Dolly?
 Yonkers, New York, to handle a highly personal matter for
Mr. Horace Vandergelder, the well-known, unmarried, half-a-millionaire
 Gonna marry him yourself, Dolly?
 Why, Mr. Sullivan, whatever put such a preposterous idea into my head--your head!)

Just leave everything to me
If you want your liver tested, glasses made, cash invested:
Just leave everything to me

I'll discretely use my own discretion
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
