Will you welcome, please, The Oreos?

The Black, Black Widow is sitting in the middle
Of the web, it's the fly she seeks
You may be her lover, but you never will recover
'Cause she ain't had a bite for weeks
You think you're the same 'cause you got the same name
But the widow has a mobile home
Remember what I told you, she got eight arms to hold you
And she's never gonna let you roam

She'll tuck you into bed, truck on your head
Then she'll wrap you as a midnight snack
So if you see a spider, don't you saddle up beside her
Why do you think the widow's wearing black?
Jack (Ow)

The queen bee, baby
Pray that you may be left on your own
Uh-huh
Nothing she'll give you, gonna outlive you
Ah-ah-ah, but the queen bee's never gonna be alone
Uh-huh

Long before Atlantis, there has been a praying mantis
And you know why he's on his knees
He may have religion, but he's just a sitting pigeon
If a woman even starts to tease
He won't even quibble if she has a little nibble on his neck
What a way to go
Now you've gone and torn it, you've been messing with a hornet
She's a blue-blooded wasp, you know

And just as you do it, she'll inject you with a fluid
That you ain't even got but none
You're meat on the plate, not even first-rate
She's gonna feed you to her seventh son

Just like a queen bee, baby
Pray that you may be left on your own
Nothing she'll give you, gonna outlive you
Ah-ah-ah, but the queen bee's never gonna be alone
Uh-huh, uh-huh

So in conclusion, it's an optical illusion
If you think that we're the weaker race
Men got the muscle, but the ladies got the hustle
And the truth is staring in your face
The mother bear stalks and the queen of the hawks
Is the one who brings home the bread
The lion that is regal and the bald-headed eagle
Need a woman just to keep 'em fed
But come the evening, we're like Adam and his Eve
Inside the garden, hear the serpent's sound
It's so frustrating when you're really into mating
And there ain't a loving man around
Whoever wrote the story (It's so frustrating when you're really into mating)
(And there ain't a loving man around)
Throw out the glory, bring in the men (It's so frustrating when you're really into mating)
(And there ain't a loving man around)

Give me them and I'll swing
Write me a sequel, give me an equal
Ah-ah-ah, and I'll give that man (Oh, yes, I will)
I said I'm gonna give that loving man (Ooh)
I said I'm gonna give that loving man (Alright)
I said I'm gonna give him that loving sting
