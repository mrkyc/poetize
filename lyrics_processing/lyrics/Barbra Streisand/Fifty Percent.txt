Hello?

Hi

Hi. You're not gonna have to wait for me this time I'm all packed

Honey, I can't go

What, what happened?

I forgot that I promised the kids I would take them to their game. They want their mom to go too

Oh, of course, I understand
It's their mother and you can't disappoint your kids

We'll go next weekend
 Okay, great
You might also like
Next weekend for sure, I promise you

Next weekend for sure

Do you still love me?

Of course I still love you

Oh I miss you

I miss you too

I'll try and call you

Okay. Bye honey

Bye
I don't iron his shirts
I don't open his mail
I don't know all the jokes he tells
Or the songs he hums
Though I may hold him all through the night
He may not be here when the morning comes
I don't pick out his ties
I don't butter his toast
But I feel when he's in my arms
He's where he wants to be
We have no memories
Bittersweet with time
And I doubt if he'll spend New Year's Eve with me
I don't share his name
I don't wear his ring
There's no piece of paper saying that he's mine
But he says he loves me, and I believe it's true
Doesn't that make someone belong to you
So I don't share his name
So I don't wear his ring
There's no piece of paper saying that he's mine
But he says he loves me
And I believe it's true
Doesn't that make someone belong to you?
So I don't share his name
So I don't wear his ring
There's no piece of paper saying that he's mine
But we both have the memories
I have enough memories
I've washed enough mornings
I've dried enough evenings
I've had enough birthdays to know what I want
Like there's anyone's guess
It's a constant surprise
Though you don't plan to fall in love
When you fall you fall
And I'd rather have fifty percent of him
Or any percent of him
