Just lies to steal your mind
Now I know that you're thinking
That I'm running out of time
Sister must'a missed you
I don't wanna steal your shine
There's method to my madness
Yeah there's reason to my rhyme
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
So soul sucking vampire
How you love to steal the vibe
All wrapped up in your addiction
So we'll have to say bye bye
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Oh, you're so hip, this sour mood on our trip x2
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
You might also likeIs this your own reflection, you keep it in a safe
There's a secret combination, to naval gaze all day
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Yeah you say you love John Lennon, you don't want the world as one
By all means necessary, yes I have to sing my song
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Oh, you're so hip, this sour mood on our trip x2
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Ad lib during solo about it being a beautiful thing
And come on can you feel it
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
It's a beautiful thing that I say bye bye
Hear me, It's a beautiful thing so I stay so high
Hey it's a beautiful thing
