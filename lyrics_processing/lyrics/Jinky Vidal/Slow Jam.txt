I was all alone
I was feelin rather low
I needed someone to, lift my spirits up
So I dropped in on a dance, just to take a glance
And there this lovely thing was, she was more than enough
I asked her for her hand
Said would you like to dance?
So pleased that I had asked, she quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love, on a slow jam....Ohhhhhh
(Chorus)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
On a slow jam, for my baby and, me yeah
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
On a slow jam, for my baby and for me yeah
(Monica)
Seems what you say is true, I feel the same way too
See I've waited all night long, just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand, I knew you were the man
To turn my world around, and make my, dreams come true
The magic in your eyes, made me realize
That everything I feel, has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love, on a slow jam
(Chorus)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
On a slow jam, for me and, my baby yeah
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
On a slow jam, for my baby and for me yeah
(Usher)
Ive been tryna find someone who
I could give my good lovin to
Never ever did I dream I'd find someone..yeah
(Monica)
I've been trying to find someone too
I prayed to heaven, and then I found you
(Usher and Monica)
I swear I fell in love the night you....danced into my heart
You might also like(Chorus)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
On a slow jam, Can I get a get a slow jam
Do you want a slow jam?
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
On a slow jam, Can I get a slow slow jam?
Play another slow jam
Are you gonna slow jam?
