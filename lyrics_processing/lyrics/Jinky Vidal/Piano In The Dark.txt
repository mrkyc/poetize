I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now?
I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotions here
It's pullin' me back
(Just a little more back)
Back to love you
Oh no, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays the melody
Born to tear me all apart
Silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotions here
It's pullin' me back
(Just a little more back)
Back to love you
Oh no, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
*music plays*
Silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh
Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotions here
It's pullin' me back
(Just a little more back)
Back to love you
Oh no, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little, oh i cry i cry
Oh no, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
