As performed by Jefferson Airplane
In a little rockumentary called "Gimme Shelter"
About the Rolling Stones and their nightmare at Altimont
That night
The Oakland Chapter of the Hell's Angels had their way
Tonight
It's my turn!
When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you died
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
And don't take no for an answer
When the garden flowers
They are dead, yes
And your mind
Your mind is the full of red, yeah
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
I'd really like somebody to love
But it's hard to find somebody to love
You might also likeYour eyes
I say your eyes they look like his
Yeah
But in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it is
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't, don't, don't
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
Don't take the green acid
That's for the bass player
Sh D-dow
Sh D-dow
Ha ha ha!
Yeeeaaaahhh!
Tears are running
Running down your breast
And your friends, baby
They treat you like a guest, yeah
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
I would really like somebody to love
But it's hard to find somebody to love
We just had a baby born
In the left side of the party
Ladies and gentlemen
We need an ambulance by the scaffolding!
Oh, my little baby!!
Hey, get off the stage
Get off the stage, man!
All right!
Unless you have a pass
You are an audience member
You do not have access to this area
Wow!
That guy just got stabbed
Do you see that?
I think we're getting a little outta hand here
Wow!
Who hired the security on this gig, man?
They are a motorcycle gang!
