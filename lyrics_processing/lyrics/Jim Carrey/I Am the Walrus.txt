I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a corn flake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm cryin'
Cryin' (get out of myself)

Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

(We're all just molecules bouncing around)
Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get your tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob, goo goo goo g'joob

Expert, texpert choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you (ho ho ho, hee hee hee, hah hah hah)
See how they smile, pigs in a sty, see how they snide
I'm de-heh-heh-heh-heh
Semolina Pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower (get down from there!)
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

I am the egg man
They are the egg man
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob, goo goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob, goo goo goo g'joob, goo
Goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joo-hoo-hoo-b
Goo goo g'joo-hoo-hoo-b

Everybody's got one (repeat until end)
There, I did it!
I defiled a timeless piece of art!
