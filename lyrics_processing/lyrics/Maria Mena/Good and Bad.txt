(Both, good and bad)

The one who screams the loudest
Whoever holds the torch (both good and bad)
Owns the room, captures the audience
Gets the attention, both good and bad (both good and bad)

I'm never claimed to be flawless
I owned up to my faults
Yours were subtle painful betrayal
But I see what you did, both good and bad

There's two sides to our story
And mine gets all the fame
I frolic in the glory
And buckle in the shame

I see what I did, I see what you did
I see what we did, both good and bad
I see what I did, I see what you did
I see what we did, both good and bad
Good and bad

We're both in pain, we're mourning
Something that once made sense (both good and bad)
And it it's tempting to distribute blame
But let's see what we did, both good and bad

I really tried my hardest
I did the best I could
With what I knew then, I know better now
Cause I see what I did, both good and bad

There's two sides to our story
And mine gets all the fame
I frolic in the glory
And buckle in the shame

I see what I did, I see what you did
I see what we did, both good and bad
I see what I did, I see what you did
I see what we did, both good and bad
Good and bad

We're both in pain, we're mourning
Something that once made sense
And it it's tempting to distribute blame
But let's see what we did, both good and bad
There's two sides to our story
And mine gets all the fame
I frolic in the glory
And buckle in the shame

I see what I did, I see what you did
I see what we did, both good and bad
I see what I did, I see what you did
I see what we did, both good and bad
