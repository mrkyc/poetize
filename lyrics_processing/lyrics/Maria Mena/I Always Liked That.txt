After all that I've preached I still cannot accept that I'm not a fit
And once led off course the snow ball snow balling down my spine
Draws a imperfectly imperfect line
Is it just the weight cause the weight is what weighs me down again
Or is that the scapegoat, the overly clumsy friend
There to take on the blame for what's really happening
The circle must come to an end
And I always liked that about me
That I know what I am fighting for
And for this I'd go to war
Weapon in mind is my mind's skin
Swaddled around the only body part that should matter, my heart
The only way is to let go
Get rid of all the fear
Of not being perfect
My goal seems perfectly clear
I'm terrified if I let go I also lose myself
And I don't want to be somebody else
And I always liked that about me
That I know what I am fighting for
And for this I'd go to war
Weapon in mind is my mind's skin
Swaddled around the only body part that should matter, my heart

That I know what I am fighting for
And for this I'd go to war
Weapon in mind is my mind's skin
Swaddled around the only body part that should matter, my heart
What if I've always been good enough in my skin
Good enough in my skin
What if I've always been good enough in my skin
Good enough in my skin
And I always liked that about me
That I know what I am fighting for
And for this I'd go to war
