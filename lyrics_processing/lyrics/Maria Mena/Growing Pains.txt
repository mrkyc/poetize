No one will tell you 'bout the limit
They put on how long you can grieve
No one will warn you when you're winning
How heavy a lost love can be
They do not tell you 'bout the friendships
You'll lose once the lights are dimmed down
How humble you'll feel about your past bliss
Once the tables have turned 'round

But I wanna tell you I got through
The hardest of times on my own
I made some mistakes, I made a few
But I learned that I am strong

And just because it hurts
Doesn't mean it isn't worth it
And even if it stings, mmm
It's just a temporary thing
I'm not saying that changing
Won't cost you love, won't make you cry
But it will all make sense, mmm
When the growing pains subside

Nothing can shield you from the silence
Nights spent on his side of the bed
Praying for help to please stop crying
My life just got turned on its head
They failed to explain how complex love is
Like why I mostly miss him as a friend
Or how big of a blow is for my ego
That she might be better for him

But I wanna tell you I got through
The hardest of times on my own
I made some mistakes, I made a few
But I learned that I am strong

And just because it hurts
Doesn't mean it isn't worth it
And even if it stings, mmm
It's just a temporary thing
And no one said that changing
Won't cost you love, won't make you cry
But it will all make sense, mmm
When the growing pains subside
And just because it hurts
Doesn't mean it isn't worth it
And even if it stings, mmm
It's just a temporary thing
And no one said that changing
Won't cost you love, won't make you cry
But it will all make sense, mmm
