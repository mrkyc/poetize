Uh
Make me see blurry
Take away my worries
Yeah

You got me singin' like lavender
I can never stay mad at her
Lavender, I can never stay mad, mad, mad
Baby, we're a mess, but it's all okay
Reverse stress, when you call my name
Like lavender, I can never stay mad at her

Dropped out, teach me how to love, it's a classroom
Hot for the teacher, with a question, I gotta ask you
Girl, what's the move?
Late night Malibu, yeah
You know what you do
Got me breakin' all my rules, yeah

She a bad thing, she my boo (She my boo)
On my better side, anything she do
She a sweet thing, that perfume
Purple everything, got me in a mood
(Hol' up)

Oh my, oh my, I'm in love
She got everything I want
She my butterfly, my honey bee (Woo, yeah)
She my lemon, she my apple treat (Sour and sweet)
For no reason (for no reason), I be cheesin' (I be cheesin')
She look me in the eyes and I can't breathe in
Exhale all this pain I been feelin' (I been feelin')
When I sing, baby girl, I hope you feel it (Ah)
