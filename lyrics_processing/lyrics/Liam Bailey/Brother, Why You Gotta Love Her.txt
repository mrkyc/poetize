I'm tired of feeling alone all night long, she's not there
Tired of feeling confused by the fear
Don't know where she's comin' from, I know the lover's hands
Is there more to be seen? Am I blind to the secrets?
Oh yeah

What does it take? (You don't need to call)
Is there more to love? (And there's no need to fall)
She got a hold of a part of my soul and she can't get enough (When you call and you fall)
She been movin' strange (And you don't need to call)
And I'm not to blame (And there's no need to fall)
I'll admit to my part of the war but it's all a game (When you call and you fall)

Brother, brother, brother, ooh
I told her I believe her this time
Why you gotta love her, love her, love her? ooh
I don't wanna be this guy
Brother, brother, brother, ooh
Before you tell me again I'm gon' be walkin' away
Why you gotta love her, love her, love her? ooh
Although I like the chase

Oh I, and I thought you would see the fire
And the warnings and, oh I
You gotta walk out to see more
Don't let her break you and, oh I
Don't believe in the thin of it all
'Cause she's deceivin' and sinnin' the same
And why you keep on forgivin' her?
Forgivin' her?

Instead of cheating, I just had to break up, oh
It's hard to tell you but you have to find out
