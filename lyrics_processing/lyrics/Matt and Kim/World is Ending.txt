The world, the world is ending, we'll run away together
Please tell me what you want from me
I gave it all I got and the world is ending
You worry about everything
But wash it all away cause the world is ending
Told me there is no more laughs
All the jokes been told time and a half now
Maybe I'm just as bad as you
Just as bad as you, even worse than you, yeah
The sun is getting brighter now
Past the SPF, can't turn it down
Warning shots went unheard
We were too turned up, we were too turned up
There is so many fish in the sea
But only a few that really know me now
Together we will go down
In a blaze of glory, in a blaze of glory
The world, the world is ending, watch the sky fall on us
The world, the world is ending, we'll run away together
The world, the world is ending, watch the sky fall on us
The world, the world is ending, we'll run away together

The selfie is alive and growing stronger
We wanted to see the world
So open up your eyes, take a look around you
Can't explain it from the start
But stories get better as stories fall apart, yeah
I know it's all a lie, but is it all a lie?
I know I can't decide now
Doesn't matter who had won
The team broke up with the only ones
I lost along the way
The trophy that doesn't even say my name
Flights delayed, bills never paid
Promises made all forgotten
As it piles up we'll climb on top
Won't make us stop, won't make us stop
Won't make us stop...
The world, the world is ending, watch the sky fall on us
The world, the world is ending, we'll run away together
The world, the world is ending, watch the sky fall on us
