'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone

(I don't pick 'em up either )

We all stop mighty on buck chasers
On ice to price Christen till they duct tape you
Domain name is three w dot decay runner
Dot com twice around the block
We inhabit the habit of the rap life
So we got the main lady in the rap wife
Who keep us out on the road to unload the style
That said to be ahead of a tick tack
That leaves me with the same little issue
Hey, how you doing, sorry, that I missed you
Leave your words after the tone
While I lay around trying to recover
Acting like I'm too old for this shit like D. Glover
But then right on a case, with Dave and Mase
I earned a place for what I made right midnight
My roar to roll with these broads 'cause in the daylight
You might also like
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone

Yo, sing a simple song, I'ma simplify it for you
Tell them, what they need to hear, darling I adore you
Rinse my balls in the rays of Osiris
Captain of the hook brought a rap to play the pirates
Two ships passing, one without anchor
Couldn't find the landline even if she pantomime
Slope broke faced the ships on the table
Dip's in the fridge if the chips on the table
Hips in the big, if the chips on the stable got the
Horsey that she rode in
It's the exit I'ma ask to put your coat in
Smoke your numbers like Jimi on a guitar, arc on a sitar
As far as I can see it I'm vampire, baby
I dial in the dark where a lonely dog barks until somebody throw a shoe at him
The new phantom of the operator
Connect me to my baby girl

'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
Yo, off the gun, we off on the run
Zoom past blocks like we being chased by cops
On fences we don't sit and we don't quit never
Forever in the echo chain
Must be the checks one-two, in the night livin' it up fast
But still catch the checks one-two
And don't forget the three, 'cause that be the magic number
From the tops of NY down under

'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
