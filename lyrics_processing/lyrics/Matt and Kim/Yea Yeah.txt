Forget your court date
Lock me away, the world waits
Cuffs cut deep to the bones
We're trying to sleep, we're trying to sleep
I have these hands (Woah-oh-oh)
Can't turn back time
And time can be a game and we're losing this one
But still I'm sane

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

You stole tapes and a flashlight
On a summer night from my car
I found something in a lightning storm
With heavy rain and thunder like mountain stone, yeah
When everything seems to wash away
I walked in with just two feet on the ground, ground, ground, ground, ground!

Lock me up, officer
What mistake I made
Yeah yeah, take me away
I said this to myself
Close the door on myself
Yeah yeah, take me away
I found something in a lightning storm
With heavy rain and thunder like mountain stone, yeah
When everything seems to wash away
I walked in with just two feet on the ground, no, no, no, no!
