I was up in my head for everything I said
Quote a million words, they're all made of lead
I bought a megaphone to use inside your home
Forgot the batteries, but that's the old me

Shouting out of my windows
Rolled down
Cause I don't care anymore
Said, "I don't care"
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh
Ooh-woo, ooh-woo, ooh-woo-ooh, ooh-woo-ooh
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

I'm standing on the top of a parking lot
I gave it all I had, show me what you got
There's some things I've found that makes so much sound
All these words, I don't need 'em now

Shouting out of my windows
Rolled down
Cause I don't care anymore
Said, "I don't care"
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

Say what you wanna say
Make it mean, everything
Oh say what you wanna say
Make it mean, everything
Say what you wanna say
Make it mean, everything
Oh say what you wanna say
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

Ooh, ooh ooh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ooh, ooh ooh (Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Ooh, ooh ooh (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ooh, ooh ooh (Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Say what you wanna say (Ooh)
Make it mean, everything (Ooh, ooh)
Oh say what you wanna say (Ooh)
Make it mean, everything (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Say what you wanna say (Ooh)
Make it mean, everything (Ooh, ooh)
Oh say what you wanna say (Ooh)
