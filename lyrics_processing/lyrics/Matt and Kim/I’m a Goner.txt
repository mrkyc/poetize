I feel so high like I'm on a plane
Like I'm on Cloud 9 and I'm makin' it rain
Black shoes, black shirt, black hat
Black diamonds, black everything, I brought black back
Black Franck Muller, tell a hater top that
I'm so out of here, you can't stop that
That's just a fact, I can't feel my face
I'm so outer space, I'm so in a daze

Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, you've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Come with me, I'm a goner
Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, you've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Life's too short to wait any longer

Oh, I'm a goner, can't you see?
Started shallow, going deep
Oh, I'm a goner, can't you see?
Singing six feet beneath
And I'm a goner, bit by bit
Bed's too thin, I'm over it
A chalk-drawn picture while you sleep
I said I'm a goner, can't you see?
You might also like
I said I'm a goner, you better not look for me
I'm a goner, I'm long gone, now boy I'm tellin' you
I'm a goner, you're never ever gonna find me, oh
I'm a goner, I'm long gone so sing that song

Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, you've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Come with me, I'm a goner
Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, you've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Life's too short to wait any longer

You already know
This for the fans, history in the making
I'm a goner

I'll be there any minute, don't you wait for me
Believe me, I'm a goner, it's too late for me
Take me out my shoes, no replacing me
It's okay, I'm living two lives, no saving me
Oh oh (Oh oh)
I said oh oh (Oh oh)
I said oh-oh oh-oh (Oh-oh oh-oh)
Oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh-oh

Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, you've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Come with me, I'm a goner
Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, you've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Life's too short to wait any longer
Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, you've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
Come with me, I'm a goner
Believe me, I said I'm a goner
All my life, you've known I'm a goner
Believe me, I'm a goner
