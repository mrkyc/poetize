Bruises and scrapes
All life's mistakes
Are nothing but bad weather
Help you sneak in
All of my friends just so
We could leave together
The books I won't read
The air that I'll breathe
The colors I've seen
I'll leave these pages in the trees
Today
Leave good for great
Leave sleep for late
Leave good for great
Leave sleep for late
Leave good for great
Leave sleep for late
Leave good for great
Leave sleep for late

So many books that I didn't read
But there's so much air I chose to breathe
How about the colors that I've seen
So I'll leave these pages in the trees
You might also like
I don't sit alone
Or pick up my phone
One day we'll say all that we had
The beaten path is beaten fast
I'm practicing hooks and jabs
I've traced a few lines
Misread all the signs
Slipped many times
My blood's still red and I'm just fine
Today, leave good for great
Leave sleep for late
Leave good for great

So many books that I didn't read
But there's so much air I chose to breathe
How about the colors that I've seen
So I'll leave these pages in the trees
We sing along but the notes are wrong
We sing along through night and dawn
We sing along but the notes are wrong
We sing along through night and dawn
We sing along but the notes are wrong
We sing along through night and dawn
We sing along but the notes are wrong
We sing along through night and dawn
We sing along but the notes are wrong
We sing along through night and dawn
We sing along but the notes are wrong
We sing along through night and dawn
We sing along but the notes are wrong
We sing along through night and dawn
We sing along but the notes are wrong
