Oh, to good ol' Rock'n Roll
Whatever became of, hmm
Rhythm and Blues and Soul
I'll do what it takes, now
'Cause I just wanna
Make your mind feel good
The shit that they play now
Oh, it just don't feel like it should
So open your heart, open your mind
Turn down the hate, turn up the kind
Give me some shelter
Show me some love
Let's get together, one is not enough...
If you wanna sing a song, you just sing it
We're riding with the radio
You wanna bring a friend
You just bring'em
Then we can sing it in stereo
You wanna sing a song, sing a song
Sing a song, uuh, just sing it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Of these rhythm and harmonies
And just love, love, love
