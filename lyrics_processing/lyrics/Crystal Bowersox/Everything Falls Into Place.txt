It was hiding in the last place I thought that it would be
I was so busy looking around for something tried and true
Don't know why it took so long to fall in love with you
All of our time keeps on sliding
Every new day same sun is rising
Every morning when I wake up and my feet touch the ground
Every turn about the day may bring something more, something found
The day that I loved you, you're up so high, my saving grace
It's how I know everything falls into place
Gave away my last dollar, it was my last one to lose
Gave it to a man 'cause he bled red, white and blue
That man won the lottery but he was simple in his ways
Bought himself a brand new truck, gave the rest away
All of our time keeps on sliding
Every new day same sun is rising
Every morning when I wake up and my feet touch the ground
Every turn about the day may bring something more, something found
The day that I loved you, you're up so high, my saving grace
It's how I know everything falls into place
Everything that comes to me, even if it is a tragedy
Leaves me stronger than yesterday
Trust me, I've seen this before
Love and heart can open doors
And the pain will start to fade away

Every turn about the day may bring something more, something found
The day that I loved you, you're up so high, my saving grace
It's how I know everything falls into place
It's how I know everything falls into place
I know everything will be alright
I know it will fall into place
So in the worst time of need
There's a little voice that's telling me it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be alright
