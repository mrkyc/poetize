Where I stop nobody knows
Singing something to myself
Wishing I was somewhere else
You ain't got to got to be my friend
'Cause I don't know about me back again
But if you wanna wait out there
Come on, come on, come out and play
Yeah...
'Cause I, I'm on the run
And I'm just looking to have me some fun
Yeah, uh, uh
I, well, I don't need nobody
'Cause I'm on the run
Yeah, oh, I'm on the run...
Well, I ain't no superstitious
Pageant queen
I ain't trying to be no new James Dean
I ain't looking for a place to lay my head
Except a beach, a bench
Or a flower bed, oh
Don't fall in love with me
'Cause I have got to got to be free
But if you wanna wait out there
Come on, come on, come out and play
Yeah...

Nobody holding me back
So don't you hold me back, boy, no...
We're gonna take it slow
Cruise along, listen to the radio
And all dressed up and no place to go
I got my halo and got my gun
Got my guitar, got the sun
And if it wasn't for the devil onto my head
Love you but until I'm dead, yeah...
