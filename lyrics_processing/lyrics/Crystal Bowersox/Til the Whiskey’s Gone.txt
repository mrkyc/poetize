You're drinking up from my loving cup and now you're telling me goodbye!
But I ain't done, I ain't giving up, they gonna let you pass me by
So sip that down, have another round, cause we're running dry!
Cause this ain't over til the whiskey's gone
This ain't over til I leave!
Oh honey, you don't love me now, you with me for 
Cause this ain't over til the whiskey's gone oh yeah, yeah!
Uh, uh, uh, uh!
I thought that if I brought you here, we'd have a drink or two
Maybe I could change your mind, cause I'm still in love with you!
But you ain't drunk, I ain't giving up, I gotta get through to you
My glass might be half full, but I'm empty without you!
Cause this ain't over til the whiskey's gone
This ain't over til I leave!
Oh honey, you don't love me now, you with me for 
Cause this ain't over til the whiskey's gone, hey, hey!
Oh, oh well you, you're all I need
I chased you down to the bottom of the bottle, a long neck memory
You're so cold, cold depend on me
Cause I've been blowing your mind and pour it away
Maybe that will make you see!
