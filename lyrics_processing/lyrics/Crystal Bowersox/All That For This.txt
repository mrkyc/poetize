Do you remember?
My, how the time has gone
When we were sitting at Irving and Ashland
In a tiny room, we called it home
My, how the times change
We ain't never gonna be the same
I wanna love you forever
The way that I did, on the very first day
And I sat and cried for awhile
Then you did something crazy
Just to make me smile

All that I've been through
Is just a stepping stone
To where I'm going to
I ain't going alone
I'm going there with you
Even if it's nowhere
We finally made it here
All that for this

Well the baby's a boy now
He saying things like who, what, why
When, where and how
It's hard to believe that everything that we see
Comes from the very same dust cloud
But I don't know if that's truth
But if it is, I'm just happy
I found my way to you
So bear in the breeze, it's a little hot in my sleeve
But I'm just trying to get close to you
From across that great divide
What a beautiful thing
When our two worlds collide
You might also like
All that I've been through
Is just a stepping stone
To where I'm going to
I ain't going alone
I'm going there with you
Even if it's nowhere
We finally made it here
All that for this

So we'll stay together
Never ever say goodbye
Holding on in this love
And when push comes to shove
I know we'll be alright
We've been through it all by now
But if trouble comes around again
We'll weather the storm we'll be safe and warm
Until the very end
With arms stretched, open wide
I'll be waiting for you
On the other side

All that I've been through
Is just a stepping stone
To where I'm going to
I ain't going alone
I'm going there with you
Even if it's nowhere
We finally made it here
