Never needed anything
Summer breeze running free
Felt like we had everything
Suitcase full of dreams
You said you'd run away with me
But instead you let me leave your world
I can't and I can't forget how it felt
Being in love and believing
This feeling would never end...
So I just hold on to the memory
'Cause if I can't have you
Then I gotta hold on to something
I moved on to the bigger things
Whatever we go through
Still we gotta hold on to something
Still we gotta hold on to something
Still we gotta hold on to something...
A shoe box, broken dreams
This isn't what I found to be
'Cause I miss home, I'm here alone
Wishing you were here with me
And I can't breathe, these city streets
Feel like they're closing in on me
Can't believe you let me leave your world
I can't and I can't forget
How it felt being in love and believing
This feeling would never end...

Whatever we go through
Still we gotta hold on to something
Well, the part of our past
That we'll always have
We love, we laugh like we never have
Now we can we never go back...
So I just hold on to the memories
'Cause if I can't have you
Then I gotta hold on to something
I moved on to the bigger things
Whatever we go through
Still we gotta hold on to something
Hold on to the memories
