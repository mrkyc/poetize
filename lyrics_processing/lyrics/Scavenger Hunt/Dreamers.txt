We are the hunted
The chosen few
 style
Tempted by the south
It's friendly fire
But it's dangerous
This feeling stays
Always watching us
Let go (Did you feel it coming, did you feel it comin' oh oh)
Let go (Did you feel it coming, did you feel it comin' oh oh)
We want some black magic
We want to take control
Because when the lights go out
That's where the dreamers go
That's where the dreamers go oh oh
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
That's where the dreamers go oh oh
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
We're in a free fall
No end in sight
This endless fall
Let's  this fire
No will in night
We want our tastes up
Electrically
The singer sings
"You will find your spirit"
Let go (Did you feel it coming, did you feel it comin' oh oh)
Let go (Did you feel it coming, did you feel it comin' oh oh)
We want some black magic
We want to take control
Because when the lights go out
That's where the dreamers go
That's where the dreamers go oh oh
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
That's where the dreamers go oh oh
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh)
