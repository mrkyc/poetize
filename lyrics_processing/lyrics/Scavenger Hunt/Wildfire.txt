Do you remember when we felt so free?
Boys like you and girls like me
A thousand summers in my memory
Boys like you and girls like me
"We fight the dawn" is what you said to me
Boys like you and girls like me
How can you know just how it felt to be
Boys like you and girls like me?

And when you held my hand
Electricity was raining down
Can you hear that sound?
Light a match, we're burning up this town
And if I close my eyes
I can taste it, can't erase it

Some things aren't meant to last forever
Some hearts, they burn like a wildfire, wildfire
Keep pushing, I can set you free
Some things, you can't release
Burning, burning like a wildfire, wildfire

We live forever in my fantasy
Boys like you and girls like me
Can't find the words and I can't escape it
Boys like you and girls like me
You might also like
And when you held my hand
Electricity was raining down
Can you hear that sound?
Light a match, we're burning up this town
And if I close my eyes
I can taste it, can't erase it

Some things aren't meant to last forever
Some hearts, they burn like a wildfire, wildfire
Some hearts aren't meant to last together
Some hearts, they burn like a wildfire, wildfire
Keep pushing, I can set you free
Some things, you can't release
Burning, burning like a wildfire, wildfire
Keep pushing, I can it set you free
Can't stop the memories
Burning, burning like a wildfire, wildfire

Another time, another place
See your eyes in a stranger's face
And I'm frozen (frozen, frozen)
How could we know?
How could we see?
How beautiful that this could be?
I'm frozen (frozen, frozen)
Some things aren't meant to last forever
Some hearts, they burn like a wildfire, wildfire
Some hearts aren't meant to last together
Some hearts, they burn like a wildfire, wildfire
Some things aren't meant to last forever
Some hearts, they burn like a wildfire, wildfire
Some hearts aren't meant to last together
