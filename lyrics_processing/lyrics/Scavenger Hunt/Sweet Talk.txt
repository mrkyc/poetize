Tryin' to push you away, baby I want more
And I know this is only gonna hurt in the end
How did I get here again?
I'm not a cliche, I know you like it that way
Take the strength from my bones
Take the air from my lungs
But I just can't get away
I'm always back seat driving
You got your hand on the wheel
You don't know how it feels
You hit me with the sweet talk honey
And I know that I've lost all control now
You've got a hold on me
Sweet talk, sweet talk
You hit me with the sweet talk, sweet talk oh
Hit me with the sweet talk, sweet talk
Is what I need
I'm so sick of feeling like you use me as a crutch
Can't trust your touch, no it costs too much
Don't you know this is the only thing I wanna feel?
I gotta know it's real
You might also likeI'm not a cliche, I know you like it that way
Take the strength from my bones
Take the air from my lungs
But I just can't get away
I'm always back seat driving
You got your hand on the wheel
You don't know how it feels
You hit me with the sweet talk honey
And I know that I've lost all control now
You've got a hold on me
Sweet talk, sweet talk
You hit me with the sweet talk, sweet talk oh
Hit me with the sweet talk, sweet talk
Is what I need
I'm walking on a razor's edge
Getting close to falling
I'm trying not to lose my head
Still I hear you calling
I'm walking on a razor's edge
Getting close to falling
Still I hear you calling
I'm always back seat driving
You got your hand on the wheel
You don't know how it feels
You hit me with the sweet talk honey
And I know that I've lost all control now
You've got a hold on me
Sweet talk, sweet talk
You hit me with the sweet talk, sweet talk oh
Hit me with the sweet talk, sweet talk
Is what I need
