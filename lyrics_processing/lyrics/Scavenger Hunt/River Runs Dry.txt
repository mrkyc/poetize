Last the day like closing in
Feel the night slowly begin
How can you love what you don't know?
Look for me in afterglow

Wanted lust but I gave you truth
Reckless love and wasted youth
How can you hate what you don't see?
The reflection of you was always me

So tell me why
Am I last to know?
Cause I'm in this fight
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry
Don't tell me I
Would be better alone
Just don't let this die
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry

Will you miss the life you left behind?
To taste the dream you sought to find
Tell me why am I supposed to do?
With every breath I took for you?
You might also like
So tell me why
Am I last to know?
Cause I'm in this fight
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry
Don't tell me I
Would be better alone
Just don't let this die
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry

When you wanted lust but I gave you truth
Reckless love and wasted youth
Tell me why am I supposed to do?
With every breath I took for you?

How can you love what you don't know?
Look for me in the afterglow
How can you hate what you can't see?
The reflection of you was always me

How can you love what you don't know?
Look for me in the afterglow
How can you hate what you can't see?
The reflection of you was always me
How can you love what you don't know?
Look for me in the afterglow
How can you hate what you can't see?
The reflection of you was always me

So, tell me why
Am I last to know?
Cause I'm in this fight
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry
Don't tell me I
Would be better alone
Just don't let this die
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry
Till the river runs dry

So you wanted lust but I gave you truth
Reckless love and wasted youth
Tell me why am I supposed to do?
