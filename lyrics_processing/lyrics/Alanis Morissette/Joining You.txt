Dear dar', your mom, my friend
Left a message on my machine
She was frantic, saying you were talking crazy

That you wanted to do away with yourself
I guess she thought I'd be a perfect resort
'Cause we've had this inexplicable connection since our youth

And yes, they're in shock, they are panicked
You and your chronic, them and their drama
You, this embarrassment, us in the middle of this delusion

If we were our bodies
If we were our futures
If we were our defenses
I'd be joining you
If we were our culture
If we were our leaders
If we were our denials
I'd be joining you

I remember vividly a day years ago, we were camping
You knew more than you thought you should know
You said I don't want ever to be brainwashed

And you were mind-boggling, you were intense
You were uncomfortable in your own skin
You were thirsty, but mostly you were beautiful

If we were our name tags
If we were our rejections
If we were our outcomes
I'd be joining you
If we were our indignities
If we were our successes
If we were our emotions
I'd be joining you

You and I, we're like four-year-olds
We want to know why and how come about everything
We want to reveal ourselves at will and speak our minds

And never talk small and be intuitive
And question mightily and find God
My tortured beacon, we need to find like-minded companions

If we were their condemnations
If we were their projections
If we were our paranoias
I'd be joining you
If we were our incomes
If we were our obsessions
If we were our afflictions
I'd be joining you
We need reflection
We need a really good memory
