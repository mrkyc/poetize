I can be an asshole of the grandest kind
I can withhold like it's going out of style
I can be the moodiest, baby, and you've never met anyone
Who's as negative as I am sometimes

I am the wisest woman you've ever met
I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected
I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen
And you've never met anyone
Who's as positive as I am sometimes

You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

I blame everyone else, not my own partaking
My passive aggressiveness can be devastating
I'm terrified and mistrusting and you've never met anyone
Who's as closed down as I am sometimes

You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

What I resist, persists
And speaks louder than I know
What I resist, you love
No matter how low or high I go

I am the funniest woman that you've ever known
I am the dullest woman that you've ever known
I'm the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known
And you've never met anyone
Who's as everything as I am sometimes

You see everything (You see everything)
You see every part (You see every part)
You see all my light (You see all my light)
And you love my dark (And you love my dark)
You dig everything (You dig everything)
Of which I'm ashamed (Of which I'm ashamed)
There's not anything to which you can't relate
(There's not anything to which you can't relate)
And you're still here
(You see everything, you see every part)
And you're still here
(You see all my light and you love my dark)
Oh, and you're still here
(You dig everything of which I'm ashamed)
(There's not anything to which you can't relate)
