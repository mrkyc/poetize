I ain't ever been number two fucking with a nigga
I'm the situation, tell a bitch, go figure (Uh)
No top and the g-string
And I been the type of bitch to take everything
Niggas throw gifts and shit to see a bitch smile
And the house driveway about eight miles
They Froot Loop the wrist, they hit my PayPal
And these bitches can't take that I'm the wave now (Yeah)
We body the body
He rubbing it on me, he wanna get naughty (Naughty)
But I know if I fall in my feelings, get deep and he bitin' the body
So I don't even play with him
Whitest man, hood stiff and his hands grabbing tight on my blue denim
My Louboutins, can a bitch feel 'em?
I let a nigga know quick, I'm a self-made go-getter
We body the body, he throwin' me keys to the Phantom big body (Big Body)
He shopping to buy, he import and export, I take classes, Pilates
Bank-bank account stretched like elastic
You can pop a rubber band or you can swipe the plastic
I make him blow the whole damn bank, do damage
'Cause if he don't swipe the card, you ain't a bad bitch (Yeah)
