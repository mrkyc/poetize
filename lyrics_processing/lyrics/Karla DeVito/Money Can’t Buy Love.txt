Oh-oh-oh, I've got you on my mind
You're locked inside my heart
I want you all the time
And when I sleep at night
I dream you're by my side
I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna shake you, make you realize

There's just one thing I've got to give
And all the money in the world can't ever buy you this

Money can't buy love (Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love, love)
Can't buy true love (Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love, love)

Oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh, ba-da, ba-da
Woah-oh, ba-da, ba-da
You might also like
I-I-I-I'm not a millionaire
I ain't got no fancy clothes
But all I've got, I wanna share
And I know a million ways to let you know I care
My love can take you there
Our love can take us anywhere

There's just one thing you've gotta trust
And it costs you nothing, but it's worth so much

Money can't buy love (Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love, love)
Can't buy true love (Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love)

So when you're sad, remember this
It only takes one kiss
(Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
(Money can't buy love, love)
(Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
(Money can't buy love, love)
Money can't buy love
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love, love)
Can't buy true love
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love, love)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love, love)
Can't buy true love (Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love, love)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy)
(Money, money can't buy)
Money can't buy love (Money can't buy love, love)
