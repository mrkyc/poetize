Things look clear in black and white
But living color tends to dull our sight
Like dynamite
Just imagine my surprise
When I looked into your eyes and saw
Through your disguise

If we dare expose our hearts
Just reveal the purest parts
That's when strange sensations start to grow

We are not alone
You'll find out when your cover's blown
There'll be somebody there to break your fall
We are not alone
'Cause when you cut down to the bone
We're really not so different after all
After all
Not alone

Flying high above the sky
The patterns down below look simplified
A good place to hide
But on inspection of the dust
We came upon this thing called trust
It helps us to adjust
You might also like
Just imagine my surprise
When I looked into your eyes
I knew right then I'd never let you go

We are not alone
You'll find out when your cover's blown
There'll be somebody there to break your fall
We are not alone
'Cause when you cut down to the bone
We're really not so different after all
After all
We're not alone
Not alone
After all
Not alone


If we dare expose our hearts
Just reveal the purest parts
That's when strange sensations start to grow

We are not alone
You'll find out when your cover's blown
There'll be somebody there to break your fall
We are not alone
'Cause when you cut down to the bone
We're really not so different after all
We are not alone
You'll find out when your cover's blown
There'll be somebody there to break your fall
We are not alone
'Cause when you cut down to the bone
We're really not so different after all
After all
After all
After all
We are not alone
