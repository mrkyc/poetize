So this is how the story ends, you found a replacement
I thought that she was just a friend but you were just pacing
Huh, in a position to be taking my place
Yeah you needed time away so I gave you your space
You see now you're the type of guy to give your homies a bad breath
Unofficial gains on my love you's a bad rep
All around town, I hear stories all around
You've been making this peng ting really look like a clown
Uuwi, kumbe settings zilikwama to player
And now I finally got you  like a layer
That you were only here for a good time, not a long time
Ever since you saw the sunshine it was bye-bye
Got yourself a new bae (New bae)
Even if it take time guess I gotta let you go, cause you already at the door
And man I wish you the best, I hope the grass is truly greener on the other side

If you wanna leave go, baby don't come back
Go, baby
If you wanna leave go baby
Go baby don't come back
That good love is hard to find
A good wife I don't deserve to cry
Go baby don't come back
I won't be the one to make you stay

So tell me right now, is she really everything
That you wanted her to be? That she do it better it than me
Cause boy I gave you everything, you were number one put you up on a pedestal
But you chose to run, and that's the last thought I have about you
Got so many other options I don't even gotta choose
So, imma keep it walking like I got some Jimmy Choo's on, you thought I wasn't gonna move
So why you blowing up my phone?
I thought you found your Cinderella and your comb
You said that she would be there for you under any type of weather
So I better go ahead and move along
Haha, I bet karma got you, it's the best show ever man I got the best view
And I thought you said something about wedding bells
Guess its just another lie on your story tales
Miss me

If you wanna leave go, baby don't come back
Go, baby
If you wanna leave go baby
Go baby don't come back
That good love is hard to find
A good wife I don't deserve to cry
Go baby don't come back
I won't be the one to make you stay
Now, what the hell is wrong with you?
Who do you think you are?
Playing me for a fool I'll go figure
Didn't think I'll find out
Jibu maswali, ukishindwa basi, uende kwa kasi, hakuna nafasi
Now, what the hell is wrong with you? Let me tell you one time

If you wanna leave go, baby don't come back
Go, baby
If you wanna leave go baby
Go baby don't come back
That good love is hard to find
A good wife I don't deserve to cry
Go baby don't come back
I won't be the one to make you stay
