You know them
You can see the difference?
No, no, no, no
We got Karun on this
Wangechi

I'm having analogue dreams, in a digital world
It's like colored water, flooding through my stream
Looking under the veil, no we couldn't be
I see denim jeans and a plain white tee

And I'm like take and inhale
Press the reboot
Hope it won't sail away
(To where?) where I don't know
Where I don't need to know
And I'm like take and inhale
Press the reboot
Hope it won't sail away
(To where?) Where I don't know
Where you don't wanna know

I'm dreaming, somewhere on the milky way
I'm living, somewhere where these dreams take form
We got the 4K, switching from the 1080p
We moving all day, no more shuffle, pause and repeat
Back to the same old, same old, Control-ALT-Delete
Remove that copy-paste, edit yourself from this world
We writing JavaScript can't switch from the program
Close your eyes and take a demon to this analogue dream

Can't see the difference between pixels red, blue, and green
Take a dip into this black and white reality
Ay, Ay, Ay, and what's the sound in my head?
A-a-analogue dreams
Sound in my head?
Analogue dreams
And what's the sound in my head?
A-a-a-a-analogue dreams
Sounds like analogue dreams

And what's the frequency, I should be tuned into
I'm not a Looney Tune, I got a good state of mind
So don't mind me, as I roam this world like it's mine
Like Cain, I am able to imagine  a space where I do me 3D
So shake the Rubik's cube, align all the colors extra extra
We got new news in this world, we are spread to the telescope
Some new dreamers but we dreaming while we wide awake
Ah

And I'm like take and inhale
Press the reboot
Hope it won't sail away
(To where?) where I don't know
Where I don't need to know
And I'm like take and inhale
Press the reboot
Hope it won't sail away
(To where?) Where I don't know
Where you don't wanna know
Can't see the difference between pixels red, blue, and green
Take a dip into this black and white reality
Ay, Ay, Ay, and what's the sound in my head?
A-a-analogue dreams
Sound in my head?
Analogue dreams
And what's the sound in my head?
A-a-a-a-analogue dreams
Sounds like analogue dreams

Take a trip, a thousand miles away
To the golden age
Yeah the golden age (Age, Age, Age)
And carry me away to a place
Deactivate and override the system
Override the system (System)
Then we come back to life
Uh, Ooh, Oh

Can't see the difference between pixels red, blue, and green
Take a dip into this black and white reality
Ay, Ay, Ay, and what's the sound in my head?
A-a-analogue dreams
Sound in my head?
Analogue dreams
And what's the sound in my head?
A-a-a-a-analogue dreams
Sounds like analogue dreams
Ooh
Analogue dreams
Analogue dreams
