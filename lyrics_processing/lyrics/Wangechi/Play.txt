Play that discography of our love
Now-now-now now play it over
Play that discography of our love
And-and-and-and-and and then we go
Strangers, friends, friends to lovers
Lovers, strangers, and back again
And then we go
Strangers, friends, friends to lovers
Lovers, strangers, and back again

You can say that the first date was the sophomore album
Introducing the man with the undercover love
And it's amusing, how he says that he only wants to give it to me
Ngoja kidogo, do you know that you got a long way to go
It's more than a 30 seconds intro you know
Hakuna love at first sight, vibrating through my eardrums
Unaweza kuwa my first baby do for love
And we can hit it from the top like the ceilings above

Like  rapping calling man's so when I decide to get down
On my luck now its three tracks done
Now we already addicted
Kuna venye I be playing, replaying, and shuffling up
Until I get all the lyrics stuck in my head and the beat in my heart
Sasa, cheza prelude to the interlude and that's love
And that's the feeling I need
Ah ah ah

Play that discography of our love
Now-now-now now play it over
Play that discography of our love
And-and-and-and-and and then we go
Strangers, friends, friends to lovers
Lovers, strangers, and back again
And then we go
Strangers, friends, friends to lovers
Lovers, strangers, and back again

Now we onto the next one
Na mama alisema love is cursed by monogamy
ASAP yaani namaanisha
He got clande's on his left side, unajua naweza chizi you can call me Left-Eye
Say bye-bye to my symphonies and hallo hallo to my acapella love
And
