As long as stars shine down from heaven
And the rivers run into the sea
'Till the end of time forever
You're the only love I'll ever need
In my life you're all that matters
In my eyes the only truth I see
When my hopes and dreams have shattered
You're the one thats there for me

When I found you I was blessed
And I will never leave you, I need you

Imagine me without you
I'd be lost and so confused
I wouldn't last a day, I'd be afraid
Without you there to see me through
Imagine me without you
Lord, you know is just impossible
Because of you, It's all brand new
My life is now worthwhile
I can't imagine me without you

When I met you I was falling
You love lifted me back on my feet
It was like you heard my calling
And you rushed to set me free
