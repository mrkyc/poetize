I like the way that you look when you're lookin' at me, at me
And how our bodies can say everything that we think, we think
You're telling me everything with your eyes
'Cause you can feel that you're already mine
You wanna ask, go ahead and I'll make you believe

You don't have to be sola, you don't have to be here alone
And if you wanna slow down, then slow down, it's only los dos
Just tell me where to go and I'll follow your love
Been showin' up alone, but we're leaving as one
You don't have to be sola, you don't have to be here alone
You're with me-e-e-e-e (Ayy)
You're with me-e-e-e-e-e

Can't look away
Feels like thee moment is frozen and time is erased (Ayy)
There's not a chance or a reason my mind's gonna change the way I feel
I'm gonna show you how this love is real, come on
Baby, I know what you want

You don't have to be sola, you don't have to be here alone
And if you wanna slow down, then slow down, it's only los dos
Just tell me where to go and I'll follow your love
Been showin' up alone, but we're leaving as one
You don't have to be sola, you don't have to be here alone
You're with me-e-e-e-e (Ayy)
You're with me-e-e-e-e-e

You don't have to be sola, you don't have to be here alone
And if you wanna slow down, then slow down, it's only los dos

Been showin' up alone, but we're leaving as one
You don't have to be sola, you don't have to be here alone
You don't have to be sola, you don't have to be here alone
