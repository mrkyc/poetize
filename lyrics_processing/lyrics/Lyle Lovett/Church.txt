I went to church last Sunday
So I could sing and pray
But something quite unusual
It happened on that day

Church, it started right on time
Just like it does without a doubt
And everything was all just fine
Except when it came time to let us out

You know, the preacher, he kept preaching
He told us, "I have one more thing to say
Children, before you think of leaving
You'd better think about the Judgment Day"

Now everyone got nervous
Because everyone was hungry too
And everyone was wondering
What was the next thing he would do

And the preacher, he kept preaching
He said, "Now I'll remind you, if I may
You all better pay attention
Or I might decide to preach all day"

And now everyone was getting so hungry
And the old ones started feeling ill
And the weak ones started passing out
And the young ones, they could not sit still

And the preacher's voice rose higher
I snuck up to the balcony
And I crept into the choir
And I begged them, "Brothers, sisters, help me please"

I said when I give you a signal
I said when I raise up my hands
Won't you please join with me together?
And praise the Lord, I have a plan

And the preacher he kept preaching
Long is the struggle, hard the fight
And I prayed, "Father, please forgive me"
And then I stood up and with all my might
I sang

"To the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
And I listened to what the preacher said
Now it's to the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat"
Yes and I did give a signal
Yes and I raised up my hands
And then joined with me the choir
Yes and every woman, child, and man
They sang

"To the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
And I've listened to what the preacher said
Now it's to the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat"

And the preacher, he stopped preaching
And a hush, the church did fill
And then a great white dove from up above
Landed on the windowsill

And the dove flew down beside him
A fork appeared right in his hand
And with everybody watching
The preacher ate that bird right there and then
And now everyone got really nervous
And the preacher, he did start to glow
And as we watched on in disbelief
These were the words he spoke

He said, "Mama's in the kitchen
And she's been there all day
I know she's cooking something good
So let's bow our heads and pray"
And he sang

"To the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat"

And the moral of this story
Children, it is plain but true
God knows if a preacher preaches long enough
Even he'll get hungry too
And he'll sing

"To the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now, let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
