Oh, my brother, you've gone before me
And how I long to be with you
But through my sorrow
As I remain here
There is only one thing that I can do

So I'm gonna wait (I'm gon' wait)
Just a little bit longer (Just a little bit longer)
I'm gonna pray (I'm gonna pray)
On bended knee (Bended knee)
I'm gonna wait (I'm gon' wait)
Just a little bit longer (Just a little bit longer)
Until my Savior (Savior comes for me)
He comes for me

Now I have faith
Built on a mountain
Greater than
A mustard seed
If I wait
Just a little bit longer
I know my Savior (He will come for me)
Will come for me
