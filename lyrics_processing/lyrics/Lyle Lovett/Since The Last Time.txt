Lord, it made me happy
Seeing all those people that I ain't seen
Since the last time somebody died
Everybody talking
They were telling funny stories
Saying all those things that they ain't said
Since the last time somebody died
But you take a look around you
Don't it seem like something's missing?
I said something that went missing
Lord, the last time somebody died
You took him from the last time
To that hallowed ground
I'm praying take me to the next time, Lord
So I can hang around
Then the people start to looking
And some of them start crying
And all the little children, Lord, they're scared
'Cause they ain't never seen a dead man before
You took him from the last time
To that hallowed ground
I'm praying take me to the next time, Lord
So I can hang around

I think I'll stay dry
Now it's a church on Sunday
It's a bar on Friday night
It's work on Monday
The preacher, Lord, you know he might sing
Hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
He's got church on Sunday
He got drunk the night before
And he got his good gal when he got home
The preacher said he wants some more of that
Hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

Now if you want to get to heaven, let me tell you what to do
You better grease your foot up, buddy, with that old mutton stew
And when the devil comes after you with them greasy hands
You just slide on over to the promised land
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Now there was two little imps and they was black as tar
And they was trying to get to heaven in an electric car
And that car wheel slipped on down the hill
Instead of going to heaven, they went to Jacksonville
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Thank you, you've been so nice
All my friends, they came
Now close the lid down tightly and quit crying
'Cause when they close them, they all look the same
And grab hold of the handle
It won't be too heavy
And take me to the graveyard
I went to a funeral
And, Lord, it made me happy
Seeing all those people that I ain't seen
