This old porch is like a big old red and white Hereford bull
Standing under a mesquite tree out in Agua Dulce
And he just keeps on playing hide and seek with that hot August sun
Just a-sweatin' and a-pantin' 'cause his work is never done

And this old porch is like a steaming, greasy plate of enchiladas
With lots of cheese and onions and a guacamole salad
And you can get 'em down at the La Salle Hotel in old downtown
With iced tea and a waitress and she will smile every time

And this old porch is the Palace walk-in on the main street of Texas
That's never seen the day of G and R and X's
With that '62 poster that's almost faded down
And a screen without a picture since Giant came to town


And this old porch is like a, a weathered, gray-haired seventy years of Texas
Who's doing all he can not to give in to the city
And he always takes the rent late, so long as I run the cattle
And he picks me up at dinnertime and I listen to him rattle
See Lyle Lovett LiveGet tickets as low as $39You might also like
He says the Brazos still runs muddy just like she's run all along
There ain't never been no cane to grind, the cotton's all but gone
And you know this brand new Chevrolet, hell, it was something back in the '60s
But now there won't nobody listen to him 'cause they all think he's crazy

And this old porch is just a long time of waiting and forgetting
And remembering the coming back and not crying about the leaving
And remembering the falling down and the laughter of the curse of luck
From all of those passers-by who said we'd never get back up


This old porch is just a long time of waiting and forgetting
And remembering the coming back and not crying about the leaving
And remembering the falling down and the laughter of the curse of luck
