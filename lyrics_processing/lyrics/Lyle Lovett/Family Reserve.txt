When I saw the ambulance screaming down Main Street
I didn't give it a thought
But it was my Uncle Eugene, he died on October
The second, 1981

And my Uncle Wilbur, they all called him Skinner
And they said for his younger ways
He'd get drunk in the morning and show me the rolls of fifties and hundreds
He kept in the glove box of his old gray Impala

And we're all gonna be here forever
So, mama, don't you make such a stir
Now put down that camera and come on and join up
The last of the family reserve

Now my second cousin, his name was Callaway
He died when he'd barely turned two
And it was peanut butter and jelly that did it
The help, she didn't know what to do
She just stood there and she watched him turn blue

And we're all gonna be here forever
So, mama, don't you make such a stir
Just put down that camera and come on and join up
The last of the family reserve

And my friend Brian Temple, he thought he could make it
So from the third story, he jumped
And he missed the swimming pool only by inches
And everyone said he was drunk


Now there was Great Uncle Julius and there was Aunt Annie Miller
And Mary and Granddaddy Paul
And there was Hannah and Ella and Alvin and Alec
And he owned his own funeral hall

And there are more I remember and more I could mention
Than words I could write in a song
But I feel 'em watching and I see 'em laughing
And I, I hear 'em singing along

We're all gonna be here forever
So, mama, don't you make such a stir
Just put down that camera and come on and join up
