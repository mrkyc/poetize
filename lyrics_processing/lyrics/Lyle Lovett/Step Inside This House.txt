Was painted by a friend
He gave it to me all down and out
When he owed me ten
It doesn't look like much, I guess
But it's all that's left of him
It sure is nice from right over here
When the light's a little dim
Step inside this house, girl
I'll sing for you a song
I'll tell you about just where I've been
It shouldn't take too long
I'll show you all the things that I own
My treasures, you might say
It couldn't be more then ten dollars worth
They brighten up my day
This book of poems was given me
By a girl I used to know
I guess I read it front to back
Fifty times or so
It's all about the good life
And staying at ease with the world
It's funny how I love that book
And I never loved that girl

Hold this piece of glass
Up to the light that's shining through the door
It's a prism glass, I found it on the road
Can't you see that tiny rainbow?
It's not really a prism, I guess
It just kind of broke a funny way
I was on my way through Houston
And I was headed for LA
Step inside this house, girl
I'll sing for you a song
I'll tell you about just where I've been

This guitar was given me
By old man Thomas Gray
It's not too much to look at
But I play it every day
It's been across this country
Four or five times, I guess
Between me and old man Tom
It never got much rest
Step inside this house, girl
I'll sing for you a song
I'll tell you about where I've been
It shouldn't take too long
I'll show you all the things that I own
My treasures, you might say
Couldn't be more then ten dollars worth
They brighten up my day
Well, that's just about all that I own
Or that I care to, I guess
Except this pair of boots maybe
And that funny yellow vest
And that leather jacket and that leather bag
And that hat hanging on the wall
Just so it's not too much to carry, babe
Could I see you again next fall?
Step inside this house, girl
I'll sing for you a song
I'll tell you about just where I've been
It shouldn't take too long
I'll show you all the things that I own
My treasures, you might say
Couldn't be more then ten dollars worth
