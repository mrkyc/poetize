I drink a cup of coffee
I look out of the window
I try to get a-started
I turn it all over
Plough it all under
I plant 'em in the spring time
I pick 'em in the summer
I live in my own mind
Ain't nothin' but a good time
No rain, just the sunshine
Out here in my own mind
I live where I can breathe
Ain't nothin' but a cool breeze
Nobody that it won't please
Out here where you can breathe
Mandy and Dary
They'll show back up any day
That's one thing you can count on
But sometimes they'll be long gone
I'd rather be huntin'
Hooked on fishin'
I read it on the t-shirts
But if you don't believe it

Out here where you can breathe
Hardwood floor-a-creakin'
Bedroom door squeekin'
She's standing in the kitchen
I thought she was still sleepin'
Kiss her on the forehead
Ask her how she slept
She says, "Honey it's so early
We probably shouldn't speak yet"
