Once upon a time ago
Way up in the land of sleet and snow
How this fairytale would go, I could not have known
I had searched around this world so mean
From Livingston to Palestine
Trying to pursue my dream of love
Well, it was then I met this girl so fine
She made me think so fast, I left my thoughts behind
And I tried to pass for a sophisticated Northern man
I said, "Why yes, my dear, I know exactly what you mean
Because there's not so much I haven't done or seen
And may I say your eyes are the loveliest shade of jade"

I said, "Come on, baby
Well, come on, baby
Ooh-ooh, come on, baby"

Well, it was then I knew I had made my first mistake
She did not even start to wait
And as she turned around to walk away
This is what she had to say
She told me, "Man, I come from way down South
I've got a picket fence with a picket house
And I don't need no fast-talking Northern man like you around"

I said, "Well, come on, baby
Oh, come on, baby
Ooh-ooh, come on, baby"

Honey, I don't know what you just heard
But Alabama is my favorite word
And Birmingham is a long way from here
Well, I could see her light begin to shine
She turned back around, her eyes met mine
And suddenly the whole world became a better place
Even if it was only for an instant
Because it was then I knew I had made my second mistake
She told me, "Man, that was a real good try
But Alabama's not where I reside
I come from where the river is wide and the crawfish hide"

I said, "Well, come on, baby
Oh, come on, baby
Ooh-ooh, come on, baby"

Honey, I don't know what you just heard
But Louisiana is my favorite word
And New Orleans is a long way from here
Well, she just looked at me and she shook her head
"Your lines are pretty sad," she said
"You are a lonely, weak, pathetic man
If this is doing the best you can"
It was then I knew I had made my third mistake
Yes, three strikes right across the plate
And as I hollered, "Honey, please wait!"
She was gone
I said, "Well, come on, baby
Well, come on, baby
Ooh-ooh, come on, baby"

Honey, I don't know what you just heard
"Bartender, set 'em up" are my favorite words
Because the love I need is a long way from here
Oh, the love I need is a long way from here
Yes, well, there I sat so all alone
Like a king who sits upon his throne
And whose kingdom may have just gone home with another kingdom

So as you can imagine, much to my surprise
When the door was flung back open wide
It was a miracle, she walked inside
And pulled her chair up next to me
And that's when she knew
She had made her first mistake

Well, honey, I don't know just what you heard
But "Come on, baby" are my favorite words
And where we're going is a long way from here
And where we're going to is a long way from here
So like I said before, I could not have known
How this fairytale would finally go
Still the only certain thing for sure is what I do not know
So like the years and all the seasons pass
And like the sand runs through the hourglass
I just keep on running faster
Chasing the happily I am ever after
I just keep on running faster
