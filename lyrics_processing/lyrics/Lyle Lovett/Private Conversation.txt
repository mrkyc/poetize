And his hand, it fell behind her
As his arm, it reached around
Oh, and she looked at the window
And she watched the shade go down
It was a private conversation
No one heard her say
That man she left behind her
Was two thousand miles away

Singing boy, pick up that fiddle
Ooh and play that steel guitar
Ooh and find yourself a lady
Ooh and dance right where you are
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

There was a lonely girl from nowhere
With a smile all sweet with pain
Oh, and she never stopped to wonder
Ooh, if she'd see him again
It was a private conversation
No one heard her say
That man that she was looking for
Was only twenty streets away

That girl he left behind him
Was two thousand miles away

He just sang, boy, pick up that fiddle
Ooh, and play that steel guitar
Ooh, and find yourself a lady

And the moral of this story
Is I guess it's easier said than done

No one hears you say
