Watch over us, please
As we wander around
In this dangerous world
Thank Mother Maria
There's nothing so sweet
As the undying love
Of a South Texas girl
Three in the front seat
They sat on each side
That green and white '58 Fairlane
It would glide
Down farm roads past open fields
Seeming like no big deal
As it was happening
I never felt a thing
But now, looking back
It seems like it was everything
Singing with Mom
Just so we could hear ourselves sing
Stealing a drink
From the cold can in Daddy's lap
Protected by only
A small, thin, brown paper sack

Of long-faded voices
And they'd sing me a song
That the old cowboys sang
And I didn't know
What the words meant or anything
I was just singing
Because I was supposed to

Watch over us, please
As we wander around
In this dangerous world
Thank Mother Maria
There's nothing so sweet
As the undying love
Of a South Texas girl
And with the windows wide open
It felt hot to us anyway
Three bound together
On a day just like any day
They told me and taught me
And showed me and bought me
Whatever I wanted
From the corner U-Totem
They said, "The name Corpus Christi
Means the body of Jesus
Pronounce it Refugio
City folks, they don't know"
"It looks like Palacios
But sounds like Palashes
Just listen the next time
You're watchin' Sid Lasher"
And the wind blew the echoes
Of long-faded voices
And they would sing me a song
That the old cowboys sang
And I didn't know
What the words meant or anything
I was just singing
Saint Mother Maria
Watch over us, please
As we wander around
In this dangerous world
Thank Mother Maria
There's nothing so sweet
As the undying love
Of a South Texas girl
And I didn't know
What the words meant or anything
I was just singing
And these days, with car seats
And open container laws
Social correctness
Leaves no room for Santa Claus
Sitting right next to me
She looks like that used-to-be
Song that they sang for me
And with the windows wide open
It feels hot to us anyway
Two bound together
On a day just like any day
The wind blows the echoes
Of long-faded voices
And they sing us a song
That the old cowboys sang
And now that I know
What the words mean and everything
I am still singing
Saint Mother Maria
Watch over us, please
As we wander around
In this dangerous world
Thank Mother Maria
There's nothing so sweet
As the undying love
Of a South Texas girl
Saint Mother Maria
Watch over us, please
As we stumble around
In this dangerous world
Thank Mother Maria
There's nothing so sweet
As the undying love
Of a South Texas girl
As the undying love
