I rode across the great high plains
Under the scorching sun and through the driving rain
And when I set my sights on the mountains high
I bid my former life goodbye

So thank you, man, I must decline
For it's on my steed I will rely
I've learned to need the open sky
Well, I'm subject to the natural forces
Home is where my horse is

We loaded up in Buffalo
We took 90 South down to Ohio
On 80 West, I'm Frisco-bound
And when I get there, I'll turn back around

So thank you, man, I must decline
For it's on these eighteen wheels I ride
I learned to need the western sky
Well, I'm subject to the natural forces
Home is where my horse is

And every year, they come to town
And they'll drag 'em all right in the ground
And when Mr. Bradley calls the score
Every cowboy there will try for more

So thank you, man, I must decline
For it's on my three-year-old I ride
And I'll spin and run and stop and slide
But I'm subject to the natural forces
Home is where my horse is


The Cherokee and the Chickasaw
The Creek Seminole and the old Chocktaw
We volunteered to move, they say
And we'll understand come Judgement Day

So thank you, man, I must decline
For it's on this trail of tears I ride
Out under Oklahoma skies
Sometimes at night, I hear their voices
Home is where my horse is
Now as I sit here safe at home
With a cold Coors Light and the TV on
All the sacrifice and the death and woe
Lord, I pray that I'm worth fighting for

So thank you, man, I must decline
For it's on my RPG I ride
'Til earth and hell are satisfied
Well, I'm subject to the natural forces
And sometimes at night, I hear their voices
Home is where my horse is
