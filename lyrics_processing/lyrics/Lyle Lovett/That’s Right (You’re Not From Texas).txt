You say you're not from Texas
Man, as if I couldn't tell
Well, you think you pull your boots on right
And wear your hat so well
So pardon me my laughter
'Cause I sure do understand
Even Moses got excited
When he saw the promised land

That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway

See, I was born and raised in Texas
And it means so much to me
Though my girl comes from down in Georgia
We were up in Tennessee
And as we were driving down the highway
She asked me, "Baby, what's so great?
How come you're always going on
About your Lone Star State?"

I said, "That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway"
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas

Oh the road, it looked so lovely
As she stood there on the side
And she grew smaller in my mirror
As I watched her wave goodbye

Those boys from Carolina
They sure enough could sing
But when they came on down to Texas
We all showed them how to swing
Now David's on the radio
And old Champ's still on the guitar
And Uncle Walt, he's home with Heidi
Hiding in her loving arms
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway

They're OK in Oklahoma
Up in Arkansas, they're fair
But those old folks in Missouri
They don't even know you're there
But at a dance hall down in Texas
That's the finest place to be
The women, they all look beautiful
And their men will buy your beer for free

And they'll say, "That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway"
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway
So won't you let me help you, Mister
Just pull your hat down the way I do
And buy your pants just a little longer
And next time somebody laughs at you

You just tell 'em you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
That's right, you're not from Texas
