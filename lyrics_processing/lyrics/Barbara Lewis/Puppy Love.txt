Puppy, puppy, puppy
Puppy love, puppy love
Puppy love, puppy love
Puppy love

Puppy love (puppy love)
I thought that I had
Fallen in love with you
But it was only puppy love
(Only puppy love)

Only puppy love (only puppy love)
Puppy love (puppy love)
I thought that my
Love for you was really true
But it was only puppy love
(Only puppy love)
Only puppy love (only puppy love) (do)

Remember when you held me
Tight in your arms (aa-oop)
You told me I was
Your good luck charm (do)
You might also like
I answered back
You're my number one man (aa-oop)
The one who really loves you
Said it again  (oop)

Now where's my love
What has it become (aaa-oop)
Instead of hearing bells
I hear drums

Well, I thought it was love
(Thought it was love)
'Cause my heart went
Rocking and a reeling
Felt a tingle in my feet
But it was only puppy love
(Only puppy love)

Only puppy love (only puppy love)
Puppy love (puppy love)

Oh, well, now you feel so silly
When you find that it was really
Only puppy love (only puppy love)
Only puppy love (only puppy love) (doo)
Remember when you held me
Tight in your arms (aa-oop)
You told me I was
Your good luck charm (doo)

I answered back
You're my number one man (aa-oop)
The one who really loves you
Said it again  (doo)

Now where's my love
What has it become (aa-oop)
Instead of hearing bells
I hear drums

Well, I thought it was love
(Thought it was love)
'Cause my heart went
Rocking and a reeling
Felt a tingle in my feet

But it was only puppy love
(Only puppy love)
Yes, it was only puppy love
(Only puppy love)
Oh, puppy love (puppy love)
Oh, well, now you feel so silly
When you find that it was really
Only puppy love (only puppy love)
