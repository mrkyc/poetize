Like a wheel within a wheel
Never-ending or beginning
On an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain
Or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning
Running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
Like a tunnel that you follow
To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving
In a half-forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble
Someone threw in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
You might also likeKeys that jingle in your pocket
Words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly?
Was it something that you said?
Lovers walk along the shore
Leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming
Thompin' of the fingers on your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway
And the fragment of a song
Half remembered names of faces
But to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over
You were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the color of his hair!
Like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never-ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your ever-lovin' mind!
In the windmills of your mind
Windmills of your mind
Windmills of your mind
Windmills of your mind
In the windmills of your mind
In the windmills of your mind
