I watch the white lines pass alone
There is no moon so I just drive
I feel like the last man alive
I find a voice on the radio
It sounds like someone I used to know
He sends out songs that are sad and slow
For us with nowhere else to go
That's when I get to crying
And crying never makes no sense
When too much has gone on for it
To ever be coincidence
Who's gonna take you to the moon
Who's gonna take you to the stars
Who's gonna wait around for you
Who's gonna bring you back from Mars
I'm gonna take you to the moon
I'm gonna show you 'round the stars
But if I take you to the moon
Will you come back the way you are
If absence makes the heart grow fond
Why does my presence seem so wrong
If I am here and you are gone
I wonder what it is I've done

And crying never makes no sense
When too much has gone on for it
To ever be coincidence
Who's gonna take you to the moon
Who's gonna take you to the stars
Who's gonna wait around for you
Who's gonna bring you back from Mars
I'm gonna take you to the moon
I'm gonna show you 'round the stars
But if I take you to the moon
Will you come back the way you are
We keep our secrets to ourselves
We leave those lies for someone else
We rise above what we used to be
Don't get discouraged easily
That's when there's no more crying
'Cause crying never makes no sense
When too much has gone on for it
To ever be coincidence
Who's gonna take you to the moon
Who's gonna take you to the stars
Who's gonna wait around for you
Who's gonna bring you back from Mars
I'm gonna take you to the moon
I'm gonna show you 'round the stars
But if I take you to the moon
Will you come back the way you are
I'm gonna take you to the moon
I'm gonna show you 'round the stars
But if I take you to the moon
