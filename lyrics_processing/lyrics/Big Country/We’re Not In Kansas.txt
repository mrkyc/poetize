Did you learn to run when the teachers pray
Did they teach you enough To know the state you're in
Not enough to get out, not enough to win
What did you learn at home today
Did you learn to hate in the proper way
Did your liberated parents, patronize your friends
'Cos they had enough money, 'cos they had the right skin
I wander 'round thinking
Well, what kind of place is this
Well maybe it's in the parks
Ah, maybe it's in the stores
But I know if we're being honest
It's in the people
But they're all caught up in the traffic
Listening to the weather
Well, dog
I know we're not in Kansas
The sky's all colored wrong
I know we're not in Kansas
The days are all too long
I sure don't understand this
That's what you're howling for
I know we're not in Kansas
Kansas anymore
You might also likeWhat did you learn in your job today
Did you learn to sleep while the boss is away
Did you shut your mouth when he called you down
'Cos there's not much work in that kind of town
I wander around thinking
Well, what kind of place is this
Where they say hey
Ah, what did you do in the war
And I ask them well, hey, man
Ah, what did you do with the peace
Well, we built these real safe weapons
So we could sleep with ease
Well, dog
I know we're not in Kansas
The sky's all colored wrong
I know we're not in Kansas
The days are all too long
I sure don't understand this
That's what you're howling for
I know we're not in Kansas
Kansas anymore
Well, what kind of place is this
On the wrong side of the rainbow
Where the twisters never come
And they tore up all the yellow bricks
And they sold them to Japan
And still the advertisers tell you
Hey, there's no place like home
Well, dog
I know we're not in Kansas
The sky's all colored wrong
I know we're not in Kansas
The days are all too long
I sure don't understand this
That's what you're howling for
I know we're not in Kansas
Kansas anymore
I know we're not in Kansas
The sky's all colored wrong
I know we're not in Kansas
The days are all too long
I sure don't understand this
That's what you're howling for
I know we're not in Kansas
