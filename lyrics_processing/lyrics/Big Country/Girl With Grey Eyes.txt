That you deal in like a gambler
It makes me feel that I'm a winner
Or a sinner and I'm branded
I feel your skin so warm beside me
And I can hide me in your dreaming
You hold me near inside your fear
And I can feel the blood that's running
Just like Josephine
It will not be tonight
Still I have the dream
Still I have the sight
Will you and I always be like this
Will you and I always have this
I only see those sad grey eyes
I only hear you singing
I am the ticket, you the prize
When begins the winning
It's all we have, the time between us
And no one's been us for a moment
You talk to me just like no other
Like the brother that I never had
I look at you and you will turn and smile
For a little while be happy
I want you with all that loving brings
Like a church bell rings for the morning
You might also likeJust like Josephine
It will not be tonight
Still I have the dream
Still I have the sight
I only see those sad grey eyes
I only hear you singing
I am the ticket, you the prize
When begins the winning
Oh, be my woman and I will be your man
Like I know I can if you let me
Just fill my heart and I will fill your soul
Like I know I can if you let me
"Alexandra" will never sound the same
Not a Roman game, just a feeling
And I will know the time I heard that name
Will never be the same only better
Just like Josephine
It will not be tonight
Still I have the dream
Still I have the sight
I only see those sad grey eyes
I only hear you singing
I am the ticket, you the prize
When begins the winning
I only see those sad grey eyes
I only hear you singing
I am the ticket, you the prize
