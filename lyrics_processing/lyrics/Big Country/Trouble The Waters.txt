Claimed before the judge we didn't pull him very far
Anyway, he looked at us with murder in his glance
We want to make a bargain, and the plea is self defense
Look mother trouble the waters
We've lost our sons and daughters
Blame religion, blame the family
It had to be somebody
Painless violence, daddy's silence
Feed the glamour of drugs and guns
Somebody tell me, you gotta
Who threw the stone to trouble the waters
They took a student farmer and they chained him to a post
And sent their finest greetings with him to the holy ghost
This is a place where men are men and we don't need his kind
We know what he planned for us, we could read his filthy mind
Look mother trouble the waters
We've lost our sons and daughters
Blame religion, blame the family
It had to be somebody
Painless violence, daddy's silence
Feed the glamour of drugs and guns
Somebody tell me, you gotta
Who threw the stone to trouble the waters

Set up like a sniper in that movie that was cool
Someone tripped the fire alarm and panic set about
They looked upon their enemy and calmly took him out
Look mother trouble the waters
We've lost our sons and daughters
Blame religion, blame the family
It had to be somebody
Painless violence, daddy's silence
Feed the glamour of drugs and guns
Somebody tell me, you gotta
Who threw the stone to trouble the waters
Look mother trouble the waters
We've lost our sons and daughters
Blame religion, blame the family
It had to be somebody
Painless violence, daddy's silence
Feed the glamour of drugs and guns
Somebody tell me, you gotta

Who threw the stone that trouble the waters
Who threw that stone
