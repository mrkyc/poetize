A famine in the hills
A rust storm on the northern seas
A dust storm on the skills
Where is the law that holds me
In a grey unpleasant land
I will not dance for the medicine man
With the happy pills at hand
I will pack up my things and go
Head on down to Australia
Just strap on some wings and I'll blow
(Whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my time
(Oh-whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my mind
(Whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my life
(Oh-whoa-whoa-oh)
This is a time for leaving
Whoa-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh
Whoa-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh
You might also likeI will not sing a chain gang song
I will not walk the line
The company store won't have my soul
And I won't have his dime
You could take my job and shove it
If I just had one to give
You could take my pain and love it
But you won't know how I live
I will pack up my things and go
Take a train over Canada
Just tie up my strings and I'll blow
(Whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my time
(Oh-whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my mind
(Whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my life
(Oh-whoa-whoa-oh)
This is a time for leaving
Whoa-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh
Whoa-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh
This is a time for leaving
If I fill my eyes up with the sun
And I hold my face to the blazing sky
My shadow will be cast behind me
And I'll look no more at its beaten eyes
Whoa-whoa-oh, mm-mmm
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh, mm-mmm
Whoa-whoa-oh, mm-mmm
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh
This is a time
(Whoa-whoa-oh)
Listen to the city fall
(Oh-whoa-whoa-oh)
Listen to the warm winds call
(Whoa-whoa-oh)
Listen to me, my love
(Oh-whoa-whoa-oh)
This is a time for leaving
(Whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my time
(Oh-whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my mind
(Whoa-whoa-oh)
Right here in my life
(Oh-whoa-whoa-oh)
This is a time for leaving
Whoa-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh
Whoa-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh
