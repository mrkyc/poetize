I can't give you up, I'm so in love
I will share you with another girl
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
'Cause the taste of your lovin' was everythin'

I know about your girl at home, I know everythin' about you
I know it's her you're goin' to at the end of every night
I can tell you want me and there's somethin' that you're missin'
Otherwise we wouldn't be here huggin' and kissin'

He's got the sex appeal (That turns me on)
When we're talkin' on the phone (I know it's wrong)
No, I can't resist (The way we kickin' it)
I just can't live without him

I can't give you up, I'm so in love
I will share you with another girl
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
'Cause the taste of your lovin' was everythin'
I can't give you up, I'm so in love
I will share you with another girl
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
'Cause the taste of your lovin' was everythin'

Everyday I tell myself that it's time to do the right thing
Gotta walk away before your baby gets to know
But just as I pick up the phone and I start to dial your number
The devil on my shoulder says, "Damn it girl, don't let him know"

He's got the sex appeal (That turns me on)
When we're talkin' on the phone (I know it's wrong)
No, I can't resist (The way we kickin' it)
And I just can't live without him (Without him)

I can't give you up, I'm so in love (I'm so in love)
I will share you with another girl (Oh, baby)
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
'Cause the taste of your lovin' was everythin'
I can't give you up, I'm so in love (I'm so in love)
I will share you with another girl
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
'Cause the taste of your lovin' was everythin'

We can run if you wanna run
We don't have to make a show, never let it show
We can make it if you want, if you really want
I will share you with another girl
We can roll if you wanna roll
We don't have to make a show, never let it show
We can make it if you want, if you really want
I will share you with another girl
I can't give you up, I'm so in love
I will share you with another girl
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
'Cause the taste of your lovin' was everythin'
I can't give you up, I'm so in love
I will share you with another girl
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
'Cause the taste of your lovin' was everythin'
I can't give you up, I'm so in love
I will share you with another girl
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
'Cause the taste of your lovin' was everythin'
I can't give you up, I'm so in love
I will share you with another girl
I swear it's true, I'll do anythin'
