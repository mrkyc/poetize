All this time I've been trying hard to hear you
To understand you, and to console you
I know your life, it's never been that simple
But now's the time to close the circle
To start over again is something scary
I know those bruises in your heart are there forever
But now the time to start again stronger then ever
And show the world in your own way that your never going to go through this again

You know he never loved you, you know he never wanted you
He stabbed you in the back, and he broke your heart in half
But that will make you stronger, no suffering no longer
You'll learn from your mistakes, and there ain't no coming back
Now go enjoy your life, and your gonna laugh so hard
You are never gonna cry once again for a guy
You know he never loved you, you know he never wanted you
But at least you learned somehow

But if now you cannot stop thinking of his love
And his kisses and his caresses
If in the night, can't sleep because you miss him
Just remember the pain you've been through
To start over again is something scary
I know those bruises in your heart are there forever
But now's the time to start again stronger then ever
And show the world in your way that you will never going to go through this again
