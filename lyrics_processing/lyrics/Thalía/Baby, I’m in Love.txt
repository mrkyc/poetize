Baby, I'm in love
Baby, I'm in love

Ah, don't be checkin' me, baby, I ain't free
Maybe on my own but I'm not alone
I got, I got a good thing
Doesn't really matter, boy, what you have
I don't need no rock to be off the block
No more tears you bring gonna change a thing
What we have is so real
You don't need to prove to me how he feels

'Cause I'm in too deep to blow a good thing
And one nice mischief could cost me everythin' I want

'Cause baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I got plans with the one I'm with
And they're a lifetime of bein' true
Maybe in a different place and time
Maybe that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
You might also like
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

It's the cheapest talk and the foolish walk
To be runnin' games and be hidin' things
Behind the one you loves back
Don't be doin' him wrong like that
Yes, it's flatterin' that you're feelin' me
But I got to say that it's all for me
There's nothin' that I will do (nothin' I will do)
To run the risk of losin' him over you

'Cause I'm in too deep to blow a good thing
And one nice mischief could cost me everythin' I want

'Cause baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I got plans with the one I'm with
And they're a lifetime of bein' true
Maybe in a different place and time
Maybe that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

'Cause my heart is taken by the one
That I got and I am gonna prove
That you can trust someone
The one you love

'Cause baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I got plans with the one I'm with
And they're a lifetime of bein' true
Maybe in a different place and time
Maybe that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
Baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
Sorry if you don't approve
I got plans with the one I'm with
And they're a lifetime of bein' true
Maybe in a different place and time
Maybe that I might've changed my mind
But it's like this
Baby, I'm in love with the one I'm with
I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Oh, baby I'm in love with the one I'm with
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Oh, baby I'm in love with the one I'm with
I'm in love, I'm in love
