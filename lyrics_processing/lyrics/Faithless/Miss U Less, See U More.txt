Oh woman

I love the way you're so deliberate
How you light your cigarette
Head on one side as you pull, you look almost regal
I'm digging it, on your mobile, one eye closed
Blue smoke curling out your nose
Wearing one of my shirts and what some call pantyhose
Cause you look wicked in scanty clothes
Long legs like an antelope
You're my antidote to city life, my pretty wife
Hooked up the year before
Together thirteen outta 24
And you would never guess
I wanna miss you less and see you more
See you more, see you more, see you more
And when I kiss you I'm never sure
How do I get to miss you less and see you more?

Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better

Desensitized to my roving eyes, and ready smile
Hmm, I get loving that's versatile
Worth that extra mile lying next to me
Your textured voice whispering
I'm listening with my whole skin
Holding onto the moment for all its worth
How could I continue to be the sky without my earth
And when I kiss you, I'm never sure
And when I kiss you, I'm never sure
And when I kiss you, I'm never sure
How do I get to miss you less and see you more?

Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better

I guess what I'm tryna say is that I

Miss you less, see you more, love to know you better
