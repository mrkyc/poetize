We will again fit together perfectly
So in future lifetimes it's a certainty
We will again fit together perfectly
You're the Sun to me
You're the Sun to me
You're the Sun to me
You're the Sun to me
You're the Sun to me
You're the Sun to me
I stumbled into you accidentally
And yet feels as though you were sent to me
That we were meant to be together and grow with each other
Through the centuries
If my body was your mirror you'd be able to see
Exactly what it is about you that I'm addicted to
Helplessly you distract me like a mountain view of
Rivers crashing into the sea
Strangely, you all seem familiar to me
Hope so, love tie us together through eternity
So in future lifetimes it's a certainty
We will again fit together perfectly
