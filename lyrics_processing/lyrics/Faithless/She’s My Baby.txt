Come to papa
I see you workin' through the bead curtain in the kitchen
Switchin', leavin' me twitchin'
I'm itchin' to be kissin' you
But discipline is the rule
So, I sip my oran' juice and act coo'
She irresistible
We fool around twice a week, she make me weak
Nice when she put her tongue in my cheek
Not petite, baby got a large physique
She take charge, take me where I dare not repeat
I go...  like a hi-hat, plantin' kisses on your back
You like that
Mrs. X, reputation intact
Nobody in my block know we're like down like that
In the next flat but one from where I live with my mum
And Uncle John, he ain't my uncle when it's been far too long
But me and she been goin' strong, almost a year
Wait till the coast is clear, I don't boast for fear of being caught
Maybe we ought to stop, maybe not
For now, my baby gets all I got
Boom! How come we always trash the room?
Grab your clothes 'cause you know someone'll be home soon
And now you see maybe you need to explain gently
Why this mother of three is playin' games with me
She's my baby
(Yeah)
She's my baby

She's my baby
Sweets, my baby
I'm a slave to your outrage
Rocket rocks, stiff shocks, and a roll cage
Colour-coded alloys, much noise, spoilers are poised
Exhaust not an antidote for old age
Yes, yes
Who got the keys to my RS?
We goin' on a road test, hit the M4 and head west
Forever impressed with the sound of my two-liter
We cover ground, engine singin' like Anita Baker
And if I take a corner too quick you get sick
When I do my handbrake trick
Watch me ride, my broadside's wide like a battleship
Side slip, push, on the hip
Stick it in gear and give the gas a flip
It never failed to bring a grin to the lip
Baby's equipped
Me and she gone clear
I got quick rack reduction on my understeer
I been fairly and squarely described as hairy
People say my baby is scary
Look, you pays your money and you takes your choice
I just love to hear my baby's voice
She's my baby
I roll up for the session, everything in position
My friends demonstratin' erudition
I listen for a minute before takin' sides
Sleepy eyes on the limit
Sit down an' spin it
Like we do every Friday 'roun my way
Why play the fool with demon alcohol
As a rule my baby gets passed around
I don't frown, I love to see my friends gettin' down
When it's just me an' she you know it's never precarious
But sharin' with ya buddies is hilarious
Variously we argue an' disagree an' get heated
Hafta tell my people to be seated
An' restart the anti-stress process
Till there's a big mess of twigs an' seeds to meet'cha needs
An' with that first inhaled "Hello"
Guaranteed mellow
