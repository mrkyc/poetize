Uhum...
Like a tweak on your nipple...
Uhum...

Uhum...
Welcome once again to the ceremony
Briefly, this is my testimony
I see genius in everybody
To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty
Where you come from
Really makes no difference to me
Whether country or just another lonely city
Like a lotus
You possess the ability
To produce flower and fruit
Simultaneously

So drop your pebble
In the mainstream
Start a ripple
It will buzz you
Like a tweak on your nipple
Tickle your sensibility
Speak just a little
The words have enough weight
To turn rock to metal

And crazy synchronicity
