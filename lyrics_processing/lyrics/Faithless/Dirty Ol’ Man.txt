I'm a dirty old man The mean streets are home, My life is cold, I'll chill you to the bone
Heart of stone, Have a care, I carry traces of death in my hair
You know my breath stinks, I leave shit everywhere
So be aware I'm unfeeling Don't you dare try appealing to my better nature
You better wait, you're missinformed, Ain't nothing warm about me
Cold and gray, concrete clay and steel, And what else is real? I mean the actual deal
People seem to love living under my hair, Some of them call me London
I'm also known as New York. Anywhere in the world you find me I talk the same bad talk
Walk the same walk from side to side, You're transparent to me
There ain't a thing you can hide, Derive glamour from the stamina it takes to survive
You think I didn't know it's over with your face like a rat
Now give me your cash and go Before you're heart brakes
You're living under my wing And all you got I'm gonna take, I'm a dirty old man
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine
I'm a rough old man beyond heart ache, To improve my mood I could use an earthquake
I sit awake for my people to release the pain, So I can know peace again In my skin
Sin deceit and mistrust soaked in, I think I might just fuss Often drops of woe
Streets flow with tears, I fall down all around your ears
If I could, if I was made of wood start a fire, no lie
I can afford to smoke sacred fire, 'cause I wouldn't bet on people changing just yet
My eyes are wet and my heart is full of fear and regret
