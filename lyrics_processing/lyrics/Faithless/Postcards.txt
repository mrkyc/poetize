My love has gone
His boots no longer by my door
He left at dawn
(Maxi Jazz)
New York, New York
Temperatures dropping
The band's out shopping
Not stopping
Not stopping
'till ears pop
Cops protect shops
Lots of yellow cabs and bell hops
And it never stops
I'm just waiting to do an interview
So much to tell you
Today I felt close enough to smell you
Additional dates they planned and just fell through
Florida's out out, we fly September twenty-two
To Heathrow
So there's not really long to go
Tonight will be a brilliant show
Letting you know, I miss you
More than four hit the floor at a party
Send my love to everybody

Honey I'm writing from D.C
Feeling queasy
Staying healthy on the road isn't easy
The T.M. recommends Sanatogen
One of them could resist taken the...
I miss you like a lock on the door
What's more
I go to sleep with my Walkman cause half the crew snore
Don't mean to be a bore
Everybody's been great
But there's fifteen of us on a bus state to state
So I stay up late
With a tape
Or meditate
My bed is traveling at fifty five M.P.H
When we make it to LA
I'll still be miles away
It's not my best day
I'm ah get some rest
God bless
(Dido)
My love has gone...
My love has gone

We just...
At a dinner so I'm taking time to write a few lines
I'm fine, sunshine
The bus driver's reclining by the grass as the trucks pass
Gleaming with a flash of sunlight from the glass
Of the windscreen
As for us it's too much to relate
We've done five gigs yet we're only in our third state
America's big, you'd love how they pile up your plate
Only place in the world even I can gain weight
Our next gig is Wellington Delaware
Over there, there's a rumor Mel-e-Mel will be there
Anyway, all my love, God bless I'm yawning
I Really miss watching you get dressed in the morning
(Dido)
My love has gone
My love has gone
