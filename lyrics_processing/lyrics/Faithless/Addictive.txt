Predictable behavior, I crave ya
I'm driven, you're my only living savior
Sometimes I hate ya, but I'm whipped
Being led head down to the crypt
Restricted like a conscript you loved to bully
I place the blame with you fully
Change around the words that you said to suit me fine
Make them mine
Listen, don't panic
There's only we two left on the planet
I can explain
I know it happened again
It's manic
I'm standing in the flame trying to fan it
You don't know what you got till it's gone
I'm at the edge of the night where nobody belong
Fingers are drumming
And that's where you come in
And that's where you come
Change around the words that you say to suit me fine
Make them mine
Listen to the voice in your head
It makes no sense, take a rest
(I'm addicted)
I have a demon for a wife
He delights in your pretty face and he hates my life
Takes notes on how to provoke past grief
Makes my teeth decay with the last of my self-belief
Feed all day from underneath like a thief
I'm left weak, barely able to speak
I see nothing but constant supply
I can read every look in your eye
I leave with a lie
Maybe our love will never die
Or, maybe it's the last time I make you cry
Make my appeal like the condemned
Let's go away for the weekend
Your life I will steal
And descend with it into the pit
I'm addicted
Change around the words that you say to suit me fine
(I'm addicted)
Listen to the voice in your head
It makes no sense, take a rest
(I'm addicted)
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I have a little problem
I have a demon for a wife
He delights in your pretty face and he hates my life
Takes notes on how to provoke past grief
Makes my teeth decay with the last of my self-belief
Change around the words that you say to suit me fine
Make them mine
(I'm addicted)
Listen to the voice in your head
It makes no sense, take a rest
(I'm addicted)
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
