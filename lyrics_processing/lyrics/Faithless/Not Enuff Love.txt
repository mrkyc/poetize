And when you lock and bolt the door
Just think of those out in the cold and dark
'Cause there's not enough love to go round
I tell you, wake up
You people need a shake-up
You take up so much time worryin'
Scurryin' here, there
Losin' your hair
No money to spare
No love to share
No wonder you appear under pressure from here
You look fresher
But all I got is dirt in my hair
My nightmares manifest, but I can escape
Yours is in your chest with no form or shape
The tape's running, I push the button to send
Upon each other we all depend
Message end
Whoever asks my name or where I came from?
People fear contamination
If they tarry too long
I carry a strong
Scent of despair
It's in the air
I'm broken and hard to repair
I may mistaken be
But I patiently wait
On the path to humanity
I sit at the gates

My liver in bad condition like my skin
Rain fallin', once again
I'm in my bed, perfect timin'
I'm gonna struggle for air
There's hair in my food
When I get it usually someone already half ate it
I try not to let it get me down
But my head's starting to pound
People go round and round and round
From one I get a cigarette
A little more love found
But the ground is still wet
My teeth are chattering
And there's a smattering of sleet
I sometimes lose all feelin' in my feet
When I sleep I dream I'm deep in the mainstream
But unaccountably my heart has grown small and mean
I hurry past wretched people I pretend I haven't seen
But there's money in my pocket and my clothes are clean
