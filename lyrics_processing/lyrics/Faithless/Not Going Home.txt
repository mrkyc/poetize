I'm not going home till I can take you with me

Come with me
Come with me

A simple tension a run through me chest
My simple intention
Tonight me na rest
'Till I invest these proceedings with vigour and zest
And trigger wetness under your vest
Test your fitness
Special request to my love interest
Impressed
I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress
I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress
I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress

Induce a case of mild madness
Cook it 'till it's black
'Cuz we like it just a tad crisp

Outside the club there's a line o' taxi
I wan ya climb next to me on the back seat
I need your company to relax me
I wanna know just how you come so sexy
That we both here together has profound meaning
I'm so down with you I can feel your breathing
You give me something to believe in
Now kiss me properly and stop your teasing
