Man, I don' have time to was'e with your minions an' ting'."

I see your face in front of me, still grainy
From that old black'n'white TV my whole family silent
Watchin' you shape destiny with your 2 hands
Faster than the eye can see...
Mesmerizing
Y'know what? Skinny lickle me, started to strut, ten years old
Suddenly bold 'cause I resolved to live like my hero in the ring...
Be smart, never give an inch, no retreating
An I wrapped up respect from teachers, rednecks
And creatures who attack in a pack like insects, never
Seen the like, not before or since, A young prince
An I remain convinced of his invincibility, athletic agility
Virility, still a free spirit. Forever through eternity
Stingin' like a bee...
Mr. Muhammad Ali

See Faithless LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like
Your achievements defy belief, from the belly of the beast
Risin' like yeast yo
My release from low self-esteem
Came when I saw you rappin' on my TV screen, float
Like a butterfly that describe my walk to school
After fight night, I felt so cool
'Cause I was the greatest, too
Love of self born simply out of love for you
An I knew someday people'll love me too
None of the hecklin' about my black skin got through
I woulda walked barefoot through hell for you
It's how I felt back then an I still do so will you
Accept these humble words of praise
And my gratitude for those glorious days
And meritorious ways instilled in a young mind
Skills sublime
Yours to mine
