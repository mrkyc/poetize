Check, 1738

I'm like, she got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, watch what you say
Put that cake in my face
I'm like she got cake though
Cake though, she got cake though
Look how it's moving, I'm swerving
Up in the corners, I'm getting to it
Bands though, I'm throwing bands though
I'm throwing mula
Touch mine, get your top popped
I'm a shooter
Beamer, with the top dropped
I'm a cruiser
Remy Boyz, that is my squad
It's a movement
Rob me? Nigga, haha
You're a loser
Your bitch got a fat ass
I'ma do her
Hulk smash, fuck her brains out
Knock the screws loose
Backwards, rolling backwards
I'm a guru
What I like, I'm Slick Rick
I'm a ruler
Rookie, on this rap shit, I can school you

Let me see you drop with it, do a little dip
And when the booty shorts on, she be looking thick
Ex nigga was lame, kept cumming quick
