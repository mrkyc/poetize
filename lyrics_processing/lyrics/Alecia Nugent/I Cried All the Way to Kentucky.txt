I did what we all did, I sat down and cried
Got into my car, headed home for the hills
Back home to Kentucky where the funeral was held
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
The Preacher said Joe was a wonderful guy
And God has a project for him in the sky
His stories are binging the Angels a smile
To turn us into new ways to cheer us awhile
Joe once brought a skunk into Sunday School class
Had even made grouchy old Deacon Jones laugh
He says it's been fixed and smells like a rose
All of you good christians turn loose of your nose
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back

When the outhouse was purched upon Grandpa's old barn
I think of those things when I tell Joe goodbye
A smile on my lips and a tear in my eye
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
I cried all the way to Kentucky
