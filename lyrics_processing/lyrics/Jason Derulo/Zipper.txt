Shawty, I'm an animal, slowly digging into you
Spread you like a bad story
Turn you to a criminal, let me see you cock it back
Bang, bang, bang on it
'Til the headboard break, make me think that I wanna put a ring on you
Uh, but first I'll make you sing for me
And all the ladies say

I-I-I-I-I-I-I wanna ride-ide-ide-ide-ide

Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper, zipper

Haha, I could be sweet, lady or eat it like a cannibal
Go places that you may can't go
In my back seat, baby
Uh, you're smoking like some good good, once I hit that good good
Make me beg, beg for it
Uh, mama taught you well 'cause it ain't about booty but the brain, baby
Haha, now let me hear you sing to me
And all them ladies say
