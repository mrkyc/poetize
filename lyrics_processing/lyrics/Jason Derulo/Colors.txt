Oh, what a feeling
Look what we've overcome
Oh, I'm gonna wave-a-wave my flag
And count all the reasons
We are the champions
There ain't no turning, turning back

Saying "Oh, can't you taste the feeling, feeling"
Saying "Oh, we all together singing"

Look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
There's beauty in the unity we've found
I'm ready, I'm ready
We still got a long way
But look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
Hands up for your colors
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ready the people
A new day has just begun
And I wear my colors on my back (celebrate, celebrate)
We're created equal
One race, and that's human
Can't wait til they all see, all see dat
