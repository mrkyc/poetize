Oh, woah, oh
Yeah, yeah

I only miss you when I'm breathing (uh)
I only need you when my heart is beating
You are the color that I'm bleeding (uh)
I only miss you when I'm breathing
This ain't no ordinary feeling
You are the only thing that I believe in
I know you're coming back to me, and
I will be waiting here for you 'til the end

I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing)
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing)
Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive
I only miss you when I'm breathing
Woo
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh

I wanna see pictures of you leaning
On these four walls and on the ceiling
Gave you a kiss, but I'm dreaming
These crazy thoughts are so deceiving
You are the drug, I am feining
Paradise that I'm still seeking
I'm still alive, hope there's a reason
Can't move my lips, but my heart is screaming

So sound the alarm
Tell everyone that I only miss you
