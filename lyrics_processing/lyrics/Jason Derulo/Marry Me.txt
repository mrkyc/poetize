Ooh, oh
Oh, yeah, mm

A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do

And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love, so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
Singing, oh-woah
Ooh, oh-woah
Ooh-woah
Oh, yeah

How many girls in the world could make me feel like this?
Baby, I don't ever plan to find out
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life

But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough

I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?"

And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
'Cause I have you, girl, I have you
To get right down on bended knee
Nothing else would ever be better, better
The day when I

I'll say, "Will you marry me?"
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?" (Yeah)
I'll say, "Will you marry me?" (The day I get on my knees)
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say, "Will you marry me?" (And what you do to me, baby)
Got me singing, ooh-woah
Got me singing, ooh-woah
Would you marry me, baby? Ooh-woah
Ooh-woah (Ay)
Ooh-woah (Yeah)
A hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
