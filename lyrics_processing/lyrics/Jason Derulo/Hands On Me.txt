Baby, put your hands on me
Hey, woo
Ooh, hey, yeah
You got that bomb, baby

She was, she was, she was, she was the girl next door, that's my fine-ass neighbor (Uh-huh)
Told her if she wants some sugar, baby, don't be a stranger (Uh-huh)
And she said, "When I need somethin' sweet, I'll be comin' over to you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Haha, that girl was knockin', knockin', knockin' in the middle of the night
Wearin' nothin' but a robe that she took off inside
'Cause she said, "Boy, I'm gettin' cold, here's what I need you to do"

Baby, put your hands (Hands) on me (On me)
Both hands (Hands) on me (On me)
Right now (Right now), you're the only (You're the only) one I need
So, baby, put your hands (Hands) on me (On me)
Both hands (Hands) on me (On me)
When we dance (We dance), put your hands all over me (Hey)
Alright, say

Been such a long time since I'd been lucky
Don't have to be shy, say how bad you want me
Come and touch me tenderly (Tenderly)
So come and give me that body heat, I want your body heat on me
I can barely sleep, I'm tryna turn up the degrees
With you all over me
