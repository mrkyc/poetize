Never thought that I'd say
I wish I didn't love you ever since the first date
When you got close, my heart would just stop
Thought me and you together would end up on top
You changed me for better, for worse
I know I was caught up, always put you first
I never once thought you would be trifling
But oh, I was blinded

I was like (Oh, oh, oh)
Never wanna let you (Go, go, go)
I was open before (Had me open before)
But now I know

Love made me blind, so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind

I gave all of my trust
Didn't think being faithful was asking too much
But I'm good, glad that I know now
I was fooled but fate let me see how
They say every tear has its reasons
Every smile has its own season
Never once thought you would be trifling
But oh, I was blinded

I was like (Oh, oh, oh)
Never wanna let you (Go, go, go)
I was open before (Had me open before)
But now I know

Love made me blind, so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)

'Cause when I, I felt your lips pressed against mine
Thought the sweet smell of your perfume was all mine
Didn't know you were a beautiful liar
'Cause love made me blind

Love made me blind, so I couldn't see (So I couldn't see)
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
