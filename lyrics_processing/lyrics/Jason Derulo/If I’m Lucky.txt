Woo, who are you to say, that I didn't love you?
'Cause I didn't love the way you wanted
And who am I to blame? When I didn't trust you
Enough to let you in the way I wanted, stop, okay

Vodka on my lips (yeah, yeah), took too many drinks (yeah, yeah)
Makes me reminisce all the way down (woo)
To my happy place (yeah, yeah), you're my happy place (yeah, yeah)
I can't handle us now

If I'm lucky I'll meet ya, flipside of the graveyard
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday
If I'm lucky, I'll meet ya, heaven or high water
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe
If I'm lucky, eh
If I'm lucky, eh
Uh, I'll get your loving (yeah)
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday

Who am I to say, that it wasn't good, babe? Mmmm
Just thinkin' 'bout our loving gives me chills
Up and down my spine, uh, I dare you not to miss me, yeah
'Cause what we had was more than just a thrill, stop, okay
