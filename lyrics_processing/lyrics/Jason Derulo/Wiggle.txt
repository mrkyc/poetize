Haha, I got one question
Haha, how do you fit, all that

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bittle
Swing!

Got me in this club, making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance (Do your dance)
I could make you famous on Instagram

Hot dammit (Woo!)
Your booty like two planets (Woo!)
Go 'head and go ham sandwich (Woo!)
Woah, I can't stand it

Shake what your mama gave you, misbehave you
I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bathe you
What they do, taste my raindrops, 'kay, boo?
Now what you're willing, what you wanting, what you may do
Completely separated 'til I deeply penetrate it
Then I take it out and wipe it off, eat it, ate it, love it, hate it
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been
Can you wiggle, wiggle for the D-O-double G again?

Come on, baby, turn around
(Turn around, turn around, turn around) (Yeah)
You're a star, girl, take a bow
(Take a bow, take a bow, take a bow) (Haha, yeah)

Just a little bittle (Oh, woah; Little bittle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Now make it clap (Love it when you do it like that)
Just a little bittle (No hands, baby, make it clap, clap, clap, like)
Now make it clap, clap, clap
Swing!
