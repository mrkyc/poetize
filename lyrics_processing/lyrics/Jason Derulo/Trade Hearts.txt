You say I don't have any time to try and keep you satisfied
I call you crazy all the time
You say I'm so damn difficult, and I save it with, "You're beautiful"
You're tired of hearing the same lines
(So I cry, cry, and you don't know why, why)

So I, I, I, I, I, I wish I could trade hearts with you (with you)
So I, I, I, I, I, I can feel the same way you do, you do

Hey, can you teach me cynical? I hope it's not too difficult
Don't tell me I'm incapable, mmm
'Cause I wanna scream the way you scream, I wanna bleed the way you bleed
But you only get half of me
(So you cry, oh yeah, you cry, and I don't know why, baby, why)

So I, I, I, I, I, I wish I could trade hearts with you (I)
So I, I, I, I, I, I can feel the same way you do
'Cause there's some things I just don't understand
Like how hard a woman loves a man
So I, I, I, I, I, I, so I, I, I, I, I, I wish I could trade hearts with you, with you, with you

Touch me 'til I feel your love on mine
Touch me, love me, now like it's me that's cryin'
Touch me 'til I feel your love onmine, oh (I will)
Baby, I swear that I'm tryin'
