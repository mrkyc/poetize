Hey, girl, I know this shit might sound crazy
Before you get in bed, throw on those heels
Hey, girl, now I know why you waited
Had to be sure that I was worth the thrill
Ladies come and go but you got something different
Had me so addicted from the start
And I'd never known all this loving I'd be missing
If I didn't work my way into your heart

You give me vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen, don't really matter long as I get
Vertigo, vertigo
On top, on bottom, inside of the bed, baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool (Cool)
That I'm stuck on you (You)
Like your birthday suit (Suit)
You give me vertigo, that vertigo

The way that you please me sets this room on fire
I'm burning with desire in this bed
So if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up
If all of this is happening in my head
Waited for so long, but what you got is different (Different)
Had me so addicted from the start
Boy, I'd never known all the shit that I was missing (Missing)
If I hadn't worked my way into your heart

Like your birthday suit (Suit)
You give me vertigo (Vertigo), that vertigo

I'm working downtown, you all in my head
This love that we found, we'll never regret
Was empty inside
I'm filling you up with our vertigo
You waking me up (Yeah), to my fantasy
Right here in this bed, we stay here all day
And my head be spinning
You do it to me with our vertigo

You give me vertigo, vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen, don't really matter long as I get (long as I get)
Vertigo, vertigo, vertigo
On top, on bottom, inside of the bed, baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool (Cool)
That I'm stuck on you (You)
Like your birthday suit (Suit) (Suit)
You give me vertigo, that vertigo, vertigo
Say you give me, oh
Vertigo, vertigo
Baby, oh

Say you give me, oh
