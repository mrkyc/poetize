I been looking under rocks and breaking locks
Just tryna find ya
I been like a maniac, insomniac
Five steps behind ya
Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit, check please
'Cause I finally found the girl of my dreams
Much more than a Grammy award
That's how much you mean to me

You can be my it girl, baby, you the shit, girl
Loving you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit, girl, this is it, girl
Give me 25 to life
I just wanna rock, all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it, girl, you're my biggest hit, girl
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
