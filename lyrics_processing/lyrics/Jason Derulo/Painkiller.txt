M Train, Jason Derulo, true

I thought my heart might break 'cause slowly this kills
Not everyone needs space (Oh no)
You what the doctor gave? I swallowed the pill
I never loved this way (Oh no)

You pick me up and get me higher (Higher)
You fill my cup with desire

Baby, I'm back now, feelin' how I used to feel
You got me back now, stick around, this is for reals
You put it do-do-do-down, my painkiller
You put it do-do-do-down, my painkiller
Baby, I'm back now, feelin' how I used to feel
You got me back now, stick around, this is for reals
You put it down
You put it down

I had to turn the page to get here to you
Love how you numb my pain (Oh yeah)
But all the nurses say, "Beware of the juice
That makes you go insane" (Oh yeah)
