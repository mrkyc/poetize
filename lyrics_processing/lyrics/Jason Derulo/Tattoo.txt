Who's more desperate?
You're on your knees boo
But when you fuck up
I don't leave you, uh, I can't leave you, yeah
Guess you're permanent
Can't be removed
Each time my heart breaks
It's like a new tattoo, don't need a new tattoo, woah

One touch always makes me
Too hard to escape
Three strikes, I'm still yours
What am I waiting for?

I'm running out of room
Or your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
So don't tell me it's cool
That I'm tattooed
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
Yeah, yeah

Why do we stay
When only fools would?
I guess we're both fools
'Cause the sex is good, it's way too good, yeah
Call us crazy, misunderstood
'Cause I can't leave you
And I know I should
People say I should, uh

But one touch always makes me
Too hard to escape
Three strikes, I'm still yours
What am I waiting for?

I'm running out of room
Or your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
So don't tell me it's cool (Cool)
That I'm tattooed (Tattooed)
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
Yeah, yeah
Permanently trying to hide, the scars we can't remove
You're drawn on me and I'm still drawn to you

I'm running out of room (Running)
For your tattoos
How can I get over you, over you (How can I get over you, over you?)
When you're all over me?
So don't tell me it's cool (So don't you tell me, cool)
That I'm tattooed (Tattooed)
How can I get over you, over you
When you're all over me?
