Crazy nights we share, bottles everywhere
Drunk but we don't care, don't care, yeah
Jeans are on the floor, "Privacy" on the door
I still want you more, you more, yeah

Put your phone away, making love for days, baby

If I asked you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed again
Yeah, pull the sheets right over and
Kiss your body in your favorite place
Baby, we can take our time
We gon' have tonight for the rest of our life
Life, oh, oh, oh, oh
Life, oh, oh, oh, oh (the rest of our live)
Life, oh, oh, oh, oh (oh, yeah)
Life, oh, oh, oh, oh
