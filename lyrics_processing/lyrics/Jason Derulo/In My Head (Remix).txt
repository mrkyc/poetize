Everybody's looking for love, oh (Woo, huh)
Ain't that the reason you're at this club? Oh (Huh)
You ain't gon' find it dancing with him, no (No)
I got a better solution for you, girl, oh (Huh)

Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (And we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (You the ropes)
You'll see the side of love you'd never known
I can see it goin' down, goin' down

In my head, I see you all over me
