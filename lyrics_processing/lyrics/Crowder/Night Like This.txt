If you've ever been gone then ran back home
Make you sing freedom songs 'til the break of dawn
We ain't singin' 'bout good, ain't singin' 'bout bad
We're singin' 'bout life back from the dead

Have you ever seen a sunshine
Comin' up in the morning?

Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
Music as loud as me and my friends
On a Saturday night that ain't ever gonna end
Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better, better
Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better, better
Ain't nothin' better than a night like this

If you've heard your name been called out loud
Like Lazarus come back from the ground
We ain't singin' 'bout good, ain't singin' 'bout bad
We're singin' 'cause we're alive and ain't dead

Have you ever seen a sunrise
On an Easter morning?
On an Easter morning?

Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
Music as loud as me and my friends
On a Saturday night that ain't ever gonna end
Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better, better
Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better, better

And it's only gonna get better than this
I can only imagine what comes next

Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
Music as loud as a church house gets
On a Sunday night that ain't ever gonna end
Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better than a night like this
Music as loud as me and my friends
On a Sunday night that ain't ever gonna end
Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better, better
Ain't nothin' better than a night like this
No, there ain't nothin' better, better
