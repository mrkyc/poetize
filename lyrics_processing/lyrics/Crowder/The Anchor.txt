For anyone battered
For any heart shattered
For anyone sinking down
Hold on, hold on
For all the sinners
For the weary and weathered
Thrown and tossed, hope is lost
Hold on, hold on

There's an anchor in the rage of the storm
When the walls are closing in, in the darkness all alone
Just praying for the daylight, peace for the soul
There's grace for the morning when you feel like letting go

There's an anchor
There's an anchor

To all who have faltered
There is an altar
Bring your plea on bended knee
Bow down, bow down
All you sons and daughters
Run to the father
You're not to far from opened arms
Come home, come home

Oh, there is an anchor (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
There's an anchor (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Ooh, there's an anchor, ooh-oh (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
There is an anchor, ooh (Oh-oh-oh), oh

With just a touch, You calm me
Just a whisper, You love me
Without judgment You hold me
No one ever has known me
You made me

There's an anchor (Oh-oh-oh)
Holding time in His hands (Oh-oh-oh)
A rock you can stand on (Oh-oh-oh)
A mercy without end (Oh-oh-oh)
Ooh, Love that's eternal (Oh-oh-oh)
Bore up all our sins (Oh-oh-oh)
A King that is coming (Oh-oh-oh)
The Great I AM (Oh-oh-oh)
