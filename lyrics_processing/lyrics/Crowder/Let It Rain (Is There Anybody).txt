Is there anybody's sunshine
Been turned to rain?
Is there anybody's blue sky
Been turned to gray?

Is there anybody's good time
Turned out real bad?
Is there anyone's happiness
Turned out sad?

And I know I can't trust in the things that I see
In the things that I see
All I know, He's at work and He's working on me
He's working on me

So let it rain, let it pour
Lord, I need You more and more
Let it rain, rain down on me
Every day, whatever You want
Not my will but Yours, Lord
Let it rain, rain down on me

He's done it for me
