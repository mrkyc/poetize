We're not afraid
Terrors of night, arrows that fly by day
Ten thousand may fall but we
We will remain

We're not afraid
A promise of God can never be torn away
Walking on hands of angels, crushing snakes
Safe under the shadow of His wings
Our fortress and our strength
Our fortress

We're taking back our freedom
Our battle has been won
We have been liberated
Back from the dead we've come
We're taking back our freedom
Our battle has been won
We have been liberated
Back from the dead we've come

We're not afraid
A promise of God can never be torn away
Walking on hands of angels, crushing snakes
Safe under the shadow of His wings
Our fortress and our strength
Our fortress

Champion of all creation?
Eyes of fire, voice of thunder
Tearing through the sky in wonder
Dressed in light, we see Him coming
On a horse that's white like lightning
