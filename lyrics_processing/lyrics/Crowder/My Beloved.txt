In my soul, in my soul

There's a sun, coming up
In my soul, Lord, in my soul
There's a sun coming up
In my soul, Lord, in my soul

I see the light, I see the light
I see the light, I see the light
Oh, thank You, God, I see the light

My Beloved, bring me awake
Take me up to Your resurrection place
My Beloved, bring me awake
Cause I wanna feel Your light on my face

There's a sun, coming up
In my soul, Lord, in my soul
There's a sun coming up
In my soul, Lord, in my soul
