I'm headed to a place where the rivers flow
I'm headed to a place where the streets are gold
Oh, my soul (Oh, my soul)
This I know (This I know)

You won't need no money, you can't bring your fame
Soon the day is coming when we will see His face

Choirs will be singing, saints on bended knee
Angels will be dancing, we will all be free
God in all His glory as far as you can see
It's like every day is Sunday in the land of milk and honey

I'm headed to a place where the flowers grow
I'm headed to a place with no tombstones
Sing my soul (Sing my soul)
Until I'm home (Until I'm home)

You can bring your money, you can bring your fame
Forever there is only, one name above all names

It's like every day is Sunday in the land of milk and honey

We don't have to wait 'til the other side
To see the dead come back to life
We don't have to wait 'til the trumpets sound
We're calling down Your power now
We don't have to wait 'til the other side
To see the dead come back to life
We don't have to wait 'til the trumpets sound
We're calling down Your power now
Grass growing in the graveyards
Spring on up, spring on up
Water flowing in the wastelands
Let it run, let it run
Hope growing where there was none
Love flowing where the hate was
Promised land waiting on us
Kingdom come, Kingdom come

Choirs will be singing, saints on bended knee
Angels will be dancing, we will all be free
God in all His glory as far as you can see
It's like every day is Sunday in the land of milk and honey
