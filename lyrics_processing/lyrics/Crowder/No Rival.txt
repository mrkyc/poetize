He is justice
He is mercy
He is spotless
Yet carried me dirty
He is jealous and gracious
Pursuant and patient
Always been brutally kind
He is gentle
But you can't tame Him

There is no one (No one)
No one (No one)
No one like Jesus
He has (He has)
He has (He has)
No rival
No one (No one)
No one (No one)
No one like Jesus
He has (He has)
He has (He has)
No equal

He's a king
He's a servant
Voice of thunder
I hear Him whisper
He gives beauty for ashes
Gave His life in compassion
Always, we've been on His mind
He was buried
But Hell couldn't hold Him

My whole life, I heard 'em say
"You ain't ever gonna make it boy"
Stop, replay
Them kinda words change the way I pray
No more "God is good, God is great"
I've been down before, I mean real low
But don't judge my past, we all friends though
Forgiveness was the key I was missin' bro
But my God is big, Jericho
So I stand with my fist held high
And my eyes gazed on the Most High
Lord, pour out Your love and Your glory
I know You supporting me, You the authority
I'm right where I'm supposed to be, You have a plan for me
Hope and a future, You said it so candidly
So as day after day goes by when y'all ask me to testify
I point my hands to the sky, my God
There is no one (No one)
No one (No one)
(I point my hands to the sky, my God)
No one like Jesus
He has (He has)
He has (He has)
No rival (No rival)
No one (No one) (No one like)
No one (No one) (No one like)
No one like Jesus
He has (He has)
He has (He has) (He has me)
