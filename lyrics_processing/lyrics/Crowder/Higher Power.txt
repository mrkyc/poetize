My people Sunday morning
They ain't just filled, they pouring
They cup is overflowing
My people, all God's people
My people got no worries
Faith never in a hurry
My people made for glory
My people, all God's people

Never going down when He's on our side
Never going down

We on that higher power
We lions, not cowards
Put your robe on, we the choir
We champions, throw the flowers
Higher power
We stronger, we louder
Put your robe on, we the choir
We champions, throw the flowers

They praising floor to the ceiling
They thankful for that freedom

We champions, throw the flowers
Higher power
We stronger, we louder
Put your robe on, we the choir
We champions, throw the flowers

Heard folks saying, "There ain't nothing on the flip side"
But we came to flex the power on the inside
We was down in the mud, ain't know how to stand
Washed clean from the ways we was lost in (Woah)
Look higher (Higher)
He for the people (People) in the fire (In the fire)
I know we seen so many things, but You still our desire
Went so many ways, but You still our provider
I hear the whole band drumming
Stop the whole thing 'cause the King gon' be coming (Gon' be coming)
Ayy, King gon' be coming
The beginning of forever and the end of time
This a new life for us, we on God's side, yeah
We on that higher power
We lions, not cowards
Put your robe on, we the choir
We champions, throw the flowers
Higher power
We stronger, we louder
Put your robe on, we the choir
We champions, throw the flowers

Higher power
