That devil keep calling, calling me back
O Lord I'm crying, I need Your help
Keep me from trouble
Keep me from hell
Lord keep me walkin', walkin', walkin'
Lord keep me

This road is narrow the way is steep
I try to follow, but I can barely see
Left, right, Lord I try to walk this walk to fight this fight
You keep on tellin' me you're not afraid of me
But I can tell by the way that you look at me
Always the little ones
With the fight in 'em you're not one of 'em
Walking around with your J's on the ground
Look at the sky, follow my eyes
I'm gonna fly leave you behind
I'm gonna fly leave you behind

That devil keep calling, calling me back
O Lord I'm crying, I need Your help
Keep me from trouble
Keep me from hell
Lord keep me walkin', walkin'
Lord keep me walkin'
Lord keep me walkin'
Lord keep me walkin'
Lord keep me walkin', walkin', walkin'

My spirit's willing, my flesh is weak
I beg for healing, Lord I'm on my knees
Wrong, right, You know I try
To walk this walk to fight this fight
I've been washed in the blood, drawn in the flood
Covered and clean like a winter white scene
Tell you right now, you got nothing on me so run devil run (run devil run
Eyes on the sun, ain't goin' back
I'm in the Son ain't gonna crack
I'm gonna fly leave you behind
I'm gonna fly leave you behind

That devil keep calling, calling me back
O Lord I'm crying, I need Your help
Keep me from trouble
Keep me from hell
Lord keep me walkin', walkin'
Lord keep me walkin'
Lord keep me walkin'
Lord keep me walkin'
Lord keep me walkin', walkin', walkin'

No matter how far I've gone or will go
You keep on calling me, calling me home
No matter how far I've run or will
Roam
You keep on calling me, calling me home
