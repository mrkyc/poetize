When evil roars and the darkness rails
When night's so long, when everything you tried has failed
There is still return, there is still something pure
There is still love, there is the sinner's cure

When all the hope you thought you knew you had
Runs out with the dreams of everything
You thought you'd be by now, you should be free by now
You're screaming out while the world spins 'round
You thought somebody woulda noticed by now
But when you've reached the end, there's the sinner's cure

The sinner's cure
And the blood ran down
The sinner's cure
And the blood ran down
The sinner's cure
And the blood ran down
The sinner's cure
And the blood ran

Why did God kill his Son?
Was it something I said, or something I done?
Why there have to be death when He's supposed to be love? Oh
Was it just me or was it bigger than we?
How you get what you need when you need glory
The King of Kings got no needs, already got victory

You ever felt lonely and see the night sky
And think what am I? Why am I here? Why am I even here?
Is there not one true thing? Is there not one thing true?
While You were dying for me I was dying for you
While You were dying for me I was dying for you

The sinner's cure
(The sinner's cure)
The sinner's cure
And the blood ran down
(To live for glory and it's all Yours)
The sinner's cure
And the blood ran down
(All I need is the sinner's cure)
The sinner's cure
And the blood ran down
(To live for glory and it's all Yours)
The sinner's cure
(All I need is the sinner's cure)
And the blood ran
And the blood ran down
