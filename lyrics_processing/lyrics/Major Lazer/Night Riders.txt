Word
Straight up
Outlaw, outlaw, like I hit the PowerBall
Once all eyes is on me, floatin' off like Southpaw
Niggas love to count yours, hoping that your paper fall
Wishing death upon me, but I'm here forevermore (Straight up!)

Saint Laurent on speed dial, I just put the latest on
Bring it on, bring it on, you want war, then bring it on
Set this bitch on fire, nigga, we can have a sing-along

Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is the gas and the lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
