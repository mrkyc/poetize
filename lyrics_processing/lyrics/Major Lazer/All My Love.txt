Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder? (Major Lazer)
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops

All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

You're always on my mind
Oh, there'll come a day
Day where we can fly
Reach the glory haze, oh, hey
High up in the sun in the brighter sky
Sun in the brighter sky

Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops
