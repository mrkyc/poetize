Falls, the light, by your side
And flows to a sea of lost dreams
The ocean opens its arms to lost souls
Toils the night, so it seems
And who can recall the lost faith there
The distant look in your eyes
Spanish guitars and night plazas
In a park you can hear lovers cry

Here where the children are singing
I kissed the sleep on your brow
Here where the children are weeping
I held you 'til your heart became mine

Somewhere deep in the midnight
Night birds sent out their calls
Somewhere far from the madness
Shadows of leaves touch the walls
And you taught me to dance with the heartbreak
Of those who cast on with their woes
Showed me to love in the darkness
The visit it comes and it goes

I held you 'til your heart became mine
