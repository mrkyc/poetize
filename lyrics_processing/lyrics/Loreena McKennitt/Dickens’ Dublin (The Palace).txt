I walk the streets of Dublin town
It's Eighteen Forty-two
It's snowing on this Christmas eve
Think I'll beg another bob or two
I'll huddle in this doorway here
'til someone comes along
If the lamp lighter comes real soon
Maybe I'll go home with him

Maybe I can find a place I can call my home
Maybe I can find a home I can call my own
These three wise kings and they were all from different countries. and they always used to look up in the sky, and they looked up in this night and saw the beautiful star up in the sky,  and when they were all going they all meeted together, and they had to pass King Herod's not that we much care for him, and they went in and he said "where ye going with your best stitches on ye?"
The horses on the cobbled stones pass by
Think I'll get one one fine day
And ride into the country side
And very far away
But now as the daylight disappears
I best find a place to sleep
Think I'll slip into the bell tower
In the church just down the street

And they said "did ye not hear the news?" and says he says "what news?" he says "this day the saviour is born." and he said to them "when you find him come back and tell me 'cause i want to go and adore him too." and he was only codding them he wanted to kill him. and they when they were going they stopped and they said "surely not this old stable that the king is born in? we was expecting a palace."
Maybe on the way I'll find the dog
I saw the other night
And tuck him underneath my jacket
So we'll stay warm through the night
As we lie in the bell tower high
And dream of days to come
The bells overhead will call the hour
The day we will find a home

Maybe I can find a place I can call my home
Maybe I can find a home I can call my own

Maybe I can find a place I can call my home
Maybe I can find a home I can call my own
