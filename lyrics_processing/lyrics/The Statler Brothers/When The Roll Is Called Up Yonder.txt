And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder)
When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there
On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of His resurrection share
When His chosen ones are gathered to their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder)
When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there
You might also likeLet us labor for the Master from the dawn 'til setting sun
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care
Then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder)
When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there)
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder)
When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there
