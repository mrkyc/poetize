From the good book we know
A story 'bout a miracle
That happened long ago
We hope that you'll take courage
When temptation you meet
There's somebody watching you
Who's strong when you're weak
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
Now the prophet Danial tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king demanded them
Bound and thrown
In the firey furnace that day
But the fire was so hot
That the men were slain
Who forced them on their way
You might also likeNow when the few were thrown in
And the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
And in astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of that fire
Well though I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walking down there
There's Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
An' the fiery coals they trod
And the form of the fourth man
That I see is like the Son of God
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
