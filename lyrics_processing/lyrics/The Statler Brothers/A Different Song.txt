To the cold winds that chilled my very soul
And I've sung everything from lonely nights in taverns
To dime store women on the troll
And I've sung everything from sunshine to sadness
From the good life to the hells of Bob McVee
Now I sing a different song and tell a different story
'Cause Jesus sang a different song to me
Chorus:
And he said he'd meet me (Meet me in the mornin')
In the mornin' (Meet me in the mornin')
In the sweet still shadows of his love (of his love)
He said he'd meet me (Meet me in the mornin')
In the mornin' (Meet me in the mornin')
In the warm soft goodness of his love
I've read it in the pages of
Matthew, Mark and Proverbs, Daniel, Revelation, Timothy
And the wisdom I discovered from cover to cover
Was enough to scare the Devil out of me
The words all have reason
And they're never out of season
They're the sweetest written words you'll ever hear
Since I've been readin' Jesus
I read a different story
'Cause Jesus, he's been readin' me for years
