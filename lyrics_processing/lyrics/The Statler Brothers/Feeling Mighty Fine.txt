I woke up this morning feeling fine
I woke up with heaven on my mind
I woke up with joy in my soul
'Cause I knew my Lord had control
I knew I was walkin' in the light
'Cause I'd been on my knees in the night
And then I prayed 'til the Lord gave a sign
And now I'm feeling mighty fine

Well, I'm feeling mighty fine (Feeling mighty fine, feeling mighty fine)
I've got heaven on my mind (Heaven on my mind, heaven on my mind)
Don't you know I wanna (Don't you know, I wanna go)
Where the milk and honey flow (Milk and honey flow, flow)
There's a light that always shines (A light that always shines, a light that always shines)
Down inside this heart of mine (In this heart of mine, in this heart of mine)
I've got heaven, heaven on my mind (Heaven on my mind, heaven on my mind)
And I'm feeling mighty fine (Feeling mighty fine, yes, I'm feeling fine)

We're walking with Jesus all the time
We're walking and talking as we climb
We're traveling a road to the sky
Where I know I'll live when I die
He's been telling me all about that land
And He tells me that everything is grand
And He says that a home will be mine
And now I'm feeling mighty fine
