It's not enough
Sometimes I feel like I just can't catch up
When all I've done is wrong to you
I've given up
I've let you down
Over and over you have stood your ground
You care for me, I don't know why

I've caused those tears in your eyes
I've caused the pain in your heart
I took the joy from your life
Your sunshine away
And now I'm falling apart
The sun was down
I hide my eyes
I've broken your heart now too many times
And all I can do is just ask why
My head in my hand
You're at the door
Why am I so foolish like I've been before
I push away, I don't know why
You might also like
I've caused those tears in your eyes
I've caused the pain in your heart
I took the joy from your life
Your sunshine away
And now I'm falling apart

I know we'll both make it through
I know we'll do what it takes
I know the sun will come up
There's a break in the clouds
Let's wash those tears all away

And we both stood there
Your hand in my hand
I looked at you, you looked at me
We made our promises there
Our friends and family
Will always be there
I know the best is yet to come
I know this will take some time
The joy in your eyes
Was never ceasing
I knew you'd be there 'till the end
I caused those tears in your eyes
I caused the pain in your heart
I took the joy from your life
Your sunshine away
And now I'm falling apart

I know we'll both make it through
I know we'll do what it takes
I know the sun will come up
There's a break in the clouds
Let's wash those tears all away

I'm turning around
I know we'll both be OK
The sun's coming out
