Don't blame my mother for holding my hand up the hill
Don't blame my childhood friends for speaking their minds
I'll take it all, yeah I'll take it all I will
If I was to fight would you fight against me
If I was to run would you run with me
If I was to die would you bury me deep
Saying world please
And if I was to scream would you hear what I said
If I was to drown would you hold my hand
Underneath the memories of what I meant
And not what I did
I built a house so tall and I burned it down
I was looking for culture to find what was already found
But don't blame America, blame it on me
I'm w0rried that the sins of the father will trickle down
If I was to fight would you fight against me
If I was to run would you run with me
If I was to die would you bury me deep
Saying world please
And if I was to scream would you hear what I said
If I was to drown would you hold my hand
Underneath the memories of what I meant
And not what I did

Don't say my lord was up there being unkind
'Cause if justice is a trick you know we all could hide
I'll take it all, yeah I'll take it all this time
If I was to fight would you fight against me
If I was to run would you run with me
If I was to die would you bury me deep
Saying world please
And if I was to scream would you hear what I said
If I was to drown would you hold my hand
Underneath the memories of what I meant
