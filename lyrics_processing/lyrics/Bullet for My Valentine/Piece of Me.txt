Give me a reason
Give me a reason
Why I should give a fuck!

Give me a reason
Why I should give a fuck
You lost my sympathy
You lack that human touch
Too many secrets
Too many past mistakes
Discolored memories
Stained by your fall from grace

You lost my sympathy
Another whisper
Another heart to break
Stained by your fall from grace

Let it sink, don't swim
I was in too deep
But I can't let you take another piece of me
You can break me down little bit by bit
But I won't let you keep another piece of me
You might also like
So tell me something
Why should I stitch these cuts?
You brought me misery
You took my confidence
Too many bruises
Too many hits to take
A broken promise
Another scar to make

You brought me misery
Another whisper
Another heart to break
Too many hits to take
Another scar to make

Let it sink, don't swim
I was in too deep
But I can't let you take another piece of me
You can break me down little bit by bit
But I won't let you keep another piece of me

Woah, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh
I can't pretend
Woah, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh
It's not the end
Woah, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh
Please don't pretend
Woah, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh
It's not the end!
I won't take this!
You lost my sympathy
I, I've had enough of this!
Stand by your fall from grace

Let it sink, don't swim
I was in too deep
But I can't let you take another piece of me
You can break me down little bit by bit
But I won't let you keep another piece of me

(Let it sink, don't swim)
(I was in too deep)
You can break me down little bit by bit
