I can't cope, now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
Yeah!

Under this pressure
I want to disappear
Turn on the lights as I need some clarity
So overwhelming
It's bearing down on me
And when it ends all this weight is crushing me

And nothing's easing, waiting
Patience is wearing
Nothing's helping, wasting
Mentally vacant

I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
You might also like
It's never ending
I see no end in sight
So pull the plug let broken tongues sing through the night
It's almost over
And I can see the light
I still can't focus, need a spark and I'll ignite

And nothing's easing, waiting
Patience is wearing
Nothing's helping, wasting
Mentally vacant

I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling

And through it all
It seems so right
But through it all
I sacrifice
When it's holding you down (holding you down!)
When there's no strength to fight (no strength to fight!)
When it's dragging you out (dragging you out!)
Find the will to survive
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling

I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees
I'm crawling, crawling
I meltdown as everything around keeps falling, falling
Yeah!

(I can't cope now I'm down on my knees)
