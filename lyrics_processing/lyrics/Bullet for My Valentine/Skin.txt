Another wasted breath trying to prove my innocence
I know I've seal my fate, another lie that brings disgrace
I know you want to see, see me hurt, make me suffer
But all that's left are all the
Broken shattered pieces of our lives

I wish that I could tell you so you know
There's things I'm hiding deep beneath my skin
Beneath my skin
I want to tell you so you know
There's things I'm hiding deep beneath my skin
Beneath my skin

So come and take my life, let me feel your wickedness
I know I've made mistakes so come and watch me fall from grace
I know you want to see, see me hurt, make me suffer
I've nothing left so I just sacrifice myself to make it right
(To make it right!)

I wish that I could tell you so you know
There's things I'm hiding deep beneath my skin
Beneath my skin
I want to tell you so you know
There's things I'm hiding deep beneath my skin
Beneath my skin

I want to tell you so you know
I want to tell you
I guess I've fucked things up!
I know it's all my fault!
I'm pretty sure that this will be the death of me
I guess I've fucked things up!
I know it's all my fault
I'm pretty sure that this will be the death of me!

 
I wish that I could tell you so you know

There's things I'm hiding deep beneath my skin
Beneath my skin!
I wish that I could tell you so you know (beneath my skin!)
There's things I'm hiding deep beneath my skin
Beneath my skin (beneath my skin!)
