What's happening to me?
I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts too much to feel
Pressure adds to pain
Deliver us from evil
Straying out of sanity

Why can't you let me be?
Is nothing else important?
Does my mind mean more to you!?
Because if I carry on
Deliver us from evil
Screaming for your vanity

Will darkness turn to light?
(Will darkness turn to light?!)
Can someone wake me from this nightmare?
Here, we, go!
Here, we, go!

The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry
You might also like
So now I hope you see
I'm nothing more than human
Making plans for enemies
But here we go again
Deliver us from evil
Crawling back to insanity

Will darkness turn to light?
(Will darkness turn to light?!)
Can someone wake me from this nightmare?
Here, we, go!
Here, we, go!

The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry

The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering...
What's happening to me?
I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts to much to feel
Pressure adds to pain
Deliver us from evil
(Through evil)
Pressure adds to pain
You're evil, we're evil, I'm evil!


Will darkness turn to light?
(Will darkness turn to light?!)
Can someone wake me from this nightmare?
Here, we, go!
Here, we, go!

The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering (I'm suffering!)
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering (I'm suffering!)
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning (I'm turning!)
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering (I'm suffering!) (I'm turning!)
I'm suffering
I'm turning
