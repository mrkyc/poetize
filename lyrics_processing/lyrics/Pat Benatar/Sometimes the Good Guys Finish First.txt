That's the way we spell success
Will we get it, the answers yes
S-U-C-C-E-S-S
Small town boy, so clean he squeaks
Dressed and polished for the big time dreams
Got a letter from his ma, and a boyish grin
Close his eyes one minute, and it'll lead him to the win, yeah
As you stopped to say hello
You know there's nothin' like heaven that won't get you back
To you get your ass in gear, and your mind on track
When wheels start turnin', things start to fall into place
You'll be suprised what you can do and some talents all it takes
Yeah
Crying over you
Chorus:
When you said so long
Sometimes the good guys finish first
Sometimes your best is all it takes
You know that, sometimes the good guys finish first
Sometimes the good guys, finish first
Crying
Back on logic, turn your head around
Use the front door and avoid the crowds
They'll be tryin' to tell you that it can't be done
Cause the big boys on their own gave us half the fun, hey hey
Don't it make you ask yourself why

But it's true, oh so true
The good guys, the good guys, the good guys, finish first
Than I did before

Sometimes the good guys finish first
Sometimes your best is all it takes
You know that, sometimes the good guys finish first

Cause you don't love me
Sometimes the good guys finish first
Walkin' a straight line in reverse
You know that, sometimes the good guys finish first
Sometimes the good guys, finish first
And don't it make you wonder
When you said so long
Sometimes the good guys finish first
Sometimes your best is all it takes
You know that, sometimes the good guys finish first
