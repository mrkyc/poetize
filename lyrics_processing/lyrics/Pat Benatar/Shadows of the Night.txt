We're running with the shadows of the night
So baby, take my hand, it'll be all right
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
They'll come true in the end

You said, "Oh, girl, it's a cold world
When you keep it all to yourself"
I said, "You can't hide on the inside
All the pain you've ever felt"
Ransom my heart, but baby, don't look back
'Cause we got nobody else"

We're running with the shadows of the night
So baby, take my hand, it'll be all right
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
They'll come true in the end

You know that sometimes, it feels like
It's all moving way too fast
Use every alibi and words you deny
That love ain't meant to last
You can cry tough baby, it's all right
You can let me down easy, but not tonight
