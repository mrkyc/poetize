Goin' day to day
I never knew the difference
I never cared either way
Lookin' for a reason
Searchin' for a sign
Reachin' out with both hands
I gotta feel the kick inside
All fired up (now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up (when everything just falls in line)
All fired up (we live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up
Hey!
Ain't nobody livin'
In a perfect world
Everybody's out there
Cryin' to be heard
Now I got a new fire
Burnin' in my eyes
Lightin' up the darkness
Movin' like a meteorite
All fired up (now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up (when everything just falls in line)
All fired up (we live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up (the deepest cuts are healed by faith)
