And I drive to all points outta New York City to LA
Well, that little woman smiles when I believe her
I'll soon be back; I got the fever
She's a believer
I got the freight liner fever
Now, there's a railroad a-runnin' by a highway out in Santa Fe
And I passed an old freight train makin' his run the other day
Merle Haggard said to his fireman, so pale
We're gonna blow the freight train off of the rails
He got the fever
He got the freight liner fever
Well, pierce that box; what you carryin' in that cigarette pack?
I said, "I got my second driver, and he's gonna drive her all the way back."
It's a big black pill, so round and round
The driver's call it west coast turnaround
It's for the fever
The ol' freight liner fever
Well, I passed Red Sovine in the Wiggling, West Virginia
And I passed Del Reeves in Shreveport, Louisiana
Dick Curtis got hung up on a hill in Maine
I pulled him over with my forty-foot chain
He got the fever
He got the freight liner fever
You might also likeI mean, I passed everything from a Jimmy to a Greyhound bus
I'm gonna spend a few days on the coast at the end of my run
Old giddy-up go and a little bit of luck
Gonna pass Red Simpson and his runaway truck
He got the fever
He got the freight liner fever
Well, pierce that box; what you carryin' in that cigarette pack?
I said, "I got my second driver, and he's gonna drive her all the way back."
It's a big black pill, so long and so round
To a driver it's a west coast turnaround
It's for the fever
That ol' freight liner fever
Yeah, I pass 'em all out here on these old roads
All them ol' country boys
There's Kenny Rogers and Charley Pride
Mel Tillis, Moe Bandy
Mickey Gilly, Boxcar Willie
Porter Wagoner, Johnny Russell
Eatin' up the freeway
Bill Anderson
Wow, there goes Dolly
Got two buses
