I know there's beauty in your face
What is this creature that I've made
That's so afraid of love
What must I say how can I prove
Convince this world, especially you
Just how happy you would be
If I were with you and you with Me
You are beautiful to Me
Beyond the brilliant galaxy
The angels gaze down
On the children of My love, yeah
You are precious in My sight
I want to give you a better life
What will it take for you to believe
That you are beautiful to Me
Before time I knew your name
Before the heavens were in place
I could look upon your face
And see Myself in you
But this world with blinded eyes
Blurs your beauty with their lies
All that's pure and good and right
They don't want you to see
There's no one like...

Does not envy boast with pride
It will never say goodbye
And leave you lonely

My love delights itself in you
Only My truth will prevail
