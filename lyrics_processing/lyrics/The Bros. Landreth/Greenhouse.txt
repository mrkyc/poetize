You're a stream too shallow
You're a heart shaped box with no letter inside
You're a seed unplanted
You're a field run fallow
Your heart's used up
You're feeling cast aside
I'm sorry that I left so soon
I left you standing at the gallows
You were all strung out
The hangman waiting for the sign
Come see me at the greenhouse
In the back yard
Come see me at the oak tree
With our names carved in the bark
Come see me at the train tracks
Bring some pennies for old time's sake
Even though I'm gone
There's some memories that you need to take with you
Now you're working up the courage
Just to walk yourself through that doorway
A big world outside
You're afraid of what you'll find
Now you're leaning on friends
Finding comfort and laughter
You're patching up your heart
You're finding some peace of mind
You might also likeI'm sorry that I left so soon
You're stepping down from the gallows
You were all strung up
The hangman waiting for a sign
Come see me at the greenhouse
In the back yard
Come see me at the oak tree
With our names carved in the bark
Come see me at the train tracks
Bring some pennies for old time's sake
Even though I'm gone
There's some memories that you need to take with you
You found a new lover
You went and got yourself married
You're doing all the things that we never got to do
You had yourself a baby, she's beautiful and happy
Oh lord how I wish I could have given that to you
But I left too soon
I was standing at the gallows
I was all strung up
I gave the hangman the sign
You don't need me at the greenhouse
In the backyard
Down at the oak tree
With our names carved in the bark
Don't make it to the train tracks
Bringing pennies for old times sake
New memories that you need to make
It's time for me to fade away
