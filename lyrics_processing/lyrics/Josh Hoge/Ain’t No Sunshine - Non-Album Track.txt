That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day
You get it
And it's so good to you
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good
So good
But right now I just feel cold
So cold
Right down to my bones 'cause
Hee
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she always gone to long anytime she goes away, hay
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away (anytime she goes away)
