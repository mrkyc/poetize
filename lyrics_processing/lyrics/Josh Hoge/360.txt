So that's the way it is
You can just go find someone else and let me go
Like you don't know owe me a thing
But I can handle this, I've been through it all before
And you get yours and im gonna bounce back again
You can tell someone, that you'll be there
And then walk away, like you don't care
I'm not saying this cause im mad
I just want you to understand
One day, its gonna catch up with you
What goes around comes around
Baby I thought you knew
Do somebody wrong for too long
Its gonna get done to you
And you did me bad and got away
Play me like a fool
Thought you knew, 360 is coming right back to you
You must be sitting on top of the world
Feeling like you're finally free and you will see that it won't be too long
Taking what you deserve, then you're the one that somebody leaves
Then you'll think of me and wish you never did me wrong baby
You might also likeYou can tell someone, that you'll be there
And then walk away, like you don't care
You might decide you want me back but it'll be too late for that
That's all I have to say
What goes around comes around
Baby I thought you knew
Do somebody wrong for too long
Its gonna get done to you
And you did me bad and got away
Play me like a fool
Thought you knew, 360 is coming right back to you
Thought you knew, 360 is coming right back to you
Just like the way that this world turns
Play the game that way and you'll get burned
Thought you know, ohhh
What goes around comes around
Baby I thought you knew
Do somebody wrong for too long
Its gonna get done to you
And you did me bad and got away
Play me like a fool
Thought you knew, 360
What goes around, comes around ohhh (360)
What goes around comes around 360 (360)
What goes around, comes around 360 ohh (360)
What goes around, comes around 360 (360) is coming around
