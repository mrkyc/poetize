Oh, Oh, Oh
Lately I can think straight
All i do is concentrate
How you move your hips
And the way i flip on how your lips taste
Lately can't get nothing done
Cause I can't kiss you more than once
Love or lust, don't know?
One things for sure, i need another one
Oh baby I just can't believe
Even in my dreams
I close my eyes, no where to hide
Cause you is all I see
And I, think about the things i wanna do
To you,I can't get you off my mind, baby and I
And I, am caught up in this physical attraction
Shes my satisfaction
Shes a beautiful distraction
Shes a beautiful distraction, oh no
I try to give you up
But I'm obsessed on every touch
Chills all over me, I can barely breathe
Girl too much ain't enough

Even in my dreams
I close my eyes, no where to hide
Cause you is all I see
And I, think about the things i wanna do
To you,I can't get you off my mind, baby and I
And I, am caught up in this physical attraction
Shes my satisfaction
Shes a beautiful distraction
Shes a beautiful distraction, oh no
There's something else
That I can't control myself in you
You got me feinin'
Can't leave you alone
Whoa, Oh No No No
I think about the things i wanna do
To you, I can't get you off my mind baby
And I, am caught up in this physical attraction
Shes my satisfaction
Shes so beautiful
And I, think about the things i wanna do
To you,I can't get you off my mind, baby and I
And I, am caught up in this physical attraction
Shes my satisfaction
Shes a beautiful distraction
Shes a beautiful distraction, oh no
Shes a beautiful distraction
