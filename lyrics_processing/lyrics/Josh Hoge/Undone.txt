What we have, I'm breaking down
No reason, No warning
No love loss, You might as well
Take our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more
I don't wanna feel you no more
Take out memories, fade out all the sound
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know
I didn't wanna live without ya
I didn't wanna love without ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
And we can be undone
I can't feel without ya
You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
And we can be undone
This constant echoing
In my head, And I'm spinning round
You seem so unaffected
While I go on in this hell
You might also likeTake our pictures off the walls tonight
I don't wanna see you no more

Take our memories, fade out all the sound
I hope you finally get what you want
Now you know

I didn't wanna love with ya
I used to think I'd die without ya
Now it's killing me
And we can be undone

You know I can't deal without ya
And now I got a life without ya
Now it's killing me
And we can be undone
You're talking now
I don't hear it
Everything that you say
I don't hear it
Gone is the new phrase
And it's dragging me along to my grave
