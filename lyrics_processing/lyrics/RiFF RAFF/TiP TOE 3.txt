T-T-T-Tip
Draggin-Draggin' to the floor

Tip-toeing through the jewelry store
Christian Dior mink draggin' to the floor
I don't really care 'bout money anymore
Pay me in jewels while I'm pouring up a four

I-I-I been blessed today
No girlfriend, no stress today
Never was a child, so I never got to play
You know crime pays, no minimum wage
It's closing time
Fishscale falls on my charm, moonshine
Midnight falls in the cold moonlight
Crimes get organized
Diamonds drippin' out the gym
While I'm watching my huskies swim
Can't imagine life any other way
Dale Dan Tony on a razorblade

I think that ho mad we ain't fuckin' anymore
Tip-toeing to the Gucci store
Pussy, why you lookin' at my jewelry for?
That's that shit that I might get a jury for
You tuckin' your shit, why you buy that jewelry for?
Tip-tip-toeing on the marble floors
Thug life, feelin' like 2Pac Shakur
We was tip-toeing on your block, lil' boy
No James Harden, on my wrist a block, lil' boy
