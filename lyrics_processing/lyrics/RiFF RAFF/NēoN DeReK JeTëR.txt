Bitch I'm the youngest nigga flexin'
Always bring them checks in
40 diamonds on my necklace
Look like Prom when the light hit
Bitch I've never been a bitch
I dougie when I dance
Cause my wrist a money fan
And I ball just like Bledsoe
I like fuckin' bitches who like bitches who like money
South 6 Jumanji
Yellow diamonds like a bumblebee
RiFF RAFF my nigga, got a crib out in seven seas
Lifestyle my rollo, take a photo, it'll last longer
She gon' fuck on Boat cause my dick, it just look longer
Rap game Mufasa
Bitch come at me proper
My lil' bitch a Betty Crocker
Whippin' up them pies
Keep my chickens by the fryer
If you get caught, I ain't gettin' fried

It's the tan Deion Sanders
Make it peach panther
Slide through Alabama
In my 'Sace silk pajamas
Ridin' with no ceilin'
Frostbit wrist, yeah I'm ridin' with no feelings
Then I double stuff the blunt
Kiwi kush cream fillin'
Swing the big body
Emerald green Ferarri
Might be Maserati
Now I'm in Abu Dhabi choppin' blocks with Lil Yachty
Lil, Lil Yachty
RiFF!
