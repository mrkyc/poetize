I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine

They call me Jonny Quest and it's a nice night
The eyes bright and they brighter than a lightning strike
The lightning coast, glide a coast, the Pacific coast
I run the keys to Jamaica, Usain Bolt
I'm Michael Bolton boasting bragging in the Aston Martin
A lot of shit up on my chest, Dolly Parton
The iPhone got Carson Daley on the karaoke
My skin tone same colour as the french toast

I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine

Dang, the bellhop, breaking in the bird flock
Aw shit, look who it is the white Chris Rock
I then done spent a grand on a ham steak
I should charge you ten grand for a handshake
Maybe twenty K on a show and tell
Now its 3AM, Taco Bell
I'm stacking up my cheese like a taco shell
I'm sliding through your city on a turtle shell

I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine

I need it, I want it
I would do anything for it
It brings my life enjoyment
Up all night to the early morning
I need it, I want it
I would do anything for it
It brings my life enjoyment
Up all night to the early morning
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
I brought out the rice
She was down to play
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine
We were up all night on cocaine

Up all night to the early morning
Up all night to the early morning
Up all night to the early morning
Up all night to the early morning

I need it, I want it
I would do anything for it
It brings my life enjoyment
Up all night to the early morning
I need it, I want it
I would do anything for it
It brings my life enjoyment
