My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come to funk around
'Tll I get your daughter, I won't leave this town
In the beginning, God made the sea
But on the seventh day, He made me
He was tryin' to rest y'all when He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar cold gettin' down
I tried to bust a high note, but I bust a string
My God was worried 'til He heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only - hurt me
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Hurt me (Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk, I am a junky
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got two sides and they both friends
Don't try to clock 'em, they're much too fast
If you try to stop 'em, they kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When you hear my music, you'll be havin' fun
That's when I gotcha, that's when you mine!
To tell the truth, tell me, what's my line?

Funky fresh for the 90's (Do that, do that, somebody) (Prince)

My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
'Cause I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul
I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came today?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than you
But if you want to play with me, you better learn the rules

The funkier I be
The funkier I get, oh, shit
Lickety split on the lyric
A new jack in the pulpit
Watch it,  deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this you're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak
When you jumped on my D.I.C.K
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was to big for you anyway
You're just a simpleton
I'll bust you like a pimple, son
My star is too bright
Boy, I'll sink you like the ship Poseidon Adventure
You're bumpin' dentures to be cocksure
There must be more coming from
Your mouth than manure
So with a flow and a spray, I say hey
You must become a prince before you're king anyway
(Do that, do that, somebody)
(Do that, do that, somebody)
It's time I get ig-nig-nig-nig-nig-nig-n-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo, so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on
You've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin'
In my cauldron. That means my nugget
Sometimes, I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin'
The other brothers buggin' and this is for those who oppose
And propose to overexpose disclose
Pose a threat to my brother
Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let you play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do you expect you win when you're used to playing craps?
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Hell yeah, let's get this under the hmm
(Do that, do that, somebody)
Damn, It's gettin' tricky
I mean it's a sticky situation
To resurrect a groove with feeling
And give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows
What lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow
12 inches of non-stop soul
I'm on a roll with P, and it's time for the show
So do that, do that, somebody
Wave your hands in the air
This is a motherfucking party
While you're laying back, I'm on the attack, paddywhack
Give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
To layin' some chrome upside some motherfucker's dome
And I'm out

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only

My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
My name is Prince
Yo, man!
What?
She came!
Where?
