(Mike WiLL Made-It)
Right about now, yeah (Ear Drummers)

You put in overtime, overnight
Doing everything I like
Go so right, yeah
You hold me close, squeeze me tight
Look me deep inside my eyes
Baby, you know I love it
But nothing can compare ('Pare)
To when you kiss me there
And I can't lie, when I lie in your arms
Baby, I feel so sexy

So, boy, just take your time (Yi)
Send chills down my spine (Woah)
You're one of a kind (Yi)
That's why I gotta make you mine (Woah)
Boy, you turn me on (Yi)
Got me feeling hot (Woah)
Now I'm really gone (Yi)

I like, I like, I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby, just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby, just like that
I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow

Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow

Yeah
Baby, get a little rough, that's okay
Baby, go ahead, do your thing
Ride on the wave
And I love it when we misbehave
Me and you together, babe
We can do everything
Boy, if somebody could see
The way you kiss on me
Oh, they won't believe it
'Cause even I don't believe it
But I love the way I'm feeling

So, boy, just take your time (Yi)
Send chills down my spine (Woah)
You're one of a kind (Yi)

Speed it up, heat it up
Let it go, let it go, let it go
'Til I get, get enough
You never know, never know, never know
I like that there
Yeah, that there
A little more to the left
Yeah, right there
