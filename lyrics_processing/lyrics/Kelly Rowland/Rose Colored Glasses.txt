Everybody's sayin' that we should get back together
And everybody's sayin' that we're meant to be together
Everybody's sayin' how the love was so damn perfect
And I ain't never seen a bit of it, don't think it's worth it, 'cause

They ain't been through the things that you put me through
And they ain't seen all the things that I've seen in you
And they ain't never cried the tears you made me cry, so
They can't be the judge, 'cause

They don't know what I know
They never seen that part of you
They know the lies, I know the truth
They say stay, I say go
They never seen our scars before
They think our love is beautiful
'Cause everything is beautiful when you're looking through
Rose colored glasses
Everything seems amazing when you see the view
In rose colored glasses
Take 'em off

Everybody's thinkin' I was just too scared to love you
You got 'em all believing that I folded under pressure
It's crazy how I gave my best, I tried so hard to love you
I can't believe that all this time, my pain just brought you pleasure
You might also like
But they ain't been through the things that you put me through
And they ain't seen all the things that I seen in you
And they ain't never cried the tears you made me cry, so
They can't be the judge, 'cause...

They don't know what I know
They never seen that part of you
They know the lies, I know the truth
They say stay (They say stay)
I say go (I say go)
They never seen our scars before
They think our love is beautiful
'Cause everything is beautiful when you're looking through
Rose colored glasses (Oh, oh)
Everything seems amazing when you see the view
In rose colored glasses
Take 'em off

(Hey)
Take 'em off (No, oh)
Take 'em off (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take 'em off (Take 'em off)
Take 'em off (Oh, oh)
Take 'em off (Off, off)
'Cause
They don't know what I know (What I know)
They never seen that part of you
They know the lies, I know the truth (I know the truth)
They say stay (They say stay)
I say go (And I say go)
They never seen our scars before
They think our love is beautiful (So beautiful)
'Cause everything is beautiful when you're looking through
(Beautiful when you're looking through)
Rose colored glasses (Oh)
Everything seems amazing when you see the view
In rose colored glasses
