This ain't gon' be easy
Uh
You got it? You got it?
Put it in

Tables turnin' to a situation
Now you standin' in my face and you been patiently waitin'
Fumblin' over words, forget the conversation
Thinkin' maybe we can make a combination
Wanna see me lose my breath and wanna hear me moan?
Better be ready, well and able when we get along
You was talkin' confident upon the telephone
So you gotta put it in when we get it on

No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (Hey!)
Ain't no coming down from this high
My love don't go nowhere 'less I say
Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be your last opportunity to move me
You might also like
(Put it in!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it
(Put it in!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it
(Go hard!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it
Don't come around if you gon' let me down
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work

Now you lookin' like you lookin' for an explanation
Use the curves in my body for your motivation
Skip the petty games, no need for complications
Use both hands to make sure I reach my destination
You better leave a good impression 'fore you hit the dough
'Cause you don't want me talkin' 'bout your business on the low
If you show it off, I had to fit you in my schedule
So you better put it on me when it's time to go!
No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (Hey!)
And ain't no coming down from this high
My love don't go nowhere 'less I say
Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be your last opportunity to move me

(Put it in!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it (Get it)
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it (Do it, d-do it, baby do it)
(Put it in!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it (Uh yeah)
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it
(Go hard!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it
Don't come around if you gon' let me down
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work
I ain't acceptin' no excuses, baby (N-n-no)
To brag about it, it'd be useless, baby (N-n-no)
You better blow me away, make a girl want to stay
At your spot for another round
It's your chance to prove, don't forget your moves
There's nothing to lose, but me!

Put it in!
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it (Put it in, put it in, put it in)

Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it (Check it, check it baby, get it babe)
(Go hard!)
Check it, baby, get it, baby, check it, baby, get it (Uh huh)
(Work!)
Do it, baby, do it, do it, baby, get it (Uh huh, yeah)
Don't come around if you gon' let me down (Don't you come around)
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work
