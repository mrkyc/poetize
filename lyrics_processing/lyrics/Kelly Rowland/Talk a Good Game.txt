You talk a good game
I really wanna believe you
But I got questions in my head like
Is it true
What to do
I don't wanna see myself
(Play the fool, baby, ooh)
Uh uh, no way
I prefer you keep it real with me
Cause I-I

Don't think I can take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way when you can just be honest?
I'mma do what I'm supposed to do
If you tell me you got us
Why do things the hard way?
'Cause if you give me your love and I give you mine's back
If you get to acting up, I cut you off like that
I don't think I can take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way?

If love is free and talk is cheap
(Don't make me pay for all your mistakes ,boy)
Finally go just be free
Thought you'd get to know me
(Don't tell the same stories)

Promises and promises
You say they all counterfeit
If we start off telling lies
This love will never amount to shit
You really think me, I'm the one?
Or you just like the sound of it?
If the motive's all wrong, heartaches what you 'bound to get
Give me one shot, better pour it quick
I'mma kill it girl, full clip
You wearing all white, I'm in all black
We standing by the pulpit
You say I do, I say I do
I'm tired of all the bullshit
I don't think I can take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way when you can just be honest?
I'mma do what I'm supposed to do
If you tell me you got us
Why do things the hard way?
'Cause if you give me your love and I give you mine's back
