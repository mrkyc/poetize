Yeah
Feel real good

Mirrors on the ceilin'
Cameras on the corners of my bed (Yeah)
I barely know you, but I'm feelin'
Like you really did somethin' to my head (Yeah)
It's close to midnight
And I just wanna be up in your hair (Yeah, right on)
And I'll be alright
As long as I feel your body right there
It seems so crystal clear, I know that

Everybody's
Somebody's
Freak
Say it again, say it again (Right on)
Everybody's
Somebody's (Yeah)
Freak
The question is whose are you?

(Right on)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak?

Don't need no television
I'll just watch your body goin' down (Yeah)
I'll touch you with precision
Go crazy when you make those sounds
Feels like the best dream
But this time, baby, you can be the star
A freaky sex dream
Read your lines, make sure you play your parts
And when you get next to me, turn the lights out

Everybody's
Somebody's
Freak
Say it again, say it again (Right on)
Everybody's
Somebody's (Yeah)
Freak (Freak, freak)
The question is whose are you?

(Right on)
Can I be your, your, your, your freak (Right on)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak
(Right on)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak (Right on)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak
Vases, chandeliers
Glass of wine, can of beer
Alcohol can't interfere
Here's the wheel, can you steer?
Don't need to get senalier
You perform, I will cheer
You could scream, no one hears
Feed your face, no one cares
The floor appears to be yours
Go ahead, pop the champagne
It's like we on a world tour
The sex'll be your campaign 'cause

Everybody's (Yeah)
Somebody's (What?)
Freak (Right on)
Say it again, say it again (Turn the lights on)
Everybody's (Yeah)
Somebody's (Yeah)
Freak (Freak, freak; right on)
The question is whose are you?

(Hands in the air now)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak? (Right on; hands in the air now)
(Hands in the air now)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak? (Yeah)
(How we do it right here; right on)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak? (Right on)
(I know how to get a party started, baby)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your freak? (Super freak)
I think that's enough (Yeah)
