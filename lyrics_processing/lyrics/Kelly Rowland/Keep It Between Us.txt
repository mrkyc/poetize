They say true love is enough
Forever, forever
Then I'll stay here in your arms
Forever, forever

Not a thing in this world I won't give up
Can't live in this world if I'm not next to you, to you, to you
Just a plain old girl, I don't need nothing
They say I got it all, but they don't know that all is you, is you
So don't give your love away, away, away, away
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And I won't give my love away, away, away, away
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Let's just keep it between us
Let's just keep it between us
Let's just keep it between us
Let's just keep it between us

Can't see myself with no one else
No never, no never
I can make it through the worst with you
So whatever, so whatever
You might also like
Not a thing in this world I won't give up
Can't live in this world if I'm not next to you, to you
So don't give your love away, away, away, away
Oh oh, oh oh
And I won't give my love away, away, away, away
Oh oh, oh oh
Let's just keep it between us
Let's just keep it between us
Let's just keep it between us
Let's just keep it between us
Just keep it between us

Know that I don't ever wanna wanna hurt ya
And I don't think nobody else deserves ya
And I don't think I can see nobody else here with me
Promise to love you and to cherish and to nurture
And when the time is right, we can take it further
Long as I know that you're here to stay
And never give your love away

Away, away, away, away, oh oh, oh oh
And I won't give my love away, away, away, away, oh oh
