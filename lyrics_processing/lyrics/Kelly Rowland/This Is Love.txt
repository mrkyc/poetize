Can you describe the moment
When two people fall in love?
Some say the clouds will spin in circles
And the rain will turn to dust
The poor will start to laugh
Even the rich will start to cry
It can sneak up like a soldier
It can wake you up at night
That is what I feel when I'm standing here with you
It's what my heart has sworn to be true

This is love
It's written on my face
It's the way I lean my body towards you
Even when I'm a hundred miles away
This is love
Like a diamond in the sand
It took so long to find you
I cannot wait another day to say
This is love
This is love

You take my imperfections
And turn them into art
If I can change one thing about you
There would be no place to start
You are safety without numbers
You are dangerously wild
But you are sweeter than rock candy
And you ease my inner child
It's what I feel when I am standing here with you
It's what my heart has sworn to be true
You might also like
This is love
It's written on my face
It's the way I lean my body towards you
Even when I'm a hundred miles away
This is love
Like a diamond in the sand
It took so long to find you
I cannot wait another day to say
This is love
This is love

No, I'm no easy angel
I'm moody like the wind
I'm impatient, complicated
I'm fragile, deep within'
But you're no fool
And I'm no little girl
Have we not found
There's love in the world

This is love
It's written on my face
It's the way I lean my body towards you
Even when I'm a hundred miles away
This is love
Like a diamond in the sand
It took so long to find you
I cannot wait another day to say
This is love
