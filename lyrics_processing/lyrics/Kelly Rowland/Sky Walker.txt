Dream (What's up)
Kelly

Boy, you got a bitch zonin' (Let's go)
It's damn near five in the mornin' (Let's go)
Kinda wish that I could clone it
For the times when you're not around, yeah
Boy, I'll never leave you lonely (Yeah)
Be your one and only
You need a main girl that fucks you like a side chick (Yeah)
Let go and stop fuckin' around

You need that sexy girl, that independent
That ridin' around this bitch and gettin' it
That no bloggin', that hustle hard
At home, on the job
Put it on you like, "Ooh, Lord"
Real shit, no fraud
Hit the mall, then buy you somethin'
I ain't frontin'

(Ayy, ayy, oh, yeah)
Don't nobody do me like you do
I'm so ATL
And I'm so Houston
Baby, can't you tell
That I know what I'm doin'?
Baby, can't you tell
That I know what I'm doin'?
You might also like
Think you know you got me crazy (Let's go)
Shit, callin' you "baby" (Let's go)
Questions I used to say no to, now it's maybe
Picture you turnin' me out
All good, all hood
I can make sure your love is never misunderstood
I'll have you like she never had you (Yeah)
Stop fuckin' around

You need that sexy girl, that independent
That ridin' around this bitch and gettin' it
That no bloggin', that hustle hard
At home, on the job
Put it on you like, "Ooh, Lord"
Real shit, no fraud
Hit the mall, then buy you somethin'
I ain't frontin'

(Ayy, ayy, oh, yeah)
Don't nobody do it like you do
I'm so ATL
I'm so Houston
Baby, can't you tell?
Don't care where you been
Who you been with, how it ended
Just love me
I don't care how recent
Sure, you got your reasons
Boy, pick up your future and leave the past
I'll take your good and your bad

First off, fuck Wendy Williams, fuck TMZ
Fuck these fake niggas, these niggas ain't half of me (Yeah)
You know the clique, you see the chain
Jordan's on, Oozie earrings (Yeah)
And I'm here with you, they can't hold me down
(They can't hold me down)
Black and ugly as ever (Shit), however
They know they still rockin' with the best ever

Ayy, oh (Oh, yeah)
Don't nobody do me like you do
I'm so ATL
Boy, I'm so Houston
Baby, can't you tell?
Tell, tell
