We want two different things at two different times
You know how the story goes; easy come, easy go
If I could change everything overnight, I just might try
But then again

You know how it goes
Make up just to break up
Fighting in the evening
Regret it when we wake up
True colors get shown
Feelings change like the seasons
I had to leave you alone
You gave me too many reasons

Tried your love at five in the mornin'
I never thought that you would hurt me
Yeah, baby, you sure did, I put up with your shit, call and I ignore it
Why you actin' like it ain't five in the mornin'?
When you know you ain't worthy
See, I just need someone to come and pick me up

'Cause I've been down on love
Lately
Lately, I've been down on love
I've been down on love (Love)
Lately
Lately, I've been down on love
You might also like
You know what they say
Win some, you lose some
Forgot about that old love
Looking for a new one
But you know what they say
No, don't be lookin' for love, lookin' for love
'Cause when I needed you around, you just let me down

Tried your love at five in the mornin'
I never thought that you would hurt me
Yeah, baby, you sure did, I put up with your shit, call and I ignore it
Why you actin' like it ain't five in the mornin'?
When you know you ain't worthy
See, I just need someone to come and pick me up

'Cause I've been down on love
Lately (Oh, lately)
Lately, I've been down on love
I've been down on love
Lately
Lately, I've been down on love (Down on love, love, love)

We want two different things at two different times
You know how the story goes; easy come, easy go
If I could change everything overnight, I just might try
But then again
Would you do the same? Would you give it all up?
Would I be the only one calling out your name?
Would you return the favor, would you do the same?
Would I be the only one calling out your name?
'Cause I've been down on love (Love)
Lately (Lately)
Lately, I've been down on love (Love)
I've been down on love (Love)
Lately (Lately)
Lately, I've been down on love
'Cause I've been down on love (I've been down, down on love)
Lately (I've been down, down on love)
Lately, I've been down on love (I've been down, down on love)
(I've been, no, no, I've been down on love)
I've been down on love (Love)
Lately (Lately)
