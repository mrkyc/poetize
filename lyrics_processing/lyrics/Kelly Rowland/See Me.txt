So I waited up for you, just to come home to me
Got some things that I got to show
Know use speaking
Let your body talk to me
If you give me all control

Than I might turn the lights off
Or if you like we just might keep the lights on
I want you to see me
You decide boy
If you like for the night keep the lights on
I want you to lay down, stay down
Ain't got time to play now
Grab me by my waist now
Wanna say your name loud
And turn the lights off
Or if you like we just might keep the lights on

I want you to see me
(I-I-I want you to see me)
I want you to see me
(I-I-I want you to see me)
You might also like
No more talkin'
Make your way up to my bedroom
Show you what you can not live without
Anything goes only you allowed
Take my time with my eyes
I am undressing you
What we doing is overdo
Runnin' back like we gone for two

Feels so good when you leave it all over me
Love it all over me
You know how to come for me
Baby, don't fail me now
Keep the same energy
I know you gon' like it when you see me with the lights on

Waited up for you, just to come home to me
Got some things that I got to show
Know use speaking
Let your body talk to me
If you give me all control

Than I might turn the lights off
Or if you like we just might keep the lights on
I want you to see me
You decide boy
If you like for the night keep the lights on
I want you to lay down, stay down
Ain't got time to play now
Grab me by my waist now
Wanna say your name loud
And turn the lights off
Or if you like we just might keep the lights on
I want you to see me
(I-I-I want you to see me)
I want you to see me
