I can remember when
People called me crazy
When I confide in you
They say I'm, I'm laid back and lazy

Batshit crazy
Knew that you were trouble and nobody could save me
No matter what you do, you'll always be my baby
Even if you hurt me and you make go ape shit
Ape shit, ape shit, still my favorite
I'm a big girl, baby, I can take it
Wanna make it up? You know we both better naked
Wanna have your baby, come, come

'Cause your love's addictin', more than a drug
When you're gone, it's like taking air from my lungs
I need you so much, it scares me
Hooked on you, clearly
No matter what I do, boy, I'm fucked

But if I'm gon' be crazy
Crazy for anything
I'll be crazy for you
If I'm gon' be crazy
Crazy for anything
I'll be crazy for you
If I'm gon' be crazy
Crazy for anything
I'll be crazy for you
If I'm gon' be crazy
Crazy for anything
I'll be crazy, I'll be crazy for you

Batshit crazy
I ain't really been getting like any sleep lately
Break up, make up, relationship shaky
Hate you, love you, fuck you, pay me
All day, all night, baby
Will we be together? Well, I say maybe
Some days, we're cool, some days, just shady
But I can't fake it, fake it, fake it

'Cause your love's addictive, more than a drug
When you're gone, it's like takin' air from my lungs
I need you so much, it scares me
Hooked on you, clearly
No matter what I do, boy, I'm fucked

But if I'm gon' be crazy
Crazy for anything
I'll be crazy for you
If I'm gon' be crazy
Crazy for anything
I'll be crazy for you
If I'm gon' be crazy
Crazy for anything
I'll be crazy for you
If I'm gon' be crazy
Crazy for anything
I'll be crazy, I'll be crazy for you
Love me, touch me, baby
Hug me, fuck me crazy
Make me crazy for you
Love me, touch me, baby
Hug me, fuck me crazy
