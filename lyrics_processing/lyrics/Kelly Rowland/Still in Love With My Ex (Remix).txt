Ex (Yeah)
Ex (Kelly and Yung Texxus)
Ex (Yeah)
 
I never thought that we would break up for the better
Should have never made the promises to each other
So many things I should have said that you did not know
Coming in from a past with a heavy load
But I knew that you were a good man
Give me love, you were faithful - It showed on my hand
I know there are questions in your mind you do not understand
Through the words of this song, I want to answer them
Honesty (Check)
Conversation (Check)
A shoulder I can lean on anytime I am feeling stressed (Check)
Good loving (Yes)
The perfect soldier (Yes)
Was about to say "I do," when I know it was not meant
So I

Search in my mind, trying to figure it out
And thought I was happy but I am having some doubts
Think I found the answer and I know I must confess
I am still in love with my ex
And I was not ready when I said that I loved you
And in my heart, I know that I got to tell you
I should not have gone from a situation to the next
I am still in love with my ex
You might also like 
Every moment that I stayed, I dug a deeper hole
I was with you but my heart would not let him go
All my family told me, "Kelly he is the one for you"
I know your family love me and I love them too
(I am so sorry) I am so sorry for the pain I put you through
But you should not have to suffer because I am confused
So much for looking forward to future plans
Lost the love of my life and I lost a friend
Good to me (Yes)
Security (Yes)
You were all the things I wanted
Checking everything (Check, check)
You were comforting (Yes)
Romantic man (Yes)
How could I have said "I do," when I knew it was not meant
So I

 
Silence
(I do not know why you are telling me all this now)
I have got to own this
I have got to own this game
(Yeah, I am not the one you chose)
I cannot believe I am saying this
Saying sorry is the hardest part
(Yeah aye, it is Yung Texxus)
From make-up's to break-up's
His and her Jacob's
My armor got issues galore, sure
We was all good-good, and it was all good-good
Now I am reading old love letters (Damn)
My homies looking at me like, "You know better"
But I am reminiscing so I had to consider
Did she go hard for me? (Yes)
Take a charge for me? (Yes)
Turn her head when the other hoes were calling me? (Yes)
I cannot lie, when she left she took a part of me
Part of me want her back but part of me cannot pardon she (Nope)
Calls it foolish pride but shit, who am I?
I made my mistakes, tossed my dirt to the side
Every time we meet I see the hurt in her eyes
Because I am an ex-friend, ex-homey, ex-lover
So stop the phone calls, voicemails, etc
Shawty keep the ring, forget the day I ever met you
