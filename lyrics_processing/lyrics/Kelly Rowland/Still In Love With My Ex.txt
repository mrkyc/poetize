Ex
Ex
Ex

I never thought that we would break up for the better
Should've never made the promises to each other
So many things I should've said that you didn't know
Coming in from a past with a heavy load
But I knew that you were a good man
Gave me love, you were faithful, it showed on my hand
I know there are questions in your mind you don't understand
Through the words of this song, I wanna answer them

Honesty (check)
Conversation (check)
A shoulder I can lean on anytime I'm feeling stressed (check)
Good loving (yes)
The perfect soldier (yes)
Was about to say "I do," when I knew it wasn't meant
So I...

Searching my mind, trying to figure it out
And, thought I was happy, but I'm having some doubts
Think I found the answer and I know I must confess
I'm still in love with my ex
And I, wasn't ready when I said that I loved you
And in my heart, I know that I gotta tell you
I shouldn't have gone from one situation to the next
I'm still in love with my ex
You might also like
Every moment that I stayed, I dug a deeper hole
I was with you, but my heart wouldn't let him go
All my family told me, "Kelly, he's the one for you"
I know your family loves me, and I love them too
I'm so sorry for the pain that I put you through
But you shouldn't have to suffer 'cause I'm confused
So much for looking forward to future plans
Lost the love of my life, and I lost a friend

Good to me (yes)
Security (yes)
You were all the things I wanted
Checking everything (check, check)
You were comforting (yes)
Romantic man (yes)
How could I have said "I do," when I knew it wasn't meant
So I...

Searching my mind, trying to figure it out
And, thought I was happy, but I'm having some doubts
Think I found the answer and I know I must confess
I'm still in love with my ex
And I, wasn't ready when I said that I loved you
And in my heart, I know that I gotta tell you
I shouldn't have gone from one situation to the next
I'm still in love with my ex
Silence, I've gotta own this
I can't believe I'm sayin' this
Saying sorry's the hardest part

Searching my mind, trying to figure it out
And, thought I was happy, but I'm having some doubts
Think I found the answer and I know I must confess
I'm still in love with my ex
And I, wasn't ready when I said that I loved you
And in my heart, I know that I gotta tell you
I shouldn't have gone from one situation to the next
