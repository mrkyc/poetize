Let's get lost in this space
Oh love
Where they can't find us for days
Oh wahh
You got a sweet sense of mmm
Sure 'nuff
It's so good
You gotta tell me shut up
I'm no good when it comes to your touch

And I can't even help you, babe
And I don't want you to ever stop
Stop the way that your loving me
Baby, you've got my heart
With everything that's inside of me
Give you more than just part of me
You know that you got my heart

Only for you
Baby, it's all yours
You can put your name on it
Only for you
What you waiting for?
You can put your name on it
Only for you
Baby, it's all yours
You can put your name on it
Only for you
Baby, you got my heart
You might also like
Let's get carried away
No rush
Just when you think it's the end
It ain't over
Just wanna stay in your arms
Helpless
It's so good
Gotta tell me shut up
I'm no good when it comes to your touch

Only for you
Baby, it's all yours
You can put your name on it
Only for you
What you waiting for?
You can put your name on it
Only for you
Baby, it's all yours
You can put your name on it
Only for you
