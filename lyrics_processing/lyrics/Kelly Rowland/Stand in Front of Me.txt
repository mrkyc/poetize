He said

He said, "Stand in front of me
Let me palm that ass
Show 'em you're my girl
In MAC lipstick
I'll be the king (The king)
As long as you stand in front of me (In front of me)
In front of me (In front of me)
Stand in front of me (In front of me)
In front of me (In front of me)"

My life's become a fantasy
I wake up, you're my (Man)
Give me the world like, "Here you go"
Just by grabbin' my hand (Hand)
What you are, it puzzles me
And I love when you say "Stand in front of me (Front of me)
In front of me (Front of me)
Stand in front of me"

I was asked something long ago
I couldn't answer and it bothered me a little
"How do you keep your man?"
And I found the best answer is simple
You just do it, do it, mean it, prove it
That's how you keep your man, how you keep your man
How you keep your man, how you keep your man
Ladies, do it, do it, mean it, prove it
Oh, you gotta have a plan, gotta take a chance
That'll keep your man, that'll keep him sayin'

So I get down on bended knee
And grab you by your hand
You're like, "Oh no, babe, you can't do that"
I'm like, "Oh, yes I can"
Or we can just go back to cuddling
Or you could just say "Stand in front of me (Stand in front of me)
Stand in front of me (Stand in front of me)
Front of me (Stand in front of me)"
