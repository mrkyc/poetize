Thought you knew
That I got you for all time

Baby, just breathe
I know it gets hard for you to see that
We gon' make it out alright
Just look at me
I promise I won't leave you tonight
Imma make it last for life

They can't break us down if they try
They don't know the tears that we cried
It's never going to change
I know we can make it through anything

So don't you worry
Don't you know I got you, baby
Thought you knew I'm right, right here by your side
Ain't no worries
Don't you know I got you baby
Thought you knew that I got you for all time

You're the sweetest eye, just like paradise
Wanna love you over and over

They don't know the tears that we cried
It's never going to change
I know we can make it through anything

So don't you worry
