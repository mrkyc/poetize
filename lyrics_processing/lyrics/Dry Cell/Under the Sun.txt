We measure our lives in years, but they don't mean much
Always fading away the things we can't touch
I didn't want you to go, I didn't want you to stay
I didn't want you to know what was inside of me
We measure our lives in years, but they don't mean much
Always fading away the things we can't touch
I never told you a lie, I never meant to deceive
I never gave you the time, or led you to believe
Let it go, let it go
I'm all alone, so far away, under the sun
(Sometimes you stay, sometimes you run)
Don't want to be the only one underneath the sun
We measure our lives in years, but they don't mean much
Always fading away the things we can't touch
I'm never seeing it through, I'm always walking away
Maybe I don't believe that it's inside of me
We measure our lives in years, but they don't mean much
Always fading away the things we can't touch
I can't believe that I'm lost, I don't know how to survive
I can't believe that I'm here and that I'm still alive

I'm all alone, so far away, under the sun
(Sometimes you stay, sometimes you run)
Don't want to be the only one underneath the sun
Sometimes I feel I'm on my way, sometimes I feel I'm on my own
It's harder and harder every day, nobody wants to be alone
I'm all alone, under the sun
(Sometimes I feel I'm on my way, sometimes I feel I'm on my own )
Don't want to be the only one
(It's harder and harder every day, nobody wants to be alone)
I'm all alone, so far away, under the sun
(Sometimes you stay, sometimes you run)
Don't want to be the only one underneath the sun
I was looking for myself, got lost along the way
