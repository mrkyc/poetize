You can never guide, I dunno how to hide
I confide, something's wrong
What is it you see when you look at me?
Am I all you hoped I'd be?
Or have I become the ungrateful son?
You know, the one you speak of
I remember back to when I was young, there was so much going on
We were very tight, now we always fight
I confide, something's wrong
Nothing's ever good, nothing's ever pure as you slam another door
Who am I to be, what will I become?
I'm not a child anymore
Follow me out, into the world
Wish there was someway for me to be heard
More that we shout, further I am
We do this over and over again
To tell the truth, I've been getting through, everytime I pass through you
I've been moving on, finally belong
I confide, something's wrong
Maybe we can mend in a couple years after all the air has cleared
But I think for now i'll be moving on, I gotta learn to be strong

Wish there was someway for me to be heard
More that we shout, further I am
We do this over and over again
Why, why did you?
Why, why did you?
Why, why did you turn away?
Why, why did you?

Tell me what you see when you look at me?
Am I all you hoped I'd be?
You don't have the right, everything is fine, because I can confide
Follow me out, into the world
Wish there was someway for me to be heard
More that we shout, further I am
We do this over and over again
Why, why did you?
Why, why did you?

We do this over and over again
