(Day)
Day of reflection
(After day)
Life of rejection
(Slip away)
Sometimes I need to
(Slip away)
Want you
(Say)
Say that you'll help me
(Say)
Please, don't you let me
(Slip away)
Sometimes I need to
(Slip away)
Are you so far gone?
(Every time it starts, I try to slip away)
So far gone
(Every time it starts)
Finally when I'm at my end
(Something inside is gonna break you, stand up)
Nothing's like it was before
I so wish I could just pretend
(Something inside is gonna break you, stand up)
But there's nothing left to adore
You might also like(Time)
To be remembered
(After time)
Something I'll never
(I find)
Whatever I do
(Defy)
Do you
(Take)
World that I live in
(And take)
I'll never give in
(Slip away)
Whatever I do
(Slip away)
Love you
So far gone
(Every time it starts, I try to slip away)
So far gone
(Every time it starts)
Finally when I'm at my end
(Something inside is gonna break you, stand up)
Nothing's like it was before
I so wish I could just pretend
(Something inside is gonna break you, stand up)
But there's nothing left to adore
Something inside is gonna break you, stand up
(Something inside is gonna make me stand up)
Something inside is gonna break you, stand up
(Something inside is gonna make me stand up)
Something inside is gonna break you, stand up
(Something inside is gonna make me stand up)
I don't understand this world that we are living in
People give you things so they can take them back again
I don't want to be part of history, I just want my life to be the way that it should be
Every now and then I find a way to slip away
Every now and then there's only so much I can take
If I find a way, I would leave today
(Way)
Day of reflection
(Home)
Life of rejection
I don't know if I can find my
(Way)
Say that you'll help me
(Home)
Please don't you let me
Though it's hard, sometimes I still try
(Way)
Day of reflection
(Home)
Life of rejection
I don't know if I can find my way
