I gotta find my way back
Back to summer paradise
Sean Paul, Simple Plan

My heart is sinking as I'm lifting
Up above the clouds away from you
And I can't believe I'm leaving
Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do
But someday
I will find my way back to where
Your name is written in the sand (Stay in my brain)

'Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
And we were never gonna say goodbye (Yeah)
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Quick time, quick time girl) Oh-oh
Tell 'em

We're playing in the sand (Me and you girl)
Holding your hand (Make some noise)

I remember every word you said
And we were never gonna say goodbye (Yeah)

To where your name
