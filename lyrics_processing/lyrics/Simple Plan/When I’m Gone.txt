We're doing it

I look around me
But all I seem to see
Is people going nowhere
Expecting sympathy
It's like we're going through the motions
Of a scripted destiny
Tell me where's our inspiration
If life won't wait
I guess it's up to me

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh

Procrastination, running circles in my head
While you sit there contemplating
You wound up left for dead (Left for dead)
Life is what happens while you're busy making your excuses
Another day, another casualty
And that won't happen to me

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
Let's go!
Won't look back
When I say goodbye
I'm gonna leave this hole behind me
Gonna take what's mine tonight
'Cause every wasted day becomes a wasted chance
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry
'Cause life won't wait
I guess it's up to you

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
