I don't wanna make this
Harder than I have to
This is how it has to be
There's so many things I want to say
But you just don't listen to me

I don't wanna hurt you
You don't wanna hurt me
I can't stand you
And you can't stand me
We can't rearrange
You could never change me
Say goodbye
Nothing I say could change your mind because...

I can't stay
Tomorrow I'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there
I won't be there

Everything I say
You find a way to make it
Sound like I was born just yesterday
And everything you taught me
Doesn't mean a thing
So I'm going my way

Tomorrow I'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there

This is the last night
That I spend at home
And it won't take too long
For you to notice
Won't take long for you to find out
That I'm gone

I can't stay
Tomorrow I'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there
I can't stay
Tomorrow I'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there, yeah
I won't be there
I won't be there
