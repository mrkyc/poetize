This is who I am and this is what I like
GC, Sum and Blink and Mxpx rocking my room
If you're looking for me, I'll be at the show
I could never find a better place to go

Until the day I die, I promise I won't change
So you better give up

I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change
I just wanna have fun
I don't wanna be told to grow up
And I don't wanna change
So you better give up
'Cause I'm not gonna change
I don't wanna grow up

I like to stay up late, spend hours on the phone
Hanging out with all my friends and never being at home
I'm impolite and I make fun of everyone
I'm immature, but I will stay this way forever
