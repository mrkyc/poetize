Hey hey
Hey hey

Sometimes I feel like everybody's got a problem
Sometimes I feel like nobody wants to solve them
I know that people say we're never gonna make it
But I know we're gonna get through this
(Close your eyes and please don't let me go)
Don't, don't, don't, don't let me go now
(Close your eyes don't let me let you go)
Don't, don't, don't

Take my hand tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow
Take my hand tonight
We could find some place to go
'Cause our hearts are locked forever
And our love will never die
Take my hand tonight
One last time

The city sleeps and we're lost in the moment
Another kiss says we're lying on the pavement
If they could see us they would tell us that we're crazy
But I know they just don't understand
(Close your eyes and please don't let me go)
Don't, don't, don't, don't let me go now
(Close your eyes don't let me let you go)
Don't, don't, don't

Take my hand tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow
Take my hand tonight
We could find some place to go
'Cause our hearts are locked forever
And our love will never die
Take my hand tonight
One last time

Hey hey
Hey hey

The raindrops
The tears keep falling
I see your face and it keeps me going
If I get lost your light's gonna guide me
And I know that you can take me home
You can take me home
Take my hand tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow
Take my hand tonight
We could find some place to go
'Cause our hearts are locked forever
And our love will never die
Take my hand tonight
One last time
Take my hand tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow
Take my hand tonight
We could find some place to go (Find some place to go)
'Cause our hearts are locked forever
And our love will never die
Take my hand tonight
