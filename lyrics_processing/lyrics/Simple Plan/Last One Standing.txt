How many times are you gonna try to shut me out?
I told you once, told you twice, I ain't turning back around
You can say whatever, try to mess with me
I don't care, I'm not scared
You don't have to say you're sorry, save your sympathy
With a friend like you, I don't need an enemy
I would give you time if you were worth it
But guess what, you're not worth it

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, I'm always gonna be the last one standing
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, 'cause I'm never gonna give up trying
And now I'm ready to go, I'm here, I'm waiting for you
And I'm gonna be the last one standing
The last one standing

Did you think that I would surrender easily?
That just like that, you were getting rid of me
Is that the way you saw it all go down?
I don't think, I don't think so
There's not a word you can say I haven't heard before
So give it up, give it up unless you want a little more
You think you're pretty tough, so let's throw down
It's alright, I'm alright

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, 'cause I'm never gonna give up trying

I won't give up, I keep trying
(I'm always gonna be the last one standing)
It's not over, I keep fighting
(I'm always gonna be the last one standing)
I won't give up, I keep trying

It's not over, I keep fighting
I keep fighting!
