We started off incredible
Connection undeniable
I swear I thought you were the one forever
But your love was like a loaded gun
You shot me down like everyone
'Cause everyone's replaceable
When you're just so incapable
Of getting past skin deep

Guess what, another game over
I got burned, but you're the real loser
I don't know why I've wasted my time with you, whoa
You're bad news, a history repeater
You can't trust a serial cheater
You're good at hooking up, but you suck at love
You suck at love

You played me like an amateur
Then stabbed me like a murderer
I'm left for dead, another one of your victims
It's not like you're unpredictable
But your act is so believable
I know it's nothing personal, it's just business as usual
You're good at what you do

I got burned, but you're the real loser
I don't know why I've wasted my time with you, whoa
You're bad news, a history repeater
You can't trust a serial cheater
You're good at hooking up, but you suck at love
You suck at love

Now I kinda feel bad for you
You're never gonna know what it's like to have someone to turn to
Another day, another bed, it's just a game inside your head

Guess what, another game over
I got burned, but you're the real loser
I don't know why I've wasted my time with you, whoa
You're bad news, a history repeater
You can't trust a serial cheater
You're good at hooking up, but you suck at love
Guess what, another game over
I got burned, but you're the real loser
I don't know why I've wasted my time with you, whoa
You're bad news, a history repeater
You can't trust a serial cheater
You've messed this whole thing up
Well you were such an awesome fuck
