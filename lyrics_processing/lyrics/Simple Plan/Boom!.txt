In a world full of heartache
Seems like everyone's burning out
You and me we did it our way
And this love ain't running out
We got that fire, that glow
And I just need you to know

You're my favorite song, my sing-along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity, the best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom!

Don't worry about tomorrow
Cause these walls will never fall
I just wanna let the world know
What we got's unbreakable
We got it under control
We're good, we're solid, we're gold
