That's it
That's it

I fall asleep by the telephone (Telephone)
It's two o'clock and I'm waiting up alone
Tell me, where have you been? (Where have you been?)
I found a note with another name (Another name)
You blow a kiss, but it just don't feel the same
'Cause I can feel that you're gone (Feel that you're gone)

I can't bite my tongue forever
While you try to play it cool
You can hide behind your stories
But don't take me for a fool

You can tell me that there's nobody else (But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself (But I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But I know, I know
Your love is just a lie (Lie, lie)
It's nothing but a lie (Lie, lie)
See Simple Plan LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
You look so innocent (So innocent)
But the guilt in your voice gives you away
Yeah, you know what I mean (Know what I mean)
How does it feel when you kiss when you know that I trust you
And do you think about me when he fucks you?
Could you be more obscene? (Be more obscene)

So don't try to say you're sorry
Or try to make it right
Don't waste your breath because it's too late, it's too late

You can tell me that there's nobody else (But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself (But I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But I know, I know
Your love is just a lie (Lie)
It's nothing but a lie (Lie)
You're nothing but a lie

You can tell me that there's nobody else (But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself (But I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But I know, I know
Your love is just a lie
I know you're nothing but a lie (Lie)
You're nothing but a lie (Lie)
