My heart is sinking
As I'm lifting up
Up above the clouds away from you
And I can't believe I'm leaving
Oh, I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do
But someday
I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand

'Cause I remember every sunset
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye
Singing la-da-da-da-da
Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you
And I'll be there in a heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Oh-oh
I'll be there in a heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Oh-oh

My soul is broken
Streets are frozen
I can't stop these feelings melting through
And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
Just to have another one with you
Well, real life can wait
We're crashing like waves
We're playing in the sand
Holding your hand, yeah yeah
