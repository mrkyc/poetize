I'd be a "For Sale" sign on the side of the road
I'd be a broke-down heart with a secondhand soul
Be a King James dust-covered on a Sunday
I'd be a tumbleweed at the will of the wind
Goin' halfway to hell and back again
I'd be way off, no doubt I'd be a lost cause

If it wasn't for a prayin' woman
If it wasn't for an angel who believed
If it wasn't for the folded-hand "amens"
To the Man upstairs talkin' 'bout me
Yeah, I'm boots and jeans in a back pew church
She's a halo here on Earth
Lookin' out for me
Lord knows where I'd be
If it wasn't for a prayin' woman

Every time I last-second saw the light
Yeah, every wrong turn that ended up right
Things like that don't just happen
I don't wanna imagine

If it wasn't for a prayin' woman
If it wasn't for an angel who believed
If it wasn't for the folded-hand "amens"
To the Man upstairs talkin' 'bout me
Yeah, I'm boots and jeans in a back pew church
She's a halo here on Earth
Lookin' out for me
Lord knows where I'd be
If it wasn't for a prayin' woman

Amen, oh, can I get an "amen"?

'Cause if it wasn't for a prayin' woman
If it wasn't for an angel who believed
If it wasn't for the folded-hand "amens"
To the Man upstairs talkin' 'bout men (Talkin' 'bout me)
Yeah, I'm boots and jeans in a back pew church (Back pew church)
She's a halo here on Earth (Here on Earth)
Lookin' out for me
Lord knows where I'd be
If it wasn't for a prayin' woman

Lord knows where I'd be
If it wasn't for a prayin' woman
Lord knows where I'd be
