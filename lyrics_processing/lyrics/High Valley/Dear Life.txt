Dear life, I hope you know
I've loved you every mile down this road
Had my share of hits and misses trying keep between the ditches
Dear life, I hope you know

Dear life, what's your plan
Is where I'm suppose to be, right where I am?
If it is then I ain't leaving, if it ain't I'll keep on dreaming
Dear life, what's your plan

Now you're flying by too fast
I'ma fight to make you last
I'm beggin' won't you please, just slow down
You're scaring me to death
I'm tryin' to catch my breath
Don't wanna let you go
I'm hangin' on for dear life
Oh oh dear life
Hangin' on for dear life
Oh oh dear life

Dear life, how's it look
When you read the next few pages of my book
Am I with the ones I love, down here or up above
Dear life, how's it look
You might also like
Now you're flying by too fast
I'ma fight to make you last
I'm beggin' won't you please, just slow down
You're scaring me to death
I'm tryin' to catch my breath
Don't wanna let you go
I'm hangin' on for dear life
Oh oh dear life
Hangin' on for dear life
Oh oh dear life

I wanna leave my mark
Love 'til it breaks my heart
Live so loud that my forever echos in the dark
I wanna leave my mark
Love 'til it breaks my heart
Live so loud that my forever echoes in the dark

You're flying by too fast
I'ma fight to make you last
I'm beggin' won't you please, just slow down
You're scaring me to death
I'm tryin' to catch my breath
Don't wanna let you go
I'm hangin' on for dear life
Oh oh dear life
Hangin' on for dear life
