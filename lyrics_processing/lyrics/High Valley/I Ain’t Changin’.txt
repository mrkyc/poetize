I grew up on the seat of a John Deere tractor bailing hay
Now I'm standing in the middle of a high rise city on a subway train
I'm sure jaws are dropping, small town talking
Let 'em talk away, I don't care, I don't care

I'm still gonna be the reckless wheel that kicks up all that gravel
I can feel the roots underneath these boots when I walk the road less traveled
I'm still the son of the  back in them good old days
Yeah, what you see is what you get, no matter what they say
I ain't changing a letter of my last name
The way I talk or the way I pray
Carve the stone like a tattoo that ain't fading
I ain't changing, I ain't changing

I'm still make some racket, leather jacket, hometown proud
I'm still say the blessing, learn your lesson, watch your mouth
I packed all that up in the bed of my truck when I hit the road
No matter where I go, no matter where I go

I'm still gonna be the reckless wheel that kicks up all that gravel
I can feel the roots underneath these boots when I walk the road less traveled
I'm still the son of the  back in them good old days
Yeah, what you see is what you get, no matter what they say
I ain't changing a letter of my last name
The way I talk or the way I pray
Carve the stone like a tattoo that ain't fading
I ain't changing

I like my tough love, red blood rebel heart that beats
Like the words in those old hymns that we used to sing
I ain't changing

I'm still gonna be the reckless wheel that kicks up all that gravel
I can feel the roots underneath these boots when I walk the road less traveled
I'm still the son of the  back in them good old days
Yeah, what you see is what you get, no matter what they say
I ain't changing a letter of my last name
The way I talk or the way I pray
Carve the stone like a tattoo that ain't fading
