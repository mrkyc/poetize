Hard to read, hard to please, yeah that was my old man
On the day I left I for college it was nothing new
We never had that heart to heart, he had too much to do
He checked the air in my tires, the belts and all the sparkplug wires
Said when was the last time you had this oil changed
And as I pulled out the drive he said, "be sure and call your mom sometime"
I didn't hear it then but I hear it now
He was saying "I love you," the only way he knew how
A hundred twenty thousand miles and 6 years down the road
Brand new life brand new wife we just bought our first home
When he finally came to visit I thought he'd be so proud
He never said he liked the place he just got his tool belt out
And put new locks on the doors, went back and forth to the hardware store
Said come and hold this flashlight as he crawled beneath the sink
These old wires aren't up to code and that circuit box is gonna overload
And I didn't hear it then but I hear it now
He was saying I love you the only way he knew how
Last Sunday we all gathered for his 65th birthday
And I knew he'd stiffen up but I hugged him anyway
When was finally time to say goodbye I knew what was next
Just like he always did right before he left
He checked the air in my tires, the belts and all the sparkplug wires
Said when was the last time you had this oil changed
And as I pulled out the drive he said, "be sure to call your mom sometime"
And I wish I knew back then what I know now
