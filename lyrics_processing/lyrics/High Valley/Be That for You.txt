Just startin' out, no way of knowin'
Are we a river? Are we an ocean?
Just a flash in a pan or a Hollywood kinda romance
Girl, you're the brush, I'm a blank page
Do what you want 'til I'm tailor-made
What's your picture-perfect look like?
I wanna get right

If you want a Friday downtown howlin' out at the moon
If you want a Sunday slow drive outta church afternoon
If you want an alibi, a shoulder to cry, someone to love you for the rest of your live
I could be that, I could be that, I could be that for you
Be that for you

The hand in your hand, the voice on the phone
Your getaway car, your place to call home
The wind-down when you had a day, your umbrella in the pouring rain

If you want a Friday downtown howlin' out at the moon
If you want a Sunday slow drive outta church afternoon
If you want an alibi, a shoulder to cry, someone to love you for the rest of your live
I could be that, I could be that, I could be that for you
Be that for you
Oh, I could be that for you

Mmm, baby, if you want me to
