Well a single man
Goes wild and crazy on a Tuesday night
Stays out 'til 2am and don't think twice
Burns through money and his pickup lines

And a single man
Is always down to grab a 2-for-1
Makes a plan, ain't gotta ask no one
He can wake up anywhere he wants

But I don't know a single man
Who'd pick the kick of whiskey over your kiss
Take any old night over a night like this
Stay young forever over growing old with you
I don't know a single man
That ain't out looking for what I got
That wouldn't die to be where I am
No I don't know, no I don't know a single man

Yeah a single man
Don't get to wake up looking at your smile
Ain't late to work from kissing you goodbye
Don't get to hold you tight every single night

Girl I don't know a single man
Who'd pick the kick of whiskey over your kiss
Take any old night over a night like this
Stay young forever over growing old with you
I don't know a single man
That ain't out looking for what I got
That wouldn't die to be where I am
No I don't know, no I don't know a single man

Every single time you walk in a room
Every single guy's got their eyes on you

Girl I don't know a single man
Who'd pick the kick of whiskey over your kiss
Take any old night over a night like this
Stay young forever over growing old with you
I don't know a single man
That ain't out looking for what I got
That wouldn't die to be where I am
No I don't know, no I don't know a single man
That ain't out looking for what I got
That wouldn't die to be where I am
No I don't know, no I don't know a single man
No I don't know a single man
