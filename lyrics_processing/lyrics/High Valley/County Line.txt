Where the money runs out, that's where we begin
Right smack dab where the blacktop ends
And the fields got hay, hay's got barns
Barns got a loft for watching them stars
Falling right out of the clear blue collar sky
Yeah just lovin' this life

On the dirt road side of the county line
Ain't rich but we're doin' alright
Got my honey on my arm, Jesus in my heart
Living like a lyric out of Fishin' in the Dark
Yeah we work hard, live right
Tear it up on a Saturday night
On the dirt road side of the county line
Dirt road side of the county line

We like to keep a little mud on the tires, country on the dial
Let the night roll on for a country mile
Round and round this town we go
Never growin' up, man it never gets old

On the dirt road side of the county line
Ain't rich but we're doin' alright
Got my honey on my arm, Jesus in my heart
Living like a lyric out of Fishin' in the Dark
Yeah we work hard, live right
Tear it up on a Saturday night
On the dirt road side of the county line
Dirt road side of the county line

Red light, revvin' up, pocketful of paychecks
Spend it on your honey cause she's money in a sundress
Laid-back steering wheel, hold on, keep it real
Never gonna leave it cause I love the way it feels
On the dirt

On the dirt road side of the county line
We ain't rich but we're doin' alright
Got my honey on my arm, Jesus in my heart
Living like a lyric out of Fishin' in the Dark
Yeah we work hard, live right
Tear it up on a Saturday night
On the dirt road side of the county line
