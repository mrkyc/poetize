Yeah, it's been a while since you've been around
Won't you come on down, just come on down

You don't need no invitation
Day or night we're right here waiting
Just drive out until the pavement ends
Sign says population: 2817
One stop light and a Dairy Queen
Saw mills, farms, refineries
Yeah, that looks like home to me
If you still believe in faith and family
You'll find them in this little town

Come on down
Come on, come on down
Out here in the country
We'll leave the light on for you
And we never lock the door
Just come on down
Come on, come on down
To the land of milk and honey
Our arms are always open
You can make yourself at home
Just come on down
You might also like
If something happens to your neighbour
Or, the church has a fundraiser
It's the front page of the paper
It's just a seven-pager
Every house has a good book and
Kitchens all smell like home cooking
If a tractor's what you're looking for
You'll find one here for sure
Everyone's a fan of, yes sir, thank you ma'am
Way out here in this little town

Come on down
Come on, come on down
Out here in the country
We'll leave the light on for you
And we never lock the door
Just come on down
Come on, come on down
To the land of milk and honey
Our arms are always open
You can make yourself at home
Just come on down

Tell me when you're gonna visit
Come on, you know you miss it
Come on down
Come on, come on down
Out here in the country
We leave the light on for you
And we never lock the door
Just come on down
Come on, come on down
To the land of milk and honey
Our arms are always open
You can make yourself at home
Just come on down

Come on, come on down
Out here in the country
We leave the light on for you
And we never lock the door
Just come on down
Come on, come on down
To the land of milk and honey
Our arms are always open
You can make yourself at home
Just come on down

It's been a while since you've been around
Won't you come on down, just come on down
It's been a while since you've been around
Won't you come on down, just come on down
