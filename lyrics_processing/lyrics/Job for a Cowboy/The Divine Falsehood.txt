Upon his horns rested ten crowns
As the discord of trumpets grew unnerving
Its perception giving an overruling mentality of authority and supremacy
All dwellers of earth shall pray and worship this form of a single demon
Whose names are not written in ink or blood in the Book of the Life of the Lamb
Shall be slained from the foundation of this declining and now decaying world
I stood in the sand from the mouth of the sea And I watched a serpent rise from its depths
Upon his horns rested ten crowns
As the discord of trumpets grew unnerving
Its perception giving an overruling mentality of authority and supremacy
All dwellers of earth shall pray and worship this form of a single demon
Whose names are not written in ink or blood in the Book of the Life of the Lamb
