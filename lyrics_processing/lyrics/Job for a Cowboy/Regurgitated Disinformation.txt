Day-to-day instrumental broadcast
That flows through the net of mass media
The lungs swell as the puppets speak
To the public as their words grow
Limbs to crawl and to give birth to ignorance
Reports endlessly drift and cloak reality
Leaving mass audiences
To believe into layers of fiction
The hellish elite
Pull the vulnerable strings
Of journalism with the mastery of everyday
Blood money and ultimatums
The boundless flavour
Of dominance on the starved tongue
Gives these kings a mental state
Of ambitious arousal
For corruption steadily trickles
From their fingertips
And showers into the pool
Of forged mental assurance at their feet
The sleeping masses live on
In their so called tranquil lifestyle
Lifestyle!

Above law and above government
Disinformation will constantly
Leave a nation
A nation!
As a forever Sleeping giant
Due to the ongoing voice of propaganda
