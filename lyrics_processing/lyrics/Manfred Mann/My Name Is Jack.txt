My name is Jack and I live in the back
Of the Greta Garbo Home
With friends I will remember
Wherever I may roam

And my name's Jack and I live in the back
Of the Greta Garbo Home for Wayward Boys and Girls
We all love Jack and we live in the back
Of the Greta Garbo Home for Wayward Boys and Girls

There goes Fred with his hands on his head
'Cause he thinks he's heard the bomb
And here comes Superman
Who really puts it on
It's lots of fun and I love to run
Up and down the stairs
I make as much noise as I want
And no one ever cares
(No one ever, ever, ever cares)

And my name's Jack and I live in the back
Of the Greta Garbo Home for Wayward Boys and Girls
We all love Jack and we live in the back
Of the Greta Garbo Home for Wayward Boys and Girls

And he's never sad at all
And when I grow up, I want to run
As fast as my friend Paul
There's the prettiest girl in the whole wide world
And her name is Melody Mend
And here comes Ma with brother Tom
Who's probably my best friend
(Well, Tom is my best friend) My best friend
(Well, Tom is my best friend)

And my name's Jack and I live in the back
