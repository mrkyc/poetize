Question what a pop star sells you (La-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Question mom and question dad (La-da-da)
Question good and question bad (La-da-da-da-da-da-da)

If history could set you free (From who you were supposed to be)
If sex in our society (Didn't tell a girl who she would be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight
What history has given me, me

Sex, sex, sex, sex (Yeah), sex, sex, sex, yeah (La-da-da)
