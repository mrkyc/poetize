I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

Do you expect me to believe that you've changed
When I can tell that you're exactly the same?
You'd rather shut your eyes than feel any pain
Told myself I can't go back ever again (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

You try to tell me that we're so deep in love
Well, if we were, then why did we fuck it up? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Told you before that love isn't enough
Come on, baby, I can call your bluff

I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

How can I trust you after what I've been through?
You only care about me when it suits you
Women love too early and men love too late
And now your promises, they just suffocate (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
You might also like
You try to tell me that we're so deep in love
Well, why, why did you mess it up?
Told you before that love isn't enough
Come on, baby, I can call your bluff

I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

Mm, mm
Don't come back knocking at my door
Mm, mm
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

Are you worth the risk? I just can't make up my mind
I've been choosing your heart, your heart over mine
I don't understand how you missed all the signs
Signs

I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform
Mm, mm
Mm, mm

I love you, but I love me more
Don't come back knocking at my door
You've had your chance and now you want more
You say you'll ch-change, you say you'll transform

Mm, mm
