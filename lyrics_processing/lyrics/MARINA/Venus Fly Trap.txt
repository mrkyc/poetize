Whatever you give life, you will get back
Why be a wallflower when you can be a Venus fly trap?

I never quite fit in to that Hollywood thing (Ah)
I didn't play that game for the money or the fame (Ooh)

I did it my way, baby
Nothing in this world could change me

Don't underestimate me 'cause one day, you're gonna see
You're in a losing battle, babe, you'll never stop me being me
I got the beauty, got the brains
Got the power, hold the reins
I should be motherfucking crazy
Nothing in this world could change me

I sacrificed it all for a life to call mine
All the love and security to be myself, oh, I
I know that money ain't important (Ah)
And it don't mean you're the best (Ooh)
But I earned it all myself
And I'm a millionairess
You might also like
I did it my way, baby
Nothing in this world could change me

Don't underestimate me 'cause one day, you're gonna see
You're in a losing battle, babe, you'll never stop me being me
I got the beauty, got the brains
Got the power, hold the reins
I should be motherfucking crazy
Nothing in this world could change me

They'll shame you, blame you, pretend to even hate you
Take away your rights, pacify you with their lies
Whatever you give life, you are gonna get back
Why be a wallflower when you can be a Venus fly trap?

Don't underestimate me 'cause one day, you're gonna see
You're in a losing battle, babe, you'll never stop me being me
'Cause whatever you give life, you're gonna get back
Why be a wallflower when you can be a Venus fly trap?

Nothing in this world, ooh
Nothing in this world could change me
