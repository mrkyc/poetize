Heartbreaker, real faker
Getting off on bad behaviour
I know you inside and out, out, out
You're losing your temper
Do you think they won't remember?
You're only sorry when you're coming down, down, down

(I know)
Real hearts don't lie
Take it from me (I know)
You'll see in time
Take it from me

It's funny how it all goes down
Don't be sorry when it comes around
I'm like, "Oh my god, I think it's karma"
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ain't it funny how it all adds up
When you're always tryna push your luck?
I'm like, "Oh my god, I think it's karma"
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh my god, I
Oh my god, I think it's karma
You might also like
It starts with one snowball
Then you watch the dominoes fall
You carried on and on
Without a doubt, doubt, doubt (Doubt, doubt, doubt)
So vicious, this cycle
When you live in sweet denial
But you'll be sorry when you're coming down, down, down

(I know)
Real hearts don't lie
Take it from me (I know)
You'll see in time
Take it from me

It's funny how it all goes down
Don't be sorry when it comes around
I'm like, "Oh my god, I think it's karma"
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ain't it funny how it all adds up
When you're always tryna push your luck?
I'm like, "Oh my god, I think it's karma"
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh my god, I think it's karma
Oh my god, I think it's karma

And when your world comes crashing down (It won't save you)
All of the money in this town (It won't save you)
Won't save your reputation now (It won't save you, ooh)

Real hearts don't lie
Take it from me (I know)
You'll see in time
Take it from me

It's funny how it all goes down
Don't be sorry when it comes around
I'm like, "Oh my god, I think it's karma"
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ain't it funny how it all adds up
When you're always tryna push your luck?
I'm like, "Oh my god, I think it's karma"
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh my god, I think it's karma
Oh my god, I think it's karma
