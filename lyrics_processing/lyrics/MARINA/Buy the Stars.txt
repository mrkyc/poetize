You bought a star in the sky tonight
Because your life is dark and it needs some light
You named it after me, but I'm not yours to keep
Because you'll never see that the stars are free

Oh, we don't own our heavens now
We only own our hell
And if you don't know that by now
Then you don't know me that well

All my life I've been so lonely
All in the name of being holy
And still, you'd like to think you know me
You keep buyin' stars
And you could buy up all of the stars
But it wouldn't change who you are
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are
It's just who you are

You bought a star in the sky tonight
And in your man-made dark
The light inside you died
You might also like
Oh, we don't own our heavens now
We only own our hell
And if you don't know that by now
Then you don't know me that well

All my life I've been so lonely
All in the name of being holy
And still, you'd like to think you own me
You keep buyin' stars
And you could buy up all the stars
But it wouldn't change who you are (Who you are)
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are
It's just who you are

Yeah, you know only how to own me
You know only how to own me
You're buying stars to shut out the light
We come alone, and alone we die
And no matter how hard you try
I'll always belong in the sky

(You could buy up all the stars)
(But it wouldn't change who you are)
(You're still living life in the dark)
(It's just who you are)
And you could buy up all of the stars
But it wouldn't change who you are
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are
It's just who you are
It's who you are, it's who you are
It's who you are, it's who you are
It's who you are, it's who you are
