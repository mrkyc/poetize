And your bed was made, must've cut out sometime last night
My heart beat started pounding out rhythm in my brain
A voice from deep inside said you've got to be insane
Everyone knows how this old story goes
So I got in that taxi; drank my conscience away
If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight
Start livin', out with the old, I'm all lit up
Must be the good life
I went to your friends house and begged you to open the door
With your hands on your hips you spoke while I sat down on that floor
Two dishes in the kitchen sink, the way you treat me when you drink
You don't look so superior when you give your opinion
Don't think i don't know how you act on your own
And just who are those names on your cell phone anyway
If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight
Start livin', out with the old, I'm all lit up
Must be the good life
You're a cool breeze on the setting sun
New Year's , The 4th, wrapped into one
You make me want to be someone that you could look up to

If you're gonna stay, stay tonight
Start livin', out with the old, I'm all lit up
Must be the good life
