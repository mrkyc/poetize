We were dead set on makin' it last forever, forever and a day
I recall it was fall last year when, it started to die
You stand still as the temperature kills, the summer strokes that were keeping it alive
The day got colder so I held you closer, in an effort to save us from time
Almost like the wind came and ruined the spark and left us in the dark
But hey- I coulda told you that I loved you and stay
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late
On my return and now you've lost all faith
And I am a liar
I'm no longer what you require
See, I still feel you at night, turning in the sheets when I turn out the light
It's how it goes, the ghost of your first love won't ever leave you til the day that you die
I won't ever live down leaving her behind even if the choice was the right one
It was a good thing staring me right in the face but I turned and ran away
I coulda told you that I loved you and stay
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late
On my return and now you've lost all faith
Cause I am a liar
I'm no longer what you require
Back then the days were so much faster
We were young stubborn and in love with disaster
You know you can't go back even if you try
You better just forget it won't you close the door on me
Cause it will never be the same
It will never be the way it was before
