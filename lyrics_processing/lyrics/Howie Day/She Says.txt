Of her room
Window open by candle light
How would you know
Cold Winter on the shore
Chills a dress she wore
It's on the floor
It feels so warm today
And that's why I'm wondering
Why you had to tell me
What's goin' on in your head
What's wrong
Come around to another time
When you don't have to run
And when she says she wants somebody else
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and makes a sound
You'll never hear her
The way that i do
And when she says she wants someone to love
I hope you know
She doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and lets you down
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean to
Yeah, yeah, I know it

Over hills
Over her hills, it's twilight
Yeah, I guess that's right now
While we're here, tell me why it's so funny
That you're so funny when you're mad
Always mad, so mad
And that's why I'm wondering
Why you had to tell me
What's goin' on in your head
What's wrong
Come around to another time
When you don't have to run
And when she says she wants somebody else
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and makes a sound
You'll never hear her
The way that i do
And when she says she wants someone to love
I hope you know
She doesn't mean you
And when she breaks down and lets you down
I hope you know
That she doesn't mean to
Yeah, yeah, I know it
Yeah, and I don't know where
Come and find me
And I don't know what it means to me
And you don't know what it means to you
