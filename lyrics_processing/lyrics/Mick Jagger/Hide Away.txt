Hide away
Make sure that I never come back
Dissapear and I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Make sure
I'm gonna pick up all my bags
Vanish while I can
Leave this town behind
Pay it all no mind
I'm gonna fly away
And no one's gonna find me
Keep my destination quiet
Take an early morning flight
And never tell a soul
Just light out on my own
I'm gonna fly away
And no one's gonna find me
I'm gonna wear some fake disguise
Change the colour of my eyes
I'm going hide away
Yes, and youre gonna be surprised
I'll be wise before my time
I'm gonna hide away

Make sure that I never come back
Dissapear and I never come back
I'm gonna rent a small hotel
Throw away my cell
Cut of all my hair
Sweep away my cares
I'm gonna fly away
And no one's gonna find me
I'm out of everybodys reach
Out on some twisted beach
I'm gonna hide away
Dissolve right out this scene
Out of everybodys dreams
I'm gonna hide away
Hide away
Make sure that I never come back
Dissapear and I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Dissapear and I never come back
(Hide away) hide away, baby
(Hide away) hide away, baby
(Hide away) oh no, no, no
(Hide away) oh yeah
I'm never gonna come back, baby
I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Dissapear and I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Dissapear and I never come back
Make sure that I never come back
Dissapear and I never come back
Never, never, never come back
