And children reading history books
Their faces light and laugh

How did you survive?
It all seemed so different then
How did you stay alive?

Did you walk cool in the fifties, daddy?
And did you dress like James Dean?
Did you wear dungarees?
Did you dance to the rhumba?
Was it all just crazy fashion?
I said, "Oh, yeah"
Did you live life with a passion?
I said, "Oh, yeah"
Does it all have some strange meaning?
Can it change my life today?
Or is it all so much flotsam and jetsam?
Tell me right away
