We got half a love, we got half a scheme
Always sitting in the darkness, I'll wait for you
Nervous of the neighbors, I'd like a hotel room
'Cause I'm indiscreet, can't keep quiet
Heaven I don't know how
I can't go on seeing you like this
Give that knife just one more little twist
This affair is really going to break my heart
Living half a life is better than nothing, half a dream
You know I can't keep quiet 'cause I'm indiscreet
I guess half a loaf leaves me feeling hungry
Half a glass, half a dream, half a life
Heaven I don't know how
I can't go on seeing you like this
Give that knife just one more little twist
This affair is really going to break my heart
Let's call our friends! Let's go hang out!
Let's go out dancing! Let's jump and shout!
Let's go be seen! Let's dress up chic!
Show we're in love! Right on our street!
You might also likeLet's go out trashy! Let's go act cheap!
What does it matter what other people think?
Step in the bright lights! Let's go act wild!
I want to show that you're mine all mine
Here's to freezing in the doorways
Here's to taking separate taxis
To our stolen conversations
We're never seen together
Half a dream, half a life, heaven I don't know how
But I can't go on seeing you like this
I can't go on seeing you like this
Give that knife just one more little twist
This affair is really going to break my heart
Half a dream, half a life, half
I can't go on seeing you like this
I can't go on seeing you like this
I can't go on seeing you like this
I can't go on seeing you like this
Give that knife just one more little twist
I can't go on seeing you like this
I can't go on seeing you like this
Give that knife just one more little twist
