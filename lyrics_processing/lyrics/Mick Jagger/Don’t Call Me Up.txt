But you won't tell me how
Lately I'm finding it tricky
With your picture plastered all over town
Friends pick you up in conversation
Just to see how I'll react
I get this internal lacerations
That jack me up and lay me out flat
But I can't throw my life away
I can't give the game away
You just wandered off the stage
And left me dealing with the pain
So don't call me up, oh, when you wanna cry
'Cause I might let you down
Don't call me up on some rainy night
'Cause I might let you down, let you down
People ask, Have you seen her?"
I say not for a while
I'm gonna see my girlfriend way down in Argentina
We're gonna have a blast for a while
But I see you in my inner eye
Touch me with a gentle smile
Wonder if you catch my mood
Can you feel all my solitude?
You might also likeDon't call me up, oh when you wanna cry
'Cause I might let you down
Don't call me up when some other guy
Hangs your heartstrings out to dry
As the waves crash around
And the stars hit the ground
I'll be out of my mind once again
As the rain lashes down
And the stars can't be found
I will hold my head high
And just gaze at the sky
I was under your spell
And you took me to hell
Don't call me up if you wanna cry
I might let you down
Don't call me up if you want some lie
I might let you down
Might let you down
Might let you down
Might let you down
I was trying, I was trying to forget you
Yeah, but you won't tell me how
Now you're all over town
You're plastered all over town
