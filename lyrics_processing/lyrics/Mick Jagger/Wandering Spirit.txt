When all the twelve Apostles try to ring me on the phone
Take a message, but I wouldn't return their call
For I have no eyes to see him, and I thought I lost my way
And I know I've lost the keys to your door, well, ah
And I climbed the highest mountain, and I looked down on the sea
And I saw a ship a-sail to the shore
I took a passage to the East, and I journeyed to the West
I made love from Battambang to Baltimore

I said, oh, am I running in a race?
I said, oh, am I getting any place?
I said, oh, can I make it?

I'm a wandering spirit
Yes, I'm a wandering spirit
Oh yes, I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit, yes, I am a restless soul
I'm a wandering spirit, there's no place that I can call my own
Oh, yes

I was a glutton at the banquet, and I spilt the finest wine
Trod the pyramids and ruins of Angkor
And I kissed the Mona Lisa, and I breakfasted with kings
And I touched the nerves of nature in the raw
You might also like
I said, oh, am I running in a race?
I said, oh, take that smile right off your face
I said, oh, I can't make it

I'm a wandering spirit
Oh yes, wandering spirit
Oh yes, wandering spirit, no escape, no parole
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
There's no place that I can call my home


I said, oh, am I running in a race?
I said, oh, take that smile right off your face?
I said, oh, can I make it?

I'm a wandering spirit
Oh yes, a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit, looking for a place to go
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit
I'm a wandering spirit, no escape, no parole
