Lost, lost, lost, lost

I went to see England, but England's lost
I went to see England, but England's lost

And everyone said we were all ripped off
I went to see England, but England lost
Lost, lost, lost
It wasn't much fun standin' in the rain
And we all yelled loud and we all complained
Wasn't much of a game
I got soaked
Didn't look home anyway

I went to see England, but England's lost
I went in the back, but they said, "Piss off"
I went to see England, but England's lost
I went to see England, but England...
I went to see...
I went...
I...

I lost a blunt, think I lost the pint
She can go home and smoke a joint, anyway
Do you wanna go?
I went to find England, it wasn't there
I went to find England, it wasn't there
I think I lost it in the back of my chair
I think I'm losing my imagination
I'm tired of talking about immigration
You can't get in and you can't get out
I guess that's what we're all about

I went to find England, but...
I went to find England, but...
I went to find England, but...
I went to find England, but England's lost

Lost, lost, lost, lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost

Had a girl in Lisbon, a girl in Rome
Now I'll have to stay at home
So lock the shallows, bolt the doors
Nothing's gonna be like Singapore
Don't know what's home
Lost, lost, lost, lost
They didn't turn up, the comments complain
No real person is matching their shame
They're much too young and much too old
Growing much too hot and much too cold
That's what I thought
I went to find England
I went to find England
I went to find England
