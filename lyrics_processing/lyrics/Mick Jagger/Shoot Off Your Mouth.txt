Why do you always do me down, down, down?
I hit rock bottom
You gave me up without sound, sound, sound
But now I'm back in town and feeling mighty fit
I'm sick and tired of eating all your chicken shit
So keep on looking for me
Once I was lost but now I'm found, found, found
I was a rising star
You hitched your wagon next to mine, mine, mine
The sun was shining bright
I guess I never read the sign, sign, sign
Right at the moment that you saw my hand first slip
Just like a dirty rat you jumped the sinking ship
So keep on looking for me
Once I was lost but now I'm found, found, found
Find me at the palace
Find me on the street
Find me back in church
Right in my favourite seat
Now you're a notch on my gun
Now you're a notch on my gun
Who are you to shoot off your mouth?
You might also likeWild-eyed and crazy
I always threw my cash around, 'round, 'round
You put the boot in
Until the bottom fell right out, out, out
I turned around you smell like monday morning's fish
I can't get near enough to take a goodbye kiss
So keep on looking for me
Once I was lost but now I'm found, found, found
Uh huh, oh yeah
Uh huh
Find me in the movies
Right on the tv screen
Keep on searching for me
And you will hear me scream
Now you're a notch on my gun
Now you're a notch on my gun
Who are you to shoot off your mouth?
Shoot off your mouth
But now I'm back in town and feeling mighty fit
I'm sick and tired of eating all your chicken shit
So keep on looking for me
Once I was lost but now I'm found, found, found
Uh huh, oh yeah
Uh huh
Find me at the palace
Find me on the street
Find me back in church
Right in my favourite seat
Who are you to shoot off your mouth?
Shoot off your mouth
Shoot off your mouth
Shoot off your
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot
Don't shoot, don't shoot
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot
Don't shoot, don't shoot
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot
