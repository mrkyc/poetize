Today's the day so make a way out of here
To a higher ground
You got to make a move, it's up to you
No one else is gonna bring you down
No, no
I know that people have let you down
'Cause when you're down, I know
There's only one way to go, so now don't you know

So take a chance, break a chance
How you gonna know if you don't know now?
You gotta find a way, it's okay
No one's gonna stop you from looking ground
You gotta take some time, hear your mind
Everyone's got something that searching for
And maybe you'll find it (And maybe you'll find it)
And maybe you'll find it (Maybe you'll find it)

'Cause I've been there, in dispair
Waiting for my life to turn itself around
Well, it stayed the same, but nothing changed
Too many days in the lost then found
So let me be the one
And I'll help you to see
What you could really be
You might also like
So take a chance, break a chance
How you gonna know if you don't know now?
You gotta find a way, it's okay
No one's gonna stop you from looking ground
You gotta take some time, hear your mind
Everyone's got something that searching for
And maybe you'll find it (And maybe you'll find it)
And maybe you'll find it (Maybe you'll find it)


So let me be the one
To help you to see
What you could really be

So learn to dance, start a romance
Step a little outside the comfort zone
You can play guitar, be a star
Make a yourself song you can call your own

Better take some time, hear your mind
Everyone's got something they're searching for
And maybe you'll find it (Maybe you'll find it)
You could be will find with it (You could be will find with it)
Maybe you'll find it, alright
You could be will find with it
Maybe you'll find it
And then you will know
To make you find it, alright
And then you will know
To make you find it
Find it
Gonna try like we've never known
Maybe you'll find it
