I've got no where to go
There's no one were that know me
No messages on my phone
'Cause I've got my guitar on the back seat
That why I'm slowing down this road
There's nothing more that I need
Why do I feel alone
'Cause I'll be alright all I need is a sign
It's a long road
But I'm hoping things would just get better
Well I need to find
Where everything on the line
I got to make a change
It's now or never
I'm moving at my own phase
No chance of slowing down
To get to where I'm going
There no time to way around
Alright
'Cause I'll be alright all I need is a sign
It's a long road
But I'm hoping things would just get better
Well I need to find
Where everything on the line
I got to make a change
It's now or never
You might also likeI can't look a back
At what could have been
You just got to keep on moving on
You can't think about
What should have been
It doesn't break you
Makes you stronger in the end
I know
Well I know
Yeah...
Well I know
'Cause I'll be alright all I need is a sign
It's a long road
But I'm hoping things would just get better
Well I need to find
Where everything on the line
I got to make a change
It's now or never
'Cause I'll be alright all I need is a sign
It's a long road
But I'm hoping things would just get better
Well I need to find
Where everything on the line
I got to make a change
It's now or never
'Cause I'll be alright all I need is a sign
It's a long road
But I'm hoping things would just get better
Well I need to find
Where everything on the line
I got to make a change
