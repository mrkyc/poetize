You can't escape it or run away from the pain
I've always been a shoulder, there to help you through
Turn the light out, tell me what the hell I'm supposed to do
Every moment that I think I got through, that's where, where I found you
'Cause I don't wanna be your rock this time
I can't take away the pain from the world inside
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You're drowning in the sea with the wind inside
I can save you from yourself again tonight
I can be your rock, I can be your rock, no
I can be your rock, I can be your rock tonight
I tried to hold you, put you back together but I can't bend
The broken pieces, when they keep on breaking over again
A sea of lonely faces walking 'round this town
You think you're the only one who's ever been this down
Every moment that I think I got through, that's where, where I found you
'Cause I don't wanna be your rock this time
I can't take away the pain from the world inside
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You're drowning in the sea with the wind inside
I can save you from yourself again tonight
I can be your rock, I can be your rock, no
I can be your rock, I can be your rock tonight
