Shadows in this empty room
As I wake up dreams of you
You brought back that feeling
Made my heart stop beating
I miss your first steps down the house
Our memories hanging on the walls
There's always something missing
Without you here I'm just too damn sick
Well I'll do anything to get back anything of you

Nothing comes close, nothing feels right
No one can feel the space inside but you
I'm doing my best to make it through
I'm trying to move on, get you off my mind
But it just feels wrong leaving you behind
It's true, so tell me what the hell I'm supposed to do
'Cause I'm never gonna find another you

Who's gonna kiss my lips goodnight?
Who's gonna hold me when I cry?
'Cause I've seen love, I'll make it
Anyone else ' I'm just faking it
But do you ever think of me
And how damn good we used to be
Do you wish you can get it back
If you had the chance?
You might also like
Nothing comes close, nothing feels right
No one can feel the space inside like you
I'm doing my best to make it through
I'm trying to move on, get you off my mind
But it just feels wrong leaving you behind
It's true, so tell me what the hell I'm supposed to do
'Cause I'm never gonna find another you

'Cause I'm too wise than to get back everything, no

Nothing comes close, nothing feels right
No one can feel the space inside like you
I'm doing my best to make it through
I'm trying to move on, get you off my mind
But it just feels wrong leaving you behind
It's true, so tell me what the hell I'm supposed to do
'Cause I'm never gonna find another you

Never gonna find, never gonna find
I'm never gonna find, never gonna find
