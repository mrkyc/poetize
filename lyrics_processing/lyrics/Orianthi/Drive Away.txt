So baby, when you looked at me
Yeah, my world changed completely
You are the best thing
That is on my mind
So baby it's not hard to see
That I fell in love so completely
You are the best thing
That I have in my life

I've got the time, I've got the place, I've got this love for you
At this moment, don't you feel it, baby?
I know that it's gonna be the same
Away somewhere

So I said to you
"So baby, let's drive away
And leave this place now for one day
So baby, let's move tonight
It's the first day of the rest of our lives
Yeah, I just wanna run away
Turn my back
Erase all this pain now
Wouldn't it just be nice
To drive away and start again every time?"

So baby, we were meant to be

So you are the only one
The only one for me
So baby, when you take my hand
And we are on this road to forever
You are the best thing
That I have in my life

I've got the time, I've got the place, I've got this love for you
At this moment, don't you feel it, baby?
I know that it's gonna be the same
Away somewhere

So I said to you
"So baby, let's drive away
And leave this place now for one day
So baby, let's move tonight
It's the first day of the rest of our lives

Erase all this pain now
Wouldn't it just be nice

So baby, let's drive away
And leave this place now for one day
So baby, let's move tonight

So baby, let's drive away

To drive away and start again every time?

Run away, alright, alright
Tonight
Goodbye
Run, drive away
This is the best day, to the best day
