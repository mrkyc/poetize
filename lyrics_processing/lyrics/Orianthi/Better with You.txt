All by myself alright
Don't need nobody's help
Rolling on my own
So far I've had a pretty good time
I make the most
Of all life's giving
Yeah I toast
I'm cooler, I've seen
So far it's been one hell of a ride
Oh, I'm good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
I never saw it coming
Something's got me running
Never thought my life was missing something
Had it all together til you brought me heaven
I'm good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
Life's sweet
Sitting in the passenger seat
You got me laughing so hard that I can't breathe
And I feel more alive than a new york city street
Yesterday
Man I thought I had it made
But looking in your eyes the sun shines brighter
Everything's changed
My heart's on fire and you're to blame
You might also likeOh, I'm good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
I never saw it coming
Something's got me running
Never thought my life was missing something
Had it all together til you brought me heaven
I'm good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
I'm good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
I never saw it coming
Something's got me running
Never thought my life was missing something
Had it all together til you brought me heaven
I'm good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
I'm good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
I'm good but I'm better with you
So good but I'm better with you
