Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all (Missing you)
(Missing you) Since you've been gone away (Missing you)
I ain't missing you (Missing you)
(Missing you) No matter what I might say (Missing you, missing you, missing you)

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world, I have no meaning
I'm trying hard to understand

And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
You might also like
I ain't missing you at all (Missing you)
(Missing you) Since you've been gone away (Missing you)
I ain't missing you at all (Missing you)
(Missing you) No matter what I might say (Missing you)
No matter what our friends say (Missing you)

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Well, stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all (Missing you)
(Missing you) Since you've been gone away (Missing you)
I ain't missing you at all (Missing you)
(Missing you) No matter what I might say (Missing you, missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all (I ain't missing you)
(Missing you) Since you've been gone away (Missing you)
I ain't missing you at all (I ain't missing you)
(Missing you)
No matter what I might say
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you (I ain't missing you)
(Missing you)
(I ain't missing you)
(Missing you)
I ain't missing you (I ain't missing you)
(Missing you)
I ain't missing you (I ain't missing you)
(Missing you)
I ain't missing you (I ain't missing you)
(Missing you, missing you, missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you (I ain't missing you)
