I'm goin' to California
I got my bags by the door and I'm ready to leave
So yeah, I'm movin' forward
I'm on my way to findin' where I need to be

'Cause every moment now is what I believed somehow
Would be my reality
Alright now

'Cause there's no other feeling like it
The only way I can define it
It's that I'm on my own
It somehow feels like home
And there's no other feeling like it
It's so real that I can't deny it
I don't feel alone
It somehow feels like home

Walking in California
Making my way down Sunset Boulevard
Everyone looks familiar
So perfect like a picture from a magazine
You might also like
'Cause every moment now is what I believed somehow
Would be my reality
Alright now

'Cause there's no other feeling like it
The only way I can define it
It's that I'm on my own
It somehow feels like home
And there's no other feeling like it
It's so real that I can't deny it
I don't feel alone
It somehow feels like home

Failure never crossed my mind
I'll take a chance every time
And I will spread my wings, I will spread my wings
I've never been afraid to try
Putting everything on the line, on the line
Well, alright right now

'Cause there's no other feeling like it
It's so real that I can't deny it
I don't feel alone
It somehow feels like home
And there's no other feeling like it
It's so real that I can't deny it
I don't feel alone
It somehow feels like home
'Cause there's no other feeling like it
So real that I can't deny it
I don't feel alone
It somehow feels like home
'Cause there's no other feeling like it
So real that I can't deny it
I don't feel alone
It somehow feels like home
Somehow feels like home to me
Somehow feels like home
Mmm, mmm
Somehow feels like home to me
Walkin' in California
