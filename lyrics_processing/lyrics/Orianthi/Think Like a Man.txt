Must be you if the phone don't ring
Well, here I am, obsessing
Well, he loves me, well, he loves me not
I tell myself I should just learn to shut up
Well, I need to be like you

Ignore my emotions, emotions are dumb
Surf through the channels till my senses are numb
Shorten my attention span
I should think like a man
Stick my foot in my mouth and just run away
Turn off my cell, I ain't got nothing to say
Disappear and not give a damn
I should think like a man
I should think like a man

Oblivious, it must be nice
Nothing spoils your appetite
You're checking out every blonde in sight
Keep telling me that it's just so in my mind
Well, I want to be like you

Ignore my emotions, emotions are dumb
Surf through the channels till my senses are numb
Shorten my attention span
I should think like a man
Stick my foot in my mouth and just run away
Turn off my cell, I ain't got nothing to say
Disappear and not give a damn
I should think like a man
I should think like a man
You might also like
I could save myself so much trouble
I could save myself this heartache
But it's the best advice I know I'll never ever take

Yeah, I got to
I need to
I want to be like you

Ignore my emotions, emotions are dumb
Surf through the channels till my senses are numb
Shorten my attention span
I should think like a man
Stick my foot in my mouth and just run away
Turn off my cell, I ain't got nothing to say
Disappear and not give a damn
I should think like a man
I should think like a man
I should think like a man
