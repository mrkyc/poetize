S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the MCs rhyming on the funk
We solemnly swear; to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

Yeah! Yo, shock, it's a funky groove, man, it's kind of funky

You think so? I appreciate that, Hump

But yo player, how come you and Money B decided to call it?
Why did y'all name it 'Rhyming on the Funk', You know what I'm saying? (Well)
I mean, like, alright, if the beat is funk, and y'all was rapping over it
So obviously you're rhyming on the funk, you know what I'm saying?

Yeah, that's what I'm saying

So why would you even name a song like that?
It's obviously rhyming on the funk, it's like you're not trying to be creative

Yo Humpty man, if you want me to answer your question;
You gotta cool out and listen, alright? (Uh-huh)
Yo, I just named it "Rhyming on the Funk" we kind of..
We decided to call it that, because we know the beat's funky and everything
But it's, it goes.. (Ooh, dig it!) Listen! Just listen! it goes beyond that
The beat's funky but we wanted to let people know where the real funk came from
We didn't mean funk as in funky beats
We meant funk as in the Funk Mob, you know what I'm saying?
See Digital Underground LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like
Oh! Funk Mob? (Yeah)
What the hell is the Funk Mob, bunch a brothers don't take a bath? Ha, ha ha

No, no, Humpty, listen, man
Sometimes you act real dumb, you know what I'm saying?
(Oh, come on!) Funk Mob is like, you know;
All the new def producers who's doing the fly beats now
Like the Lynch Mob, the Bomb Squad (Yeah!) PMD, Dr. Dre (Oh! yeah)
They dropping all the hype new stuff, the Hip-Hop stuff
The Funk Mob was the old production crew man, you know what I'm saying?
The Funk Mob is Parliament, Funkadelic, Brides of Funkenstein
Freddie Wesley and the Horny Horns, George Clinton
And Bootsy Collins, you know what I'm saying?
Those kind of people..

Yo, I know those, I know all of them brothers, man

They laid the groundwork Humpty, you gotta give it up, man

Man, I know all of them brothers, man, I know... I heard Bootsy and George Clinton and them
But what I'm trying to say, is that it ain't really like that a new thing, man
The new stuff, the DJs and samplers and things, you got people like me saying
(They laid the groundwork) Stop what you're doing, you know what I'm saying?
(Nah!) it's just, it's a new phase
It ain't nothing like you trying to back there, it ain't
Humpty, be quiet, man, listen (Pffft.. be quiet)
You're not hearing what I'm saying
All the Hip-Hop stuff we doing now is BASED on what these brothers did
James Brown, all of these people (I know that, Shock)
You got to give credit where credit is due, you know what I'm saying?

I know this, man, yo, yo, yo, I'm giving credit, man
I'm giving credit, all I'm trying to say (No! You're not though)
See, you're making me upset, man! (You're not giving credit though!)
All I'm trying to say is; that it's cool but it ain't like the newer
Just I'm not from that time period (So What?)
And I don't understand all of that (You don't have to be)
And it ain't all that

Yo, you don't have to be from that time period to understand it
You know what I'm saying? (It's some of that!) NO-uh, it's all of that
(Psssh, aw, man) Not 'Just Knee Deep' Humpty!

Oh, uh, I didn't know the Funk Mob made 'Not Just Knee Deep' Oh! man!

Well, that's what it is! (Oh, shut up, man, shut up)
You ain't even up on nothing (Alright)
You ain't up on nothing! why don't you just.. (It's MOST of that!)
Huh? I'm not stupid; I heard you, you said it's Most of that
Cool, man, you finally gave it up, though!
Leave me alone, Shock! Leave me alone!

Right here.. Right here.. Right here!
