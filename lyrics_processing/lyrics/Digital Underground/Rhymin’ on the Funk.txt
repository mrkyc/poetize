S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

We really would like to ask you
Have you ever heard this style before?
You gotta say no
'Cause there ain't no denying
And if you say yes, you're lying
People are always wondering
What's up with the Underground
Are they down?
Or is just another new sound? (New sound)
We're saying things
And when we use a beat, we use it right
Because we're not just playing things
Spitting rhymes like a Tommy gun spraying things
So when you see us on stage, don't just stare us down
Or compare our sound
To any other crew ya like
Yo, judge how ya like, because we're

S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk (Shinin' on it)
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk (Look, we're rhymin' on it)
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk (Never bust a bunk style)
So listen to the way we're rhyming on the funk

Riding this like a roller coaster
Hugging the curves and dipping like I'm supposed to do
For the Underground troupe
'Cause I know I'm the poop
Steaming hot, stinking up the dance floor
Gonna do it freelance for the funk
My friends and all the others in the industry
They wanna get with me (Why is that, Mon?)
Maybe it's my smooth flow
They know this guy is dope
So they get hip to the style I'm using
It's called Raw Fusion
Ain't no time for ego-tripping
Let it be known
There'll be no slipping on mine
'Cause all I want is a chunk of this Underground funk, we're

S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk (Oh, shinin' on it)
And listen to the emcees rhymin' on the funk (Rhymin' on it, yeah)
We solemnly swear (Swear) to never bust a style that's bunk (Never, never bust a bunk style)
So listen to the emcees rhyming on the funk

Yo, Money-B (What's up, cold Shock G?)
Check it out, would you tell the people what we mean?
What do you mean what we mean?
You know what I mean, tell 'em what we mean
When we're R-H-Y-M-I-N on the funk
Let 'em know that we got spunk (We got it)
And when I count to three
Go on and hit some of that humpty-hump, one, two, three
Well, I'm humpty-humping
You know that I'm saying something
The funk's in your face, gonna keep the place jumping
As the beat keeps pumping
I'm tick-tocking 'em, dope rhymes, I'm dropping 'em
On the twenty-four track and there ain't no stopping 'em (Money B)
It's too late to put the tape on pause, because we're
Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk

Tell me if you think the beat is nasty
Well, get ready, we're gonna get sweaty
Just in case, I hope you brought a towel in
I'm on the prowl when I hear the bass growling
Growling like a big bass monster
On the rampage, it's like we were on stage
Shock G speaking from the Underground
Do they understand?
I really don't give a damn, 'cause we're

Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk

Rhymin' on the funk, rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk, rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk, rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk, rhymin' on the funk
Rhymin' on the funk
S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk (Oh, shinin' on it)
