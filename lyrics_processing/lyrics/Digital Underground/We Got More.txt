Grammy's, Emmy's that means nothin' to me
But when they rock us in the streets we say "Ooo-we"
You see the freak in the beat, she do me
I hit that Mitty-bitties wit the sticky ooey-gooey
I got more funk in my left in my left pinky toe
I got more soul in my style
Then they will ever know
I got more rhythm than I'll ever need to show
We got them groceries, bro
Yo, Luniz, let go

I got the flow so let the Luni man take over
Get deep into my hold
If ya lost, then picture gold
I heard styles that others stole
But it's no original flow
Like the Luniz and the man wit the nose

Notice my flows kick like a loaded Mac-11
Ghetto heaven, could climb wit mo 'Good Times' than James Evans
Glock wars
Media criticize 2Pac for
Homies in the hood, be strapped with goods and we've got more
See Digital Underground LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like
Didn't ya know
Our brothas got more
So check the new flow
Cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw
A lil sumpthin to roll to
Hold you, from the O-we-O-we-O

Got that voodoo runnin through my veins
Quiz: oppressed? Yes
Crazy? No, not insane
I smooth you through the menu then I make my order
I got that dominate gene
So if ya 'noid hide yo daughter
The love ya givin is based on what I do for you
For the right amount of money you probably let me boofoo you
I like to glide up in it, but I got my pride
Ain't no whore
Don't second guess yo man cuz he got more


Studio gangstas wanna battle, well let's battle
I blasted
They plastic ass get put underground wit the Fraggles
Snaggle tooth rhymers wit no flavor
Save a gang a neighbors
Then move away so they won't be called haters

Captain Save-A-Ho
Wop wop an away ya go
The "O" is too unfadeable

But don't trip, get a grip
Make ya own skit, be sure
Before you slide through the door
Cuz "We Got More"
 2x
Didn't ya know
Our brothas got more
So check the new flow
Cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh
Look how we throw
A lil sumpthin to roll to
Bump hoes to
