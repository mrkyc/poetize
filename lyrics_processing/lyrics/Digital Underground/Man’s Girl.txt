If you can't take me home with you
Then a lap dance will have to do
(Anybody got change for a twenty?)
If you can't take me home with you
Then a lap dance will have to do
If you can't take me home with you
Then a lap dance will have to do
(Mmm, shake it up, shake it up)
If you can't take me home with you
(Come on)

Yeah, I know it's rough out here, love
But we got your back

Give it up 'cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up 'cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world

Now tell me, can you tell the difference
Between a fast-tracking, skank-gaming tramp
And a man's girl
Kind of seems the same with just one glance (They do)
See, both of them cause erections from afar
But upon closer inspection it becomes clear (Say what?)
Money B gonna get you in there
See Digital Underground LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like
See, a clever girl knows
Not just hoes work them skirts that's mini
Prostitutes that dress this way
Try to imitate most of the Uptown (bitties)
But now, we don't really want to speak on all those girls who act real slutty
But we will talk about those man's girls
Those are the one we're studying

She's real secure, pretty toes pedicured
Baby got her own money
She thinks brothers who floss are funny
Ain't afraid to drink that honey
Off my body, feminist party issues she don't care about
Understands men well and knows the power of long hair

I doubt
If she'll fall for the type whose pants are tight on (His pookie)
Likes her sex fresh and fruity with the light on (That booty)

Give it up 'cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
(Can I get that puna'?)
Give it up 'cause she's a man's girl (Uh-huh)
She's struggling in a man's world (Punana, punana)

Ooh wee, she poppin', gotta be, got me jockin'
Even Nike and Reebok, the girl I'm talking about be rockin'
Them pumps with the toes out, super saucy when we go out
Or with her partners, she can blow clout
'Cause she's the sh..., no doubt
She's so about her scrill, that gives it all the more thrill
Can't lie, a little high
Couldn't get a better ride out of an automobile
Never make it hard to go chill
Let me do my thing, let a brother breathe
But she make it so convenient when she around
Now I don't ever want to leave

She's never stressing who
What I'm gon' do, how I've been riding with my crew
She says play on, ain't nothing wrong
As long as eventually I come home (Ooh, she cool)
When a brother finally do
The joke's on me 'cause she's gone
Taking care of she instead of worrying about me (Fa' shee'?)
For sheezy, she pleases me
Knowing that I got her back with what's important
Knowing that I'm down and that when I clown with my homies (Yeah)
It's a necessity, she gets to me, yes, I confess it
Secure with her intellect
Never afraid of flexing them hoe-ish dresses
Sex appeal drapes her whole vicinity
I'm hooked on, them girls when they get they look on, they get into me
Fingernails long
(Tummy showing)
Where you going, love?
(Can I be down?)
Can I be around?
When you gonna freak with the freaks of the industry?
If you can't take me home with you
(Come on, now)
Then a lap dance will have to do
(Get up on the table, baby, get on the table)
If you can't take me home with you
(Yeah, that's what I'm talking about)

Give it up 'cause she's a man's girl (Is she?)
She's bubbling in a man's world
(Can I get that puna'?)
Give it up 'cause she's a man's girl
(Punana)
She's struggling in a man's world
(Can I hit that puna?)
Give it up 'cause she's a man's girl
(Punana, punana)
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up 'cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world

And I appreciate it too, love
I love them shoes, love that dress
I love the whole program
I know you can't keep it up every day
But when you do I'm loving it, just like that
Now take 'em off
You deserve a foot massage
And I'm about to give it you, love
Can I get that puna? Punana, punana
Somebody give me change for a twenty
And get up on the table so we can do this
Oh no, I ain't giving you more than a dollar

Girl, don't stop that sexy groove (Sexy girl)
'Cause we like the way she move (Do your thing)
Girl, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move (Don't stop)
Girl, don't stop that sexy groove (Oh oh)
'Cause we like the way she move (Sexy girl)
Girl, don't stop that sexy groove (Do your thing)
'Cause we like the way she move
Girl, don't stop that sexy groove
'Cause we like the way she move
(Now get up on the back of the chair, love, right there)
Girl, don't stop that sexy groove (Don't stop)
'Cause we like the way she move (Don't you stop)
Girl, don't stop that sexy groove (Sexy girl)
'Cause we like the way she move (Do your thing)
Girl, don't stop that sexy groove (Watching you)
'Cause we like the way she move (Do your thing)

Can I hit that puna?
Do your thing, we like it, we like it, whoa-oh
Sexy girl, don't stop, don't stop, I'm watching you
No, don't stop that sexy groove
