So you've come from a long ways to go
Endowed with the flow and the destinies to grow
Into what you've come to be, the sons of the P

All that can be you be, sons of the P
Graduation is upon you...

Some say we're the sons of the preacher
Some says we're the sons of the prophet

Your present state of mind, you're happiness
You're spiritual creativity will be at its best
But first we must undress the clothes of society
Oh yes, we must undress the clothes of society
We're pulling down the pants to your mind
This time we'll make love to your intellect
The people in control are working very hard
To keep your natural desires in check
The things we bring will scatter sunshine in those times of rain
So enter near and have no fear and we'll set free the pain
Take me away, let me fly


Never bringing a short to you
A new candle wax for your jeep, doo doo
What you like as long as it's hype alright
And the doctor said you don't need a thing
We are here to let you flow
Raise your hands and let 'em go
Yes, we are the sons of the P
Take me away

And as you have grown into what you and only you can be
Sons of the P, go forth and funk 'em

Pack your bags, we're gonna take a trip
Don't watch your intuition, let your thought waves slip
To another level where the funk is fat
If I toast to the rhythm would you drink to that?
I won't try to judge, just letting you know
We need more sun if the P's gonna grow
We need more sun, sons of the flow

Endowed with the flow and the destinies to grow
Into what you've come to be, and only you can be sons of the P
As it is so shall it be the maximum izness
Graduation is upon you, go forth and funk 'em
Fuck 'em, just to see the look on their face
