Right now, I'm about to shake and bake (kick it)
Shake and bake

Once again we're taking over
The D-flow pimp rovers
The one who bent your summer lover over
The cool that's never sober but never hungover
With me the Rapanova, the big-noser
Poking around under your girlfriend's clothes
That's where the Humpty nose goes when the doors close
I never love her slow though
I flow like I'm on No-Doz
You don't belive me but your ho knows
A fly nucka when she sees one
I'm the one humping
Pumping out the premium
Super-octane, fat, crack beat kilos
Listen how the D flows
Rarrr rarrr like a dungeon dragon, nigga
AAAAGHHH!!
Like Monster Zero
Nah, I'm just bugging, y'all, Busta is my hero
I clown anyway, it's me though, yo
We got flavor and we like to flex it (ungh)
I'll be right back in a minute on some ol' sex shh--
On the next verse, yo, but first we must take
A second to wreck it and shake and bake
Come on!

Shake and bake, etc

Don't try to get away cuz baby this is it (it)
My freaky-deaky membership is legit
I got a sex club gold card veteran's certificate (what?)
You try to run I'll put my nose on your clit
Cuz I'm a master of the French kiss (kiss)
Nasty hoes know this (what?)
I'm a nut bust specialist (ungh)
A thriller of a lady killer
Whether chocolate or vanilla (bitch)
The butt-filler, the nut-spiller
I got a PhD in naassty
And, baby, when you walk past me
I'm gonna smell the flavor of that ass, G 
Smells like a freak to me
Cuz I'm a hardcore triple X-rater
Ho fader
Sick new position creator
Da mayor
The double up bubble butt slayer (ah ha)
Rock fat brown pipe layer
The joker, the butt poker
The ass cheek checker
The throat-choking tight coochie stretcher
The bust a nut double decker
Booty gettin heckler
The kinky ho closet freak
Sphincter muscle wrecker
You say you want to blow me?
Yo, baby, you really don't know me
Cuz like a DJ's hand on the crossfader
The Humpty nose up in your booty?
Shake-and-bakes like a vibrator!
Shake and bake, etc

Your beats are tired, your rhyming is fake
You keep on looping up them same old done breaks
Your buck teeth hang out of your face like a rake
