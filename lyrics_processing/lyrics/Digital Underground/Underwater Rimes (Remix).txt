Their breath, as we take you through an underwater hip hop extravaganza
Now last night, underwater, I saw a French mermaid
Treated her to caviar and wine over shrimp brain
In the raw, on the ocean floor, need I say more?
You never heard nobody kick it like this before
Pink champagne, octopus brains
Saw your DJ underwater through the window pane
That sucker tried to hit a mix, but the mix didn't happen
Records kept floatin' all the fish kept laughin'
A blowfish blew my mind and started to rhyme
As the octopus cut nine records at a time
Your boy said, "Show me how to keep my records down,"
But the shark ate his amp, your boy got clowned
The rhymes he say have no particular order
Un-derwater, Un-der-derwater
Go 'head bite his rhymes if you think that you oughtta
Hold your breath, MC's, my rhyme's underwater
I tried to mix a cut from a TV blooper
Got pulled by a deep sea state trooper
Told me that I didn't have the right to bite
I said, "Your wife looks just like a fat blue grouper."
Sittin' in my aqua-blue jail cell, didn't have my bail
I had to break out with the rhyme
Shrimp scatter on a platter, I rock like a mobster
Told an MC, "Yo, you look like a lobster"
Qualified to wreck your mind, I get busy one time
Like fish on a dish, you get served with the rhyme
...if you need a fo' instance
Watch the people stop, they don't want to miss this
I'm tweakin' your speakers, and I'm makin' no sense
Cause on your turns, this record burns like incense

Hold your breath, MC's, my rhyme's underwater
Uh, 1, 2, 1, 2, Yo, this is MC Blowfish
And we're gonna do a little something like this:
Well I'm a deep sea gangster, underwater prankster
Kissin' all the girl fish, dissin' all the ...
Because I blew your mind and started to rhyme
Doesn't mean that I'm cool, cause you'll be back next time
With a hook and a line, so you can hear that fryin' sound
I'm tellin' you I'm down
I'll spin your boat around, leave suckers lost in the bay
You wanna play? I'll hook your line to a stingray
Get out of here with that boat and a stick
Get out of line, I'll call my homey Moby Dick
I'm not thinkin' 'bout dyin', fool, stop tryin' to test me
People fishin' don't catch me
And when you get home, sad cause you missed
Just remember MC Blowfish
Keep on, you don't stop
