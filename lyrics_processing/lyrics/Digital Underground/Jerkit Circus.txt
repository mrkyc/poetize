Them that do and them that do

Yo
They got tigers, lions, and monkeys
But I give my most attention to my donkey
Pay no mind to the sign that said: don't feed it
Even hold it when it's time to get funky
Always tired after two rounds of action
But you got to bust three like Paxon
So you go off and you join the Jerkit Circus
Work it like you knock a bag, that's satisfaction

So let's talk about this
And that
I'm a freaky deak player but I'm scared that it might be wack (wack)
It might hurt my sack (sack)
And if it ain't cool then I'm not gonna kiss that cat (cat)
Cuz I don't know where it's been at
Sometimes it ain't cool even when you wear a hat
But yo I hit it anyway (unngh)
Cuz a diesel butt female wanted to play
And three days later got an itch
And now I really wanna kill that (HO!)
Who did it
I shouldn't have been with it
I really shouldn't have hit it (did it)
But I slipped and I admit it ('mit it)
I did it (hit it)
But it didn't have to be done
Next time I'm gonna run run run to the

Hey yo it's time to milk the cow

Mary goes up and Mary goes down
Mary goes Mary goes round and round
She rolled on a horse that was wearing a hat
POP went the ball sack
Mary goes up and Mary goes down
Mary goes Mary goes round and round
But this time the horse wasn't wearing no hat
DEAD went the ball sack

How did you get strung when she looked at you
(And that's how she hookeded you)
Sitting in the back when you knew you wasn't strapped
And that's how the microwave cooked you
You ROCKED and SHOCKED it
Knocked up the booty real good when you knew you should have
STOPPED and BLOCKED it
With a hat
I stay strapped cuz I'm smarter than that
So let's work

Called your girl
Tried to get your rocks off
Made you wait
Your hard rock got soft (aakh!)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I don't know I wish I knew a better way
Cuz back in the day
You step to a lot a girls and they say back off a lot
You get mad wanting tail, jack off a lot
But hey it's not such a bad idea considering
Don't have to waste a lot a time trying to get her in
The mood
AND YOU NEED NO PROTECTION
Word to the dick what else it's got is no affection
The sex was great and you didn't have to ball her
And hear her nagging asking you if you was gonna call her
So now I'm going out like a strangler
Get a grip and choke your fadangler
To the girls that use sex to try to work us:
Took my destiny into my own hand
