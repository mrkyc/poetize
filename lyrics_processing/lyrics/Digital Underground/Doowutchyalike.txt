Ooh, I see guys and girls dancing, ooh, ooh

Now as the record spins around, you recognize this sound
Well, it's the Underground
You know that we're down with what you like
Yeah, with what you like, yeah
And though we're usually on the serious tip, check it out:
Tonight we're gonna flip and trip and let it all hang out tonight
We're gonna say what we like
Cause, yo, yo, we wanna know how many people in the floor
Would like to just let yourselves go
And do what you like
Yeah, well tonight's your night
 Just eat food, try not to be crude or rude
Kill the attitude, chill the serious mood
And do what you like
Yeah, and doowutchyalike
Everybody doowutchyalike

See Digital Underground LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like I mean rich, poor, high, low, or upper-middle class
Let's all get together and have a few laughs
And do what we like
Yeah, and do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move
Do what you like
Sometimes I bite
 Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
Messed up the line?
Nope, sometimes I don't rhyme
Help yourself to a cracker, with a spread of cheddar cheese
Have a neck bone, you don't have to say please
Eat what you like, yo, smell how you like
Everybody doowutchyalike

 Just act a fool, it's okay if you drool
Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
 Homegirls, for once, forget you got class
See a guy you like: just grab 'im in the biscuits!
And do what you like
 Now, red, white, black, tan, yellow, or brown
It really doesn't matter, we can all get down
And do what we like, yeah, and do what we like
From a pink-skinned Yankee, to a blue-black Southerner
Ditch digger or a governor
Just do what you like
Look how you like
 Now don't you know we're getting busy, it can't be corrected
Shake it, had to be def
I say what I like
Like I said, sometimes we bite
Even though you don't think it's right
Yo, I like to bite
Just have fun y'all, and if you think that it's wrong
You got to admit, it's a new type of song
Doowutchyalike

 Alright, here we go, y'all:
Do what you like
Talk how you like
Drink what you like
Grab who you like
Feel what you like
Eat what you like
Scratch where you like
Itch if you like
 Daddy, can I go outside?
 Ha, go where you like, kid!

Ah, ah, ah, I feel like a nice big bowl of cereal, icy cold milk
 Daddy, can I eat some ice cream?
 Look, I told you kid, eat what you like, OK?
 Now the beat goes on 'til the break of dawn
And just peep this, y'all, cause we're singing a song
And do what you like, yeah do what you like

 Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
 And do what you like
 Stetsasonic's not just for the hip-hop fans
And since we're not your average everyday rap band
Yo, Piano Man, play how you like
 Just act a fool -- it's okay if you drool
Cause everybody's gonna strip and jump in the pool
...Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't take your clothes off yet, not yet --
Wait 'til we get home
 Now if you wear corrective shoes and you got big bunions
Toenails smell and look like onions
Don't doowutchyalike--
Go see a foot doctor tonight!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody doowutchyalike

 Straight hair, curled, casual or glamor
 A shy girl, or loud like a bama
 From Connecticut, or from Louisiana
 Bad table etiquette, too much chatter
 Very well spoken or real bad grammar
 A minority token, a brother in the slammer
 A free civilian with a house in Santa Ana
 If you got a million and living in Atlanta
 If you got a weak bladder or can't climb a ladder
 What we're saying is, it really doesn't matter
 I need a word that sounds like "Ana"
 Slipped on a peel of banana
Doowutchyalike
 Yeah, cold getting stupid
 Once again, you got the sound of the Underground
Baby Dope is in the house
 Boyyy!!
 Are we puttin' things in check, Baby D?
 Too stupid check
 I'm wit' it. Yo Dave, let's show 'em some old school
It makes no sense just standing around
Come on everybody, let's all...
Yeah, and do what we like
 From a lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
Come on, young ladies, let's have 
 And do what we like
 Now I can sing, I can dance, I'm the king of romance
Are you sweet young ladies gonna give me a chance
To do what you like
 And get that thing packed tonight?
 Vanessa Williams, ooh, you're so divine
Just wanted to put your name in my rhyme
And doowutchyalike
Yeah, everybody doowutchyalike
