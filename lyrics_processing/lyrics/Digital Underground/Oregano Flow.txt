- Yeah, getting high off the soup, (drink it up)
A little high belongs to me
- Top Ramen's how we're coming with the loop, (sip it down)
A little high belongs to you
- A dab of this, dab of that, not too heavy on the garlic, (take it easy)
A little high belongs to me
- With just a touch of oregano
Now everybody's funking but they don't know how
They wasn't down back when the bull funked the cow
But the chest of the cow was vestless
So the stank from the D-thang bang left them breathless
Oregano flow
Don't waste your time sticking out your chest, for no
Reason: its the season for the lovely flow:
The 'D', we're sick enough of stress, let it go
Now follow as I slip into the butter melody
This is the part I take your heart and leave your vision blurry
So try to focus on my dope
And I suggest you invest in a telescope;
As I come with hella rhythm, move closer to your television
Catch a look just like a hooker catch j-izm
Even with bifocals for your ears, you still couldn't see me though
As I flavour up this vide' like oregano:
Slinging them nouns and verbs
You couldn't hear me with binoculars
I guess I'm kind of different cause I do love them hoes
Only not the same way that I love my niggaroes
Cause I love it when they say something fly
The ill caps make me laugh till I cry
Some fries and some freaks and it's on, all night long
I love to see my homies living strong
But that cook with the cloudy cookbook
Rained salt on another brother's sunny day
I wonderin' if we're really happy here
With this lonely G game we play

Now everybody's looking but they cannot see
The 'D' because we're future and we're too slippery
You know we're coming with oregano flow
Don't waste your time sticking out your chest, for no
Reason it's the season for the lovely flow:
The 'D', we're sipping off the stress, let it go, let it go
Top Ramen's how we're coming with the loops
Oregano, baby, oregano

A little high belongs to me
- Top rhyming's how we're coming, bye-bye
