I really can't stay
I've got to go away
This evening has been
So very nice
My mother will start to worry
My father will be pacing the floor
So, really, I'd better scurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more, more
The neighbors might think
(Baby, it's bad out there)
Hey, what's in this drink?
(No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how
(Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
(Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna tell 'em I tried
(What's the sense in hurting my pride?)

I really can't stay
(Baby, don't hold out!)
Oh, but it's cold outside!

Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go
Yeah, the answer is no
No, no, this welcome has been
So nice and warm, yeah
(Look out the window at that storm)
My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to the fireplace roar)
My sister will be suspicious
(Gosh, your lips look delicious)
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
(Never such a blizzard before)
Oh, I got to get home
(Baby, you'll freeze out there)
Oh, well, lend me your coat
(It's up to your knees out there)
Oh, you've really been grand
(I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see?
(How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
(Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied
(If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay
(Get over that, hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside

Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside
(Everybody knows)
Baby, it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold
