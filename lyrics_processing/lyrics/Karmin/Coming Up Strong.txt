Why you cryin'? It's okay now
If I hold you, will you calm down?
It's your way with words that can make me burn
When you say it, do you mean it?
When I shout out, can you hear me?
When it's all too much, look at what we've done

That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
Comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up, oh
Now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
Singin' our song, gettin' lost to the sound
Once I was lost, now I'm found
Shinin' through the dark, can't hold us down
That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
Comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up, oh
Now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
Singin' our song, gettin' lost to the sound
Once I was lost, now I'm found
Shinin' through the dark, can't hold us down

Call me ruthless, we've been through this
Who's to blame now? Babe, it's useless
'Cause it's no one's fault if the lights were off
When we're shinin', then we're flyin'
Through the wheelhouse that we're grindin'
When it's all too much, look at what we've done

That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
Comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up, oh
Now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
Singin' our song, gettin' lost to the sound
Once I was lost, now I'm found
Shinin' through the dark, can't hold us down
That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
Comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up, oh
Now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
Singin' our song, gettin' lost to the sound
Once I was lost, now I'm found
Shinin' through the dark, can't hold us down

So easy we forget and say
Clouds are movin' in, rain starts to fall again
But as soon as you tell me it's okay

That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
Comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up, oh
Now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
Singin' our song, gettin' lost to the sound
Once I was lost, now I'm found
Shinin' through the dark, can't hold us down
That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
Comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up, oh (So strong)
Now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
Singin' our song, gettin' lost to the sound (Strong)
Once I was lost, now I'm found
Shinin' through the dark, can't hold us down
Why you cryin'? It's okay now
If I hold you, will you calm down?
