Louis XIII and it's all on me, honey, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot, I call the shots, shots, shots
Like brap, brap, brap
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot

Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me
Pay me what you owe me

Turn up to Rihanna while the whole club gettin' wasted
Every time I drive by, I am the only thing you're playin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rearview mirror racin'
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Like brap, brap, brap
You might also like
Louis XIII and it's all on me, baby, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze if you think that you gonna knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot, I call the shots, shots, shots
Like brap, brap, brap
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot
