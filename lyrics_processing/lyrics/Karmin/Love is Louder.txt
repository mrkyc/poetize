But your heart has all the power
Don't you know your love is louder, babe?
Let them yell, point and tell
But your heart has all the power
Don't you know your love is louder?

Days go by and what I learned
Try to help, but make it worse
Count your blessings once the damage is done
All the strangers and their friends
Starting battles we can't win
Childish dreams we once believed in are gone

All the headlines that I read
Say the world is gonna bleed
And nothin' you do gonna stop it now
Gonna stop it now, you know
But I would like to live my life
Countin' steps to paradise
I know it can't be far

Even though the world can snuff your fire
Words cut you down, steal your crown
Even though the world can make you tired
Even though the world can hurt your pride
But your heart has all the power
Don't you know your heart can take you higher?
Don't you know your love is louder, babe?
Even though the world can snuff your fire
Let them yell, point and tell
Even though the world can make you tired
Even though the world can hurt your pride
But your heart has all the power
Don't you know your heart can take you higher?
Don't you know your love is louder?
You might also like
Even though the world can snuff your fire
Even though the world can make you tired
Even though the world can hurt your pride
Don't you know your heart can take you higher?

If you walk beside me now
Lift the load a couple pounds
Heavy hearts could never slow us down
Join the movement, let them talk
Move the mountains, let them watch
Never been a better time than now

Cause all the headlines that I read
Say the end is guaranteed
And nothin' you do gonna stop it now
Gonna stop it now, you know
But I would like to live my life
Countin' steps to paradise
I know it can't be far

Even though the world can snuff your fire
Words cut you down, steal your crown
Even though the world can make you tired
Even though the world can hurt your pride
But your heart has all the power
Don't you know your heart can take you higher?
Don't you know your love is louder, babe?
Even though the world can snuff your fire
Let them yell, point and tell
Even though the world can make you tired
Even though the world can hurt your pride
But your heart has all the power
Don't you know your heart can take you higher?
Don't you know your love is louder?
Even though the world can snuff your fire
Even though the world can make you tired
Even though the world can hurt your pride
