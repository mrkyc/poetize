Who do you think you are, a super S-T-A-R?
Who do you think you are? You can kiss my oh my gah!

All eyes on you tonight
So let's toast to you, you got so much to prove
And you say, everyone's got a price
That's how you get your way
If not, there's hell to pay

You're gonna huff and puff and blow the whole house down
Don't they know, you're the king of the castle
The nerve of some people
To think we're all equal
911, it's me to the rescue
If I don't speak, who's gonna tell you?
Oh yeah, I gotta let you know

I'm here to crash your party
You think you're the star of the show
But I'm about to let you know
I'm here to crash your party
The bigger you are, the harder you fall, oh you had it all
Before I crashed your party

Who do you think you are, a super S-T-A-R?
Who do you think you are, you can kiss my oh my gah!

You're so misunderstood
'Cause you're so complex, you and your complex
And you claim you're so low key
Well, you coulda fooled me, Mr. TMZ!

Come on show 'em how you huff and puff and blow the whole house down
Don't they know you're the king of the castle?
The nerve of some people
To think we're all equal
911, it's me to the rescue
If I don't speak, who's gonna tell you?
Oh yeah, I gotta let you know

I'm here to crash your party
You think you're the star of the show
But I'm about to let you know
I'm here to crash your party
The bigger you are, the harder you fall, oh you had it all
Before I crashed your party
Who do you think you are, a super S-T-A-R?
Who do you think you are? You can kiss my oh my gah!

Sittin' on top of the world, you got the best view
Livin' life with a cheat sheet, nobody test you, huh?
Your mind is a mess, heart is a chess piece
Movin' down the board, now I'm takin' down the king of the castle
When I'm on top of this beat I dazzle
How could you ever conceive I'd razzle up - 'nuff of that beef
Now I'm gonna tweak out - now you better peace out
'Cause I gotta full house, yeah baby
Four of a kind
There's no room in my life for an ego your size

I'm here to crash your party
You think you're the star of the show
But I'm about to let you know
I'm here to crash your party
The bigger you are, the harder you fall, oh you had it all
