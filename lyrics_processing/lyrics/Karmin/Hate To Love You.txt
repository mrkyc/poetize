I'm just a prisoner of your love
You got me lip-locked, fire the gun, oh
If I escaped you, I would be lost
So don't bail me out, babe, I'll pay the cost, oh

Uh, see, it ain't that sunny, spent my money
Sweet as a felony, ain't you, honey?
I can hear the bribes, but I'm wearin' stripes
Look up at the stars and I gotta think twice
All of the fighting, keeps it exciting

I'm doin' time but I don't mind, I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I don't mind, I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time, it's a real fight, but it's alright
Sometimes I just hate to love you

You cuffed me up and treated me cold
I threw the key out a long time ago, oh
If you released me, I wouldn't leave (Whoa)
So don't feed me poison, I gotta eat, oh
You might also like
Yo, be my cellmate, plan our escape
Tell me when you're ready, we can storm the front gate
Fool the jail keeper, real deep sleeper
No big deal, just misdemeanor
All of the fighting keeps it exciting

I'm doin' time but I don't mind, I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I don't mind, I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time, it's a real fight, but it's alright
Sometimes I just hate to love you

See, I don't need the bars to lock me in
You can let your guard down 'til the end
Forever doesn't happen overnight
And that's why
I'm doin' time, but I don't mind, I'll be just fine
I'm doin' time, but I don't mind, I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you

I'm doin' time but I don't mind, I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I don't mind, I'll be just fine
Sometimes I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time, it's a real fight, but it's alright
