After all you did to me
You left me standing in debris
But, yeah, I'd take you back
You know I always take you back
Had the heart to let you go
But now it's strictly physical
And knockin' at my door
Gettin' harder to ignore

Where's the referee to blow the whistle, please?
Stop this cruelty, 'cause I won't leave here without you, no

Even though I watched you go crazy
You can't live without me, baby
You can't live without me, baby, oh
Even though I watched you go crazy
You can't live without me, baby
You can't live without me, baby

Heard a whisper 'cross the town
The news about us gets around
But I'm alone with you
So there's nothing I can do
You might also likeRight and wrong is blurry now
My friends have gone, I'm blacking out
The most that I can take
Is right before I break

Where's the referee to blow the whistle, please?
Stop this cruelty cause I won't leave here without you, no

Even though I watched you go crazy
You can't live without me, baby
You can't live without me, baby, oh
Even though I watched you go crazy
You can't live without me, baby
You can't live without me, baby

Stupid-ass lies, stupid-ass pain
This is my fight, this is my shame
Knew you were mine, as soon as I got a taste
Stupid-ass lies, stupid-ass pain
This is my fight, this is my shame
Now that I know, I know that I'm not alone
Even though I watched you go crazy
You can't live without me, baby
You can't live without me, baby, oh
Even though I watched you go crazy
You can't live without me, baby
You can't live without me, baby

Even though I watched you go crazy
(Stupid-ass lies, stupid-ass pain)
Even though I watched you go crazy
(This is my fight, this is my shame)
Even though I watched you go crazy
(Now that I know, I know that I'm not alone)
