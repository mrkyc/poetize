Whatever you do, just don't forget about me
Don't forget about me, don't forget about me

I want more adventure
I've been bored forever, my dear
This town drags me under
There's just nothin' left for me here

Drew blood in rebellion
I'm no longer welcome, alright
Here's both middle fingers
It's my revolution tonight

I'm leavin', I'm leavin', I'm leavin'
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not takin' no suitcase
Anywhere but here is gonna fit me just fine
I'm leavin', I'm leavin', I'm leavin'
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not takin' no suitcase
Anywhere but here I'm gonna have a good time
You might also like
Feels good startin' over
Why don't you come with me
Believe we'll be good for somethin'
I'll be Thelma, you be Louise

Either way, I just can't stay here
New game, different players I know
I'll walk if I have to
Goodbye, it's time for me to get the hell out

I'm leavin', I'm leavin', I'm leavin'
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not takin' no suitcase
Anywhere but here is gonna fit me just fine
I'm leavin', I'm leavin', I'm leavin'
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not takin' no suitcase
Anywhere but here I'm gonna have a good time

Whatever you do, just don't forget about me
Whatever you do, just don't forget about me
Whatever you do, just don't forget about me
Don't forget about me, don't forget about me
Whatever you do, just don't forget about me
Don't forget about me, don't forget about me

Bringin' me into the future, I wanna be tight
Don't loosen me up with a Mesopotamian life
Like, I love you to death, but I want you to know that you're wrong
Wherever the wild ones are goin' is where we belong
And even if everyone waves us, and money enslaves us
I know we will go hard to the end, like Magellan behaves us
And even if nothin' can save us, well, I still prefer brave us
Let's work till they the grave us
No limit to where this fire can take us!

I'm leavin', I'm leavin', I'm leavin'
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not takin' no suitcase
Anywhere but here is gonna fit me just fine
I'm leavin', I'm leavin', I'm leavin'
Don't you try to stop me
I'm not takin' no suitcase
Anywhere but here I'm gonna have a good time

Whatever you do, just do just don't forget about me
