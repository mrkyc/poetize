I was fishin' for a real good man (Oh)
Any second 'bout to reel one in (Oh)
A little bait and I had one hooked (Oh)
I threw him back, he was no good
Why you stressin' me boy? (Oh)
Blowin' up my line, are you testin' me, boy? (Oh)
I ain't gonna give you the best of me, boy (Oh)
If gleamin' is a crime you arrestin' me, boy - let me be, boy
Yeah, I'm settin' sail for the deep blue sea (Oh)
Cruisin' with my girls, got my anchor ready (Oh)
I saw you jumpin' 'round and you caught my eye, oh-oh-oh (Oh)
My, translate that, he was super fine, one of a kind
And now he's making me sweat, my match has been met (Oh)
He's playing hard to get so I'm casting my net (Oh)
I hope it's worth the while, don't make me regret (Oh)

I ain't trippin' 'cause I let one go (Oh)

Can't let a man pull me down (Oh)
I stay afloat so I won't drown
Oh, you rockin' my boat (Oh)
Puttin' up a fight 'cause I'm lettin' you go (Oh)
Now you wanna stay when you wanted to be free (Oh)
Runnin' 'round town with a chick who ain't me, you're such a guppy
I know I'm a little fish in a big pond (Oh)
Maybe time to cast my reel beyond (Oh)
You had me fooled with your big game, now who's to blame? (Oh)
Turned out that you were super lame, put me to shame
And now I gotta move upstream to find the man of my dreams
The next one to add to my team, my baby (Oh)
Checkin' out my line to see what I caught (Oh)

I used to cry over heartbreak when I didn't know better
One thing that my mama told me changed my life forever
She said: "The man is a dime a dozen
Baby girl, don't cry for nothing
Little girl, you should go and have fun
And if you caught one you can catch another one"
