A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So (no)

I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time (no)

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
Oh, whoa-oh, oh

When a scrub is checkin' me
And his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
When he's lookin' like trash and I'm lookin' like class
Can't get with no deadbeat ass
So (no)
You might also like
I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time (no)

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride...

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yeah, son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your mama
Oh yeah, son, I'm talking to you
You have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yeah, son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no...

No scrub (no no no, no no)
No scrub (no, no)
No scrub (no no no no)
Yo, yo
I don't wanna scrub ya, I don't wanna bum rush
You about to get dumped, don't forget to flush, ha
Bubbles burstin' all around, the water's luke warm
Now I know it's not safe to shower in a thunder storm
But I gotta come clean somehow
Gotta get my scrubbin' bubbles out
Look at the mess you made, holy cow - wow
I'mma really need ya to listen this time around
And I'mma really need ya to glisten before you put it down on me
Yeah, I saw you last week hangin' with your friends
Talkin' lots of trash in a layaway Benz
Don't try to call, don't try to creep
Even if your money's right I know we wouldn't last a week

No scrub (no no)
No scrub (no, no, no no baby, oh)
No scrub (no no)
No scrub, no scrub (no, no!)

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
