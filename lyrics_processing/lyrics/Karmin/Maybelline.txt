I see a picture-perfect world
Seems like I can't escape it
Each girl, the writings on the wall
Tells me to face the music

I can't compete, although I try to fall below the surface
Bright lights are never what they seem
You've got to see in person

I don't know what they see when they look at me
I don't care, but they all see it differently
I don't know what they see when they look at me
But, I can hear 'em say

Go, Vogue for you life like you must be seen
Pose like the pictures in the magazines
Yeah, beauty is pain, but the pleasure's free
Born to be loved like a Maybelline

Look what the Photoshop made up
Now, shop the photo's makeup
We learn at such an early age:
Admire, but don't be jealous
You might also like
I don't know what they see when they look at me
I don't care, but they all see it differently
I don't know what they see when they look at me
But, I can hear 'em say

Go, Vogue for you life like you must be seen
Pose like the pictures in the magazines
Yeah, beauty is pain, but the pleasure's free
Born to be loved like a Maybelline
Go, Vogue for you life like you must be seen
Pose like the pictures in the magazines
Yeah, beauty is pain, but the pleasure's free
Born to be loved like a Maybelline

I saw a pretty girl by the side of the road
Thumb up in the air and a winter coat
I knew that she was carryin' a heavier load
And, I thought that I could get her where she wanted to go
Yeah, she looked so good with a dangerous style
And, I liked the way she talked with a magical smile
She said, "I could be a star if the planets aligned."
So, I took her on a ride to deliver the shine
I don't know what they see when they look at me
I don't care, but they all see it differently
I don't know what they see when they look at me
But, I can hear 'em say

Go, Vogue for you life like you must be seen
Pose like the pictures in the magazines
Yeah, beauty is pain, but the pleasure's free
Born to be loved like a Maybelline
Go, Vogue for you life like you must be seen
Pose like the pictures in the magazines
Yeah, beauty is pain, but the pleasure's free
