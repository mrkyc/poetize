I always knew that you would leave
The world was telling you to come and claim it
You took a one way on the 10th
And I don't know if you'll be back again
Yeah, you say you wanna make it big, oh
This city's made of silly dreams and heartbreak
They live their lives in black and white
But your true colors saturated my heart

So if it rains on your parade
I'm coming with a marching band to back you up
Nobody left to entertain
Then play our favorite tune
I got you, babe
And if the clouds roll in again
I'm coming with a rescue crew to pull you out
No matter bus, train, boat or plane
There's nothing I won't do
I got you
I got you, babe

This town could never understand, oh no
You're still the topic of the conversation
There's quite a bit of slowing down
And pointing fingers by your parents house
Yeah, yeah, alright
You might also likeI see your face on the TV... screen
I know it's just the start of something bigger
I know we'll always be in touch
But I still miss you when I drink too much!

So if it rains on your parade
I'm coming with a marching band to back you up
Nobody left to entertain
Then play our favorite tune
I got you, baby, oh!
And if the clouds roll in again
I'm coming with a rescue crew to pull you out
No matter bus, train, boat or plane
There's nothing I won't do
I got you
I got you, babe

I got you, you got me
Oh, nothing we can't do
I got you, baby
I got you, you got me
Oh, nothing we can't do
I got you, baby
And when it rains on your parade
I'm coming with a marching band to back you up
Nobody left to entertain
Then play our favorite tune
I got you, baby, oh
And if the clouds roll in again
I'm coming with a rescue crew to pull you out
No matter bus, train, boat or plane
There's nothing I won't do
I got you, baby, oh
And if the clouds roll in again
I'm coming with a rescue crew to pull you out
No matter bus, train, boat or plane
