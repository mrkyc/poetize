You said I had it all
You said it took no brains
You promised all the stars
And then you took the reins
I watched it all come down
You set my dreams ablaze
I saw the meteor
Coming from far away

Every word you say is made to please
Oh, I better watch out
Everyone's got faces no one sees

Well, I guess I didn't know you at all, hey
No, no, I guess I didn't know you at all, hey
Oh, before we fly we have to fall
I guess I didn't know you at all

I made it out alive
A couple bruises fade
And so I cover up
And wear a smiley face
I had to sell my car
And gather up my things
I heard you're on to the next
So they can kiss your rings
You might also like
Everyone's got faces no one sees
Oh, they better watch out
Every word you say is made to please

Well, I guess I didn't know you at all, hey
No, no, I guess I didn't know you at all, hey
Oh, before we fly we have to fall
I guess I didn't know you at all

Like a bird of the prey
Out of nowhere you came
Do you always get your way?
Like a bird of the prey
Out of nowhere you came
Do you always, do you always get your way?

Every word you say is made to please
I better watch out
Everyone's got faces no one sees

I guess I didn't know you at all, hey
No, no, I guess I didn't know you at all, hey
Oh, before we fly we have to fall
I guess I didn't know you at all
No, no, I guess I didn't know you at all
(Like a bird of the prey)
I guess I didn't know you at all
(Out of nowhere you came)
Before we fly we have to fall
I guess I didn't know you at all
(Do you always get your way?)
Like a bird of the prey
Out of nowhere you came
Do you always get your way?
Like a bird of the prey
Out of nowhere you came
