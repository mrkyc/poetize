Oh, if I want it, I'm gonna get it
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
Oh, if I want it, I'm gonna get it
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'

Future in my hands, gotta make it count
Convince yourself, it's feasible and then there's nothin' else
Sick addiction, dangerous mind
Put it on command, error undefined
Even when you got a shadow of doubt
Even when a hundred people tell you it's a wipeout
You gotta do it big, you gotta do it strong
At the end of the day, you're the one who's in the wrong
Regrettin' and forgettin' everything you worked for
Instead of trend settin' and bettin'
It's so upsettin', I'm sweatin now
And I can't believe it, it should be so easy, oh
Already got a knack, just dial it back
The window's open and the world is yours, go attack
'Cause when the wind is right and the tide is high
Then it's time to fly

Oh, if I want it, I'm gonna get it
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
Oh, if I want it, I'm gonna get it
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'

I know, know, know where to go, go, go
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Know, know, know where to go, go, go
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Did you ever think "I'll do what I want?"
Me in the marathon, ha, one in the front
Now you're makin' plans, don't let them screw it up
Better write your name on it, paper cup
Most people afraid of hearing no
Got booed off stage once, Apollo
I can do anything that I wanna do
And I'll take that 'cause it's not for you
Took a few years to surface, but now it's so bizurkus
And I'm ring leadin' in this circus
I'm just sayin' I'm just slayin'
And pavin' the road ahead of me
Bravin' the elements and watchin' it cave in
My heart is racin' and palpitatin', I'm so done anticipatin'
It's all good, yeah, made up my mind
Threadin' the needle is part of our design

Oh, if I want it, I'm gonna get it
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
Oh, if I want it, I'm gonna get it
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
I know, know, know where to go, go, go
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Know, know, know where to go, go, go
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Oh, if I want it I know I'm gonna get it
I'm just sayin' that's the way that it goes
Oh, if I want it I know I'm gonna get it
I'm just sayin' that's the way that it goes

And if we look at life, I'ma tell you what
You only get one, we bein' honest, huh?
Let 'em tell you no, we on another plane
Approachin' destination, hit the main vein
Now we glidin', windin'
Tryin' not to crash 'cause we so high, gotta keep grindin'
Not a limit, we drivin' the ship, we runnin' it all

Oh, if I want it, I'm gonna get it
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
Oh, if I want it, I'm gonna get it
And I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
I know, know, know where to go, go, go
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Know, know, know where to go, go, go
