Too caught up in the moment, fantasy is gone
Came down from the high
Stare me down with the tension of a thousand daggers
Are you surprised?

Here comes the ache, too much to take
You got to let it go (Let it go)
Give me a break, it's my mistake
Darling, I should've known (should've known)

I couldn't help it, sorry I'm selfish
But blame it on my heart
Blame it on the beating
No alibi, I had to try, baby
Blame it on my heart
Blame it on my beating heart

Trust I wanted to tell you
No, I never meant for you to be hurt
Tongue-tied-up my escape plan
Now I got a million bridges to burn
You might also like
Here comes the ache, too much to take
You got to let it go (Let it go)
Give me a break, it's my mistake
Darling, I should've known

I couldn't help it, sorry I'm selfish
But blame it on my heart
Blame it on the beating
No alibi, I had to try, baby
Blame it on my heart
Blame it on the beating

All the things I said
Cross them out in red, honey
Blame it on my heart
Blame it on the feeling
Don't make it worse
I can't reverse it so
Blame it on my heart
Blame it on my beating heart

Blame it on the feeling (Blame it, blame it, blame it)
Don't make it worse now
Blame it on the beating (Blame it, blame it)
All the things I said
Na na na, na na, na na (na, na)
Na na na, na na, na na, na (na, na)
Na na na, na na, na na (na, na)
Na na na, na na, na na

I couldn't help it, sorry I'm selfish
But blame it on my heart
Blame it on the beating
No alibi, I had to try, baby
Blame it on my heart
Blame it on the beating

All the things I said
Cross them out in red, honey
Blame it on my heart
Blame it on the feeling
Don't make it worse
I can't reverse it so
Blame it on my heart
