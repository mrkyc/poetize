I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock your body (oooh)
Damn I like the way that you move
So give it to me (oooo oooh)
Cause I already know what you wanna do
Here's the situation
Been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation
Given my reputation
Please excuse me I don't mean to be rude
But tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm lovin' you
Oh you know
That tonight I'm lovin' you
You're so damn pretty
If I had a type than baby it'd be you
I know your ready
If I never lied, than baby you'd be the truth
