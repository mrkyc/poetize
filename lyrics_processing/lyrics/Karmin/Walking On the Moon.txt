My mind is blown
Lose all control
Cut me loose
Uh, uh, uh

Feeling like I got my MJ shoes on, can we get a move on?
Let's go on a beach walk, pick us up some moon rocks
Anytime you wanna stop I can make the stars
Spotlight on the dance floor, what do we got the DJ for?
Just left Earth, now we on our way to Pluto
Call it what you want, we the daring-est duo
Higher and higher, we goin' up another kilo
Pressure from the climb, sittin' heavy like a sumo
Outer space melodies, every flavor jellybeans
Make me wiggle, make me giggle, sea anemones
Peace out, stratosphere, lickety-split, I'm outta here
Space, shippin', gravity, slippin'

My mind is blown with every single thing you do
Lose all control like I'm walking on the moon
You got me sprung and I'm trippin' over you
Baby boy, your love got me walking on the moon
The moon, the moon, the moon, yeah (Yup)
You might also like
You got me stumblin' like a love-drunk alien, DJ, play our song again
Take me a sobriety test and I'mma fail again
Blurry is my eyesight, stumble on my walk like
You and me can make our own constellation tonight
Just made sense, now I'm on another level
Please don't burn me up fast like the devil
I'm in first place, maybe I should get a medal
Never been this high up, foot on the pedal
Outer space melodies, every flavor jellybeans
Make me wiggle, make me giggle, sea anemones
Peace out, stratosphere, lickety-split, I'm outta here
Space, shippin', gravity, slippin'

My mind is blown with every single thing you do
Lose all control like I'm walking on the moon
You got me sprung and I'm trippin' over you
Baby boy, your love got me walking on the moon
The moon, the moon, the moon, yeah

Everything about you takes me high
Yeah, to the moon just like a satellite, oh
Never known a love like this before
I'm a million miles up off the floor, oh, oh, oh
My mind is blown with every single thing you do
Lose all control like I'm walking on the moon
You got me sprung and I'm trippin' over you
Baby boy, your love got me walking on the moon
My mind is blown with every single thing you do
Lose all control like I'm walking on the moon
You got me sprung and I'm trippin' over you
Baby boy, your love got me walking on the moon
The moon, the moon, the moon, yeah
