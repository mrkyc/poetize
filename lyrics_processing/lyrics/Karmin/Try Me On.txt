If you wanna try me on
Don't think we're together
I change like the weather
If you wanna try me on
Stop the conversating
Don't you keep me waiting

I admit it, you did it
You got me feeling something kinda vicious, delicious
But boy, I promise I won't do your dishes
Honey, write that down; oh, now, take a picture
You see me now? Independent bitch
I be coming at you like a raging bull
You better be gunning like a cannon full
I don't wanna hear you say a thing at all
Unless you're saying, "Baby, do you want some more?"

Hold up, girl, I like the way you talk
We can do it like you want
We can do it like you want

If you wanna try me on
Don't think we're together
I change like the weather
If you wanna try me on
I wouldn't admit it
Even if we fitted
Oh, you got my attention
If you wanna try me on
Stop the conversating
Don't you keep me waiting
You might also like
I'm the sickest, malicious
I tear you up in pieces
Make you wishes you didn't fall so deep in love the very second
That I let you taste my sugar coated waist
You gon' be saying "Hey, I want some cavities"
I be comin' at you like a raging bull
You better be gunning with a cannon full
I don't wanna hear you say a thing at all
Unless you're saying, "Baby, do you want some more?"

Hold up, girl
I like the way you talk
We can do it like you want
We can do it like you want

If you wanna try me on
Don't think we're together
I change like the weather
If you wanna try me on
I wouldn't admit it
Even if we fitted
Oh you got my attention
If you wanna try me on
Stop the conversating
Don't you keep me waiting
If you wanna try me on
You better be careful, baby
If you get to carry on
You could fall in love, l-l-l-love, love
If you wanna try me on
You better be careful, baby
If you get to carry on
You could fall in love, l-l-l-love, love

If you wanna try me on
Don't think we're together
I change like the weather
If you wanna try me on
I wouldn't admit it
Even if we fitted
Oh, you got my attention
If you wanna try me on
Stop the conversating
Don't you keep me waiting

Don't you keep me waiting
Don't you keep me waiting
If you wanna try me on
