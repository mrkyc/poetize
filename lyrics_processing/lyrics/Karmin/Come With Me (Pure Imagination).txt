I know a place that I can go
And nowadays I call it home
Some argue that it's make-believe
Oh, if only their eyes could see
That the forest is full of evergreens
And that none of the stars are out of reach
They can shoot us across the canopy
Make your wishes and count to three
(One, two, three)

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
What we'll see will defy explanation
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there we'll be free if we truly wish to be

I know a world within myself
Where I don't need nobody's help
All of the flowers start to sing
And heal everything that's ailing me
I can do anything without a doubt
Paint the colors the world would never allow
Letting go is the only currency
Make your wishes and count to three
(One, two, three)

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
What we'll see will defy explanation
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there we'll be free if we truly wish to be
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
What we'll see will defy explanation (explanation)
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there we'll be free if we truly wish to be

If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world, there's nothing to it
There's nothing to it!
There's nothing to it...!

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
What we'll see will defy explanation (explanation)
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there we'll be free if we truly wish to be
Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
What we'll see will defy explanation (explanation)
There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
