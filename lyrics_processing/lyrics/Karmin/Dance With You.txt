It only takes a ripple and it all comes down
But still the world is turnin', turnin'
Can I protect a candle so it won't blow out
When both the ends are burnin', burnin'

I know what I want
What I want is you
Why don't you give me a reason to act like a fool?
What else can I do?

We all gotta go sometime
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't know when, I don't know why
But tonight, I wanna dance with you
We all gotta go sometime
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't know when, I don't know why
But tonight I wanna dance with you
Oh, I wanna dance with you
Oh, I wanna dance with you
You might also like
And how can I pretend that I don't have a clue
That none of us will make it, make it, yeah?
If all we had was minutes, this is what we'd do
We'd step until they take us, take us

I know what I want
What I want is you
What else can I-

We all gotta go sometime
I don't wanna say goodbye
No, I don't know when, I don't know why
But tonight, I wanna dance with you
We all gotta go sometime
I don't wanna say goodbye
No, I don't know when, I don't know why
But tonight, I wanna dance with you

Oh, I wanna ride with you
Yeah, I wanna rock with you
I wanna dance with you
So what's the difference if we fall, fa-ah-ah-all, fa-ah-ah-all?
Let's move like nobody can watch, wa-ah-ah-atch, wa-ah-ah-atch

We all gotta go sometime
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't know when, I don't know why
But tonight, I wanna dance with you
We all gotta go sometime
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't know when, I don't know why
I don't know when, I don't know where
I don't know when, I don't know why
I don't know when, I don't know how
I don't know when, I don't know where
But tonight, I wanna dance with you
I don't know when, I don't know why
I don't know when, I don't know how
I don't know when, I don't know where
But tonight, I wanna dance with you
Oh, I wanna dance with you
Oh, I wanna dance with you, I do
Look, look at me while I wanna dance with you

I don't know when, I don't know why
I don't know when, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know when
