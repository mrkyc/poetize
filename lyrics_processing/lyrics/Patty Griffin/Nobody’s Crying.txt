He's off to slay some demon dragonfly
And he looks at me that long last time
Turns away again and I waved goodbye
In an envelope inside his coat
Is a chain I wore around my throat
Along with a note I wrote
Said I love you but I don't even know why
But, darling, I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell
How hard you're trying
I just have this secret hope
Sometimes all we do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
There's an endless rope
And nobody's crying
Well, the long night turns into a couple of long years
Of me walking around and round this trail of tears
Where the very loud voices of my own fear
A ringing and ringing in my ear

Every move I make is all wrong
Says you never gave a damn for me
For anything, for anyone
But, darling, I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell
How hard you're trying
I just have this secret hope
Sometimes all we do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
There's an endless rope
And nobody's crying
May you dream you are dreaming in a warm soft bed
And may the voices inside you that fill you with dread
Make the sounds of thousands of angels instead
Tonight where you might be laying your head
I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell
How hard you're trying
I just have this secret hope
Sometimes all I do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
There's an endless rope
And nobody's crying
Nobody's crying
