That never cared much for you anyway
And the different coloured doorways
You thought would let you in one day
Goodbye to the old bus stop
Frozen and waiting
The Weekend Edition
Has this town way overrated
You walk across the baseball green
The grass has turned to straw
A flock of birds tries to fly
Away from where you are
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, old friend
I can't make you stay
I can't spend another ten years
Wishing you would anyway
How the sky turns to fire
Against a telephone wire
And even I'm getting tired
Of useless desires
Every day I take a bitter pill
It gets me on my way
For the little aches and pains
The ones I have from day to day
To help me think a little less
About the things I miss
To help me not to wonder how
I ended up like this

And ride a rusty train
With a million other faces
I shoot through the city veins
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, old friend
You wanted to be free
Somewhere beyond the bitter end
Is where I want to be
How the sky turns to fire
Against a telephone wire
And even I'm getting tired
Of useless desires
Say goodbye to the old building
That never tried to know your name
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, old friend
You won't be seeing me again
Goodbye to all the windowpanes
Shining in the sun
Like diamonds on a winter day
Goodbye, goodbye to everyone
How the sky turns to fire
Against a telephone wire
It burns the last of the day down
And I'm the last one hanging around
Waiting on a train track
And the train never comes back
And even I'm getting tired
