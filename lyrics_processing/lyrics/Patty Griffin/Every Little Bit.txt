Disguised and disfigured
And you thought I tasted like rain
There`s nothing here but a shadow, nothing here
Now you know, now you know
Now you know, now you know
There's nothing here but the shadow
And now you know

I spit, I spit in the eye
I tear, I tear out my heart
And I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I'm sold by a lie
By this I am able in all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I clearly recall
Every little bit
I can chew like a cannibal
I can yell like a cat
I even had you believing that
I really really like it like that
But there was never a moment
Not a moment
Now you know, now you know
Now you know, now you know
You ever got within a hundred million miles of my soul

I tear, I tear out my heart
And I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I'm sold by a lie
By this I am able in all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I, I clearly recall
Every little bit
Every little bit (every little bit, every little bit, every little bit)
Every little bit
You left open the window till the morning
And the winter walked in
Reality fired her wooden bullet
Splintered under our skin
They say I'm walking on freedom
This is freedom
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
I still don't blame you for leaving baby
It's cold living with ghosts
I spit, I spit in the eye
I tear, I tear out my heart
And I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I'm sold by a lie
By this I am able in all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I, I clearly recall
Every little bit
Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit
