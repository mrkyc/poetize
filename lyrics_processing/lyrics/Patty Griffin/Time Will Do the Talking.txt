You were so cruel and I hated being your fool, so I got a little bit more mud on my face

I don't believe there is such a thing as saying too much
Oh, no
There are those who like to look and those who ain't afraid to touch
Oh, baby, don't you know that

Time will do the talking, years will do the walking
I'll just find a comfy spot and I'll wait it out
Oh, the time will do the talking, years will do the walking
Time will tell you, baby, what you can't hear now

Well, we dig our heels in and wonder who's gonna win this
Who is gonna win it or wear it out?
I change the locks on the door, I learn how to take a little more
I can outrun all of the devils here, but never the doubts, no, no
Try not to throw all your money into 20/20 vision, oh, no
No, the world won't wait on politics or indecision
Baby, don't you know that

Time will do the talking, years will do the walking
I'll just find a comfy spot and I'll wait it out
Yes, your time will do the talking, years will do the walking
Time will tell you, baby, what you can't hear now
