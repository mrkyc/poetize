So silent and peaceful in the darkness where we fell
But we are not snakes and what's more we never will be
And if we stay swimming here forever we will never be free
I heard them ringing the bells in heaven and hell
They got a secret they're getting ready to tell
It's falling from the sky, calling from the grave
Open your eyes, boy, I think we are saved
Open your eyes, boy, I think we are saved
Let's take a walk on the bridge right over this mess
Don't need to tell me a thing, baby, we're already confessed
And I raised my voice to the air and we were blessed
It's hard to give, it's hard to get
But everybody needs a little forgiveness
We are calling for help tonight on this thin phone line
As usual we're having ourselves one hell of a time
And the planes keep flying right over our heads
No matter how loud we shout hey, hey, hey
And we keep waving and waving our arms in the air but we're all tired out
I heard somebody saying today's the day
A big old hurricane, she is blowing our way
Knocking over the buildings, killing all the lights
Open your eyes, boy, we made it through the night
Open your eyes, boy, we made it through the night

And I raised my voice to the air and we were blessed
It's hard to give, it's hard to get
It's hard to live it, but still I think it's the best best
Hard to give, I'm never gonna forget
But everybody needs a little forgiveness
