I've never seen her this mad before
She took all her favourite things down from the window
And broke them all over her clean floor
It's Saturday at the mansion
The oldest boy walks with a slouch
The young ones are wild in back of the house
And she gave up and went back to sleep on the couch
Something as simple as boys and girls
Gets tossed all around and lost in the world
Something as hard as a prayer on your back
Can wait a long time for an answer
When I was little I'd stare at her picture
And talk to the mother of God
I swear sometimes I'd see her lips move
Like she was trying to say something to me
When I was eighteen I moved to Florida
Like everyone sick of the cold does
And I waited on old people waiting to die
Oh I waited on them until I was
Something as simple as boys and girls
Gets tossed all around and lost in the world
Something as hard as a prayer on your back
Can wait a long time for an answer

Gets tossed all around and lost in the world
Something as hard as a prayer on your back
Can wait a long time for an answer
Can wait a long time for an answer
Maybe it's all right
Maybe we won't fight any more
Maybe love is waiting at the end of every road
I don't know
I don't know
But maybe
