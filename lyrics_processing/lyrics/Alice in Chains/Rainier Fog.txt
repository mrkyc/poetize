Some things last
Sometimes, you never get over
Live in the past
You find out it's hard to stay sober
My see-through skin
Like urethane
Lost and then found
On view for all, and I wouldn't trade

You'd never know
A long time ago, you were frowning
Thinkin' it over
It's raining down, and somehow, you know

It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog

Some people change
Sometimes, you leave how it oughta be
Find a new way to come clean
Let it wash over me
My see-through heart
Of urethane
Beats for you proud
Up, down, and through all the love and pain
You might also like
You'd never know
A long time ago, you were crowning
Thinkin' it over
It's raining down, and somehow, you know

It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog

Left me here so all alone
Only for me to find
Hear your voice on waves we rode
Echoes inside my mind
Disembodied, just a trace
Of what it was like then
With you here, we shared a space
That's always half empty

Grinding, grinding on
Always half empty
Grinding, grinding on
Always half empty, yeah
So, we can laugh, it's inside
Never hear me complain
My see-through city
Of cellophane

You'd never know
A long time ago, you were drowning
Thinking it over
It's raining down, and somehow, you know

It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog
Remind me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
