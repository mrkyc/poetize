No more time
Just one more time

So crazy, beat the strain
Too lazy, shake the gray
So, and she willed the rain
So let me be defamed
Your redundancy stains
Tired of infantile claims
Like puppets on a string
So untangle you from me

Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

No more time
Just one more time

Your redundancy stains
Tired of infantile claims
Like puppets on a string
So untangle you from me
So crazy, beat the strain
Too lazy, shake the gray
So, and she willed the rain
So let me be defamed
You might also like
Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

One day, my plane leaves
Some way, my head creeps
Someday, my way leads
Some way, my head creeps

No more time
Just one more time

Empty room sets the scene
Pick at me slow, pain fiend
Suck me through barbed screen
Anger becomes our queen
Tongue whipping forked black
How long until you crack?
Surprised and set back
Lackeys' loose talk for fact
Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again
Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

One day, my plane leaves
Some way, my head creeps
Someday, my way leads
Some way, my head creeps
Creeps

No more time
Just one more time

So crazy feel the hate
Yeah, I've got years to wait
I know it's not too late
Lending clean hands to fate
Rise from the dirt I'm in
Hide in another's skin
Stick black dress doll with pin
Your mouth takes on my grin
So crazy
So crazy
