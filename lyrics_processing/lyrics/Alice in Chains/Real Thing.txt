I messed around as a little boy
I grew up, made the blade my new toy
Friends said, "Boy, with what you screwin' around?"
I said, "Don't concern yourselves
And just give me another blast"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt
Take it away, don't want no more
Even if you say, "Just one more"
I won't leave you alone, ooh

I grew up, went into rehab
You know the doctors never did me no good
They said, "Son, you're gonna be a new man"
I said, "Thank you very much
And can I borrow fifty bucks?"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt
Take it away, don't want no more
Even if you say, "Just one more"
I won't leave you alone
