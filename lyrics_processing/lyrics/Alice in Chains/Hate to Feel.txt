Oh, yeah
What's gone wrong?
I can't see straight
Been too long
So full of hate

What the fuck will it take?
Drown myself in my wake
Another Shaggy DA
Now a dog, shake my leg
Plastic man, paper face
Candy heart, what a waste
Gotta change, set a date
Eat my cake, lick my plate

Stare at me with empty eyes
And point your words at me
Mirror on the wall will show you
What you're scared to see

I can see, yeah (Wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel (Wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see (Wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel (Wish I couldn't feel at all)

So climb walls
Thin my blood now
And I crawl
Back to bed now

What the hell? Gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New Orleans, gotta get
Pincushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance

All this time, I swore I'd never
Be like my old man
What the hey, it's time to face
Exactly what I am

I can see, yeah (Wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel (Wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see (Wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel (Wish I couldn't feel at all)

What the hell? Gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New Orleans, gotta get

Be like my old man
