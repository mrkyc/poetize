Who-lay-hey-hey
Who-lay-hey-hey
Who-lay-hey-hey
And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives (Our lives)
Our lives (Our lives)
Our lives
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight)
Tonight
'Cause tonight's the night, am I right?
Dance

Feels like a night for a party
My nature so naughty
There's a knock on the door, it's the neighbors
Quit cock-blocking
We're having a ho-down, are you hoes down?
Don't let me pull my hose out
'Cause it's big, long, pink, strong
And been known to dance, like, all night long
Grab my hand, play this song
DJ, save my life, come on
Leave your fear, back off the wall
Free of beat and pussy pop
And if you don't have a pussy
Pop a cock into a booty
Into a booty, yeah, yeah
You might also like
And we danced (Oh)
And we cried (Oh)
And we laughed (Oh-oh)
And had a really, really, really good time (Oh)
Take my hand (Oh), let's have a blast (Oh-oh)
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

I am not, I am not going to stand on the wall
I will dance, I will dance, I will break that ass off
And I see you in the corner, corner looking so small
Doing the robot like, "If I die tonight, at least I went hard"
I will not, I will not give a damn who watches me
I will live, I will live, liberate the fox in me
I will be the disco ball, freaking give my all
To whatever girl's booty I'm freaking on
I'm not skeeting, nah, it's just freaking hot
Alright, I skeeted

I will not be a mannequin (No), the ego, banish it
The roof's on fire, let's burn down the Vatican
I will moonwalk to Pluto in honor of Michael Jackson
In heaven he'll be saying, "That man is tight at dancing"
RIP to the king, Michael Jackson, we learned it all from you
Dedicate this to the dance floor
Party up the sorrow 'til tomorrow morning happens
We pledge allegiance to the DJ, put your hands up
And we danced (Oh)
And we cried (Oh)
And we laughed (Oh-oh)
And had a really, really, really good time (Oh)
Take my hand (Oh), let's have a blast (Oh-oh)
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

You see me looking at you from that bar right over there
But your friends are huddled up and they are hating on a player
I just wanna dance with you, get on the back of you
Tip-tap the boots, extract the truth
Da-dance with you, get on the back of you
Da-dance, dance, dance, awesome

Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh (Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh)
Hey-oh, hey-oh (Hey-oh, hey-oh)
Uh-ah-ba-bo (Uh-ah-ba-bo)
Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop (Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop)

(Go, go, go, go, go, go, get on it)
Ladies, I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you, come here
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, get on it)
Alright, I see you, girl
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
And we danced
And we cried (Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh)
And we laughed
And had a really, really, really good time (Hey-oh, hey-oh)
Take my hand (Uh-ah-ba-bo), let's have a blast
