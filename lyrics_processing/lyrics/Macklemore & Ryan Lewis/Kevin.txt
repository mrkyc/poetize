Okay, okay
Yeah
And we live tonight
Check it, now

I seen pain, I felt the losses
Attended funerals and seen coffins
Twenty-one-years-old, an angel was lost here
Wings clipped by the grip of eighty milligram sniffs
Of OxyContin every day through the nostrils
Never went away, never does it stop there
Death a line or two away and a couple tall cans
'Cause you never know when God is gonna call, man
Precious, what we all share
I said peace at 5:30, the next time that I saw 'im
Was in the hands of the pallbearer
What if I would've never gone and dropped him off there?
Blaming myself, in hysterics, screaming "It's not fair!" Twenty-one-years-old
With a book of rhymes, he was gonna recite to the globe
Only thing to numb the pain besides that shit in his nose
He was gonna quit tomorrow, we're all gonna quit tomorrow
Just get us through the weekend, and then Monday follows
Then it's Wednesday, then it's "fuck it, I'm already feeling hollow"
Might as well go crack a seal and might as well go chug a bottle
Might as well go pop a pill and go and band-aid that problem
And escape this world, vacate this world
'Cause I hate myself, no praying's gonna cure
This pain

Doctor, please
Give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're in the waiting room
And something ain't right
Doctor, please
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
All this is on you
We're over-prescribed

For me and Kev
You end up in jail, institutions or dead
And with our lives, we play Russian Roulette
And try to find a life where we could be content
'Cause for us, we're just trying to minimize
The fear of being alive
And now my little brother is in the sky
From a pill that a doctor prescribed
That a drug-dealing billion dollar industry supplied
That the cops never go and profile at night
Yeah, the, the, the orange plastic with the white top they sell to you
Has us looking for the answers and that instead of you
Quick fix, whatever'll do, we just gon' neglect the truth
Because a doctor with a license played God and said it's cool
Played God and said it's cool
But me? I don't blame Kev
Or his mom freebasing while pregnant with him
I blame the pharmacy companies and country that spends
Trillions fighting a war they supplying themselves
Politicians and business and jail
Public defenders and judges who fail
Look at Kevin, look at Kevin, now he's wrapped in plastic
First dealer was his mom's medicine cabinet
Got anxiety, better go and give him a Xanax
Focus, give him Adderall, sleep, give him Ambien
'Til he's walking 'round the city looking like a mannequin
Ups and downs shifted by prescriptions you're handin' him
So America, is it really worth it? I'm asking ya
Doctor, please
Give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're in the waiting room (Woah, woah, hey, hey)
And something ain't right (Woah, woah, hey, hey)
Woah, woah, hey, hey
All this is on you (Woah, woah, hey, hey)
We're over-prescribed

Doctor, your medicine
And your methods
Can't cure my disease
Without killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
Doctor, your medicine
And your methods
Can't cure my disease
Without killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
