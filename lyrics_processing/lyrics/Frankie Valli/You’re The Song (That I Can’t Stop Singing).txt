I can't stop these tears from falling down
They're falling from my eyes like rain
Making such a fool upon my pillow
Like a fool, I know I'll try again and I'll cry again

You're the song that I can't stop singing
I am the fire and you turn me on
Words of the music will last forever
'Melody's good but to get along
I need you (You, you) like a flower needs the rain
I need you back with me once again
To make it fine again

Time and time again I tell myself that I will not be fooled again
Then my cool infatuation for you lets me down
I'm like a child again
Foolish child again

You're the song that I can't stop singing
I am the fire and you turn me on
Words of the music will last forever
'Melody's good but to get along
I need you like a flower needs the rain
I need you back with me once again
To make it fine again

You're the song that I can't stop singing
I am the fire and you turn me on (You are the song)
You're the song that I can't stop singing (Baby, I'm the fire)
I am the fire and you turn me on (You are the song)
You're the song that I can't stop singing (Baby, I'm the fire)
I am the fire and you turn me on (You are the song)
You're the song that I can't stop singing (Baby, I'm the fire)
I am the fire and you turn me on (You are the song)
You're the song that I can't stop singing (Baby, I'm the fire)
I am the fire and you turn me on (You are the song)
You're the song that I can't stop singing (Baby, I'm the fire)
