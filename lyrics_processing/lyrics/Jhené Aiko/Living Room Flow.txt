I'm so, glad you, called right on time
You must have just read my mind
If we skipped the small talk
Want you now
But, I don't have to stay til mornin'
I don't have to, I don't have to pack no clothes
I am really not that lonely
We finished, we finished and I will go

It's whatever you want
I wanna please you most
Whatever, whatever turns you on, oh
Just let me know
You are so creative
The way that you're makin'
Love to me, you do me
Like no one's ever done it
That is why I want it all the time
I don't want your heart
Or your love
Just, do what you do to my body
I, just wanna - that is all I want
You might also like
If these walls could talk
They'd say, "Pick me up, and put me on'em"
This bed's way too soft
It's time to get off, but keep it goin'
Keep it comin', keep me cummin'
Make me want it, don't you want it? Do you love it?
How you want it? Where you want it? Where we goin'?
Oh, living room floor, ohhh

It's whatever you want
I wanna please you most
Whatever, whatever turns you on, oh
Just let me know
You are so creative
The way that you're makin'
Love to me, you do me
Like no one's ever done it
That is why I want it all the time
I don't want your heart
Or your love
Just, do what you do to my body
I, just wanna - that is all I want
It's whatever you want
I wanna please you most
Whatever, whatever turns you on, oh
Just let me know
You are so creative
The way that you're makin'
Love to me, you do me
Like no one's ever done it
That is why I want it all the time
I don't want your heart
Or your love
Just, do what you do to my body
I, just wanna - that is all I want
That is all I want
That is all I want
Not your love, not your heart
I just want you to start
And do what you do to my body
Do what you do to my body
I love what you do to my body
