Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine

Pretending I have the patience
Pretending there is enough time for waiting
Remembering when we kept it all basic
I wanna go back so bad I can taste it
What do I care for?
You are not there anymore
I was not careful
That is all your fault
You let me fall

Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
You might also like
Buried alive here inside a nightmare
Living a life where you're gone
There is no light here
It will be light-years until my mind's clear
I did it all for love
I did it all
I'd trade it all for you
I'd trade it all
But what do I care for?
What are you here for?
If you're not there when I call?
I was not careful
And that's all your fault
You let me fall

Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine

This ain't how it's supposed to be
You and me supposed to be
Remember when it be just me and you in your crib smoking tree
Like you took control of me
And you had a hold of me
Had me so gone, baby, yeah, you had me giving me all of me
Now it's all over, it's all done
Shoulda never told ya you're the one
I'll be all right, I will be just fine
I'll be okay once you get out my mind
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine

In my mine
In my mine
