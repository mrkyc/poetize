Go figure
You were the trigger
You brought me to an obstructed view
When you knew the picture was bigger
Who am I kiddin'?
Knew from the beginning
You'd ruin everything, you do it every time
You are my enemy, you are no friend of mine, muhfucker

You muhfuckin' right
You muhfuckin' right, I'm bitter
You muhfuckin' right, I'm triggered
You muhfuckin' right, I...

Wanna fuck you right now
I just turned the lights out now
And you know when the sun go down
That's when it would all go down
Been a minute, been a while
Ain't let nobody hit it since you hit it
I know you always know what to do wit' it
But ain't no me and you without you in it
Damn, I'm 'bout to burn this bitch down
I think I need to lie down
'Cause I'm not tryna wild out now
But right now
You might also like
Don't know what I'm capable of
Might fuck around and go crazy on cuz
Might fuck around, have to pay me in blood
This ain't the way that you want it
Might catch a case in this bitch
Don't let me catch you face-to-face in this bitch
Tryin' my hardest not to disrespect you
After what you did, man, what you expected?

Tryna let the time fly (Yeah)
Tryna let the time go by
Tryna let the time heal all
Tryna let the time kill all
Of our memories
All you meant to me
All that history
All that's history
I'll calm down eventually
Fall back eventually, please
Call me back eventually
Fall back into me, yeah
Maybe I'm overreacting
Baby, I don't know what happened
You know all of my bad habits
You know it's hard for me to control that shit, man
'Cause when I get mad, I get big mad
Should have never did that, get back
'Bout to feel the wrath of a menace
In my bag, in my feelings
I'm a bad lil' bitch, and uh...
I'm triggered, when I see your face
Triggered, when I hear your name
Triggered, I am not okay, uh
You need to stay out my way
Triggered, when I see your face
Triggered, when I hear your name
Triggered, I am not okay (Yeah)
You need to stay out of my way
You need to stay out of my way (Yeah)
You need to stay out of my way, yeah
