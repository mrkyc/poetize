Okay, so you just
Go around breaking hearts just to see what is inside
Go around stealing them, feeding them to your pride
Did you ever stop and think that I might really need that
To stay alive?
I'm starting to believe that you don't really see that
I had given you my life, oh yeah

But it's okay, I'm gonna find my way
But as for you, I don't know what to say
If you don't learn, you'll never know a good thing
You'll never know a good thing

You will never know, you will never know no good
(Never know a good thing)
You will never know, no
You will never know, you will never know no good
(Never know, never know)
You will never know, no
You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know, no
You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know

I wish your mother loved you like I could've
That way you would've known how to love a woman
Mr. Conditional Lover
I wish your father would've stayed
I wish he never promised things that never did come true

But its okay, you're bound to find a way
Cause it will all come back around one day
If you don't learn, you'll never know a good thing
You'll never know a good thing

You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know no
You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know no
You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know no
You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know

It's okay, you just
Don't know no better, you're better off being alone
Hope you find comfort in all of the lies that you told
You'll never get it, I get it, I'm here on my own
I'll be on my own
But it's okay, I'm going to find my way
But as for you, I cannot say the same
If you don't learn, you'll never know a good thing
You'll never know a good thing

You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know no
You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know no
You will never know, you will never know no good
You will never know no
You will never know, you will never know no good
