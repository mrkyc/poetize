Hennessy in my cup
He always told me slow up
But I never really gave a fuck
We haven't spoke in three years
I wish that he could be here
I'm tryna fight through these tears
But I'mma call him anyway and tell him
Chorus:
Fuck this shit, I'm missing you so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I said fuck this shit that I was on before
Like then I didn't know but now I'm for sure
Ohhhhh, oh
I'm just sayin' I'll do whatever
To get you back, yeah I'll do whatever
Tell me have I said that ever?
Without you here I cannot do better
Without you here I cannot do better (Ohhh)
And I just been sittin here going crazy
Been thinking about the baby that we almost had
Thought I moved on but I didn't
Like, who am I kidding?
Shit it's all been bad
He threw a party, yeah he threw a party
Remember Marvin when he threw a party
We went to his room and shit got retarted
Hate that I used no protection I'm sorry
You might also likeI need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
I think that something was slipped in my drink
I know you're thinking how dumb can I be
Shouldn't been there anyway, I'm ashamed
That night was my first time trying cocaine
After we split up, nothing's been the same
I've been caught up living in the fast lane
It's been two months and I'm scared cause I'm late
Emotions are mixed up
I am just a crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to be my savior
Could it be you?
I'm just sayin' I'll do, I'll do whatever
Without you here I cannot, I cannot do better
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It only gets better with you
And I am only better with you
It's true
Baby, I'll do whatever I gotta do
Whatever I gotta prove
I'll do it, I'll do it
I'll do it
Cause I been drinking, I been smoking
Way too much and way too often
And I need you, and I need you right now
