Yeah
One, two, check
Check, one, two

I know what it's like to lose, do you? Do you?
Have you ever loved someone, then lost that one?
You can't even call they phone
You can't even ask how they day was
Nothing in life's guaranteed, you'll see, uh
I'm not being difficult, I just see things differently
When I say I wanna see you, that means something deeper to me

I've been missing you for ten thousand hours (Thousand hours)
I cannot let go, ten thousand memories (Memories)
I've been missing you for ten thousand hours (Thousand hours), yeah
I cannot let go, ten thousand memories (Memories)

Have you ever loved someone, then lost that one?
Have you ever missed someone that ain't coming back? Uh
You can't even tell that one 'cause they're not here to hear it
Do you hear me?
Nothing in life's guaranteed, you'll see
I'm not being difficult, I just see things differently
You don't see the urgency (You don't see the urgency)
That really worries me (That really worries me)
The problem is that we think, naturally, we have time but you'll find
Anything can happen, don't take it for granted
You know
You might also like
I've been missing you for ten thousand hours (Ten thousand hours)
I cannot let go, ten thousand memories (Ten thousand memories)
I've been missing you for ten thousand hours (Ten thousand hours), uh
I cannot let go (No), ten thousand memories (Ten thousand memories, yo)

Thinkin' back on some good times we had with some bad people, like
"I shoulda saw she was see through" or "He was evil", like
"I wasted my good experience with these people", like
"Guess it was meant to be, you was teaching me life"
So only half that memory's worthwhile
We had beef but at least there's a birth of a child
Cooled and flipped it, reminiscing bad times with good people's terrific
Beautifully different 'cause we still kick it
You said we can't be intimate, you said we can't go there
If this thing is going nowhere, it's so weird
Now it's cold, thought I had control, thought I took your soul
Nah, I took your mind, engraved my name
You told me that my mind is your favorite place to hang
Ten thousand hours turned to ten thousand bridal flowers
What was mine is ours
How many soulmates we get in this lifetime?
Right now's the right time, you the wife kind

You could search your whole life tryna find
A love as good as the time we had, we had (We had)
Every person that comes in your life
Here for a limited time
So be fair, be there (Be there), uh
Always planning, never manifesting
Father, please help me send him this message
Always planning, never manifesting
