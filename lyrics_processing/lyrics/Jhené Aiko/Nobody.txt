Attention is expensive to pay
I can't get by on minimum wage
Been dealing with this venomous rage
Since I was under the age
I've been under the influence of pain

And I never needed nobody
Never needed no one
No, I don't need nobody, nobody, nobody
I don't need no one, shit, I don't need no one

Fucking up my chakras again
My father is a doctor, I've been talking to him
All the shit I'm taking could've got it from him
I don't have no patience, prolly got it from him
Just a product of him
Pop one, pop two, pop three, four pills
These things tell me how life should feel
Fuck yeah, fuck you, it's my free will
Please don't tell me to chill

'Cause I don't need nobody
I don't need no one, I don't need no one
No, I don't need nobody, nobody, nobody
I don't need no one, I don't need no one

No one ever listened, no one called me pretty
Grampy called me Penny, I think I am worthless
I don't have a purpose
Who am I enough for?
Why we always lose what we work for?
Why we hurt more?
Why we never see my mother cry?
She's so tough for us, poor her

She don't need nobody, nobody, nobody
She don't need no one, she don't need no one
So I don't need nobody, nobody, nobody
I don't need no one, I don't need no one
I don't need

(Take this) grab my purse with my prescriptions in it
(Take this) tiny bursts of optimism in them
(Take this) I'm reversing my decision to win
(Take this) take this, take this, take
(Take this) back to '88 when everything was great
Then life had just begun
(Take this) it is '89 now, everything is fine now
I am only one
(Take this) wait for the 2008 summer
I'ma be a mother, wow
(Take this) 2012 summer, it just got tougher
I don't have my brother now
Take this, take six, take pics, faces, famous
Face it, fake shit, pain is faithless
Yes, I am aware I am tripping
I'm here in this hell that I don't wanna live in
I smoke on my own, I drink on my own
I know it's wrong
To people I know, they just wanna know what's going on
I can't tell a soul, no, I can't tell no one
Don't need nothing from no one
No, I don't need nobody
But you're not alone, you got me
Look, I know what'll make you feel better
