Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day

Shadows grew so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night (Ooh)
Far away from the city

But don't, oh no, hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait, hey-eeh-yeah-yeah

Ooh, baby, I love your way, every day, yeah-eeh-yeah
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day, yeah-yeah
I wanna be with you night and day

The moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
Well, I can see them under the pine

But don't, woah no no, hesitate, la-di-dah
'Cause your love just won't wait
Hey-eeh-yeah-yeah!

I wanna be with you night and day
Woah, baby, oh baby, please!

Every day, yeah-eeh-yeah!
How I love, how I love ya-hah
(I love your way)
Oh, baby, please!

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
But don't, oh no no, hesitate, la-di-dah!
'Cause your love just won't wait
Just won't wait

Ooh, baby, I love your way
Every, every day-eeh-yay!
I wanna tell you I love your way
I wanna tell you how I love your little ways
I wanna be with you night and day
Every day in every way, yeah!
