(Got to have it)
(A-ha, a-ha)
Baby, I need your lovin'
(I really need it)
Baby, I need your lovin'
(I really need it)
Although you're never near
(I really need it)
You're voice I often hear
(I really need it)
Another day, another night
(I really need it)
I long to hold you tight
(I really need it)
'Cause I'm so lonely
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your love
Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a woman to beg
Then weak I would rather be
If it means having you to keep
(I said I want ya)
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep

Ooh yeah!
When you see me, I smile and you know
Baby, gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed

This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, baby
Well it makes me feel half alive
