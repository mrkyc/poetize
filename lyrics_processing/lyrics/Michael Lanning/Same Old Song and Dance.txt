I've never had much luck regarding ladies
Don't understand them
I must confess
The Judys, Janes, Maryannes and Sadies
Add up to trouble in a dress

I start out optimistic
In matters of romance
But when I hear those violins
Then love's big game begins
The same old song
The same old dance
A dame will try and change you
A dame will bend your ear
A dame will turn you upside-down
Then run you out of town
You get the message loud and clear

She needs a sentimental, gentle, sensitive guy
Just look at her 
Someone who's caring, sharing, daring, handsome and strong
Who will admit that he's wrong
And guys like us don't stand a chance
It's the same old song and dance
You might also like
A dame will ask you questions
And then it's bombs away
Like, who's that girl you're looking at?
Does this make me look fat?
You lose no matter what you say
A dame will drive you batty
As crazy as a loon
The music in your heart goes 'round
That old familiar sound
Strike up the band and start the tune

She needs a sentimental, gentle, sensitive beat
To knock her right off her feet
Someone who's caring, sharing, daring, somebody who'll
Become her personal fool
And guys like us don't stand a chance
With that same old song and dance

Can't live with 'em
Or live without 'em
The thing about 'em is this
Don't forget every Mrs. once was a Ms

And sexy Suzies from France
All teach that same old song and dance
Why do I keep on falling?
Well, don't you think it's strange?
Why don't I walk right out that door?
And not come back for more?
That song and dance ain't gonna change

She needs the sentimental, gentle, sensitive kind
Somebody she'll never find
She want's a lovey, dovey, conversationalist
Guy doesn't exist
Still I would jump at one more chance
At that same old song and dance

Hey, ba-ba-boo
Smell that in a 
Hello romance
