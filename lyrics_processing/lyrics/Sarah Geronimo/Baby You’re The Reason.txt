When love ends, there is always a beginning
I've had my fair share of awakenings
But through the clouds, one day the sun came thru
It was the day that I found you

When hearts get broken and scars are left as token
It's just so typical to be cynical
But life does mend our hearts like new
I know now that I found you

Baby, you're the reason I smile again
I thank God for you
In a world that's full of possibilities
I see them all come true
Baby, you're the reason I live again
You make me feel so brand new
Baby, you're the reason

We met when we were both lonely and uncertain
Each coming from a place needing time and space
But then fate stepped in with a plan
Now two hearts beat as one
You might also like
Baby, you're the reason I smile again
I thank God for you
In a world that's full of possibilities
I see them all come true
Baby, you're the reason I live again
You make me feel so brand new
Baby, you're the reason

In the still of the night, I close my eyes
As you hold me so tight, our love just feels so right
Here in your arms, I feel (True love is real)
Don't ever let me go (Your love makes me glow)
Baby I want you to know that I love you so

Baby, you're the reason I smile again
I thank God for you
In a world that's full of possibilities
I see them all come true
Baby, you're the reason I live again
You make me feel so brand new
Baby, you're the reason
In a world that's full of possibilities
I see them all come true
Baby, you're the reason I live again
You make me feel so brand new
Baby, you're the reason (Baby, you're the reason)
