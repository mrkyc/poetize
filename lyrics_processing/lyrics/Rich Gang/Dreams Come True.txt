Then turn a pussy rat into my cute puppet
No ventriloquist, I make it talk to me, ayy (Hi!)
I'm the richest nigga in my hood (True)
Ten chains on me, smoking Cali' good
Private plane, luggage never necessary (Nah)

That super fly shit is mandatory
Chasing all this money, I just can't avoid it
Jesus pieces only keeping me anointed (Ugh)
Getting richer, niggas highly disappointed
