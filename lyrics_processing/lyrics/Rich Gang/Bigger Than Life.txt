When you winnin' to the fans, it ain't hard to decide
She know we fly, she pick a flight in no time
I'll be by my own business, why you busy mindin' mine?
You was on my level, we both came from the ghetto
And later we're separated, we hate it, I'm glad you made it
When your mountain top, they say there's nowhere to go but down
But I'll be chillin', just look around
Perpendicular, mama be straight forever
Her crib about a hour, now she a out-of-towner
Predicted it be better, we change the game like quarters
Two dimes together, they high five until whatever
I can mention your name, but I'd rather keep it clever

No stressin' no pressure, I'll bless you (Bigger than life)

Dreads in the wind, blowin' like a ribbon
Gettin' money like a bitch, um, Robin Givens

I'm definitely alive, bullshit aside
Red flag in my pocket, I caught a bullseye
