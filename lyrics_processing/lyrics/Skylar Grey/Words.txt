Always in a rush
Never stay on the phone long enough
Why am I so self-important?
Said I'd see you soon
But that was, oh, maybe a year ago
Didn't know time was of the essence

So many questions, but I'm talking to myself
I know that you can't hear me anymore, not anymore
So much to tell you and most of all goodbye
But I know that you can't hear me anymore

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, I never said
I can't take back the words I never said

Always talking shit
Took your advice and did the opposite
Just being young and stupid
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
I haven't been all that you could've hoped for
But if you'd held on a little longer
You'd have had more reasons to be proud
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
You might also like
So many questions, but I'm talking to myself
I know that you can't hear me anymore, not anymore
So much to tell you and most of all goodbye
But I know that you can't hear me anymore

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words

The longer I stand here, the louder the silence
I know that you're gone but sometimes I swear that I hear
Your voice when the wind blows, so I talk to the shadows
Hoping you might be listening 'cause I want you to know

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, I never said
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
