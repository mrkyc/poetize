Marry into this family and obtain a bunch of outlaws
Even the children drawin' guns out a little crayon box
Playin' with scissors, cuttin' straight to the point
No need to beat around the bush, we takin' shots to the groin

I take what I want
Take what I need
And do it all with dignity
Say what I want
Say what I mean
And I don't need you to agree, yeah

I don't spit before I fuck it
Got a hand on the pistol in my pocket
I don't play nice, I'm not a shit talker
I'm a straight shooter, now just give me the money, honey
Straight shooter, now just give me the money, honey
Straight shooter, now just give me the money
Got a hand on the pistol in my pocket
I'm a straight shooter, now just give me the money, honey

I ain't kissin' no ass, but I'm makin' out like a bandit
I'm brutally honest when I'm mouthin' off, here's a bandage
They say I'm savvy for my age and savage as any devil
But at least I'm no imposter strapped in Jesus sandals

And I don't need you to agree, yeah

I don't spit before I fuck it
Got a hand on the pistol in my pocket
I don't play nice, I'm not a shit talker
I'm a straight shooter, now just give me the money, honey
Straight shooter, now just give me the money, honey
Straight shooter, now just give me the money
Got a hand on the pistol in my pocket
I'm a straight shooter, now just give me the money, honey

Beware the beauty with the lonely face
Who whispers every word you want to hear
Evil is eager underneath her grace
And poison are the flowers in her hair

I don't spit before I fuck it
Got a hand on the pistol in my pocket
I don't play nice, I'm not a shit talker
I'm a straight shooter, now just give me the money, honey
Straight shooter, now just give me the money, honey
Straight shooter, now just give me the money
Got a hand on the pistol in my pocket
