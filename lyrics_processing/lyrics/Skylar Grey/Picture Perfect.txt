Picture perfect love
Suddenly upside down
Picture perfect love, oh
Suddenly upside down
Wipe the tears from your face and get high

Havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away
Havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away
You want me gone
Why can't you kill me yourself?
Just havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away

Picture perfect love
Suddenly upside down

Havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away
Havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away
You want me gone
Why can't you kill me yourself?
Just havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away
You might also like
The dream turned worse than a nightmare
Hear that sound?
Our demons cursin' and screamin'
Even when the sun is out
Pictures on the wall turned over
Like a home turned into a fun house
I'm stumblin' down the corridor
Like someone spiked my corona
Call the coroner
Our love is dead
And it's lying in the corner
Arms and legs stretched out on the floor like a Dali, Salvador
Its surreal nothin' feels real no more
All I can do is drink and smoke till I can't feel a fuckin' thing no more
Your face is startin' to change shapes
Into someone I've never seen before
I've been going insane since you been gone
Picture perfect never looked so wrong
And in the end if I can't make you mine
Ima drink myself into a new frame of mind

Havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away
Havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away
You want me gone
Why can't you kill me yourself?
Just havin' a bottle under the moonlight
Fadin' away
Wipe the tears from your face and get high
(Wipe the tears from your face and get high)
(Wipe the tears from your face and get high)
