You may think I'm harmless
You could not be more wrong
Careful what you do
I am just a ticking time bomb
You may think I'm laughing
You couldn't be more stupid
I'm laughing 'cause I know
That someday this ticking bomb will explode

If I said what I've been thinking
They would lock me up for good
I know you just won't understand me
Like the unabomber would

It appears to you I'm so together
But my plans are so much bigger than this

You may think I'm harmless
You could not be more wrong
Careful what you do
I am just a ticking time bomb
You may think I'm laughing
You couldn't be more stupid
I'm laughing 'cause I know
That someday this ticking bomb will explode
You might also like
Every day, I see a new thing
That makes me wanna start a fight
But I just stack the ammunition
And let the pressure build inside

It appears to you I'm so together
But my plans are so much bigger than this

You may think I'm harmless
You could not be more wrong
Careful what you do
I am just a ticking time bomb
You may think I'm laughing
You couldn't be more stupid
I'm laughing 'cause I know
That someday this ticking bomb will explode

Explode, explode, exploding
Explode, explode, exploding

I kiss so soft and sweetly
And you feel so safe bein' with me
But I try so hard to be happy
Boy, you make it look so easy
You may think I'm harmless
You could not be more wrong
Careful what you do
I am just a ticking time bomb
You may think I'm laughing
You couldn't be more stupid
I'm laughing 'cause I know
That someday this ticking bomb will explode

Explode, explode, exploding
