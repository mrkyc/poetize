Busted flat in Baton Rouge headin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all away to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With those windshield wipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sung up every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through every thing I've done
Every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Searchin' for the home I heard she formed
And I'd give all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine
You might also like
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothing but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
