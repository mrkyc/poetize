It's alright for some
But not alright for me
When the one that I'm lovin'
Slips around
You think it's fine to do
Things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me
Baby, can't you see
That I know how it is?

I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see the way you look
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes

And it's alright for some
But not alright for me
Where the one that I'm loving
Can't be found
The city where we live
Might be quite large
But the circle is small
Why not tell us all?
And then all of us will know
You might also like
I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking just like this
I can see the way you look
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes

It's alright to leave
But not alright to lie
When you come back
And you can't say where you've been
You think it's fine to do
Things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me
Baby, can't you see
That I know how it is?

I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see the way you look
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes
I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
