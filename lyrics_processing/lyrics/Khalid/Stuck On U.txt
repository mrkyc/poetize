So, this is gonna be one take!
One, two, three, four

I walk, I walk, I see the light
I push, I fall, and all of my life
I search for my love, I cannot find
A love like yours, as hard as I've tried
Lay by my side just for the night
This isn't love but it feels right
I must admit I cry at nights
I'm stuck on you and I don't know why

You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?

I don't know why I feel like this
At times I don't think I can handle it
I don't know why I feel so low
You were the one who kept me whole
You chew me up then spit me out
You stole the words right out my mouth
You fed me with "I love you"s
I don't know why I'm stuck
You might also like
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
