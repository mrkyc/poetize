It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side

All lights, all on you
City lights fall on you
Such a beautiful world
We're so high, I'm with you
Hypnotized, I'm with you
Such a beautiful world

It's like I'm livin' my dream out, dream out, yeah
Feels like we're on LSD, all day out, yeah

It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side
You might also like
Leave it all in our rearview as we pass the finish line
It's just us, yeah, it's you and I racin' under the green light
Feel the rush intensify, lately I feel so alive
Such a beautiful world, oh

It's like I'm living my dream out, dream out, yeah
Feels like we're on LSD, all day out, yeah

It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time (Time)
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline? (Skyline)
It's only just a rebuild (Yeah), but I swear it feels real
When you-

When you, when you
Yeah
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
