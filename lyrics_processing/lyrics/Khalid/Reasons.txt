Evade my intellect
Feed into my introspect
Wrap your words around my brain
Driving me insane, yeah, ooh
You found the real me
Save my inner being
Switch on me like seasons
Do I need to give you a reason?

There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Reason)
Yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I know you're tired of inconsistency
Are you into me? Are you feeling me?
To be honest
I'm into you, and the way that you talk is so damn cool
With your love I'm on a different high I've never felt before
And if your love is a drug, I'm an addict 'cause, damn, I'm feening for more, yeah
We've been talking for a minute now
Let me know where your head's at, am I in it? Yeah
You put me on your super high
I want to get lost in your paradise

Lucid dream, in reality
I'm just tryna feel your gravity
Always fallin' in love, and I'm tired of the cycle
We don't even need a title
You're always on my mind
It's funny how I'm thinking about you all the damn time
You don't got to be mine, just be mine for the night
I don't know what this is but it feels just right
I wanna make a move
Let me know if that sounds cool, yeah
All the things I'd do
All the things I'd do for you
