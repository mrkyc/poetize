Would you ride for me?
Lie for me?
Die for me?
Vibe with me?
I don't want this to end
But i'm not your man
So when this hits the fan would you?

I've got a girl on my way and she looks like Rihanna
Babygirl, I'm legit, I'd probably wife up your momma
Catch me rolling to the spot in my blacked out Honda
My main girl is foreign and she tastes like designer
Netflix and chillling so get out of your feelings
If you never do business, leave the building
I want a bad girl with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just leave the frustration in the past
1, 2, 3 to the 4
Counting down the time until our bodies hit the floor
Just a young dude, don't know why i'm feeling you
But i don't want a relation so
