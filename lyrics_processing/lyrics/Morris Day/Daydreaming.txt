You can't see me, but
I can see you
Relax, it's only me baby
Yeah, I'd turn around
Now I want you to lie back
And close those big, brown
(No) Just close your eyes
While I take you on a magic carpet ride
I'm back!

Picture this, a point of view
Another place and time
A paradise so real that you
Forget to close your eyes

Girl, only when you're with me

Dreamin' late into the night

It's only just a frame of mind

We could have a picnic in the sand
I could bring us some chicken and cheese
Some fruit, ah

We could, we could
