Love sign (Get up)
Love sign (Get up)
Pop, pop, pop go the pistol
Bang, bang, bang go the gun (Get up)

If you're sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and 4 ever more (2 signs of the times)
If you'd rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun (Time is passing, passing is time)
In a chariot of red and gold
The cool, fuzzy voice said "Come save your soul"
Before the fear of rejection reared its head
He stood before the masses and calmly said

In the day of where and why we all belong
Don't nobody want to hear a silly love song
And if they did then we would sing it on the news
While you're aiming your gun at me and I'm aiming back at you
