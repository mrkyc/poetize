I think you're beautiful and should be free
I'm just a young man got lots of time
Right now that kind of thing isn't on my mind
Don't wait for me
(I'll just make love to you girl)
Then set you free
I'm just a young man
What makes you think that I have the time oh oh
2 people falling in love in my prime
You think I'm afraid of how it would be
Might be too cautious girl don't blame me
Time after time again baby I tried
Don't take it personal girl
Still on your side no
Don't wait for me
(I'll just make love to you girl)
Then set you free
I'm just young man
What makes you think that I have the time oh oh
2 people fall in love in our prime
Break it down
