Elvis has left the building
Morris is in the house
Oh yeah you can stand up now
Give me that standing ovation
You know how I like it
Every time you see me
That's right baby look at me
Talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Oh would you like to go for a ride
I'm not gonna drive but ahh
Maybe we can get in the back of a limo or something
Let's go do some fun things
Let's go over to my house
Let's go over to your house
No I got a better idea
