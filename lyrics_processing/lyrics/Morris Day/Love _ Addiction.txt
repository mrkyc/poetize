I used to love her
Everybody said leave her alone
Breakin' up's so hard
Well it's a strange thing to go through
I'm kind of hooked on the way she turns me on

He's so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh sometimes you really don't know
So, so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh baby, sometimes the world's so cold
Is it really so bad to have found the perfect lover
Even if every now and then she's cold
Well, she's got a certain kind of feel
It's so true, she's like no other
She never leaves me hangin' very long

He's so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh sometimes you really don't know
So, so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh baby, sometimes the world's so cold

He's so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh sometimes you really don't know
So, so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh baby, sometimes the world's so cold
Don't mess with it, huh
In a world so cold
Band aid

He's so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh sometimes you really don't know
So, so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh baby, sometimes the world's so cold
Such an innocent crime
To be fooled, she made me need her
She'd do me right, sometimes she does me wrong
Yeah in the back of my mind
I know it's time, time to leave her
She'll look around and I'll be gone
He's so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh sometimes you really don't know
So, so blind to defeat
She brought the man to his knees
Oh baby, sometimes the world's so cold
Don't let her turn you out
You know what that girl's about
Don't let her lead you on
