Alright, y'all got 10 seconds to get to the dance floor
Whawk!
C'mon now...
America, have you heard? I got a brand new dance and it's called "The bird"
You don't need no finesse or no personality, you just need two arms and an attitude
And everybody sing with me, come on now!
Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa!
Brothers, don't be cool. Women like it sometimes when you act a fool
Sisters, don't be shy. Let your body get loose, you ain't too fat to fly
Come on now! Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa!
Yes! Hold on now, this dance ain't for everybody. Just the sexy people
White folks, you're much too tight
You gotta shake your head like the black folks. You might get some tonight
Look out!
America, have you heard? I got a brand new dance and it's called "The bird"
