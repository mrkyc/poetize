You learn to pick and choose
Though you love to play the game
You're so afraid to lose
And it takes a man
Just to understand a man's pride
It's a man's pride baby
It makes him laugh
It makes him cry
It's a man's pride that keeps a man alive
When you're young you make mistakes
That tend to leave you sad
As you grow you learn to take
The good things with the bad
Cause it takes a man
Just to understand a man's pride
As a man it all begins
You change your point of view
And it seems it never ends
The things you're going through
You see it takes a man
Just to understand a man's pride
It's a man's pride baby
It makes him laugh
It makes him cry
It's a man's pride that keeps a man alive
It's a man's pride baby
Something we all must learn to stand
Well it's a man's pride that makes a man a man
