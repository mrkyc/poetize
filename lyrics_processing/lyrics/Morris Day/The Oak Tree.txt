Morris, why are you having that tree cut down?
Because, it symbolizes something of great value to me
And I am going to have it put in my living room - do you mind?
Oh, what does it symbolize to you - Morris?
Baby, just relax a moment, and I will show you
(Not right now)

All in a line from the worst to the best
When it comes to cutting a rug
I'll put you to the test
Ain't nobody better
Is what they're telling me
"Say, Morris, what's that dance you're doing?"
Well I'm doing the Oak Tree haha

(Oak Tree!) I'll put you to the test
(Oak Tree!) When it comes to dancing I'm the best
(Oak Tree!) Ready to debut
(Oak Tree!) Spread your branches, you know what to do

Dancing like a tree
See my branches never rest
It may sound kind of silly, girl
But I do it with finesse
You see, I never do the boogaloo
Or the chicken that ain't me
But you can bet your bottom dollar, girl
I can do the Oak Tree, look out
