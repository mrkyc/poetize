This job I had one time as a talent scout, hmm
I had a hard day at the office and the boss wasn't in town
The day this hired legged guitar picker just happened to come around
Well, he walks in my office with a great big grin
And folks that's where my story really begins
He said, "Son my name is Boregard Rippy
I come to you from Tupelo Mississippi
I write songs that'll sing like a bird
I play licks on my guitar like you ain't never heard
But I'm down on my luck and things are just a little slack
I gotta quarter in my pocket and a shirt on my back
But you buy me some supper and give me a place I can sleep
He said "I'll sing you some songs that'll rock your head to sleep
I got talent boy. Said back home they call me the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
Well I knew I was in a room with some kind of a nut
When he pulled out that pack of used cigarette butts
So that's when I told him "We can't use you today"
So I handed the boy a dollar and sent him on his way
Well the boss got back and we both had a laugh
When I told him 'bout the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
And pretty soon I had the story circling around
About this Mississippi nut that we had in our town
You might also likeI said, "watch him everybody, the boy's squirrelly!
He walks around calling himself the Tupelo Mississippi Flash."
Well it happened one day while I was driving to my home
I just happened to have my car radio on
When I heard the jockey raving about a brand new smash
By a kid called the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
I almost wrecked my automobile
I went through a red light
I hit the traffic cop....Why??
Well my story's got an ending and it's short and sweet
The boss man he fired me and left me out in the street
But I got a new job now and I'm as learnin' real fast
I'm drivin' the bus for the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
And his Cadillac I'm driving that for him too
And that yacht he's got
And is there a plane??
Well chauffeur, chauffeur I hear him say
