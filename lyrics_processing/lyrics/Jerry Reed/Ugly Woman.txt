I ain't gonna drink no more tobacco I ain't gonna smoke no more moonshine
I'm through lookin' at good lookin' women ain't gonna bother now to waste my time
Ain't gonna drink no more black coffee thinkin' about her till the break of daylight
I'm gonna go out and find me an ugly woman to love

Son I'm a gonna put on my walkin' shoes
I'm gonna walk down the avenues
I'm gonna keep on walkin' till I find an ugly woman to love
I don't care if she's short don't care if she's fat
Just as long as she's good to me that's where it's at
I'm gonna find me an ugly woman to love son
