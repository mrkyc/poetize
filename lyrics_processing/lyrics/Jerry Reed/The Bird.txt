Well my throat was dry and it was a-gettin' late
And I was at this bar on an interstate
When a guy with this bird on his shoulder walked through the door, yeah
He proceeded to tell me the wildest thing
He said, "Sir, this bird of mine can sing like no other bird
You have ever heard before"
Well I kinda looked at the guy and said "Oh, really?"
He turned to the bird and said "Do ol' Willie"
When the bird started singing I almost fell in the floor

Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I got to take care of me

Well if that ain't the darnedest thing
Well I thought, son, what a heck of a thing
A man could get rich making that bird sing
And I could feel this wild idea comin' on strong
"And besides, I'm just sittin' here with two weeks pay
And I'd probably blow it all on beer anyway"
Then he said "Hey, wait till you hear him sing like George Jones"

He stopped loving her today
They place a wreath upon his door
Soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

I said, "Well that does it sir
Yep, I'd like to buy that bird would a-
Five hundred dollars take him off your hands, huh?"
Well, he thought for a while and he said, "Alright"
He handed me the bird and he said "Goodnight
Counted my money and out the door he ran
Well, I was thinkin' I'd found the rainbow's end
And the money would soon be pouring in
When suddenly the bird just flew out the door and was gone!
Well, then it hit me: I got boilin' mad
'Cause I knew right then that I'd been had
And as he flew out into the night he was signing this song

On the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again (Somebody stop that bird)
The life I love is making money with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again (My bird)
I just can't wait to get on the road again (My five hundred dollars)
The life I love is making money with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again (Somebody get me a BB gun)
On the road again (I want that bird)
I just can't wait to get on the road again (This is for the birds)
The life I love is making money with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again (Buy me a drink somebody)
