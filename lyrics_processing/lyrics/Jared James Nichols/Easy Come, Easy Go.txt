They say my love for you is in vain
Keep telling you, don't get fooled again
Ride along we're both right here, right now
Don't let this moment go, don't let me go

Moon high, dark sky
Can't keep the time on our side
Moon high, dark sky
One shot, we're getting it right

I still walk alone
Just like a rolling stone
Right know you should know
It's easy come and easy go
Can't change a thing for good
Guess I was born to run
Right now you should know
It's easy come and easy go

I miss your leather, miss your lace
I miss the sunrise on your pretty face
I tell no promises, I leave no lies
When the morning comes you'll still be on my mind

Can't change a thing for good
Guess I was born to run
Right now you should know
It's easy come and easy go, yeah
