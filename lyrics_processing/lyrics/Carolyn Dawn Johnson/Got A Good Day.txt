Ice cold gas station lemonade
Mmmm, just to cool me off
My girlfriend on the phone
Giving me the skinny on the brand new beau
I can always count on her to know what's going on
Tom Petty's singing me "Free Fallin"
I hear the summertime a-callin'
And I got the sunshine and the blue sky up above
I got the black-top under my wheels
And I got big dreams and I got people that I love
And there ain't nothin' wrong
I got a good day going on
Window's way down
Smellin' sweet honeysuckle all around
Mmmm, I just have to breathe it in
I look left, I look right
I look to see the scenery, it's outta sight
Oh, it just doesn't get better than this
No sense of time, no clear direction
Just gonna bask in this perfection
And I got the sunshine and the blue sky up above
I got the black-top under my wheels
And I got big dreams and I got people that I love
And there ain't nothin' wrong
I got a good day going on

I said hey, hey, are your hands up
If you're feeling the beat and you're having some fun
I said hey, hey, are your hands up
If you got a good day going on
I got the sunshine and the blue sky up above
I got the black-top under my wheels
And I got big dreams and I got people that I love
And there ain't nothin' wrong, oh no
I got a good day going on
(Got a good, got a good, got a good day)
(Got a good, got a good, got a good day)
(Got a good, got a good, got a good day)
(Got a good, got a good, got a good day)
I got a good day
I got a good day goin' on
Oh yeah
