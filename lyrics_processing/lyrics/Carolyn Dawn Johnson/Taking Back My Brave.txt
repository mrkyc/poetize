Where I learned to tough it out
WhereI kicked the dirt an' my dreams around
To conquer the whole world
My uncle slipped me fifty bucks:
Some rolled their eyes an' wished me luck
Yeah, I spent the first night in the cab of my truck
An' I am still that girl
I like a challenge an' I like to fly
I'm not always perfect; I'm not always right
When I go to weddings, it always makes me cry
My heart is fragile an' I can be hurt
An' I can crumble inside at the drop of a word
But I can jump off a limb into a river change:
I'm taking back my brave
I kinda lost it for a while
I had to force myself to smile
An' I quit going that extra mile.:
Abandoned my belief
An' I spent hours on the phone
Crawlin' back to my comfort zone
Then I woke up one day; said I'm not runnin' home:
It's just not like me

I'm not always perfect; I'm not always right
New born babies always makes me cry
My heart is fragile an' I can be hurt
An' I can crumble inside at the drop of a word
But I can jump off a limb into a river change:
I'm taking back my brave
I'm my Momma's only girl;
The child in a mess
(I've always been that way.)
I been pushin' the limits
Since I was little, yeah, yeah
Oh, my heart is fragile an' I can be hurt
An' I can crumble inside at the drop of a word
But I can jump off a limb into a river change:
I'm taking back my brave;
I'm taking back my brave, yeah
Takin' it back, back
I'm takin' it back, back
I'm taking back my brave, yeah
