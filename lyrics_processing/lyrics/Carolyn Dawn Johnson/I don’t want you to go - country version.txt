Here it is again sneaking up on us uh, uh, uh yeah
This is the part you know i don't like
We say goodbye and then we kiss goodnight uh, uh, uh yeah
I know it's one o'clock and we said you'd be gone by 10
So much for those 8 hours i swore that i'd get in
I know i should get some sleep
Another beginning of another long week
But i don't want you to go
No i dont want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cuz i don't want you to go
No i don't want you to go
We always say just one more kiss
But it always seems to never end like this uh, uh, uh yeah
A few dozen and a couple more
Before we know it its after 4, uh, uh, uh yeah, uh, uh, uh yeah
I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Cause here we go again watching the sun come up, yeah
I know i should get some sleep
I am at the beginning of another long week
But i don't want you to go
No i dont want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cuz i don't want you to go
No baby i don't want you to go...
I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Because here we go again
Watching the sun come up oh yeah
I know i should get some sleep
I am at the beginning of another long week
But i don't want you to go
No i dont want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cuz i don't want you to go
No baby i don't want you to go...
Yeah, i don't want to go
