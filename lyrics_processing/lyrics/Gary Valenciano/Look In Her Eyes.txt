With one look it was love knocking at my door
Someone like her I never thought I'd find
Every second she's on my mind
Oh I may be crazy I may be a fool
To believe that what she feels is the same way too
As she walks on by somehow I've got to try
Does she know she's got a hold on me
'Cause she's got that look
In her eyes when she smiles
I can't keep my mind from thinking about that girl
Look in her eyes when she smiles
She's got that look
Sometimes I wonder does she really know
What she does when she makes me feel this way
If this is love why must it be so cruel
All I ask is that she'd be mine
Oh I may be crazy I may be a fool
To believe that what she feels is the same way too
As she walks on by somehow I've got to try
And make her know she's got a hold on me yeah
Look in her eyes when she smiles
I can't keep my mind from thinking about that girl
Look in her eyes when she smiles
'Cause she's got that look
In her eyes when she smiles
Look in her eyes when she smiles
Wish she knew what she does to my heart
Everytime she turns and walks away
If I knew I would call out her name
But what can I say
There's this feeling I just can't explain
Look in her eyes when she smiles
I can't keep my mind
From thinking about that girl
Look in her eyes when she smiles
Look look yeah look I know it
Look she's got it right
Look yeah look look I know it
Look she's got that look
Wish she knew what she does to my heart
Everytime she turns and walks away
If I knew I would call out her name
But what can I say
There's this feeling I just can't explain
Look in her eyes when she smiles
I can't keep my mind
From thinking about that girl
Look in her eyes when she smiles
I just gotta take that look into her eyes
Look in her eyes when she smiles
Look in her eyes when she smiles
Look look in her look eyes
When she look smiles
Look in her look eyes
When she look smiles
Look in her eyes
Look when she smiles
Look in her eyes
