Sometimes I just don't know
What keeps me in your love
Why you never let me go
And though you're in me now
I fall and hurt you still
My Lord, please show me how
To know just how you feel
You have forgiven me
Too many times, it seems
I feel I'm not what you might call
A worthy Christian after all
And though I love you so
Temptation finds its way to me
(Chorus 1)
Teach me to trust in you with all of my heart
To lean not on my own understanding
I just forget
You won't give me what I can't bear
Take me out of the dark, my Lord
I don't wanna be there
Ooh ohh hoo...
You might also likeYou've never left my side
You gave your hand to me
To hold you, Oh Jesus
I'm no longer in the cold
And yet I leave you there
When I feel satisfied
I'd like to thank you everyday
Not only when I feel that way
I've never known a man who'd give his life
For sinners like me
And yet because he loves us so
He's promised us eternity
And we can have that promise and be His
If we have faith and just believe
(Chorus 2)
Teach us to trust in you with all of our heart
To lean not on our own understanding
'Cause we just forget
You won't give us what we can't bear
Take us out of the dark, my Lord
'Coz we don't want to be alone
Take us out of the dark, my Lord
We don't wanna be there
Yeah, my Lord
Trust in you with all of my heart
Lean not on my own understanding
'Cause I just forget
You won't give me what I can't bear
Take me out of the dark, my Lord
Cause we don't want to be alone
Take me out of the dark, my Lord
I don't wanna be there
