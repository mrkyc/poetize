This is the land of my birth; I say this is the land of my birth
I say this is jamaica, my jamaica, the land of my birth
I will never leave her shores, I will never run away
I will always believe in the black, the green, the gold I say
All nations greater of all the trials, we must face the test of time, that our people they are strong and we going to get along
For some people say we poor, but the progress you make my friend is not always how rich you are
I say this is the land of my birth; I say this is the land of my birth
I say this is jamaica, my jamaica, the land of my birth
Let us stop for a minute, count our blessings one by one
We should never be disloyal, but stand up and keep strong
My jamaica is a beautiful island, she is the crown of the caribbean sea and our people they are free, no oppression here to see
With the prettiest women there be. and the hills, and the plains and the rivers and the valleys always make on the beach
I say this is the land of my birth; I say this is the land of my birth
I say this is jamaica, my jamaica, the land of my birth
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, aah, aah, aah
Ms tourist, mr. tourist, leave your land and come
Tarry here for a while, and I will bathe in the warm warm sun
We will share a lot with you. our people they are true, they will want to be with you
They will love, they will help, they will give, if you wish my friend you can live
You will be a happier one in the land of the rising sun
