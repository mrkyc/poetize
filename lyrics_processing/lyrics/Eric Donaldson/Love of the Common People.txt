Living on free food ticket
Water in the milk
From the holes in the roof
When the rain came through
What can you do?
Oooh oooh oooh-ooh
Tears from your little sister
Crying 'cause
She doesn't have a dress
Without a patch or a party to go
What do you know?
She'll get by

For she's living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you twinkle-twinkle
Mommy's gonna love you
'Til as much as she can

It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the holes in your pocket
And you'd lose it
In the snow on the ground
You gotta walk into town to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the holes in your shoe
And the snow comes through
Boy, it chills you to the bone
I said, you'd better go home where you'll be warm
You might also like
And you will live
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you twinkle-twinkle
Mommy's gonna love you
'Til as much as she can

She caaan!
She caaan!
She caaa-aaaaa-aan!
She can!
She caaan!
She caaa-aaaaa-aan!

Living on dreams ain't easy
The closer the knits, the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You got to take them in strides, family pride
You know that, faith is your foundation
With a whole lot of love
And a warm conversation, man don't forget the place
I say, you better go home
You'll be strong
And you will live
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you twinkle-twinkle
Mommy's gonna love you just
'Til as much as she can

She caaan!
She caaan!
She caaa-aaaaa-aan!
She can!
She caaan!
