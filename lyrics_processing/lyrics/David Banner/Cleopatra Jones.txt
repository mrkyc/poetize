Cleopatra Jones
David Banner, you know you sexy as fuck
Whoop (Cleopatra Jones)

She said I'm like Malcolm, she Betty Shebazz
But still let me smack on that ass, yeah
Ain't ratchet a bit, but don't take no shit
From no cop or no thot, I don't fuck with no bricks (No bricks)
She don't fuck with no cats or no dogs
Unless they some lion and pits, I ain't lying a bit
If God made a mold, I'm thinking she it
And I'm trying not to think with my dick
But my dick think he Einstein
He got his own mind and he focused (Focused)
Her body does tricks, no hocus pocus
At times, tryna not to be bogus
I'm losing my focus, I'm thinking it's hopeless (Hopeless)
Splitting these verses like Moses (Like Moses)
She swarmed through them jeans like locusts (Locusts)
I know she a queen but I still wanna poke it

Cleopatra Jones ('Til I'm screaming out ooh)
Cleopatra Jones (Ooh)
Cleopatra Jones ('Til I'm fucking with you)
Cleopatra Jones (You)
Cleopatra Jones (She badass, she badass)
You might also like
She walk in this bitch with her hands on her hips
Her shoes at the bottom be banging like Crips
But on opposite shit, an opulent chick
(What's opulent?) Rich
She Sheba, she look like a diva, she move like a Davis
Don't play us, she spray us, she stay on some (Angela shit)
So imagine this shit and I wish I could lick on her brain (Brain)
And everything else on the frame (Mayne)
No average dame
I thought of her name and I came
I feel like a lame but my aim is to kill with this Dick
Gregory, every verse that I spit
Is all on the wave, don't fuck with no slaves
And she ain't abandoning ship, ain't abandoning shit
My Harriet Tubman, she dumping these clips
And slapping these hoes in the lips

Cleopatra Jones (Jones)
Slapping these hoes in the lips
