Ahem, tool on deck why would I lie?
You a, you got nine lives
I can hit a, with the .9, nine times
Country (country) boy, country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil' Weezyana
Errbody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a (I'm a) animal, syrup sippin' (sippin')
So high you couldn't reach me with a, antenna
You, with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The, gimme brains but the, add liver
The rapper is insane flowing like a mad river
Make your, quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho, hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her? Ha

Eleven letters on my back, Mississippi 'til I die
If I get a pen and pad, nine lyrics gon' fly
I'ma make the track cry, praising God in the sky
When nine preachers preaching nine sermons, telling nine lies
'Cause each and every one of ya'll nine rappers couldn't spit
I would have rather made a beat and got thick and grab quick
Invest a little let it flip, nine bars from my lips
Nine mil' in eighteen months, now that's a grip
I'ma suicide risk, nine slits on each wrist
If I die nine times the next go-around's a trip
And if I come back, I'm rockin' ninety-nine shows
In the front with all of my fans, throwin' elbows all day
We bustin' out of your speaker
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it (so you feel it)
Because of the law, I had to conceal it (to conceal it)
And if you mess around, you gon' make me reveal it, ay (ay)

I'm a West Coast original, black John Wayne
Where we from we like to pop that thang
Ay, you better stop that man
Fat mouth the dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang (bang)
Pigs wanna bust me (pigs wanna bust me)
Wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm, like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah, I'ma
I ain't here to lock up I flash the (flash the)
Then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter, Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
Always acting hard
I keep a, millimeter in my waist and got two more in the car
Yeah you all 'bout to get it, so quit it
Tryin' to conceal it
You, around and make me reveal it, so killas kill it
We bustin' out of your speaker
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it (so you feel it)
