215
I got the wordplay of Wallace, work ethic of Shakur
I was sent into the future with a message from the Moors
I went to war, my weapon just a blessing from the Lord
Rest assured that my pen is more mighty than a sword
I got plans, I'm taking my revenge like Roxanne
My man swam here from Mississippi, goddamn
Y'all fall for anything, that's the shit I cannot stand
We on that CMB, basically all we got fam
Y'all know my lineage is godliness and cleanliness
Otis used to sing how we should try a little tenderness
But they ultra envious, crazy disingenuous
Like, who need a enemy if that's what type of friend you is?
I pull off capers and Don Draper a skyscraper
Defy nature, leave 'em stuck like flypaper
Who ever said we not at the top of the totem
Was smoking Lamar Odom, you bring the bar lower
We pack 'em and bar code 'em, after it's all over
I capture the far nova, back to the Mars Rover
Then, let Sankofa supply me with the Gamma
I smash the vocal booth and turn back to David Banner, nigga

Who want it?
Everything that they can fuck with it
Ain't no exemptions, anybody, anybody get it
Anybody get it, yeah
Who want it?
Everything that they can fuck with it
Ain't no exemptions, anybody, anybody get it
Anybody get it, get it

FOX, CNN and white crooked police
Y'all can all eat a dick, see I tried king's peace
Kids dying in the streets, crack sold over beats
See religion is a leash, it's all slavery to me
Niggas to gods, gods to niggas, niggas I'm grown
Demons on the internet, they got eyes in your home
Eyes in your cellphone, eyes in your dollar bill
See they raped my grandmammy then they called it God's will
I'm the glitch in the matrix but you choose your own pill
Kneel to the Almighty
It's my second time asking what happened to Chris Lighty
Or Prince
I'm convinced that they they lie, then they tell us that it's drugs
Or suicide, then they sweep that shit under the rug
Fuck a plug, unless he has the key to get free
And a boat strong enough to drag a ship across the sea
See I shitted on the game, but I now I take a Master P
Aquaman with a contraband and all y'all are pets
Little bitches in the sea and alla y'all will get wet
It's the reign of the Tech, y'all fuckers get the Beatnuts
Yeah, I love the craft, but tonight, bitch, I beat guts
Encore, if I clap your scalp and your feet touch
Guns with your finger and a trigger don't mean much
Nigga, who want it?
Who want it?
Everything that they can fuck with it
Ain't no exemptions, anybody, anybody get it
Anybody get it, yeah
Who want it?
Everything that they can fuck with it
Ain't no exemptions, anybody, anybody get it
Anybody get it, get it

Anybody get it
Everybody get it, get it
Anybody get it
Everybody get it (Anybody get it, whoa, yeah)
Anybody, anybody, anybody
