Yeah, as I roll up to Marvin
Tell me what's going on now or be quiet
My people, they startin' to diet
My people are starvin', they startin' to riot
It ain't black enough, I'ma dye it
Screamin' 'bout hope, I say, "Nope, I don't buy it"
Screamin' 'bout keepin' my promise and keepin' the hope in the streets
While I'm smokin' on Sweets in the suites in the Hyatt
I'm high, ain't no secret, they got to leak it
Love big or small level, more like Monique it
I need me a lighter, the heat, I'ma seek it

My squadron ride deep through regalia
Right over these crackers, green grass and azaleas
The Devil's alive, but see, God, he won't fail ya
Inhale you a pound
Then pray for who sell you a pound
Went to Hell and I'll tell you I found, don't sell out your chrondo
Get nailed to a cross and get nailed to the ground
It's 'bout to go down
There's more in your town than my town
A whole lot of soldiers and just by the minute
Gon' need more lieutenants and captains and generals
There's murder for minerals in Ghana
So I'ma blow this marijuana in honor of all of the
Daughters and mamas that live under Boko Haram
A dreamer, believer in magic, but stuck in this traffic

How is it not an issue that, according to the Department of Justice
In a study released in 2004, black and latino males
Are three times more likely than white males
To have their cars stopped and searched for drugs?
Even though white males are four and half times more likely
To actually have drugs on us on the occasion when we are stopped
Now think about that
Because that suggests that racial profiling is not just racist
We know that, that is redundant
But it's also pretty stupid-ass law enforcement, or is it?
Because I guess it's only stupid if you think the purpose
