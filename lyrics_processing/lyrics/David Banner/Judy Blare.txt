Aye mates, my name is Banner
I have a little band
It's basically just me and Watson
Alfonso and the boys
Alfonso, let's go

Oh yeah, oh yeah, they call her Judy Blaire
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, they call her Judy Blaire
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, they call her Judy Blaire
Oh yeah, I want to take her home and put her legs up in the air
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, they call her Judy Blaire
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, they call her Judy Blaire
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, they call her Judy Blaire
Oh yeah, I want to take her home and put her legs up in the air

Oh yeah, I want to take her home
Give her a loan so she can see my place
Think I wrote her number down in ink so it won't be erased
Adam and she eating, I see Eden when I see her face
Bonita Applebum, I bum her apple, I just need a taste
That model body bottle shape, I cannot escape
Wonder Woman's here and gotta wait, she ain't got no cape
Got her make-up on and got a date, these girls gotta hate
She said she gotta work out kinda late, took her outta state

When I got home in the sky
There's a space in between
There's a look in your eyes
That gets the best of me
So we can cut to the chase and get out of the lights, girl
Show me your courage, we can fly to new heights
The look in the eye says come set you free
The burning inside takes over me

Oh yeah, oh yeah, they call her Judy Blaire

Oh yeah, I think I feel in love
And I don't play with love, I love to play
Show you right, I know you right
Got prototype, that's worth two drinks
She just thinks excuses, I can't even think of words to say
She's used to dudes in tennis shoes, don't run to her, she runs away
That movie star, name in lights, Layman terms ain't her type
Money just can't buy her love and still done tried to name her price
She got it, she got it, it feels so good, I have to say it twice
Say it twice, girl you hot, girl you hot, stay on ice
When I got home in the sky
There's a space in between
There's a look in your eyes
That gets the best of me
So we can cut to the chase and get out of the lights, girl
Show me your courage, we can fly to new heights
The look in the eye says come set you free
The burning inside takes over me
