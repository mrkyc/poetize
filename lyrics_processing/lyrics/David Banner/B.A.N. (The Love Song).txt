This is for my bloods and this is for my crips
Throw your sets up, one nation in this bitch
We so quick to kill each other in the hoods where we from
But we hide the AK's when the fucking Feds come
When there's a pedophile that's lurking 'round where we stay
We turn our fucking cheek and let them faggots walk away
But God gave me a vision and now a thug sees
What would happen in the hood if the vice lords and G's
All came together; blue and red flags
Raisin a nation of black; nigga, ain't it sad
We got too many cowards that'll let them bullets fly
Cause they'd rather get paid and watch the young kids die
You mothafuckin'
