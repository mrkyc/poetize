Uh, let's put the world on mute
I, I don't care what's on the news
Now, outside is such a mess
And we don't need to stress
So just come back and hit the snooze
'Cause right now it's overdue
Yeah, outside is such a mess
But we're oblivious

On this California king size
And these thousand thread count sheets
Only got one thing my mind
And you know what I mean

I just wanna stay in bed
Oh, we can pretend the morning ain't here yet, no, not yet
No, you wanna stay in bed
Oh, I turn my phone off and lay down my head, ready, set
Wanna stay in bed, mm, yeah, mm, yeah
Oh, how you like your eggs?
Let me fix 'em for you, let's just stay in

Hold up, I got your breakfast
Oh, let's put on some Netflix
I'll never leave this room
'Cause I'm loving the view, woah

On this California king size
And these thousand thread count sheets
Only got one thing my mind
And you know what I mean

I just wanna stay in bed
Oh, we can pretend the morning ain't here yet, no, not yet
No, you wanna stay in bed
Oh, I turn my phone off and lay down my head, ready, set
Wanna stay in bed, mm, yeah, mm, yeah
Oh, how you like your eggs?
Let me fix 'em for you, let's just stay in

Yeah, uh, come on, let's do what we feel like
Time belongs to us, we can decide
I can think of some things we could do
There's a hole lot of room in this king we could utilize
Wrap you up in sheets like it's Christmas
I got everything on my wishlist
Today we're closed for business
'Cause there's a million reasons why we need to stay in bed
Oh, we can pretend the morning ain't here yet, yet
Stay in bed
Oh, I turn my phone off and lay down my head, ready, set
Wanna stay in bed, mm, yeah, mm, yeah
How you like your eggs?
How you like 'em,  let me fix 'em for you
Let's just stay in bed, mm, yeah, mm, yeah
Your whole body says and my heart it says

Let's just stay in bed, (bed), bed, (bed)
Bed, (bed), bed, (bed)
Let's just stay in bed, (bed), bed, (bed)
Bed, (bed), bed, (bed)
Let's just stay in bed, (bed), bed, (bed)
