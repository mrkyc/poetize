Did you lay your head upon his chest
Were you so close that you could feel his breath?
And were you wearing matching underwear?
I can't take it, can't take it
Did you feel safe cradled in his arms?
Did he tell you you're a work of art?
Why was the best of me not good enough?
I can't take it, can't take it

I know that you're desperate not to lose this
You've given me the best of your excuses
Thought I was yours and you were mine
I gave you all of me 'cause I believed you
When you said we were exclusive
Oh, you said I was the only one
Oh, you said I was the only one
Thought I was yours and you were mine
I gave you all of me 'cause I believed you
When you said we were exclusive

You got so used to me being the initiator
But now intimacy ain't even on my radar
'Cause my mind is on a loop
I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm thinking if you can do it once
You're bound to do it later
You might also like
I know that you're desperate not to lose this
You've given me the best of your excuses
Thought I was yours and you were mine
I gave you all of me 'cause I believed you
When you said we were exclusive
Oh, you said I was the only one
Oh, you said I was the only one
Thought I was yours and you were mine
I gave you all of me 'cause I believed you
When you said we were exclusive


Oh, you said I was the only one
Oh, you said I was the only one
Thought I was yours and you were mine
I gave you all of me 'cause I believed you
