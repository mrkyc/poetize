Keep me coming back
Yeah, keep me, keep me coming back

I keep thinking 'bout it, body on my fingertips
Crave the taste of your lips, I can't get enough of it
Going against my instincts, doing things I never would
But I don't care, 'cause it feels so good

I don't know, I don't know how you do
'Cause you got me twisted and when you're gone I miss it
I don't know, I don't know how you do
'Cause I try to let go, but it keeps me coming back
Keeps me coming back
Never wanted anything so bad, so bad, so bad
Yeah, you keep me coming back
Yeah, you keep me

Yeah, you keep me coming back
(Keep me, keep me, keep me, keep me)
Yeah, you keep me coming back
(Keep me, keep me, keep me, keep me)

I love the night in your bed
Ain't my fault, I can't resist
I gotta admit I'm not the type for serious
Your body on my body
I want more with every touch
So into you I can't give up

I don't know, I don't know how you do
'Cause you got me twisted and when you're gone I miss it
I don't know, I don't know how you do
'Cause I try to let go, but it keeps me coming back
Yeah, you keep me coming back
Never wanted anything so bad, so bad, so bad
Yeah, you keep me coming back
Yeah, you keep me

Yeah, you keep me coming back
(Keep me, keep me, keep me, keep me)
You keep me coming back
(Keep me, keep me, keep me, keep me)

Yeah, you know I would stop if I could
And I'd put up walls if I could
I know I've been burning, I should've learned
But I'm choosing my battles
'Cause nobody loves me like you
Gets me like you, touches like you
So do what you do, yeah
'Cause it keeps me
Yeah, you keep me coming back
(Keep me, keep me, keep me, keep me)
Yeah, you keep me coming back
(Keep me, keep me, keep me, keep me)
Never wanted anything so bad, bad, bad
