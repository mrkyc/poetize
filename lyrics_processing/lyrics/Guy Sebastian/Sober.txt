It's 3AM and I woke up from the light on my screen
And I knew that it was you, not psychic, it's instinct
That's just what you do

Maybe I'm way too foolish? Maybe I'm way too weak?
Maybe I only do this 'cause I know I'm in too deep?
Maybe if I was stronger I would ignore my phone?
But I guess I'm too scared of, scared of being alone

'Cause you only hit me up when you've had too much to drink
And I know it doesn't count, but I love being your mistake
So I pretend that you mean all the words that you say to me
But I know when the sun is up it's over
Tell me how to make you love me sober

Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you, make you
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you love me sober
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you, make you
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you

My head is spinning
'Cause you're so close that I get drunk of your breath
Now tell me things I know that you will regret, or forget
You hurt me so good

Maybe I'm way too foolish? Maybe I'm way too weak?
Maybe I only do this 'cause I know I'm in too deep?
Maybe if I was stronger I would ignore my phone?
But I guess I'm too scared of, scared of being alone

'Cause you only hit me up when you've had too much to drink
And I know it doesn't count, but I love being your mistake
So I pretend that you mean all the words that you say to me
But I know when the sun is up it's over
Tell me how to make you love me sober

Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you, make you
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you love me sober
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you, make you
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you love me sober
Let me pour another glass, I'll keep it flowing
And do whatever I can do to keep this going
See, I don't know who I am right now
Only you can make me lose all power
Oh, I guess I'm too scared of, scared of being alone

Tell me how to make you love me sober
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you, make you
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you love me sober
Tell me how to make you, make you
How to make you, make you
Tell me how to make you, make you
