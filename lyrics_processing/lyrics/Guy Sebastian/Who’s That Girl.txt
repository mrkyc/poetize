I was on the mic
Doin' my thing on a Friday night
Had the floor burnin' up just right
Everybody was bumpin', the club was jumpin'
Suddenly, you walked in
And that's when everybody stopped dancin'
And I couldn't stop myself starin'
Yeah, I couldn't breathe, no, I couldn't believe my eyes

I never thought I'd fall in love in a club
But now I seen you, girl, I can't get enough
With you, I know there's no taking it slow
So, can somebody please let me know

Tell me, who's that girl
Just walk, walk, walked in the club?
Tell me, who's that girl
Just walk, walk, walked in the club?
Tell me, who's that girl
Just walk, walk, walked in the club?
Just walk, walk, walked in the club?
Just walk, walk, walked, walk, walk, walked
Yeah

Before the night is through
I'ma tell ya how I feel 'bout you
And I know I got some work to do
To make you believe that you should be leavin' with me

I never thought I'd fall in love in a club
The more I get of you, I can't get enough
I won't be lettin' you leave here alone
So, can somebody please let me know

Just walk, walk, walked in the club?

I walk in the club, it's over
All them other chicks might as well move over
Wanna know my name, then you gotta get closer
Eyes on you, too, wanna get to know ya
Lemme run it down for ya, I'm not easy
Some say caramel, you can call my Evie
Wanna be the man in my life that please me
Gotta want im, once you know me, you need me
Give you whip lash when I glide through the room (Ha)
Five-inch heels, watch how I move
Watch how I shake it to the beat, how I do
Know you wanna feel me, feel me shake it on you, yeah (Ha)
The night could get crazy
But I gotta hold back, I'm a lady
Well, who knows, maybe I could be your baby
Be your baby, be your baby

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh (Who's that, walk, walked in the club)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh (Who's that, walk, walked in the club)
