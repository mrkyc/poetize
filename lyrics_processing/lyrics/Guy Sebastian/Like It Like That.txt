Aaah
Huh
Hey hey

Ain't it a funny thing
How you run to me
When he sends you spinning out of control
To the n'th degree

You know I make it right
I'm at your command
You can tell me anything you want, you know
I'm gonna understand

I won't let you down
Break it down-d-down-d-down
Never let you down, break it down

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that, hey
You might also like
So should I shut my mouth?
And should I hide my heart?
Or should I let it out into the light
That you and him should be apart?

Is he hangin' on
To every word you speak?
Does he rub your back and play with your hair
Until you fall asleep
I don't think so, baby

I won't let you down
Break it down-d-down-d-down
Never let you down, break it down

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that

Now, hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
He might say he's in love with you
But he'll never do the things that I can do
You could be your watch with the diamond band
Because I know you better than the back of my hand, now

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that?
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Now, hey-yo, do ya like it like that?
I'm the only one who can love ya like that, now

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love you like that, now
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that
I'm the only one who can love ya like that, now

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that?
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that?
Baby I'm the only one who- oh, hey, hey

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that?

Hey-yo (like it like that)
I'm the only one who can
Love ya, love ya, love ya like that
Hey-yo, do you like it like that
I'm the only one who can love you like that
(Love you like that)
Now hey-yo, do you like it like that?
I'm the only one
Tell me baby could you love me like that?

Hey-yo, do you like it like that
Now, now baby
Hey-yo (do you like it like that)
Now, now baby, yeah
No-one could love you like that

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that?
I'm the only one who can love ya like that
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that?
I'm the only one who can love ya like that, now

Hey-yo, do ya like it like that?
I'm the only one who can love ya like that, now
Hey-yo, do ya like it like that?
