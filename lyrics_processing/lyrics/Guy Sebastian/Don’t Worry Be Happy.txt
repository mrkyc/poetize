I was driving, driving, driving down the 101
Singing 'California Dreaming' at the top of my lungs
Unaware, not a care
And then he appeared
Thought he was winding down his window just to say 'hello'
But he started cussing at me, saying I'm going to slow
Then he yelled "Go to Hell"
And flipped me the bird

Is it really that bad?
Really that bad
I don't think it's really that bad
Come on, get with it

If you only think of things that you haven't got
You could have it all and still never have enough
So don't worry (don't worry), be happy (be happy)
And if you're trying to make a move
But you're stuck in mud, under water
And you don't know which way's up
Yeah, don't worry (don't worry), be happy (be happy)

Another day, another plane, another interview
Just trying hard to get thru my list of things to do
What's the use, might fake the flu
Coz I've had enough
That's it - screw the low carbs, where's my KFC?
Ain't gonna think about the bills or the GFC
Life is short - live it up
Coz we live it once
