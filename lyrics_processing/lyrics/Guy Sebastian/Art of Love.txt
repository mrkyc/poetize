I'm saying sorry in advance
'Cause this won't always go to plan
Though we don't mean to take our love for granted
It's in our nature to forget what matters
And when the goin' is getting tough
And we're all about giving up
Things that we never thought we'd say, gonna say 'em
Games that we never thought we'd play gonna play 'em
It ain't perfect (Perfect)
But it's worth it (Worth it)
And it's always getting better
It's gonna take some time to get it right

'Cause I'm still learning the art of love
I'm still tryna not mess up
So whenever I stumble, let me know (Oh)
You needa spell it out, you needa spell it out
You needa spell it out, you needa spell it out for me
'Cause I'm still tryna learn the art of love

If I forget to get the door (Get the door)
Remind you that you're beautiful
You know my detail requires more attention
If I ever hurt you its not my intention
'Cause were gonna make our mistakes
Find out how much a heart can take
But I know that you got my back
And baby, I got yours
You might also like
'Cause I'm still learning the art of love
I'm still tryna not mess up
So whenever I stumble, let me know (Oh)
You needa spell it out, you needa spell it out
You needa spell it out, you needa spell it out for me
'Cause I'm still tryna learn the art of love

Sometimes I'm gunna miss
I'm learnin' how to give
I'm not giving up
I'm learnin' how to love
Learnin' how to love
Learnin' how to love

'Cause I'm still learning the art of love
I'm still tryna not mess up
So whenever I stumble let me know
You need to spell it out, you need to spell it out
You need to spell it out you need to spell it out for me
