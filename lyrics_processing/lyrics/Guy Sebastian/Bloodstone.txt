This is a burning house, but we should stay inside
'Cause something's telling me that we should stay and fight
I know it's gonna take a lot to change your mind, oh
But baby, put your white flag down
I'm rolling up my sleeves right now

Oh no, I'm not afraid to bleed
Work my hands to the bone
More words are not what you need
I let my labor show
Can't do it on my own, I need you to believe
So please, please, squeeze
'Cause there's more in this bloodstone
Yeah, there's more in this bloodstone

There's a version of me I need to bring to light
I'm really not that asshole that I was last night
I tend to mess up every good thing in my life, oh
I'll make it up to you somehow
So, let me get to work right now

Oh no, I'm not afraid to bleed
Work my hands to the bone
More words are not what you need
I let my labor show
Can't do it on my own, I need you to believe
So please, please, squeeze
'Cause there's more in this bloodstone

So let me get to work right now
I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you
So let me get to work right now
I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you
So let me get to work right now
I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna come through somehow
I'm gonna come through somehow
I'm gonna come through somehow
Oh no, I'm not afraid to bleed

Oh no, I'm not afraid to bleed
Work my hands to the bone
More words are not what you need
I let my labor show
Can't do it on my own, I need you to believe
So please, please
'Cause there's more in this bloodstone

I know, I know, that there's more in this bloodstone
Believe me, believe me, that there's more in this bloodstone
I know and you know, there's no walking away
