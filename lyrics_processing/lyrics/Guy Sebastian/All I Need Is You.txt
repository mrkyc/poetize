You're all that I need
You're all (yeah)
You're all that I need
I remember in a day
Being all so independent
I remember how I'd say
'I can never fall', I was cynical
Funny now in the days
Since you came into my life
Now I'm other than the same
Baby I'm amazed by the love you gave
Finally I can see
What life really means to me
To me babe
All I need is you in my life forever
All I need is you everyday by my side
Got to let you know you're the one that I treasure
I can search the world but never find
A better love that is between you and I
All I need is you
Yeh
Ooh
Yeh
Aww

Got to let you know you're the one that I treasure

Got to let you know you're the one that I treasure
