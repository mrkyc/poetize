La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da

Hold up
This feeling's got me bubblin' like a soda
So why you tryna to give me cold shoulders?
I swear I'm not the same no more
I'm not the type to go and play these games no more
I know I learned that lesson in my mind, my mind
Yeah, it's like you keep me guessin' by design

I'm really feeling that bounce, I got the beat again
Got the song that'll get me on my feet again
So are you down? We should meet again
Checkin' ticks off my list, now the only thing missin' is you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, all I'm missin' is you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, ooh

Listen
I'm gonna shoot a shot and I ain't missin'
It's time to cash out on all my wishes
I ain't rollin' dice no more
Vegas for the night no more
It's the way you go and bring me back to life, to life
That's the reason why I'm goin' all in tonight
You might also like
I'm really feeling that bounce, I got the beat again
Got the song that'll get me on my feet again
Are you down? We should meet again
Checkin' ticks off my list, now the only thing missin' is you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, all I'm missin' is you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh-ooh

You're all I do this for (You're all I do this for)
So walk through my open door
I want you here with me (Here with me)
You're the air I breathe (Air I breathe)
Got me incomplete, now all I'm missin' is you, ooh


Oh, I'm really feeling that bounce, I got the beat again
Got the song that'll get me on my feet again
Are you down? We should meet again
Checkin' ticks off my list, but the only thing missin' is you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, all I'm missin' is you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh-ooh

You, ooh
All I'm missin' is you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You, ooh
