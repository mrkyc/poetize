Long Live the Kings
Kings and Queens, raise your glass as I propose a toast
To the long living legacy, of the Kottonmouth Kings

What's good here we got the game on lock
We ain't goin nowhere, we still sittin on top
We still doing our thing
We still raining supreme
That's why everywhere we go they're yelling Kottonmouth Kings

Yo, whoever thought these rowdy whities from the Southern California, Orange County
Would still be pushin and poundin
Our beats in the streets and smokin fifteen years later
Some say it's an incredible feat like the rebound of the Lakers
So I'm here to thank the people who that it all possible
The kings and queens close to the crew that's out on the road
My homies at the noize in the warehouse shipping stage
Johnny Richter I'm ya boy, and these colors never change
D-Loc back again
Blaze the weed you can ask a friend
Load a bowl, burn the head
Let the games begin so here we go
Yeah, Yeah on the road
Place blow, Kottonmouth killin shows
Fuck the hoes, 13 we still in a row
Killin the flow
Killin the show
Killin the chronic, we killin the dough
Fiddna Show
Fiddna Dro
We feelin the fun so now ya know
Kottonmouth bitch, you can get a taste of it
D-Loc the name trick
Bitch I'll make ya fainted

We still got it, we still got it on lock
It's like a lifetime warranty, that won't ever stop
I'm packin clips in the Glock
We still be keepin it hot
Holdin that number 1 spot
We still be runnin our block
So when we dead and gone
They still be banging these songs
When they packin their bongs
And chillin out on their lawns
This is history, legendary outlaw music
Made for the people, so the people always choose it
Kottonmouth Kings, man a lifetime dynasty
Underground piracy
A sick high society
Subnoize family
Lives through eternity
Beyond infinity and cannibus trinity

Long Live The Kings
Kings and Kweens, gather round as we bare witness
To the dawning of a new era
As we crown the newest King, The Dirtball
Thank you everybody, thank you yep yep yeah
These move right here speaks for itself
So let me pull it up from the top shelf
And increase the wealth
Of the Kottonmouth family
Forever we shall stay
Put your joints to the sky and hear me when I say
Yo, What up, what up I be the new B
You can call me DBall roll me up a doobie
Northwest King gunner in town better duck down
When I pull the trigger back
This time we be takin' over every thing
Ima bet we be tripling the money ring
Ocatane, Superfy
Automatic, I'm alive
Ready for the drive
As the gavel goes boom I silence the room
And we bringin the newest to make it balloon
I'm one of the freshest around
And now with the crown
