Let us plant trees that bear positive fruits
And nourish our youth with compassionate truth
That enlighten our minds to the deepest roots
All the way to the core
Where the soul can stay true
Where I can, walk free with a joint in my hand
And I can plant plants right upon my land
Help em, understand these are natures laws

Now when the love is lost and your spirits are low
The world's closing in around you got no place to go
Done all that you could to ease and please another soul
And in the end you're in the cold, another sad story told
That's why I make my own decisions on how I'm liven
Try to get by with the knowledge that I'm given
Can't make me believe cause a tree is a tree
And when my soul bleeds, the color that I'm spillin is green

I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life
You can find me postin on my porch, tokin on the pipe
I'm gonna smoke weed for the rest of my life
See I'm in love with Mary Jane I'm gonna make her my wife, Yeah
