It's time for 'Real Talk' with Bobby B
Attention young ladies, attention young ladies
Man homeboy's over here in the garage with 4 1000's
Powder nutrients growing in the dirt
Takin' 4 and a half months not even getting a full peak
Ya know, ya know, ya know
In a room the size of a telephone booth
Using liquid nutrients, (buds swell rock, wool?)
One 1000 watt high pressure sodium
(kevorki?) buds the size of a fuckin' Volkswagen
Ya know what I'm talkin' about, you do the math motherfucker
What's up smokers?
Another suburban noize joint for you to pull on
Stoners Reeking Havoc

I'ma get you so high, I'ma make that ass fly
Hit the bong, stand by
I'ma get you so high

Back up off me, I need room to puff
Fuck Babylon, man I can't get enough
I smoke, so I like it going down
We're all getting lifted cuz I just stole a pound
Two hits and pass, that's what Saint's yellin
Fuck that shit, I'm hittin till my mind's jelly
And when I'm done, I'll head to Flannagan's
To play some pool and that's with a couple friends
Grab a sack, it's off to a local park
Break out the bong, pack it tight and let it spark
Windows up so the bug's gettin fishbowled
And if you're in you can't escape the indo
Oh shit, it's gettin deep into my mind
I took 7 hits off that bud called kind
Close my eyes, my mind starts joggin
Here I go again, man, my mind's boggling
See Kottonmouth Kings LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like
I'ma get you so high, mind boggling
I'ma make that ass fly, mind boggling
Hit the bong stand by, mind boggling
I'ma get you so high

Here I go reminiscing about the weekend
Takin time to remember where my shit has been
Dinner to dancing, fly girl romancing
Ballin with the homies, smoking buds and relaxin
(?) that shit is how I was smoking
Fuck this schwag weed, indo is what I'm tokin
Splif to my lips as I tilt my head back
Lookin like a mack cuz I'm down to blaze a sack
I said inhale, exhale, kottonmouth hits so I said 'that's swell'
Pass a tweak to the left, party busters set in
I need some fresh air cuz I'm high off that in
Walked towards the door but man I didn't get far
High kicked in, I took a seat at the bar
As I look into the sky and the air starts fogging
Here I go again, yo my mind's boggling

I'ma get you so high, mind boggling
I'ma make that ass fly, mind boggling
Hit the bong stand by, mind boggling
I'ma get you so high
Here I go getting deeper into my mind again
Thinking bout good times, smoking kind again
By myself so you say, am I a stoner or a loner
Man I can't cope with this lil hell that I'm livin in
I got family members fiending from the cocaine
And loved ones locked up in prison
That's why I'm bailin' ya'll, man fuck the system!
All the pressures of this life get me frustrated
So I reach for the bong so I can get faded
I blaze a bowl and it take me to another level
To escape the pain and all my life's trouble
Close my eyes, pray take the pain away
Ask the lord should I live to see another day
Rob Harris died, I guess this is one of life's little tests
...take a bullet to the chest
(Money can't buy me my?) first real true love
Died at 23, now she's waitin for me up above
Get the pipe, pack it tight, start hoggin
