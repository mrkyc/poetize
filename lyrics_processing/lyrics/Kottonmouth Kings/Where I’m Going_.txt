It's funny thing too sometimes
On the road of life it's full of surprises
Twist and turns we look toward the sky for some guidance
The sun goes down and it rises
Withstood the sands of time
And we'll find new horizons

Sometimes I lay awake at night and try to figure it out
Is my life going north is it heading south
I'm walking on a fence between wrong and right
Trying to keep a level head try to keep my goals in sight
It's hard as hell in this world today friends
I've known for many years started acting strange
Things I cared about before seemed to just fade away
Now I'm left with these questions of today
"When is the train ganna get back on track
When am I even ganna care bout that
Why do I always get delt the bad cards
Took the easy the road so long and now my lifes hard"
Still I try to make it work out for the best
And I know I've gatta clean up all this mess
If I knew when I started where this all would end
I'd prolly do it all over again

I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I went from having a little to having a lot
I went from buying weed to growing pot
I don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I've seen some people cry cause loved one's die
I've looked in people's eyes and told some lies (yeah)

Skies are blue and the trees are grand
Going to the place where life froze in between
The beautiful hills mountains and streams
The Mans country with my women living free
Stay on my path follow my road
Do all the right things to achieve my goals
Perusing my dream in life I lead
Become who I want when I want anytime I please
I no where I'm going
If I keep it on track
Just stay on my line only time will tell
I pray to the one over looking my trail

I've been criticized
For speaking my mind
Been baptized in lies
Given bad advice
Here's a word to the wise
Never compromise
Watch your back
As you watch your ends multiply
Look a man in his eyes
And never ever say die
Keep your eye on the prize
And you'll stay on the rise
I'm a king world wide
And I'm going to stay on the ground
I've been behind the glass but I always rebound
Outlet quick live life in the fast lane
Inbound Outbound my stride don't change
Stay true to myself cause I created this game
I got the whole world jumpin like the house of pain (jump)
