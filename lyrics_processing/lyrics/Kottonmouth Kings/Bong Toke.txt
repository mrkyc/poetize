I love rippin' outta bongs it gets me so so high
When I take a big toke 'looks like my eyes start to cry
Tears start to swell up when I take a huge hit
Of that bong biggie bong diggity dank dank shit
Johnny Richter don't quit out the one two three
Take so many bong hits you might run out of weed
Thought you was fucking with a rookie but I'm really a king
I was just out playing hooky having fun with my team
Well now I'm back with a plan to get the whole world united
The plan's called bong tokes first you pack it then light it
Then you pass it to a friend and keep on paying it forward
Until we all live as one to form a weed world order

Take a bong toke, take a toke, and another toke
Where's the weed at?

It's time to put the chronic in the chamber
The bong water needs a little change up
I throw a fast ball right down the strike zone
And split the bat up to stick in the glass bowl
Mountain Spring always goes down the freshest
Before we spark it up, D-Loc you must inspect it
Dirty water's like a sin to a christian
You want heaven but you never gonna get in
The high priest baptizes and purifies
The canni-bus now we're all getting herbalized
Pass the lighter spark the holy chalice
The Mavericks ain't the same since Steve Nash left Dallas
Sprinkle on the keef yeah adds a nice topping
We getting' baked like hash cakes there's no stopping
The water's bubbling my vision starts doubling
The smoke's rising fast I pull the stem it comes rushing in

Liar liar
Hey naw
Liar liar pants on fire ain't nobody getting no higher
Fuck that, where's my lighter
Sick of all you lyin' typers
We getting higher higher smoking on a vaporizer
Eyes red blazed up smoked out I'm tired as fuck
We got that supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
The type of weed that leave you breathless and flow less
So take a toke
And another
And another
And another
Tell your mother
Oh no!
