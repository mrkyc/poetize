Say goodbye to a tangerine sky
Say hello say hello to tomorrow
When you say goodbye to a tangerine sky
You lose your pain, lose your fear, lose your sorrow

What if you were living yours instead of hatin mine
Finding truth and spreading love and searching deep inside
See me gliding swiftly to that place I need to be
That home grown irie zone, harvesting my seeds
I'm gonna live my life from day to night with no hesitation
Make the best of every situation that I find myself placed in
Deciding right from wrong, choosing my final destination
Cause when it's said and done, it's just yourself that you are facing, so

Say goodbye to a tangerine sky
Say hello, say hello to tomorrow (Say Good-bye)
When you say goodbye to a tangerine sky
You lose your pain, lose your fear, lose your sorrow (Say Good-bye)

Say hello, say hello to tomorrow (Say Good-bye)

Say say say say say say say
Say good-bye to tomorrow
Wash your sorrow
Live and learn
Listen up and follow
Do what you want, so let me rock it
I be dammed if you think you gonna stop it
Pop it drop it, d-loc get up on it
Don't you think your slick cause you can't call it
I be the one that balled you up in college
Killa cross just brake you down
Kottonmouth Kings on the radio now
Make you think when you see my face
D-loc (That's me) with style and grace
I wanna touch the sky unleash control
Wanna feel time travel, real through my soul
Wanna ride real high
Wanna lay real low
Independent free thought control my zone
My zones full blown like a plant full grown
Transform myself thru this microphone
Hold up - change that tone
Johnny Richter come through with your baritone
It's time to open up your eyes and catch sight
Cause you could wake up in the morning, and not make it to the night
Take advantage of your life, you only get one try
You gonna be satisfied today if tonight you died?
Well I'm not that guy, I keep my blood running
You say you've had enough, and I say keep it coming
Now you're bummed because you're done and you're left all alone
Should've known living blown you'd end up like a clone (Whaaaat! )
