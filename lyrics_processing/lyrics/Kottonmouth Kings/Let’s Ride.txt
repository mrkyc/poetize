You ride you ride
Double, double, double dash L-O-C
See me gettin' whipped on that real smooth shit
Layed down like a G with that 60's
All dressed down in black
Ready to crack with anybody
Uh yeah you better be prepared
When i'm on my dirtbike you better be aware
When the gate drops i'm on the gas kickin rocks
Caught me up the hole shot
For the wide lead the box
See when the starting gate drops
Everybody's on the gas
Puttin' people in the corners
And makin' the pass
Tryin' to find the quickest line
Shavin seconds off your time
I got the best record its fine its all mine
You smell what i sizzel, shift into second gizzel
Pin it through the roof then
Hit third for the tripple
Cause when i'm on my motorcicle
Call me Richter the racer and when
I'm on the podium i'm sittin' in first place

I got back yall riverside get down and dirty
When i ride style, always gettin' buck wild
Off the wall, off the chain
Everybody know i flame, all the people
In the place everybody knows my name
The hottness i drop this
The buisness the realness
I'm fearless wanna step up in the game
I'm mentally insane bring the pleasure and the pain
Lean back on the track get smacked like that
Cause we doin' things and we ain't gonna stop
Willies on the 50's up and down the block
Well big pop commin' through on a quad
He's getting there by the key(?)
And he revs on his yamaha

You ride you ride
Beatin' on em' then comes the X
Kickin' dirt in teeth like the old school bet
In my white checks i'm easy to find(?)
Catch me, with the ladies on the sidelines
No gas in my tank, sponsers to thank
Thrown out the industry
Cursed by the ministry
Started reakin havoc getting busy what
I'm a sick boy laid back
Easy ride back up son
I'm a stealth jet fighter
Lyrical provider high times diver
Extra extra extra extra ex
Read all about it, do the math
