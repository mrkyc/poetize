Life is good you know, plant your see and watch it grow, ya
One seed, two seed, three, four, and five
How many of these seeds can they keep alive and so I'm singing (singing)
Here in my garden (here in my garden)
I'm harvesting everything with love (love )
And it gets passed around (woa oh oh oh oh)
I'm planting my garden (planting my garden)
Harvesting everything with love (love )
The sun keeps shinning down (woa oh oh oh oh)

One seed, two seed, three, four, and five
How many of these seeds can they keep alive and so I'm singing (singing)
Don't you know the fact my gardens sacred
Ain't nobody gonna come and rape it ain't nobody gonna come and take it
Its my whole life
Love and passion consumes the reaction
Now feed them the feelings that grow them so high
We've been baby the blossoms partaking
What's awesome and spread out the world that's no lie

I love it when spring comes around
I love putting seeds in the ground
But look what's this that I found?
Could it be another piece of the puzzle?
Looks like a baby tree, pass me a shovel
So I can dig it up and put it in a nice place
Might be trainwreck, mite be silver haze
Well anyways Ima move it to a better spot
So it can get sunlight and be some better pot

 chronic always burning on a bag
Got the good buds even got a little hash
Calling me a plane always flying through the sky
Captain chronic, I'm super duper high
I'm super duper fly
I'm a super duper guy
Never spill a bong always got a clean pipe
If you wanna come along stand by my side
Take a hit of this get ready for the ride
I'm a take a hit of that and you take a hit of this
Roll a fat fatter makes cannabis bliss
Cause where I live everybody's got weed to give
So where I live cover up our eyeballs, u dig?
We get so high so cal 
Everything things always better cause we so smoked out
Kottonmouth Kings and we won't slow down
Still blowing smoke rings bitch watch what now

Snacks stay open like 7-11
I smoke my bud like 24/7
Get a tight pack never dry in the bag
It was kinda blunt wrapped but  high as the heavens
If I get goes pro then I won't fold
Roll the swift man fire with the 
Drop pop pop, that bowl
Poppidy pop pop my load!

Its harvest time the moon was shine pure magic in the air
That universal miracle like drum sticks on a snare
That cycling the seasons change the healing that repairs
We pass around the sacred pipe then hold it in the air
We blow the smoke in 4 directions giving thanks each time
Then nothing can reward the gods like fruit at harvest time
So plant your seeds and love the soil and water it each day
And live your life with pure intention good things will come your way
(so they say)
