All my friends are stoners
Everyone i know gets high
Maybe there's a reason why
Weeds not legalized
(maybe their afraid)

Why people always be afraid of what they don't know
Or understand, can't comprehend the info so old
The reefer madness video is purely propaganda
A movie made to scare all the kids in Alabama
Maybe they'er afraid and think they might loose control
Insteed of embracin, its many use, performin the medical
Its pathetic though, that pharmaceutical companies can
Make you feel from high to low
It seems its all about the money, funny cuz

All my friends are stoners
Everyone i know gets high
Maybe there's a reason why
Weeds not legalized
(still not legalized)
Maybe they're afraid
Of too much peace and harmony
(peace and harmony)
Maybe they're afraid of
Open minds and people free
(maybe they're afraid)

Until my people free'd
When they turn the ganja plant
Into an evil weed
(maybe they're afraid)

Check this So many friends that i know
Have suffered the lies the government strangers
Into the ground and legally bound and never be angled
Even the law-makers are makin' the laws are smokin'
The bong and deep in the Chronic
And nobdy hearin' the voice of the weed, i find it ironic
So how do we govern the dangers of not becoming too hostile.?
Not losin' the mind, not crossin' the line, not feelin' colossal
There's only one avenue we can be sure that we gettin' our justice
The legalization, the love of the weed, they tryin' ta bust us


We got a black president before weed's legal
In my mind in my time that shit's unbelievable
I love obama, i love all people
I just can't believe that a plant's not legal
A plant, a seed, that grows in the soil
And they still fightin' bloody wars over oil.?
Reefer madness is used as propaganda
Fear is a tool that they use to command us
So understand us: we don't fear no plant
We don't fear no plant
All iv been doin is smokin the kush
Harvest the chorn sunk two in the bush
Perfect my flow pull of the buds
Im rollin em up there ready to blow
Trippin and dippin and smokin the bomb sippin the wine
Packin my bowl its down in the hole
Im makin her cheese im lettin her know
Rubbin it lovin it taste so good
Im bringing my chainsaw choppin the wood (so why they so afraid)
Maybe afraid of the weed that we're smokin
Is candy and coated we're rollin bolder
Than peppin an office that won't make it legal
Stand up for my righteous,they dont believe you
