Another day gone
Sittin in mah livin room pullin on sum tubes
No more bubble berry so I settled for the blues
Snapped it thru and my lungs start to hurt
Hold it in long enough to put your dick in the dirt
And people go beZeRk tryin to get there hands on it
Most common heard phrases 'Richters got tha chRoniC'
So I'm on it
Matter fact I'm on the top
Can't nobody fuck wit me or the killa kali crops
Like reeboks yo I'm unstopable and the bowls that I pack are unpoppable
So what you grow? all I wanna know is what seeds
What system you usin? you got the lites you need?
You gotta mess with the greed from the weed I believe
Is you a cop without a clue jus lookin for a need
Life rolls on
Passin by yo eyes so fast
Another 24' another day has passed
Life rolls on

I think its time to grow again
Fuck it
If your gonna grow you better come pik up your bucket
Alrite I'm comin thru
'Ay yo grab some mountain dew ..wha!?
A pack of zig zagz and a couple a brewS
I cruise thru in the blue 2 with the bass tubes
I too got the big bumps keep my caddy dumped
Dont front on this trunk stump on mah bangin bus
Well he rumped on the blunt spot turn that shit to dust
Dust till dawn jus like the modern day Cheech and Chong
Tim and Dustin on the bong smokin mad amounts of ganj'
Writin songs playin pong we be ****signin off the law****
Stealin ciggarettes and bongs we was kids gettin it on
But now I grow.. standin strong 2000 and beyond
Too dawns hit the bong used to fight to get along
That was way back then and this iz rite now
We're on a mission to get it smoke it
And blow tha hell out
Life rolls on

Another day gone another day gone another day gone life rolls on
Another day gone another day gone another day gone life rolls on
Theres 4hundred and 20 wayz to blaze
Choose one It taste great
When you smokin out the vape
Mon hey, sit back need to put you in a trance
Grab ur sac relax
An thro your cap up on the hat rack
Thro ur feet up recline jus chill
We jus smoked an eighth of the muthafukin kill
Fo real hold it in now we goin on a ride
The bud inside ain't nuthin to fuck wit
So santa cruz that we got our jobs crypt
The crypt that you never find aroun
The reason you can't find it in your city or ur town
Becuz it sits in my bedroom in piles and mounds
We got pound and pounds that the world dont know about
If I sold it.. "yo theyd all be in the clouds"
Chillin out without a doubt its not fo the money
Its all fo the head n gettin stOnEd with my homies
Life rolls on
Passin by yo eyes so fast
