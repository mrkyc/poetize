Hi kids
Welcome to cloud nine
We sure are glad ya stopped by to see us!
We got some special surprises for your red eyeses tonight
We got the Insane Clown Posse
In the studio with the Kottonmouth kings
Put your thinkin' caps on and think for yourself!

Think for yourself man don't do like they do
It's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool
You gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves
(Come on, man) Think for yourself man don't do like they do
It's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
(Come on, man) Stay true and everything'll be cool
You gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves
(Come on, man)

This life time here, shit's kinda funny
Seems like everybody's out for the money
Everybody's chasin' fake fortune and fame
The worlds gone insane it's like we lost our brain
Got the paparazzi snappin' pop culture
We feedin' on the copies like a pack of vultures
I don't give a fuck about Britney or Rehab
She gobble nuts (Yummy) and look like a skinhead
Lindsay Lohan can swim in the ocean (Ha ha)
With two cement shoes and some calamine lotion (Bye-bye)
Paris Hilton can be worth a billion (Ew)
I wouldn't fuck that bitch with Madonna's ten children (Hell no)
 or Angie Jolina
Can drink pipe cleaner from missadobaleena
Missadobbaleena missabobdobbaleena
I gotta big fat spliff with patron to killa

Ryan Seacrest gets a fist through his weak chest
And all the millionaire hot hoes get skeet spits
I gives a fuck who's drunk and fuckin' at the Grammy's
Loco breakin up or too fuckin' skinny
Lil kids walking home mad miles a day
'Cause they moms ain't tryin to fuckin' miss Judge Judy
I will stab yo ass! I'll slice your ass to Alaska
I think for myself like a samuari has to
Who is who or anybody else to review what anybody else do
And who the fuck is who to tell you
Ask the magic eight ball, call the psychic hotline
I don't need your opinion on shit 'cause I got mine
Think for yourself original and authentic
With this fresh lifetime we get to ride on this planet
There's two many followers, dumbasses by the masses
You better think so hard you fuckin' shatter your glasses
Think for yourself man don't do like they do
It's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool
You gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves
(Come on, man) Think for yourself man don't do like they do
It's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
(Come on, man) Stay true and everything'll be cool
You gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves
(Come on, man)

I make my own moves so I set my own pace
I got my own rules double-dash is the name
I do my own thing like the president does
Sometimes I'm like fuck the world 'cause I don't give a fuck
When I do it let's do it
Every time we gettin to it yeah yeah we gettin to it
Clowns and the Kings we back at it again
You know we dippin' again, so go run and tell ya friends

Go and tell ya friends, better yet, alert the public
Kottonmouth kings with ICP and people lovin it
Think for yaself 'cause I'm thinkin' 'bout me
Havin' fun in my life and makin' sure my family
Never has to worry bout the bullshit at hand
Takin care a everbody livin in my own land
Take a picture 'cause it lasts longer face the fame
Id rather do my own thing than play ya sick little game
Think for yourself man don't do like they do
It's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
(Come on, man) Stay true and everything'll be cool
You gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves
(Come on, man) Think for yourself man don't do like they do
It's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
(Come on, man) Stay true and everything'll be cool
You gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves
(Come on, man)
