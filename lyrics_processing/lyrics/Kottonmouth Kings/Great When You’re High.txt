The same mother fucker you'll be seeing in pictures
With a bong, a joint, a pipe, or a big bag
The crickedy cronic that I always seam to have
Yes I, always seem to have a little som'em som'em
And I, always got the pot that keeps the people com'in
And you, you know can't repeat the words?
So I, just sit back, relax, an get high with the women
Blowin tokes while getting blown, nottin the flow
Johnny Ritcher, plus a ho, plus a bag of enduo, Oooooooooooooo...
And thats the shit that people wants to dream about
Makes you want to scream and shout
The words that once came out your mouth
Damn baby, you need to relax on that thing
Treat that thing like a nice glass peice
Who wants to get their high on
? (get your high on)
Fire up the vaperizer
Go clean out that bong (get your high on)
Who wants to get their high on
Higher than Babylon (get your high on)
Speek to your massier (?)
Come along hit the bong (get your high on)
Simon says...
Shut the fuck up if you anit got no weed
You better back the fuck up if you got sticks and seed
D double dash? say I got the bombest
Everybody claiming that the B.C. is cronic
Why, do you always smoke when you know you buds dawgen (?)
I smoke that purple cush, green crack, lemon super silver haze
So now, you know what the fuck I mean when I say canja (canja) canja
Not a day go by, red eyed, dont ask why
Tonights the night for me to let smoke fly
If your down for the crown everybody get high

(Stoned, lets get stoned) (Stoned, lets get stoned)
I wanna get stoned now, releive my stress level
Decompress, elevate like a soul rebel (?)
Expand my mind, let my sensers (?) run free
Losse track of time, let time grab a hold of me
I'm uplifted, my spirits risin
I'm on couch-lock this ain't suprisin
I got the munchies seein new horizens
Eyes goin south bond now were vaporizen
I smoke a Dutch, Dragon, Magic Bud, Skunk-one
Purple Haze, Donkey Dick, Hinduo, Cush, Chocolate Chump
Cotton Candy, White Widow, Cali Mist, and Bubble Gum
Blue Berry, Mothers Finest, making pease with everyone
And just think, this nights just begun. haha get your high on
