Come, come, come, come, come here
Let's walk & talk so we can hear each others side
You huff & puff & stuff & seem to think that you're alright
We try to see eye to eye but the truth there is no compromise
You staring at the moon we lookin up at the sunrise
So come please take my hand & try to understand
That what you're really afraid of is just a little plant
That comes from the earth with water sunlight through love
Unless you growin hydroponics indo then it's some tubs or buckets
Fuck it's sticky big ole nuggets we love it & you can suck it
If u out there hatin on me in public cause I'm
Above it man I'm like a bird in the breeze
Smokin my trees me & weed as high as can be
Can anybody hear me, does anybody feel what I'm sayin &
Is there anybody out there who feels freedom from sayin
Can anybody hear me 

You say it's wrong but feels so right
When I rip my bong or hit my pipe
You wanna lock me up and lose the keys
I wanna live in peace and smoke my weed

Can anybody hear me
Can anybody hear me
How these years go
Times just flyin by
All the times we spent
Doin shows and gettin high
I can't lie I feel blessed
Just to be alive on the frontline
I saw some friends and family die
So many times I think how life could have been
If I could afford to be an upright citizen
I never been that type to believe the hype
I been grimy hardcore almost all my life
I like pushin limits walkin on the edge
I love the feelin when the ganga seeps into my head
So in my dyin days I don't want no regrets I wanna
Go out blazin
