If getting drunk was a sport I'd be an all-star
Catch me at the bar raisin' the bar with another side car
Moonshine out the jar, kush out my cigar
As I roll a golf cart on the course chasing pars
Drivin' like I'm NASCAR
I really I'm in it playing video games lit
Like I'm in to win it when on the beer pong
We can play til your finished Just bring some cups
And a something I got a case of Guinness
I'm a professinal man popping tops with my lighter
I'm like the Donald Trump of drinking and homie your fired
Stayin' higher than the competition call me your a sire
I'll be a Kottonmouth King til' I'm dead and expired
Never retire, never say die, never slow down
As long as I'm breathin' I'll be repin' the crown and repping my town
Placentia 'till I'm six in the ground
Let's get some wraps and some pounds
And some fuckin' more rounds
(I said)
See Kottonmouth Kings LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like

I camped in the coup
I'm getting loose off the juice
Getting drunk in this bitch
Getting drunk in this bitch
Hat cocked low, pants sag to da flo'
Gotta big tittied bitch
(Body rockin' to the flow)
Yo! You know you want her
Gotta hold her when you have it
Grab it, love it, cause you need it
Best believe I be pimping 'em
Smokin' and sipping
Double dash when I'm flipping
And you think you can fuck with me (haha)
Kickin' ass, taking names, as I throw these claims
You know I'm still claiming PTB
Kickin' ass, taking names as I throw these claims
You know I'm still claiming PTB
So motion with the potion
I proceed to make my eyes bleed
Little's not enough
Bomb trees when I puff
Faces with the chronic, throw it up, speed with the bluff
Things you love the chronic buzz
Hustler-d with it cuz

We start the day with a little splish-splash
Some O.J., vodka chased by some kodiak
To get your head buzzing
With a little something-something
We get em' buzzing til the girls are like kissing cousins
Margareta drinks are dancing in the blender
Top shelf is what we drink when we going on a bender
The sun is shining down and my shoes are getting wet
I'm a 'G' from the old skool (eh mr. Bartender)
Drinks are on the house Come from Mr. Daddy X
And the best for the guests from the Kottonmouth Krest
Manifest and sex quest in the cage from the west
We infest the nest like a game of roulette
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
Now all are lyin' face down on the floor
And we goin' back for more
Like true can kiss a door
Swinging swords like lords with a microphone cord
