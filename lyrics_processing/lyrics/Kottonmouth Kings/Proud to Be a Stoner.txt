All these people sitting on their high horses
Looking down on us for smoking a plant or growing a plant
Well I belive in natures laws, and I just wanna be free
From the mountain tops, where the wind blows
To the green valleys down below
Where the snow melts and the rivers flow
I just want to live my life
Where the trees grow, and the air is clean
Where nature's free do to her thing, everything is one if you know what I mean
I just want to live my life
Im proud to be a stoner, im proud to be a stoner, im proud to be a stoner
Yes I am, for the rest of my days
I started smokin weed at the age of 18
I moved out my house started writing rap beats
I moved to hollywood, we was up in the scene
It was Dloc, johnny rich, and my home boy steve
We was, teenagers, yeah living a dream
Lookin up to daddy x, tryin to do this rap thing
Wrote the first couple songs it was "Bump bump" we was "So high" gettin blown off the skunk
15's in the trunk down Melrose
Bitches in the club, gettin drunk spittin flows
Tryin to get a record deal, we gettin signed
I was broke with no money, and that was back in 95
Im proud to smoke weed, and im proud of what we've done
Im proud of the kings, and im proud of everyone
Im proud my name is Dloc, no joke son
And i'll be proud when im a dad, when I have a daughter or a son

Its those lazy days
And the hazy days
And the days we get stoned for just days and days
Its amazing when we get to live this way, like every day is a holiday
At the harvest time, when the work is done
And I celebrate by worshiping the earth and the sun
We always give thanks, for life and the gifts
The higher you climb, its the higher you get
You gotta disconnect, from all the pressure and stress
The traffic, the smog and the pains of rent
If thats real livin, its not for me
I wanna be free, and live in peace, come on

Yes I am, for the rest of my days
Another version of life lived, a different set of meanings
Another way of thinking, a different type of me
A brand new religion, one that has never been rehearsed
But its cursed, and this curse could mean the end of this earth
So many people worrie about the troubles that they got at hand
To many simple solutions to restoring this land
And when its all said and done
And were gonna tell our kids that we did the best we could
But we know that we didn't
Its gettin crazy, summers hot, when its freezin
Huricans getting stronger tearin up the southern regions
Big fires taking lifes, Its pure destruction
Were at a fork in the road, time to choose the right junction
Before theirs nothing left
We need to stop this regression
Get all the leaders of the world together in a session
Only thing, if theirs a shot that if our kids would thrive in a world that is growin, I just
Wanna survive
From the mountain tops, where the wind blows
To the green valleys down below
Where the snow melts and the rivers flow
I just want to live my life
Where the trees grow, and the air is clean
Where nature's free do to her thing, everything is one if you know what I mean
I just want to live my life
Im proud to be a stoner, im proud to be a stoner, im proud to be a stoner
Yes I am, for the rest of my days
Im proud to be a stoner, im proud to be a stoner, im proud to be a stoner
