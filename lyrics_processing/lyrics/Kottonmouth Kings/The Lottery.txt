Ain't shit Changed just a Big Game
They fuckin' with our brain, it's the Government Strain
Taxes stealin' but they got you trained
The Lottery, you know It's all the Same
Ain't shit Changed just a Big Game
They fuckin' with our brain, it's the Government Strain
Taxes stealin' but they got you trained
Up early in the morning before the sun rise
Scrapin' out my pipe tryin' to Stay High
I gotta get blunted for the nine to five
And I need a facelift on my oldschool ride
My scrapin' change to meet the range of my job qualification
But I'm stealin' cable, so I get every station
Now don't let em slay you when they tell you somethings free
They take about half with the taxes fee
But now I'm up in new times just blowin' out some fog
Don't gotta work cuz I quit my fuckin' job
Walk into my room to a sixty inch tele
And I got a phat deal on my star-tac cele
I finally got a chance to hook my ride up legit
They asked how big I want it, I said biggest that would fit
On airbags it would sit, shit was lookin' sick
System was in it and all I did was pick six

If I won the Lotto, I'd buy pounds of Bud
Give it to my homies to show I got love
Dirtbikes and buggies and four wheel drives
I own my own jet, ah yo, I'm world wide
First class fast, take a trip over seas
Me, my girl Ami makin' love on the beach
I just bought a yacht, I just won the Lottery
Never ending buds in my cultivation
So I can smoke out the world in the hempalation
Give some money to my pops, buy my mom a new house
Or anything she wants, no rush just pick it out
Don't worry about the ends plenty bread to be broke
I'll open a skate shop and sell bags of dope
Blow custom glass so I smoke days of hits
I build a greenhouse where my hydro sit
No questions planes trains just to keep you guessin'
The lottery, L-O-T-T-E-R-Y
Money signs, green backs, honey blunts and fat sacks
Everything I want and everything I need
A different house for each day of the week
A private lake so I could jet ski
In the back a duck blind so I shoot geese with my dad
Mini bikes and go-karts I want it all
The Universal Walk, fuck it i'll buy the mall

A buck with your booze, What the fuck when I lose
Which one you chose when your baby needs shoes
A buck with your booze, What the fuck when I lose
Which one you chose when your baby needs shoes

Which one you chose when your baby needs shoes
A buck with your booze, What the fuck when I lose

Since I won the lottery I bought a yacht to fish
I spent a fifth on a house with a satelite dish
I bought a brewery and walk around all day with double fists
And got at least ten pots so I can puke and piss
I got a glass bong for everyday of the week
And yes I stand strong make sure all my family can eat
I bought a fleet of cars all of them V-W
I purchased Yorba Linda made it Richter Avenue
How many of you have had the thought of winnin' the grand prize
All the fat ladies dreamin' of some smaller thighs
And all the guys with your bills stacked up to your eyes
Wouldn't blow your pay checks tryin' to get high
I fly from coast to coast and then I flipped a bitch
On my private leer jet smokin' a pound of krypt
Hired my help from you, my fridge is stocked with Dew
Me and my krew takin' trips to Katmandu
The Lottery, you know It's all the Same
Ain't shit Changed just a Big Game
