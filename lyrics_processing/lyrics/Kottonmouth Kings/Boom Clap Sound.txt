When it feel like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down, woah!
Listen deep inside your body
For that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound

Zippity zippity bappity bap
Zip zip zoom
Bap bap boom
Rippity rack, clickity clack
Put one in the hole I'm ready to rap
This how we do when the Kings in the building
That's how we do when the caps start peeling
That's how we do when the barrel goes bam
That's how we do when I'm smokin' on my gram yeah
Tell me what you motherfuckers really wanna do
Wanna run around the track while I run around it too
Wanna run run, get that, split that
Run run run let me hit that, rip that
Hit that, rip that, get that, go
Let me put it in the pipe, let me back it in the bowl
Let me run run run run run run
Like motorbike racer running this show
See Kottonmouth Kings LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like
I never really get upset all the way to the point
Where I feel like there's no holding back now
Try to get a good outlet
Try to reroute
All the things that are weighing me down now
All it seems I need
Is a big bag of weed
And a couple shots of lets say Crown
A few dope beats
And Im taking a Jeep to a mountain top out of town
That's where I go
When I gotta get out so
I dont blow my top off and explode
Cause when I lose control there's not enough time
For me to come back one piece, body whole
I know you know or at least I know you relate
Cause I've heard so many stories told
Gotta take a leap of faith
Put your song on your headphones
And know that your not alone

When it feel like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down, woah!
Listen deep inside your body
For that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound
When the people with the hands and feet dance
Start spinning around
Zoom zoom zoom
Everybody it's time to party
With that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom all day
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom away
Lisen to the sounds of the KMK

I put my stamp on it, gauranteed freshness
The X factor, quality tested
Hand crafted, packed up, and vacuum sealed
So when you bang it loud
It's that shit that you can feel
Real deal, underground street sweepers
Stonetown, we the future sound gate keepers
Kottonmouth, liscensed and bonded
When your speakers need it real
Look who responded
The A-team, special unit stoner squad
Stompin' out these mudholes
Told you it's a dirty job
Clean up crew
So pack another bong hit
Fill it up, to the top
It's gonna be a long trip
Eyes glazed, blood shot, I stay ripped
I disconnect from the system, the power grid
A renegade, outcast, misfit
Well equipped with the cannibis survival kit
When it feel like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down woah!
Listen deep inside your body
For that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound
When the people with the hands and feet dance
Start spinning around
Zoom zoom zoom
Everybody it's time to party
With that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound

Boom clap, boom clap, sound of the Po
Sound of the Po, sound of the Po
I dont know 'bout to lose control
Here they go, whoop whoop
Boom clap, boom clap, sound of the Po
Sound of the Po, sound of the Po
I dont know 'bout to lose contol
Here they go, weoh weoh

Hear that, that be the sound of the police
On their way to ruin your time woah!
Everybody in the area spark it up
So they lose their mind
Boom clap fo shizzy, Im gonna keep these raps busy
Im gonna keep my brain all dizzy
Better get a map when you get a boom clizzy
Clap clap when you hear my gun go BLAP BLAP
That be the level of the party
And bring it so give me the bubble, and snap snap yeah
Now let it all go, we'll move to the beat
Keep givin me the bass, an feelin' the street
In front of the crowd, an boilin' in the heat
An never stop, an never decease, Im off the leash
So give me the keys, you've got to believe me
Open your eyes so now you can see me
Over the lies, Im over the dreamy
Keep lookin' around, Im bangin' the ground
Forever Im peeling
Just give me the track
Im eating your guts and stealing
Similar times resemble the grizzly feeding
Resembling what Im achieving
Related to rap, and call me a heeven
Fuck everybody, Im ending up leaving
The party is over, disgust it ain't stoppin'
Reserve it for good but now it ain't poppin'
An now that I see your true colors I think I'll be droppin'
Outta the race to keep it from floppin'
Keepin' the party alive, the only one option
The only one option is what

When it feel like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down woah!
Listen deep inside your body

Boom clap clap sound
When the people with the hands and feet dance
