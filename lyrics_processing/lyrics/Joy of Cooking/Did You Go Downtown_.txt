Did you take a look around
Buy me some shoes, stockings too brand new
Set of rings to wear, keep a ribbon on my hear
I want to know, did you go to the train?
Hear the bells ring. Did you see my man?
Ask him if he can, ask him if he can
Tell him I can
I want to know, I want to know
I want to know right now
Did you, did you go
And did you say goodbye?
Did you see him cry? I wanna know
I wanna know, I want to know right now
Yeah I want to know , I want to know right now
Come on come on come on
Won't you tell me, I want to know
Should I go? I want to know to do
I want to know to do
Should I go? Should I go too?
Did you, did you go?
Did you, did you, did you go?
Did you, did you, did you go?

Sound of tears through the years
Sound of sadness with the madness
Sound of sorrow, won't you bring me another tomorrow
Sound of a laugh trickling down from a bird

Sound of laughter now following me
Sound of laughter follow me follow me follow me follow me follow me
