Mockingbird, said mockingbird, (2x)
You can hear him sing
Mockingbird, it can do almost anything
I can hear him whistle, I can hear him shout
It can tell you, tell you what it's all about
Mockingbird, you can hear him sing
Mockingbird, you can hear him shout
You can hear him cry
Sometimes in the middle of the night
When you're all alone in the darkness
No-one else around you, for miles and miles
Lonesome and everything is still
Oh yeah, can you hear him, out in the distance
Out in the darkness, I can hear him calling
I can hear him cry, I can hear him calling
You can hear him calling to you
Oh oh, yeah, yeah, said mockingbird, mockingbird
You can hear him whistle, You can hear him shout
You can hear him cry
