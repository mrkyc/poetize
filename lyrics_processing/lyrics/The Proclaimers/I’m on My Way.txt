I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
Ah-hah (Ah-hah), ah-hah (Ah-hah)
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
Ah-hah (Ah-hah), ah-hah (Ah-hah)
I'm on my way to what I want from this world
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
And everything that you receive up yonder
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered

I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
Ah-hah (Ah-hah), ah-hah (Ah-hah), yeah
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I took the road that brought me to your home town
I took the bus to streets that I could walk down
I walked the streets to find the one I'd looked for
I climbed the stair that led me to your front door

And now that I don't want for anything (Ooh)
I'd have Al Jolson sing "I'm sitting on top of the world"

I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can
Ah-hah (Ah-hah), ah-hah (Ah-hah), yeah
I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah
To keep my feet from jumping from the  ground, dear
To keep my heart from jumping through my mouth, dear
To keep the past, the past and not the present
To try and learn when you teach me a lesson

And now that I don't want for anything (Ooh)
I'd have Al Jolson sing "I'm sitting on top of the world"

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
Ah-hah (Ah-hah), ah-hah (Ah-hah), yeah
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on my way to what I want from this world
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
And everything that you receive up yonder
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered
I'm on my way to what I want from this world
And years from now you'll make it to the next world

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
