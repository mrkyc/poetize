I've been so sad
Since you said my accent was bad
He's worn a frown
This Caledonian clown

I'm just gonna have to learn to hesitate
To make sure my words on your Saxon ears don't grate
But I wouldn't know a single word tae say
If I flattened all the vowels and I threw the "R" away

Some days I stand
On your green and pleasant land
How dare I show face
When my diction is such a disgrace?

I'm just gonna have to learn to hesitate
To make sure my words on your Saxon ears don't grate
But I wouldn't know a single word tae say
If I flattened all the vowels and I threw the "R" away

You say that if I wanna get ahead
The language I use should be left for dead
It doesn't please your ear
And though ya tell it like a leg-pull
It seems you're still full of John Bull
You just refuse to hear
You might also like
Oh what can I do
To be understood by you?
Perhaps for some money
I could talk like a bee dripping honey

I'm just gonna have to learn to hesitate
(Yeah!)
To make sure my words on your Saxon ears don't grate
But I wouldn't know a single word tae say
If I flattened all the vowels and I threw the "R" away

You say that if I want to get ahead
The language I use should be left for dead
It doesn't please your ear
And though you tell it like a leg-pull
I think you're still full of John Bull
You just refuse to hear

He's been so sad
'Cause you said his accent was bad
He's worn a frown
This Caledonian clown
I'm just gonna have to learn to hesitate
To make sure my words on your Saxon ears don't grate
But I wouldn't know a single word tae say
If I flattened all the vowels and I threw the "R" away
Flattened all the vowels and I threw the "R" away
