On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
(x3)
I'm not gonna talk about it
(x4)
I'd never been to Ayrshire
Hitched down one Saturday
Sixty miles to Kilmarnock
To see Hibernian play
The day was bright and sunny
But the game I won't relay
And there was no Kilmarnock bunnet
To make me wanna stay
But I'm not gonna talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
No I'm not gonna talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
When I started walking to Wishaw
My eyes obscured my vision
After five miles on my way
I began to learn to listen
(x2)

On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
I've been saying, I've been saying
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
I walked through the country
I walked through the town
I held my head up
And I didn't look down
(x2)
And I'm not gonna talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
Lothian sky, Lothian sky
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
Well, the question doesn't matter
The answer's always "aye"
The best view of all
Is where the land meets the sky
(x2)
I am not gonna talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
Here I go, here I go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
I'd never been to Ayrshire
I hitched down one Saturday
I went sixty miles to Kilmarnock
Just to see Hibernian play
The day was bright and sunny
But the game I won't relay
And there was no Kilmarnock bunnet
To make me stay
I'm not gonna talk about it
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut
I've been saying, I've been saying
