Too long to be vague
When there's something to say
If it's not now, then it's never
So I'll say it straight out
'Cos I have no doubt
No doubt
(Let's get married)
I love you and I want to stay with you
(Let's get married)
Have kids and grow old and grey with you
(Let's get married)
Hold hands, walk in the park
(Let's get married)
Let's get married
We know other people
Who have drifted apart
Who broke each other's hearts
But we ain't other people
So we'll do things our way
We're gonna be okay
Gonna be more than okay
(Let's get married)
We're ready for tying the knot
(Let's get married)
Set the seal on the feelings we've got
(Let's get married)
We can make each other happy or we can make each other blue
Yeah, it's just a piece of paper, but it says, "I love you"

For the days when we can do no wrong
(For the bad times)
For the moments when we think we can't go on
(For the family)
For the lives of the children that we plan
(Let's get married)
Come on, darlin', please take my hand
Oh, and I'll be the one who's by your side
Yeah, and I'll be the one still taking pride
When we're old, if they ask me
"How do you define success?"
Well, I'll say, you need a woman
And you fall in love
And you ask her if she says yes (yes)
Ask her if she says yes (yes!)
(Let's get married)
I love you and I want to stay with you
(Let's get married)
Have kids and grow old and grey with you
(Let's get married)
Hold hands when we walk in the park
(Let's get married)
Alright, you can get a cat, just as long as it barks
(For the good times)
For the days when we can do no wrong
(For the bad times)
For the moments when we think we can't go on
(For the family)
For the lives of the children that we plan
(Let's get married)
Come on darlin', please take my hand
Come on darlin', please take my hand
Come on darlin', please take my hand
