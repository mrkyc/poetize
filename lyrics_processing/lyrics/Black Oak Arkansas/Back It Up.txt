Right up to me
Why don't you try it on for size
Back it up
Right up to me
Never mind the lights
Back it up
Right up to me
Why don't you try it on for size
Back it up
Right up to me
You won't believe your eyes
There's a whole lot of love
Waitin' here for you
You know what kind of love I mean
You've had a dream or two
That burnin' kind of love
That wakes you in the night
Makes you sit straight up and
Cry out with delight
Back it up
Right up to me
You won't believe your eyes
Back it up
Right up to me
You won't believe your eyes
You might also likeSolo
Your heart is burnin' and
Your mind is the wind
Your soul must open
Let the goodness in
You're Mother Nature
And I'm Father Time
So give me some love
I can get behind
Back it up, right up to me
Why don't you try it on for size
Back it up, right up to me
You won't believe your eyes
Back it up, right up to me
I could shout about it feels so good
Back it up, right up to me
In fact I think I wish you would
Back it up, right up to me
I could talk to you so sincere
Back it up, right up to me
Backi it up, right up to me
Back up close to me dear
Back it up, right up to me
I could whisper in your ear
Back it up, right up to me
You have nothin' to fear
Back it up, right up to me
We only have to touch
Back it up, right up to me
Oh, I need you so much
Back it up, right up to me
Why don't you try it on for size
Back it up, right up to me
You won't believe your eyes
Back it up, right up to me
Why don't you try it on for size
Back it up, right up to me
