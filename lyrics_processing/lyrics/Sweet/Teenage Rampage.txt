We want Sweet!
We want Sweet!
All over the land, the kids have finally startin' to get the upper hand
They're out on the streets, they turn on the heat
And soon they could be completely in command
Imagine the sensation of teenage occupation
At thirteen they'll be learning
And at fourteen they'll be burning
But there's something in the air of which we all will be aware
But they don't care! No! No! No! No! So!
Come and join the revolution
Get yourself the constitution
And join the revolution now
And recognise your age, it's a teenage rampage
Turn another page on the teenage rampage now
So recognise your age, it's a teenage rampage
Turn another page on the teenage rampage now, now, now....
They're getting it on, ain't doing it wrong, but they're gonna do it, it won't be long
They've gotta be heard, they've got the word, they really belong
And now they're coming on strong
