My road is long, it lingers on
You stare at me, am I'm holding on?
My eyes are dim, my breath is weak
And tears stain my cheek
Up there so high
Where the air is so thin
You look for signs, am I giving in?
All for me you bring crashing down
And still you condemn me

Oh no, no shame
All my life
I'll not betray
I'll not shed one tear
All my life
Forever more, forever more
Ow!

Sound towers will crumble down (O-o-ow!)
I see everything is broken down
His heart is breaking
Recorded in sound  (O-o-ow!)
We need a miracle joy
We need a miracle boy
A rock 'n' roll toy
A rock 'n' roll joy
A rock 'n' roll boy
