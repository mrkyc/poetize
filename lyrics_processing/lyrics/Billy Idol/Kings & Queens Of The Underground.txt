".. They'll even stop calling you Mr. Broad. People call me Mr. Idol...."
Born in a time that wasn't made to last. In 1977, what it went fast
Johnny told us to rise, not to give a shit
And then "Kiss Me Deadly,"" and we had a hit
Last night in the Roxy we made love on the floor
We shot up in the bathroom and said we were bored
If you are here tonight, and you hear these sounds
We are still kings and queens of the underground
I don't mean to be profound, but if I'm still around
We are still kings and queens of the underground
Oh, yeah
1984, and "Rebel Yell" had the floor
All we said was, "more more more"
Well I touched you with my "Eyes Without A Face""
I was "Hot in the City."" Yes, I thought I was ace
I didn't know then when I was in your front room
On MTV, baby, I was high as the moon
If you are here tonight, and you hear these sounds
We are still kings and queens of the underground
I don't mean to be profound, but if I'm still around
We are still kings and queens of the underground

Sold all my vinyl, it went up my arm
And I thought rock n roll couldn't do me no harm
Now I'm rolling a joint, and I'm dressed in black
If we lose the music, baby, we can never go back
But if you are here tonight, and you hear these sounds
We are still kings and queens of the underground
I don't mean to be profound, but if I'm still around
We are still kings and queens of the underground
Jonesy said, "Bill, don't be profound
If you are still a king of the underground"
If you hear my voice, and you dig these rebel sounds
Still kings and queens of the underground
Here tonight, I wanna dig these sounds
I'm still a king of the underground
If you hear my voice, dig these rebel sounds
Still kings and queens of the underground
Oooh golden years
