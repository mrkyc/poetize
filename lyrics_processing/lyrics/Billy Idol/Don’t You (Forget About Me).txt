Hey, hey, hey, hey
I said ooh, ooh yeah
Ow

Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone dancing, and you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out
Love's strange, so real in the dark
Think of the tender things
That we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
I'll get us back together at heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Will you stand above me?
Look my way and never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down (Down, down)
Would you recognize me?
Call my name or walk on by?
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down (Down, down)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I said ooh, ooh yeah

Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling
We'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Vanity, insecurity
Now, don't you forget about me
I'll be alone dancing, and you know it, baby
Going to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
As you walk on by
Will you walk on by?
Will you walk away?
Come on, call my name
Come on, call my name
Will you call my name?
Yow!
I said (La, la, la, la....)
When you walk on by
Would you call my name?
As you walk on by
Would you call my name?
When you walk on by

When you walk on by

When you walk on by
Oh - Yow!
Would you call my name, name?
