The devil's house in the shape of a chapel
You hid the knife in the core of an apple
Burn me, try to hurt me
Try to hit me when my back was turnin'
I saw you wait where the shadows are growin'
You're talkin' straight, but your colors are showin'
Burn me, try to hurt me
Try to get me when my head was turnin'

You wanna rain on my survival story
You're crazy, baby, 'cause I never had a doubt
I'm singin' songs about love and glory
Oh, oh, oh

Your gun went
Bang, bang, bang
You shot me to the ground
But you can't break me down
Bang, bang, bang
You tried to knock me out
No, you can't break me down

It's just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
I'm the original assassin
I come up for more

You put me up, so you can watch me crumble
I always knew you were some kind of trouble
Lurkin', you can't hurt me
'Cause I see just how your evil's workin'
A silver tongue with the best of intentions
But you're a child with the cruelest inventions
Burnin', you're just hurtin'
I know somewhere deep in hell you're workin'

You wanna rain on my survival story
You're crazy, baby, 'cause I never had a doubt
I'm singin' songs about love and glory
Oh, oh, oh

Your gun went
Bang, bang, bang
You shot me to the ground
But you can't break me down
Bang, bang, bang
You try to knock me out
No, you can't break me down

It's just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
I'm the original assassin
I come up for more
You don't know what you started
You hit but missed the target
You don't know what you started
You hit but missed the target
You don't know what you started
You hit but missed the target
You don't know what you started
You hit but missed the target, yeah

Bang, bang, bang
You shot me to the ground
But you can't break me down
Bang, bang, bang
You tried to knock me out
No, you can't break me down

It's just my natural reaction
When I hit the floor
I'm the original assassin
