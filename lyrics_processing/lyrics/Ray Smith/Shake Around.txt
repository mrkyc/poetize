Well, you gotta shake around little baby
You gotta move little baby
Then you get around little baby
You start slowing down little baby
When the record starts a-groovin'
Let your body start a-moving' shake around

Now the cats will start this too
When they see my baby do the shake around-a
All you chicks who think you're cool
You better learn how to do the shake around-a
When the record starts a-groovin'
Let your body start a-moving' shake around-a
Ooo yeah

When you get a funny feelin'
Like a rockin' and a reelin', shake around-a
When the cats begin to grinnin'
And all the chicks will start a-spinnin', shake around-a
But when the record starts a-groovin'
Let your body start a-moving' shake around-a

Well, you gotta shake around little baby
You gotta move little baby
And you get around little baby
You gotta slow it down little baby
'Cause when the record starts a-groovin'
Let your body start a-moving' shake around-a
Mmm, yeah-yeah, that's right
