Always talk shit but my breath don't stink
Flow been runnin', better rest my sink
Cookin' these niggas, got the recipe
If they mess with me, rest in peace
Got drive like uber, never let the head rest
Mic always on like bald dude with a headset
Hit it 'til she squirt, damn, got the whole bed wet
Rock out like Led Zep
Uh, one take what I do, who you?
Look at your whole crew, I don't know who's who
You look confused, think you need a Blue's Clues
Two girls one cup, you niggas is doo-doo
All about business, I need a new suit
For us, by us, my label is FUBU
Microwave a nigga if he think he too cool
I'm a misfit like I switched to a new school
Upload a pic to the Gram
Your girl with my dick in her hand, gross
You should just stick with the plan
You can sink quick in the sand, woah
I know you a bitch, Mulan
You can get folded, futon
Every girl want the noodle, udon
Goin' hard for the green, cruton
Now I can see why you stress
Now I can see why you stress (Why?)
Your life is just like my lil brothers room
Because that shit is a mess
I know that I am the best
There's something I need to confess (What's that?)
I still use an iPhone 5
But somehow I got success
I be out in Cali in the valley makin' money
Do my dougie cause it's funny
Sip a lot of tea with honey
Make 'em jump like it's a Bungee
Shittin' on 'em, need a Huggie
Flow is cold, I need a Snuggie
Now my pockets gettin' chubby
All these women wanna touch me
Cause I'm cuter than a puppy
And it's like I won the lotto
Cause I'm always gettin' lucky
Now she lickin' my banana
Like a motherfuckin' monkey
And she not havin' my baby
But she feel me in her tummy
Let a nigga breathe
All these sick words in my notes, I think my phone has got a disease
My flow on Mufasa, long live the king
I feel like Muhammad Ali
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Okay, I'm back now
You an ass clown
Whatever that means
You couldn't walk in my shoes
Like you a skinny dude
And I got fat feet
Never been in the backseat
You probably live in a taxi
My flow is oh-so proactive
