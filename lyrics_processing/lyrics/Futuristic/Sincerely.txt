Sincerely...
Shmang, shmang, pow, pow, hide your kids, hide your wife
Saucy Sunday, we raping everybody out here, sheesh

Yo, first of all, that beat is wack as fuck
And I've been busy doing beneficial tracks and stuff
It's not that I thought I was too big for the song
But why would I help some niggas that's hated me all along
Guns drawn when you say my name
That shit is crazy, dang
How you gon' act like I didn't create the AZ lane?
I introduced you to Bootleg, and he said you're gay
Corny as fuck and your band songs are super lame
Y'all got 500 plays in a day
With five rappers on it, goddamn, what a shame
I get that in a minute, before I finish my sentence
So why would I have my people come listen to what you spitting?
You claiming you better, different, let me give the specifics
Three fours of your followers found you 'cause Futuristic
You opened up my sold out show and I told you, "Rip it"
You didn't wanna go first, called me and threw a bitch fit, like
I don't know, bro, there's like a thousand people coming
And I'm only gonna rap for 400 something
Now you out here and you acting like you run it
When the fact is, lil' faggot, couldn't catch it if I punt it
Now let's keep it a hundred, how'd you get on TeamBackPack?
Who did that first? Tell me where your facts at
Your biggest video is smaller than my smallest
11,000 views, I get that on a Snapchat
And isn't my producer admin on your Facebook?
To do your marketing and help you get a great look
And don't you ask my DJ to spin for you now?
He do it for the low and tryna help you out
You really making me proud with the shit you putting out
I mean, it's dope, it just sucks that it ain't getting around
'Cause you ain't left the town, I done like seven tours
Top ten on iTunes and I'm still moving around
I came to Cali to extend the things I started
Then as soon as I left, you lil' bitches started barking
Like now you got the crown and the city on your back
2015 is your year and you still chasing after Zach
Matter fact, didn't you just call me up about a week ago?
Begging to get on a track with me and all my people, bro
Ask me for advice like every night and I would speak it, bro
Other than me, you the only nigga I believed in, bro
I'm eating and you starving in the city though
And who the fuck shoots all your videos?
You lucky I'm not a nigga that's scheming
He's my roomate, I can walk in his fucking room and delete them
Chanita told me that you was talking, I couldn't believe it
I'm happy for you niggas, dream and I hope you achieve it
It would have been cool if that's the way I was treated
But nobody showed me love from the second I started speaking
So I left, got a buzz elsewhere and came back
I ain't never made a post 'bout putting AZ on the map
I let my work do it, I let my fans prove it
And speaking of "Prove It", I included you in that
So it's kinda wack for you to diss me
I know you get emotional, just text me if you miss me
Damn, that's kinda weird, this nigga just text me
Hold on, I'ma read it, it's like
"I don't know if the trolling got to you or not with that verse
But I feel like you more than anyone knows what it is
Didn't mean any disrespect, all for fun and competition"
And I ain't 'bout to say your name, I know you probably wished it
So you can tag yourself if you that desperate for attention
And no, this ain't subliminal, they know just who I'm dissing
