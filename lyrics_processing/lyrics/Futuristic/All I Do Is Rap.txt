Back in '09 I was rhymin', tryna get signed, I ain't know much about it
Fast forward like seven years, I got half a million in my bank, you can count it
Did shit my own way, fuck your label, I done made it without it
They say they could do the same thing, I reply to 'em, "I highly doubt it"
The most underrated, not on the blogs and I'm not in the XXL conversation, I'm really not hatin'
I'm not a freshman, I got that seniority up on their playlist, these rappers remind me of all my white girls that I fuck on tour, basic
Not much hope for the game like presidential candidates that I'm seein' up in these races
I'm rappin' better than ever, I did some tracks with some cats, I was makin' some cheddar
From now on, I ain't doin' no collabs with niggas unless the raps they've writted is similar to my level
I'm Hugh Hefner cause I never get settled, they tryna get under my skin but I never would let 'em
I'm like an ex when you run into 'em at the mall, ask me how I'm doin' and I'll tell you that I never been better
'Bout to go on tour, make a hundred grand, I don't think they understand how I'm livin'
Low key with my whole team, gettin' higher than the nosebleeds in my section
Everybody on my dick now, man, I been goin' hard, I should call the doc
Wasn't supposed to be this hard for this long like I took pills and got an erection
The flow is a blessin', I feel like a substitute teacher, I wrote all my lessons
The flow is ecliptic, they know when I'm reppin', they wanna join in like housewives, they're so desperate
The flow is a weapon, lethal injection, when you speak hate in my direction it be over
Life is a movie, I'm dealin' with trash niggas and I pop like the brave little toaster

All I do is rap, all I do is rap
Slam poet show, all I do is snap
All I do is rap, all I do is rap
Slam poet show, all I do is snap

Don't start a commotion
I could sell out a show with one day of promotion
Why Zach always boastin'?
They know that I'm smooth like skin after lotion
They know I'm devoted
Antarctica bars cuz they know I'm the coldest
You thought you was a boss then I came to your company and then got you demoted
Arizona's Finest
Refer to me as your highness
Y'all niggas switch sounds
One day you Bryson and the next you Desiigner
I'm responsible for the climate
I came in and created a culture
Anybody can catch a body
I'm a wolf and you niggas lookin' like vultures
All I do is rap, you don't wanna scrap
And your girl a thot, got her on my lap
And she like to kick it, really like to kick it not talkin' hacky playin' with my sack
Niggas in the back
Whippin in LA
Cars on the street
Stars in my game
Ice cold you woulda think the winter came, winter came gettin' head on the interstate
In the back of the lift, KFC because I'm baggin ya chick
Ask somebody who they favorite rapper is I would be surprised if Zach isn't it
I got it, I got it
The album is dropping in August
As seen on the internet, dumb shit
Every track I be goin' retarded
All I do is rap, all I do is rap
Slam poet show, all I do is snap
All I do is rap, all I do is rap
