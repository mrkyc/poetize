You ain't never met another nigga like me (sheesh)
Even if I die, you can't forget about me (sheesh)
Everything that I do is OD (sheesh)
I said, you ain't never met a nigga like me, no
My whip is OD, my chick is OD, too much
My fit is so clean, my kicks OD, too much
I spit it OD, my shit is OD, too much
Futuristic OD, I'm 'bout to OD

Yo, I OD like I'm ODB
I ain't passing the rock, you on Kobe's team
Flow cold like your leg in the winter in Illinois
If you walking around with a hole in jeans
I hope to be the nigga that's known as "sheesh"
If it's a par five I'll get a hole in three
Two hands, double fist when I hold my drink
One styrofoam cup'll make you show the lean
It's only me, labels I demand to speak
So don't come at that man if your plan is weak
Instagram going up a thousand fans a week
Don't need a hand, I need some cash you can hand to me
If you ain't with it, you cut off, amputee
Kicking back, taking shots like a damn marine
I'm Dan Marino mixed with Al Pacino at the casino
Cause I'm all about my chips and command the team
Whoa -
See Futuristic LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like
They say I do too much
But I got a lot more coming
She say I'm in too deep
Oh hold on, that ho coming
They say that there's no way
I did it all without no budget
I say I'm way too high
If I ever come down
Imma hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Hit the ground running
Hit the ground running

You ain't never met another nigga like me (sheesh)

Futuristic OD, I'm 'bout to OD

Yeah, uh, shit!
New women in my new phone
Who's home, it's the new number uno
You know, still swerving in a two door
Pimping, if we talking 'bout eyes
I can do this shit with two closed
I'm too OD, bitch, yeah, you know it's D, bitch
The letter after A, B, C, bitch
You know I ain't never been a bird brain
Y'all dudes mermaids, cause I can see, bitch
30K off shirts (that's easy)
Buy merch make merch (that's easy)
Used to cry over bitches swear a motherfucker know his worth
Yeah, I got some homies and the boys did dirt
But I ain't from the streets, I ain't moving that work
But you know I'm dressing like a dealer
Cause I got some money got it coming
Been eating so good that my top's so muffin
It's okay, I ain't fit life, chubby boy got a fit wife and she thick, Christ
I get hyped on this shit right, it's the real me no disguise
Now I don't gotta diss guys I don't care what you're doing
I be here for the money, I be here for the music
It's that Brampton boy and they know the coast
And it's Richvale 'til I overdose
Bitch, I'm gone
You ain't never met another nigga like me (sheesh)
Even if I die, you can't forget about me (sheesh)
Everything that I do is OD (sheesh)
I said, you ain't never met a nigga like me, no
My shit is OD, my bitch is OD
My fit is OD, your shit is '03
No whip, I'm low-key, but I'm still OD
