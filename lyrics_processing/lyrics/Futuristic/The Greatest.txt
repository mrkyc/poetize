Yo, I'm the most underrated, everybody say they spitting fire like a dragon, nigga, watch me come and slay them
Coming from the basement, double XL, man, I want the cover, there's no way that I'm not in the conversation
I don't have no patience unless it's patients from playing operation, I'm castrating anybody that's hating
I ain't tryna be famous, I'm just tryna make payments from what I'm making, I'm frustrated, 'bout to go Super Saiyan
And I'm causing mayhem when I rap, I got a coffin in the back and if you talking then the coffin's where you at
I'm sick, I be coughing on the track, I'm exhausted from the raps, I'm tryna kick it with a broad that's on the map
Shit, make her squirt like the hole that's in the dolphin on his back, I gotta be cautious on the track
And I've been to Boston, been in Austin, been in Compton and then back, where I'm at, it sounded like auction when I snap
Snapback and a backpack, Jean Vest with a fat patch, WTF Gang hashtag
I guess I'll smoke, nigga, pass that, taking shots, duck, nigga, Aflac
Cash stacks, no Kat Stacks, never paying to smash that, if the ass fat then I treat her like a car
I be all in it, might take her on a trip but before I drop it off I gotta wax that
Finders is keepers, I'm all in they speakers, the word getting out
That boy Futuristic been spitting like he chew tobacco all up in his mouth
I don't need a deal, got a whip and a chain and no, I'm not a slave in the south
I got a crib in LA and a crib in AZ, either way I been putting shit down

I'm the motherfucking greatest
I feel like Muhammad Ali, down goes Frazier
I'm the motherfucking greatest
I feel like Jordan in his prime, I feel like Magic Johnson 1980 Lakers
I'm the motherfucking greatest
Rap game Tony Hawk, I been on the roll like a skater
I'm the motherfucking greatest
Used to be a legend in the making, now I'm feeling like the greatest

Yo, I been snapping like a turtle
Dressed like I'm Urkel
They concerned about me going too commercial
Killing shows without rehearsal
If I'm before you, watch the dispersal
They commited to my lyrics, that's a verbal
Copying everything that I do but you paternal
Pissing on them like a urinal
I been popping like a kernel
I cut everyone out the circle
The only one who's in it like a gerbil
You spoiled niggas is looking kinda curdled (sheesh)
Crafted the style, these young rappers is jocking it
Made a brand, everything I wear, they be rocking it
Only difference is, I ain't copying it, I ain't washing it
I'm rocking it then throw it in the moshpit and watch it get crazy
They be boxing and tryna knock them, acknowledge it
These rappers is garbage, they all lacking confidence
Fishing for compliments, Futuristic predicting dominance
Since I was six and I was still out spitting to college kids
Fuck boy, you a bitch nigga
Leave your face Will Smith off of Hitch, nigga
Couldn't resist to write a diss
But when you saw all of my hits
You threw a fit ain't even put it out
Y'all don't make sense, nigga
I make dollars, you make cents, nigga
Get ate like chips and fish sticks, ya bish, that's Kendrick
Hit your bitch like Chris did, coming at my neck
You gon' get removed like a cyst, nigga
I don't got time for no bullshit
I'm working and doing my thing
If a nigga got beef
And decide they should speak
Then I finish his ass like Liu Kang
There really ain't shit you could say
When you ain't getting paid in your lane
I am a created player, I put myself in the game
I'm the motherfucking greatest
I feel like Muhammad Ali, down goes Frazier
I'm the motherfucking greatest
I feel like Jordan in his prime, I feel like Magic Johnson 1980 Lakers
I'm the motherfucking greatest
Rap game Tony Hawk, I been on the roll like a skater
I'm the motherfucking greatest
Used to be a legend in the making, now I'm feeling like the greatest

I been working hard, long days and cold nights
I been traveling, I been up on them flights
I been writing flows, dedicating my life
Lost that love I had, now I'm feeling alright
When my grandma passed I was up on the stage
I said, "goodbye", then I lost my way
Been through it all just to get me here and I'm staying
I was a legend in the making, now I'm feeling like the greatest
Now I'm feeling like the greatest
Now I'm feeling like the greatest
