You got that thang, I don't usually sing, it made me sing, don't it?
Put a ring on it, ring finger on your left hand, throw twenty G's on it
Low key? No we, out in the public eye
Never seen you with another guy
When I met you, you was kinda shy
See you later maybe never or some other time
Cause you got that thang
You got that thang, that make a nigga lose focus
I'm hoping you notice, the way that I'm open
This moment is golden, let's slow it down
I'm frozen, you chosen, the closest, let's roll this and smoke it
And now you outspoken and showing emotions
You touch me, I touch you and now we exploding

I wanna hear you scream like a scary movie
Feel the passion like you married to me
The sacred nobody else could do me
Like you do me, strumming the pain, Fugees
Don't worry 'bout the paper, I make it more than a loose leaf
Have a few sheets, a little pillow talking
I'm the boss, girl, I'm still in office
If a nigga disrespect you then I'm stealing off him
He still at it then I build a coffin, I don't play that
Relationship was Rocky like A$AP, now I need it ASAP
In the day take a great nap
And if you got pregnant I'd tell you, "Keep it"
No plan B, don't even keep it a secret
I'm needing it more than ever and more is better
You should probably move in, I'll give you a couple reasons
I got that thang, I'm on your brain
Now you fallen like the season, damn
See Futuristic LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like
You got that thang
You got that thang, that make a nigga go
"Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn"
You got that thang
You got that thang, that make a nigga go
Oo, oo, oo, baby
You got that thang
You got that thang, that make a nigga go
"Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn"
Yeah, you got that thang and I need that thang
You should bring that thang, hope you on your way
You been on my brain

Yo, you look incredible, delectable and sexually exceptional
I had to let you know the directional, never skeptical
Edible, obsessional, I'm in need of some medical
Put you on the wall like a motherfucking collectable
Respectable, I dig the way that you be so professional
Impeccable and anybody else is unacceptable
Unethical, other women often one dimensional, insensible
I hope you get the principal I'm spitting out
I don't even look at women when they walk past
Okay, maybe I do
Then I compare them to you and they fail so bad
On a scale of one to ten you like a twenty-two
A million things that I wanna do
A lot of promises that I intend to keep
I ain't seen you in a week
You got that thang, I need that thang
So put that thang on the sheets, damn
You got that thang
You got that thang, that make a nigga go
"Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn"
You got that thang
You got that thang, that make a nigga go
Oo, oo, oo, baby
You got that thang
You got that thang, that make a nigga go
"Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn"
Yeah, you got that thang and I need that thang
You should bring that thang, hope you on your way
