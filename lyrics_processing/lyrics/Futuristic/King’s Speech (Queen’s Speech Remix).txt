Always talk shit but my breath don't stink
Flow been running better rest my sink
Cooking these niggas got the recipe
If they mess with me, rest in peace
Gotta drive like Uber, never Let the headrest
Mic always on like a bald dude with a headset
Hit it till she squirt damn got the whole bed wet
Rock Out like Led Zep
Uh, One Take what I do who you?
Look at your whole crew I don't know who's who
You look confused think you need a blues clue
2 girls 1 cup you niggas is doo doo
All about business I need a new suit
4 us by us my label is Fubu
Microwave a nigga ff he think he too cool
I'm a misfit like I switched to a new school!
Upload a pic to the gram
Yo girl wit my dick in her hand (Gross)
You should just stick to the plan
You could sink quick in the sand (Whoa)
I know you a bitch, Mulan
You could get folded, futon
Every girl want the noodle, udon
Going hard for the green, cruton
Now I could see why you stressed
Now I could see why you stressed (Why?)
Yo life is just like my little brother's room because that shit is a mess
I know that I am the best, there's something I need to confess (Whats that?)
I still use an iPhone 5, but somehow I got success
I be out in cali
In the valley
Making money
Do my dougie
Cuz it's funny
Sip a lot of tea
With honey
Make em jump
Like it's a bungie
Shitting on em' need a huggie
Flow is cold
I need a snuggie
Now my pockets
Gettin chubby
All these women wanna touch me
Cuz I'm cuter than a puppy
And It's like I won the lotto
Cuz I'm always gettin lucky
Now she lickin my banana
Like a muthafucking monkey
And she not havin my baby
But she feel me in her tummy!

Let a nigga breathe!
All these sick words in my notes
I think my phone has got a disease
My flow I'm Mufasa
Long live the king!
I feel like Mohammad Ali
Fly like a butterfly
Sting like a bee! (Bzz)
Okay I'm back now
You an ass clown
Whatever that means?
You couldn't walk in my shoes
Like you a skinny dude and I got fat feet
Never been in the backseat
You prolly live in a taxi
My flow is oh-so proactive
And I ain't never had no pimples, Nigga!
