I know they hating on me right now
If I was you I'd hate me too
I know they saying I should calm down
Please, don't tell me what to do
Cause I do whatever I want
I do whatever I want, yeah
I do whatever I want

Yo, how I feel to have a boss and everything you ever did, you only did it cause they told you to
I wake up in the morning, I do anything I wanna do, now that's what you supposed to do
Travel the country, get this money
Sip this liquor, fuck these bitches
Everything you ever hoped to do
I only kick it with a couple niggas
I ain't fucking with you if you lying cause I know the truth
Remember whenever you making that money
Don't ever let that money make you
Cause your new friends gon' hate too
That's why I chill with the same crew
Same dudes, we came through
Same table, same models
We used to have to have to buy them but now they bringing the safe bottle
I'm too faded, I'm too famous, my crew banging, we Wu-Tanging, I'm 2 Chaining, my shoes painted, my boo hanging
Got two thangs that I fuck with
And they boobs fake and they body perfect
Don't ask me for no pictures, nigga, can't you see that I'm working?
