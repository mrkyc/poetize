Ya girl get pulled like skin from a band-aid
Nothing that you say sticks like pam spray
Yeah, I'm sipping vodka with the champagne
Quit tryna block my shine, you are not a lamp shade (no)
I swear to god that I've been on a rampage
Jumping on buildings like that old game rampage (yeah)
And I'm flyer than a damn plane
Ya girl get pulled like a hamstring (ha)
I been clowning lately
Mixing drinks every night, I can down 'em lately
Every town is crazy, I been 'round 'em lately
Yo, happy-ass nigga, no frowning lately
Cheese! Stop for the pictures
Lemme take a sip, gotta stop for the liquor
Homie found a baddie, gotta stop for my nigga
Wait, she's busted, stop it my nigga, yo

I been way too high, you can never bring me down (da da da da da)
I ain't got time for the BS, please don't ever bring that 'round (da da da da)
I think I got the juice, I think I got the juice (do do do do do)
I usually don't dance, but tonight I think I got the moves

I'm just doing my happy dance (da da da da da da da da da da) 
Go best friend, go best friend go
Go best friend, go best friend go
Go best friend, go best friend go

Go best friend, go best friend go
Go best friend, go best friend go
Go best friend, go best friend go
Go, Go, Go, Go
