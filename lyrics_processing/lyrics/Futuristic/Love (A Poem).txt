Love, a poem
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love
No ice love

You make everyday feel like Sunday
You make everyday worth livin'
You give me a purpose to get in, no kiddin'
Your lips is the only ones that I be kissin'
For the rest of my life, don't that sound nice?
Yeah, you make me feel like a baby
Not a care in the world, just laugh and a smile
And as long as you my girl, I might get a violin
Cause you make me feel like I can do anything
Jump the highest, so inspired, don't get tired, stay up with you
Take a day off, lay up with you
We got the rest of our lives, so much to do
I fuck with you, not only fuck with you
Love so strong is it enough to move
Across the country with nothin' but your lunch with you
And I would never do drugs with you
I mean, smoke is cool
But I want you to be addicted to me
You got good taste in music too
I knew that cause you listen to me
Keep me in check if I'm missin' a beat
Love make you skip with your feet
You so sweet, like Halloween candy, trick or treat
I hope you don't change, please stay the same
I mean inside of course
I know that your hair one day'll be gray
I know that your skin ain't gonna be smooth forever
And your hair is gon' drift away
But even when your hand start to shake
I hope that you can still grip my face
Look at me with those same eyes
That can change lives, I've seen it happen
Keep your spirit free and your imagination so far from stagnant
I love when you post pictures of us
With a heart emoji and a caption
And most of all, I love that you're so bad at rappin'
And you can't dance, but you try to
Only when you drink though
You can't hoop for shit
But you sure do look good when you shoot free throws
Hotel room service out the peephole
Pillow talks, yeah, I need those
If we fight, yeah, I'll fuck you, CeeLo
Then I put it in deep though
This type of passion is rare, non-existent
So much more than a friendship
Love that can divide the distance
Make a player decide that he want commitment
Get his pen and write, make millions listen
Turn a pimp to a Christian
Turn a sceptic into a magician
Turn a clean freak to a man and a field of forensic
Stroke me and my ego
I'll massage your insecurities
Make me feel like I'm famous, baby
Even if no one's ever heard of me
Personally, you the only person for me
I'll hold your hand if you in surgery
I can't wait to see our faces in the nursery
I hope you never stop hurtin' me, cause
That would mean I don't care no more
And the feelings ain't there no more
When you change your clothes
Everyday I won't stare no more
Run my fingers through your hair no more
Things we don't share no more
I don't ever want that
I just want you
All you gotta do is tell me you love me too
Love
