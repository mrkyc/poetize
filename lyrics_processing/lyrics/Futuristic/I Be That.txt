I be that nigga who shut down the city
I be that nigga drunk as fuck with all my people with me
I be that nigga with a lot of groupies
Hella famous signing autographs on bitches boobies
I be that (I be that), I be that (I be that)
I be that (I be that), I be that (I be that)
I be that (I be that), I be that (I be that)
I be that (I be that), I be that (I be that)

I'm the only one doing what I'm doing, these rappers is all pursuing, Futuristic really did it
Young nigga with a grind so tough, can't nobody tell me nothing cause I'm in to the finish
Dropping more records than the guiness, got them skittish niggas sick, I need to take them to the clinic
A couple bitches got me looking like I'm winning, at the studio, I tell them that I'm leaving in a minute
I be that, they know how I does it, these hoes hoping they get invited
She text me all day and I don't say a thing, I sent her the address and she getting excited
You can bring friends to the party, they gotta be naughty, my darling is private
Four shots of liqour, enjoying the molly, they all getting naked and showing their privates
I be that, this a sauce man, WTF gang
If you hating, I can make you dissapear like David Blaine
Five bad bitches in my whip, I don't know them by name, I call them Danity Kane
I'm getting young money like a nigga chilling with Wayne, I bring the heat like I'm chilling with Wade, cause I be that

I be that nigga who shut down the city
I be that nigga drunk as fuck with all my people with me
I be that nigga with a lot of groupies
Hella famous signing autographs on bitches boobies
I be that (I be that), I be that (I be that)
I be that (I be that), I be that (I be that)
I be that (I be that), I be that (I be that)
I be that (I be that), I be that (I be that)

Okay, I kinda got it popping, homie, quitting's not an option
And I'm killing all these rappers, pull up yellow tape caution
And these niggas selling out like paintings at an auction
It ain't over 'til the fat lady singing, this the opera
I was born to ball, I know you saw, that a young dude got the juice like oranges, dog
You say you the best but you know you wrong, ain't gotta get Vanilla Ice to have the coldest song
Cole world like J. Cole, y'all bootleg like faygo
My shows look like day glow, I need a chick that move her hips like J-Lo
Sipping 'til I can't stand up, shine so bright I might tan ya
Who's your favorite rapper? They picking me like a teacher, I'm a student who should put they hand up
And I ain't never had a hand out, even when I'm sitting down, boy, I stand out
Feel clean like I washed it with ShamWow, I be that crowd surfing nigga on my fans, ah

I be that nigga who shut down the city
I be that nigga drunk as fuck with all my people with me
I be that nigga with a lot of groupies
