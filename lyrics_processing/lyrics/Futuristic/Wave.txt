Always there to talk (always there to talk)
Every time you call (every time you call)
Always there to catch you (that's right)
Every time you fall (that's true)
Let you be right sometimes
Even when you're wrong (even when you're wrong)
Let you change the station
Even when they play my favorite song (play my favorite song)
Take you out for sushi (yea), I don't even like it (no)
Say you wanna smoke, so I hit the plug, roll up then I light it
If we fightin' and I let you win, I was closed but I let you in
Do it on the sofa, then we rollin' over, do it all again

'Cause you're like a wave, you keep comin' in
Leave a salty taste, all over my skin
You're like a wave, you crash at my feet
Then you disappear, but the view is unique

(And I caught the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(I'm on the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(Yeah, I caught the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave
(I'm on the wave)
I jus' be ridin' the wave, I jus' be ridin' the wave

You nip at my toes, you hot and you cold, you leave me at bay (you leave me at bay)
You back and you forward, you come and you go, you leave and I stay
