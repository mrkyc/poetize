Yeah, yo, my grandmama passed away a month ago
I swear to God that I will never be the same
I don't even know why I'm swearing to God
I don't really believe in all of that bullshit anyways
I'm sorry if you get offended
Back in the day, I used to be the same
I went to church every weekend all by myself
But I kinda feel like the preacher is to blame
He took advantage of my bro
That's a story that no one knows
Shouldn't be told so I keep it to myself
I wanna ask him about it but I just leave it alone
And I don't tell stories for the fuck of it
I do it just to get it off my chest
I don't know how to do anything but rap
I ain't learned shit since the day my dad left
And I cry sometimes when we talk on the phone
He don't know that's a hole that was never filled
A patch on my heart and my brain
I will never be the same
That's a wound that'll never heal
A clubhouse that we never built
Then again, we still got good memories
At least I can thank him for the fact that he went to the clinic to tell my mama not to get rid of me
It was that damn close
So I guess I'm supposed to be alive
So is it strange if I hope that I die?
Hope that I swerve off the road late at night?
Hope that I crash when I'm taking a flight?
Hope that he pulls out a gun if we fight?
I don't give a fuck, nigga, that's all my life
That sound stupid, right?
But that's a thought that I think all the time
I often wish I could rewind
Both my ex-girls got kids
One month away from being mine
It shows how they get over a nigga
Both of them broke and they call me to complain
And both of them cheated
I guess that's why I feel like all women is the same
I cheated on my next girl too
I fucked a whole bunch of girls
But honestly none of them meant shit
I did it just to get over you
Ain't that what we supposed to do?
Come on, I'm a man, I'm a dog
And you so in love with a nigga, you forgive him and act like you ain't see what you saw
I don't smoke that much, it make me paranoid
I don't drink that much, it make me wanna fight
My best friend stole all of my shit
And got away with it like he does every time
I should have beat his ass, right?
But he lied and he said it wasn't him
He even cried and gave me a big hug
So I guess that our whole friendship was pretend
If I'm rambling, turn me off, if you care at all, turn it up
The only thing that I ever wanted was for people to hear my music, put it in the car and bump
Nah, that ain't enough
I wanna be known as the greatest
World famous, still the most hated
Most underrated but most overplayed shit
