Memo finna start actin' out if I don't see him soon
Yeah my best friend ain't backin' out, it's still on sight, fool
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
Trophy case still light, body need a race stripe
And these minerals on my body break light
And these reds on my body brake light
New man comin' up ahead on his own two
Is you a natural blondie like Goku?
Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent
Talkin' heads ripplin' on the surface

Provided diamond lane that didn't exist
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through (Family)
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children
Hand-me-down fits (Yeah)
Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)
Stiff smile just like I'm Aphex Twin (Yeah, come to daddy, yeah)
Pat the Patagonia pockets, tryna find my zip (Uh, where it's at? Yeah)
Blunt twist, tightropes, I'm not fallin' off (Never that, no)
Watch friend's GoPro through fisheye lens, drownin' off clear
I just saw Jaws, divin' under influence
Been feelin' like the Lord's just out of reach for me (For me)
How I feel lettin' man speak
How I feel letting man speak for me (For me)
Holyfield, keep your ears split for me
Can't show my face if you spit for me (Spit for me, yeah)
