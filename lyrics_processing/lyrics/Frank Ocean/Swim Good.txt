That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln Town Car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them (Wow)

And I've got this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

Got some pretty good beats on this 808s CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated (Yeah)
I woulda put tints on my windows, but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby
You might also like
I've had this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral (Wow)
One more mile 'til the road runs out, out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm goin' off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (You broke my heart)
No flares (You broke my heart)
No vest (You drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out

I'm about to drive in the ocean (Drive in the ocean, yeah, yeah)
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me (Bigger than me)
Kick off my shoes (Good)
And swim good, and swim good (Good)
Take off this suit (Take off this suit, ooh, woah)
And swim good, and swim good, good (Yeah, yeah)
Don't die
Don't die
