If you were just another hangover
Baby, I'd already be over you, over you
If you were just a two-for-one
I wouldn't have to face the sober truth, the sober truth
If you were just one in a pack of twelve
I could grab another one off the shelf
I wouldn't be twice, but baby I

I wish you were beer, I wish I was drinking
I wish you were here, But since you ain't, I've been thinking
I wish I could let go, and you just disappear
If you gotta be that cold, if you gotta be that cold
I wish you were beer, I wish you were beer

If you were just a Saturday night
You just be a blurred Sunday morning, Sunday morning
But you're not, you're sticking around
You tangle me up, you're bringing me down
You make it look easy, movin' on fast
You hurt so good, that it hurts so bad

I wish you were beer, I wish I was drinking
I wish you were here, But since you ain't, I've been thinking
I wish I could let go, and you just disappear
If you gotta be that cold, if you gotta be that cold
I wish you were beer, I wish you were beer

Baby I

I wish you were beer, I wish I was drinking
I wish you were here, But since you ain't, I've been thinking
I wish I could let go, and you just disappear
If you gotta be that cold, if you gotta be that cold
I wish you were beer, oh
I wish you were beer
