I'm a dirt road in the headlights
I'm a mama's boy, I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line, kinda cold beer
Little hat down, little John Deere
I kinda give a damn, I kinda don't care
You see that girl standing right there

She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
My turn it up to ten girl
She could have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

She likes my T-shirt, she likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'd take a full moon over them city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I could smooth it out, I could stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough
