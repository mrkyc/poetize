Blue in the sky, sky on the water
Ninety-eight degrees, it's only getting hotter
With her looking like that, two-piece
On a towel in the back
Song on the speakers, speakers turned up loud
So much sun, we ain't ever gonna run out
Can't nobody hate it, nah
I bought a bottle of my favorite (Yessir!)

Tequila on a boat, a boat on a lake
A lake on fire and the tans ain't fake
A girl with a smile, smiling at me
Me with my eyes on her in the heat
Yeah, God's taking care of the weather (Woo)
Life don't get much better
Than ice in a cup, a cup on my lips
Steal another kiss and take another sip
Of tequila on a boat
(Hahahaha, aww yeah, here we go)

Limes in a shaker, shaker full of sea salt
Catching a buzz, but hey it ain't our fault
Blame onto Julio (Julio), hah
Mix it up, baby, here we go (Here we go)
Yeah, time's moving real slow (Yeah)
Drop that anchor down out in the middle (And what?)
And kick back (Hey) and drink a little
