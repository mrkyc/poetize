How'd you know to wear your hair like that?
How'd you know to turn up that song?
How'd you know them little tore up jeans
Was gonna tear me up and turn me on?
Girl, it's like you know me too good
But you barely know me at all
Yeah, the way it's going tonight
You probably know I'm ready to fall 'cause

Baby, you a little mind, baby, you a little mind reader
Yeah, that's what you are
You play it off a little shy but, baby, you're a heart stealer
And right here in this car
It's like you knew that smile was gonna melt me down
Like you know those lips are what I'm needing right now
And, girl, when you lay 'em on mine
Yeah, it's like you're reading my mind

(Baby, you a little mind, baby, you a little mind reader)

Girl, it's like you got a crystal ball
Like you got a little gypsy side
It's like you knew that sweet perfume
That you got on was gonna get me high
Well, how'd you know what I'm thinking right now?
How'd you know what I was about to say?
How'd you know to whisper in my ear
"Let's take this party back to my place"
