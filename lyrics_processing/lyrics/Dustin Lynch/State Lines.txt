Twelve hundred miles, and only three days to go
The speed limit signs, the stars on a desert road, yeah
Can't keep from tryna taste your goodbye kiss, so good
I'd travel to the future for ya, baby if I could
{Chorus}
You know I'll be there, right by your side
If it wasn't for these state lines
Pulling you in, your body on mine
Ain't no way I'd ever take my hands off of you
Dancin', burning up the room
You know that I'll keep on lovin' you, I'll be lovin' you all night
If it wasn't for these state lines
{Verse 2}
Night turns to day, I'm missin' you more and more
I've felt desire, but nothing like this before, no
Blowing up my phone with pictures, such a tease
Girl, I know you know exactly what you're doing to me
{Chorus}
You know I'll be there, right by your side
If it wasn't for these state lines
Pulling you in, your body on mine
Ain't no way I'd ever take my hands off of you
Dancin', burning up the room
You know that I'll keep on lovin' you, I'll be lovin' you all night
If it wasn't for these state lines
If it wasn't for these state lines

Six hundred miles, and only two days to go
{Chorus}
You know I'll be there, right by your side
If it wasn't for these state lines
Pulling you in, your body on mine
Ain't no way I'd ever take my hands off of you
Dancin', burning up the room
You know that I'll keep on lovin' you, I'll be lovin' you all night
If it wasn't for these state lines
If it wasn't for these state lines
If it wasn't for these state lines
