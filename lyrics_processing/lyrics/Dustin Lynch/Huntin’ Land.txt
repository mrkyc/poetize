She's always countin' my beers, then she's cuttin' me off
She don't like none of my friends and she's scared of my dog
She never wants to party with me on the weekend
She's always pickin' fights for no good reason, man
She hates my old lucky boots, always trashin' my truck
Tellin' me what to do, I'm just holdin' my tongue
Man, my buddies didn't understand
'Til I told 'em, "Y'all, her daddy's got huntin' land"

A couple thousand acres up in Kentucky
Little slice of heaven out in God's country
Break her heart, lose the farm
Ain't a part of my twelve-point plan
So I'ma bite the bullet, hold it together
Try to keep her happy, least 'til December
If I ain't in a stand, I'll be holdin' her hand
'Cause her daddy's got huntin' land

As soon as I shook his hand, we were hittin' it off
Lookin' up at the studs hangin' up on his wall
She rolled her eyes, tried to pull me out
But I was a deer in the headlights when he told me about

I probably shoulda cut bait for a hundred reasons
But I gotta make it through one rifle season on that
