Now girl, you ain't a pretty love song
Some kind of Barry Manilow
You're an edgy little rocker, call me up at one o' clock
And say you're sneaking out your bedroom window, here we go!
You're a dixie full of JD, dancing in the Casey's
In your tight tee, yeah
Baby if you were a CD, I'd put you in my boombox leave it on repeat-peat

And girl I got you stuck in my head
Knocking me dead with that little BJO thumping
Wanna get you all up in a truck, fogging it up
Keeping that king cab thumping
All night long
Wanna keep you turned up, baby keep you turned on
Cause you're my party song
I wanna keep you turned up baby keep you turned on
You're my party song

And girl you know you got a Mozart
A work of art kinda kiss
Yeah the kinda automatic gotta have it classic
With the butterfly over the bass remix
You're whatever God came for out there on the dance floor shaking what the good lord gave ya
Making all the girls jealous
Rocking this juke joint jail house just like Elvis
See Dustin Lynch LiveGet tickets as low as $43You might also like
And girl I got you stuck in my head
Knocking me dead with that little BJO thumping
Wanna get you all up in a truck, doin' your stuff
Keeping that king cab thumping
All night long
Wanna keep you turned up baby keep you turned on
Cause you're my party song
I wanna keep you turned up baby keep you turned on
You're my party song

And you're a dixie full of JD
Dancing in the casey's
Baby if you were a CD I'd put you in a boombox leave it on repeat

And girl I got you stuck in my head
Knocking me dead with that little BJO thumping
Wanna get you all up in a truck, fogging it up
Keeping that king cab thumping
All night long
Wanna keep you turned up baby keep you turned on
Cause you're my party song
I wanna keep you turned up baby keep you turned on
I'm talking all night long
Wanna keep you turned up baby keep you turned on
Cause you're my party song
I wanna keep you turned up baby keep you turned on
You're my party song
My party song, my party song
Girl you're my party song
