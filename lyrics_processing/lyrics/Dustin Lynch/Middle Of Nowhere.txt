I don't know which way that you want me to go
Trying to look deep in your blue eyes
Do I lean on in or just leave it alone?
It's like I'm lost in a hundred acre field
No map and I've got no lights
Wondering what kind of friends you wanna be
I'm wishing I could read your mind
Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
Do you want me like I want you?
Or is this just how you treat all the guys?
Are you a little tease or are you into me?
Is this is a game you play, oh, give me a sign
It's like I'm lost in a town I've never been before, just driving around
Girl, you've gotta help me out
Gotta tell me which roads you want me to go down

When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
I'm out here wondering where to go
Doing nothing but it's just a dead end road
So here I go, leaning in, nice and slow
I just gotta know
Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
No, don't leave me in the middle of nowhere
I just wanna kiss you all the time
Girl I wanna go there
Baby, would it be alright
Oh, I'm so lost tonight
