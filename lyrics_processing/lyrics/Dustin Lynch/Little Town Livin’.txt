Hot plate from the Texaco
Cold drink and a can of Skoal
Ain't really know where to go
So we head out to nowhere
Turn left at the laundromat
Call the boys, say, "Where y'all at?"
We're halfway through a six pack
And we'll meet y'all out there

Baby got her feet up like it ain't no thing
I hit the pedal, make the paddle stroke sing and

We're just little town livin'
When the sun goes down, we're gonna ride
Turnin' dirt into dust, yeah, that's the ticket
We're just little town livin' it up tonight

Key on the tree, you know the place
Last one in, don't forget the gate
Field full of Fords and Chevrolets, yeah
My kind of party
A little diesel on a pile of wood
Stir it up, get it burnin' good
She wants to dance like I knew she would
So let's get it started

Wrap your baby in your jacket, hold her real close
Watch the stars fall out of the sky

Walkin' the line and worry about nothin' tonight

Just little town livin'
When the sun goes down, we're gonna ride
Turnin' dirt into dust, yeah, that's the ticket
We're just little town livin' it up

We're just leanin' it back, we're just cruisin' around
We don't smoke it a lot, but if she wants it, I'm down
If she wants to dance, I got my boots on
She got her boots on and it's on, yeah
