Makeup
All on my pillowcase
The morning sun on your face
Drawing lines through the shades
I guess we made up
It's like a hand grenade went off in my damn face
Tryna get it all straight
But baby straight up
I can't recall a thing after everything we drank
But I think I heard you say "why'd we break up?"
And now you're smiling as you wake up

Ooh, baby I ain't ever done cocaine
Ooh, I swear there's something runnin' through my veins
'Cause the way that you move and the things that you do
In my bed got my head all feeling messed up
The taste of your lips and the sway of your hips
Your body on my body, I can't get enough
'Cause your love's a drug and I'm back on it
(I want it)
Your love's a drug and I'm back on it
(I want it)

Lay back
Let's stay in bed all day, let the world just slip away
I got a bottle of champagne, you tryna save that?
Got something to celebrate
Two mimosas on the way if it's like a special occasion
'Cause you came back, you whispering my name
So crazy how you say you wanna stay
Girl I love the way you say that
Here I go I'm 'bout to relapse

The taste of your lips and the sway of your hips
Your body on my body, I can't get enough
'Cause your love's a drug and I'm back on it
(I want it)

Back in your arms, way back in this bed
Going back on everything we ever said

Ooh, baby I ain't ever done cocaine
Ooh, I swear there's something runnin' through my veins
'Cause the way that you move and the things that you do
In my bed got my head all feeling messed up
The taste of your lips and the sway of your hips
Your body on my body, I can't get enough
'Cause your love's a drug and I'm back on it
(I want it)
Your love's a drug and I'm back on it
