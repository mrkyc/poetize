White smoke, needle hittin' red tonight
Black mascara on some angel eyes
Werewolf moon through the windshield risin'
Got the free flags flyin'
Clocked out, cashed in, topped the tank
Snake skin square toes, killin' the game
It's like the wild west out where we're from
So getcha hands up, here we come!

(Whoaaa)
(Whoaaa)
When the sun goes down, we're the small town smokin' gun
(Whoaaa)
(Whoaaa)
Gonna ride back roads til' their ain't no road to run
Gonna tip em' back and drink em' dry
Leave it all out on the field tonite
We ain't gonna stop, ready or not
Cocked and locked yeah, here we come!

Inhale the wind blowin' thru her hair
Universe stops all the time to stare
Find us in an undisclosed location
All across the nation
Here we come!
