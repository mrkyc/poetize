Well, look who it is
Last call I thought I'd get
How's your mama? How you been?
Girl, it's been too long
Saw your sister at the Circle K
Heard baby number two is on the way
Hadn't seen her since her weddin' day
With you on my arm
It's good to hear from you again
Girl, what a coincidence

I was just thinkin' 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars
On a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up right outta the blue
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, I was just thinkin' 'bout you

Hmm, yeah
Hey, I just gotta say I heard your song the other day
And it put a smile on my face when I started reminiscin'
I been on the edge of callin' you
And I'm so glad I decided to

Do what you're doin' right now
'Cause I'm probably thinkin' 'bout you (Oh)
