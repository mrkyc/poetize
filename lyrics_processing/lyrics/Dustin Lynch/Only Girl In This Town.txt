Girl, that sunset settin' ain't settin' on anyone else
Yeah, and we got the barstools and backroads all to ourselves

You make the whole world stop spinnin' on a dime
Yeah, girl, the way you're lookin' tonight

Baby, I
I wanna make you feel like the only girl in this town
Like anywhere we go, there ain't no one around
It's population us on the city limit sign
And if you wanna hit the bars, we ain't gotta wait in line
Whatever the moonlight touches is yours
From neon on Broadway to back in the corn
It's just you and me or out in a crowd
I wanna make you feel like the only girl in this town

(Wanna make you feel like the only girl in this town)

Up from the billboards, the street signs, on up to that water tower tank
Ain't a road I can go down, girl, without seein' your name

And, baby, I
I wanna make you feel like the only girl in this town
Like anywhere we go, there ain't no one around
It's population us on the city limit sign

Whatever the moonlight touches is yours
From neon on Broadway to back in the corn
It's just you and me or out in a crowd
