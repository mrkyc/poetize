I'd be jealous too if she was with you
I'd be out my mind watchin' her move
If I was just the guy with across-the-room view
I'd be jealous too if she was with you, with you

She laughs like she just broke into a hotel pool
She loves deserts and the sunsets out in Malibu
If you felt the way it feels the way she looks at you
I'd be jealous too, I'd be jealous too

She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever-wild smile appeal's like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do

I'd be jealous too if she was with you
I'd be out my mind watchin' her move
If I was just the guy with across-the-room view
I'd be jealous too if she was with you, with you

She comes on stronger than a Bourbon Street Hand Grenade
It's like you know her 'fore you even really know her name
If you could see her in the mornin', sleepin' next to you
Just like I get to, I'd be jealous too

She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever-wild smile appeal's like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do

I'd be jealous, I'd be jealous
I'd be jealous too
I'd be jealous, I'd be jealous
I'd be jealous too

She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever-wild smile appeal's like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do
I'd be jealous too if she was with you
I'd be out my mind watchin' her move
