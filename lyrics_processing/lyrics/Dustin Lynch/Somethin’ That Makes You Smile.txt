Maybe it's drinkin' a glass-bottle Coke
From Petitt's on 5th and Main
Or turnin' a wrench on a soft-top Jeep
On a shade tree, sunny day
You're only here for a little while
Do somethin' that makes you smile

If it's roundin' up beer-drinkin' buddies
To tell stories you always tell
Or a three-dollar ticket under Friday night lights
To see a home team give 'em hell
You're only here for a little while
Do somethin' that makes you smile

Whatever it is, you better get to it
When you got the time, you gotta use it
The road runs out, so take it slow
When them good times roll, man, let 'em roll
You're only here for a little while
So do somethin' that makes you smile

For me, it's callin' in sick to work
And takin' Grandpa's tackle box
Down to that same old fishin' hole
Where he taught me how to tie a knot
I ain't done that in a little while
And that's somethin' that makes me smile

Whatever it is, you better get to it
When you got the time, you gotta use it
The road runs out, so take it slow
When them good times roll, man, let 'em roll
You're only here for a little while
So do somethin' that makes you smile

Those little things
Ain't little things
Those little things
Those are everything

Whatever it is, you better get to it
When you got the time, you gotta use it
The road runs out, so take it slow
When them good times roll, man, let 'em roll
You're only here for a little while
Yeah, you're only here for a little while
So do somethin' that makes you smile

Yeah, yeah
