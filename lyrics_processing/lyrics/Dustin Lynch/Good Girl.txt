I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl

You're an angel, you're a keeper
The kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin'
Every minute since you came around
I was lost in the neon lights
'Til the day that you called me yours, yeah
And they say when you know you know
And I know one thing's for sure

I got it good, girl
'Cause I got myself a good girl
Still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah, you up and took my whole world
And made it so good, girl
Aw, so good, baby, yeah

'Bout 55 years from now
Gonna still be you and me
Watchin' that sun goin' down
I'll still be stealin' your kisses (What else?)
I'll still be holdin' your hand (What else?)
I'll still look at you and I'll pinch myself
Good Lord, I'm a lucky man

I got it good, girl

Still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you
I could take you home to mama
