I see him calling, and you just let it ring
And then you turn your phone over, you keep talking to me
You say he's all excuses and you roll your eyes
But you always let him back in by the end of the night

I ain't tryina' be rude, I ain't even know him
Girl, I'm just looking out for you, the situation that you're in, girl

Now I can't hold this back forever, knowing you'll
Be better off if you just tell him goodbye
Now I ain't tryna get no drama started
But you deserve somebody good enough for you, girl
You need something new, girl
Oh, if you only knew, girl

You can be across town counting the stars in the sky
Or maybe karaoke singing a little Strawberry Wine
But he's got you here waiting, and girl I don't know what for
Yeah, 'cause you're way too pretty, and life's way too short

I ain't tryina' be rude, I ain't even know him, girl
I'm just saying you could use a change in your world
