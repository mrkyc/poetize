Yeah, the music hits when your lips get a hold of me
You know just the way, what to play to keep me hanging on
Your kiss is like a song
Sing it to me 'til the morning sun comes up
Love the sound of your love, turn it up, turn it up
Hitting repeat, girl, I got you stuck in my head
Should get out of this bed, but instead
Go ahead, sing it to me
Sing it to me, girl (all night)
Sing it to me, girl (all right)
Sing it to me, girl
Baby when you start you make my heart beat like an 808
Like it ain't no thing, you pull my strings when you say my name
When your finger tips get to getting round where they belong
Your touch is like a song
Sing it to me 'til the morning sun comes up
Love the sound of your love, turn it up, turn it up
Hitting repeat, girl, I got you stuck in my head
Should get out of this bed, but instead
Go ahead, sing it to me
