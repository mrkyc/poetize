(Kiss you 'bout a thousand times)

I don't know about you
But I need a little getaway
I bet you're feeling it, too
Girl, it's written all over your face
Let's go somewhere where corn grows tall
Down a road that ain't got no name
Let's dust off a bottle on a blanket by the river
Come on, baby, I can't wait

To get you on some red dirt
And get lost in your blue eyes
I wanna see your little sun tan
Lit up in the moonlight
Gonna dance you in the midnight sky
And kiss you 'bout a thousand times
Gotta get you on some red dirt
And get lost in your blue eyes (Woo)

There's something 'bout out there
That's just good for your small town soul
Funny how you seem to care
A little less the further you go
I can see your little t-shirt laying on the bank
You're smiling and sliding in
Body to body, our little party
Water dripping off your skin

Gotta get you on some red dirt
And get lost in your blue eyes
I wanna see your little sun tan
Lit up in the moonlight
Gonna dance you in the midnight sky
And kiss you 'bout a thousand times
Gotta get you on some red dirt
And get lost in your blue eyes

Oh baby, we could leave right now
Let's go, let's ditch this town

Gotta get you on some red dirt
And get lost in your blue eyes
I wanna see your little sun tan
Lit up in the moonlight
Gonna dance you in the midnight sky
And kiss you 'bout a thousand times
Gotta get you on some red dirt
And get lost in your blue eyes
Get you on some red dirt
And get lost in your blue eyes
Come on, baby
