Aw, but I can tell you're dying to
Your lips are singing right along
But you won't let yourself let loose
Cause you ain't fooling me
Come on girl I gotta see
Whoa, baby what you got hiding under that halo?
That little bit of rebel nobody knows
That turn it up, burn it up all night
Wanna do a little something wrong kind of right
Bet you got a little sway hiding in those hips
A little bit of salt in your sweet kiss
Why you holding back, girl, let it go
Baby what you hiding under that halo?
You keep sipping nice and slow
Like you're scared it's gonna go to your head
Baby, I bet you'd love catching a groove and a real good buzz
Having a night you'll never forget
So girl just take my hand
You know you wanna take a chance
Baby what you got hiding under that halo?
That little bit of rebel nobody knows
That turn it up, burn it up all night
Wanna do a little something wrong kind of right
Bet you got a little sway hiding in those hips
A little bit of salt in your sweet kiss
Why you holding back, girl, let it go
Baby what you hiding under that halo?

See what's under that halo
Don't you wanna move, baby?
Don't you wanna dance, maybe?
Don't you wanna get a little crazy?
A little crazy tonight
Whoa, baby what you got hiding under that halo?
That little bit of rebel nobody knows
That turn it up, burn it up all night
Wanna do a little something wrong kind of right
Bet you got a little sway hiding in those hips
A little bit of salt in your sweet kiss
Why you holding back, girl, let it go
Baby what you hiding under that halo?
Baby what you hiding under that halo?
I wanna get you lay low
