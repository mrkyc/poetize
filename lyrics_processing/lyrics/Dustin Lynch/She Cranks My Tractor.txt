She's a wild rose
Waiting on me at the end of the road
Between the water tower and the power lines
We're a cloud of dust
Once I get her buckled in my pickup truck
She's ten pounds of sugar in a five-pound sack
A Hollywood looker in a John Deere cap

I go fast, she hollers, "Faster"
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

Burning the backroads
Sucking jet fuel from the radio
Cows and corn fields flying by
Gate's locked, hop the fence
Sneak past the barn where the riverbank bends
She's the best skinny dipper that you're ever gonna find
She can hit the branch with her bra every time

And I go fast, she hollers, "Faster"
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

She's ten pounds of sugar in a five-pound sack
A long straightaway on a quarter-mile track
She got a kiss that'll hit you like a heart attack
I got the rifle, she's got the rack

And I go fast, she hollers, "Faster"
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
I go fast, she hollers, "Faster"
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
