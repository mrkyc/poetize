Ridin' down, ridin' down
My hand on your seat the whole way round
I carry Band-Aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touchin' the ground
Scared to take them off, but they're so worn down
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first

I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
Wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
And I'll pull them off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
Wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
And I'll pull them off for you

Lettin' go, lettin' go
Tellin' you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Askin' you where you want us to go
You've been ridin' two-wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm askin' to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this comin' off in a cheesy way?
