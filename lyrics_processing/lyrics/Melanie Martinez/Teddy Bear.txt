Stitched you up, put you together
With cotton and feather
Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh, what could I do?

When you started talkin' in your sleep
Saying the things you'd do to me
I didn't care, I wasn't scared
Now I'm findin' knives under the sheets
Crumpled photographs of me
I'm in despair, should I be scared?

Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
(Oh) Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

La, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la
La-ha, la-ha
La, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la
La-ha, la-ha

I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
But now you're back, it's so terrifying
How you paralyze me

Now you're showin' up inside my home
Breathin' deep into the phone
I'm so unprepared, I'm fuckin' scared

Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
(Oh) Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
