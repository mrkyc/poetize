Live a little prouder
We're doing this together, one day at a time
Breath a little deeper
Shine a little brighter
Smile a little bit wider
I know that you might wanna leave
And I know you may not believe me
When I say where there's a will, there's a way
So, don't be sorry
Things will all work out
And I'll always be here when you've got your doubts
Stand a little taller, sing a little louder
Live a little prouder
We're doing this together, one day at a time
Breath a little deeper
Shine a little brighter
Smile a little bit wider
We're doing this together, one day at a time
Everyday this love grows a little bit bigger
Call me the infinity on your finger
Like butterflies in your heart
They just seem to linger
But if you would just listen close
They offer a whisper
You might also likeSo don't be sorry
Things will all work out
And I'll always be here when you've got your doubts
Stand a little taller, sing a little louder
Live a little prouder
We're doing this together, one day at a time
Breath a little deeper
Shine a little brighter
Smile a little bit wider
We're doing this together, one day at a time
What's standing tall
If you won't stand with me
'Cause from up here, everything seems so small
Who would have thought this cage would set you free
Free to fall, if I don't say nothing at all
Stand a little taller, sing a little louder
Live a little prouder
We're doing this together, one day at a time
Breath a little deeper
Shine a little brighter
Smile a little bit wider
We're doing this together one day at a time
Stand a little taller, sing a little louder
Live a little prouder
