Good day
I pretend like I'm ok
Crack a smile
I show my face
Hoping to just float away
I can picture sitting there in a silly chair
Please just take me anywhere
Anywhere but here
Oh wait, too late
Destiny met me half way
It's great when fate cooperates
But I hate how great this citrus tastes
Please don't evaporate
Cause lately my awake feels faker than my dreams
I pray my maker helps me keep up with my fate
Starin' at my face like stage fright
Darin' me to break my brake lights
How could it be wrong if it feels right?
Cause I'm looking at my Lifeline
And I'm ticking while the time flies
Yeah, I'm sipping on the limelight
All I know is that I won't let go
Cause it's my Lifeline
Cause it's my Lifeline
Cause it's my Lifeline
You might also likeStarin' at my face like stage fright
Darin' me to break my brake lights
How could it be wrong if it feels right?
Cause I'm looking at my Lifeline
And then I feel the weight inflate
To aggravate my mental state
I hesitate to compensate
Cause at this rate I'll terminate
Did I underestimate?
Maybe I'll investigate
Or replicate the things that I once knew
I can picture sitting there in a silly chair
Please, just take me anywhere
Anywhere but here
Contemplate about the things that you celebrate
Cause the secret is to change the game
Before it changes you
Sing
Sing
Starin' at my face like stage fright
Darin' me to break my brake lights
How could it be wrong if it feels right?
Cause I'm looking at my Lifeline
And I'm ticking when the time flies
Yeah, I'm sippin' on the limelight
All I know is that I won't let go
Cause it's my Lifeline
Yeaah, it's my Lifeline
All I know is that I won't let go
Cause it's my Lifeline
Blessed with a quest to address my questions
