Where do I begin man
I just lost ten grand
Slim chance you can see a plan
All alone in a new home
Staring at a Tin Man
Staring at a Tin Man
Staring at a Tin Man

My only sight was a knight that night
And despite of his heigh
Something about him looked so right
My only shining the lonely life
I wish I may I wish I might
Ignite the light that scares my fright
And tears the kite that steers me right
Away from the Tin Man
From the Tin Man

There's a reason we've been sleeping for so long
Cause the dreaming feels so good

I live in September for a month or so
And it made me remember where I needed to go, you know?
I was solo feeling so low
30 below oh no I think I'm ready to blow
I'm a Tin Man Peter Pan
Swept away by the cries of neverland
And I don't get scared of lions and tigers and bears
But I get nightmares from a Tin Man
You might also like
There's a reason we've been sleeping for so long
Cause the dreaming feels so good
I believe in why these feelings are so strong
Cause the dreaming feels so good

Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
Cause I don't want to dream anymore
Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
Cause I don't want to dream anymore
Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
Cause I don't want to dream anymore
Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
Cause I don't want to dream anymore
Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
Cause I don't want to dream anymore
Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
(let me open my eyes)
Cause I don't want to dream anymore
(I don't want to dream anymore)
Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
Cause I don't want to dream anymore
Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
Cause I don't want to dream anymore
Wendy won't you let me open my eyes
Cause I don't want to dream
