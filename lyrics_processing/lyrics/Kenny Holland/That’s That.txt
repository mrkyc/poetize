Cause I'll only say this once
I may not be the boy that you had dreamed of
But this is just me
A slave to my heart and keys
But you just use me mistreat and abuse me so easily
Why can't you see
You've got me bent outta shape while you're feeling great
But I think that you made your biggest mistake
You've got me bent outta shape but I'll be okay
Cuz I'm moving on in the worst kind of way
Cuz Imma get, get you back
With my name up in lights that flash
Imma get, get you back
Cuz I'm moving on and baby, thats that
Ain't no museum
And you can't walk through me today
I've said me peace
That leaves nothing else on display
Im only getting older
So just love me while you can
You might also likeMy shoe size is pushing twelve
And my foot steps won't always stand
Why can't you see
You've got me bent outta shape while you're feeling great
But I think that you made your biggest mistake
You've got me bent outta shape but I'll be okay
Cuz I'm moving on in the worst kind of way
Cuz Imma get, get you back
With my name up in lights that flash
Imma get, get you back
Cuz I'm moving on and baby, thats that
Ain't never gonna hold me down
Nothing's gonna keep me around
Got one foot out the door
While you're just half way to the floor
Should've know by now that this day would soon come
HAHA, oh yes, that's right
You're still thinking I'm still young
You've got me bent outta shape while you're feeling great
But I think that you made your biggest mistake
You've got me bent outta shape but I'll be okay
Cuz I'm moving on in the worst kind of way
You've got me bent outta shape while you're feeling great
But I think that you made your biggest mistake
You've got me bent outta shape but I'll be okay
Cuz I'm moving on in the worst kind of way
Cuz Imma get, get you back
With my name up in lights that flash
Imma get, get you back
