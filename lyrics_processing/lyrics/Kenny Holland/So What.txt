In everyone I meet
And everywhere I know, you're the name of every street
Baby, I could be your everything
If only you would just, please, just let me in
You've got me running circles again (circles again)
But I'll run and run til I find the end
(that leads me back to you)
So what, so what
If I'm making my mistakes
So what, so what
I'm just making my own way
Back to you, cuz only you can make me right
Call me crazy, call me baby
Or I'll just lose my mind
But, so what?
Can't seem to stay awake, can't seem to fall asleep
(can't fall asleep)
And even though I hate, being stuck somewhere between
I'll be, Banging this piano, until my fingers bleed
Who knows if you're real though
Cause you feel, so make believe
You might also likeYou've got me running circles again (circles again)
But I'll run and run til I fin the end
(that leads me back to you)
So what, so what
If I'm making my mistakes
So what, so what
I'm just making my own way
Back to you, cuz only you can make me right
Call me crazy, call me baby
Or I'll just lose my mind
But, so what?
Don't leave me hanging on, cause I
Cause I can only be so strong
I swear, I've never felt so alone
Don't tell me you're moving on
Cause I'll fight with the words inside my songs
Feels like this love's turning to stone
I won't stop 'til you come back home
So what, so what
If I'm making my mistakes
So what, so what
So what, so what
If I'm making my mistakes
So what, so what
I'm just making my own way
Back to you, cuz only you can make me right
Call me crazy, call me baby
Or I'll just lose my mind
But, so what?
