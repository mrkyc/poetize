There I lay upon the ground
I look around life feels like a merry-go-round
I can't hear a sound because everything is too loud
Mocked by a crowd of clowns and their newfound frowns
My heart just pounds and pounds and pounds
I'm a walking life size lost and found
Then I heard a siren song
And she said 'Do you wanna right your wrongs?'
Oh dear it's clear that I'm her volunteer
So she led me to a room with mirrors
And I saw each and every single one of my fears appear
As the whole crowd cheered

Welcome to Dreamville
The place where nothing's as it seems
And I'll be the death of you
Just chase your wildest dreams
Beware of all the smiling faces that you see
The candy corn and everything in between

I can try and be honest
But I can't try to be cool
I've broken every promise
Re-wrote every rule
They got me trapped on a corner
They got me playin' a fool
Run (x 8)
Run away with me
Cause you're always being chased
When you were always chasing dreams
Yeah, we all feel like werewolves
Way beware all the faces of perril
Plenty of horsepower from all of the payroll
It's different than it looks
You might also like
So please be careful
Please be careful (x3)

Welcome to Dreamville
The place where nothing's as it seems
And I'll be the death of you
Just chase your wildest dreams
Beware of all the smiling faces that you see
The candy corn and everything in between

Let's make the world sing
Please be careful (x6)

Come to Dreamville
The place where nothing's as it seems
And I'll be the death of you
Just chase your wildest dreams
Beware of all the smiling faces that you see
The candy corn and everything in between

I'm a self-made masquerade
Not afraid to parade on the games played
And you may decay
From the way that she took your hand just to betray
But who's to say that I shouldn't say
Come to Dreamville
The place where nothing's as it seems
And I'll be the death of you
Just chase your wildest dreams
Beware of all the smiling faces that you see
