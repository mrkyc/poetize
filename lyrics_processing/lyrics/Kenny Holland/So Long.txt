Went home through kaleidoscope
And all I see is all I know
So I will throw, or even row
To save my fellow cast away souls
Take my out reached hand
Understand how quick
The sand can twist the plan
And trick a man
Give you ground
To stand if you let it

I remember a melody
Swimming inside of me
I can picture a memory
Feeling so meant to be

Take me away to an island
Where the colour's silver lining
And the sun is always shining so low
I've been sleep walking on the water so long
So long
So long
You might also like
Hate how everyone acts
Like everything is so perfect
Sure its worth it
But its definitely not the picture perfect
Circus the way everyone heard it
We all cast out the same
Before go the blame
We hide the pain
Like a self-serving surgeon
On a lost excursion
Searching to find his perfect version
And I hate how everyone acts so concerned
And nervous with another person's purpose
We all deserve this curse of a curt
Just swim through it all alone yeah

I remember a melody
Swimming inside of me
I can picture a memory
Feeling so meant to be
1, 2, 3, 4

Take me away to an island
Where the colour's silver lining
And the sun is always shining so low
I've been sleep walking on the water so long
So long
So long, long, long, long
So long, long, long

Take me away to an island
Where the colour's silver lining
And the sun is always shining so low
I've been sleep walking on the water so long
So long

I'll find a plane and be the pilot
We can find a private island
Parachute to paradise to land
And I've been sleep walking on the water, so long
So long
So long
So long
