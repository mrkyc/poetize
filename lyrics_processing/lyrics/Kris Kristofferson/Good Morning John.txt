Ain't it great to see your future shining brighter in the naked light of day?
Ain't it great to see your future shining brighter than the naked light of day?
You made it, son!
But I confess there was a time or two I thought that you might let it slip away
I love you, John!
In the cold and holy darkness you were always shining brighter than a star
God bless you, John!
For the love and joy you've given and the living inspiration that you are
You've scared me, John!
Cause you crossed so many borders into danger with a price upon your head
They got you, John!
And it hurts to see so many friends, who ran along beside you lying dead
I know you, John!
There ain't nothing you can't handle now, cause there ain't nothing bigger than your heart
There ain't nothing you can't handle out there ain't nothing bigger than your heart
Keep shining, John!
Keep smiling, John!
For you owe it to the others and the dark and holy wonder that you are
You might also likeHang in there, John!
It's a rocky role to glory, but the strangest and strongest will survive
Keep smiling, John!
We'll both make it there tomorrow but today lets say we're lucky we're alive
We won't make it there tomorrow, but today let's say we're lucky we're alive
I'll see you John!
Though the best of good intentions have a way of gettin' scattered by the wind
I know you, John!
There ain't nothing you can't handle now, cause there ain't nothing bigger than your heart
I'm leavin' John!
You can lose your mind and mem'ry but you ain't gonna lose me as your friend
I love you, John
You can lose your mind or memory, but you'll never lose me as your friend
Good morning, John!
