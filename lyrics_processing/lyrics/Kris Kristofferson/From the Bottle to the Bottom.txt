That's good as any joke I've heard
It seems since I've seen you last
I done forgot the meanin' of the words
If happiness is empty rooms
And drinkin' in the afternoon
Well I suppose I'm happy as a clown
But if it's got a thing to do
With smilin' of forgettin' you
Well I don't guess that I could say I am
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew
When the water from the weeds it soaked the papers
He been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from coming through
And his future feels as empty as the pockets in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come true
That's the way that I've been feeling since the day I started falling
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learning hard to live with losin' you
You wonder if I'm better off
With freedom now to do the things I choose
With all my times my own and
I got nothing left but sleeping time to lose
There's no one here to carry on
If I stay out the whole night long
Or give a tankerous damn if I don't call
I'm living like I wanted to
And doing things I wanna do
And nothing means a thing to me at all

And his future feels as empty as the pockets in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come true
That's the way that I've been feeling since the day I started falling
