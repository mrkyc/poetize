I walk in the room in checking my lines
Because you always look for problems to find
But it's not your fault because this is how you design
Baby you can't be content when you know everything's fine
And you say I don't support you in your time of need
I can't support you if you always take it out on me
Baby you want me just to love you while you're hounding me
You always tell me breathe easy while you're drowning me
I try, I try to keep you right, but girl, you're far too gone
You say the same things all the time and it's just been too long
I understand your feelings, I get why you're mad
I understand your problems and why it's all bad
I get why you're screaming a hole through my head
And afterwards you want to cuddle up in the bed

Because you're crazy!
And you're stupid!
And you're psycho!
You make me sick, sick, sick, sick, sick!

So what do you do when love turns away
You never make up and fight every day
She's throwing a fit because she can't have it her way
And she wants to treat you real bad but also wants you to stay
And I just can't get down with that girl you must not know me
Can't listen to the sound of that there's nothing left to show me
I am over you and all your crap uh uh oh
Your love has turned into a trap uh oh
I understand your feelings, I get why you sad
I understand you're leaving and packing your bag
The thing you don't get is I don't care anymore
I already threw half your shit up out of my door
You might also like
Because you're crazy!
And you're stupid!
And you're psycho!
You make me sick, sick, sick, sick, sick!
