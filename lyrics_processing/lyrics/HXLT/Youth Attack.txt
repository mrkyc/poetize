What is my culture, what is my power, what is yours, what is ours? How can you teach me if you can't reach me with your call?
I got a fire and I got direction, let me heal you with my infection
The power injection, the power injection
Let me heal you with my direction, fuck what they sellin' us
They always tellin' us we can be anything we want
But they never allow it all unless their down to fall into the prey in for which to hunt
But we can see past it all we can see into you in your reaching and in your fall
But you gotta decision you can lay in the system or we can wake up and we can have it all

'Cause I am falling madly for the freedom of it all
If it's easy then it's wrong
Make your new laws and we'll see your flaws

They don't know you they tryna learn you
Look at our system look what it's turned too
It's all fuckin bullshit 'cause they can't tell me what I know
They say follow the lifestyle
Everyone follows the same thing today the same thing tomorrow All for safety change is crazy
Don't make me change things from how they go

You can't make rock n roll and say nigga, nigga, please
You can't like what you like and be who you are with me

And until you learned you were different by the ones you thought were the same
You get over it, fix your heart
Fight that label and make your name
So state your facts but don't be too proud
They kill the ones who speak too loud
They cage the ones that would reach a crowd
I fought it all and I'm reaching now in a
