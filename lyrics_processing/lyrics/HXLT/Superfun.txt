Under the street lights where the freaks come out to play
I wanna party and I'm gonna have my way
No, I don't care when, I know it's going down today
My way
I got my drink, it's almost gone
I'm so damn turnt off 2Chainz's song
This girl is standing on the wall
Not moving at all
And she says "I don't know it's weird to me
To sing the same old songs and do the same old things"
And I say "I'm kinda drunk but I think that we should just get live as fuck anywhere we can be, and have fun"
Fun, fun, fun, fun
And have fun
Fun, fun, fun
You got a 50 in your pocket, put your hands up
You like titties in your face then get your hands up
You got cities in the place then put your hands up
You gonna slap a nigga silly then put your hands up
Make some noise if you know you're feeling alright
You gotta 
If you're 
Grab a drink, we gon' do this shit all night
You might also likePass this bottle all around and fill the glasses up until they drown
Girls move those asses, take them to the ground
I'll tell the bartender to bring another round for my friends
The haters keep on hating cause they don't get their way
But they can keep on talking, I don't hear what they say
The hipsters  and think they know it all
Wearing them broke ass flannels because they never ball
I don't know, it's clear to me
That you have way more fun places you should not be
And I say "You can knock it easily and act like you're too cool but I just think we should have fun
Fun, fun, fun, fun
And have fun
Fun, fun, fun
And have fun
Fun, fun, fun, fun
And have fun
