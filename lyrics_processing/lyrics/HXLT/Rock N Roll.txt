I I want to rock n roll your face off
I I want to rock n roll your face off
I want to make you fall in love and I'll do whatever it takes oh
Your power struck me from above that's not a feeling I can shake off

I want to get into a fight in front of you and knock his lights out
I want to ride a motorbike make you jump on it and we ride out
I want to jump up on the stage and sing a song that makes your heart melt
I want to whisper in your ear and say the perfect thing that's heartfelt
I know I got these crazy feelings and I want you to feel them with me
I want to kiss you in the crowd and I might do it if you take me
Man I'll do whatever it takes, I need to find out what you fall for I want to turn your head around and I'll do whatever is called for, cuz...

I I want to rock n roll your face off
I I want to rock n roll your face off
I want to make you fall in love and I'll do whatever it takes oh
Your power stroke me from above that's not a feeling I can shake off

You you got me feeling high as ever
Girl when I get around you I start to do things I would never
I start to think that you're my muse because you get me so inspired
We can do whatever we choose and live our lives right on the wire
I need you to be right by my side
Cuz girl without you I just can't decide
While I'm writing this song can't think of none at all
Till I look at your face and the words just fall, cuz...

I I want to rock n roll your face off
I want to make you fall in love and I'll do whatever it takes oh
