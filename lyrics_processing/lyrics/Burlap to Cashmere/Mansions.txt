God of Light, light me some passion
Green fields and lovely mansions
Let your mansions live inside me
Love me, light me, give me, guide me

Cross of skin and naked figure
Broken legs and crooked fingers
Help me live for good tomorrow
Today's too late and full of sorrow

This light is good and dark is evil
But I'm running around
Through the cross and through the steeples
Trying to make it to higher ground
Come on light, please live beside me
Love me, light me, give me, guide me

No pride and hate, they live inside me
I need your love enough to guide me
Help me walk across these borders
I'm a pilgrim in deep waters
You might also like
Faithful God, like faithful sunrise
Help me break from all these old ties
Lead me all to that is holy
Break these chains, but break them slowly


God of Light, light me some passion
Green fields and lovely mansions
Let your mansions live inside me
Love me, light me, give me, guide me
Let your mansions live beside me
Love me, light me, give me, guide me
Love me, light me, give me, guide me
