She was driving through the night, through that fortune road of fame
She was looking for the man just to powder up the pain
And the power of the Sun never caught her weary sand
She was looking for the man with the gun in the hat
Drinking whiskey in the rain and the Bible in his hand

Shake the light, drown the sun
Close the shades, lock the door
Burn the pages of your life as your body hits the floor
And as you weep, you can hear it
There's an echo of a call
And through the violent, bloody night
Nehemiah builds the wall

I was living off the land, trying to get the job done
I was looking for the souls that were burning in the sun
She was burning up the crowd and was landing on time
I said, "Crooked is the man who reveals in a verse"
There a prophet of the land, when there's poison in your mind

Shake the light, drown the sun
Close the shades, lock the door
Burn the pages of your life as your body hits the floor
And as you weep, you can hear it
There's an echo of a call
And through the violent, bloody night
Nehemiah builds a wall
You might also like
Yesterday's gone
Tomorrow an illusion
Infinity

I am fire, I am gold
I am river, I am sea
I'm eternally the sound
That is screaming to be free

Shake the light, drown the sun
Close the shades, lock the door
Burn the pages of your life as your body hits the floor
And as you weep, you can hear it
There's an echo of a call
And through the violent, bloody night
Nehemiah builds the wall
Shake the light, drown the sun
Close the shades, lock the door
Burn the pages of your life as your body hits the floor
And as you weep, you can hear it
There's an echo of a call
And through the violent, bloody night
