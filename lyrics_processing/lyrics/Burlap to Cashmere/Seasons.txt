Seasons come and go, fade until tomorrow
Seasons come and go
And leave that smile away, leave that smile away
You can come around, but never stay

Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Wheels don't work, car won't drive
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
One naked man, one naked scheme
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody glide
Glide along and wave goodbye

Seasons come and go, fade until tomorrow
Seasons come and go
Through the hills and valleys someone calls my name
Opens up the sky, takes me off my train

Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Wheels don't work, car won't drive
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
One naked man, one naked scheme
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody glide
Glide along and wave goodbye
You might also like
Through the hills and valleys someone calls my name
Opens up the sky, takes me off my train

Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Wheels don't work, car won't drive
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
One naked man, one naked scheme
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody glide
Glide along and wave goodbye

Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
Everybody look, everybody seem
Faded into a bad, bad dream
