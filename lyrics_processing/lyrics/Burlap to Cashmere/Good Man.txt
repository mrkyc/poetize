He was walking down the highway
And you saw him straggling along
And you reached out, opened up your door
And you gave him a ride to your heavenly home
God his mother, she don't listen
And his father hated his old man
But you listened to his feelings
And your eyes consistantly understand
Yes, your eyes consistantly understand

He was a good man, he lived a good life
He was a good man, he lived a good life
But he was dancing to the bright lights
He was dying for some love

Well, you see him with his guitar
Down the highway, he would walk along
Singin' old songs, singin' Sunday blues
But his school bells were his only song
Yes, his school bells were his only song
Through the fire, through the lying sun
Through the smoke and fog, through a day that's done
There was strength there, there was hope alive
There was strings of peace from the other side
There was strings of peace from the other side
You might also like
He was a good man, he lived a good life
He was a good man, he lived a good life
But he was dancing to the bright lights
He was dying for some love

Don't you see he's falling away
Thank God for the love that you gave
Only love can put out a fire
And only love was calling him higher and higher

He was a good man, he lived a good life
He was a good man, he lived a good life
But he was dancing to the bright lights
He was dying for some love
He was a good man, he lived a good life
He was a good man, he lived a good life
And you were right there, for the hard times
You were right there again and again
Again and again
Again and again

He was walking down the highway
Give him a ride to your heavenly home
Give him a ride to your heavenly home
