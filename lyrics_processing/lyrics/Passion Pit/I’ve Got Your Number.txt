Everyone that I've met has been somewhat mistreated
That's how it feels when you know that something's wrong
Then you came along like a swan off of the lake
You flew across my eyes and out into space
And I ran and I crawled and I chased to get a taste
That's what I did
If there's just one thing you got to remember
Is to write down your name and your phone number
That way I'll have it and we'll make something out of this mess
And if all else fails then the ship won't set sail
God forbid but I guess the both of us will bail
But as far as I can tell, I think things will be swell
Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster
Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at

With our premonitions out in the gutter
Who would have thought that I'd make it this far?
I'll make it seem like I'm stronger but I'm quite the actor
And now I'm so caught up and I can't escape this pattern
But when I started losing hope, there you were, there you bloomed
Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster
Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at
Diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, boom, boom
Diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, boom, boom
Diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, boom, boom
Diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, boom, boom
Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster
Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at
