Well he called the whole thing such a wild mistake
He said he didn't mean no harm
Well it was a big to-do (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
But nothing else was new (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
His past checkered like checkerboards in Central Park
You do good in the light and the bad in the dark
Good men are scarce and few (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
They're always passing through (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh, you mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
They're all I see
Oh, let me be
You mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
Oh, mirrored sea
Leave me be

Born with a chance that everybody takes
With all risk and hardly any reward
Bounce off the walls of your teens (Eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh)
Like in a pinball machine (Eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh)
Slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life
Like overheard insults or a cheating wife
And then it's down for the count (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah)
The lost that won't be found (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah)

Oh, you mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
They're all I see
Oh, let me be
You mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
Oh, mirrored sea
Leave me be

Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone
Everyone's alone, everyone's alone, everyone

Oh, you mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
They're all I see
Oh, let me be
You mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
Oh, mirrored sea
