Come to me honey and feel the warmth around you grow
Calls from above me, echoes down below
We've resorted to the undertow
I try, but what you're feeling is the undertow, tow
How can you ever  so high
Well surely you have wondered why
Waves still crashing, tides of love
Running all our hope, hope
And they crash upon the shores 'til we know

We know what we need, clear and immediately
A love concrete, spelling it out on the street
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see, my darling
We know what we need, clear and immediately
A love concrete, spelling it out on the street
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see, my darling

Shot down from under what we never should be
Close to your body, I am taking your lead
But maybe it's the undertow
But I lie, I'll just tell them it's the undertow
Off to a little bit of what could've been a bit of love burning feverishly
Skip through the thick of it and watch as I fill up with the forces that take over me
Oh, take me away from all this foolish grief, baby
Wake me once you know our home and that's where we'll stay
You might also like
We know what we need, clear and immediately
A love concrete, spelling it out on the street
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see, my darling
We know what we need, clear and immediately
A love concrete, spelling it out on the street
Love until you bleed
Love until, love until you bleed and see
Love until you bleed
