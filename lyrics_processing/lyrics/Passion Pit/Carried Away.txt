Since my heart is golden, I've got sense to hold in
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No, I'm not as proper, my money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street

Listen, I'm your friend, don't quote me, but not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts? Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favorite little scene, oh, oh, oh

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about things that I said
Always let it get to my head

Oh, a European, once again with feeling
Higher education, making sense
Justify your thesis, certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense
You might also like
Listen, I don't really know you and I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can
And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oh, oh, oh

I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head

Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to
'Cause no one's really watching
Well, she'll have something to say about it
But we all have problems
We're all having problems
And we've all got something to say
I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about things that I said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
