Sorry I couldn't be there
I was tied to a rocking chair
I was beat down to a pulp
Rocking back and forth somewhere
If you knew, if you saw
You'd have said it was the final straw
There my life was bound and tethered
On a porch by the shore

But there is no, no, no, no, no
Easy way to tell one so
The things you know
And run, run, run, run, run
When they say they think they know
Exactly so

It's not right, it's not right
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we? Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers
We don't stand a chance
So long as they're around
You're just another song and dance
It's not fair (It's not fair), it's not fair (It's not fair)
Still I'm the only one who seems to care
You might also like
It's funny being funny
Makes you feel like up and running
When your past lingers like rain clouds
Casting shadows below
I could live with so many burdens
I'll take all your hope and yearning
But there's no way I won't take me
For their petty little woes
I used to glow, glow, glow, glow, glow
Once I had a love to show
A love they know
But they're slow, slow, slow, slow, slow
So slow that they never know
Where I go

It's not right, it's not right
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we? Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers
We don't stand a chance
So long as they're around
You're just another song and dance
It's not fair (It's not fair), it's not fair (It's not fair)
Still I'm the only one who seems to care
I know that it's always something
I'm just working with what I've been given
It's not my fault, I'm happy
Don't call me crazy, I'm happy

It's not right, it's not right
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we? Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers
We don't stand a chance
So long as they're around
You're just another song and dance
It's not fair (It's not fair), it's not fair (It's not fair)
