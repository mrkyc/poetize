Out on my own, where I found you alone
You were caught up in somebody else's mess
And yes, I drank all those drinks on my own
My life's become some blurry little quest
And the clock kept ticking slowly
And you leaned over to ask me
If I even had a clue where I was
Well I lied down on your wood floors
And my brain and body took course
And the night ended as though it never was

It all began to feel insane
I wanna know where they keep the rain

Sylvia, right back where you came from
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb, but
Sylvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough is enough

Sick to the bone on the steps to my home
The moon shined through the drapery of leaves
Too hurt to ignore everyone of my own
My true love just to feel some made-up breeze
But as my body crumbled, you walked as I just stumbled
And we spoke only of things made in my head
You never once controlled me, while all the others told me
That if I kept on going, I'd be dead
You might also like
It's not just you who fed the pain
Now tell me where they keep the rain

Sylvia, right back where you came from
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb, but
Sylvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough's always too tough

See what I've done now, I don't understand
She says I screamed and that I raised my hand, but
I never meant to, wasn't even there
I never meant to, I would never dare

Sylvia, right back where you came from
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb, but
Sylvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough's always too tough
Sylvia, right back where you came from
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb, but
Sylvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
