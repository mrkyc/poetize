So many die in the night
When I was thinkin' we're over and done for
When I was feeling no life
You put your hand on my shoulder and told me
It's gonna be alright
(One day) one day
(It's gonna be) it's gonna be
(Alright) alright
(Alright) alright
(One day) one day
(It's gonna be) it's gonna be
(Alright) alright
(Alright)
One day (one day)
Oh yeah (I do believe)
I do believe (it's gonna be)
It's gonna be (alright)
When I was running and still going no where
And steady losing my seat
When I was crawling along on the way side
I saw the dead in the street
You put your hand on my shoulder
And told me, do what you do and believe
You might also like(One day) one day
(It's gonna be) it's gonna be
(Alright) alright
(Alright) alright
(One day) one day

Alright, alright, alright, hey
Gonna have a good time tonight ya'll, yeah, yeah

And when you think that you'll never get over
And there ain't nothing you got
When all you feel is the pain and the suffering
And you wish it would stop
And in your heart and the soul, you are broken
And you want to give up, I heard you say
(One day) one day
(It's gonna be) it's gonna be
(Alright) alright
