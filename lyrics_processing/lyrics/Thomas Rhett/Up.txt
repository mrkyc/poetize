You'll never walk on the ceiling
If you never been flat on the floor
And you can't soak up the sun
If you never been stuck in the storm
You can't find somebody
If you never let somebody else go
If you ain't hit a wall, you'll never find a window

You can never go up
If you never been down, down, down
If you never been lost
You won't ever get found, found, found
I remember what my mama told me
Ain't nobody in love who ain't never been lonely
You can never go up
If you never been down, down, down

La, ah
Ooh

You can't hear the angels singing
If you never played the devil a song (Whoa)
And you don't know what it's like to come back
If you never been gone
Yeah, you can't appreciate money
If you ain't been so broke, it ain't funny
We're all kids on a playground, sittin' on a seesaw
