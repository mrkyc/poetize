You're my forever, my slice of heaven
On this side of the Mississippi River, baby
You're my infinity, no end to you and me
Come hellfire or rain, baby, nothin' can change it
No, nothin' can change it

Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me

You're my destiny, you'll always be with me
Today, tomorrow, all the way to eternity, baby (Baby)
No last breath taken on this Earth
No concrete tombstone, no amount of dirt can change it
No, nothin' can change it

Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me
