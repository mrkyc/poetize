Walkin' down the street, hand in mine
It don't keep them other guys
And their wanderin' eyes from lookin' at you
But it's alright and that's okay
Who could blame 'em anyway?
You're so pretty and you ain't even got a clue

'Cause everywhere we go, girl, you're the star of the show
And everybody's wonderin' and wantin' to know
What's your name? Who's that girl with the prettiest smile in the world?
Girl, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are the star of the show
You're the star of the show, baby, yeah, yeah

Friday night on the town
We walk in and you draw a crowd
Even the band seems to sing for you
Ease on up and order a drink
Barkeep says, "It's all on me"
You look at me and laugh like you don't know what to do
Baby, you're so cute

'Cause everywhere we go, girl, you're the star of the show (Star of the show)
And everybody's wonderin' and wantin' to know (They want to know)
What's your name? Who's that girl with the prettiest smile in the world?
Girl, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are the star of the show (Ooh)
You're the star of the show, baby, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
