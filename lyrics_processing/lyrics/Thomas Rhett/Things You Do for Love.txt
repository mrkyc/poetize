You'd move a mountain, move to New York
To a run down apartment you can barely afford
Ditch all of your plans to follow her dream
Knowing it might work out or fall apart at the seams

You just wanna see her smile
You just wanna see her happy
Just wanna make her happy

Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
It's crazy

She'll buy you tickets, see a band she don't like
She'll watch you go crazy, she'll be beside you, rocking all night
She'll say you look handsome in that suit that don't fit
She'll laugh at a joke that both of you know she don't even get

She just wants to see you smile
She just wants to see you happy
She just wants to make you happy, yeah

Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
Give your last breath, give your last name
Your umbrella in the pouring rain
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
It's crazy

Well, she'll keep you grounded
And she'll make you fly
And she'll forgive you
Even though she already has a thousand times

Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
Things you do for love (Things you do for love)
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love, things you do for love
