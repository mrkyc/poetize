Does your heart skip a beat when he kisses you, baby?
Yeah, I just gotta know for my peace of mind
Staying up all night 'cause it's driving me crazy
Tell me yes or no, either way I'm fine

Last time we talked, said you've never been better
That's what you said though when we were together
Mine in July, but you're his in December

I guess I was your gateway love
I didn't get you high enough
Kinda like an eighth grade crush
That never lasts
Are you on that heavy stuff?
Tell me, did you find the one?
Find the one I thought I was
But now I know that I was just
Your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby

Was I just one piece of the puzzle you're playing?
Did you have your eye on a different prize?
Was I just another number on a whole other waitlist?
I knew it had to end, but it was sublime
