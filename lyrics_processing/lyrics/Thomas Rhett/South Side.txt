Please commence shaking your south side
Thomas on that beat
Yeah
It feels good

Ain't no place it ain't goin' on
It's goin' around like a vagabond
It gets in your bones like you caught the flu
And now there ain't no cure
You just gotta move when you feel the groove

Now people on the left, shake your south side
People on the right, shake your south side
Every single girl, shake your south side
All around the world, shake your south side

Like Memphis, Tennessee
Got in bed with CDB
And had a baby
Oh, and when the baby cried
It made this sound
Ain't no lie, it was funkdafied
