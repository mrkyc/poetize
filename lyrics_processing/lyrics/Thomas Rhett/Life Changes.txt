Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like 'em
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

Ain't it funny how life changes?
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

I bought a ring and she said, "I do"
But everybody else said, "Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
Got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
"You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you ever seen"
Well, I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah, that's two under two, hey, what can I say?
