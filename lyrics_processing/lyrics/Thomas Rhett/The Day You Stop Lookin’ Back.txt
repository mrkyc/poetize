Stop starin' at the rearview
You ain't checkin' your hair
That wheel has spun and them lights are out
There ain't nothin' for you back there
Stop holdin' on so dang tight, 'bout time you let go
But he's a heart breakin', let you down, son-of-a-gun
But I ain't sayin' nothin' you don't know

The day you stop lookin' back
You're gonna find that the future
Sure beats the hell outta the past
Now he ain't no good
I guess he's good as gone
The day you stop lookin' back, girl, yeah
Is the day you start movin' on

That sun's gonna come up
It's gonna feel good
And after all the rain and pain you've seen
I hope you soak it up like you should
Now and then it's gonna stir up
When you hear that old song
But don't let it get to ya, baby
It's only three and a half minutes long
