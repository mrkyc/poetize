How to be proud of that town ain't nobody heard of
Had a big dream, seventeen, some day how to grow up
How to make dust fly out on a no name road
Yeah, I learned it from the radio
How to wake up, how to work tough, how to roll up those sleeves
How to throw down, how to get loud, what to put in that drink
To give the stars in the sky a little halo
Yeah, I learned it from the radio

If it wasn't for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I hadn't ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl, never woulda known what to say
I woulda never known better, I'da let her get away
Thank God for four-wheel drive, thank God for windows down
And all the DJ's in all those little static towns
How to live, how to love, everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

What to say when you think that you've found that girl
Who to call when she's gone and she wrecks your world
How to get over it, yeah, how to let her go
I learned it from the radio
How to see it all from a front porch
And how to say it all just using three chords
And when to run when you're young, when to come back home
I learned it from the radio

I learned it from the radio

From the radio
I learned it from the radio
Back when we used to burn it up, turn it up, up, up, up

If it wasn't for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I hadn't ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl, never woulda known what to say
I woulda never known better, I'da let her get away
Thank God for four-wheel drive, thank God for windows down
And all the DJ's in all those little static towns
