Oh

Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm countin' down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

I never had somethin' that I can't walk away from
Well, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's somethin' 'bout you, girl, I just can't fight

You're like that cigarette
That shot of hundred-proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin'
That feelin' when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin' you
Cravin' you
