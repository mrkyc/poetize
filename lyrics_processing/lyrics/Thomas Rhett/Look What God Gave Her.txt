Don't even want the attention
But, yeah, that's all that she's gettin'
Her song is on and she's spinnin' around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racin' like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now

And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

It's like I heard angels singin'
Like she came down from the ceilin'
When she walked in here this evenin', I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feelin'
Like there's a fire in this buildin', so hot

Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her
(Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, look what God gave her (Look what God gave her)
(Ooh, ooh)
