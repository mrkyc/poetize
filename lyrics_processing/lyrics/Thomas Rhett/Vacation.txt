My girl is rockin' that Billabong bikini like she's sponsored
Askin' me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks, but I'm spendin' them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixin', but it feels like Turks and Caicos

Put a little liquor in my coconut water (Coconut water)
Party all day like you at your alma mater (At your alma mater)
Put a little liquor in my coconut water (Coconut water)
Ice has started meltin' 'cause it's always gettin' hotter

Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation
Hey, let's party like we on vacation
Toes up in the sand, cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand, cold one in my hand (Hey)
Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation

I got my Solo cup amplifier, playin' all my jams
In my Walgreens beach chair, workin' on my tan
Feels like it's Jamaica and I'm sippin' on some Red Stripe
But I'm in Decatur, baby, crushin' on that Busch light

Hey, let's party like we on vacation
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's party like we on vacation (Come on)
I got, I got my toes up in the sand, cold one in my hand (Yeah)
Toes up in the sand, cold one in my hand (Hey)
Singin' hey, let's party like we on vacation
