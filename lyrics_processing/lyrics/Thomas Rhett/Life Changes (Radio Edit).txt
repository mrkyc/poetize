Wakin' up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Lookin' for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothin' else, no
Majorin' in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writin'
Never dreamed anybody else would like 'em
Now they're sittin' on a Walmart shelf

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothin' the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughin'
Life changes
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

I bought a ring and she said, "I do"
But everybody else said, "Man, you're twenty-two
What you tryna prove? Hey, why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waitin' on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
Got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holdin' her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

I remember the day I told my daddy and mama
"You're gonna have a grandkid (Yep)
From Uganda, that's right, we're adoptin'
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen"
Well, I was wrappin' my head around bein' a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now there's Willa and sweet Ada James
That's two under two, now hey, what can I say?
