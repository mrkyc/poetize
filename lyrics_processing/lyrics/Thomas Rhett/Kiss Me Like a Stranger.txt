Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Busy working hard, wrapped up in my job, we got bills to pay
Lately, when we talk, it feels like I don't hear a single word you say
Can we get back to the basics
And find that young love and make it?
And tear down all these walls, ignore all of our calls and just stay in

Kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we never met
Every touch a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match, light the fuse
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Lightning on my skin, every touch remembering what you mean to me, oh
Let me reminisce my lips on your lips like a symphony
Playing on my heartstrings

Kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we never met
Every touch a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match (Strike a match), light the fuse (Light the fuse)
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

It's been a little crazy lately
Come on and remind me, baby
Well, girl, don't keep me waiting
Come on over my way and lay it on me

And kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we never met
Every touch a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match (Strike a match), light the fuse (Light the fuse)
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

Ooh, won't you kiss me, won't you kiss me
Won't you kiss me like a stranger?
Mm, yeah, won't you kiss me like a stranger, baby?
Ooh, I got plans for you, I got plans for you
Ooh, I got plans for you, I got plans for you
To kiss me like a stranger, oh
You feel it now, ooh
You feel it now, ooh
