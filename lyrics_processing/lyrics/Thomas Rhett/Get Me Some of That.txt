Mm, yeah

Yeah, girl, been diggin' on you
Sippin' on drink number two
And tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth
And waitin' on the right time to make my move
But I just can't wait no more
Can't let you slip out that door
Prettiest thing I ever seen before
Got me spinnin' around, I ain't even on a dance floor

You're shakin' that money maker
Like a heart breaker, like your college major
Was twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul-saver
My favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that

Yeah, I gotta get me some of that

Little more, what you doin' right there?
Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair
Side to side with your drink in the air
Lord have mercy, now, girl, I swear (I swear)
Gotta get your number in my phone
Gotta get me some of you alone (All alone)
We can worry 'bout it later on
Right now, let's keep makin' this my favorite song

You're shakin' that money maker
Like a heart breaker, like your college major
Was twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul-saver
My favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that

Some of that
Yeah, I gotta get me some of that

In my ride, by my side, down the highway
In the dark, in my arms, in your driveway
All because of that smile you threw my way
Yeah, girl, you got a way of
Shakin' that money maker
Like a heart breaker, like your college major
Was twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul-saver
My favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
I gotta get me some of that

Yeah, I gotta get me some of that
You know it, girl, I gotta get me some of that
Oh yeah
Mm-mm

Bet your kiss is a soul-saver
My favorite flavor
