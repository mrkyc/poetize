We drank our beer in the basement
So no one would know
We didn't care where the days went
Had nowhere to go, Center Point Road
When everything was about a kiss
And clouds just looked like battleships
Helmets crashin' on the field
And we thought every love was real

We wrote our own destiny
In parkin' lots and empty streets
Yeah, we got high on you and me
Jumped over cracks beneath our feet
And we thought it would never end
Then watched it go like summer wind
When growin' up was just a dream
And Friday night was everything

Yeah, we didn't worry 'bout nothin'
We had it all, yeah
And bein' the fastest was somethin'
Runnin' the halls, breakin' the law
Life was about the party (The party, yeah)
Who you are and who you're with
Drinkin' 'til your head was sorry
Oh, and dancin' for the hell of it, yeah

Everyone says when you're younger
It's gonna go fast
It suddenly hits you like thunder
And you're gonna wanna go back
Wanna go back, wanna go back, wanna go back

We wrote our own destiny (Oh yeah)
In parkin' lots and empty streets
Yeah, we got high on you and me
Jumped over cracks beneath our feet (Oh, whoa)
