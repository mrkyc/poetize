I know I should let it go
Take a different road
When I'm driving home
But I don't want to
Delete your number from my phone
Instead of calling
Asking if you're all alone
But I don't want to

Stay away
From your side of town
But it's too late
I'm in your drive right now

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire

Ooh
I could find a spot to go hang out on Friday night
Where you are gonna be
But I don't want to, no
Yeah, I could let it end
Call it quits, call off all this on and off again
But I just don't want to

Yeah, that key
Is right under the mat
Come on in
Baby, let's strike that match

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire
Playing with fire
So let's fire it up one more time (Fire it up one more time)
Baby, just put your lips on mine (Lips on mine)

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
(We kiss and the flames just get higher)
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby (Onto you, baby)
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire (All tangled up)

I'll be back, give it time (Give it time)
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy (Sounds crazy)
