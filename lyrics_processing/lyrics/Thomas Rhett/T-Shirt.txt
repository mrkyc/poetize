Get off of work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parkin' lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

I say, "Hey, hey, baby, do you wanna come over?"
You say, "No way," then you move in closer

Next thing I know, you were in my T-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh-oh, so hot, still got it up in my head
You were movin' around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor, the way you wore
My, my T-shirt, yeah
You look good in my T-shirt, girl, oh yeah

We were walkin' up the stairs with the neighbors sayin' keep it down
Well, it's hard to unlock the door when you're makin' out (You know what I'm sayin'?)
You'll be sayin' that we gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss?
And pretty soon, you're slidin' off what you got on
