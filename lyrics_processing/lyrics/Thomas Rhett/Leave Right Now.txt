Same streets, same party
Drowning their problems in Bacardi
Same people still talking
Whoa, I'm so over it, I'm sorry

Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

You and me could
You and me could
We can leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could

If not, I get it
That smile on your face, yeah, it says different
One kiss, girl, just try it
'Cause you never know, you just might like it
