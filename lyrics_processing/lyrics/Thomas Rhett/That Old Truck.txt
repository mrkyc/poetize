Up and down the streets of a no-name town
Me and her with the windows down
35s rolling on the ground
Loving every minute
Skoal peach in the side of the door
Coke cans rolling on the floor
No, I never wanted nothing more
Yeah, that was living

I drove her to work, drove her to school
I drove her to PCB
I jacked it up, loaded it down
With all my friends and me

I grew up in it
Yeah, I got stuck in it
Playin' our song on the stereo
Drivin' 'til we ran outta road
Yeah, I broke up in it
I fell in love in it
Made a lifetime full of memories
On a half tank of gasoline
I learned just who I wasn't and who I was
In that old truck, mmm
In that old truck

I found a field, I put it in park
Blanket and a girl and a billion stars
Midnight buzz and a racing heart
When I leaned in to kiss her
I wrecked it good on some old back road
Had to call daddy to get her towed
Cussing out all that grass I mowed
Just saving up to fix her

Had some luck, fogged it up
And I ain't gonna lie
She heard me laugh, heard me cry
Heard me pray sometimes

I grew up in it
Yeah, I got stuck in it
Playin' our song on the stereo
Drivin' 'til we ran out of road
Yeah, I broke up in it
I fell in love in it
Made a lifetime full of memories
On a half tank of gasoline
I learned just who I wasn't and who I was
In that old truck, mmm
Yeah, in that old truck (Yeah)
Yeah, you might think it's crazy
And you might not understand
But that hand-me-down on four wheels
Turned this boy into a man

Yeah, I grew up in it
I got stuck in it
Jamming our song on the stereo
Drivin' 'til we ran out of road
Yeah, I broke up in it
I fell in love in it
I made a lifetime full of memories
On a half tank of gasoline
Yeah, I learned who I wasn't and who I was
But yeah, whoever's got it now, I hope they love
That old truck, mmm
Yeah, that old truck
