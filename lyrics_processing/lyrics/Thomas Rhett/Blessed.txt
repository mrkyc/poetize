Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do
Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you

You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night, I get a glimpse

And I know I'm blessed
Watching you spin in that dress
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed
And all I ain't got is my breath
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm

I keep checking you for halos
Swear you're an angel in disguise
You poke my mind from every angle, and I
I can see Heaven in your eyes

Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for
And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful
Oh, baby

Whoa, you make me believe
