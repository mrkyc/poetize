You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me

You do you, I do me
Where we go?
Wait and see
You do you, I do me
Where we go?
Wait and see

So where do we go from here? (I don't know)
Will you be far or near? (Maybe so)
And if it's meant to be (Meant to be)
It'll be, it'll be
So wait and see

So where do we go from here?
Tell me the coast is clear
I'll tell you my hopes and fears
Show you my true self
I'll let you hold the mirror
I feel your soul
And your soul is so sincere
I sowed this letter together for you
Only to say that everyday
Would be better with you
And I don't mean to sound soft
I'm a nigga from The Bronx
But oh God, I'm think about forever with you
Only time tells
And can you tell me the time?
Cause someone like you
Is hell to find, hella fine
Well, if I'm not busy
By the end of the night
You can come through
And pretend to be mine
We can go from there
Whatever you want
I got a chauffeur
The whole nine yards
For the whole premiere
I'm so prepared
And girl, I been alone all year
So where you wanna go from here?
You might also like
You do you, I do me
Where we go?
Wait and see
You do you, I do me
Where we go?
Wait and see

And if I do me, and you do you
Then by the end of it
We both got nothing to lose
So live your life, I'll live mine too
But you'll probably be back
By the midnight blues, dim light hues
Smoke clouds in my views
Girl, this lit cigarette sure hit like you
Addicted, it's true
You ain't nothing different boo
Matter fact, I should probably quit you too
And once I do, where the fuck I go from here?
Long nights on my own is my only fear
And damn it's weird
I'm rich, but I have no peers
The only woman in my crib is my chandelier
And this bad little shawty I call Mary Jane
It's half past two forty, time to bury pain
Burn another J and start thinking 'bout everything
Like how far we came
And where we have to go
Cause girl I don't know
Oh, you miss me now
Was it all just a phase?
I don't see how
You could push me away
And give all this up
When did we break?
This shit doesn't feel
Feel the same

You do you, I do me
Where we go?
Wait and see
You do you, I do me
Where we go?
Wait and see

So where do we go from here? (I don't know)
Will you be far or near? (Maybe so)
And if it's meant to be (Meant to be)
It'll be, it'll be
So wait and see

You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me
You love me, you love me
