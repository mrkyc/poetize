Oi! Oi! Oi!

I figured out the problem, yeah, the problem is you
You didn't see us comin', now there's nothin' you can do
Times are gonna change, change or step aside
It's a point of view that took you by surprise
The sun's comin' up, yeah, the new dawn arrives
New generation standing, stand with anger in their eyes
No love in the city 'cause there's no connection
Been stricken by disease, a racial infection

I'm a batterin' ram comin' through at you
In every alleyway on every avenue
Oi! Oi! Oi!

Actions could erase all the fear that we suffer
People segregated, no one understands each other
He's a different color, but we're the same kin
I'll treat him like my brother, he'll treat me like his
Well an eye for an eye, yeah, a tooth for a tooth
Brother against brother, should be singin' with the group
The inner cities burnin', yeah, it's screamin' black and blue
The power and the passion of a million youth
You might also like
I'm a batterin' ram comin' through at you
In every alleyway on every avenue
Oi! Oi! Oi!

Oi! Oi! Oi!

I figured out the problem, yeah, the problem is you
You didn't see us comin', now there's nothin' you can do
He's a different color, but we're the same kin
I'll treat him like my brother, he'll treat me like his
All the blood that spills of all the guts that fly
The media paints a picture that stings all our eyes
Pits the dogs against the cats, now who is responsible?
The power in the issue, the force is unstoppable

I'm a batterin' ram comin' through at you
In every alleyway on every avenue
Oi! Oi! Oi!
Yeah

Oi! Oi! Oi!
I'm a batterin' ram comin' through at you
In every alleyway on every avenue
Oi! Oi! Oi!
I'm a batterin' ram comin' through at you
In every alleyway on every avenue
