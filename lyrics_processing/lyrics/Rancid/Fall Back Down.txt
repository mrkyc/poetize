Don't worry about me, I'm gonna make it alright
Got my enemies cross-haired and in my sight
I take a bad situation gonna make it right
In the shadows of darkness I stand in the light
You see it's our style to keep it true
I had a bad year, a lot I've gone through
I've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue
She's not the one coming back for you
She's not the one coming back for you

If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend

It takes disaster to learn a lesson
You're gonna make it through the darkest nights
Some people betray one and cause treason
We're going to make everything alright

Well, the worst of times, they don't faze me
Even if I look and act really crazy
On my way down she betrayed me
Now my vision is no longer hazy
I'm very lucky to have my crew
They stood by me when she flew
I've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue
She's not the one coming back for you
She's not the one coming back for you

If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend


If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
