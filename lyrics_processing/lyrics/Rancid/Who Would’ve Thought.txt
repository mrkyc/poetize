And who would've thought I ended up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are lighting darkness, coming through
Silhouetted palm trees backing up against the sky
Echo park sunset, an ambulance drives by
Well, someone went down and I wonder who
Faces flash forth could it be anybody I knew
So I drank like a fish till I crawl like a rat
In the city of shit, I ended up on my back
But I can't believe you're with me after dark
So let it come together in Echo Park
And I said, who would've thought that dreams come true
And who would've thought I'd end up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are lighting darkness, coming through
A red flag and nobody wins
Or a snake bite, gotta start again
So I'm fucked up from watching TV all day
I don't wanna see what Ricki Lake's gotta say
And it hits me when I'm alone, I'm an angry man
I start singing to myself, I got dealt a shitty hand
With all these feelings my heart could explode
So , no not at all
You might also likeAnd I said, who would've thought that dreams come true
And who would've thought I'd end up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are light and darkness coming through
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Who would've thought that dreams come true
And who would've thought I'd end up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are lighting darkness, coming through
Now my dreams are coming true
