Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, here we go
I'm money broke and it's no joke
Can't cope, use the rope this time
Knuckle up, buckle up, the ride's getting rough
And I will not lose my mind
I asked her if I could come in
And the first thing she said was no
If I can't come in, that means I can't come back
I got nowhere to go
I'm a hyena, fighting for the lion's share (right)
Sometimes the lion's share ain't there
I'm a hyena, fighting for the lion's share (hear me out)
Sometimes the lion's share ain't there
Absent from political authority, an animal I've become
Total disorder and confusion is the lifestyle that I run
Permit me to do what I want and I will
I'm a nomad to travel
Concrete, glass, stone and gravel
I'm a hyena, fighting for the lion's share (right)
Sometimes the lion's share ain't there
A hyena, fighting for the lion's share (hear me out)
Sometimes the lion's share ain't there, it ain't there
You might also likeEvery time I turn around it's the same sad story
Getting ganked, I wish it would end
In life's commissary, I'm a bad missionary
With a wicked message I send
Fighting to kill before I lose that shit
And that's just the way I wanna live
Who can I trust in a world of greed
When I'm taught to take and not give?
Who can I trust when I'm taught to take and not give?
I'm money broke and it's no joke
Can't cope, use the rope this time
Knuckle up, buckle up, the ride's getting rough
And I will not lose my mind
Permit me to do what I want and I will
'Cause I'm a nomad to travel
Concrete, glass, stone and gravel
See, there's nothing you can say that's gonna change my mind
Fuck you
I'm a hyena, fighting for the lion's share (right)
Sometimes the lion's share ain't there
Sometimes the lion's share ain't there
