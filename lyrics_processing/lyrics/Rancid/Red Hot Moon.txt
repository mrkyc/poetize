You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Casey's from Cali-California
She's got a reputation that she didn't ask for
She's waiting for an escape now
That escape is called the one sixty four
Now, Casey, she won't admit when she is wrong
Now Casey, she wants to run, run, run
She's a punk rocker, she don't trust no one
On a south bay bus all alone
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Casey was never caught up
Like the rest of the rats in a fucking maze
Check me out she said, I'm in a concrete jungle
I'm an individual and you are stuck in a haze
Oh hell no, she knows what the truth is
'Cause she said so, she knows who her friends are
So fuck you, don't get no closer
It'll only make her run far away

I know Casey's brother pretty well
You see, we spent a lot of time hanging out
I always thought for sure that she'd be the one
To get out of here and make a life for herself
But when we found her in the little league park
In the dugouts, it was cold in the dark
And no one knew why she wouldn't wake up
I think she finally made it back home
Under the red hot moon

One time for your mind, two times for your soul
Three for the graveyards and the money I fold
Dimmed out in the city where the sun burns slow
No hope, it's a pity, I can't say no
It's not my time to go, it's not my time to die
The last thing I want is for my mother to cry
It was love at first light the very first night
Things have never been the same since I took my first flight
The way I live my life, I love, I live lavish
Lost me from the start, you lose, you'll never have it
Untouched, unleashed, back up, you don't want it
Stick him for his cash, his bag, it's how he flaunt it
Take two and pass, I'll take two and blast
Bust a motherfucker, I'm out on the smash
Pimped out, high as fuck, I'm out of control
Let's bounce, rock, skate, man I'm ready to roll
Under the red hot moon
Under the red hot moon
Under the red hot moon
Under the red hot moon
