Stop!
Here we go!

Knock knock, come in
You wanna fight, I'm gonna win
I'll take you out in a minute
Step in my flat and see what's in it
I live in the land of the welfare state
My flat used to be Section 8
Now it's rat-infested, cocaine run
My whole world plays like a broken drum

Junkie, drunken bum
Yeah yeah yeah, rats in the hallway again

Get up, get out, go ahead and ride away
Sit up our bed up your bed to lay
Kick up or rip up this place apart
Even when I'm finished, I'm back at the start
I'm out of line on Adeline Street
Heat don't keep this crooked beat
4 a.m., no waves breaking
What's left of the p.m. the a.m. has taken

Outside my gate, my crew is drinking a 40
Asked me if there's still rats in the hallway
I said some things aren't like the weather
Never seen 'em changing for the better
This girl came up to me she said she would do me no harm
Rolled up her sleeve and showed me the tracks on her arm
I said what's your name, she said it was Mia
She said Tim, I wanna take you higher

Junkie, drunken bum
Yeah yeah yeah, rats in the hallway again


Zombie walking kid out on his own with no morale
Mr. High leaves the body, in comes Mr. Withdrawal
Pain is the only thing the body will allow
The kid wants to dance, the gangster knows how
Johnny bought some dope on Civic and Market
Shoot up and boot up the human target
He hit the dirty spike when he hit the scene
It's easy to stay dirty when nothing is clean
He's a writer who tags up Jackal
Jackal just clamped on unclampable shackles
Boot up, shoot up some dope to go
Like legal currency, it's money you know

It's like that, rat-tat-tat
Kid got shot point blank in the back
My landlord said, not to be bumming
He was on cocaine stoop and he had it coming
He had it coming? He was only 12 years old
Sitting in a blizzard, he got shot for being cold
It don't seem right tonight, hit the lights alright
Watch the roaches run into the darkest room

Junkie, drunken bum
Yeah yeah yeah, rats in the hallway again
Junkie, drunken bum
