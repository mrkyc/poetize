You and me
We used to be together
Every day together always (Always)
I really feel
Like I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end

It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
They can be inviting
Sometimes shining on me (On me, oh)
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands, I start to cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
Let's stop pretending who we are
(Who we are, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It's all ending
Let's stop pretending who we are
(Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
