What is a woman
To do with a man
Who treats her unkindly
When she's down, all she can
I cried so many nights
How we fuss and fight
The make-ups and the break-ups
I loved you and only you
The things you do

When you love somebody (Love, love)
When you love somebody, yeah (Love, love)
Things you do, oh

I gave you my lovin'
With no questions asked
Tears on my pillow
From all your disrespect
I didn't care about your past
I only wanted to make us last
And oh, I loved you and only you
The things you do
