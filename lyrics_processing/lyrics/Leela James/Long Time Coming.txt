Y'all mind
I'd like to talk to y'all this evening

Ante up, time to let the trumpets sound
Crown me later, I'ma take my crown now
Been writing for about ten years now
And finally the real truth is coming out
You can't stop it 'cause this is God's plan
I know some of y'all just don't understand
And now you twisted, can't believe it's me
Get it, it's Leela, sho'nuff

It's been a long time since you heard it like this
It's been a long time since you felt it like this
It's been a long time since you seen it like this
'Cause ain't nobody bringing it quite like this, no
I've been praying for a time like this
And I've been waiting for a time like this
I've been talking about a time like this
A long time coming that you get it like this

Through the rain, through the pain, I'm still around
Thank God kept me on solid ground
My ship started out with many aboard
But when the pressures got rough, they jumped ashore
I've seen many, many, many go and come
Even watched some of y'all faking the funk
But you can't lie, you can't make it, it's in your blood
You either got it or you don't

It's been a long time since you heard it like this
It's been a long time since you felt it like this
It's been a long time since you seen it like this
'Cause ain't nobody bringing it quite like this
I've been praying for a time like this
And I've been waiting for a time like this
I've been talking 'bout a time like this
A long time coming that you get it like this, well, well, well

Oh Lord, yeah
Somebody help me say
Now, talk to the DJs, I said
Hey, DJ would you play my song
Keep it banging (All night long)
Hey, DJ would you play my song
Keep it banging (All night long)
Hey, DJ would you play my song
Keep it banging (All night long)
Hey, DJ would you play my song
Keep it banging (All night long)

It's been a long time since you heard it like this
It's been a long time since you felt it like this
It's been a long time since you seen it like this
'Cause ain't nobody bringing it quite like this
And I've been praying for a time like this
And I've been waiting for a time like this
I've been talking about a time like this
A long time coming that you get it like this
Sounds like something that you've had before
But it ain't really something that you've had before
Feels like something that you've felt before
But it ain't really something that you've felt before
Ain't really something that you've seen before
'Cause it sure ain't something that you've seen before
Y'all know it's been a long time coming
Been a long time coming, yeah
But a change surely has come
It's been a long time
DJs, this is for you
Ain't nobody bringing it quite like this, no
Can you feel me? Yeah
Been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
