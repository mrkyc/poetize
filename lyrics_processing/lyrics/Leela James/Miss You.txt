Waiting for your call
When the phone rings
Yeah, it's just some friends of mine
That wanna have a time, say
"Hey, what's with you?

With some Puerto Rican girls that are dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Let's go and have a time, like we used to"

Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Come on, come on
I've was walking in Central Park
Hanging after dark, people think I'm crazy
Shuffling through the street
Just aching on my feet
People ask me, "What's the matter with you boy? "
Sometimes I want to say
Sometimes I want to say, yeah
Sometimes I want to say, to myself
