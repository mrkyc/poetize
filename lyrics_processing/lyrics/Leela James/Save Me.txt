He used to love me the way you love me
But now things ain't the same
I don't know why he changed
He gave me flowers, we'd talk for hours
But now all that we do is argue
And I'm so through

Even when he loved me
He didn't love me like you do
Now, he's tearing up my heart
Is there anything you can do?
It's an emergency

I need you to save me
Rescue me, baby
'Cause I'm going crazy (Go crazy)
Goin' crazy
I need you save me
Rescue me, baby
'Cause I'm going crazy
Goin' crazy (Go crazy)

And I don't wanna drown (Drown)
You got me going down (Down)
Please save me (Save me)
Ooh baby (Ooh baby)
And I don't wanna drown (Drown)
You got me going down (Down)
Please save me
Ooh baby, save me
