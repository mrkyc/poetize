You know love ain't gotta be this hard
Why you making it so complicated?

Boy, something happens when we get together
You're giving me joy, a feeling that's forever
Baby, you know what to do when
We get 'round each other, it's magnetic, ooh
I want you, oh, so what are we waiting for?

What we gon' do? Oh
Don't make this complicated (Complicated, no, oh)
You know you want it too
You know that I've been waiting, baby (I've been waiting for you)
What we gon' do?
Don't make this complicated
So what you gon' do? (What you wanna do?)
You know I really want you (And you want me too)

Ooh, I, I said I was your one and only (If I was your girl)
If I gave every piece of my heart, what would you do?
What you want, what you need, boy, I got
All this love and it won't ever stop
So what we gon' do about it? (Do about it)
Say you gon' be about it, ooh
