Mmm, mmm, oh, yeah, mmm
Listen

Last night you didn't call
Had me waiting all night long
Why you keep doing me wrong?
I don't know, babe
And it hurts so bad
I'm tired of being sad
This house is not a home
The love is gone, baby

I just can't see it
(I can't see, baby)
Wasting anymore time (Oh no, oh no)
Staying in this with you
(You, you, you)

If you love me (If you love me)
Set me free (Set me free)
'Cause we're just holding on to nothing
(We're holding on to nothing)
Let me be
Oh, if you love me
Set me free
'Cause I want more than nothing
Just set me free if you love me

If you love me (If you love me)
If you care (Like you said you did)
Be man enough to let me go instead of staying here
Pretending like we love each other
When we both know there's something better waiting for me

I just can't see it (I can't see, baby)
Wasting any more time (We're just waiting time)
Staying in this with you
(And I just can't stay, I just can't stay with you)

If you love me
Set me free (Set me free)
'Cause we're just holding on to nothing
(We're just holding on to nothing, nothing, nothing)
Let me be
If you love me (Oh, if you love me)
Set me free (Set me free, babe)
'Cause I want more than nothing
Oh, just set me free if you love me

What happened to the love we had?
It went away somehow
It used to be so good
But it's all bad now
And I tried to make it work (Tried to make it work)
I tried to fit the play (Tried to fit the play)
I gave it all I got
Can't you understand? Oh
If you love me (If you love me)
Set me free (Set me free, baby)
'Cause we're just holding on to nothing
('Cause we're holding on to nothing, nothing)
Let me be
If you love me (If you love me)
Set me free (Set me free)
'Cause I want more than nothing
('Cause I want more, I need more)
Just set me free if you love me
(Set me free if you love me)

Set me free, set me free
Let me go 'cause it's bad for me
We're holding on, we're holding on to nothing
Oh, if you love me, let me free
