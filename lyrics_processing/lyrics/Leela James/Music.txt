Somebody play on the guitar strings
Makes me think of my favorite songs
Reminds me of when I heard Aretha sing
Gladys, Tina, and Chaka Khan
It can't go back to yesterday (Yesterday)
But can we just put the thongs away

And fall back in love with music
Nothing but the music
Oh
Everybody knows that Marvin's gone
Still I gotta tell you what's going on
Said the music's gone

Where did the soul go?
It's all about the video
We don't sing no more (No more)
Where's the music gone? (No, no) Oh
Where did the music go?
It's all just for the dough
It ain't soul no more (No more)
Where's the music gone? (No, no)

Somebody hollerin' 'bout a bitch or a ho (Wait a minute)

Right now I'm missing music
Black folks down home music
Oh, oh

Where did the soul go?
It's all about the video
We don't sing no more (No more)

Where did the music go?

Tell me, can we get back? Can we get back?
I wanna talk about it, I'm gonna talk about it
I'm gonna sing about it, I'm gonna sing about it
Mmm, all the music's gone, all the soul is gone
Let's take it back (Take it back)
Take it back (Take it back), oh, oh
(Music) Take it back

It's all just for the dough
