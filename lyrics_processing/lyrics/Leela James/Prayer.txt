Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Living in a cold, cold world, sometimes it gets hard
And you feel like you can't make it out
When I was just a little girl, my mama told me
"Don't you worry
Hold your head, and wear a smile
'Cause you're gonna have days
When you feel like things ain't going your way
Just take a moment and pray"

Where would I be (I don't know)
Where would I be (Oh no, no)
Where would I be if you ain't never heard a prayer from me? (Tell me what)
What would I do (Oh)
What would I do (I don't know)
What would I do if I didn't have you to be there for me? (Yeah, mhm)

I'm so thankful for
All the things you've done
Showing me right from wrong
And cleansing my soul
When all my friends turned their back on me
You made me see
You're the only one I need

Where would I be (Oh, I don't know)
Where would I be (Oh no, no)
Where would I be if you ain't never heard a prayer from me?

What would I do (oh)
What would I do (No, no, no)
What would I do if I didn't have you to be there for me? (And I thank you, Lord)
Where would I be? (Where)
Where would I be? (Where would I be, y'all)
Where would I be if you ain't never heard a prayer from me?
(Without the love of my Lord, Lord, Lord)
What would I do
What would I do (What would I do)
What would I do if I didn't have you to be there for me? (Without the love of my Lord)

Way in the midnight hour, I called your name
'Cause I knew you were watching over me (Over me)
And I don't know just where I' be
If somebody never said a prayer for me

Where would I be
Where would I be (And I thank)
Where would I be if you ain't never heard a prayer from me? (I thank you, Lord)
What would I do (Where would I be without you?)
What would I do  (And what would I do)
What would I do if I didn't have you to be there for me?
(I just wanna thank)
Where would I be (I just wanna thank you, Lord)
Where would I be (Oh)
Where would I be if you ain't never heard a prayer from me?
(For never leaving my side, for never leaving my side, Lord)
What would I do (In my trials)
What would I do (Nor my tribulations)
What would I do if I didn't have you to be there for me?
You stayed beside me
And I thank, I thank, I thank, I thank
(I, I just wanna thank you, Lord)
Oh Lord

Somebody oughta just try and believe me

Oh my Lord's been good to me, y'all
(I, I just wanna thank you, Lord)
Oh my Lord's been good to me
(I, I just wanna thank you, Lord)
And I'm gonna tell the world
(I, I just wanna thank you, Lord)
I'm gon' sing and shout his name

Where would I be (Woo)
Where would I be (Oh Lord)
Where would I be if you ain't never heard a prayer from me?
(Where would I be? Where would I be?)
And what would I do
(I wouldn't be standing here tonight, y'all)
What would I do
(And I wouldn't be singing this song to y'all)
What would I do if I didn't have you to be there for me?
Through my trails and tribulations
You stayed beside me
(I, I just wanna thank you, Lord)
Oh Lord
(I, I just wanna thank you, Lord)
Somebody oughta tell 'em
