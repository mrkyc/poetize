Tonight is the night, we gone have a good time
Tonight I wanna party, can't wait to hook up with my crew (my crew, my groove)
I'm so happy it's the weekend
'cause I'm gone let my hair hang down
And shake my thang around
Deejay play my groove
'cause I'm really in the mood, and you know just what to do (tonight is my night)
Tonight is the night, we gone have a good time, lets just have a good time (come on and shake ya'll)
Tonight is the night, we gone have a good time, lets just have a good time
Forget your worries, just leave them behind
'cause life's too short, you need to find a good time (good time)
So get your booty on the dance floor, that's what we came here for, no parking on the floor no more
Deejay play my groove
'cause I'm really in the mood, and you know just what to do (tonight is my night)
Tonight is the night, we gone have a good time, lets just have a good time (come on and shake ya'll)
Tonight is the night, we gone have a good time, lets just have a good time
**Music interlude**
Ooooo.. Tonight is the night, lets party.... Ooooo
Ooooo.. Tonight is the night, lets party.... Ooooo
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Tonight is the night, we gone have a good time, lets just have a good time (clap your hands and sing ya'll)
Tonight is the night, we gone have a good time, lets just have a good time

Tonight is the night, we gone have a good time, lets just have a good time
