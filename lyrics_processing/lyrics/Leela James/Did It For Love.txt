In my head everything seems so right
And I know it didn't happen overnight
I can feel, been fallin' for all your lies
But I didn't, I was in too deep to realize

I can't help it, but I don't know, I don't know, but I don't know, oh!
Somethin' down in my soul, yeah, in my soul, I couldn't let it go
And I tried, and I tried
But what I feel I can't disguise
All I did, all I can do, I can't run, I gotta face the truth

I did it for love (love)
All for love
I got lost in love
And I'll do it with love
I did it for love (love)
All for love (love)
I got lost in love (love)
And I'll do it with love

In the high, somewhere up in the cloud
Didn't know that I was fallin' down
So if I go, look at what you did to me
Right or wrong (Right or wrong)
Really thought that we could be
