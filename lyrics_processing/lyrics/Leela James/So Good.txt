You're too good to be true
I'm feeling new
'Cause you're feeling me and I'm feeling you
I never ever thought I could have it all
But you got what I need and more

'Cause I ain't never have love as good (No, no)
You treat me just the way you should (Like you should)
Better than before (Oh)
You keep me coming back for more (Oh, oh)

Your love is so good (Oh), so good (Ah), so good (Yeah)

So glad I gave you a try
'Cause you keep me high
I see myself with you for the rest of my life
You're too good to be true
I'm feeling new
'Cause you're feeling me and I'm feeling you
I never ever thought I could have it all
But you got what I need and more
