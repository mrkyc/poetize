Hmm, dear, naw
To whom it may concern

I guess this is my reward
For giving him all my love
With holding nothing yeah
Nothing could quantify
The feelings I had inside
Still he took me for granted

Don't worry about nothing, don't, don't worry bout nothing
It's all for the good, it's better this way
(To whom it may concern)
It's alright, it's alright
Cause I tried and I tried
It's alright, it's alright
And I cried and I cried
It's alright, it's alright
But it's alright now, but it's alright now
Said it's alright

I thought he was infallible
Perfect in every way
King to my kingdom
I put him on a pedestal
Never thinking he'd, he'd hurt me this way
(How could you hurt me this way?)
