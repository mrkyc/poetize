I'd start by saying that we'll never part
And please say that you will be mine
Until the end of time
If I were a lock I'd let you be the key
To unlock all of this love in me
To unlock all of this ecstasy
And if you think that I'm worried
Let your mind be rest assured
(Let your heart be rest assured)
My love is light as a feather
But hard as a rock
(Yeah let your mind be rest assured)
Yeah the cupid has found us
I don't wanna stop
If you will be my Mrs. Incredible
I'll be your Mr. Unforgettable
Always forever and ever always always
And if you be my Mr. Incredible
I'll be your Miss Unforgettable
Always forever and ever always always
If this were a play you'll be my leading man
The words you recite would touch my soul
And I would direct you to touch to hold
And love me all through the night
If I could be your never ending song
I'd play while we make love all night long
Do away with your baggage
Your worries and all of your fears
So if you're worried baby
Let your heart be rest assured
(Let your mind be rest assured)
Yeah the cupid has found us
I don't wanna stop baby if you be my
My incredible superwoman
(My superman)
Baby I'll be your king
(I'll be your queen)
And your superman
(Baby you'll be my king)
'Cause I'll be your superwoman
(Could you be my wonder woman?)
My super man
(I could be your)
Be your
(Wonderful)
If you be my man
(Wonderful wondeman)
F you'll be my Mrs. Incredible
I'll be your Mr. Unforgettable
Always forever and ever always always
If you will be my Mr. Incredible
I'll be your Miss Incredible
Always forever and ever always always
If I could write a letter to your heart
I'd start by saying that we'll never part
