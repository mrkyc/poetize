Ante up, time to let the trumpets sound
Crown me later, I'ma take my crown now
Been writing for 'bout 10 yrs now
And finally the real truth is coming out
You can't stop it 'cause this is God's plan
I know some of y'all just don't understand
And now ya twisted, can't believe it's me
Get it, it's Leela sho nuff
It's been a long time since ya heard it like this
It's been a long time since ya felt it like this
It's been a long time since ya seen it like this
'Cause ain't nobody bringing it quite like this
I've been praying for a time like this
And I've been waiting for a time like this
I've been talking 'bout a time like this
A long time coming but you get it like this
Through the rain, through the pain I'm still around
Thank God kept me on solid ground
My ship started out with many aboard
But when the  got rough they jumped ashore
I've seen many many many go and come
Even watched some of y'all faking the funk
But you can't lie, can't fake it, it's in your blood
Ya either got it or ya don't
It's been a long time since ya heard it like this
It's been a long time since ya felt it like this
It's been a long time since ya seen it like this
'Cause ain't nobody bringing it quite like this
I've been praying for a time like this
And I've been waiting for a time like this
I've been talking 'bout a time like this
A long time coming but you get it like this
Now, talk to the DJ, I said
Hey, DJ won't ya play my song
Keep it banging all night long
Hey, DJ won't ya play my song
Keep it banging all night long
Hey, DJ won't ya play my song
Keep it banging all night long
Hey, DJ won't ya play my song
Keep it banging all night long, all night long
It's been a long time since ya heard it like this
It's been a long time since ya felt it like this
It's been a long time since ya seen it like this
'Cause ain't nobody bringing it quite like this
And I've been praying for a time like this
And I've been waiting for a time like this
I've been talking 'bout a time like this
A long time coming but you get it like this
Sounds like something that you've had before
But it ain't really something that you've had before
Feels like something that you've felt before
But it ain't really something that you've felt before
Ain't really something that you've seen before
'Cause it sure ain't something that you've seen before
Been a long time coming, yeah
But the time surely has come
It's been a long time
DJ this is for you
Ain't nobody bringing it quite like this, now
Can you feel me, yeah
Been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
