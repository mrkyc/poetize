Two o'clock in the morning
You on my phone tryna talk to me and
Saying that you want me back
You need me back, and you shoulda never left me
There you go, talking that shit, same old shit
Don't wanna hear that shit, no
I remember when you had me
You treated me bad, you treated me badly

You had a good thing, you had a good thing, yeah
And you let it go (You let it go)

And now you wanna try to come back, but no (No, no, no)
I would never take you back, no (No, no, no)
It's funny how you try to come back, no (Ha ha)
It's too late
I've moved on, and I don't want you back
(I don't want your love...I don't want your love)

I don't want your love...you can keep your love
'Cause someone else is living here
Someone else is saying my name, baby
He's cooking me breakfast, wining, dining, flowers for no reason
He's doing what he's s'posed to do
Ooh...it coulda been you
