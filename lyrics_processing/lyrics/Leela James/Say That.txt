See, my sun won't shine
Ain't no stars at night
I swear the sky ain't blue
It's raining, storming, gray without you
Ain't no flame in the fire
I'm just empty inside
I'm sick by the very thought of
Spending my days and being without you

Got me thinking 'bout "I do"
You got me thinking, thinking
To you, I always will be true
I'll always, yeah
And I know you feel it, too

Say that you want me
Say that you need me
Say that you'll have me just the way that I am
Say that you love me
Put no one above me
Say I'm your woman
And you are my man, my man
