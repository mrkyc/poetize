I don't know what to say when I think about what I've been through
It's been ups and downs like a carousel, yes, it's true
When it comes, yeah, it hurts
And all the pain's unrehearsed
I wanna put it all in reverse

I wish I didn't know, know, know
All the things you try not to show
But it's hard to keep a real woman down
We always bounce back, never rebound
Still hold my head with a smile, ooh (No, no, no, no)

That's what happens when the love goes cold (Goes cold)
And you feel like you gon' lose your soul
Get up and put your heels on, baby
It hurts, but, no, it ain't gon' break me
Oh no, you can't take my crown away (Take it away)
Ooh, you'll never break my soul

You thought you had me (Had me, yeah)
Thought I would not survive all the lies, but the truth is
It's a blessing in disguise, I'm floatin' on Cloud 9
I moved on with my life, ooh-ooh

I wish I didn't know, yeah (Know, know, know)
All the things you try not to show

Talk to 'em, Mumu
(You'll never break my soul)

The Lord is my shepherd, so I shall not run
Gotta repeat it 'til I mean it, God, lift me up
Though He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
Don't think He meant for me to lie down with lyin' bastards
Who would rather see my soul captured and fractured
But you must not know 'bout me
I gets that last laughter
I never ran backwards, chasin' after cancer
Managin' this damage
No, I can't be your rafters no more
(Thank God) Thank You for resilience
Now, I ain't one in a million, I'm from a lineage of brilliance
Who taught me how to bounce back from scrimmages
And rise up like phoenixes from pillages
Boy, you creatin' a monster
So I'm back on my goals, every day I'm gettin' stronger
I'm a whole vibe, baby, even when I'm somber
Watch this glow-up from the beaches over yonder
That's what happens when the love goes cold (Goes cold)
And you feel like you gon' lose your soul
Get up and put your heels on, baby
It hurts, but, no, it ain't gon' break me
Oh no, you can't take my crown away (Take it away)
Ooh, you'll never break my soul

(Love goes cold, goes cold)
My soul
(Heels on, baby)
(Ain't gon' break me)
