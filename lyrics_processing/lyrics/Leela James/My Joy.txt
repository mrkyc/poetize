This song right here is to that, that, that, that person
I won't even gonna mention his name
That said I couldn't do nothing without him
Mmm

Who are you to tell me that I can't go on without you?
And why you tellin' me I'm never gon' survive?
Mmm, but once upon a time, yes, I believed that lie (Oh Lord)
But sorry, no way, no how, you can't control my mind

Well, 'cause if I thought you were the end all, and my be all
I woulda never left you alone, and I wouldn't be on my own
And I never, never would've grown, mmm

Nah, nah, nah, ain't no way
You gon' take away my joy, my peace, my strength, mhm
Nah, nah, nah, ain't no way
You gon' take away my joy, my peace, my strength, yeah

Thank you for the times of all the pain you gave me
The hate you showed to me taught me how to love myself
It's funny how you tried to break down my pride, and my spirit, y'all
It doesn't even matter now 'cause I done moved on with my life (My life)

You can't take away my joy

'Cause if I thought you were the end all, and my be all
I woulda never left you alone, I wouldn't be on my own (Nah)
I never woulda found peace, I never woulda loved again
If I thought you were my end all, and my be all
(I never) I never woulda found peace (Never woulda found peace)
I never woulda loved again (I never woulda loved)

My joy, joy, joy (My joy), joy, joy, joy
Can't take away my joy
