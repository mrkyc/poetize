Gave my best, gave my all, forced me against the wall
Tired of trying to make it right and I knew it was wrong
And all along I closed my eyes, things I should have known was high
Instead I fell for your disguise and you saw my demise
And I'm still standing here
Through my pain, my sweat, my tears, oh
Still smile cause it's alright
You did me cold but I survived

I gave my best to you
Oh didn't I, give my best to you
Said didn't I, give my best to you
Said didn't I, didn't I, didn't, I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I gave my best to said
Didn't I give my best to you
Didn't I give my best to you
Said I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried

Didn't I trust you and treat you like you were my king
Tried to help, was working, but you was on the sly
But I'm still standing here
Through my pain, my sweat my tears, oh
Still smile cause it's alright
You did me cold but I survived
