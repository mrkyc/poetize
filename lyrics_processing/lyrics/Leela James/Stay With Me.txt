Stay with me, don't leave
Stay

The moonlight, the songs I write
It's so sexy, it's crazy and baby, ooh, I want you
Tonight it feels so right
My body is ready, I'm yearning
I've got to have you now
So would you stay with me, stay with me

And I just wanna be where, wherever you are
And I just wanna be where, wherever you are

Stay, stay, stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay, stay with me (Stay, stay with me), stay
Stay, stay, stay with me (Stay with me)
Stay, stay with me (Stay with me), stay

Don't leave me, I need you
To hold me and touch me, kiss me
Never leave my side (My side, my side)
'Cause when you're not here, I'm just not the same (Not the same)
And I'm so blue
