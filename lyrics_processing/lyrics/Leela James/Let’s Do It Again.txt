Sometimes the rain
Groovin' when I hear the sound
Like you and me, baby
Gettin' down with the sounds around
Oh, the smell of the mornin' flower
As we pass away the hour
I wanna do it again, do it again
Do it (Do it)

Let's do it in the mornin'
Sweet breeze in the summer time
Feeling your sweet face
All laid up next to mine
Sweet love in the midnight
Good sleep, come mornin' light
No worries 'bout nothin'
Just gettin' good, just gettin' good
Just gettin' good love

See, the way that feels, is the way it used to feel
Ain't that right, Randall?
You know that's right. That's right
See, I love the Staple Singers
I mean, Pop Staples. Mavis Staples
That's The epitome of Soul Right There
I love them so much that I told my band
"look here, fellas. We got to re-visit this thang here
Cause, err, uh, we gotta take it back
I say 'why not do it again? Why not do some of them Great
Soul records again?
They was like "yeah! Let's do it again"
I say "yeah. let's do it again."
I called up Myron and said "Myron, call the studio. Let's get in there today"
