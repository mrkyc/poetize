Yeah, well alright (Oh yeah)
Oh (Oh yeah)
Oh, sister Betty Wright sang it best (Oh yeah)
And we gon' take it back a little bit

The clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine

Jumpin' slick was my ruin
But I found out all I was doin'

Was makin' it easy, girl, for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh yeah
Yeah, I made it easy, mmm, for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, uh-huh

I took this man and I put him on the shelf
And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself
When he needed love, I was out havin' fun
And you know what he did?
He went on and got him somebody else

The clean up woman will wipe his blues away
(Wipe his blues away)
She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day
The clean up woman will sweep him off his feet
(Sweep him off his feet)
And she's the one that'll take him in
When you dump him on the street
So take a tip, you better get hip
To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough
You know you better clean up
