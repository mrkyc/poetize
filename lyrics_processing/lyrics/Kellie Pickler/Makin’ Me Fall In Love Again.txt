People will tell you that this kind of love will fade
That being in love like this is only a phase
But baby, after all this time, ain't nothin' changed
All you gotta do is look at me that way

And there you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again

Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
You only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again

Baby, sometimes you can say the craziest things
I love how you don't care what nobody thinks
You're highly original, totally in-typical, never change
All I gotta do is look at your smiling face

There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again
You might also like
Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
You only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again

You're my sunshine, you're my rain
Sure feels good to know you feel the same

I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
Only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again

There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go, there you go makin' me fall in love again

Makin' me fall in love again
(There you go, there you go)
Makin' me fall in love again
(There you go, there you go)
Makin' me fall in love again
(There you go, there you go)
