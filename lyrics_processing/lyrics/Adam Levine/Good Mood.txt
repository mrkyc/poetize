You make me dance, yeah, you do, ooh
You got my heart beatin' rhythms when you move
Don't need no plans, feelin' loose
Like there's a rainbow of magic next to you

When it's good, when it's bad, yeah, you got me
Not alone in this town 'cause you make me feel
Anytime that I call, you'll be ready
Anytime, anytime
And when I turn around, I see you there
You got a way to make a problem disappear
Up to the clouds, I'm spinning 'round
And now you know why

'Cause no one in this world can make me feel loved
In the way that you wanna do now
No, no one in this world can make me come down
When I'm this so good, good mood now

Ooh, woo-hoo (Ooh)
A good mood

Hop in my ride, don't you know, oh?
We got the sun always shinin' wherever we go
Don't need no map, we just roll
Let the vibe give direction, take control

When it's good, when it's bad, yeah, you got me
Not alone in this town 'cause you make me feel
Anytime that I call, you'll be ready
Anytime, anytime
And when I turn around, I see you there
You got a way to make a problem disappear
Up to the clouds, I'm spinning 'round
And now you know why

'Cause no one in this world can make me feel loved
In the way that you wanna do now
No, no one in this world can make me come down
When I'm this so good, good mood now

Ooh, woo-hoo (Yeah, ayy, ooh)
A good mood
Oh, oh-oh
Ooh, woo-hoo
You make me feel good (Oh)
A good mood
Hey, ah, ooh, ooh
You make me in a good mood
Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Hey

Oh, oh-oh
You make me feel (Good mood)
Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh
You make me feel good (Ooh, woo-hoo)
A good mood
You make me (Ooh, woo-hoo)
Woo, a good mood
