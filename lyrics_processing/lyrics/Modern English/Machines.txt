There's no new past, there's no new sound
What would you do if they crumbled to the ground?
Wake up, you must be dreaming
Changes in our lives
We'll make it in the end
Machinery's broken in two
What are we to do?
Where were you when the day caved in?
It seems the streets were the place to be
Something quite disturbing filled the air
Wake up, you must be dreaming, quite an uneasy feeling
Machine fell down and smashed the ground
People cried for miles around
What about tomorrow? Someone said
Wake up, you must be dreaming, a quite uneasy feeling
Changes in our lives
We'll make it in the end
Machinery's broken in two
What are we to do?
Changes in our lives
We'll make it in the end
Machinery's broken in two
What are we to do?
