I got a hot rod car and you oughta see it run
I went out ridin' with a friend of mine we started passin' everybody way down the line
And I felt pretty good and boy we was havin' fun
Suddenly I didn't feel so fine cause a highway cop pulled up behind
So I asked my friend if the cop was after me
He just sat there shakin' all over like ol' Elvis Presley and said
Well if you don't know I ain't gonna tell you from now on it's up to you fellow
Words don't count at a time like this
There was a little blonde lived down on the corner
All the boys thought that she was a goner
So I got me a date and we went for a ride one night
We rolled along and I held her hand I felt just like a grown up man
Till she stood over close and hugged me up real tight
I started to stop to get out and run but I didn't wanna miss out on all the fun
So I asked her to teach me to spoon beneath the moon
She just looked up at me and winked them big beautiful blue eyes and said
Well if you don't know I ain't gonna tell you from now on it's up to you fellow
Words don't count at a time like this
Well I finally wised up and I learned all the tricks
And now I'm the coolest cat in the sticks
And I've got more gals than anybody else I know
I drink white lightnin' and I travel mighty far
I like pretty gals and souped up cars
I'm a travelling man and I'm always on the go
There's some bootleg liquor bein' sold in town
And the sheriff's been huntin' all around
But nobody knows who the manufacturer is
You ask me why I drive a hot rod coupe DeLuxe
With three carburetors straight stick ship souped up engine
High compression heads and overdrive hu
You don't know I ain't gonna tell you from now on it's up to you fellow
