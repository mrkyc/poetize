Took my car to my mechanic, I ain t seen it since
My phone is always ringin when I want to be alone
They try and sell me everything from Heaven to cologne
Everybody s got an offer I can t refuse
It s a circus out here momma
Your baby s got them Sideshow Blues
It s all a big commercial, it s a video of a man
It s a plot to put an end to my attention span
They make up all these issues, I never understood
If I thought I could change things I d run out to Hollywood
But it s hard to kick the door down wearing seven dollar shoes
It s a circus out here momma
Your baby s got them Sideshow Blues
I ve got them Sideshow Blues
I want to tame the lions
These center ring rich kids ain t even trying
From college to the big top they take the best positions
While I m out in this tent with these freaks and musicians
While I m out in this tent with these freaks and musicians
I m moaning them Sideshow Blues
I try to tell my girlfriend she s the only one that I ve got
This chick I hardly knows keeps on telling her she s not
She got a loaded pistol, she waves it all the time
Says, Sometimes you ve gotta kill a boy
To keep his ass in line
Well, that s the way she sees it, she says she saw it on the news
It s a circus out here momma
Your baby s got them Sideshow Blues
See people play satanic records, and you don t know when they ll freak
From quiet kid to maniac to movie of the week
We re killing over cocaine, dyin over sex
We re bowing down and praying to who ll ever cuts the check
When I go to church on Sunday, I can t help sleep in the pews
It s a circus out here momma
Your baby s got them Sideshow Blues
It s a circus out here momma
Your baby s got them Sideshow Blues
It s a circus out here momma
