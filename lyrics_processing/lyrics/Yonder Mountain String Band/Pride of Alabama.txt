Dixie was the pride of Alabama
I met her on a lonesome midnight train
Rollin' slowly out of Union Station
She was starin' out the window at the rain
Well Dixie was from sunny Alabama
That old steel rail would roll to Birmingham
Mobile, her final destination
I looked down at the ticket in her hand

Southbound train, it ain't you I know that done her wrong
Say again that you seen it comin' all along
All that she knew, those sweet memories, it's true
Dixie darlin' caught her southbound
Dixie darlin' caught her southbound train

Dixie asked if I'd been to Alabama
Her voice was thick like some old southern night
And maybe for the sake of conversation
I said back in '88 or '89
She said her daddy's fields were full of cotton
By the river that she swam in as a child
And how she loved those sweet magnolia blossoms
And that good old honeysuckle growin' wild

All that she knew, those sweet memories, it's true
Dixie darlin' caught her southbound
Dixie darlin' caught her southbound train

Dixie told me how she got to Denver
A southern gal who couldn't stand the cold
She fell in love and left Mobile forsaken
Mistaken for a dusty pot of gold
Dixie let the pieces fall together
And painted up this picture in my mind
Mobile, Alabama was a-callin' her back
And the Pride of Alabama was on time

Southbound train, it ain't you I know that done her wrong
Say again that you seen it comin' all along
All that she knew, those sweet memories, it's true
