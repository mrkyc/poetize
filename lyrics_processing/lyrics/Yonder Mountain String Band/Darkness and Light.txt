There was a soldier, there was a lady
There was a lover who lived in town
There was a battle in that far country
To that dark land was that old soldier bound
He held his true love, he kissed her softly
Said, "Darlin', fear not, I'll come back 'round."
From a near window, the lover watchin'
Watchin' as her tears fell to the ground
Nights grew cold, her heart grew lonely
Along the streets she would walk and she'd cry
Her heart was tender, her thoughts went yonder
She'd gently kiss the ring she'd wear upon her finger

Distance makes the heart grow fonder
But passion makes the fire bright
Loneliness and confusion
Darkness and light

One night while dreamin', she saw her true love
By an old rock wall, he sat a-weepin'
His eyes were shinin', his head turned skyward
Askin' God above, "How could this be?"
She jumped up from bed, her heart was poundin'
She went out to calm herself in the cool night air
She started roamin' by the edge of town
While the lover watched her go all alone
She soon grew weary, her body tired
By an old rock wall, she settled down
The lover approachin', approachin' gently
Lonely love was his favorite huntin' ground

The very next mornin', the lady risin'
She felt confusion like never before
She awoke in her own bed with a tender feelin'
Thought she heard the sound of her sweet soldier approachin'
A knock came upon the door, she jumped up runnin'
Only to see a strange soldier with medals a-shinin'
He said, "Sad lady, sad news I bring you
Your soldier died last night while the bullets were flyin'."
"No, no, no, this can't be, for just last evenin'
My soldier sang to me love's true song."
Wracked with confusion, she fell a-weepin'
While the lover from his window watched all along

Distance makes the heart grow fonder
But passion makes the fire bright
Loneliness and confusion
