I went ten miles out of my way
To a place I've heard about years ago
Another dead end
Don't matter anyway
Just keep rolling on and on
Head down, feet on the floor
Swear they can take you 'bout anywhere
Don't quit now, not far to go
Just keep rolling on and on

And when that wind rolls up, while hardly making a sound
Road turns from solid to rocky ground
Mountain high and river wide may lie between here and there
I may not know where I'm going
But I'll keep rolling on and on

I was ten weeks away from my home
Longer than I'd ever been before
I may not be learning anything
But it's too late to stop me now
I'm high, I'm hell bent
On what I'm doing
You may not see it through your eyes
Don't quit now, not far to go
Just keep rolling on and on

And when that wind rolls up, while hardly making a sound
Road turns from solid to rocky ground
Mountain high and river wide may lie between here and there
I may not know where I'm going
But I'll keep rolling on and on

(note: this changes from night to night...depending on my mood...subject to change at any moment..but this is what it is most of the time)
You may not see it coming
Even though it's in front of you
You may not want to admit it
Even though it's plain in view
You may not wanna know it
Even with your own two eyes
But i do swear, my friend, some day you'll have to recognize...


I was ten steps from my front door
I was ready to stop, now I'm not quite sure
Could it be only ten seconds more might show me what lies right around the bend?
Head down, feet on the floor
Swear they can take you 'bout anywhere
Don't quit now, not far to go
Just keep rolling on and on
And when that wind rolls up, while hardly making a sound
Road turns from solid to rocky ground
Mountain high and river wide may lie between here and there
I may not know where I'm going
