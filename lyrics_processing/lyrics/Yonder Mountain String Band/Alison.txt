I know a lover heaven-sent
From the world my eyes have turned, oh yeah
They fall, they fall, they fall, they fall, they fall on Alison
They fall, they fall, they fall, they fall, they fall on Alison
I saw her first in the summer shade
I was seein' things that my eyes had made
I could roll with all her friends, oh yeah
They talk, they talk, they talk, they talk, they talk on Alison
They talk, they talk, they talk, they talk, they talk on Alison

Everything has got a name
You can take or leave it, who's to blame
A-hounded all that's really there, oh yeah
You fall, you fall, you fall again, you fall for Alison
You fall, you fall, you fall again, you fall for Alison
I wouldn't say it's a mystery, what you do to me
I wouldn't say it's cruel
Play all night, play all day
Channeling the time I put into this hopelessness
That's all for you

I couldn't change my mind if I wanted to
I might make out and I might burn down, oh yeah
You fall, you fall, you fall, you fall, you fall for Alison
You fall, you fall, you fall, you fall, you fall for Alison
You fall, you fall, you fall, you fall, you fall for Alison
You fall, you fall, you fall, you fall, you fall for Alison
You fall, you fall, you fall, you fall
You fall, you fall, you fall, you fall
You fall, you fall, you fall, you fall
