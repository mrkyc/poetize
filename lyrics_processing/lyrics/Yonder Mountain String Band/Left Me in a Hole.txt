A divorcee goes to the bar
A sophisticate pulls up in his car
A hopeful youth waits for the first star to come out
The sky above can be so mean
The clouds cover what should be seen
And there ain't much left too keen in my book

Hangin' on to someone else
He tells you that peace sells
And you see it like all's well, I ain't jealous
Though you used to listen to me
My inner thoughts have made you flee
I know you were just tryin' to be what you want to be

I let you in to see me for real
And you walked right out, that's what I feel
You said you needed time to be alone

And like the youth, I looked above
Feeling stranded without love
The time was wrong, and you left me in a hole
You left me in a hole, you left me in a hole
You left me in a hole

The rain it comes, the rain it goes
The question is she friend or foe?
The storyteller looks to his toes, he's stuck here
The dragon's breath is on my neck
Which way is home? Hold on a sec
The bartender put a bottle of beer on the table

Many people, they believe
That Jesus came here to relieve
All the problems that we breathe on each other
And I don't care just what you do
Or what you think, that's up to you
You see, those thoughts of yours aren't new to me at all

Is it these thoughts that made you believe
That there's nothin' here, so you shall leave
While I sit here with my guitar in my hand?

And like the youth, I looked above
Feelin' stranded without love
The time was wrong, and you left me in a hole
You left me in a hole, you left me in a hole
You left me in a hole
A hungry baby starts to cry
An old man's about to die
And all I can do is sit back and sigh, "What's my problem?"
"Ignore the problem, that's the key,"
Said the woman beneath the tree
If your eyes are closed, you can't see the sunrise

The phone, it rings, who could it be?
It ain't her, and it's not for me
Forgetting's as easy as one-two-three, my friends say
But her face is still all too clear
Her leavin' me was my biggest fear
Something's got to help me steer away from her

Well you have your life, and I have mine
Maybe we'll meet again some other time
Down the long road, on another plain

And like the youth, I looked above
Feelin' stranded without love
The time was wrong, and you left me in a hole
You left me in a hole, you left me in a hole
You left me in a hole, you left me in a hole
You left me in a hole, you left me in a hole
You left me in a hole
You left me in a hole
You left me in a hole
You left me in a hole
