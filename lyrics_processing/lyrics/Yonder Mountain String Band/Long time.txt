I see you sitting there
And I hope that today will be the day, nothing to fear
And I've told myself so many times to wait for it to come
But if I wait too long, I may forget you
Often times I'll analyze and criticize in my mind
Telling friends that this nonsense can't be what they want to hear
But at least they have something to say
My own mind will ring in dull
That's why if I wait too long, I may forget you
It's been such a long time
I know it's sad but true
Such a long time
Since I've had something to say
Such a long time
I don't even know what I'm even looking for
How can I find what I cannot see?
If I wait too long, I may forget you
(interlude)
Lately it seems that I've been thinking 'bout you every day
But I can't seem to get the courage to open up to you
And I bet that if I can, things would be better I am sure
That's why if I wait too long, I may forget you

I know it's sad but true
Such a long time
Since I've had something to say
Such a long time
Now that I've found what's been stuck in my mind
I promise I will be back real soon
If I wait too long, I may forget you
(short interlude)
It's been such a long time
I know it's sad but true
Such a long time
Since I've had something to say
Such a long time
Now that I've found what's been stuck in my mind
I promise I will be back real soon
