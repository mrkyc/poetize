There's a house somewhere I know where the fire's burnin'
All night long
There's a swing outside on the porch where I feel I could
Rock away the dusk 'til the dawn
And even though the wind may now be howlin'
The stars are bright and they push me on and on

There's a half moon risin' in southeastern skies
There's a cold wind blowin' across the great divide
And the stars, they guide my way across the night
There's a half moon risin'
Pushin' me on over another mountaintop
Push me on, no, I'll never stop, push me on
There's a half moon risin' in southeastern skies tonight

Now the shoes on my feet, those soles are broken down
And my coat is tattered and worn
And the hunger in my belly and the fever in my head
Will vanish at my first glimpse of home
And even though the rain may now be fallin'
The passion is deep, it pushes me on

There's a half moon risin' in southeastern skies
There's a cold wind blowin' across the great divide
And the stars, they guide my way across the night
There's a half moon risin'
Pushin' me on over another mountaintop
Push me on, no, I'll never stop, push me on
There's a half moon risin' in southeastern skies tonight

There's a still at dawn like the sound of your love's breath
As she lies sleepin'
Down below me now in the valley is the only peace on earth
That I ever want to know
And her lips are as soft as I remember
She alone has brought me back on home

There's a half moon risin' in southeastern skies
There's a cold wind blowin' across the great divide
And the stars, they guide my way across the night
There's a half moon risin'
Pushin' me on over another mountaintop
Push me on, no, I'll never stop, push me on
