See we still young but we old enough
To know whats up they notice us
We flashy, we shine hard
They coming up short like nine yards
My girl here and she with me til we 6 feet deep
And she party all the time I swear this chick don't sleep
Well thats fine with me, im cool with that
Pants off, booty clap
Hands off thats what she said
5 minutes later she was in my bed
It easy to convince em when your young and on a mission
She fuckin w my mindset and she told me that I'm different
Ya she told me that I'm next up and I know when these checks come
My ex friends are out here tryna front like they my bests ones
But fuck that, got her on her knees like a touch back
And fuck rap, shout out to you groupies and you club rats
You know who you are lose the bra
Let me see the real you, nice calves I like what them heels do oh
You know what it is cut the shit got you covered in some high fasion see
From the cover of the magazine


Oh Oh Oh baby dont you stop, take you to the club and let me show you off
Yeah we getting everybody jealous we could do it for the night or we could do it
Do it forever
You might also likeDo it forever x 4

Now let that music get inside of your veins
Feel free baby use the right side of your brain
Let me show you the bigger picture like a fish lens
If thats your man he should wonder where his chick went
Well, we out in london right be Big Ben
Driving round in a big Benz I'll pick you up when your shift ends
I'll take you, I'll show you off
You look like a model, without the photoshoop
Got every girl wishing that they were you
Ima go home smelling just like your perfume
Word to, all them hatin' hoes
Tell him cut the shit like they were baking soda
Throwing them drinks back I swear this shit taste like water
Ya we crushing them shits call us pestle and mortar
I keep bad girls around you could call me a hoarder
But this girl is the baddest i swear you couldn't afford her

Oh Oh Oh baby dont you stop, take you to the club and let me show you off
Yeah we getting everybody jealous we could do it for the night or we could do it
