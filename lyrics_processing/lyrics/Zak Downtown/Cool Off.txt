I'm blacked out from my new clothes to my skin tone
High brow from my eyebrows to my iPhone
Broke off, I'm the tomcat in the bar
With two blondes and the door slightly ajar
We on a high roll, betting on red six
Kissing chubby women, no ass and fake tits
My ex girl told me I'm wack and ain't shit
So I pooed in her food, guess she ate shit

Rule number one, never be number two
I'mma make money, player, boy what're you?
Got 37 girls all coming through
Me and Bryce Vine on the track, they on trouble, whoo
I make my own wave and I surf it
I look real nice on the surface
But if you're playing with my commas
I know goons uptown that can come with the drama

You need to cool off
Talking all that shit you need to cool off
It's getting hot in here, you need to cool off
For real though, I ain't in the mood, dog
So you need to - cool, cool off
Talking all that shit you need to cool off
It's getting hot in here, you need to cool off
For real though, I ain't in the mood, dog

Yeah, me and Zachary down for town hoes
Down for down women who loud and lack clothes
Pound for pound chickens I'm crowned the best nigga in town
My mama say I'm making her proud
I'm a one-hit wonder
I hit it once and you wonder where I went
And if the pot gets cold before I get home
It's on you to pay my rent

I can see our peers getting jealous
Out here on the road getting money with my fellas
Yeah, we hear you talking, we don't care what you tell us
Got your girl right here, trying to show us her melons
Like, eh, that's an every night occasion
Drop one hit and we got everybody waiting
House in the hills, got the girls half naked
Take a pic so I can show my mama I made it
