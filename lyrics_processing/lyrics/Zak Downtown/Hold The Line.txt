Hello
Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh my
Real G's never die, we only multiply
They see me in my zone, they tryna' kill my high
They blowin' up my phone, hold the line (br, br)
Hold the line (br, br)
Hold the line  (hold the line)
They blowin' up my phone, hold the line (stop blowin' up my shit)
I'm tryna' find some piece of mind
But they blowin' up my phone, hold the line

Okay, they blowin' up my phone again
I'm just rollin' doljamin
Plottin' on these millions
But you already know the plan
Sippin' somethin' strong
'Cause my days are way too long
Fell asleep in Paris and I woke up in Malone
'Cause I'm a young, fly, jiggy motherfucker you know it
I'm what happens when you mix a real G wit' a poet
Get a hundred thousand plays every time we upload it
I been hustlin' for years, record sales are a bonus
Huh

Uh, hello, is this Zak Downtown?
Hello?
Hey can you, uh, check out my new song on SoundCloud?

Listen you, I'm tellin' ya'
They blowin' up my cellular
And I dont fuck with bitches if they regular
I can be in Europe, out in Asia or America
Anywhere I go I hit the stage, you know I tear it up (tear it up)
Real talk, I don't talk much
But I listen close and you all suck
I been comin' up with a master plan
So my hands covered in chalk dust
Like uh

Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh my
Real G's never die, we only multiply
They see me in my zone, they tryna' kill my high
They blowin' up my phone, hold the line (br, br)
Hold the line (br, br)
Hold the line  (hold the line)
They blowin' up my phone, hold the line (stop blowin' up my shit)
I'm tryna' find some piece of mind
But they blowin' up my phone, hold the line
I got money comin' in and I got money goin'
I got money gettin' big, swear I can't even fold it
Had a little extra money, told your girl to hold it
Now that ain't your girl no more, she just got stolen
Damn (damn)
Oh shit, look at me now
Hop on the stage and I'm rockin' the crowd
Gettin' so high like we up in the clouds
Anthony Davis, I'm blockin' you out
Look, I get it
You don't like it 'cause I'm winnin'
But as long as Earth is spinnin'
I'mma keep doin' my thing and
I wrote this in a minute, my mind is on some next shit
When you hit the stage everyone heads toward the exit
You sour like some lemons, I just squeeze that in my vodka
Records flyin' out like NASA and your shit be doin' nada', bitch

Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh my
Real G's never die, we only multiply
They see me in my zone, they tryna' kill my high
They blowin' up my phone, hold the line (br, br)
Hold the line (br, br)
Hold the line  (hold the line)
They blowin' up my phone, hold the line (stop blowin' up my shit)
I'm tryna' find some piece of mind
