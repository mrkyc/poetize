The Time is now, The City's Ours
I'm coming I'm coming, I'm coming, coming hard
A Star is Born, I go hard for
1 mil, 2 mil, 3 mil I need far more

See that glory that we went for ain't meant for anyone
I drop by hot 97 place give flex the tape say let it run
You know where I get it from, my city boy that's NY
I'm different like tity boi I'm at Joes Pizza getting fresh pies
I light up like my city does, feeling just like 50 was
On get rich or die tryin man and I'm sizzling like a frying pan
I go hard, like why not, got one vision like a cyclops
That's make money, get paper, fuck bitches get gwap
No more waiting at the bus stop, more like pull that benz out
No sleeping on my friends couch more like whats that thread count
If it ain't like a G I ain't sleeping on it fam
Let me tell your ass again breaking even ain't the plan

The Time is now, The City's Ours
I'm coming I'm coming, I'm coming, coming hard
A Star is Born, I go hard for
1 mil, 2 mil, 3 mil I need far more

The Time is now, The City's Ours
I'm coming I'm coming, I'm coming, coming hard
A Star is Born, I go hard for
