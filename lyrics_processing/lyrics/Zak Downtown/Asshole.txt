Imma asshole, she say imma asshole
But I don't give a fuck about my last hoe
She say I need to get a grasp though
So i grab her by the ass yo
Imma asshole she say imma asshole
I dont I dont I dont give a fuck about my last hoe
Why you being bashful?
You know you love it when I grab you by the ass though

Clear liquor in my system
Clear head on my shoulders
Imma get some clear diamonds same size as a boulder
I wake up to some pussy, I don't wake up to Folgers'
I told her give me that sloppy but just watch out for them molars
Your girl got me on the poster and she told me come over
When you was nappin' i was wiping off her back with a napkin
That's what happens when you slackin' boy
Step it up
I ain't slept enough
I been up on the grind from 9 to 5 and 5 to 9
Are you mad though?
Do you hate me?
Talkin' that shit but i know that you still wanna date me
Do you love me?
Wanna try it again?
You know that you love me forever but go ahead lie to your friends
They say that money is power
Well I get paid every hour
If you don't like it why you bent over my kitchen counter
And I'm still on that sour
It's so loud you can hear it
I'm going deep in that endzone
I'm callin' ass interference
They said "boy go to school!"
But i never went to class
Had a low GPA
But I got plenty ass
I ain't a role model
But I'm rollin' with models
No you can't be my housewife
But yes i always get bravo-ed
I told her clap clap
When you see me make that ass drop (drop)
You might also likeI don't give a fuck about my last thot
You see I'm workin' like I have not
Til' we have lots and we do it big like caps lock
Take your hats off!
