And we did it (And we did it), first class now, no economy tickets (No)
In the stool, let it kitchen (Let it kitchen)
TK on the beat so you know that shit kickin' (You know that shit kickin')
And we still ain't change the vision
Never trippin' about my passport, say somethin' different
If you never seen the top, you ain't know watchu missin'
She gon' suck me every Sunday like my dick a religion (Woo)

Still ridin' around with the same old set

And I still ridin' around with the same old set

Took a little break but we back now (But we back now)
Icon in my city you can ask around (You can ask around)
TK like penny with the passnote (Pew)
Downtown throw it down like sheckdown
Break the glass, when this common she shake her ass (She shake her ass)
Hey, listen ma'am I already saw it on Instagram (Ayy!)
I hope that might break the tension (Ayy!)
You already got my attention (Ayy!)
Too much loud pack at my session
Make me feel like we the Jacksons
How high is too high
Ten mil streams, yea I did that two times (Did it twice)
Got a few more up my sleeve
Drop the top so you can feel the breeze (Skrr)
