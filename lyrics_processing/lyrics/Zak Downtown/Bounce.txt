Lately I've doing shit differently
Cooking like a chef I've been all up in the kitchen
Had to make a move, had to make a little distance
A lot of people tripping they can't never see division

Fuck that till I'm bounce
If they never see the ounce
Instead of raw
All you need rewind
Hit me up
I know who to call
I don't do the mall
Life thing cut (That shit is gone)
Shorty ass-pect Yes shes doing lounges
I'm in L.A. tak'in me is doing lunches
Five star so you know that shit is scrumptious
And it's fuck your assumptions
This ain't what you thought
It was and what you hope that was it

I feel like
I feel like
I'm the only one left (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one left (I'm the only one left)
And that's why
That's why
That's why
That's why

They said they need to cut the cheque (Yeah, they need to cut the cheque)
