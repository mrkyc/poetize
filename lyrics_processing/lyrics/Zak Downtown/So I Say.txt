I woke up late, and put my gold on
Last night was great, them drinks were so strong
My head it aches, I need to roll one
My wifeys calling me, I told her hold on
I'm in the hotel suite, I got my robe on
I got my mojo back, that shit is so on
Let's go for round two, or round three, or round four
You know I'm down, for anything your down for
Eh

Okay thou
 so high that we make dough
Zips of the kush and that haze thou
Henny and Remmy and J-Mo
It's only my people that sit at my table
Model bitches on that Adderall
I take it too, I ain't mad at y'all
When I'm on tour I get no sleep
Turn up, turn up with the whole team
Gold teeth, matching watch
Making money, stacking guap
Summer time, gotta flex now
20 girls in the guest house
I watch them kiss on eachother
And I start to feel so left out
You might also like
And so I say...
Low-key you look like you might be the one
So I say...
All of this liquor mixing got me drunk
So I say...
Let's get the fuck out the club
Get all your friends in the back of the truck
If we ain't got room we make room
And go back to the room and we turn this bitch up
(T-t-turn up)

I woke up late, and put my gold on
Last night was great, them drinks were so strong
My head it aches, I need to roll one
My wifeys calling me, I told her hold on
I'm in the hotel suite, I got my robe on
I got my mojo back, that shit is so warm
Let's go for round two, or round three, or round four
You know I'm down, for anything your down for
Eh

Okay thou
Last night we had a blast
I spent like all of my cash
I do a show and I make it right back
And I'm self employed, I don't give nobody 
She look like she might be Dominican
I said we got some drinks we should finish them
Why are you acting so innocent
'Cause I know that you like to get it in
Drop it down girl and shake something
You ain't even gotta say nothing
I kind of like it when you play dumb
I got some pills, you can take one
What's up in the restroom
I know you ain't fixing your make up
And so I say...
We should head out and go back to the crib
So I say...
All of this liquor mixing got me lit
So I say...
Let's get the fuck out this spot
Get all your girls in the back of the drop
If we ain't got room we make room
And go back to the room and we make this bitch hot

I woke up late, and put my gold on
Last night was great, them drinks were so strong
