Black Label break it out, two girls making out
Yeah its 5 am but thats that shit that make me stay around
Ima wait it out, see what unfolds
You thnk you doing it like us but you dont come close
Got 100 bad girls in the front row
I can't even tell you what I'm 'bout to get for one show
Wow, I was never one cop icy shit
But im thinking that jacob should go and liscense this


Got a Milly in the bank fuck what everybody Thank
I got (yellow diamonds in my chain)
If they hatin let em hate im buying everybody dranks

Young reckless almost famous
You know my shit banging
Anything I spend comes back call it boomeranging
It's a new arrangement, im in charge
Might cop a new Mercedes and peel off
For real dawg if I dont know you, I dont owe you
And I think I got a chance with every girl I saw hello to
And I drove through your city, did a show and got faded
Got a couple of death threats thats how you know that we made it

Shorty right here well her skirts getting high
I remember she the reason why I work all the time
Then she falls in my lap
Gave me her number told her baby I can't promise that im calling you back
Now she wanna come, back stage, rage with her fav, after party got, wild 
Well I'll pay for the maids
Dont pay for the spades, the champagnes comped
Go through so many rounds that i barely could walk

Got a Milly in the bank fuck what everybody Thank
I got (yellow diamonds in my chain)
If they hatin let um hate im buying everybody dranks

I'm not on the scene, I run the scene
I carefully choose my company
Pop bubbly with girls that I'll never see again
If I did it wouldn't matter cause my memory is spent
I mean last year feels like last week and I dont know where last week went
Now I spend my days, getting paid, tear it up likes perferated
Yup its perfect ain't it
The way I came up
From absolutely nothing
Now I'm bagging cuties and stunting I'm packing my Louie luggage
