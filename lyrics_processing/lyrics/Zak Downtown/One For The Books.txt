But we probably won't remember what happened
Cuz all of this liquor mixed with this weed
Got me on my feet on the couch wilding out
This is one for the books, just look
But we probably won't remember what happened
Cuz all of this liquor mixed with this weed
Got me on my feet on the couch wilding out
Let me set the scene up: vodka and Pellegrino
My homies rolling weed up, and we listening to Primo
Or a little bit of dealer shit, 3 or 4 vanilla chicks
And I've been saving money so I could go to the dealership
I know they feeling me tho, they won't leave me alone
And they going through my bars like a field goal
Don't be mad that I moved out my mom's
And I pulled down a few hundred thongs
And I'm finally getting love from the Bronx
So I quit my day job and just made watch
Young David Hasselhoff
Puff, pass, cough, I fill up my lungs in my chest
We looking zuited, hope we don't get approached by the press
I guess I'm next yes, fuck what they've been telling me
I don't need an L.A. Reid
I'm living large like Heavy D
Tonight we making memories, forever we have this moment
So grab a Kodak, make some poses, keep that liquor flowing

Cuz all of this liquor mixed with this weed
Got me on my feet on the couch wilding out
All this liquor got me feeling warm
We up in here being form
Bottle count: three or four
In the cut like Neosporin
We gon have a night for the ages
No special occasion, just because we can
We don't need a fucking plan
On top of that I earned this all
First, second, and third of all
I don't need an explanation, I exceed all expectations
Never get complacent, money moving like a armored truck
We don't need to bargain hunt, getting bread carb-ing up
Im up up and at 'em, got my molecules moving
Bout to ditch my old chick
See how some of them girls doing
Money talks I'm getting fluent
Daily Shows like I'm Jon Stewart
And they say I got a bad case of hubris, true shit
Is it rude if what I only want is Friends With Benefits
That look like Mila Kunis, yeah I'm choosy
Want them Sooner like I play for Oklahoma
Right now I'm in my Zona
We some Wildcats piling cash
This is one for the books, just look
