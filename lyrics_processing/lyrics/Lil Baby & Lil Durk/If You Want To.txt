Ain't nobody bigger than this shit
That shit be script (Ahahaha)
Ayy, Baby, I told you, bruh, do you hear me?
Doin' four hundred first week, nigga

We beat the odds, got it poppin', this shit ain't usual
When everybody want something, feel like they usin' you
I wanna turn up some more, but for what? I keep it cool
I'm startin' to feel like a god, I'm like, "What would Jesus do?"
You got a piece of me forever, I can't never leave you
Can't go back and forth with no one, I know what that lead to
Told me you want some space for shit, I wanna breathe too
I can't go back to my neighborhood no more, I breeze through

I had to sleep with my gun when I was booked, I wanted to sleep with my son
Parole board had a grip on my bond, I couldn't dip
But she was broke, but the hood knew her well, she couldn't strip
Plus ain't no type of scam in this world she couldn't flip
Ain't no type of lean in this world I couldn't sip
I beef with my cousin, we catch him, it's fuck him
He fuck with the other side, he gettin' killed
He fuck with the other side, he gettin' killed
I'ma speak for everybody who ain't gotta wait, get 'em
And if I say a number, and you ain't got a way, cashier
I done got bigger and richer than last year
I don't fuck with too many niggas from last year
Bond him out for fifty thousand cash, I use the cashier
And I was in city, got the time, I got mad tears
Whatever go up must come down, ferris wheel
He ain't buy a gun, but he'd rather buy Chanel heels

Yeah, police get behind me, then I better not stop
Binary trigger on the AR, not stock
We don't never post, but we be makin' TikToks
Why you don't be in the hood no more? That shit hot, yeah
Niggas really thinkin' they can catch up with me
That is not my bitch if she ain't rockin' Richard Millies
Just because you got the same kind of car, we not the same kind
I just had two best friends tryna suck me at the same time
Damn, I miss them houses in the hood, we used to trap 'em out
The only reason we ain't on your ass 'cause you was tappin' out
My opps just went to jail, I paid the bros to go and pap 'em out
Four hundred a show, ain't nothin' less, I bet I pack it out
Catch him out in traffic, gotta ask him what them captions 'bout
Internet gangsters, y'all just actin' out
They made jokes when I was broke, look at who laughin' now
I'm gettin' too big for all these chains, I gotta pass 'em down
I'm tryna turn up all the killers, ain't tryna crash 'em out
Ain't got no credit, I need to get some, I be cashin' out
You with the bitch because she lit, she gettin' passed around
I know some niggas who look rich but buyin' a couple pounds
Stop all that huffin' and that puffin' 'fore we blow you down
I got six pipes on this G-Wagen, this bitch super loud
Turks & Caicos, scuba divin', vacation three hundred thousand
I'm the headliner now, I might jump off in the crowd

And you can do what you want to
