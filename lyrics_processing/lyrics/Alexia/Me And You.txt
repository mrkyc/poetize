Nobody close to me just you
You have the power in your eyes
Me and you
Today you left me far behind
How could I live without you tell me now
Forever waiting for your love

Me and you
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
You got the sun let it shine on me
Can't get away don't forget my tears
This is the way I feel good
Give me a reason to come back to you
Fire's still burning inside of me
Feels so long with my shattered dream
I try so hard stronger than free
Why don't you want to recall what could be

Me and you
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
You might also likeLost and afraid you're a light for me
Open my heart wash away my fears
If I'm scared you'll take me to
A brighter place where I can run to you
If you could only believe in me
There's nothing else to do can't you see
If you feel the way I live for two
We could be in heaven and our dream will come true

Me and you
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala

One day you came and made me blue
Nobody close to me just you
You have the power in your eyes
Me and you
Today you left me far behind
How could I live without you tell me now
Forever waiting for your love
Me and you
Uh baby baby it has to be love spinning me round and round
Me and you
Uh baby baby it has to be love spinning me round and round
Me and you
Uh baby baby it has to be love spinning me round and round
Me and you
Uh baby baby it has to be love spinning me and you
Me and you
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
