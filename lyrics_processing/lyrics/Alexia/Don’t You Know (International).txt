You come back to me
Over and over
Holding out on me
Now nothing comes my way
Oh Lord help me please
Do you hear me calling
Listen to my prayer...
Don't you know we've got to fight to save our life from the heartache
We were born to love each over hand in hand not be lonely
Hey you, don't you understand
You belong to me my man
Come on move and set me free!
What the hell this is all on me

Didn't know you can steal my soul
Shut up now baby , and I will tell you all about it :
You better tell it to my face

We were born to love each over hand in hand not be lonely
Hand in Hand till the end
