I need somebody to take this blues away
I've got to call my friends
We need to have some fun
We gonna have a party, we just wanna dance...
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
Hey you! You've got to come my friend
We have got all friday night to spend
Come on, we've got to make a plan
Gotta a thing running through my head
I - I wanna lose control
Big time's gonna take my soul
Hey - we gotta move and groove and fall into the party
There's nothing else that I can do
When music starts, on friday night
I go insane my baby
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
You might also likeIf you , you wanna find a man
You better try to understand
Hey baby, you gotta free your soul
When you dance you can see your goal
Hey why don't you look at me?
This is how you need to be
Yeah,I know the way to take
Your heart moving my body!
It's just the way to have some fun
Never break my heart
It's friday night, I'm going crazy!
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
Don't you know this is no party
