I'm hanging on to you to letting go my pain
I'm begging you to stay ?cause I'm hungry of your love
Waiting for so long with my head between my hands
I felt as touched the ground every time you treat me bad

Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye
Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye

I wonder to myself, if I were free to leave
'Cause you did that to me a thousand times and back again
I was always there for you and ready to forgive
But your heart is made of steel, keep on turning me around

Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye
Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye

'Cause you're my lovely and I live for you
The way you smile, the way you are, I wanna hold you by my side
The way you touch me, the way you groove me
The way you smile, the way you are, I wanna hold you by my side

Oh, oh, I'm hanging on, oh yeah
I keep on hanging on to you, baby

Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye
Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye

'Cause you're my lovely and I live for you
The way you smile, the way you are, I wanna hold you by my side
The way you touch me, the way you groove me
The way you smile, the way you are, I wanna hold you by my side
