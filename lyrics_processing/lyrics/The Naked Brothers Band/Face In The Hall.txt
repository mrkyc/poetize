So I'd run for cover, run for cover
I feel better knowin' it's all over
And I'm free to be who I wanna be
You make somethin' just turn into nothin'
That's what you do, what you always do
Just blendin' in, I know it's a sin
But I'm forgettin' you, forgettin' you
You used to mean so much
But everything has changed
You had your chance
Now watch it fade away
Just a face in the hall
You used to mean it all to me
Just a face in the hall
Now it's all gone you see
Time's a pain, now soon to be over
And the girl I knew, well I don't even know her
And what we had is thrown away
And all my demons were kept to play
You used to mean so much
But everything has changed
You had your chance
Now watch it fade away
You might also likeJust a face in the hall
You used to mean it all to me
Just a face in the hall
Now it's all gone you see
Just a face in the hall
The place dead and an awkward calm
I wasn't able to say this to you
That's why I wrote this song
After all that we've been through
It's better that you're gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
You used to mean so much
But everything has changed
You had your chance
Now watch it fade away
Just a face in the
Just a face in the hall
You used to mean it all to me
Just a face in the hall
Now it's all gone you see
Just a face in the hall
You used to mean it all to me
Just a face in the hall
The place dead and an awkward calm
Just a face in the
Just a face in the
