Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Grab your suitcase, pack your bag
And you're obviously lost
And the sun will help you out
In the depths of your despair
When you're down and all about
You can remember what I said
On top of the world but what you see
Is not what's in your
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Take me from this horrid land
Give me something worth a smile
And if you fail to find me there
I will wait here for a while
You might also likeAnd if you're blinded by the light
Left alone in the cold, cold world
Just remember what I told you
The sun will always guide
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Through with practicality
And the demons grieve, whoa
Face reality and you plainly see, whoa
And the, and the, and the, and the
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
Eventually, eventually
And the sun will find us all
