You so fire
Come on in and take off your coat
It's rainin' outside and all your clothes are soaked
All your clothes are soaked
Would like me to get you a drink?
Would you like me to put your shirt and your pants
In my washin' machine, in my washin' machine?
Don't worry I got a top that you can have
Make yourself at home boy, just relax
Give me 5 minutes and I'll be back
So I can hit that, hit that, hit that
(Chorus 2x)
I'd be a liar, if i said that you wasn't fire
You know I keeps it real
Showin' you what's the deal
'cause you the only one that I feel
Five minutes is up, so I head back
I can't see a damn thing, 'cause it's pitch black
So I turn to my left, 'cause I hear a noise
Comin' close to my ear, I hear a voice
A voice that says, if I move he gon' make it hurt
So I lift my arms, while he takes my shirt
You do it hard, but you never make it hurt
It's like havin' a seizure, while you put in work
You might also like(Chorus 2x)
I'd be a liar, if i said that you wasn't fire
You know I keeps it real
Showin' you what's the deal
'cause you the only one that I feel
You in all my thoughts
And all my dreams
You the only man in my life
That's made me cream, that's made me cream
When you hit my spot
You make me shake
From my fingertips, all the way to my legs
It's funny, 'cause I can't even move
I can't understand how you do the things you do
You so fire
You so fire
(Chorus 2x)
I'd be a liar, if i said that you wasn't fire
You know I keeps it real
Showin' you what's the deal
