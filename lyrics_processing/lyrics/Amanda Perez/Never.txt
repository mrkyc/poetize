Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

You walked into my life, when I was down and out
Took away my pain and gave me your smile
And at the time, still lovin' someone else
Not knowin' why 'cause they were the reason
Why I felt the way I felt
And then one day I realized
That you were the one for me
I was so blind, but baby, now I see

And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Would you spend the rest of your life with me?
'Cause I'll never play
Wanna let you go
No, I'll never play
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
'Cause if I would've knew your love was like this
Back then I would've made you mine, oh yeah
If I had to die a thousand times a day
I would do it for you, just to take
The pain that I have given you away
Cause I love you and I never want to let you go
You might also like
And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Would you spend the rest of your life with me?
'Cause I'll never play
Wanna let you go
No, I'll never play
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

I'm sorry (Oh, yes I am)
I'm sorry (I'm so sorry, baby)

And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Would you spend the rest of your life with me?
'Cause I'll never play
Wanna let you go
No, I'll never play
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Would you spend the rest of your life with me?
'Cause I'll never play
Wanna let you go
No, I'll never play
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
