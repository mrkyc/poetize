In my life
In my life

Every time I see you
I lose my cool
Going out my mind
'Cause I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Look at your sexy body
Every night I go to sleep
I want you to be the one right beside me

Boy, need you in my life
Boy, need you
I be the one thats down to do or die
Wipe away your tears, when you feel the need to cry
Loving you without no lies
'Cause I need you in my life

There are times that I'm with you
All I wanna do is touch you
And if you let me
Ill promise that Ill always love you
'Cause I need you in my life
You might also like
I be the one that's down to do or die
Wipe away your tears when you feel the need to cry
Loving you without no lies
'Cause I need you in my life
Boy, need you in my life
Boy, need you (Need you in my life)
Boy, need you in my life
Boy, need you

I need you in my life
You can be my man
I can be your wife
Show you things that you've never seen before
Turn off the lights, close the door
Kiss you all on your neck
Putting your body all in check
Nothing but love, no disrespect
Boy, you ain't seen nothing yet
I be the one that be by your side
Loving you to the day that I die
Giving good loving that make you cry
I can be bonnie, you can be Clyde
Jump in your ride
Hit your switches side to side
'Cause I need a man like you in my life
Now you tell me what it'll be like
Tell me tell me what it'll be like
Let's ride, 'cause I need you in my life
