Tonight your body is mine boy why u gotta be lookin so fine
With ur body looking sexy i want u to come and caress me
Boy i ain't wasting no time 'cause tonight ur body's mine
Tonight ur body is mine boy why u gotta be looking so fine
With ur body looking sexy i want u to come and caress me
Uhh i'll touch u all of ur body where the good lovers touch
It might but i guarentee it'll make u blush
I'll run my fingers through your hair
Touch u on your body 'cause i know u don't care
And if u want a key i'll guarentee that i'll be there
We can dive by the ocean
Pull over and i'll rub u with lotion that's my devotion
To fill your emotion enter the AP love potion
Boy ain't nothing wrong with a little bump and grind we can do this on the 50 yard line cuz tonight your body is mine
