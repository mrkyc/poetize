We was geared from head to toe, we were lookin' so tight
The moment I leave his side
She tries to creep up from behind, I seen her with mah own eyes
Why you tryin' to lie? There's plenty of other guys
Why you gotta fuck with mine?
See hoes like you get fucked up after the club
It's on an that's what's up
Go 'head and look, yeah I know he's fine
Try to run up but he's already mine
When he looks at you, he laughs in your face
Silly hoes you should know, you could never take mah place
Go 'head and flaunt and drop it like it's hot
No matter what you do, he'll forget me not
Don't try to be sneaky and keep it on the low
You should already know to him, you're just another hoe
She said, "What you mean, I came to the bar to get me a drink"
Shit you was on mah man, faster than I can blink
What you think, I'm a fool so you think
He's gone leave me to be wit you
You and average chick
Stop ridin' him like he was yours, 'fore I cock back
My hand and bust your lip, it will be a one way trip
It's your last and this is it
Go 'head and look, yeah I know he's fine
Try to run up but he's already mine
When he looks at you, he laughs in your face
Silly hoes you should know, you could never take mah place
Go 'head and flaunt and drop it like it's hot
No matter what you do, he'll forget me not
Don't try to be sneaky and keep it on the low
You should already know to him, you're just another hoe
For all my ladies out there
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
If you've got a good man
You better look out
'Cause what you got is what they want
Tell them hoes they better push on
They on a mission, better listen to what I say
'Cause these hoes get 'round everyday
Go 'head and look, yeah I know he's fine
Try to run up but he's already mine
When he looks at you, he laughs in your face
Silly hoes you should know, you could never take mah place
Go 'head and flaunt and drop it like it's hot
No matter what you do, he'll forget me not
Don't try to be sneaky and keep it on the low
You should already know to him, you're just another hoe
Go 'head and look, yeah I know he's fine
Try to run up but he's already mine
When he looks at you, he laughs in your face
Silly hoes you should know, you could never take mah place
Go 'head and flaunt and drop it like it's hot
No matter what you do, he'll forget me not
Don't try to be sneaky and keep it on the low
