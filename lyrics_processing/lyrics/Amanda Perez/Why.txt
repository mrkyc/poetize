I need everybody all around the world to listen
I'm gonna talk about what people have a hard time talkin' about
Pay close attention

Many days I done cried myself to sleep
Many days I done asked God to take me
'Cause I knew I was goin down the wrong road
Didn't nobody care, ain't wanna know
Got a bottle of pills, filled to the top
Now I don't care about life, **** let it stop
Twenty-five years old and I'm losing my mind
Tryna take these pills to take my life

Oh why, why do I feel this way in my life?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And I can't lie
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna breakdown and cry
Why?

Single mom wit' her five kids, And I
Still thinkin' to myself tell me what it is?
Why you stay with a dude that stay locked up?
You know he got hella hoes and they stay knocked up
Tell me why you keep givin him a chance?
'Cause baby girl, you know he ain't a good man
You might also like
Oh why, why do I feel this way in my life?
Tell me, can you tell me?
And I can't lie
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna breakdown and cry
Why?

Quick to cock back ya hand and call her a bitch
You the man of the house, yeah you think you the ****
Who you call when you feel like you're down in the dirt?
Who you call when you're feeling all the pain and hurt?
And who you call when your pockets run low, and
You can't find the **** to put in your arm no more?
Man, I see boy, you're lost to the world
You forgot about your son, and your baby girl

Oh why, why do I feel this way in my life?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And I can't lie (I can't lie)
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna breakdown and cry (Sometimes I feel like I wanna breakdown, just breakdown and cry, ooh)
Oh why, why do I feel this way in my life?
And I can't lie
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna breakdown and cry
