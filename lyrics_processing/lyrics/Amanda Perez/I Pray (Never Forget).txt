I pray to god i dont forget who you are you mean everything to me..
I love you
Your were in my dreams before i even knew there was a you and me
Now i can't wait till i see your smile when i wake up each day
It makes it worth while what kinda love you have in side..
Especially the kinda heart as empty as mine
All the soft tenderness is the one thing i dont wanna miss..
I pray its time for me to say goodbye
Ill never forget looking in your eyes
I pray that i feel your touch and if god doesnt forget our love
I pray when i close my eyes i can still see visions of you in my mind
I pray that i can see you in another life i pray that your still by myside
Oh i pray
Everything that youve given me only comes in a fantasy
It seems like life go so fast and this time i wanna make it last
I hate that you live to die.. but only god knows why
We all have a purpose and to see you again will all be worth it
I pray its time for me to say goodbye
Ill never forget looking in your eyes
I pray that i feel your touch and if god doesnt forget our love
I pray when i close my eyes i can still see visions of you in my mind
I pray that i can see you in another life i pray that your still by myside
Oh i pray

I could rewind the very beginging the very second
Of my life and ask god on my hands and knees
To never let me forget all my special
Memories see im only promised today and if its my time to go
I dont want the love of my life to ever fade away so one
Last time let me open my eyes to see what my life use to be like oh god
I pray its time for me to say goodbye
Ill never forget looking in your eyes
I pray that i feel your touch and if god doesnt forget our love
I pray when i close my eyes i can still see visions of you in my mind
I pray that i can see you in another life i pray that your by myside
