(I got them candy kisses on my mind)

I never met nobody like you (Like you)
That'll do all the things that you do (That you do)
Every night when I go to sleep
Make my heart skip a beat
By the way that you kiss me

And ooh, now I see
This is the way that love's suppose to be
Me with you
You with me
I don't ever want you to leave
'Cause you give me

Candy kisses all over me
(I got them candy kisses on my mind)
Like a kid in the candy store
Always want to come back for more
'Cause he's my, now and later on a rainy day
Always seem to take my stress away
He's my sugar daddy, I'm his candy girl
We got the sweetest love in the whole
Wide world
You might also like
Oh, take me away
To another day where I can hear him say
Girl, I can't be without you
No, I can't be without you
Don't ever want to think about you loving
No one else, but me

And ooh, now I see
This is the way that love's suppose to be
Me with you
You with me
I don't ever want you to leave
'Cause you give me

Candy kisses all over me
(I got them candy kisses on my mind)
Like a kid in the candy store
Always want to come back for more
'Cause he's my, now and later on a rainy day
Always seem to take my stress away
He's my sugar daddy, I'm his candy girl
We got the sweetest love in the whole wide
World
Day dreaming all the time
Candy kisses on my mind
(Candy kisses, candy kisses, on my mind, on my mind)
Day dreaming all the time
Candy kisses on my mind

And ooh, now I see
This is the way that love's suppose to be
Me with you
You with me
I don't ever want you to leave
'Cause you give me

Candy kisses all over me
(I've got them candy kisses on my mind)
Like a kid in the candy store
Always want to come back for more
'Cause he's my, now and later on a rainy day
Always seem to take my stress away
He's my sugar daddy, I'm his candy girl
