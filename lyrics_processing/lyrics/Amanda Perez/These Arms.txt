Listen
Real talk
It all started March 2002
About to take it wit some people imagine you
Tell me what I'm gonna say huh
Tell me what I'm gonna do
I seen you once or twice
I seen her in your eyes
But i really did care cuz i knew i had to make you mine
I see it on her face she think she got you now
But I'm here to take her place
And man I'm tellin' ya life's real strange how we coincide
Cuz I'm tellin' you somehow you found me in the nick of time
Cuz i like da dip in da hood
Wood grip in da hood
You ain't messing with a rookie AP in da hood
Ain't by no games
I do my thang
But there's one thing i need to say
These arms of mine they are yearning from wanting you
These arms of mine they are lonely from missing you
Ok

Best kept secret on the low
Didn't really see didn't really know
Ya diggin' what i found my soul
Boy its so dramatic
How much i wanna have it
It was just like a quarter of happy
You might think that you do but u don't know what the half is
Man i think I'mma gonna lose my mind
Don't know if I'm wasting time
Can't tell if your running game
Can't tell if your throwing a line
So i got an issue
Every time that u leave ill miss u
When will i c u again?
Wen the next time ill kiss u
Nobody would have ever thought that i would leave my guy to be wit u
But i know this time in tell u its true
Its time for me to pursue all my thoughts and dreams
Cause i know nobody in this world are gonna do the things u do for me
You might also likeThese arms of mine they are yearning from wanting you
These arms of mine they are lonely from missing you
I wanna slow it down
I wanna speed it up
If u wanna come and get it boy, thats wuts up
I give u everything to the last drop
Don't hesitate
You don't need to stop
You ain't messing wit no immature
But I already know u can handle her
I would have never thought twice in the back of my mind
That through all these year u would finally be mine
These arms of mine they are yearning from wanting you
