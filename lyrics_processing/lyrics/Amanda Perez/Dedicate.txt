Look baby I'm down like fo' flats
I think you should know that
It get a little crazy when it comes to you baby
But the world is so shady
It got me feelin' like maybe I ain't the one for you girl
And I don't wanna hold back
I'm tryna capture the moment like I was Kodak
A thug to the heart but you already chose that
Really tryna see if you down for me
If you is baby girl, well you need to expose that
 (Layzie Bone)
Lately I been thinkin' 'bout (Wha 'chu thinkin' 'bout?)
All the things we been goin' through (Me too)
And how you break my heart (It ain't like that baby)
You think that I don't love you (it ain't even the case)
If you look deep inside your heart, you know that I really do care
So when you need me, I'll promise I'll be right there
That's why (That's real)
 Amanda Perez (Layzie Bone)
I dedicate, this song to the love of my life
(I wanna be wit 'chu for the rest of my life)
Lately I know things haven't seem to be, goin' right
(When it all go wrong we can make this right)
You know I'm the one for you
(You the one for me)
And you're the one for me
(I'm the one for you)
That's why I sing this song (Sing this song)
And tell you that I love you (I love you too)
Cause you're my one and only
You might also like (Layzie Bone)
Lyin' in my bed (Mm)
Tears fallin' down my face (Baby don't cry)
Prayin' to God
That our love don't fade away (It ain't goin' nowhere baby)
Cause it's ok, cause we can work it out (I know)
Cause with you I can't live without (I Can't live without 'chu)
And these words I need to say (Talk to 'em)
"It's to you I dedicate" (C'mon, holla at 'em)


What 'chu talkin' 'bout girl, this is little Layzie
Ain't another in the game or the streets can fade me
Better known as a renegade, never could change me
But the way you show me love, girl you could prolly save me
It's movin' kinda fast and it's really gettin' deep quick
It must be real, cause we tellin' our secrets
Back in the days I woulda said this was weak shit
But you got me open, I wanna creep with you, yes you
I only wanna be with you and roll with you, yes it's true
No matter what the homeboys say, it's all about 'chu
Yeah, I might just make you my fiance
Number one thug, when "Crazy in Love"
