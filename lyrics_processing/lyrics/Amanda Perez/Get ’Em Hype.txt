I'm wit it
If you down we can split
I guarantee that you can feel it
Giving you all my warm embraces
And if i give them to you
I guarantee they won't be wasted
Touch on your face wit my fingertips
Kiss you all over your body
With my soft lips
I whisper little things in your ear
Tell you all the little things
That you love and deserve to hear
I must admit
I'm always looking in your pretty eyes
Telling you i love you
When i tell the other fellows lies
And that's the way it's always gonna be
Cause i gotta give my baby boy
Everything he needs, see
And you don't even have to be asking
Cause i know you want some action
From this lady thug
Who'd be giving thug passion
Chorus
