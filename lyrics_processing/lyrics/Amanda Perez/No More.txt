Oh

I got some questions that I wanna ask you
And boy, don't even try lie
'Cause already found out the truth
Seen you at the hotel
Walkin' in room three
Told me you was workin'
But you were with her, cheatin' on me
No no no

No no no
I ain't takin this no more
It's time for me to say bye bye
Wipe away my tears 'cause there ain't no need to cry
Oh, no no no
I ain't takin' this no more
It's time for me to say bye bye
Wipe away my tears 'cause there ain't no need to cry

See, all you wanna do
Is play games with my mind
But boy, I don't play games
For the simple fact that I don't have the time
I kept it real with you
But you didn't keep it real with me
So here's the keys to your car
I think it's time for you to leave
Yeah
You might also like
No no no
I ain't takin this no more
It's time for me to say bye bye
Wipe away my tears 'cause there ain't no need to cry
Oh, no no no
I ain't takin' this no more
It's time for me to say bye bye
Wipe away my tears 'cause there ain't no need to cry

You tell me to call you
But you ain't ever home
Tell me hit you on your cellular
But your cellular ain't ever on
See, I was that girl
Who would be by your side
But I got sick and tired
Of all your lies

No no no
I ain't takin this no more
It's time for me to say bye bye
Wipe away my tears 'cause there ain't no need to cry
Oh, no no no
I ain't takin' this no more
It's time for me to say bye bye
Wipe away my tears 'cause there ain't no need to cry
So you want me to be your second Ms
But in it's place, find the one to be dissed
Don't play with me 'cause I ain't wit it
Wanna turn around and hate a fool
Well while you slay me, I'll slay you so
What what what you gon' do?
Now you think you the man with the master plan
But obviously you don't know who I am
Turn around and tell me, what's the deal?
When I will show you exactly how I feel
Here's the keys get in your ride take
Your clothes or they gon' be outside
Huh, what what what?
Take your key get in your ride
Take your clothes are they gon' be outside
Huh, what?
Oh, you think that I'm playin?
Ya better open up your ears and listen to what I'm sayin
'Cause what I'm sayin', I'm only sayin' today
Ha ha ha boy, I ain't playin
Oh, you think this is a joke>
Uh-uh, no no no
Your stuff is packed it out the door
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now I ain't

Wipe away my tears 'cause there ain't no need to cry
