Talk to me, that's the only way
I can find out what's going on
Finally, we can be ourselves
We don't have to be alone
I've given you the liberty
To make me feel good
I can make you feel good too
I've got a hold on you
You've got me torn in two
Why don't you take my love and run with it, run with it
All the way around the world and then back again, back again
Why would you walk when you could run with it
Baby, take all of my love, take all my love
When you smile at me the whole world stops
And I forget to breathe
Suddenly, we can be ourselves
You don't ever have to leave
Ain't no mistake, you can't go wrong
A love like this don't come along
I've got a hold on you, you got me torn in two
Oh, why don't you take my love and run with it, run with it
All the way around the world and then back again, back again
Why would you walk when you could run with it
Baby, take all of my love, take all my love
Baby, close the door and grab a hold of me
So tight, so right, so good all night
I can feel you so deep inside of me
So please tell me why don't you
Why don't you take my love
Oh, why don't you take my love and run with it, run with it
All the way around the world and then back again, back again
Why would you walk when you could run with it
Baby, take all of my love, take all my love
Oh, why don't you take my love and run with it, run with it
All the way around the world and then back again, back again
Why would you walk when you could run with it
Baby, take all of my love, take all my love
