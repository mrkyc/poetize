You make me feel good inside
You look into my eyes
I always try to hide my tears
But you always see my cries
Always see my cries
Just one kiss on my lips
And this love I know this is definitely it
This is definitely it

You make me feel like I need
To be lovin' you holdin' you feelin' you next to me
You make me feel so secure
Your love is so pure
It makes me feel like I need more
You make me feel so safe
I couldn't ever let no one come and take your place
You make me feel, you make feel
Sunshine, you're finally shining over me
Unconditional love I finally see
See a world with a whole new place
I see his love and it's written all over his face
This has got to be real, 'cause you make me feel
You might also like
You make me feel like I need
To be lovin' you holdin' you feelin' you next to me
You make me feel so secure
Your love is so pure
It makes me feel like I need more
You make me feel so safe
I couldn't ever let no one come and take your place
You make me feel, you make feel
Sometimes I sit and I think about
What my life would be with you without
Without love and affection
Without you my life has no direction
Direction to stay on my feet
Without your love my life has no meaning
If you were gone, I'd be so alone

You make me feel like I need
To be lovin' you holdin' you feelin' you next to me
You make me feel so secure
Your love is so pure
It makes me feel like I need more
You make me feel so safe
I couldn't ever let no one come and take your place
