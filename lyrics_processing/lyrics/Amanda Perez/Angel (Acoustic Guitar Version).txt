Left without a word, nothing to say
(Nothing to say)
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you, no ohh, so I asked God
God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry
(Cry)
God send me an angel to wipe these tears from my eyes
And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still loved you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something that I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
'Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries, so God
God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry
(All I do is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe these tears from my eyes
(Send me an angel)
Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep
And you made me feel like I could not breathe
(Breathe)
When I, all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And to give you all of my love
(To give you all of my love)
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now but you can't have it, oh God
God send me an angel from the heavens above
( Send me an angel)
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
(Oh God)
'Cause all I do is cry
(Is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe these tears from my eyes
(Send me an angel)
Ohh ohh, God send me an angel
(God send me an angel)
Wipe the tears from my eyes
()
Send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
(God send me an angel)
(Send me an angel oh God)
Wipe the tears from my eyes
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
(Send me an angel)
