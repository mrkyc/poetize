I've been only single four months
I'm just tryna get my swag back
Probably try to catch a few kids
It's like I never let 'em ride back
Torn apart, catch me, I'm on the run
Told my BM she can have that
Put that on my daughter and my son
Every night I'm having flashbacks

You don't cross the line
Fuck your glass of wine
It's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever, it's whatever
It's whatever, it's whatever-whatever, it's whatever

You like to talk 'bout forever
Talk 'bout what's right for once, yeah
So far, can't turn back now
I guess we found out no basic
