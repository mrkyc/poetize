Sophisticated in a black dress
Sipping red wine and looking her best
Meet the folks, she'll pass that test
Any apprehension
Yeah, she'll put it to rest

She's a pageant queen
Been that way since she was seventeen
Better looking than the girls on the silver screen
Everyday is like a movie scene
She gives her free time to charity
All my friends think she's too good for me

But when we're home
And we're alone
Oh, you'd never know

It's a freak show
She's a wild one
A whole lot of crazy when the sun goes down
A whole different woman comes out
It's a freak show
Like you wouldn't believe
Even when she hasn't had a thing to drink
It's her style, hide something beneath that smile
Our own little secret, nobody knows
You should see her when the doors close
It's a freak show

She talks politics, art history
How she does it, it's a mystery
Cause when the girl starts talking to me
It's enough to drive a man crazy

She's Jekyll, she's Hyde
She's day, she's night
There's no blurring the lines
She's one or the other
But whenever we're together

It's a freak show
She's a wild one
A whole lot of crazy when the sun goes down
A whole different woman comes out
It's a freak show
Like you wouldn't believe
Even when she hasn't had a thing to drink
It's her style, hide something beneath that smile
Our own little secret, nobody knows
You should see her when the doors close
It's a freak show
But when we're home
And we're alone
Oh, you'd never know

It's a freak show
She's a wild one
A whole lot of crazy when the sun goes down
A whole different woman comes out
It's a freak show
Like you wouldn't believe
Even when she hasn't had a thing to drink
It's her style, hide something beneath that smile
Our own little secret, nobody knows
You should see her when the doors close
