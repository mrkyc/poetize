Football lights, Friday nights
Don't play no more
But that's still my team
And back behind those bleachers
There's a spot where I kissed
The homecoming queen

Spent most of my years in these ten square miles
It's seen all of my tears
It's seen all of my smiles
I always said I wanted to leave
Now it's the only place I want to be

This is my town, this is my town
There ain't an inch of road I ain't been down
This is my town, this is my town
Long as I'm living I'll be hanging 'round
It's the middle of nowhere
But I call it home there
I ain't afraid to say it loud and proud
This is my town, this is my town

Everybody knows everybody
And everybody knows me by my first name
As the world gets complicated
We just try to keep it simple
And stay the same

There's dirt on them roads
I don't want them to pave it
Every memory I got
Yeah, them dirt roads they made it
If you're anything like me
Take your drink and raise it
Yeah, go on and say it

This is my town, this is my town
There ain't an inch of road I ain't been down
This is my town, this is my town
Long as I'm living I'll be hanging 'round
It's the middle of nowhere
But I call it home there
I ain't afraid to say it loud and proud
This is my town, this is my town, yeah

It's the middle of nowhere
But I call it home there
That's what I'm all about
It's where I was raised
At the end of my days
It's where they'll lay me down
This is my town, this is my town
There ain't an inch of road I ain't been down
This is my town, this is my town
Long as I'm living I'll be hanging 'round
It's the middle of nowhere
But I call it home there
I ain't afraid to say it loud and proud
This is my town, this is my town
