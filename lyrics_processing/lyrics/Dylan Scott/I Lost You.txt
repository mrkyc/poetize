There's a line drawn across this bar
Here I am and there you are
Like two strangers in the dark
With all the same frames
I'm gonna act like I don't care
Like you don't catch my stare
'Cause what's the point of going back to where
We've already been

Baby, I put all I had in it
I held a good hand
But I just couldn't win it
You wanted my love
Up until you didn't
And that's just the truth
It was good
So good 'til it wasn't
And it's gonna hurt like hell 'til it doesn't
So I'm gonna drink like I've got nothing
Nothing to lose
'Cause I lost you

I'm gonna order up another round
'Cause I've got your memory to drown
Funny how the hard stuff goes down
So easy, too easy
And I know just what you're thinking
'Cause I know you when you've been drinking
And girl, that's the only reason
You're saying you need me
