I know you're gettin' ready, I know we're in a hurry
Got a dinner reservation around 8:30
So whatcha say we go ahead and cancel it (Cancel it)
I can barely handle you in that dress

With skin that smooth, it's hard to keep my hands off you
Got a few things in mind I wanna do
Baby, why save it?
When I can lay you down now and later
Put some rose petals out on the sheets (On the sheets)
Make this bedroom feel like a suite (Like a suite)
Girl, you know we ain't even gotta leave (Gotta leave)
Tonight I'll love you like, love you like it's our anniversary (It's our anniversary)

I can see it in your eyes, girl, you think I'm playin'
But we ain't goin' nowhere, this room is where we're stayin'
We can make it like a second honeymoon (Honeymoon)
Gonna love you like the night I said "I do"

With skin that smooth, it's hard to keep my hands off you
Got a few things in mind I wanna do
Baby, why save it?
When I can lay you down now and later
Put some rose petals out on the sheets (On the sheets)
Make this bedroom feel like a suite (Like a suite)
Girl, you know we ain't even gotta leave (Gotta leave)
Tonight I'll love you like, love you like it's our anniversary
With skin that smooth, it's hard to keep my hands off you
Got a few things in mind I wanna do
Baby, why save it?
When I can lay you down now and later
Put some rose petals out on the sheets (On the sheets)
Make this bedroom feel like a suite (Like a suite)
Girl, you know we ain't even gotta leave (Gotta leave)
Tonight I'll love you like, love you like it's our anniversary
Gonna love you like it's our anniversary, yeah (It's our anniversary)
