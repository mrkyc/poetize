Yeah, hopefully my time ain't right around that bend
And I still got some good years down here left to live
I was thinking 'bout that stone they're gonna put up on my grave
Yeah, here's what I'd want mine to say

Yeah, "here lies a proud of where he's from
Son of a hardworking, god-fearing, straight-shooting gun
That shirt on his back was always something you could take"
Yeah, right there, right under my name
I hope it says
"Damn good buddy
That sure loved his wife
And his truck stayed muddy
'Til the day that he died"
And I hope that that rock's got a whole lot of space
'Cause here's what I'd want mine to say

Well, he sure raised some hell
But that ain't where he's going
His heart was on his sleeve
And his screen door was always open
And that preacher that'll be standing there
When they sing "Amazing Grace"
Yeah, here's what I'd want mine to say
