One for the treble! Two for the bass! Come Busy Bee im about to rock the place!

Don't worry if I'm really busting nines, I'll touch the lives, if your listening for all the signs x4

I spit a one line and fuse magic
Puff cabbage and on the deadly, man we live lavish
Lushlife, so put your L's up and live like its
'99, I got some problems with the way I live
Plus the love balloon float away
Black smoke, in the four door I pull away
Tennis shoes, Stan Smith just to throw away
I gotta wait for your heels before I blow away, I gotta say
My, your looking for the lime light, silly asking me
I spit a line and rhyme right until I pass the piece
Spit it past the sunshine, spit it past the trees
Swaying in the wind when I spin a masterpiece
The words falling into my arms, confetti
Rocking one of my charms, bomb heavy like we up in the Bronx
A don dada, the beautiful thang
Play it up with me mic, cuz you ain't seeing the rain

You might also like
This be that whip-riding, ghost-writing night time jam
City streets buzzing on something on how nice I am
Something you can feel, steady from the ice I spend
From my right hand, I write it in a verse my fam
And tell the story that I turn into gold dust
Lust and ice grill from the way that I flow up
To everybody thinking that I ain't gonna show up
I disappear, reappear, ready to blow up
These cats wanna get their smile off for once
Plus the blunts is a far cry from having lunch
I'm having too many hunger pains to give it up
I split it up into parts and then I live it up
I live a charmed life running up in summer nights
Balmy weather, then bomb tracks and warm mics, word is bond
I'm an all night veteran and doing the thing black
I sing rap and breathe truth and say what I think black


Cut to amber rock frozen night
Still life of the night, I want my five mics
Drinking amber vodka floating dice
Floating nice up on the champagne, on the campaign to live my life
I gotta spell it out in black ink, black I'm starting to think
I gotta rap rings around the planets
Yea, I never even saw it coming
Shoe gazing when the stars was humming, Fantasy Island fronting
And you never gotta think when I construct the lines
That I sit around and write the rhymes
Don't worry if I'm really busting nines, I'll touch the lives
If your listening for all the signs, and yo
I flashback to '86, six deep, spitting the wiz
Fresh biz in '97 so we did it for kicks
So when I spit heaven future fantastic, tell you what girl
Double L, spitting the habit
I wonder how many people in the city live in furnished rooms. Late at night, when I look out at the buildings I swear I see a face in every window looking back at me, and when I turn away, I wonder how many go back to their desks and write this down
