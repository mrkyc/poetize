Things id like to do
Oh oh the things id love to say
I cherish every moment that you're around
I might not show it cuz i can't find the words to say
I try to say i love u, but i get tongue tied
I start to lose the words and fail in every way
I wish you would stay longer
Bright up my life like Disney world
I wish u wud stay longer
But just like magic you were gone
Woman just a likkle more time wudda stay inna mi world
I wan ya brighten up mi life, mek it glisten like pearl
Just a likkle more time wudda stay inna mi world
I wan ya brighten up mi life, mek it glisten like...
Your a nice and descent well brought up girl
Your the pillar to my castle, the mistress to my world
Lighten up my life, cuh yuh the shine shine girl
I wan ya open up ya life and give me full control
I wish you would stay longer
Bright up my life like Disney world
I wish u wud stay longer
But just like magic you were gone
Well the (?) nah stop an disappearing act
Gone outta mi life n nah oh she come back
So much tings ta say, so much tings ta chat
Hand pon ya leg n me mind pon ya clat
Just a likkle more time, yuh wudda stay inna mi world
I wan yuh lighten up mi life mek it glisten like pearl
Likkle more time, woman dun inna mi world
I wan yuh lighten up mi life mek it glisten like pearl
I could not ask for more, wen eva we go in town
Situation gets serious i feel my knees begin to shake
(?) get out of room, cause this no doctors case
I must get my act together
To lose you would be such a waste
I wish you would stay longer
Bright up my life like Disney world
I wish u wud stay longer
But just like magic you were gone
It bring sorrow to mi heart and sadness to mi face
Trembling from mi hip go do straight to mi waist
The way u mash up mi heart n mash up mi face
And a step in a hurry n move inna haste
So much tings to say i wanna tell it to ya face
But mi can't find di words to fit di perfect space
Just a likkle more time wudda stay inna mi world
I wan yuh lighten up mi life mek it glisten like pearl
Likkle more time wudda stay inna mi world
I wan yuh lighten up mi life mek it glisten like pearl
Your a nice and descent well brought up girl
Your the pillar to my castle, the mistress to my world
Lighten up my life, cuh yuh the shine shine girl
Just a likkle more time wudda stay inna mi world
I wan yuh lighten up mi life mek it glisten like pearl
Likkle more time wudda stay inna mi world
I wan yuh lighten up mi life mek it glisten like pearl
It bring sorrow to mi heart and sadness to mi face
