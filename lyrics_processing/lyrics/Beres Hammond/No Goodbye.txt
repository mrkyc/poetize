I can't, no
I can't...

Every time I think of saying goodbye
Everything inside me says it's a lie

So I can't
No I can't
No I can't
Yes

Yes, you've been with me right through the rough
And you've never said, "I've had enough"

So I can't
No, I can't
No, I can't
Yeah honey...

I'd like to repay you for damages done
I know I won't be able to repair it all 'cause I lost count
And with all the time you've been hurting
You're still so fine and it's blowing my mind
I know I should pack and walk away and leave you nothing to remind

But I can't
