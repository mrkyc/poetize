Everything about today is magic, yeah
Like a breath of fresh air, I watch you standing there
Thanks for the time, picture frozen in my mind
Life's been a thorn in my side, forces me to incline
All to myself mission assigned
I'll have to see you again somewhere down the road
Oh, let me see you again before I explode
I'll spend all of my time, I'll search until I find
If I have to hunt you down, hunt you in the ground, yeah
Now as a broken man who never really had a plan
Don't have to prove to no one, hey
And there as it goes my purple rose
For my faults expose, case closed, yeah
I'll have to see you again somewhere down the road
Oh, let me see you again before I explode
I'll spend all of my time, I'll search until I find
If I have to hunt you down, hunt you in the ground, yeah
Whoa, yes, everything is magic, yeah, magic, yeah
Now come out of my dreams and into my world
Hey, honey, come inside this soul
Wherever you are, reveal yourself and understand
If I don't have you, there's nothing left
I'll have to see you again somewhere down the road
I'll have to see you again before I explode
I'll spend all of my time and I'll search until I find
If I have to hunt you down, hunt you, hunt you, hunt you down
Like a breath of fresh air, I watch you standing there
Thanks for the time, picture frozen in my mind
Life's been a thorn in my side, forces me to incline
All to myself mission assigned
I'll have to see you again somewhere down the road
Let me see you again before I explode
I spend all of my time, search until I find
If I have to hunt you down, hunt you in the ground
