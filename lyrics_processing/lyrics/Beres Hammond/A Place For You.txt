Always hold you in my arms
When it's rough out there, if there's a storm
I'll be by your place, I'll keep you warm
So don't nobody say 'cause I don't care
Wishes well and leave it there
They chew you up and spit you out
And tell me how can I live without?
All of the pain that you will bring
They don't know where you have been
That you're a child, oh God
You've got my word
There's a place for you in my heart
Always hold you in my arms
When it's rough out there, if there's a storm
I'll be by your place, I'll keep you warm
I got you back, got you back
Got you back, baby
People will play little games they play
Whether you do or don't obey
Everybody needs someone
And you've been searching all along
