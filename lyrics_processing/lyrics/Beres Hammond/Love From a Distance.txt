I hope it's not gonna be long, no
Please, don't make it long, now

I see love from a distance
Coming, but slowly
I know it's gonna last forever
I feel us coming closer, closer and closer
It's the time we get it together

Wow
I know you've done a lot of wrongs, but I'm willing to forgive
No one has the right to decide how the other man should live
Sometimes we should stop and count to ten before we make each other hurt
'Cause later on you realize it really had no worth

I see love from a distance
Coming, but slowly
I know it's gonna last forever
I feel us coming closer, closer and closer
It's the time we get it together

Woah woah
Mama, she's taught us for so long with her heart all full of tears
And the wisdom in her eyes kept me safe through all the years
Make me grow to understand that there's still good folks around
And to keep her in your hearts is to be on solid ground
