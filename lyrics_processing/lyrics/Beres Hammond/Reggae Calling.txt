It needs a love injection
I'm a calling out America
Calling out to Africa
I'm a calling out to Russia
And darling sweet Jamaica
War has no winner
I'm a calling on the presidents
Calling all prime ministers
I'm a calling out to Russia
And darling sweet Jamaica
War has no winner
And when you love
What joy you feel within
And when you hurt someone
What do you gain
Our children die for what
They don't even know
Your kids hate mine
'Cause we made it so
Tell me what in the world
Are we waiting for
To stop love from walking
Out of that door

Calling out to Africa
I'm a calling out to Russia
And darling sweet Jamaica
War has no winner
Fighting for power
You're fighting for land
I'm so confused
I just can't understand
You lose your family
And I lose my best friend
Hurt will be heard
Cause they all start pain
Tell me what in the world
Are we waiting for
To stop love from walking
Out of that door

Calling all prime ministers
I'm a calling out to Russia
And darling sweet Jamaica
War has no winner
I long to live long
To breathe some fresh air
I long to walk the streets
Without any fear
Our children die for what
They don't even know
Your kids hate mine
'Cause we made it so
Tell me what in the world
Are we waiting for
To stop love from walking
Out of that door
