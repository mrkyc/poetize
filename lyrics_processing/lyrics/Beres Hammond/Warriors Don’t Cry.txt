It's either you're in or out
Gotta know what you're all about
Be bold and strong
Tell yourself you're not doing wrong
Once you're in you've got to take it
Make your mind up son and face it
Because Warriors don't cry
I know lots of folks will hate you
And not because they want to
But sometimes they don't even know why

So don't watch the crowd
Their duty is to be loud
Believe in what you're doing
And feel proud
Cause when you fall along the way
People will have lots to say
They don't even care if you make it through the day

Either you're in or out
Gotta know what you're all about
Be bold and strong
Tell yourself you're not doing wrong
