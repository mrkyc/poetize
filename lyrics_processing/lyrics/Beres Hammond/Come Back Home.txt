Oooh
Oh my!
Oh yeah

Baby, I gotta call you up
I feel the need for you tonight
Oh, my little apple
I'd certainly take a bite
My poor body is calling
And needs attention fast
'Til you're hear beside me, baby
That's how long this pain is gonna last

You'd better come back home
Come back home
You've better come back home
You'd better come back home

Oh yeah!
Can't remember how long it's been...
I've sure lost track of time
Don't ask me, how am I doing?
I can't say I'm doing fine
My world is topsy-turvy
Everything is upside down
It's no use explaining
Got to come see what's going

Hey!
You give to me, and I'll give to you
You do it to me, and I'll do it to you
Baby, give to me, and I'll give to you
You do it me, baby

Baby, I gotta call you up
I feel the need for you tonight
Oh, my little apple
I'd certainly take a bite
My little body is calling
And needs attention fast
Until you're hear beside me, baby
That's how long it's gonna last
Oh!
Listen to me, baby
Listen to me, my sweet
These things have no say
Honestly, I'm coming straight
There is this little tingling that constantly comes on
I don't feel it for nobody else, only you alone

You'd better come back home
Come back home
You'd better come back home
You'd better come back home

You do it to me, and I'll do it to you
You give to me, and I'll give to you
You do it to me, and I'll do it to you
You give to me, baby

You've gotta come back home
Lonely, I'm lone-....
I needed your tender touch, baby
You do it to me one more time
I need this old time feeling
