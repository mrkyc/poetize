So why not let it be?
And stop worryin' about it?
As long as we know what's in our hearts
We know our inner thoughs
Hey, no reason for concern, no
They gonna talk, they gonna talk, they gonna talk
They gonna say a lot of things about us
You said you know that our love is not a sin
But you worry what the people say
And they see me with you
And, wonder what the crowd will say
And they find us together
Wonder what the people say
And they know we're in love
Worry what the crowd will say....
You pass them on the street, yes...
Greet them with a smile hey
As broad as the Nile
They'll say all kinds of things to you yes
That lingers for awhile
Over in your mind
You wanna go, you wanna stay
It seems that you can never ever make your mind about it
Well, but if you know that love is deep within
Why should you worry what the folks will say?
