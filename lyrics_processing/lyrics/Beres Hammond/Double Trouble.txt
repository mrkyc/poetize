I am so Tired
What a Confrontation, this will be
Now look at me
At a quarter to three
I wanna go home
That's where I should be
Don't know what to do
Or what I should say
Gotta make up my mind
Before night turns to day
Be early
She told me
I'll be waiting for you honey
I'll make something special for you
Now how am I going to enter?
I can't afford to wake her
With lipstick stains
I've got to tip toe
Now double trouble
Is waiting
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm tired
I'm sleepy
Can't take the nagging in my head
Double trouble
Is waiting
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm so tired
I wanna go home

Wonder if she's awake or asleep
If I know her well
She's somewhere taking a peek
What will my story be?
This one better good
Should I tell her I had a confrontation, with Robin Hood?
Be early
She told me
I'll be waiting for you honey
I'll make something special for you
Now how am I going to enter?
I can't afford to wake her
With lipstick stains
I've got to tip toe
Now double trouble
Is waiting
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm tired
I'm sleepy
Can't take the nagging in my head
Double trouble
Is waiting
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm so tired
I wanna go home
Now I am worried for my life
Its going to fight
When I am finally inside
Will I still be alive?
Now fate is behind the door
Got to come sell the tour
The night is so cold
I can't take it no more, no
She told me
Be early
I'll be waiting for you honey
I'll make something special for you
Now how am I going to enter?
I can't afford to wake her
With lipstick stains
I've got to tip toe
For double trouble
Is waiting
It's wrapped up in my bed
I'm tired
I'm sleepy
Can't take the nagging in my head
Double trouble
