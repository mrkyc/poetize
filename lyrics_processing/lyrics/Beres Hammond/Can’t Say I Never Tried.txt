'Cause that is all I have
I could have promised you the world and its riches
And anything that pleases
Reality is no, 'cause that's not how it goes
You gotta love me for who I am
And show the world you don't give a damn
I spend precious moments of the day
Worrying about you
I pray and I pray and I ask the Father
To pull you through
Watch your step and guide your head
And make sure you're not misled
'Cause if someone should offend you
It would hurt me so bad, yes
I am so vulnerable at this time
And I don't know what I'll do, no, no
Don't wanna get too uncomfortable
So I'm counting on you, yeah
Stick to the ones who love you most
Yeah, more than anybody in the world
Stick to the ones you know you can trust
Yeah, yeah
Can't say I never tried, you can say it's because of I
'Cause you don't have to fail
And if you do, I'll share the blame
But don't feel ashamed
'Cause I will be there for you with open arms
At the 23rd 
To comfort you and care for you
And love you like no one can do
I can't wait for the moment when
We can get back together again
And then there's no secret, no reason to fake it
Yeah
I'm trying my best to keep it cool, make it look good
But I'm burning up from the inside, yeah
And in spite of everything, I tried to keep it in strive
And I hope you'll abide, yes
And stick to the ones who love you most
More than anything in this whole wide world
Stick to the ones you know you can trust, yes
Can't say I never tried, you can say it's because of I
No, you don't have to fail
And if you do I'll share the blame
So don't feel ashamed
