Oh I pay you some mind
Glad, I didn't turn you down
I watched you all these years
Holding your head up high
Just wanting to be someone
And all the fellows around
They didn't pay you no mind
Why did they not look twice
They must have been blind
But I could tell from the start
You had love in your heart
And you want it so much
To let it go
You needed the chance
To show a little romance
Now the table has turned
They're running you down, baby
Show it off
Show them what you've got now honey
Throw it off
Burn them cause your hot no baby
Let it off
Let them feel the heat now honey
Show it off
You got them at your feet now baby

I remember standing on the corner
With the brothers hanging out
And they'd stare at every woman
But never at you
But I've always admired
And had a silent crush on you
But how could I tell the brothers
They'd laugh and say it's not true
And they called you names
I'm ashamed to repeat
And even say you're walking in your sleep, nahnah
Then you disappeared
And came back last year
Now the same guys are saying
Ooh, what a heat, baby
Show it off
Show them what you've got now honey
Throw it off
Burn them cause your hot no baby
Let it off
Let them feel the heat now honey
Show it off
You've got them at your feet now baby
Show it off
And make me feel so good
Whoo now now now
Didn't think you could do it
How could you look so well
The expressions on their faces
Are here too, you can tell
Now they're acting so friendly
Everyone wants to be near
It's either they don't remember
Or they just don't care
They used to call you names
I'm ashamed to repeat
And even say you're walking in your sleep
Then you disappeared
And came back last year
Now the same guys are saying
Ooh, what a heat, baby
Show it off
Show them what you've got now honey
Throw it off
Burn them cause your hot no baby
Let it off
Let them feel the heat now honey
