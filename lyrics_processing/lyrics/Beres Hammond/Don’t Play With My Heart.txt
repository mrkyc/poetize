My dear Renee, I might have to say
So long, so long, so long
Sorry, it didn't work out

But I won't waste no more time over you, oh no
When with this life I got better things to do, oh
Why should I waste precious time over you? Oh yeah
You mussi check say no one needs me, so you play with my heart

Now why would I cry if you're leaving tomorrow?
Check and see who is surprised
Why should I die if you tell me it's over?
When will you realize?
Every man needs a woman for comfort
Nothing to mix up the brain
So if you ever, ever think for a moment
That you can run this man insane

No way, ain't gonna waste no more time over you, oh no
When with my life I've got better things to do, oh yeah
Why should I waste precious time over you? Oh yeah
Or when you check say no one needs me, so you play with my heart

Tick-a-tick-a-tock and the clock is a-running
Now I'm gonna make you a deal
If you're gonna stay or tell me if you're leaving
But make sure this time it's for real
'Cause I'm not the kind of a man to be pleading
'Cause that'd only mess with my pride
So though deep down inside I'll be bleeding
I'd still have to push you aside

'Cause I ain't gonna waste more time over you, no
Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

My dear Renee, it is not okay
For you to come and go and do whatever pleases

I ain't gonna waste no more time over you, oh no
When with my life I got better things to do, wow
Ain't gonna waste no more time over you
You mussi check say no one needs me, so you play with my heart

Now why should I cry when you're leaving tomorrow?
Check and see who is surprised
Why would I die if you tell me it's over?
When will you realize?
Every man needs a woman for comfort
Nothing to mix up the brain
So if you ever, ever think for a moment
If you can run this man insane

No way, ain't gonna waste no more time over you, oh no
When with my life I got better things to do
Ain't gonna waste no more time over you
You mussi check say no one needs me, so you play with my heart

Ooh Renee, it's time to say
