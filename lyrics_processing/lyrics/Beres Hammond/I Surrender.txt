I'm never giving, no, no, I was wrong
Hey woman, you never know
How much I miss you
Wish that you could touch my hand
Just like you did before
I wish that you could call my name
And make me surrender
Wish that you could feel my needs
And know that I long for you
I miss every single thing we used to do
Baby, I surrender, I can't fight it anymore
This war has taken toll, I am out of ammunition
I surrender, now you can have it your way
See, love is everything and what I need to do
If I think I know you well, there is no new lucky man
I see that you're still hurting, it's gonna take time
And so I'm back again just like a brand new man
Tell me what to do? And tell me how to play?
I surrender, I can't fight it anymore
This war has taken toll, I am out of ammunition
I surrender, now you can have it your way
Just tell me what to do? Tell me how to play?

No more to explore, no, no
My life won't be the same if you say you won't remain
That person I still adore
So I surrender, I can't fight it anymore
This war has taken toll out of ammunition
I surrender, have it your way
See, your love is everything and what I need to do
Trust me I'm lonely
I long for you, say I long for you
Now all I wanna do is just live for you babe, yes
I surrender, I can't fight it anymore
This war has taken toll out of ammunition
I surrender, now you can have it your way
Love is everything and what I need to know
I surrender, if only I, if I know I would miss you so much
I, I, I, I, I, surrender
Don't know how much more I can beg to you but
Baby, baby, I, yes
I surrender, now you can have it your way
