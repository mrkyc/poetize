Queen And Lady
Buju: Lady Love! This woman she's like a blessing from above
Got to let dem know dat
Beres: Talking about you
Might as well I tell you about the thoughts that I've been hiding
A list so long I hardly know where to start (lady love)
Don't be offended if I tell you you're a helluva kind a woman
And you do something special to my heart
I see you as a queen and a lady, no ifs, no buts, no maybe
The only thing sweeter than my honeycomb
Keep up as the same queen and lady
Keep it standing steady, the only thing sweeter than my honeycomb
Buju: Watch yah
This man won't stand the every day dissing
Woman reminiscing whole month she been missing
Committing di ultimate sin
When a yu mi entrust with safe keeping every single thing
When mi think yu lef di boy gal yu still deh wid him
Sneaking around privately meeting
Must did tell yu seh di doop is sleeping
Thru mi love yu so much an mi nuh want do nothing
I going put yu under manners with sweet discpline

And now let me tell you what a joy it is to have you
And no two people in the world could be the same. (Lady love)
You provide me with inspiration
I know I'm in the right direction
You're always there come sun come ah rain
See you as a queen and a lady no ifs, no buts, no maybe
The only thing sweeter than my honeycomb
Keep up as the same queen and lady keep it standing steady
You're the only thing sweeter than my honeycomb
Buju:
Caan watch the finance things nuh all that balance
Through the grace of the lord we shall find our bread
Baby love nuh make the lack of funds get to yuh head
What provide is enough don't have no reason fi beg
Yu ah my girl now let's move on ahead
I've got plans for yu, so much we got to do
Nuh mek nuh man bust yu salad wid no idiot tackle
Beres: (repeat first verse)
Buju:
You may be someone else lady before
But yu ah my girl now, my woman now
Almshouse weh use to gwaan dat caan gwaan no more
Cause yu ah my girl now, my woman now. (Repeat)
