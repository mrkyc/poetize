Oh baby
I would walk a mile
I would walk a mile ore two
Just for you baby
I wanna explain to you, that you're the hit on every corner
Gotta confess to you girl, just what you're doing to this brother
You got my heart, my head and my mind, all burnin' with desire
And if ever I was given a chance, every bone in my body would give thanks
Now baby, what do you expect of me
Now should I stand in the middle of the road, let something run over me
So that I can get your full attention
Wanna explain to you, you're the hit on every corner
Gotta confess to you girl, just what you are doing to this brother
You got my heart, my mind and my soul, all burnin' with desire
And if ever I was given a chance, every bone in my body would give thanks
Don't let me cry to you, oh no, crying is a sign of weakness
But I wouldn't lie to you, no, that will be destroying for my fitness, girl
I would walk a mile, a mile ore maybe two
Just for you baby, just for you baby
Now baby, what do you expect of me
Now should I stand in the middle of the road, let something run over me
So that I can get your full attention
