Pressure..
No I never can understand it
The way the system plan, (pressure)
There's no hope, no chance, no loophole
No escape for a suffering man
'Cause every time I lift my head above water
And try to save myself from drown
There's an overnight scheme all worked out
Designed to keep ah me down
Still I'm
Putting up a resistance
I'm ah gonna work it out
You know I'm
Putting up a resistance
I've got to work it out
Blow wind blow, blow wind blow
I want to stay home tonight
I long to spend some time with the family
But staying home won't make it right
Sometimes the pressure make me feel like bawling
When every sign says no way out
Breaking my back to make an overtime dollar
That just goes from hand to mouth
