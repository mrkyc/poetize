You're out there makin' all that dough;
But they keep you late workin' that overtime
And I don't ever see you no more
I guess you're not checkin' your message machine;
Seems like you're never in
I got a hunch if we could just do lunch
I could get your attention again
I know you got your schedule and you're keeping it tight
You got something going morning noon and night;
I got something I know you're gonna like--
Honey can you squeeze me in?
I got it circled in red on my calendar baby:
You told me that tonight's the night
I got the champagne chilled, got the gourmet meal
Soft music and candle light
I try to get to you on the phone; I get stuck on hold
I guess you keep gettin' sidetracked
I keep faxing you love notes all day long
But you don't ever fax me back
I know you got your schedule and you're keeping it tight
You got something going morning noon and night;
I got something I know you're gonna like--
Honey can you squeeze me in?

You got me workin' around the clock honey tryin' to figure you out
I know time is money, but there's more to life honey
Than how much you can spend
You gotta make a little time for the good times--
Honey can you squeeze me in?
