Blood in all the streets, running like a flood
There's nowhere to hide, nowhere that I can go
I reach out my hand, touching death itself
Just a holy day in Sarajevo
I can hear my heart, pounding like a clock
Hiding from the planes and from the bombing
Fire from the sky, burning down my life
There is no more love and no more longing

But when I close my eyes, I dream of peace
I dream of flowers on the hill
I dream I see my mother smiling
When I close my eyes, I dream of peace

Once I had a home, once my life was good
Once my mother sang to me and held me
Then the fire came, falling from the sky
There is no one left who can protect me
War's a wicked bird that never comes to rest
Feeding on the dreams of all the children
War's an evil bird flying in the dark
Every holy promise has been broken

But when I close my eyes, I dream of peace
I dream of flowers on the hill
I dream I see my mother smiling
When I close my eyes, I dream of peace

Can't you stop the war, bring it to a close?
You are tall and strong and I am just a child
Can't we live in peace, stop the flowing blood?
Make a blessed world where I can be a child

When you close your eyes, do you dream of peace?
Do you dream of flowers on the hill?
Do you dream you see your mother smiling?
When you close your eyes, do you dream of peace?
When you close your eyes, do you dream of peace?
Do you dream of flowers on the hill?
Do you dream you see your mother smiling?
