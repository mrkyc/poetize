Time has come I will sing you
This sad goodbye song
When I was seventeen, I used to know you
Well, I haven't seen you, many is the short year
And the last time I seen you
You said you'd joined the Church of Jesus
Well me, I remember your long red hair falling in our faces
As you kissed me
And I want you to know, I just had to go
I want you to know, we just had to grow
And you're probably married now
House and car and all
And you turned into a grownup male stranger
And if I was lying with you now
I'd just have to fall
We parted so hard
Me, rushing round Britain with a guitar
Making love to people
That I didn't even like to see
Well, I would think of you
Yes, I mean in the six sad morning
And in the lonely midnight
Try to hold your face before me

And I want you to know, we just had to grow
And you're probably married now, kids and all
And you turned into a grownup male stranger
And if I was lying with you now
I wouldn't be here at all
I never slept with you
But we must have made love a thousand times
For we were just young, didn't have no place to go
Yet in the wide hills and by many a long water
You have gathered flowers, and did they not smell for me?
And I want you to know, we just had to grow
And I want you to know, I just had to go
So it's goodbye first love
And I hope you are fine
I am a sweet man's woman
Maybe some day to have babies by
