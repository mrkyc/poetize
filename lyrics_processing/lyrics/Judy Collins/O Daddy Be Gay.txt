O daddy be gay
There was an old man who lived under the hill
If he ain't goin' away he'd be livin' there still
Daddy be gay if you can be
One day the devil came down to his plow
O daddy be gay
One day the devil came down to his plow
Said one of your family I'll have to have now
Daddy be gay if you can be
O tis not just your son or daughter I crave
O daddy be gay
Tis not your son or your daughter I crave
But your old baggin' wife I'll carry away
Daddy be gay if you can be
Ah take her away with all of my heart
O daddy be gay
Take her away with all of my heart
And I'll bet the two of you never will part
Daddy be gay if you can be
The devil he hoisted her up on his back
O daddy be gay
The devil he hoisted her up on his back
And off to hell with her in a pack
Daddy be gay if you can be
