Colorado, Colorado
When the world leaves you shivering
And the blizzard blows
When the snow flies and the night falls
There's a light in the window
And a place called home
At the end of the storm

One night on the mountain I was headed for Estes
When the roads turned to ice and it started to snow
Put on the chains in a whirl of white powder
Halfway up to Berthoud near a diner I know
And the light burned inside, shinin' down through the snowfall
God, it was cold and the temperature droppin'
Went in for coffee and I shivered as I drank it
Warm in my hands in the steam as it rose

Sitting there at the counter was a dark-headed stranger
Me and the owner and him keepin' warm
Nodded hello and I said, "It's a cold one
Looks like there might be a blizzard tonight"
And "Yes," said the owner, "There's a big storm on the mountain
Good thing we're open, we could be here for hours
There's nothin' for miles and it's too late to get to Denver
Better not try for the summit tonight"

And the snow fell
And the night passed
And I talked to the strangers
While the blizzard blew

Me and the stranger, you know I don't talk to strangers
I'm a private sort of person, but a blizzard is a blizzard
And somehow I found myself sayin' you'd left me
Tellin' him everything I wanted to say to you
You know how it is when you can talk to a stranger
Someone you're quite sure you'll never see again
Soon we were laughin' and talkin' and drinkin'
He said, "You must know you're too good for him"

And the snow fell
And the night passed
And I talked to the stranger
While the blizzard blew

The stranger said, "Love, it can cry you a river
Me, I'm a loner 'cause I can't take the heartache
And sometimes I'm a fighter when I get too much whiskey
Here, have a little whiskey, pretend you don't give a damn
My cabin's up here on the side of the mountain
You can go up there and sleep through the blizzard"
I put on my parka, said goodbye to the owner
Followed the stranger through the snow up the mountainside

Woke in the morning to the sun on the snow
My car was buried in six feet of snow drifts
They dug me out, just the owner and the stranger
Sent me on my way when the snowplow had been by
And the roads were all clear and the sun on the mountain
Sparkled like diamonds on the Peak to Peak Highway
Then I knew that I would get over you
Knew you could leave me but you'd never break me

Colorado, Colorado
When the world leaves you shivering
And the blizzard blows
When the snow flies and the night falls
There's a light in the window
And a place called home
