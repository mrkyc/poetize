All through the day, I'm seein' your face on replay
Like a movie in my mind, 'til I barely even see my real life
All through the night time, I lie and relive the last time
Thinkin' 'bout the night you stayed here
You get me high and then you disappear
And you're making me laugh when you say you wonder
How I feel about you

You have no idea
How many times I think about you
How many nights I've been waitin' to love you
How much I've come to need you (I've come to need you), come to need
You have no idea
How many ways I dream about you
How many days I've been waitin' to touch you
Now that I've come to need you (I've come to need you)
I'm so in love, you have no idea

Why can't I hold you?
Why can't I be the one who, who you wake and who you lie with?
Who you laugh and dry your eyes with?
And I'm shaking my head when you say you don't know
If I really want you
You might also like
You have no idea
How many times I think about you
How many nights I've been waitin' to love you
How much I've come to need you (I've come to need you), come to need
You have no idea
How many times I think about you
How many times I've been waitin' to love you
How much I've come to need you (I've come to need you), come to need

And now you wanna know how I'm sure
That you're just who I'm looking for
But we should go out together more
'Cause you still make me laugh out loud
When you say you wonder how I feel about you
How I feel about you

You have no idea
How many times I think about you
How many nights I've been waitin' to love you
How much I've come to need you, come to need
You have no idea
How many ways I dream about you
How many days I've been waitin' to touch you
Now that I've come to need you
