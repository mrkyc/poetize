Woke up, wrong side of the bed
Baby, it's my birthday
One more year closer to death
Couldn't be a worse day
That smile ain't nothin' to you
You make it look so easy
I walked up into here
Trying to buy a can of beer
Walked out with a case of wine

(Smile) I like it when you smile (I do)
I like it when you look me up and down and say
"Boy, have you got the time?"
(Smile) I like it when you smile (I do)
Just a little thing like that
Could put a spring up in my stride

I don't mind once in a while
You take advantage of me
Go ahead, go the extra mile but girl
You don't have to love me
Come on, say "have a good day"
And you really mean it
I try to pretend again and again
Waitin' for luck but I never know when
Sleep on the floor when I stay with my friends
Always wake up angry!

(Smile) I like it when you smile (I do)
Just a little thing like that
Could put a spring up in my stride

(I like it when you smile)
I like it when you smile
Hey, hey
I like it when I play it cool and then you
Burn me like a blazin' fire
(I like it when you smile)
I like it when you smile
The way you got mine
I like it when you knock me off my feet
Baby, make me walk the wire
Can I get your attention?
The way you got mine?
Can I get your attention?
Don't even walk the line

Listen, baby when you smile like that
I guess if I got with the feeling was like
You gave me a spike of my heart-(Break)
You're an emotional defibrillator
But greater (Greater; I'll have another one of those)
I'm really not trying to oppose myself
But you make me juxtapose myself
Expose myself
Just came enough to compose myself
(Smile) I like it when you smile (I do)

I like it when you smile
Hey-hey (I do)
I like it when I play it cool and then you
Burn me like a blazin' fire
(I like it when you smile)
I like it when you smile
(I do)
I like it when you do, mm
You like it, mm
