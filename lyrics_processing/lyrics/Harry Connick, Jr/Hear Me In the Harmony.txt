The city don't even matter
I could be anywhere
I don't care
There's a whole lotta hard workin people
That could take my place
And it's easy to leave
When nobody knows your face
(Close your eyes) Just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
You can hear me in the harmony

Well, I came up in New Orleans
Fixin' what I could find
To peace my mind
I gave what I had to the winners
Just to get along
But it's really hard to sing
When nobody hears your song
(Close your eyes) Just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
You can hear me in the harmony

I thought I learned from getting burned
I bought a suit of armor and a silver cane
I found a little man who'd be proud of me
But he had to get up early
And I had to get back to my pain, yeah
You might also like
I'll just keep on livin'
One day they'll ask for me
I'll be free
And if there's a heaven
I'll be ready for my life to begin
But I wonder if I call
If they're gonna let me in
(Open your eyes) Open your eyes (Your eyes)
You can hear me in the harmony (Alright, mmm)
