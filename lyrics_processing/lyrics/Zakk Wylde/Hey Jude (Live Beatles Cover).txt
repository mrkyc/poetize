Spent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that we're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey; I wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems
