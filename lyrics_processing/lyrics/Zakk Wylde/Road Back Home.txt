I look around, see that times ain't changed
Same old faces and same old names
All the things we thought we knew
You lie to me, and I lie to you

Now all this time, you never ever sympathize
All this time, can't find my way back inside

What you give is what you get
But you drew the line on me, baby
Tears falling free, but you can't see, child
I'm just a touch away, baby

Tell me where am I now, oh-oh, why, where and how
Show me the road back home, oh yeah
Tell me where am I now, oh-oh, why, where and how
Show me the road back home, back home

The pain blew in like a hurricane
Stranger in this town bearing your name
Trapped in the silence with my memories
It's cutting me deep and it's tellin' me, yeah

All this time, you never ever sympathize
All this time, I can't find my way back inside

Going nowhere and I'm headed there fast
And I don't mean maybe
The light is getting low and my touch is growing cold
Oh, just hold me, baby

Tell me where am I now, oh-oh, why, where and how
Show me the road back home, oh yeah
Tell me where am I now, oh-oh, why, where and how
Show me the road back home, back home


What you give is what you get
But you drew the line on me, baby
Tears falling free, but you can't see, child
It's just a touch away, baby

Tell me where am I now, oh-oh, why, where and how
Show me the road back home, oh yeah
Tell me where am I now, oh-oh, why, where and how
Show me the road back home, back home
