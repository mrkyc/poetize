We were friends
Yet never all that close, yeah
Two different people, Lord
I guess yeah, I suppose, yeah
Well, I could see by the lines on your face
So much on your mind
Searchin' for someone, anyone
Something to treat you kind, oh yeah

I hope you found what you were lookin' for
'Cause I haven't seen your face around here no more
When did life become a chore?
When was it that you couldn't take it anymore?
With nothin' above you and nothin' below
Couldn't cure the need for somewhere else to go
I just hope that ya found
What it was, what it was, you were lookin' for

Sweep all your fears
Beneath the rug there on the floor
Shed a new skin
No longer insecure
Your livin' harder, yeah, harder than you know
Tell me, how fast, how fast
Can ya burn? (Can you burn?)
And how far can ya go?
