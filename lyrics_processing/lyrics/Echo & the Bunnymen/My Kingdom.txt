I chop and I change and the mystery thickens
There's blood on my hands and you want me to listen
To brawn and to brain when the truth's in the middle
Born of the grain like all good riddles

B-b-burn the skin off and climb the rooftop
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your king-kingdom, kingdom, kingdom

You kill when you talk and the enemy weakens
Your words start to walk when you're not even speaking
If my heart is a war, its soldiers are bleeding
If my heart is a war, its soldiers are dead

B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the rooftop
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

I've lost and I've gained and while I was thinking
You cut off my hands when I wanted to twist
If you know how to dance to Boney Moronie
He's doing the ballet on both of his wrists

B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the rooftop
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your k-k-k-k-k-kingdom, k-k-k-k-k-
B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the rooftop

Your king-kingdom, kingdom, kingdom

You're a bitter, maligned person
And your de-de-de-death is well overdue
King of pain
King of pain
You suck the blood that kills you
King of pain
You kiss the hand that hates you
King of pain
You're a bitter, maligned person
King of pain
And your de-de-death is well overdue
King of pain
King of pain
King of pain
You are sucking the blood that kills you
