(Christmas ain't the same)
Oh, girl
Christmas ain't the same without you
Waiting for the day I'll see you again

It's Christmas night, I'm by the fireside wishing that you and I
Could share our love one last time
And baby I, I need you near me
Right here with me for eternity, oh
Exchanging gifts of warmth and tenderness
Holding you close, this is my Christmas wish

Christmas ain't the same without you
It just doesn't feel like it used to
Waiting for the day I'll see you again (Until I see you again)
I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then

Baby, I made some mistakes that I truly regret inside
(Why can't we give one more try?)
I loved you, girl, with all my heart
Right from the start
Thought we'd never part, oh no
Craving your touch and your eternal bliss
That is my only Christmas wish
You might also like
Christmas ain't the same without you
It just doesn't feel like it used to
Waiting for the day I'll see you again (Until I see you again)
I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then (Oh, girl)
Christmas ain't the same without you (Christmas ain't the same without you)
It just doesn't feel like it used to
Waiting for the day I'll see you again (Until I see you again)
I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then

Oh, no, no, no
(I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then)
Oh
(Christmas ain't the same without you)
The same

Christmas ain't the same without you (Christmas ain't the same)
It just doesn't feel like it used to
Waiting for the day I'll see you again (Until I see you again)
I hold my breath and pray to the stars for you 'til then (You 'til then)
Christmas ain't the same without you (Christmas ain't the same without you)
It just doesn't feel like it used to
Waiting for the day I'll see you again (Until I see you again)
