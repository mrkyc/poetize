There's a fire that burns my soul's desire
Touching me, like the sun
Here and now I give my love so faithfully
That I will always be the one
I wanna stay with you tonight
I don't wanna leave
Cause I feel the time is right
Don't wanna go before I say
What I have to say
Don't ask me to walk away
I wanna stay the night, wanna stay the night
Holding you close to me
The first time that your body moved with mine
Let the moon ease your fears
Caressing as I whisper in your ear
That I will always be the one
I wanna stay with you tonight
I don't wanna leave
Cause I feel the time is right
Don't wanna go before I say
What I have to say
Don't ask me to walk away
I wanna stay the night, wanna stay the night
