Love, I see forever in your eyes
I can see heaven in your smile
And when I hold you close
I don't want to let go
Because deep in my soul I know, girl
That you are the only light I see
Your love means everything to me
I know that we will never part
'Cause you'll always be near, here in my heart

If the sun(sun) should refuse to rise
And the moon doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change, seasons rearrange
When the world is through
I will still love you
Girl, you're like an angel from above
Sent here to shower me with your love
Hold me beneath your wings
Tell me all of those things
All the hopes and the dreams we can share
'Cause I'll be your shelter from the storm
I'll be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll be your light in the dark
'Cause you'll always be here in my heart
Oh girl
You might also like
If the sun(if the sun) should refuse to rise
And the moon(oon) doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change, seasons rearrange
When the world is through
I will still love you
If anything could last forever
It's what I feel for you
(That's what I feel for you)
Oh, baby, you've touched my heart in ways
That words could never say
That's why I'll always love you

If the sun(sun) should refuse to rise
And the moon(oon yeah) doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change, seasons rearrange
When the world is through
I will still love you

If the sun should refuse to rise(oh yeah)
And the moon doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change(tide won't change), seasons rearrange(rearrange)
When the world is through
I will still love you
Yes I will, love you still baby
I will still love you
Girl, believe, you're all I need
