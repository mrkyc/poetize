Youll be able to carry a tune
Imma take you to school
And teach you how to use this microphone

Ill make you scream at the top of your lungs
Like oh oh oh whoa

Hey lady, grab the microphone
And say do-re-mi-fa-so-oh-oh-oh
Yeah baby, youre wound up and ready to blow
Like do-re-mi-fa-so-oh-oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh

Hey lady, grab the microphone
And say do-re-mi-fa-so-oh-oh-oh
