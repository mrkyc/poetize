No more admiring you from afar
You walk by and I get weak in the knees
I can get next to you and I get dizzy dizzy
The way you look, the way that you move
Your body's tellin' me that I can't lose
You and me, we're meant to be
I get next to you and I get dizzy dizzy
My head is spinning round and round
You've got me feeling like my feet aren't on the ground
What is this power that you have over me
I get next to you and I get dizzy dizzy
I don't know just what to do
I've been in love but this is something new
You're the one for me and it's plain to see
I get next to you and I get dizzy dizzy
When my eyes open I wanna see your face
Spendin' my days in your sweet embrace
Just one night with you could set me free
I get next to you and I get dizzy dizzy
You make me think of things to come
I'm dreamin' day and night of making love
I don't know what you're doing to me
I get next to you and I get dizzy dizzy

Rap: Down with 98 Degrees
Girl do you wanna get with me
'Cause sexually it's plain to see
That the way you move is making me dizzy
I don't know just what to do
I need some lovin' girl to help pull me through
I'm feelin' you I know it's true
I got nothin' but love for you
So baby shake it from side to side
Your sex appeal can't be denied
Got just one chance to make it right
And girl you know tonight's the night
So baby up and down, all around
Shake your booty to the ground
Take my hand and follow me
