The search for strength to carry on
My every hope had seemed to die
My eyes had no more tears to cry
Then like the sunshine from up above
You surrounded me with your endless love
And all the things I couldn't see
Are now so clear to me
You are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray
On bended knee
That you will always be
My everything
Now all my hopes and all my dreams
Are suddenly reality (suddenly reality)
You've opened up my heart to feel (to feel)
A kind of love that's truly real
A guiding light that'll never fade (never fade)
There's not a thing in life that I would ever trade
For the love you give and won't let go
I hope you'll always know
You might also likeYou are my everything
Nothing your love won't bring
My life is yours alone
The only love I've ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray
On bended knee
That you will always be
My everything
Ohh, you're the breath of life in me
The only one that sets me free
And you have made my soul complete for all time
For all time
You are my everything (you are my everything)
Nothing your love won't bring (nothing your love won't bring)
My life is yours alone (alone)
The only love I've ever known (the only love I've ever known)
Your spirit pulls me through (your spirit pulls me through)
When nothing else will do (when nothing else will do)
