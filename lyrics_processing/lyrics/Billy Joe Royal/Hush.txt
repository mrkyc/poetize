Na, na-na, na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na

There's a certain little girl that's on my mind
Great gosh almighty, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I've ever had
But sometimes she sure makes me feel so bad

Na, na-na, na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name, now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same, now
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name, now
Hush, hush
I need her loving, and I'm not ashamed, now
You might also like
(Hush, hush) Early in the morning
(Hush, hush) Late in the midnight
(Hush, hush) I want it, and I need it, now
(Hush, hush) Got to, got to have it

She's got love that's like quicksand
And all it only took was a touch of her hand
It blew my mind, and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat, y'all, and I can't sleep

Na, na-na, na
Na-na, na
Na-na, na

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name, now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same, now
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name, now
Hush, hush
I need her loving, and I'm not ashamed, now
(Hush, hush) Early in the morning
(Hush, hush) Late in the midnight
(Hush, hush) I want it, and I need it, y'all
(Hush, hush) Got to, got to have it

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name, now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same, now
Hush, hush
Didn't y'all hear her calling my name, now?
Hush, hush
I need her loving, and I'm not ashamed, now

(Hush, hush) Whoa, in the morning
(Hush, hush) Late in the evening
(Hush, hush) I want it, and I need it, now
(Hush, hush) Got to, got to have it

(Hush, hush) Whoa
(Hush, hush) Yeah
(Hush, hush) Early in the evening
(Hush, hush) Lord, in the midnight
(Hush, hush) Got to, got to have it
(Hush, hush) Early in the evening
(Hush, hush) Hush, hush
(Hush, hush) Hush, hush
