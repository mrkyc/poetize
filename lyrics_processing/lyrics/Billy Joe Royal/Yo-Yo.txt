Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)

Girl, it's hard for me to see
How you got such a hold on me
First, I'm up, then I'm down
Then my heart goes around and 'round

I bet you five dollars
I'm the only fool who will climb up a string for you
And need I say I can't break away
You control everything I do

I used to be a swinger
'Til you wrapped me around your finger
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)

Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
You might also like
Turnin', turnin'
Love keeps a-burnin'
Like a fire in my heart now
We're apart now

We're back together
You keep changin' like the weather, whoops, now
Up and down like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)

Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)

Where I go and what I do
Girl, it all just depends on you
You build me up just to let me down
But I dare not to make a sound

'Cause I'm so afraid you will cast me away
Like a beat-up, worn-out toy
So I hold on tight with all my might
Just to be your lovin' boy
No matter what you say or do
I gotta bounce right back to you now
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)

Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)

Turnin', turnin'
Love keeps a-burnin'
Like a fire in my heart now
We're apart now

We're back together
You keep changin' like the weather, whoops, now
Up and down like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)

Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
Oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh, oh)
Just like a yo-yo (Just like a yo-yo)
