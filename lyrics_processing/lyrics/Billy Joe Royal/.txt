Not so fond of this love but I'm trying!
Nah, I'm sure I believed you da flyest!
Got me feeling blue with horizons!
And I know I failed with realizing that

You got me messed up!
I can't even fess up!
My feelings for you, had me juiced, had my stress up!
Well now that I've let up!
Well, I've lost everything
Can't even dance, I'm too fed up!
At 12:21 know I think about you!
Used to leave football games feeling so blue!
Cause, I never "manned up" and said "Hey" to you!
Took some advice that I never could use!
I'm feeling a way so of course you can see!
My love is now locked up now I need a key!
I loved you for you and that's facts best believe
So put that in your memories!
Ah!
 (Repeat)
I know! (I know)
You know! (You know)
You can't change me (You can't change me)
That's for sure (That's for sure)
When you see me (When you see me)
Best believe (Best believe)
That I loved you (That I loved you)
Like a dream! (Like a dream)

I loved the way that you played with my heart!
But who even knows of the games we played for love?
You took my heart from the start who even knows of the games that we played for love?
Don't!
Don't!
Don't!
Don't!
Play yourself!
Stay heartless, don't hurt yourself!
Thought you were the one but I ended up playing myself!
Yeah, I wanted the you!
Not the alternative, see that's another "-self"
But I guess I'm the one who learns to just love himself
Not to deal with the love and affection
With pure intersection
The kid who is broken is learning his lesson!
Yeah, point one I loved you!
And that's facts, I want to!
Stay together, forever, whatever
'cause you just want to!

I love the way that you played with my heart!
But who even knows of the games we played for love?
You took my heart from the start!
Who even knows of the games that we played for love
I loved the way that you played with my heart!
But who even knows of the games we played for love?
I thought that you were the one for me!
But who knows of the games that we played for love!

Still love you
Still love you
Still love you
Yah!
Woah!
Yeah!
The way you make me so blue!
Lost without the juice!
Made me come up out the womb!
Lost my focus without you!
What could I do?
