I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain sometime
When you take you gotta give
So live and let live
Or let go now, now, now
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond ring
But you don't find roses growin' in fields of clover
So girl, think it over
If sweet-talkin' you would make it come true
I'd give you the world right now on a silver platter
But it doesn't really matter

So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come on and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain sometime
When you take you gotta give
So live and let live
Or let go now, now, now
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
You might also like
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd rather let you go
But there's one thing you oughta know
Look before you leap, still water runs deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
Girl, I know what I'm talkin' about

So smile for a while, and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come on and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain sometime
When you take you gotta give
So live and let live
Or let go now, now, now
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
I beg your pardon
