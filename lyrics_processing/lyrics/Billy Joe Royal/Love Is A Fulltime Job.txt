It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
'Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feelin'
And not for the single minded
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
Walkin' through my mind
Reflecting on my failures
I hope to God this time
I've learned to do it better
'Cause I've already lost control
And fallen in love again
And I don't care what it takes
I'll even put a little overtime in it
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
'Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feelin'
And not for the single minded
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
The passion in your kiss
Brings more to me than pleasure
It reminds me of this
That's love's the only treasure
Don't you know how good it feels
To be with you tonight
After all these years of tryin'
Love's finally gonna turn out right
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
It's not for the faint of heart
'Cause you could get hurt or blinded
It's not a part time feelin'
Not for the single minded
Love is a full time job
It's good work if you can find it
