I'd give anything, go anywhere when it comes to your love
But the question that's burning in my heart is whether it's strong enough
If you want me to stay, there's something we gotta do
Honesty is a must, I've got to trust if I'm not with you, hey

Ain't nowhere I belong
If I'm not with you
Ain't no place I call home
If I'm not with you
Constantly on the phone
If I'm not with you
If I'm not with you
If I'm not with you
Don't know if I can trust
If I'm not with you
All of these questions 'cause
If I'm not with you
Hope you're respecting us
If I'm not with you
If I'm not with you, baby

And I love it when it's just the two of us laying around
And I can't help, I want you to myself
The feeling's getting stronger now
So, I hope you feel the way I feel (I feel)
Honesty is a must, I've got to trust if I'm not with you, uh

I'm hoping I'm everything you need
And that all you wish for, you'll find in me
It's the way that you show
Show you care, show that you love
