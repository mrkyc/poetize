That's my joint
Yeah gimme that beat
What's the point, we ain't being low-key
We ain't getting no sleep

Me and my crew all dressed up
We 'bout to hit these streets, 'bout to make niggas fall in love
Out here swerving, not giving a fuck
Cause we about to do it, do it, do it 'til the break of that sun come up

We've been doing this shit a long time
We just poured our shot then we go get our life
I said, we've been doing this shit a long time
We just pull up, hop out, walk right up inside

We say, that's my joint, yeah, gimme that beat
What's the point, we ain't being low-key
Fuck it though, we ain't getting no sleep

What's the point, we ain't being low-key
Fuck it though, we ain't getting no sleep
