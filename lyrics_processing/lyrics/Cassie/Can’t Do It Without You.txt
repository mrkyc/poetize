I can't believe how you got me
And you love me this way (this way)
I can't do it without you, babe (do it without you, baby)
Don't ever leave, 'cause it's so sweet
How you love me this way (this way)
I can't do it without you, can't do it without you, baby

It's the special way we touch (touch)
How you cater to my needs
And the way you show you care for me (show you care for me, yeah)
It's the look in your eyes (eyes)
When you tell me that you're mine
And the way you're always there for me (for me)
It's no wonder why I feel this way

Thought about this love of ours
How intense it really is
And I figured it out
I'll never find better love than the love you give
And I can't think without you
Not a doubt, that you're the one I need (oh no)
Look how far we've come, since day one
This is how it's supposed to be
You might also like
I can't believe how you got me
And you love me this way (this way)
I can't do it without you, babe (do it without you, baby)
Don't ever leave, 'cause it's so sweet
How you love me this way (love me this way)
I can't do it without you, can't do it without you, baby

It's the burning deep inside (inside)
It's too hard to be denied
It's the feeling when you're right there to hold me (right there to hold me)
And incase you ever have a doubt
I wanna let you know this right now (I'm yours)
Uh, you give me all the reason I need

Thought about this love of ours (all I need)
How intense it really is
And I figured it out
I'll never find better love than the love you give
Betcha can't think without you
Not a doubt, that you're the one I need (I need)
Look how far we've come, since day one
This is how it's supposed to be (can't believe)
I can't believe how you got me
And you love me this way (this way)
I can't do it without you, babe (do it without you, baby)
Don't ever leave, 'cause it's so sweet
How you love me this way (love me this way)
I can't do it without you, can't do it without you, baby

Don't know what I'd do if
I didn't have you with me
Don't think I could make it
Through a single day without you
Don't know what I'd do if
I didn't have you, baby
Don't think I could make it
Through a single day without you (single day)

I can't believe how you got me
And you love me this way (this way)
I can't do it without you, babe (do it without you, baby)
Don't ever leave, 'cause it's so sweet
How you love me this way (this way)
