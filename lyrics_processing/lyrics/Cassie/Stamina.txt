Homie, won't you put it on me
Boy, I'm anxious and I'm kinda horny
I wanna get
So close I could feel your breath
So hot that you make me sweat
Hot-hot-hot-hot
Lonely, baby
If you're lonely
Follow me and don't forget the room key
And you can get
So close you can see my goosebumps
Closer than you can touch

I know this room is full of spectators, some are haters
Middle finger, I'll return the favor so
Let's give 'em something to talk about
Something they could write a book about
Let me help you outta your seats
Take off your shoes, it's too hot
For what we 'bout to do, boy
Let's get this room excited
I bet they wanna be invited

I got that sexy love, nasty love
Better get your camera love
So bring your stamina, stamina
Baby, I can handle ya
I got that sexy love, nasty love
Better get your camera love
So bring your stamina, stamina
Baby, I can handle ya

I'm nasty, baby, if you ask me
I'ma let you call me Miss Cassie
I wanna get
So hot that we 'bout to faint
Don't stop till we peel the paint
Hot-hot-hot-hot
Acting, baby this ain't acting
But I love it when the camera's flashing
So let 'em get
So close they could see my goosebumps
Closer than they can touch

I know this room is full of spectators, some are haters
Middle finger, I'll return the favor so
Let's give 'em something to talk about
Something they could write a book about
Let me help you outta your seats
Take off your shoes, it's too hot
For what we 'bout to do, boy
