We've been through this a thousand times
And I've never been more sure then I am right now
(Cassie, uh)
Shh... Please, don't say anything
It's just about that time

I guess it's about time that I'm finally movin' on
I don't really care if it's right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
Know it's gon' be better for both of us
It hurts like hell, but I got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
Think it's finally time that I'm movin' on

Ooh, I can't stop the way I love you
I've got to let this go
Although we've tried
Doesn't really matter no more
And I don't know what I stay here for
Especially when I know I gotta
I gotta make a move, I know that I do, oh
You might also like
I guess it's about time that I'm finally movin' on
I don't really care if it's right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
Know it's gon' be better for both of us
It hurts like hell, but I got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
Think it's finally time that I'm movin' on

Don't tell me I should stay, it's too late now
To think we can make this work somehow
You should know the truth, it's over
Over and done, ooh, and I can't believe
All of this time you've had me thinkin'

Thinkin' you would call me late night
Knowin' damn well you wouldn't do it (Tellin' me I was still on)
Tellin' me I was still on your mind (Your mind)
I don't know why you had to put me through it (And I'm thinkin' I'm)
And I'm thinkin' I'm still livin' for your love
It was all over and you knew it
Though it's gon' be hard to let this go
Boy, this is somethin' I gotta do, ooh whoa
I guess it's about time that I'm finally movin' on
I don't really care if it's right or wrong
And in spite of the way I love your touch
Know it's gon' be better for both of us (And it hurts like hell)
It hurts like hell, but I got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
Think it's finally time that I'm movin' on

Gave you all of my heart, all of my body
All of my soul, all of my precious time
And you know it's so hard loving somebody
And I loved you so good, baby, you can't deny
But you know this time that we spent just got away
Let it fade away
And the only way to heal is to give me time and space (Uh)
And I guess it's time...

I guess it's about time that I'm finally movin' on (I don't know)
I don't really care if it's right or wrong (In spite of the way)
And in spite of the way I love your touch (Said I know)
Know it's gon' be better for both of us (Ooh, it's gonna hurt babe)
It hurts like hell, but I got to try
You already know the reason why
So no matter who's right or wrong
