I find it funny, baby, how you can just watch
Me pour out all my feelings and you not pull up
On me, when you know that's what I need
Baby why do you lead me blind, knowing your perspective's not mine

Baby I love getting a rise out of you, but not in this way
We need to take it to the place where we lay, baby
I can cool you off with this water babe, you let me know
Do you want a taste of flavor? Baby, let's go
We don't have to argue, I don't wanna argue with you
Baby I just wanna heart you
I picture myself on you when I'm not with you
And baby that's all I really wanna do, is be on you
So can we do all this another time?

Speaking of time
Baby we gotta take
Full advantage, not take for granted, no, no
Speaking of time
We both have our lives
So when we cross paths, we shouldn't
Di-divide, -vide it up
I need all of you, I can't lie
You might also like
When you rub your hands down my side to my thighs
Is it heated? Punish me, you know I need it
Baby it's no secret, come talking reckless, come and beat it

Baby I love getting a rise out of you, but not in this way
