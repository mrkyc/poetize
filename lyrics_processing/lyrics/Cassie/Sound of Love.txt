Every time you hear my music
Oh, oh whoa, whoa

Feelings I ain't never had before
You got my head turning, baby
I'm feeling I ain't gotta look no more
'Cause you're what I've been searching for lately

So if you're thinking about changing up, then boy, you're crazy
Take me to another place and make me your lady
Because I'm ready, damn, boy, I'm ready
To be your one and only girl

You make it hard for me to breathe whenever you're around
Huh, huh, huh
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around
That's the sound of love

Temperature is rising, baby girl, I know you like it
When I see your face, baby, I get so, so excited
But I don't know what to do (No)
I don't know what to say (Say)
'Cause you're what I've been searching for lately, yeah
You might also like
So if you're thinking about changing up, then girl, you're crazy
Take me to another place and make me your baby
'Cause girl, I'm ready, damn, girl, I'm ready
To be your one and only man (One and only)

You make it hard for me to breathe whenever you're around (Whenever you're around)
Huh, huh, huh
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around (Ah, ah)
That's the sound of love

Let me turn it up a bit, lights on, like that (Like that)
When you've had enough, all we do is kiss
And get right back (Right back)
You can take my heart baby, it's yours now
Ain't no need to fight that
I see you're on me
'Cause nobody ever made you feel like that
I, I, I know you need it, the sound's beating
My heart's waiting, our hearts waiting
Huh, huh, huh (Ah, ah, ah)
Every time we get close, our mind, body, soul, yeah
If I was the first to say it, baby
Would you feel the same? Maybe
You make it hard for me to breathe (Uh)
Whenever you're around (Yeah)
Huh, huh, huh (Ah, ah, ah)
My heart vibrates every time I sense that you're around (Ooh, oh)
That's the sound of love (Of love, love)

That's the sound of my heart
It's beating
It's waiting
Just to be loved
I don't know if I'm ready for love
