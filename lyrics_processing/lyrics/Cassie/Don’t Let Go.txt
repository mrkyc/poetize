Love me a Holladay

Loving you is easy
I get to be myself completely with you
And even when I'm broken
You keep your arms wide open, you do

More than my man, you're my homie
Got a lot of shit that you love me through
Ooh, you're the one, you're the only
Got a different smile and it's thanks to you
Be chillin' like a mofo
Even when I'm going loco
You always keep it so cool
You always keep it so cool

Baby don't let go (Light me on fire, ohh)
Baby don't let go (Can't you see my desire?)
(Baby, baby, baby, baby...)
Baby don't let go (Light me on fire, ohh)
Baby don't let go (Can't you see my desire?)
(Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't let go)
You might also like
We know we won't be perfect
But the love we got is worth it, baby
So whatever I could do for you
I'ma always come through for ya
I promise you babe, I'll be right there
There's no part of me going nowhere, nowhere

More than my man, you're my homie (My homie)
Got a lot of shit that you love me through (Love me through)
Ooh, you're the one, you're the only (My only)

You always keep it so cool (So cool)
You always keep it so cool (So cool)
