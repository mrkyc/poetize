Uh, uh
You feel that?
Uh, it must be love
Haha, yeah, it feels like love
It's Bad Boy, bitch
You know how we do

Stimulate my heart, surrender my mind (Uh-huh)
Look into my eyes and forever you'll find (Uh)
A bad boy turned good, how could it be true? (True)
And all through my pain, how could it be you? (You, you, you, you)
How could it be new? (C'mon)
How could it be my cheatin' ways through? (That's right)
How could it be it's me in pursuit, about to get a white suit
About to get a night job (Uh-huh)
Just to keep my mind grounded in you (You, you, you, you)
And all that jazz (C'mon)
What else can make a nigga spend all his cash?
A chick with a face (Uh-huh)
A chick with a little skinny waist (Uh-huh)
A chick with a mind that match her nice taste (Uh-huh)
Plus I got the mind to snatch you like weight (Keep goin')
Why you wanna tie me up like Rick James?
Reverse the Porsche
As long that you got them little high heels on, it's on (It's on)

This is somethin' I never wanted
But since I met you, I've been on it
I think about you all the time, can't get you off my mind
(I know this can't be love) I know this can't be love
(But baby it must be love) But baby it must be love, oh
Thinkin' I'm going all the way
I wanna show you, but I'm afraid
I know you say it's all on me, maybe tonight I'll let you see
(I know this can't be love) I know this must be love
(But baby it must be love) I know it must be love

Don't wanna give in to you so easily
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you're doin' to me
But I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)

I heard you whisper somethin' to me
Hold me close now, baby don't leave
Emotions taking over, somethin's controllin' me
(I know this can't be love) I know this can't be love
(But baby it must be love) But baby it must be love
What am I feelin'? It's gettin' stronger
And I can't hold it back for much longer
Although we try to be cool, it's all because of you, ooh
(I know this can't be love) I know this must be love
(But baby it must be love) Baby, it must be love
Don't wanna give in to you so easily (So easily)
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you're doin' to me
But I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)

Nah, in a minute I might have to check myself into the psych ward
I'm goin' crazy and I don't know what I'm fightin' for (Hmm, hmm)
Seems too easy to run from this
And my mind's sayin' I can't really fuck with this
Try to resist, but every passionate kiss blow my mind like a terrorist  (Ohh)
You can be mine on some forever shit (On some forever shit?)
I'm intrigued, believe me (Haha, yeah)
Try to be tough but the look in your face is so delicate (C'mon) (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
It's somethin' you doin', you got me in a trance
You got me ruing and doing shit I ain't used to doin' (That's right)
Thinkin' 'bout a chance, maybe a slow dance (Yeah)
Maybe we hold hands, fur coats in France (Keep going)
Go divin' on beaches with white diamonds in the sand (Yeah)
Then we hang gliding over Cannes (Uh-huh)
And you can be my number one fan (C'mon)
And I could be your love in the club for as long as the song lasts (Let's go)
Talk to 'em, Cass

The way you make me feel got me goin' crazy
Tell me what you doin' tonight
I'll be there right away, take a ride with you, home late
Oh, and you know I'm gonna give you my love
Boy, I'm so glad that you're mine (You're all mine)
Do you wanna spend some time with me?
Don't wanna give in to you so easily (Don't wanna give in, don't wanna fight it)
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak (You make me so weak, I can't deny it)
And I can't understand what you doin' to me (Yes, I like it)
But I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
Don't wanna give in to you so easily (Don't wanna give in, don't wanna fight it)
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak (You make me so weak, I can't deny it)
And I can't understand what you doin' to me (Yes, I like it)
