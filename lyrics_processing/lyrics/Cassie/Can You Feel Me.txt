I know you sensin' me missin' you
Must be feeling a vibe
My heart is on fire, about to explode
There's too much space between me and you
Gets hard over time, it's a crime
I'm hoping my love overflows

And finds its way for me
Into your arms, where I belong
Come to me
I'm sending love at lightning speed
I've been in need since you've been gone

Here's my love, reaching you like I wanted
Call my name and I'll come running
Lovesick, boy I need you to heal me
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca-can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca-can you feel me? (me, me, me, me, me)
Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca-can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca-can you feel me? (me, me, me, me, me)

I'm hoping my love will fly

And find its way for me
Into your arms, where I belong
Come to me
I'm sending love at lightning speed
I've been in need since you've been gone

Here's my love, reaching you like I wanted
Call my name and I'll come running
Lovesick, boy I need you to heal me
Can you feel me?
