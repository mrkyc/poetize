Maybe I'm tired
Maybe I'm just wiser
Brand new, I'm so brand new
Maybe I'm done fightin'
Feel good, but don't feel right
Maybe it's just timin'
Maybe I'm just findin' me

I think that I'll run, run so fast that I can't stop
I think it'd be fun, fun to just chill when I wake up
Oh what I have I done, done, outside with no makeup
I think the best things in life are freedom

It's the simple things in life (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the way you blow my mind (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
You wanna see me get excited (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the simple things in life (Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah)

Feels like I'm floatin'
These days I'm open
Brand new, I'm so brand new
On her, I'm focused
Old me, don't notice me
Don't wear the same clothing
Just where I'm supposed to be
You might also like
I think that I'll run, run so fast that I can't stop
I think it'd be fun, fun to just chill when I wake up
Oh what I have I done, done, outside with no makeup
I think the best things in life are freedom

It's the simple things in life (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the way you blow my mind (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
You wanna see me get excited (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the simple things in life (Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah)

It's the simple things
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the simple things
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the simple things
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the simple things
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Ohh

It's the simple things in life (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the way you blow my mind (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
You wanna see me get excited (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
It's the simple things in life (Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah)
It's the simple things in life
It's the way you blow my mind
You wanna see me get excited
It's the simple things in life
It's the simple things in life
It's the way you blow my mind
You wanna see me get excited
