Turn the lights on

I don't wanna scream
I don't even wanna tell you how good it is
Because if it's a dream
I'd only wake myself up
And baby I don't wanna ruin this

Honestly, I was scared 'cause
I know you were prepared
And you knew what I was thinking
All my thoughts, all my cares

Then we made love on the balcony
Right there, in New York City
I saw the tourists staring back at me
In Times Square, in New York City
And in that moment the city was all ours

I said she sassy, she classy (Classy)
Haircut like she Cassie (Cassie)
Why your voice so raspy?
Ooh I hope she nasty (Yeah)
Last night, it was kush and Ciroc, yeah, Supafreak
Told 'em "Put it on my black card", get a super suite
We could do it right now (Right now)
Girl I don't give a fuck
Right here in the valet
We can do it in the truck
Legs on the dashboard
Yeah, I got her balled up (Damn)
Maybe it's the kush or the heat
But it's fogged up, gone
You might also like
Had a couple drinks
Lit a L, it was perfect
Started enjoying the scenery
We couldn't help it
All things have their purpose

The wind it blew through my hair, love
I was stunned by your stare
From the sight of you standing there, love
I could walk, walk on air

Then we made love on a balcony
Right there, in New York City
I saw the tourists staring back at me (They were all staring back at me)
In Times Square, in New York City (Yeah)
And in that moment the city was all ours

Started off on the floor (Floor)
Ended it up on a dresser (Yeah!)
Baby girl name is Pam
Why I just called her Vanessa? (Yeah yeah)
I'm on the balcony stylin'
I got her legs on the rail (Yeah yeah)
I locked that thing out the frame
Like I just got out of jail (Woo!)
She said "Young, don't you quit"
She said "Young, don't you stop"
She said "You happy to see me?"
I said "No girl, that's my Glock"
She said "You're G to the heart"
"You just so stuck in your ways"
I said "Girl, what you mean?"
"Why you still got on your J's?"
I said they just dropped today
So I'mma keep on my shoes
And you keep moaning like that
Then we gon' be on the news
I like bitches with money
She likes niggas with power
She said "Let's do it again"
"But this time in the shower", gone
Then we made love on a balcony
Right there, in New York City (City, City)
I saw the tourists staring back at me (They were all staring back at me)
In Times Square, in New York City
And in that moment the city was all ours
