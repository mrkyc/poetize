Ah, Danja and the Clutch
I miss you girl, I miss you girl
I'ma make you my official girl

Listen, today makes it a year
Don't you think it's time that you made it clear?
You gotta get on your biz
Tell me what it ain't or what it is, I can handle it
I've had it up to here, I don't wanna pressure you, dear
I've sent back to back dudes away from my door
Thinking I was spoken for, not anymore

And I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of being your (Your) unofficial girl (Unofficial girl)
And I'm tired, I'm tired of trying (Ooh, but I'm still your)
I'm still your (Your) unofficial girl

(You gotta learn to love)
You gotta love me in the light and the dark
You gotta give me, give me all of your heart
I wanna be your (Be your) official girl (Official girl)
Said I wanna, wanna, wanna be your (Be your) official girl
I wanna be your official girl
I wanna be your official girl (Official girl), official girl

If you keep this up, there's bound to be a mess
'Cause I ain't really like the rest
Put to the test, I can surely pass (Yeah)
You better do the math
I'm so stylish (Check), so bossy (Check)
It'd be a shame to say you lost me
But if you want that, it's a wrap and I won't look back (And I won't look back)

And I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Of being your (Your) unofficial girl (Unofficial girl)
And I'm tired, I'm tired of trying (Hey, oh, whoa)

Aha, shorty say she wanna be my official
Bang bang, I ain't talking no pistol
Ain't no violence, ain't no silence
'Cause she scream to the top of her
When I get on top of her, sounding like an opera
Skip, drop, hopping her, got her feeling popular
Got her feeling like she's, she's my official girl
Yeah, you so special girl
I'll never diss you and I'll kiss you on your little pearl
I know that you like that baby, yeah you like that baby
I know I can make you come right back baby, oh

I'ma make you my official girl
You better act right
I'm two seconds from being out the door
Uh, I miss you girl, I miss you girl
I'ma make you my official girl
Said I won't be with you unofficially anymore
And I can't make you choose
Long as you're cool on knowing
You're 'bout to blow a good thing
And I ain't making ultimatums
I'ma tell you like this verbatim

And I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired (And I'm tired, I'm tired)
Of being your (Your) unofficial girl (Don't wanna be unofficially yours)
And I'm tired, I'm tired of trying (Ah, and I'm so tired of trying to make you see me)
I'm still your (Your) unofficial girl (Don't wanna be unofficially, unofficial girl, you better learn, learn, learn)

(You gotta learn to love)
You gotta love me in the light and the dark
You gotta give me, give me all of your heart
